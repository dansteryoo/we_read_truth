        "devo_summary": "\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nLast week, my friend Jonathan and I were exchanging messages on Instagram. He recently moved to Austin, Texas, and I was eager to hear stories of good fortune that would render such a gutsy move successful. “Are you seeing lots of fruit in your new life?” I asked. As soon as I’d asked the question, my expectations felt too narrow. I wanted “fruit” to mean visible, positive affirmation of the right choice. Instead of answering directly, Jonathan shared some meandering thoughts typical of his introspective personality. “There’s never enough fruit to me. I heard Matthew McConaughey say that Austinites should focus on contributing more than consuming. I think he nailed it.” \nMy friend then put the question back on me: “So, how would you define fruit?” I was grateful for the push-back but also low-grade irritated—mostly because I didn’t feel like using my brain that late in the day. Now I had to confront, and possibly deconstruct, what I thought I meant, because my friend was just shrewd enough (and kind enough) not to leave me holding onto a half-baked idea.\nJesus loved a good, piercing question. Certainly, some of them were rhetorical, leaving people in a tongue-tied state like the ancient Near Eastern version of a mic drop. Some of them required a response right then and there. All of them were meant to go straight for the heart. “Who do the people say the Son of Man is?” Jesus asked His disciples while in Caesarea Philippi (Matthew 16:13). \nAt the time, there were lots of rumors about who Jesus was: John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah (v.14). The disciples knew from the Prophets that the Messiah would have a “vast” dominion and establish a kingdom with “justice and righteousness” (Isaiah 9:7), but they didn’t know how this would play out specifically. \nJesus didn’t ask the disciples who people thought the Son of Man was because He needed to know. It was a tool for unearthing His second question: “But you… who do you say that I am?” (Matthew 16:15). In the end, it doesn’t matter what everybody else thinks. Each of us must answer Jesus’s question for ourselves.\nSimon Peter was convinced that Jesus was the Messiah, “the Son of the living God” (v.16), and Scripture tells us that he didn’t just get the answer right by chance. It was the Father, not “flesh and blood,” that had done its work in Peter and revealed this divine knowledge (v.17). \nI’m so grateful for Jesus—and for thoughtful friends on Instagram—who ask penetrating questions that have our best interests in mind. Ones that weed out hearsay, clichés, and half-truths to get to the important questions somewhere below. I’m grateful that our Lord is always most concerned with our one-on-one relationship with Him and longs for us to seek and trust His voice above all others.\n“So, how do you define bearing fruit?” “Who do you say that I am?”\nThese questions lead to the type of knowledge and divine connections that Christ is building His beautiful Church upon.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nMy sister and I hopped onto the genetic-testing train last year. For Christmas, we gave our parents test kits and joined over twelve million customers in search of our ancestry. We are a people fascinated by our origins, hungry for the past to shed light on our present. \nFamily heritage held deep, sacred meaning for ancient Jewish people as well. While the modern identity question is, “Who am I?”, the defining question of ancient Israel was, “Whose am I?” Just read the detailed genealogies in the Old Testament. From Abraham to Ruth to David—origins, birthrights, and family connections formed identity and destiny. \nSo, it’s no wonder that Jesus’s listeners confidently held out their status as Abraham’s descendants and flashed it as their badge of honor and worth. Yet this over-dependence on heritage was dangerous. It offered a false sense of security, a misguided sense of racial superiority, and spiritual blindness.\nOne of Jesus’s disciples, John, records how many Jews were in denial of their need for rescue. They would not accept Jesus’s controversial teaching, which told them that even they, God’s chosen people, were spiritually lost and in desperate need of a Savior. When told that the truth would set them free, they bristled and held up their heritage as proof of their right standing with God. They told Jesus, “We are Abraham’s descendants… and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say, ‘You will become free’?” (John 8:33).\nJesus does more than poke holes in their heritage badges. He blasts the shaky ground they are standing on and reveals the true, firm foundation that provides the only way of salvation. Ancestry does not determine identity and destiny. But there is something—Someone—who does. And so Jesus answers them: “Truly I tell you, before Abraham was, I am” (v.58). \nBoom! His Jewish challengers are no doubt shocked by His outrageous claims. How could this man say these things? Jesus is equating Himself with Yahweh, leaving no room for misunderstanding. This man from Nazareth has the audacity to echo the words of God, who spoke to Moses through a burning bush and revealed His own name, “I AM WHO I AM” (Exodus 3:14). They know exactly what Jesus is claiming—that He, not a bloodline from Abraham, is the way of salvation and true freedom. \nWe, too, should be stunned, jolted by Jesus’s words. They are scandalous. But our family tree and our connections don’t define us. What we do, where we come from, who we associate with—none of these things can make us right with God. This is personal, and this is cosmic. We need a rescue from outside of ourselves, what theologian Martin Luther called an “alien righteousness.”\n“For this reason God highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,  so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow—in heaven and on earth and under the earth— and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father” (Philippians 2:9–11). \nWe do have a sure identity, which means we also have a sure destiny. The risen Christ defines us as beloved children of God, and we are destined to have a place around His table, dwelling with Him forever. He is our firm foundation. He is our righteousness. He sets us free. \n\nPatti Sauls lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband Scott and daughters, Abby and Ellie, where they serve alongside the people of Christ Presbyterian Church.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nIn the whimsical, little village of Carmel-by-the-Sea, there’s a restaurant called Forge in the Forest. And, yes, it looks exactly like it sounds. It has a courtyard reminiscent of Disneyland’s Pixie Hollow, full of creeping vines and flowers and string lights. One of my students had recommended the place in a food review, so my friend and I pretty much planned our whole trip around having dinner there. After a day of sightseeing and beach-combing, we were way beyond that point of hunger in which you can barely form cohesive sentences. So, as you can imagine, we were giddy after ordering bacon burgers, a balsamic beet salad the size of a hoola-hoop, and chocolate lava cake garnished with raspberries. Of that meal, all I can say is, “Praise God from whom all blessings flow”—I’ll just leave it at that.\nBefore Jesus feeds the five thousand near the Sea of Galilee, He notices the crowd’s physical needs. “Where will we buy bread so that these people can eat?” he asks Philip (John 6:5). Once the disciples spot a young boy with food, Jesus uses five barley loaves and some fish to nourish the crowd’s physical hunger. He knew they wouldn’t be able to listen well if they were starving. This meal was an act of care and an entryway into relationship, where He would begin to nourish them spiritually.\nIn fact, providing above and beyond for this crowd was enough to convince them that Jesus was, in fact, the Messiah. When they saw this miracle, they said, “This truly is the Prophet who is to come into the world” (v.14). Throughout Scripture, bread is a common motif used to demonstrate God’s provision and sustenance—whether that’s the Israelites’ “bread from heaven” in the desert (v.31) or a mountainside meal. Jesus goes as far as to tell the disciples that He is the bread of life (v.35). \nOne of the earliest heresies in the church was the belief that the spiritual realm is good while the material world is evil. But we live in fragile bodies that have needs, and the way of Jesus is distinctly earthy. He walked along the dirt and fed people with fish and broke bread to symbolize His own body (Luke 22:19). Jesus doesn’t neglect the physical world for the spiritual world. This place we live in—a world with cinnamon bark and praying mantises and fresh basil—is the setting God created for us to encounter Him. \nWe have physical needs and spiritual needs, and Jesus offers to meet these while teaching us a higher way of living. Although our physical needs are great, Jesus is the nourishment that sustains us far beyond just alleviating our hunger pangs. How kind of Him to offer Himself in a way that makes little sense to us on one level, yet is exactly what we need Him to be: our “bread of life” (John 6:35), the only sustenance we will every truly need.\nAlthough there wasn’t anything particularly spiritual about that meal at Forge in the Forest, I felt God’s pleasure as I ate it. The same God who designs intricate plant life so that we can garnish our cake with raspberries also gave Himself up for us out of love. May we always remember that. \n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nDon’t get me wrong—I love the change of seasons and readily welcome autumn, but when summer begins to deflate, I want to grab on to every last drop. And then, when we begin losing daylight at a rate of two minutes per day (ugh!), I am absolutely done for. Shorter, colder days force us to come inside early and remember what it’s like to live in the darkness. Am I the only one who’s still a little afraid of the dark? \nYou and I both know we’re not strangers to the darkness. We see it every day, in every season. It’s in our conflicts and our diagnoses, our best intentions and our hurt feelings. Maybe winter feels harder because it’s just a stark, visual reflection of our sinful reality. Left to our own devices, we are people wandering in darkness (Isaiah 9:2). Since the fall in the garden, we have all been scrounging around in the pitch-black of our sin and shame, our souls in danger of never truly seeing light again.\nBut here’s what I love about the gospel: Just as we sometimes see a visual representation of the sinful nature of our souls, God gives us an everlasting image of redemption and hope in His Son, Jesus. In the Gospel of John, we read:\n“Jesus spoke to them again: “‘I am the light of the world. Anyone who follows me will never walk in the darkness but will have the light of life’” (John 8:12).\nLet’s jump in with a little bit of context here: Jesus is speaking to a crowd that included Jewish religious leaders. He is in the temple complex, and the Feast of Tabernacles is taking place. The Jews had been debating His identity because of the miracles people had seen and the authority with which He spoke. And now Jesus gives them one more outrageous statement to debate: “I am the light of the world.”\nLight was an important symbol in the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles (Leviticus 23:33–44), signifying the pillar of fire given to Israel during the exodus (Exodus 13:21). But here in John chapter 8, Jesus is saying that He Himself is the light given to His children, illuminating the way to eternal life. His declaration is for us as well. \nNow, we, as beloved children of Christ, have seen the great light of life set before us. Let us hold on to Him, our only sure hope in the midst of darkness. He is our light in this life and our eternal salvation, our stronghold in the face of all fear and dread (Psalm 27:1). May He awaken us from the darkness of our sin and our slumber of ambivalence (Ephesians 5:13–14).\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Erin Davis\n\nSheep don’t know a gate from a fence row. As a midwestern sheep farmer, I can tell you this for certain. A recent run-in with a wayward sheep proves my point. Because the proverbial grass is always greener on the other side, our sheep are constantly stretching their necks to try to nibble the grass outside the fence. Occasionally, one will barrel through the wire to get to the “good stuff” she’s been denied.\nSo it was that we discovered one of our sheep outside the pen one hot day this summer. The solution should have been easy. We simply opened the gate. But due to stubbornness or oblivion, the ewe remained outside the fold. We called and whooped, summoning her back to the comfort and safety of her flock. Instead, she kept ramming herself into the fence. Time and time again. The gate was wide open, but she defaulted to futile attempts to make her own way.\nCreation is constantly teaching us (Romans 1:20), and when it comes to revealing who Jesus is, sheep are especially good instructors. No wonder Jesus frequently asked us to envision sheep pens as He revealed His identity as “the gate for the sheep” (John 10:7). Long before Jesus spoke these words, David, once a shepherd, saw the character of the Lord (and his own identity) illustrated through his flock: “The LORD is my shepherd; I have what I need” (Psalm 23:1).\nThe theme woven throughout Scripture is this: we are like sheep, prone to wander from the fold in search of false hope that can never fully satisfy. Because our Shepherd is good, the gate to salvation is open, but we’ll never find it on our own. We try to be self-sufficient, to do all the good deeds, and we may even convince ourselves for a time that we’ve got our stuff together more than someone else. But the reality is, when left to our own devices, we will just keep ramming ourselves up against false hope and good intentions.\nJesus shows us the gate—no, actually, Jesus is the gate. He is the way. Listen for His call. Submit to His leading. Quit stubbornly ramming yourself up against your own plans. Instead, look to Jesus and enter in. He whispers to us, “I am the gate. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will come in and go out and find pasture” (John 10:9).\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nSometimes a song undoes me. Certain lyrics and melodies have a way of releasing the yearnings of my heart. So it is with these words from Robert Robinson’s hymn, “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing”: “Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it. / Prone to leave the God I love.” \nMy wandering makes me ache. \nIs it any wonder that God’s people are called sheep so often in the Bible? Sheep need a shepherd. Without guidance, they easily wander and become lost. Don’t we also veer off into uncharted territory and become disoriented? Our agendas, worries, and unbelief all lead us away from dependence on Jesus, and soon we don’t know which way to turn. \nSheep need a protector. It is dangerous for them to stray from their shepherd’s care. Unlike animals with sharp claws or speedy legs, sheep are vulnerable and defenseless. If left alone, they will likely be attacked and killed by wild animals. \nWe, too, have a predator, an enemy of our souls. Scripture tells us to “be sober-minded, be alert. Your adversary the devil is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for anyone he can devour” (1 Peter 5:8). We need a Shepherd to guide us, keep us in the fold, and protect us from our enemy.\nSheep also need a provider. They often cannot find clean water or nourishing grass on their own. They struggle to care for themselves. If sheep stumble and fall over, they cannot get back up and will die on the ground with their short legs sticking up in the air. \nWhen faced with our own suffering and confusion, we also can find ourselves wrestling in the dusty dirt of life, struggling to get back on our feet. Like sheep, we need a Shepherd to make us lie down in green pastures and rest, to lead us beside quiet waters and renew us (Psalm 23:2–3).\nDavid wrote the poetry of Psalm 23, and he intimately understood shepherding. As a boy, he tended his father’s sheep (1 Samuel 16:1–13). As King of Israel, he shepherded a nation. And in the midst of his own wandering, he wrestled in the dirt of his sin and brokenness, and realized just how desperately he needed a Shepherd (2 Samuel 11, Psalm 51).\nThrough the words of His prophet, Ezekiel, God graciously promises, “I myself will search for my flock and look after them” (Ezekiel 34:11). Jesus boldly echoes His Father and reveals His divine identity as He declares, “I am the good shepherd” who “lays down his life for the sheep” (John 10:11). \nLike David, Jesus lovingly tends his Father’s sheep. Like David, Jesus wrestled in the dirt of sin—but it wasn’t His sin. It was ours. Jesus conquered sin and death, just as John the Baptist boldly proclaimed He would: “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29) The Good Shepherd willingly became the ultimate sacrificial Lamb to atone for our sin and make the way for His people to be right with God, to bring His sheep safe within the fold.\nYes, I ache when I wander. But I also rejoice when I recognize my Shepherd’s voice. Jesus said, “My sheep hear my voice, I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27). His words ring true. His voice undoes me. What a Good Shepherd, what a Savior!\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nThis past summer, I attended the SING! Conference, hosted by Keith and Kristyn Getty. While there, I heard Joni Eareckson Tada cast a vision for what the resurrection must mean for the physically and mentally disabled. She shared how the first thing she hoped to do in heaven after regaining the use of her legs was to kneel before God. This was because, growing up in church traditions that made space for confessional kneeling, she was not able to participate in this part of the liturgy, although her confidence in God’s goodness was obvious. I believe the resurrection, which means a literal “raising up,” has a secondary layer of beauty for those who cannot raise themselves physically now. \nWhen Martha confesses belief that her brother Lazarus will rise again on the last day, Jesus tells her that He is “the resurrection and the life” (John 11:25). Although Martha already believed in the coming resurrection, she didn’t appear to fully understand that Christ Himself was the embodiment of it. I imagine this is why Jesus explains how those who believe in Him will live on even after death and asks her: “Do you believe this?” (v.26).\nThe idea of Jesus raising her brother from the dead that day was almost too good to be true for Martha. It was a big ask. Her cheeks still wet with tears of grief, she knew that she would see her brother again, but it felt like hoping against hope that Jesus would revive his breath when so many others didn’t get that privilege. Four days in, surely Lazarus was gone (v.17). \nTo Martha, the resurrection at the end of history was a detached concept. It provided her with hope, but only a futuristic hope that barely touched her present grief. Jesus surprised her by bringing her brother back to life with the simple command of “Lazarus, come out!” (v.44).\nOne of my best friends told me once that “Truth is a Man.” It’s always stuck with me. Although, for some, Christianity may just be a system of strung together theological concepts (our human attempt to understand God), the center of the gospel is the person of Jesus Christ—who has skin and bones. Our whole faith history, before and after the incarnation, must now be interpreted through that earth-shattering event. This Man, who is also fully God, has the power to resurrect all things—our physical bodies and hearts and even the empty places that don’t have a name. \nWhether, like Joni Earechson Tada, you’re one of the walking wounded who feel stuck or held back by physical and mental disadvantages, or you simply feel the toll of being human, the hope of the resurrection is that it is here, now—because He is here, now. Because Christ is in us, the same Spirit’s power that raised Him from the dead is in us, too (Romans 8:11). What a crazy and humbling thought that is. \n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\n“What are you looking for?” seems like a harmless question when you’re, say, on all fours looking for the back of an earring in a crowded elevator. Or maybe when your bike has been stolen and you’re filling out a police report detailing its exact size, color, and last known location.\nBut when it comes to something you’ve never had before, like a dream job or a new friend, it can be hard to articulate exactly what you’re hoping to find. What I know for sure is that every time I sit across from an attractive, intelligent man on a first date, I dread them asking, “So… what are you looking for?” What I’ve figured out is that the question beneath the question is actually, “Is it me?” And no… it’s not terrifying or too soon to be asking that question on a first date—nope, not all.\nWhat I find interesting, though, is that this question, this posture of seeking, is ingrained in us. Ever since the fall, humanity has found itself lacking, and thus, we have found ourselves searching for who knows what: Chocolate. Caffeine. Ibuprofen. Adventure. Love. Fulfillment. Belonging. Healing. Our need is not a surprise to us. \nI don’t think that any of God’s children would have been able to specifically ask for who we need as a Savior. Sure, we would’ve been able to come up with characteristics, such as someone who is “forgiving” or “loving” or even someone who is “just” in the way they interact with the world and others. But our minds are unable to understand just how great our need is, let alone the compassion and longing God has for us. He had more in store for us than just fulfilling our needs—He wanted to do so in a way that would teach us about His character, draw us to His love, and keep us in His embrace forever. \nAs His disciples encountered Jesus while feeling their own human needs, they probably had a lot of questions come to mind:\nWhich way is right? What can I believe to be absolutely true? How can I find real life in a fallen world? \nJesus answers our fears with this calming reassurance in the beginning of John 14: “Don’t let your heart be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me” (v.1). He is capable of showing us the way, revealing to us the truth, and giving us life abundantly—and that would have been enough, more than we deserve. But He still wants more for us. He wants us to know Him in relationship. \nI love what Charles Spurgeon has to say about the way Jesus talks to His disciples here: “Thus we notice how they speak to him with a natural, easy familiarity; and he talks to them in full sympathy with their weakness, teaching them little by little as they are able to learn. They ask just such questions as a boy might ask of his father. Often they show their ignorance, but never do they seem timid in his presence, or ashamed to let him see how shallow and hard of understanding they are.”\nJesus knows what we are searching for, even when we don’t have a clue. When we ask, “Where is the path? What is true? How can I find life?”, He will always answer, “It is me.” He alone is “the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6).\n\n",

I stopped in my tracks, as if Jesus were about to stroll around the bend, white robe and hair flowing, to offer me a bear hug. A girl can dream, yes? Minutes later, my eyes landed on a branch dangling in front of me; I was standing beneath a grape arbor canopied with a roof of vines overhead. \nI looked more closely and noticed a tiny leaf, torn almost in two. At the bottom of the leaf, a green vine had wrapped itself in a ball around the torn part, binding the tear and holding the leaf close against itself. I got choked up. For years I suffered with panic disorder while living in New York City, and I’d always describe myself as “untethered,” flailing and fleeting like that torn leaf.\nI ran to gather the rest of my group, to show them this gift of analogy. Our guide, Arie, joined us with bright eyes and zeal, eager for any teachable moment. He shared that the nature of the vine when it touches something, is to begin wrapping itself around it, making them one.\nThat year, I’d been reading Dutch missionary Andrew Murray’s book, Abide in Christ, excavating my soul and learning how this vine-and-branch thing works. My encounter with the little vine that day reminded me of this passage from Murray’s book: “My entire life, I thought my closeness with Jesus was dependent upon me. But Jesus’s love draws us in for one thing: to come into His presence and His rest. That’s it. How many of us could use a little soul rest? And when we do come, the Vine takes the reins from there; He pulls us close and tethers us to Himself.” \nThe greatness doesn’t stop there. This tethering becomes provision, meaning all the nutrients of heaven are offered to us right now, to renew us and bring us back to life. Jesus gives us everything we need in life to push back the darkness (2 Peter 1:3). He is “the true vine” who gently binds us to Himself (John 15:1). He brings forth fruit, grown from the life He’s given us, to then bring nourishment to the world. Jesus does it all. Fruit never comes from our own making—it grows to the measure we let Him grow it in us (v.5). \nWhat a beautiful relief! The old covenant was about what we bring to Him—our annual offering, our covering of sin to become restored with God—but the new covenant is all about what Jesus brings to us. His offering. His blood to cover our sin. His righteousness credited to us, declaring us right with God. May we stop striving today and rest in the grip of the Vine’s loving-kindness.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Erin Davis\n\nAge has taught me that I don’t need a smaller view of my problems—I need a bigger view of God. Few truths comfort me more than the fact that God is infinite. He extends indefinitely in all directions; past and present, before and behind. Though the thought is truly mind boggling, Scripture is clear: He has always been. \nGod has no beginning, no point of origin. There was no “before” Him. There can never be an “after.” No one breathed life into His lungs, and no one can take His life from Him. “He is before all things, and by him all things hold together” (Colossians 1:17). He is both the first and the last (Isaiah 44:6). He is “the Alpha and the Omega… the beginning and the end” (Revelation 22:13). He was and He is, and is He coming again (Revelation 1:4).\nThough God created time, He stands outside of it. Since my finite mind cannot grasp His expanse, I like to think of Him like a paper-towel-roll God. Go ahead, grab the empty paper towel roll from your kitchen counter to see what I mean. Hold it up. Look at it from end to end and consider this: This is God’s view of our lives. \nThe Alpha and Omega existed before us. He will exist long after our earthly days are done. He can effortlessly see our lives from beginning to end, like glancing through a cardboard tube. This means our infinite God stands outside of temporary troubles. There is no heartache that can outlast Him, and no hurt He wasn’t around to see.\nBut as vast and incomprehensible as our Creator God is, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to put on flesh and dwell with us, to die for us, and to save us from sin and death. “He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation… all things have been created through him and for him” (Colossians 1:15–16).\nA bigger view of God turns my heart toward worshiping Him. That worship often boomerangs back as peace within my own heart. Every fear and worry we will face today, every insult and besetting sin—everything is fleeting. The things of this world are already circling the drain. Our lives are just a blip on the timeline of eternity, yet each of us matters to Him, our Creator. God, in contrast, is the end-all-be-all, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. Today we can rest in His goodness and constancy. We can rest in His power and His “bigness,” and that is no small thing.\n\n",

The Good Samaritan. The Pearl of Great Price. You’ve heard the stories, but do you know them in their original context? In this 3-week study of the Parables of Jesus, we will read through many of the well-known—and not so well-known—stories Jesus used to teach hearers, both then and now, about how to live as His followers. Each day we will read parables in their immediate context, focusing on a different category of parables each week. In lieu of reading a devotional response, we will work through a series of questions to understand the meaning of the text and take to heart the “secrets of the kingdom.”\nEditor’s Note: In this Parables study, Jesus Himself is telling us stories—stories He wants us to reflect on and process. Rather than asking our writers to write their own stories about Jesus’ stories, we thought it would serve you and the text better to provide questions to help you dig into the meaning of each day’s parable. If you find a parable or passage particularly confusing, stop and pray. Ask the Lord to reveal Himself to you in His Word, and thank Him that we can know Him without knowing all the answers to our questions.\n//\nWeek 1: Parables about God’s Kingdom\nParables are stories with a point. They are designed to make us think about what is being said, why, where, to whom, and in what context. To get to the heart of Jesus’ parables, we need to pull them apart and take a careful look at the details He gives us. One detail that runs through this week’s selection of parables is that Jesus says they all describe the kingdom of God in some way. As you read through these passages, use the following questions to unpack the stories Jesus tells.\n//\nDay 1 Reading: Matthew 13:1-23, Mark 4:33-34\nQuestions:\n1.

What situation or problem is addressed in today’s particular parable, and what is the outcome of the story?\n3. What is the central point of this parable?\n4.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 4:23-7:29\nCan you think back to a moment when your wrong actions or motivations were exposed? When the dark corners of your heart were revealed, and even you stood surprised at the depth of your flaws?\nI am remembering a time recently when my sin was laid bare. I failed to consider others before myself, and I acted in a way contrary to what I know to be true. It was not all intentional, but it was all me. I felt embarrassed. I felt sad. I felt distraught at my helplessness to rewind the situation and make it better. \nImagine with me a version of this scenario where the one who reveals your wrongdoing also offers the remedy for it. He says to you, “Here is what you’ve done, and here is how it violated God and others. You are deeply flawed. But you are also deeply loved. You are not wholly righteous, but I am. You can not live up to every line of the law, but I have. You are not enough, but I was and I am and I will be—on your behalf. Your life is now hidden in mine.”\nIn the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus’ longest recorded sermon and arguably His most well-known, Jesus holds the lives and religion of His hearers up to the light of God’s law. It is as if He takes a spiritual X-ray of their actions, hearts, motives, and rituals, as well as their pain, longings, confusion, and suffering. Reading this sermon should do the same to ours. \nThe prognosis is bleak: we are broken beyond self-repair. But the remedy is real: Jesus came to fulfill every inch of the law on our behalf. \nMuch to the shock of His listeners, Jesus taught that the kingdom of heaven is utterly unlike our earthly kingdoms. The poor and afflicted—not the powerful and attractive—are called blessed, along with the grieving, the seeking, and the persecuted. The the true measure of a person is not just her action, but her heart. Authentic spirituality is reflected not by how loudly we worship in public, but how earnestly we worship in private. Jesus, in effect, says this: You tout the law even as you break the law, but I alone fulfill the law. I alone am enough. \nBecause of the person and work of Christ, the law gives freedom instead of chains, life instead of despair. Rather than dwelling in condemnation or striving in vain for our own righteousness, a proper view of God’s law directs our gaze to Jesus. Seeing God’s law as both holy and wholly fulfilled in Jesus compels us to live out of Christ’s love for us in all areas of life. \nAs we read the Sermon on the Mount, we will feel the sting of Christ’s rebuke of sin and self. The dark corners of our hearts will be exposed, and we may wince at what we find there. But we will also hear the invitation to new life. There is peace in relying solely on Christ’s perfection and goodness. There is freedom in living our lives on earth as citizens of our truer, everlasting kingdom: the kingdom of God. \nThis is the life we were made for. This is the life that is ours in Jesus.\n\nEditor’s Note: You may notice that today’s reading is longer than the others. On this first day of the study, we are reading the Sermon on the Mount in its entirety. Each weekday that follows will include a smaller section of the sermon to allow for more focused study, along with supplementary passages for broader understanding and deeper engagement. We invite you to read along with us.\n",

    "devo_title": "The Beatitudes",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:1-12, Psalm 69:29-33, Isaiah 61:1-3, 1 Timothy 6:11-16\nLike many of you, I have spent the last week glued to the news about Hurricane Harvey. I live about two hours west of Houston and have been unable to wrap my mind around the devastation.\nI was texting with a Houston friend yesterday, checking in to see how her neighborhood is faring. She and her family are okay, but she knows many who are not. While volunteering at an evacuee shelter, she noticed how exhausted many of the mothers looked. They had been sleeping in large rooms, on cots with multiple kids, babies, and families around. So my friend had the idea to set up a night nursery. She and other volunteers would take the nightshift, watching the small children and babies in one room, so tired moms could sleep in another. \nTaking the night shift means nobody will see her volunteering, except for the babies whose diapers she will be changing, who she’ll sing lullabies to and rock to sleep. It is the opposite of glamorous work, but it is the exact definition of kingdom work. Quiet, unseen, faithful. \nIn theory, I love the Beatitudes. I love the way Jesus turned expectations upside down when describing who would inherit the kingdom of God and how. In practice, however, I live by a different set of attitudes. \nBlessed are the poor in spirit? How about blessed is she who depends on herself for her own needs? She will go far in life, never relying on others.\nBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness? How about blessed is she who hungers and thirsts for more social media followers? She will increase her platform.\nBlessed are the peacemakers? How about blessed is she who is always right in an argument? She will be called “the winner.” \nBlessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake? How about blessed is she who does whatever she can to maintain her comfort? She will be… comfortable. \nWhen I really look at my heart, I find these are my true attitudes, the place from which I live my life. I am individualistic, out for my own glory, trying to save face, and hesitant to step outside my own zone of comfort. \nThere is nothing like seeing your friend step up to take the night shift during a natural disaster to put your own heart in check. It forces me to ask, What am I seeking? My own glory or His? Who am I looking to for approval? Others or the Father?\nJesus entered into our world in an unexpected way. He wore no crown. He had no throne. He simply got to work. He took the night shift. He healed and performed miracles, as the Pharisees looked on and judged. He spoke truth even when His disciples abandoned Him because of it. And He died on a cross as Roman soldiers scoffed at the sign they placed above His head: King of the Jews.\nJesus turned it all upside down—the way we thought the King would come and the way we thought we could secure a seat at His table. \nWe want to be big fancy warriors standing by His side. But His command to us is to fall back in the ranks and tend to those who have fallen. To kneel down low, as He did for us. To take the night shift and “be glad and rejoice, because [our] reward is great in heaven” (Matthew 5:12). We may never receive a medal or a trophy for our work, but we have already received the greatest reward of them all: eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 49:5-6, Luke 14:25-35, John 9:5, Colossians 4:2-6\nSalt and light. Some of us have heard these faith metaphors since childhood, maybe even sung them.\nThis little light of mine,\nI’m gonna let it shine.\n Christ followers are salt and light to the world. Jesus says so. So why not “let it shine” like the song says? If light dispels darkness, shouldn’t we hold it up as high and bright as we know how? \nHide it under a bushel? No!\nI’m gonna let it shine.\n“Let your light shine before others,” Jesus says (Matthew 5:16). But a little while later, in this very same sermon, He instructs believers not to flaunt their faith, as the Pharisees were apt to do. Don’t fast so that other people notice; don’t pray loud so that others will hear, He says (Matthew 6:6, 16-18). How then, are we to understand Jesus’ declaration that we are people who should stand out and lend flavor, simply by nature of following Him?\nTensions like this are not my favorite. I like to know what is expected of me so I can meet those expectations, or at least do my best to fly under the radar when I don’t. But no matter how many times I reread these verses from Matthew 5, I can’t find where Jesus gives a measurement for how much salt is too much, or a guide for how brightly our light should shine. Even worse, I can’t find a list of practical examples of how to be salt and light in my 21st century American life. \nIt sounds silly, but isn’t that too often how we approach Scripture? I confess that I do. I read it looking for me instead of Him. \nThe Sermon on the Mount, like all of Jesus’ teaching, offers more than a moral checklist. Jesus addresses the heart behind our action, the motivation behind our direction. His is not a get-it-right gospel of personal achievement, not a formula to memorize. It is relationship. The how-tos are not there because they are not the point: Jesus is the point.\nSaltiness and brightness are not qualities that salt and light determine about themselves. They are qualities determined by their Maker. Their purpose is placed within them, not one they muster up. Likewise, being “the salt of the earth” and “the light of the world” is not something we accomplish by sheer will; it is who we are when we are made new in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). \n“I will also make you a light for the nations,\nto be my salvation to the ends of the earth.”\n– Isaiah 49:6\nIn the same way that salt changes the taste of a meal, or light alters the composition of a room, our redeemed lives in Christ are a way that God, in His good providence, chooses to affect the world around us. We are walking, talking testaments of God’s mercy and grace in a dying world. We are salt and light because He makes us so.\nThe art of living and loving in a way that stands out in a fallen world is a matter of knowing and following Jesus. When we are in relationship with Him, the light we shine is His light. The flavor we bring to the world around us tastes distinctly like the hope and joy of His gospel. \nAs we read Christ’s words today, may we be drawn less to grand feats of faith and more to the everyday outflow of a life lived in prayer, Scripture, repentance, and obedience to the Lord. May we embrace “the mystery of Christ” that Paul spoke to the Colossians (4:3), and seek Him out in the tensions of our faith. After all, following Jesus is more art, less science. It’s not about following rules; it’s about following Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:17-20, Psalm 40:6-8, Hosea 6:6, Micah 6:8, Matthew 11:28-30, John 14:23-26\nWhen I was sixteen, I was not the sixteen of the movies. I expected that I would go to lots of parties and laugh with lots of boys. Instead, I did Bible quizzing. Do you know what this is? It’s amazing and intense. You basically memorize a book of the Bible and then meet up with other church kids and answer questions. There were even special seats that could sense when you stood up, since we were so quick to answer and the human eye could never have accurately detected who was the first up to “Complete the following verse: ‘Do not think that I have come to abolish…’”\nIn a flash I was up, “ThelawortheProphetsIhavenotcometoabolishthembuttofulfillthem!!!”\nThe year I quizzed, we memorized the book of Matthew. I was “Captain Bible Quizzing Nerd Pants.” I wish I had the motivation to memorize Scripture with the tenacity I did when I was sixteen. Back then I threw all my teenage energy into bookish and nerdy pursuits.\nThis is why the book of Matthew rings with the fervor of sixteen-year-old adrenaline for me. The whole book seemed SO IMPORTANT back then. This passage reminds me that the whole of Scripture is important: not just the parts we obsessed over as teenagers, not just the parts we like, and not just the racy bits in Song of Solomon.\nChrist fulfills the whole of Scripture. \nSome Jews, weary under the weight of the law, might have wished that Christ would totally abolish it. They, like me, might have wished they could just be free of the law to live as they liked. But the law of the Old Testament provides boundaries and a structure upon which to hang the grace Christ offers in the New Testament. \nImagine a playground high on a mountain. Now, try to stay calm, watching the kids climbing and swinging from up above. I know I would keep all my babies as close as possible, not letting them run because of my fear they would fall. Now imagine this mountain playground is surrounded by a sturdy fence. Suddenly there is freedom to play! The boundary gives freedom.\nThis is what Christ is saying: the law is excellent, and He fulfills it. If the law is a glass of water, Christ doesn’t pour it out, He fills it up for us. He doesn’t make the law void; He stamps it paid in full!\nOn the other hand, the Jews believed that anything belonging to God should be preserved—even the least of the commandments, which incidentally, they reckoned was found in Deuteronomy 22:6-7: If you find a bird’s nest, you can take the baby birds, but leave the mother bird (my paraphrase). These jots and tittles—they were the bread and butter of the Pharisees, the Super Law Followers. \nBut Christ does something truly amazing. He calls us to repent of both our sins AND our righteousness. Our “goodness” is not good enough, our righteousness is not righteous enough. Only Christ’s redemption is enough. The Pharisees obeyed the outside of the law, but we are called to obey the inside of the law, the truth, heart, and substance behind it. So go ahead and pay your tithe, but give God your heart.\nIt’s only when we realize that even our righteousness isn’t enough, that we can repent and trust ourselves to the righteousness of Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Murder Begins in the Heart",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:21-26, Genesis 4:1-16, Exodus 20:13, Psalm 14:1-3, Mark 11:23-25, James 2:8-13, 3:3-6\nGrowing up with two brothers meant a constant war of the wills. I wanted to watch Harriet the Spy and they wanted to watch Star Wars. I wanted to do crafts, and they wanted to play video games. It was the usual sibling conflict, but it provided our parents with many teachable moments. \nI still remember the awkwardness of learning to apologize. We would mutter “sorry” under our breath, but that didn’t cut it. Our parents would prompt us to say why we were sorry and then ask us to hug one another, no matter how forced it seemed. \nYou’d think all that practice at reconciliation would make it easier, but the truth is my first instinct is still to avoid conflict. I would much rather ignore the tension in my relationships and hope it disappears. So when I read Jesus’ words in the Gospel of Matthew, clearly stating we need to address and heal the grievances in our relationships if we are going to be in right relationship with God, I start to sweat a little. \nIn Matthew 5:21-26, we read the first of six discourses found in the Sermon on the Mount. Each begins with Jesus saying, “You have heard that it was said… But I tell you…” These six discourses are heavy hitters. Jesus greatly raised the bar of expectation on how His followers are meant to behave in regard to anger, purity, divorce, honesty, generosity, and love. Christ was showing that God requires righteousness that surpassed even that of the scribes and Pharisees. Who can possibly live up to this standard? No person other than Jesus Christ, of course. And so Jesus calls us to aim higher, but also to realize our need for His mercy and grace.\nThe new teaching Christ gave on murder said that even anger in the heart would be subject to judgment. While most of us can’t imagine committing murder, who hasn’t been angry or unkind toward another? In realizing that any hate in our heart is worthy of punishment, we can’t stand above the law and pretend we don’t need saving.\nWhat seems especially important in this passage is Christ’s command to get right with our brothers and sisters before we make our offering to the Lord. So often we want to ask God for forgiveness and leave it at that. But the Lord cares deeply about our broken relationships here on earth. Just as parents teach their children to apologize to siblings, our heavenly Father teaches us, His children, to reconcile with our brothers and sisters in Christ. \nWe are meant to be the family of God to one another, and being a healthy family means lovingly facing the pain, tension, and hurt encountered in true relationship. \nIt is the work of the Holy Spirit to reveal to us if “[our] brother or sister has something against [us].” (Perhaps you are thinking of someone now?) We are called to listen to this prompting and “go and be reconciled” as much as we are able. Some relationships may seem impossible to repair, but the Lord calls us to do our best to reconcile. Whether or not our attempts are accepted is not in our control.\nHowever difficult or broken our earthly relationships may be, we have the peace and presence of Jesus, just as He promised (John 14:26-27). He pursued us at our worst and gave His life so that we might experience the ultimate reconciliation—peace with God.\n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:27-30, Exodus 20:14,17, Psalm 19:12-14, Jeremiah 17:9, Mark 9:43-48\nI became a Pharisee the day I dropped my phone in the toilet.\nI didn’t mean to, of course. Months prior, I’d signed my life away with paperwork acknowledging that water damage would not, under any circumstances, be covered by a protection plan. I happily checked the box, certain I would not, under any circumstances, be one of those people—the careless kind.\nBut I was. Suddenly, I wasn’t just dipping my toes in the idea of being that kind of person, I was nose-diving into full-fledged, card-carrying membership. To make matters worse, I kept it all a secret, appearing at the mobile phone help desk and looking like a victimized puppy. “What? Water? Never!” I gasped.\nAnd then they brought out the lie detector. Well, it was technically a test for water damage, but in this case, it was a ruthless, truth-gauging machine and I was forced to plead guilty.\nI didn’t ever think I’d be guilty of adultery, either. After all, I’m just a single twenty-something girl who blushed the whole way through this passage. I grew up in the church, envisioning this commandment from Jesus as the free space on my Salvation Bingo card.\nBut, like the Pharisees, I’m prone to forget that the thing God cares about most is our hearts. We don’t have to cheat on a romantic relationship to prove ourselves unfaithful to a faithful God. Sin is just another name for adultery of the heart, which means that most of the bad things we thought we’d never do, we’ve already done. We’re guilty. We’re those people.\nMatthew Henry points out that this passage not only forbids the act of adultery, but also the appetite for it and approach to it. He says “convenient opportunity” is the only difference between thinking about eating the forbidden fruit and actually eating it.\nSo, what are we supposed to do? Do we hide away from the world? How do we just stop sinning?\nThe heart is more deceitful than anything else,\nand incurable—who can understand it?\n– Jeremiah 17:9\nAt first glance, the answer we find in God’s Word may seem pretty disturbing. Mark 9 instructs us to cut off our hands and feet and gouge out our eyes when we even begin to think about sin. While it’s gross and painful to think about, Jesus uses this illustration not to punish us, but to show us the depth of sin we’ve been rescued from. He wants us to see that the life He calls us to live is actually impossible to achieve solely by our flesh. His rescue is not a convenience; it is a necessity. Saving our souls should have lost us everything else, but instead, we gain Him. \nWith this as Jesus’ standard, we can look to His covenant bride, the Church, with awe and admiration, knowing it has never even crossed His mind to leave her—to leave us. He loves us. He truly loves us.\nAll of the good things we knew we could not do, He’s already done. Praise the Lord.\n May the words of my mouth\nand the meditation of my heart\nbe acceptable to you,\nLord, my rock and my Redeemer.\n– Psalm 19:14\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:31-32, Genesis 2:20-25, Malachi 2:10-16, Matthew 19:1-12, 1 Corinthians 7:10-16\nLast night, my husband and I held hands as guests at a wedding. Outdoor summer weddings in the South are the epitome of idealistic thinking. As I enthusiastically fanned us both with a pink fan glued to a wooden stick, I thought about how ridiculous it was for us to be casually, affectionately holding hands at a time like this. Watching the fresh, glorious young bride and her awestruck groom make their vows in earnest to one another, I couldn’t help but think how the whole thing is just completely impossible. \nWe fall in love, and that love leads us to make wildly extravagant promises to each other. We promise, in our best clothes and in front of all our aunts and uncles, to “love, honor, and obey as long as we both shall live.” It is the bravest, most ridiculous promise I’ve ever made.\nHave I kept my wedding vows? Have you? Truly? Even before we drove off into the sunset I had broken my vows. My heart was full of love, but my soul was still inclined to offer my new husband selfishness and dishonor. We make extravagant promises we cannot keep, but that’s why marriage is a covenant we make first with God, and then with each other. God keeps His promises. He created marriage and designed it to last.\nI love marriage. I want to go even further than the Pharisees and say that “what God has joined together, let no man separate” (Matthew 19:6). I want no one to ever get divorced. But this is exactly what the Sermon on the Mount is all about. It’s rubber-meets-the road Christianity. And when the rubber meets the road, sometimes people have to get divorced. When the Pharisees ask about the conditions for divorce, they are, as per usual, trying to see how high they can draw the water line to measure who was right and who was wrong. And Jesus gives them “sexual immorality” as the only possible grounds.\nBut the grounds for marriage and the grounds for divorce aren’t to be our chief focus here. Christ Himself is the center of our covenant vows. When the Apostle Paul speaks of marriage, he says, “I am speaking of Christ and the church” (Ephesians 5:32). This means that marriage doesn’t exist apart from Christ. To ignore Christ in any consideration, either of marriage or divorce, is peril and destruction. Whether sin bears its ugly fruit in divorce, or grace intervenes to reconcile, these things must all be laid at the feet of Christ the faithful.\nWhether it’s our parents, our siblings, our friends, or our own marriage—divorce has touched all of us in some way. The truth is, marriage doesn’t always work out. Even Moses made provision for divorce (Matthew 19:8). But when the Pharisees asked Jesus about divorce, they were thinking of marriage in strictly human terms; therefore, they also thought of divorce in merely pragmatic, human terms.\nThe things we think about at a wedding are exactly the things we should think about at a divorce. Yes, the world is a broken place, and we are broken people. But our brokenness is not the final standard for marriage or divorce. The extravagant promises of a wedding day are secured for us, not in our own strength, but in Christ. Both the making and the keeping of vows are only possible by His sustaining grace. And, knowing His faithfulness, we can have confidence, despite our folly.\nAnd that’s why we keep engaging in this impossible mystery of marriage. God made us for love. He gave us marriage to make us holy, and to teach us about Himself. And that’s why we keep doing crazy things like getting married outdoors in the south in the summer. \nMarriage isn’t about us. It’s about Him. He is the one who keeps vows.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:33-37, Exodus 20:7, Ecclesiastes 5:4-7, Matthew 26:62-64, James 5:12\nI should be walking around with a needle in my eye. Maybe you should too. \nThat visual might make us cringe, but a touch of squeamishness is just what we need to really hear Jesus’ words recorded in Matthew 5:33-37. Sandwiched in the middle of hard-to-digest teachings on divorce and loving our enemies, Jesus calls out our long track record of broken promises. \n“Cross my heart. Hope to die. Stick a needle in my eye.” Remember saying that as a kid? As we vowed to be BFFs with our playmates or to tell the truth in a given situation, we may have crossed our hearts with our little fingers, but we didn’t really hope to die. We certainly didn’t expect someone to stick a needle in our eye if the promise was forgotten or broken. \nWith all of the conviction our hearts could muster, we made a vow we couldn’t keep. It’s a habit we likely haven’t grown out of entirely, and one that is not new to Christ’s followers. The practical takeaway of this mini-sermon on vows is simple, though certainly not easy. I can’t say it better than Christ, so I won’t attempt to. \n“But let your ‘yes’ mean ‘yes,’ and your ‘no’ mean ‘no.’ Anything more than this is from the evil one.”\n– Matthew 5:37\nIn a world where words are cheap and promises are disposable, we are called to be promise keepers, a people who faithfully follow through. If we say we will do something, we ought to show up and do it. If we aren’t sure we can, we should ask the Holy Spirit to help us decline or stay quiet. \nThere are a zillion practical applications of this truth, but just using these words as a guide to manage our calendars and commitments is the lower-hanging, easy-to-pick fruit. Let’s look up and see the gospel. \nThe Old Testament is packed with followers who made dramatic vows to the Lord:\n\nJacob vowed to worship Yahweh and tithe a tenth of his belongings if God would meet his physical needs (Genesis 28:20-22).\n\nSamson’s parents made a vow on his behalf, promising to never cut his hair (Judges 13:5).\n\nHannah vowed to send her firstborn son to live in the temple if God would give her the baby she longed for (1 Samuel 1:10-11).\n\nJonah attempted to use a vow to pry open the mouth of the huge fish that swallowed him (Jonah 2:9).\n\nDavid vowed not to sleep until he built a temple for the ark of the covenant (Psalm 132:2-5).\n\n\nThe people on this list kept their promises imperfectly or not at all, just like we do. They may have followed through on one specific vow, but each of them failed at keeping their promise to worship God alone and to obey Him perfectly. We’ve followed suit by promising to love, serve, worship, and obey out of one corner of our mouths, while sinning out of the other corner. But we should not get used to this. Breaking promises to God, and to others, should always make us squirm. Even more, it should cause us to repent and look to Jesus.\nOur imperfections highlight and point to Christ’s perfection. He is the ultimate and only promise keeper. Despite our trail of broken promises, God has not reneged on His promise to save us and free us from sin, to bring us back into relationship with Him. This is the gospel, isn’t it? \nWe can say what we mean and mean what we say because we bear His image. More importantly we can be constantly buoyed by the hope that God will keep every promise He’s ever made to us.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:38-42, Exodus 21:23-25, Exodus 22:26-27, Romans 13:1-4, 1 Peter 2:21-23\nYou’ve probably felt like a doormat at times. I have too. Worn out, overlooked, stepped on, stepped over, left outside, dirtied, and eventually discarded. I’ve felt it in friendships and in family and in my own home. I’ve felt it in conversations and invitations and misinterpretations. I’ve felt it in my own heart and had it confirmed by others when they didn’t know I could hear. \nMy temptation is to stand straighter, hold my head higher, and if I’m honest, to sometimes do it right back. Forget to invite. Overlook. Walk past. Not consider. I want to give like in return for like, an eye for an eye, as Jesus said was the norm in Matthew 5:38. This is a human reaction to a human condition; we’re all trading eyes without ever really seeing anything at all. But Jesus wanted to show us another way: \n“If anyone slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. As for the one who wants to sue you and take away your shirt, let him have your coat as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two. Give to the one who asks you, and don’t turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you” (Matthew 5:39-42).\nIn other words, don’t trade eyes for eyes, giving like for like; instead, take the exchange out entirely: Give and turn, then let go. Jesus is essentially telling us to turn our palms up, shoulder the weight we’re not meant to carry, and walk on, going with them for an extra mile. We ought to out-give, out-do, out-serve, and in doing so, bring honor and glory to Him. \nWe’ve all felt like the doormat, felt the rub of dirty feet across our backs, a by-way for others to step over in their entrance to the feast. But then I think of sweet Jesus, lifting the feet of the disciples—dirty, sore, broken, smelly feet—and washing them with His own hands. The Savior of the world holding the feet of users and walkers and blind men who thought they could see, and washing them, making them clean. \nWe are not the Savior. We cannot make clean what is unclean, but we can turn our cheeks, anticipating the sting of a broken person’s hand. We can anticipate the swindler, coming to take us for all we’re worth, and give them everything, saying our worth is wrapped up in Christ and not what we own. We can walk not one mile, but two, knowing it takes longer than a mile to long-suffer with someone, finding in the second mile that we are no longer enemies, but friends. And we can give instead of withhold, forgive instead of demanding repayment. \nI know the world may see us as doormats still—used, reused, walked over, and forgotten. But with our eyes fixed on Jesus, rather than on judging others, we will see something far better and more glorious than revenge: Christ, who became nothing, obedient to death, even death on a cross, so that we might walk miles and miles and miles with Him, both in this life and in the next.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:43-48, Leviticus 19:18, Deuteronomy 6:5, Matthew 22:34-40, Luke 6:36, Romans 12:9-21, 1 John 3:18\nIf you don’t have an enemy, you’ve probably never lived in the South during football season. When you declare devotion to a specific team or conference—or in my case, if this affection is delicately handed to you by a long, never-to-be broken-or-else lineage of family fans—you inherit the cheers, the players, the colors, the mascot, and of course, the rivals. You cannot root for one team without rooting against another.\nAlthough I did not choose the college my family cheers for, I did choose to root against their rival school, so I could still show up to Thanksgiving dinner without remorse. When it was time for my brother to choose a college, however, he asked me to sit down and brace myself for bad news. Using a poster board and pre-written speech, he told me something I never thought I’d hear from my own flesh and blood: he had chosen to attend our family’s rival school. He had chosen to become my enemy. Suddenly, game days consisted of watching the game in separate rooms and raising a flag above our childhood home which read, “House Divided.”\nOther than the fun and games of college football, I try really hard to be liked, and therefore, don’t have many “enemies.” And since I can’t name them, I don’t have to worry about loving them, right? But Jesus doesn’t ask us whether or not we have enemies. He does not give us qualifiers like, “If you have enemies… ” or “During football season…” Rather, He assumes we do have enemies and tells us to love them. \nWhat if our reluctance to admit to having enemies is standing in the way of God working through us to bring Him glory? What if our “goodness” and pride are blocking the flow of His true goodness in our relationships? We must stop avoiding the fact that we have enemies and get to the hard, kingdom-building work of loving them.\nIn Matthew 5:43-48, Jesus clarifies a way of following Him that goes above and beyond the law:\n“You have heard that it was said, Love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven.”\n– Matthew 5:43-45\nGulp. Okay, so maybe I have a few enemies—and not just of the sports variety. But loving my enemies in my own strength looks like the half-hearted lineup at the end of a football field, exchanging handshakes and “good games,” then ducking out to head for the locker room.\nBut loving people the way Jesus taught means praying for them, and prayer requires more than a half-hearted intention. Prayer requires truly wanting good for someone else. Because Jesus did not settle for anything less than redemption in His love for us, we must do the same for each other. \nI don’t think the point is to love our enemies until they stop being our enemies; I think it’s to experience God doling out grace in equal proportion alongside them in community. This serves as a reminder that if it weren’t for Jesus, we would all be eternal enemies of His and of one another.\nThere is no reason to keep score in our relationships. The Victor has already won. This means we no longer count someone else’s gain our loss, or vice versa, because Jesus is ours, and He is all we’ll ever need. \nPraise the Lord, our constant companion, for His love. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:1-4, Proverbs 24:12, 1 Corinthians 13:1-3, 2 Thessalonians 1:5-10, 1 John 2:28-29\nIn the 1960s, an innovative surgeon began work on a procedure that would separate the right and left hemispheres of the brain in order to stop seizures in patients with epilepsy. They called it the “split brain” surgery. It was a desperate measure—a last resort. The idea was to keep seizures originating on one side of the brain from spreading to the other side. \nBut cutting one side of the brain off from the other had some powerful and strange side effects, like one side of the body working independently of the other, not necessarily responsive to the will of the person inhabiting it. Instead of working as a seamless whole, it was as if one side didn’t know the other.\nI wonder if this violence to the brain is the only way for the left hand not to know what the right hand is doing. My left and right hands are best friends. When righty donates money to a good cause, lefty is already standing by for the high five. In Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, He is showing us what it really looks like to be a Christian. And when it comes to our own righteousness, He makes it clear that both hands, intertwined, are guilty of selfishness.\nEven more than we love to know others, we love to be known. We go to great lengths to make sure people know us, or at least know our good side. This is the problem Jesus was getting at in today’s passage: Have any of us have ever acted purely for the sake of others, with no thought of our own reputation? It’s a terrible thought, when you really parce out your motivation for one specific good action.\nPerhaps at our best moments, we have forgotten ourselves, given of ourselves freely, asked nothing in return. But if your heart is like mine, I can still recollect these moments of selfless triumph and try to cash them in for glory after the fact. Even at our best, we act from mixed motives. If we don’t get at least a little recognition, a simple thank you, or a smile in return, we feel slighted. But Jesus says that if we’re getting applause from others, then we already have our reward. He cautions us to humbly give in secret—so much so, that our left hand won’t have any idea what the right hand is doing (Matthew 6:1-3).\nThere’s no tally sheet. Our good deeds won’t be weighed against our bad deeds on a shining celestial scale because there’s no scale. There is only Jesus Christ, who writes our names in the book of life (Revelation 20:15; Luke 10:20). The ledger is stamped with Christ’s name, and when my life is counted, His righteousness is the only thing in view.\nThis can easily tempt me to clasp my hands behind my head, lean back, accept His grace, and give up worrying about good or bad actions all together. But both extremes of law and grace miss the mark. God is love, and He has filled us up with His love; therefore, our response is now to love in turn. We do good things because it is the only sane response to all the love that has been given to us. We do good things because our hearts are delighted by our heavenly Father. We do good things because we have learned to rejoice in giving rather than getting.\nLet your right and your left hand work with diligence at doing what is good and right. Rest in the safety of His atoning love. Pour out the love that He has given you to others, because God is love, and there will always be more.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:5-8, 2 Kings 4:32-37, Isaiah 26:20, Matthew 26:36-46, Mark 1:35-38, Luke 18:9-14\nMy copy of C.S. Lewis’ The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe smells like hot asphalt and recess kickball. With grass stains and dog-eared pages, the book was on my third grade required reading list, but my time spent feasting on the adventures of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy was anything but forced. I spent every moment I could nose-deep in its chapters, only looking up from the playground outfield if my name was called out (at least twice), or if my face was hit with a ball (just once).\nThe most tattered and beloved pages of that book are in the beginning chapters—before the lion or the witch are even introduced. It’s the wardrobe that got me. Lucy, the youngest, is the first to wander into her uncle’s neglected spare room and open the wardrobe doors, finding the forest dreamland of Narnia just beyond them. One of my favorite lines is easy to miss, because it’s just before she steps foot into the newly discovered world:\n“She did not shut [the wardrobe door] properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.”\nWe are hesitant to close the door on the world we love, even when an even better one awaits us. Even the most adventurous child is hesitant to explore in secret. But in teaching us how to pray, Jesus says to “go into your private room, shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret” (Matthew 6:6). He instructs us to approach the Lord from a secret place, unlike the hypocrites who stand on the street corners yelling for their Father. Isaac left for a field, Christ retreated to a mountain, Peter went to a rooftop.\nWhile this is a great warning against hypocrisy, these actions point us more toward the realm we enter into with prayer than the world we leave behind when we retreat—and it’s way better than Narnia. Prayer is the place where we do our most God-honoring work. Alone with Christ is where we remember that we can trust in Him alone.\nIt’s not that our Father doesn’t want others to know we’re talking to Him; it’s that He wants us to know who He is apart from others and the distractions of this world. We must intentionally and physically practice that truth that He is always near—we are never alone. If we don’t make a point to to “go away” from the world and pray, we will miss this. If Lucy had stood outside the wardrobe speculating about the possibility of Narnia, she and her siblings would have been left, as the book describes, “always in winter but never Christmas.”\nThe world is loud and familiar, but it does not see us and know us the way Jesus does. He is better, and He waits to meet with us in the secret places of our hearts that are not secret to Him. \nHeavenly Father, we confess it is difficult to close the door to a noisy world. But You alone know and offer what we really need. Teach us how to pray when we don’t know where to start. Help us to form words that are vulnerable and true, for they bring You glory. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:9-15, Proverbs 30:8, Luke 11:2-4, James 1:13-15, 1 Peter 1:3-9\nIf we stacked the books, commentaries, and sermons that have been written about the Lord’s Prayer together, we might be able to build a bridge long enough to get us to the hillside where Christ first taught us how to pray. Our fascination with this segment of the Sermon on the Mount seems surprisingly obvious: \nWe don’t know how to pray. \nI’ve been a follower of Christ for more than two decades. By God’s grace, I’ve grown leaps and bounds in my understanding of His Word and my grasp of my role in the Body of Christ. But when it comes to prayer, I still get the feeling that I’m somehow doing it wrong. Turns out, I’m in good company.  \nIt was after the Sermon on the Mount that the disciples begged, “Lord, teach us to pray” (Luke 11:1). Jesus patiently repeated the model He’d already given them. Even if we’ve read, meditated on, and listened to commentary about the Lord’s Prayer a zillion times, Jesus’ words remain worth considering. (Take a moment to look at them again now in Matthew 6:9-13.) When my own prayers feel clunky or inefficient, these words of Jesus’ jog my memory about a few things. \nFirst, prayer is not solely about me and my desires. It is first and foremost about God and His glory. If we rewind the Sermon on the Mount tapes just a smidge, we see that before Jesus taught us how to pray, He taught us how not to. He warned us not to pray fancy words in the hopes of being applauded by an audience of onlookers (Matthew 6:1-6). Prayer is not a tool we can use to bend the spotlight toward ourselves. Instead, Jesus’ model prayer opens with a list of “yours” that focus on the Father: \nHallowed be your name.\nYour kingdom come.\nYour will be done.\nMy prayers get off course because too often my heart is postured to think about my reputation, my little kingdom, and how I can convince God that my will needs to be done. But those things don’t get kicked to the curb entirely. The second half of the Lord’s prayer pivots to “us” beautifully. \nGive us this day our daily bread.\nForgive us our debts.\nLead us not into temptation.\nDeliver us from evil.\nOf the seven petitions given in the Lord’s Prayer, three are about God and four are about us. It’s the order of importance that is worth noting. God first, us second. It’s a pattern we should imitate in how we live, love, and pray. \nGoing over the Lord’s Prayer with a fine-toothed comb also reminds me that it’s okay to pray God’s words right back to Him. Many of Jesus’ words in the Lord’s Prayer nod to Old Testament passages and concepts (see 2 Chronicles 20:6; Proverbs 30:8; Psalm 71:4). Surely if the Word became flesh and quoted Himself, we can quote Him too. \nSince prayer is a conversation of the heart, the goal is not rote memorization. Isn’t it possible to say the same things over and over and still mean them deeply? I told my husband and children I loved them this morning at the breakfast table. It’s the same script I’ve been reading for years, and I mean it now more than ever. When we don’t know how to pray, we can pray God’s Word, confident it never loses an ounce of its power.\nFrom listeners on a hillside, to His disciples, to us, God invites us to lay down pretenses and performance and boldly approach Him through prayer. Lord, teach us to pray? Friends, He already has.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:16-18, 2 Samuel 12:15-23, Psalm 51:16-17, Isaiah 58:1-12, Revelation 19:6-10\nOne of my pet peeves is when people in public talk really loudly on purpose. Don’t get me wrong, I like loud and extroverted people in general, but the random strangers who want to be overheard irk me. Have you ever noticed someone talking about their awesome adventures, juicy gossip, or busy schedule, and it feels like they want you to hear every word? To know how cool or important they are? As I write this I’m sitting in a coffee shop next to a mighty loud cell phone talker. Deep breaths.\nIn my work as a counselor, I’ve learned about a common human defense called “projecting.” Projecting is essentially when you don’t want to face your own weakness, and so you deny your problems while seeing and disliking them in other people. Pet peeves are often projections. To be honest, I have on occasion noticed myself starting to talk extra loud in public and I hate it. That’s probably why it really bugs me so much in other people, because I’ve felt my own shallow desire to be admired and I’m not proud of that. \nThe truth is, most people deeply crave admiration and recognition from others. We want someone to tell us we are cool, perfect, strong, holy, or worthy. Jesus addressed this condition of the human heart in the book of Matthew, when He instructed His followers on how to fast. \nWhen Jesus spoke about fasting it was a common practice for Jewish people, but had become quite a show for some. This practice which is meant to humble people before the Lord, instead made them proud in their own self-righteousness. The fasting people made their deeds obvious to all around them by looking visibly disheveled and afflicted. Like the person talking loudly in the coffee shop, they wanted others to notice and affirm their value. \nTo the religious people fasting for human recognition, Jesus said, “You have received your reward.” Meaning, “You want human admiration so badly? Then enjoy it. But I know your heart, and you’re not doing this for me.” You see Christ told His followers to hide their fasting because He wanted to keep their intentions pure and their faces turned toward God alone, so they might find their worth and identity in Him.\nGod is always concerned with our heart than our sacrifices, and He shows that throughout the Sermon on the Mount. The Lord already knows the motives of our hearts and minds (Jeremiah 17:10)—the good, the bad, and the ugly. There is no sense in putting on a show, and there is no need either, because the Lord is “gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in faithful love” (Psalm 145:8-9). \nChrist gave us commands and practices to connect with us, not to put us under another law. As Paul proclaimed in Galatians, “For freedom, Christ set us free. Stand firm then and don’t submit again to a yoke of slavery” (Galatians 5:1). Sometimes that yoke of slavery looks like an insatiable need to have others admire you. But the Lord knows that a true sense of your value can only be found in Him, and so He wants to free you from that devastating rabbit chase.  \nWhatever works you are doing for the Lord, make Him your audience of one. And “your father who sees in secret will reward you.” \n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:19-24, Proverbs 28:22, Luke 12:13-21, Ephesians 5:5, 1 Timothy 6:17-19\nLook around you and consider this: it will all make a good bonfire some day. \nSomewhere along the line, that little catchphrase got filed in my heart. I find it equal parts jarring and comforting. Jarring because so much of what I’ve spent my life building is destined to pass away. Comforting because I have assurance that the laundry that needs folding and the bills that need to be paid and the floors that need mopping won’t be going with me into eternity. (Amen!) \nJesus is not anti-treasure. He’s the one who buried diamonds in the caves of Africa and gold in the mountains of Colorado. He also buried a craving for treasure deep inside our hearts. He wants us to be treasure hunters. But the kind of treasure we’re hunting matters. Here, Jesus helps us see that all that shines and glitters must be lumped into one of two categories. Only two. There is no third option. \n“Don’t store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal” (Matthew 6:19). \nCategory number one is perishable treasure. Anything you’ve ever bought or built with your own two hands is perishable. Your home, your car, your 401K? Perishable, perishable, perishable. Your wardrobe, your appearance, your accolades and attagirls? Those are all perishable too. So much of our lives is destined to make a good bonfire some day. As we picture the ashes, we are tempted to wonder, What’s left?\nAnswer: the imperishable. \n“But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves don’t break in and steal” (v. 20).\nWhat are these heavenly treasures? God’s Word points us to three things that will last forever: the Word of God (Isaiah 40:8), the people of God (John 3:16), and the kingdom of God (Psalm 45:6). Every penny, every second we invest in these things is untouchable, locked away in a heavenly vault. It cannot rot or rust. It cannot be stolen. It can never be taken away. \nJesus spoke about money and possessions often, but He never branded them as evil, just perishable. As we keep listening to the Sermon on the Mount we see the real reason we need these frequent reminders. \n“For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also” (v. 21). \nYou see, it’s not the treasure Christ is concerned about; it’s our hearts. He knows that worshiping our possessions will destroy us (v. 24). Our hearts will begin to rot long before our belongings do. He warns us to “take care and be on [our] guard against all covetousness” (Luke 12:15), not because He is worried we might amass too much treasure. We can’t begin to acquire enough riches to match His. He simply knows the moment is coming when our possessions will go up in smoke. We can buy insurance for our stuff, but Jesus is offering us insurance for our hearts. \nGo ahead and buy the new dress you found on sale. Pick out new granite countertops. Keep folding that endless pile of laundry, but know that a day is coming when God will stack all of our belongings together for kindling and strike a match (2 Peter 3:10). As we watch our earthly treasure turn to ashes, may we celebrate our investment in the riches that can never be taken from us.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:25-34, Psalm 147:7-11, Philippians 4:4-7, 1 Peter 5:6-11\nIt rained hard today, soaking into the summer skin of Texas, the red dirt and rolling hills. I’ve been saying for days I needed to water the Blue Salvias, even though they’re drought-resistant. They are drooping and limp. I brushed past them yesterday and saw small blue bits floating down as I did. It is easy to believe I alone am their savior, their maker. That I must breathe life into them, coddle them into adulthood, water them in the evening, and watch them at noonday when the sun is highest and hottest. But it rained hard today, and their soil is moist and wet, and their leaves shimmer with droplets clinging in earnest. They know they need the water. And they know their true Maker gives what they need.\nIn our home we have a saying: We must be faithful to the Word of God and not to an outcome. This is our way of encapsulating what Jesus said in Matthew 6: \n“So don’t worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you. Therefore don’t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own” (vv. 31-34).\nJesus was essentially saying that, in seeking first the kingdom, things will work out—not necessarily according to our plans, but according to His. When our attention and affection are rightly placed on God, we find that while He might not always give us what we want, He always gives us what we need. \nI caught myself in worry this past week, noting it because I am not normally a worrier. I plan, I think, I process, I pray, but rarely do I worry. I know nothing can be added to my life by worrying, but sometimes I think everything will be added to my life by planning, thinking, processing, and even praying. I think I am magician and maker and manipulator, and if I do it all well, I will add to my life and flourish. \nBut in doing so, I am deeply deceived. Nothing is added to my life by worrying or spending time fretting about how I think things ought to go. In the end, what is taken from my life is the time I spent on something other than faithfully seeking the kingdom of God. \nGod provides what we need, and if we don’t have it, we don’t need it. This is a hard thing to believe and an even harder thing to live out. We are prone to inventing needs: new couches and new houses, new cars, phones, bodies, and attitudes. It’s no wonder we’re also prone to worrying when those perceived needs are not met. We, like the flowers in my gardens, may droop, and we may wilt a little, we may suffer. But “after [we] have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called [us ] to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish [us]” (I Peter 5:10).\nToday, the God of all grace has given you all the graces you need because He cares for you. He will Himself restore you, confirm you, strengthen you, and establish you—for His sake and your good.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:1-6, Matthew 13:44-46, Romans 2:1-11, 1 Corinthians 4:1-5, James 5:7-11\nWe keep all the candy in a basket in the pantry. The leftover Halloween chocolates, the Easter jelly beans, gourmet candy canes from Christmas, and the Valentine hearts—they all end up in our candy basket. A whole year’s worth of sweets for five children. It’s quite a haul. Some years we just forget about it until it degrades, and I throw it away. Once we pulled it all out and decorated our most extravagantly baroque gingerbread house ever. This year, since the kids are a little older, I’ve been pulling out treats and doling them out for occasional sugar-joy.\nSince I don’t trust them to make responsible sugar choices, the kids aren’t allowed to get into the candy themselves. But I am. And I do. Not all of it tempts me. I could go the rest of my life without sour or hard candies. But there are some very grown-up chocolates and cookies that sing a sticky-gooey siren song. It floats out from under the door of the pantry, calling to me. I sneak in and steal a snack. Now, if one of my tender babes stole a treat, I would come down hard on them. I’d start by taking away the candy, then lecturing on the dangers of stealing, followed by the risks of sugar on teeth, and then I’d dole out the consequences.\nI’ve got a log in my eye. I think my kids have the problem, but really it’s me. I expect my kids to adhere to a standard that I definitely do not hold myself to. I find myself extending that double standard of judgment readily and easily to other people as well.\nHave you ever found yourself saying to your friends, “I can’t even imagine doing what she did”? And while it’s possible that you may never be tempted by that specific sin, you are tempted by your besetting sins. We all have those secret sins that we don’t want anyone to know about. And we all have our personal favorite everyday-variety sins that we brush away. Perhaps we’ve just brushed them away so many times that we cease to even think of them as sins. \nIt’s so much easier to focus on the speck in your brother’s eye, or the flaw in your sister’s character. But I’m just looking past the timber lodged in my own eye when I start looking around for everyone else’s sawdust.\nHonestly, we love to judge others differently than we judge ourselves. I have reasons, excuses, justifications for my own faults. And that’s it: when we’re talking about me, they are “faults” or “weaknesses”—definitely not sins. Or so I tell myself. But God has shown us more grace than we could ever show anyone else. Knowing this, how can I judge? \nThe poet G.M. Hopkins writes:\n“Mend first [the] vital candle in close heart’s vault:\nYou there are master, do your own desire;\nWhat hinders? Are you beam-blind, yet to a fault\nin a neighbor deft-handed? Are you that liar[?]”\nAre you beam-blind? Do you ignore the guttering of your own candle while criticizing someone else’s flame? Do you, while camped out in utter darkness, judge the dim light of others? Do you admonish others for candy-grabbing, while you actually do the same yourself, in secret?\nMay God grant us ears to hear and hearts to receive this rebuke to our hypocrisy. May we not trample such precious pearls of admonition, ignoring our logs. And thanks be to God, that He does not deal with us as our iniquities deserve, but has poured out mercy on us! (Psalm 103:10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:7-12, Proverbs 8:12-21, James 1:5-6, Revelation 3:19-20\nMy kids are constantly reminding me of how I behave with my heavenly Father—that is, like a child. It’s so incredibly humbling. \nOne such incident occurred a few years back, when we took our kids out for dinner on a Friday night. We were too stuffed for dessert, but when you go to the Cheesecake Factory and don’t order cheesecake, I’m pretty sure a puppy dies or an angel loses its wings. So we ordered a couple of slices to-go, my husband and I secretly planning to make a fun memory with the kids later that night.\nIt was already an hour past the kids’ bedtime when we headed home. Even so, as we drove, my oldest, who was seven at the time, grew concerned that his fun evening out with the family was coming to an abrupt end. He fretted and squirmed the whole ride home, even when we told him we had a surprise planned and encouraged him to trust us. But he just couldn’t. He made himself miserable worrying about the cheesecake and bedtime and other things seven-year-olds worry about.\nEven if you’re an adult, my guess is you can identify with this, at least a little.  \nThe plan was way better than he could have asked or imagined. Bedtime would have been a perfectly practical choice, but Ryan and I had planned to park in our little downtown, find a pretty place to sit, and enjoy a ridiculously late-night cheesecake feast with the kids, by the light of the moon.\nIt was a pretty great plan. It was the plan all along. \nAny amount of fretting and whining our kids did on the ride home, when they were certain they were going straight to bed, didn’t change what we had planned for them. We wanted to give them a sweet experience—not because of their good behavior, but because they are our children, we delight in them, and we wanted to give them a good gift.\n“If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him” (Matthew 7:11).\nWe have some pretty big ideas of how our lives should go. We feel strongly about what we don’t want to happen, and we’re perfectly willing to spend our entire lives fretting and fussing, not trusting that God is for us. \nOur Father wants to give us bread and fish and moonlit cheesecake picnics. He also wants to give us appropriate bedtimes and vegetables. Jesus knew His disciples were going to need righteousness, purity, unity, wisdom, humility, and more to carry out the work that was coming. And so He’s essentially saying to them, and us, “Just ask! It’s all yours!”\nHe has a pretty great plan. It’s been His plan all along.\nDo you lack wisdom? Is there something else you need in order to carry out the Father’s work? Do you trust that He will equip you with every supply? \nThe Father gives to His children generously and ungrudgingly (James 1:5). So go ahead: Ask. Seek. Knock. “For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened” (Matthew 7:8).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:13-23, Psalm 16:7-11, Matthew 22:1-14, John 10:11-15, John 14:1-6, Romans 2:12-13\nI was once the proud owner of my very own pair of scratch ‘n sniff pants. Every time I bring this up, I receive looks as if I’ve been the victim of an unfortunate crime and then asked, “What was the scent? Sweat? Soap? Linen?” (Incidentally, I do think this was a missed opportunity in the ‘90s for laundry detergent companies.) But no, they were purple and smelled like grapes, of course.\nAs you can imagine, I was sitting high and walking tall in those bad boys. My friends marveled at the way they really did smell like grapes, and I loved letting people in on the secret. Purple pants were one thing, but grape-scented purple pants gave me a real edge in the fashion world. But it only lasted for so long. It turns out that the fruity fragrance was only guaranteed to last for the first ten washes. And since I wanted to maximize the appearance of my newfound style sense, those ten washes came and went pretty fast.\nSo there I was, boasting about the scratch ‘n sniff goodness, only for it to be gone. The worst part? No one believed I ever owned scratch ‘n sniff pants in the first place, and there’s little point to owning purple pants if they don’t smell like grapes. Just smelling like a fruit wasn’t enough; it wasn’t long-lasting, and it definitely wasn’t genuine.\nMatthew 7 talks about two kinds of fruits: good and bad. It says once we see a piece of fruit, we’ll know exactly which tree it came from. “A good tree can’t produce bad fruit; neither can a bad tree produce good fruit” (v.18).\nBut what if it smells good but looks bad? What if the person putting the sticker on the fruit uses the wrong one? Or, questions we more commonly ask:\nWhat if I sometimes sin and sometimes do the right thing?\nWhat if I repent after I do something wrong?\nWhat if I look like I have it all together from the outside, but I’m a mess on the inside?\nAll of these questions are rooted in fear:\nWhat will God do with me then?\nWill I still get into heaven?\nAm I enough?\nFriends, I love a good gray area as much as a pair of purple pants, but nothing about a gray area is eternal. There’s nothing—and no one—standing in “the undecided middle” that will not one day be sorted into good or bad. It will not be enough to just smell or taste like good fruit; we must be fruit grown from the love of God.\nBut let’s not be so foolish as to take this passage from the Sermon on the Mount, this lack of middle ground, as a scare tactic. May we always remember that the work has already been done. God separated the world into darkness and light, and Jesus grabbed us by the hand and took us to His side. It is the truest grace that we do not have to live in a gray area. Thanks be to God; we have already entered into the kingdom if we are in Christ Jesus.\nMay we smell like His fruit, and serve like His hands, just as we are remembered by His love. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:24-29, Psalm 18:1-6, Isaiah 17:10-11, Matthew 25:1-13, 2 Corinthians 3:18, James 2:20-23\nSomewhere in Nashville there’s a toddler-sized red and white cowgirl outfit from the 60s, complete with embroidered yellow flowers and white leather fringe. It was given to my daughter by our elderly neighbors, brought out of a wooden chest and handed to my wide-eyed girl when she was about 3 years old. Now, several years later, it circulates among my friends and their own little wide-eyed girls. \nCarlton and Joyce were good neighbors, always watching over our small yard from the front porch of their brick cottage across the street. I winced from my own front porch the day the wrecking ball swung with intention and knocked down that empty house. My toddler boys watched in delight and awe as the big, loud machines did their work, but my heart ached. \nMy friends lived three decades of life in that house. They raised their girls there, watching their city grow tall around them. They collected snowman figurines and looked out for their neighbors. Then, when most of their life had been lived, they moved on and let the wrecking ball do its worst. \nThe thing that strikes me about this short passage in Matthew is not the dichotomy of outcome, but the similarity of process. One house collapses with a crash and one stands strong—the contrast is stark. But the circumstances the two houses endure are remarkably similar. In fact, they are just the same: “The rain fell, the rivers rose, the winds blew and pounded that house” (Matthew 7:25, 27). Similar process, very different outcome. \nAll of our earthly houses will one day fall. We’re all honest enough to admit it. We know the things of earth don’t last and we’d do well to store up eternal possessions instead. But how do we do that? How do we build a metaphorical house that literally lasts forever? \n“Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock” (Matthew 7:24). \nHear Jesus’ words. Act on Jesus’ words. This is how we practically and actually build our house on the rock. \nDid your brain just register that last little paragraph as, “Be a good Christian”? If so, you’re not alone. I hear that, too. So let’s slow down and consider it again. \nHear Jesus’ words. Act on Jesus’ words. Here are just a handful of them: \n“Repent and believe the good news!” (Mark 1:15).\n“Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28).\n“Love one another. Just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another” (John 13:34).\n“Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you” (Matthew 7:7).\n“The one who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, will have streams of living water flow from deep within him” (John 7:38).\nThe words of Christ are life-giving; they are trustworthy and true. We can stake our lives on them. We can build our houses on them. \nHis words do not merely impart rules for smart living—tips for a favorable outcome. Jesus’ words impart life and love and salvation. The life Christ gives cannot be washed away by heavy rains, or consumed by the rising tide, or displaced by gale-force winds. His Word is eternal. It cannot become untrue. \nSo then, go ahead and build your life. Build houses and meet neighbors and raise wide-eyed girls and boys. Let’s live well this one life we’ve been given, but let’s do so on the only foundation that will last: the gospel of Jesus Christ. For when all our years and efforts and cottages crumble around us, His Word will stand. We are forever secure when our home is found in Him.\n \n",

In the present, right-here world, life is volatile and uncertain. And yet, we know the saying is true: This world is not our home. Our citizenship is in a greater, coming Kingdom—a Kingdom we will only know in part while we live here on earth (Philippians 3:20).\nSo how do we do that? How do we live in two worlds at the same time? How do we live in the reality of this present, imperfect world in light of the heavenly life to come?\nAt the beginning of Jesus’ longest recorded sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, He speaks eight blessings to the crowd. These blessings, known as the Beatitudes, shed light on the tension you and I are living in as women who trust our Savior, yet face actual pain, poverty, emptiness, and all manner of brokenness in our right-now lives. \nThe temptation is to see this list of blessings as a formula to a better, happier life. But as Dallas Willard puts it, “The Beatitudes simply cannot be ‘good news’ if they are understood as a set of ‘how-tos’ for achieving blessedness. They would then only amount to a new legalism” (Willard, Divine Conspiracy). So if the Beatitudes aren’t how-tos, what are they? Put simply, they are facts. They are truths of the kingdom of God.\nBecause of the finished work of Jesus on our behalf, the Beatitudes are not a mere wish list or to-do list; they are the blessings that are already ours in Christ. In the vast love, grace, mercy, and goodness of our Savior, the least are given the Kingdom. Those who hunger and mourn, the poor and the meek, the “spiritual zeros”—we are blessed with the riches of Christ. Not just later, but right now, right here. \nNo matter how comfortable the house, we’ll never feel fully at home in this world; we were made for the coming one. But while we’re here, we have a job to do. Our job is not to earn our blessings; Jesus did that. Our assignment is to be salt and and light to the very world that makes us fidget with discomfort. As those who carry the life of Jesus around in us, we have a message of hope to offer a dying world (2 Corinthians 4:10). We hold out the Word of Life, inviting our neighbors “to taste and see that the Lord is good” (Psalm 34:8).\nAs we study this short but impactful passage at the beginning of Matthew 5, may our hearts assume a posture of gratitude toward the God who grants us His very Kingdom through the life, death, and resurrection of His Son. And as we give thanks for the blessings that are secured for us in Christ, may we be quick to scatter the knowledge of Jesus to those around us.\nThe Kingdom is His, and all are welcome. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Matthew 5:3, Ephesians 2:1-10, Revelation 3:17-22\n“He only who is reduced to nothing in himself, and relies on the mercy of God, is poor in spirit.”\n-John Calvin\nWhen we were first married, we spent half a year working for a company after they stopped paying us. We had signed a contract for a year, but halfway in they came upon hard times, and the paychecks just stopped. We were committed to the project, had a little money saved up, and didn’t really know what to do, so we finished the contract.\nNow that we are older, a little less idealistic, and more laden with responsibilities, we probably wouldn’t be able to manage that. Granted, the word “poor” is relative, and short of insurmountable homeless starvation, we’re all holding on okay. But during that particular season, we were poor. \nI don’t like to be poor. I don’t even like to feel poor.\nMoney is an insulation from the world. We use it to keep from feeling hungry, cold, and sad. Strength and power insulate us, too—all these things give us the illusion that we are in control. But the “poor in spirit” are those who have no power; they are the demoralized, the dejected. They can be fiscally poor, or lonely, or rejected; but regardless, they have lost all hope of finding power in themselves. \nIn the eyes of the world, the poor in spirit are the lowest of the low. People who can’t help themselves, or people who don’t believe in themselves, must not deserve all the good things life has to offer, we reason. We put so much value on hard work and grit that the poor in spirit are the most undervalued members of society.\nBut that’s the upside down version. The world is upside down, but Christ sets things right again. When He said “the last shall be first,” He meant it (Matthew 20:16). The poor in spirit have nothing, but that nothingness empties them of the illusion of their own power, enabling them to rely wholly on God. And to those who totally rely on Him, God gives the earth as an inheritance. He doesn’t promise that they’ll conquer the earth in their own power, somehow taking it for themselves; they will inherit the earth. For the meek, the earth will come to them gently, naturally, like a bequest. The world is upside down, but God sets it upright again.\nIn an unexpected way, we suddenly have reason to be grateful for the absence of paychecks, the blindsiding blows, and the losses that reduce us to emptiness. Poverty of the heart forces us to rely on the mercy of God. Jesus says they are “blessed” and “happy” who find themselves poor in spirit. Without our insulating security we have no refuge but God, and that blessed contradiction is a glimpse of what earth will look like, right side up, as it is heaven (Matthew 6:10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebekah Lyons\n\nText: Matthew 5:4, Isaiah 61:1-3, Romans 7:21-25, 2 Corinthians 7:8-10\nFifteen years ago, during a bleak February chill, I awoke early and jumped in the shower, ready to head back to the hospital. I’d been without our firstborn son—still less than a week old—for almost eight hours. And it was killing me.\nThe phone rang, and I heard Gabe answer. I knew it was the doctor calling with the lab results. Sixty seconds crawled by before Gabe cracked open the bathroom door. Seeing the look on his face, I collapsed. \nThere will never be words to describe the pain I felt at that moment. I had no idea I was capable of such grief, yet there I was, wailing. I could not shed the anguish fast enough. \nGabe and I drove to the hospital in silence. I realized I didn’t know a single person with Down syndrome. I was ashamed I’d overlooked this community, a sorority of mothers whose children had Down syndrome—a sorority to which I now belonged. \nSome people have been taught that the Christian life makes no room for sadness, gives no permission to mourn, allows no time for lament. This kind of mental toughness might seem a practical approach for immediate survival, but unexpressed grief can become a bitterness that chokes us. When we dull our pain, we dull our joy. When we numb our lows, we numb our highs. \nJesus has a different perspective on grief. He never lacked emotion or expression. He “was a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief” (Isaiah 53:3). And in His impassioned Sermon on the Mount, He gives us this promise: “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted” (Matthew 5:4).\nWhen we grieve—not if—we will be comforted. \nNot long after His sermon, Jesus experienced this for Himself. “He took Peter and Zebedee’s two sons, James and John, and He became anguished and distressed. He told them, ‘My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me’” (Matthew 26:37).\nJesus wept from empathy, from disappointment, from pain. He mourned, and when He was finished mourning, He surrendered to the work of God—work that brought great freedom to all of us. \nSince that fateful February morning, I’ve grieved with friends who have walked through fear and loss. Loss of love and marriage vows. Loss of sanity and peace. Loss of life, in the womb and out. And I’ve watched those same folks experience the death of their own will, and by His grace, receive Jesus’ comfort instead. \nNone of us wants to encounter such deep grief in our lifetimes. But the more we mourn our sin and need, pain and loss, the more we can trust and anticipate the gracious comfort Christ Jesus promises to bring. \n\n \n",

As a child, I whiled away many an afternoon hour at the dining room table, painstakingly working to capture the essence of a mare and her young colt. Occasionally, they’d take flight as a pegasus or grow into a purple-horned unicorn. But more often than not, I fashioned my horses a traditional brown or black—always majestic, racing through a large Crayola®-green pasture, wild, free, and unbridled. \nFueling my wonder was a racehorse farm, just down the road from my childhood home. On slow summer mornings, my mother would walk with me, hand-in-hand, to admire the horses. Together, we’d watch them from the outside of endless white fences, their tails flick-flick-flicking away flies in the heat. On rare occasions, she’d lead me to the stables for a closer look, to stroke their muzzles, my fingers tentatively dancing across a velvety smooth coat. I’d stare deeply into the eyes of those beautiful beasts, in awe of their quiet, controlled demeanor—steely strength enveloped in a gentle disposition. \nThough humble in temperament and committed to the service of their master, you’d never doubt the power of these statuesque creatures. You would never think them weak. These animals are bred, born, and groomed for a few minutes of all-out greatness, and yet the day-to-day submission of their own will to that of their master’s is somehow equally awe-inspiring. The master has proven to be good and worthy of their trust. And so they wait on him. \nCommit your way to the Lord;\ntrust in Him, and He will act…\nBe silent before the Lord and wait expectantly for Him…\n-Psalm 37:5,7\nThis is a picture of meekness: strength and power under control, submitted to the authority of the Father. He created us to bear His image and to bring Him glory (Genesis 1:27; Isaiah 43:7). And while we can honor God in deed and action—in how we run the race—we also glorify Him in our waiting and trusting in Him. We glorify Him in our meekness, too.\nScripture tells us Moses was the meekest man on the face of the earth, but he was far from weak (Numbers 12:3). The man who confronted Pharaoh, led the Israelites’ exodus out of Egypt, and parted the Red Sea, was empowered by God Almighty to lead and perform miracles in His name, yet he remained humble in spirit. He was just a foretaste of Jesus Christ, our Savior to come (Matthew 11:29). \nHe was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a lamb that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers, So He did not open His mouth.\n-Isaiah 53:7\nJesus had all the authority of heaven and earth given to Him, yet He submitted His will to the Father (Matthew 28:18). The same God who met face to face with Moses endured the cross for the joy set before Him (Hebrews 12:2). He did it for us—we are His joy, His prize. This is the God who fights for us; we need only to be still and wait for Him (Exodus 14:14). \nWe live in a world that distracts us from our true inheritance. At every turn, we’re told to make our desires happen now and on our own terms. But that’s orphan living, and we are daughters of the King. All that He has is already ours in Christ Jesus (2 Peter 1:3). Our inheritance is already secure.\n \nKara Gause is an editor for She Reads Truth happily residing in Nashville, Tennessee. She’s married to one swell fella and mother to a set of delightfully spirited twin girls. Sunsets and snow cones are near and dear to her heart, as is anything or anyone who reminds her of God’s goodness.\n",

Yes, specifically the green ones, and no, his stomach does not agree. \nThe main reason our goldendoodle puppy keeps finding acorns is because, well, it’s fall and they’re everywhere. He sniffs them out with the same tenacity I use when looking for a stray piece of gum in my purse. Before you know it, he’s crunch-crunch-crunching away. Again. \nWe’ve scolded him repeatedly, enrolled him in puppy school, and used lots of bribery. But when it’s not green acorns, he’s gnawing anything from a wooden armchair to a human hand, and at that point, I’ll take the pesky acorn any day. All the while, he ignores his full bowl of dog food, and although I haven’t tasted it myself, I’ll bet it tastes better than all those other things. When will he learn to eat the right things? \nBetter yet, when will we?\nI’m hungry all the time. Of course, my stomach rumbles when I don’t eat breakfast or eye the pint of ice cream in the fridge, but it’s even more frequent than that—I’m ravenous for approval, control, love, and fulfillment.

Friends, we, too, are missing the satisfaction already set out for us—in Christ. \n“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.”\n– Matthew 5:6\nI tend to picture the person who hungers and thirsts for righteousness as a total kill-joy, as if this verse is telling them—and us—to go on a strict righteousness cleanse. But it’s not! No, it’s  inviting us into something so much better. Paul explains the distinction like this: “Because they disregarded the righteousness from God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves to God’s righteousness. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes” (Romans 10:3-4).\nIf we are left to feed on our own righteousness, we will starve. But when we feed on the righteousness of Christ, we will be satisfied. On the cross, Jesus knew He was the only thing that would satisfy, and even in our longings today, it still rings true. We cannot create or earn righteousness on our own; we can only partake in the gift of His. \nIn contrast to our worldly desires that leave us longing and hungry for more, our satisfaction in Christ only increases with our hunger for Him. The more we seek first the kingdom of God, the more we will be fulfilled by His goodness—a taste of eternal satisfaction in the life to come. \n“But I will see Your face in righteousness;\nwhen I awake, I will be satisfied with Your presence.”\n– Psalm 17:15\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Matthew 5:7, James 2:15-20, Matthew 18:21-35\nI recently deleted the Facebook app from my phone in an effort to scroll less and live more. I’ve begun to realize how often I scroll and just how terrible it makes me feel. A quick scan of my social media feed this morning inspired plenty of emotion in me, but not an ounce of understanding, compassion, or grace. \nWe live in a time of outrage, not of mercy. \nReading all these passages about mercy, then writing about it and thinking about it, only made me more confused. It’s like when you stare at a word so long that, suddenly, it no longer seems to be spelled correctly, or the true meaning of the word escapes you altogether.\nSo what exactly is mercy? And why do I see so little of it in my own heart for others?\nAfter thinking it over and working through these scripture passages, this is the best I’ve got: mercy is standing before someone who deserves punishment, and then throwing them a party instead. You’d think it would be easy to accept a free party. But we’ve all been taught from an early age that “there’s no free lunch.” How can we live in a world of dollars and cents, blame and responsibility, and yet still accept mercy? \nThe story in Matthew 18 shows just how hard that is. We’re not told why this man had so much debt, but it’s probably safe to say he over-leveraged himself or gambled his way into oblivion. He did something that the rest of the world—from a place of safety or self-righteousness—might call foolish. And yet the king took pity on him, forgiving not only his debt, but also the character flaws that had landed him in debt in the first place. \nBut when the forgiven man walked out of the king’s presence, he made a beeline for the first person he could think of who owed him money. What if the king were to change his mind? Perhaps next time, the king won’t be so merciful. And so, loved by a king, the man became a tyrant.\nFurthermore, his beliefs about the king became a self-fulfilling prophesy. He didn’t trust mercy, so he didn’t extend mercy, which landed him in prison—exactly where he’d expected to end up all along. When he reached prison, I imagine he felt justified: I knew he’d come after me all along.\nThis man’s behavior is familiar territory. At times, I find that I expect God to come back around, change His mind, and demand payment for all of my mistakes. Worst of all, I believe the difficult situations that come my way are His punishment in disguise, rather than believing the circumstances of my life are God’s best for me. But God has no punishment left for us (Romans 8:1).\nGod is not waiting for me to mess up. He is not standing, ready with a long list of all my other failures, to justify why the mercy I thought I received didn’t actually count. Jesus loves me—and you—fully, deeply, permanently. It is final and it is finished (John 3:16; 19:30). \nThinking through all this helps me to see myself and the people around me with new eyes. It even changes the way I look at my Facebook feed, believe it or not. There is no one we’ll encounter today, on our social media feeds or elsewhere, who is not in need of mercy. And you and I have the privilege of extending it to them, because Christ has secured irrevocable mercy for us.\n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Matthew 5:8, Ezekiel 36:22-28, Psalm 24:1-10, Revelation 22:1-5\nThe doctor’s office wasn’t on my list of must-see destinations in Italy, but it’s the one I got to check off the list just 72 hours into my semester abroad. \nI’d intentionally chosen a program without any familiar faces—just me and the open road! Instead, it was just me… and the scratching. And the hives.\nThe minute the itchiness ensued, I immediately began washing all my clothes and sheets, then used every last drop of my brand-new bottle of soap in the shower. But it got worse, sending me to the farmacia, which was closed, followed by the doctor’s office, all the while accompanied by a translator who did not know the word for “hives.”\nThis isn’t the first time I’d taken matters into my own hands, working to scrub away my flaws for a pristine exterior. Just today, I’ve held doors, given compliments, and tweeted Scripture—which are all good things, but my motives are off. And do you know what I see when I do these things? Nothing. I’m hiding so well that I don’t see a thing—not myself, and definitely not God. \nSitting in the doctor’s office chair, I listened to the translator and the doctor intensely converse, unable to decipher what they were saying. Then, the translator turned to me, diagnosing an allergic reaction to an ingredient specific to Italian soap and detergent. \nWhat I’d been using to hide and treat my condition was actually the root of my problem. My attempts to outwardly correct my inward shame had only exposed it more. \nWhen I read, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (Matthew 5:8), I’m sent scrambling, trying to scrub my heart of its impurities. Reading that verse makes me want to work harder and look better. But in reality, I start to hide more, feel less, and then wonder why I can’t see God in the midst of my shame.\nI want to see Him. I want to see Him so badly that I’ve shamed my sinful heart into hiding. But Praise the Lord, He is not hiding from us, and nothing is hidden from Him. God sees us and knows us long before we could ever think to seek Him. He saw us first. \nFor “Man does not see what the Lord sees, for man sees what is visible, but the Lord sees the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7). He sees us when we are impressive, as well as indecent. He knows our hiding places and wants to give us a better one (Psalm 32:7). \nWhile we are busy trying to correct our outward behavior and conceal our inward brokenness, we miss the work God is already doing:\n“For I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.”\n–Ezekiel 36:24-28\nBy His grace, may we stop hiding from Him in shame, and instead turn to face the One who has already blessed us with the purity of Christ and washed us clean.\n \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Matthew 5:9, Matthew 10:26-31, Ephesians 2:11-22, John 14:27-31, Psalm 34:1-22\nThe womb is where I learned that relationships take work. I shared the space with my twin sister, Nikki. With four elbows, four knees, and twenty fingers and toes jammed into such cramped corners, I doubt peace was a part of my prenatal development. I’ve been fighting for peace in my relationships ever since. \nYou too?\nI’m not sure where we got the impression that once life reaches a certain cruising altitude, we can wave goodbye to turbulence. Every era in history is marked with wars and rumors of wars, and every decade of our lives brings its share of tensions, squabbles, and cold shoulders. Turmoil is a constant in our changing world. Jesus was not naïve to this reality. He calls us to pursue peace anyway. \nIf you read through the Beatitudes as a list of dos and don’ts, you might find yourself tripping on this one: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God” (Matthew 5:9). \nAre you able to change the habits that wreak havoc on your relationships? If you were, you would have done it already. \nAre you able to force reconciliation between your bickering children or squabbling neighbors? Probably not. There’s strike two. \nAre you able to resolve the conflicts raging across the geopolitical landscape? Nope. Strike three!\nBut where we are weak, Christ’s power is made perfect (2 Corinthians 12:9). The gospel never fails to shoot up a beacon of hope. \nThis list of blessings handed down from Jesus goes far beyond a checklist for right living. It lays the groundwork for the gospel. We can’t begin to get relief in our relationships or to move toward others in reconciliation without first looking to the cross. \nTrue peace is a byproduct of Christ’s work of the cross. True reconciliation begins with His work on our behalf, then bubbles over into our connections with each other. We can only be peacemakers by carefully following Christ’s lead. \nApart from Jesus, we were once left in a sorry state: separated, alienated, hopeless strangers— alone (Ephesians 2:11-12). “But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility” (vs. 13-14). \nApart from Christ, all of life is war. We war within ourselves as we rebel against God’s best. We war against others as our sin sends shrapnel into one another’s hearts. The cross is the only bridge to true peace. \nThe beautiful message of the gospel is that Jesus Himself is our peace. The cross worked like a sledgehammer, tearing down the wall of hostility we erected with our own sin. He simply asks us to wave the white flag of surrender to His work of reconciliation. \nThis reminder gives us what we need to pursue reconciliation with others. The grace that has been lavished upon us gives us the strength to extend grace to others. We can forgive because we’ve been forgiven, pursue peace because we serve the Peacemaker, mend broken relationships because we’ve been stitched up with the thread of grace. \nThis process of pursuing reconciliation also gives us a taste of what’s to come; it’s a preview of an eternity marked with perfect peace. Hostility will end. Tears will dry. Apologies will become antiquated. Those of us who have surrendered our lives to the Peacemaker will be blessed indeed.\n\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Matthew 5:10-12, Philippians 1:27-30, 2 Timothy 3:10-17, 1 Peter 1:6-7\nThe internet is not for the faint of heart. Maybe you’ve noticed this, too. Behind the protection of a computer screen and social media, people lose their inhibitions and speak with a recklessness they wouldn’t otherwise. Strangers, acquaintances, and even friends launch virtual grenades that leave behind very real wounds.\nI learned this lesson the hard way, soon after I started writing. Each week, I poured my heart and soul into words about Jesus, hoping to build up my readers while challenging them in their faith. I studied and prayed and edited and dreamed, and then, I released my ideas into the world. I remember hitting the “publish” button one of those first very times and, thirty minutes later, a comment appeared from one of my precious readers: “The author sounded whiney.”\nCome to find out, this would be one of the gentler comments in a string of skin-thickening insults. It was my cold-splash initiation into the world of writing online, a world that is sometimes beautiful and sometimes brutal.\nThese experiences have taught me a lot over the years, but one lesson always stands out. When someone insults you, there is a subtle temptation lurking just behind it: to tear your critic down in the form of sympathy. “He is probably just a sad person,” or “Hurt people hurt people,” or “She’s just jealous.” I have said all of these things and more, and some of those assessments might even be true. But Jesus’ response to insults looks radically different.\nIn Matthew chapter 5, Jesus doesn’t focus on His critics’ motives. Instead, He points to the kingdom of God: “You are blessed when they insult and persecute you and falsely say every kind of evil against you because of Me. Be glad and rejoice, because your reward is great in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you” (vv. 11-12).\nIt doesn’t matter how you were brought low—you meek, you downtrodden, you spiritual misfits—because God works wonders among the lowly. If people slander you or insult you because of Christ’s name, you don’t have to cower and you don’t have to flee, because the other side of death is always, always resurrection. Not around the shame, but through it.\nThis, in many ways, is the entire message of the Beatitudes.\nBut the news gets even better. This Kingdom isn’t some far-off reality. We’re tasting it now. The blessing is already here. We rejoice, not because the reward is distant, but because it’s near. Amidst the insults, the name-calling, the persecution and the slander, God does some of His very best work. He heals. He humbles. He overcomes strongholds. He seizes our fragile idols and shatters them on the ground. He takes our shame and our humiliation and He makes them submit to His reign. And that, my friends, is why we rejoice.\nWe don’t have to be afraid. We don’t have to feel threatened or timid about the truth, as if we have to defend it, or ourselves, to keep our joy. The Beatitudes remind us that God’s upside down Kingdom doesn’t work that way. God’s ways are higher than our ways, and our call is to bear witness to that truth. \nWe don’t have to let the fear of insult or persecution sway us from obedience. Instead, we can step into it with confidence, knowing God’s good plans for the persecuted. Even in our hurt and shame, the Kingdom is breaking in, and our lives are a big, bright flashing signpost beckoning the world to Him.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, and mom of two boys.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Matthew 5:13-16, Colossians 4:5-6, Isaiah 42:5-9\nYou know that scene in It’s a Wonderful Life where George and Mary help the Martini family move into their new home? They load up the Martini children (and goat) into their car and drive them to Bailey Park, entourage-style, a truck piled high with the family’s belongings following behind them. As the townspeople gather triumphantly on the stoop of the Martinis’ new home, Mary offers this housewarming blessing:\n“Bread, that this house may never know hunger. Salt, that life may always have flavor.” Then George jumps in and takes over because he just can’t help himself: “And wine, that joy and prosperity may reign forever!”\nI’ve always loved that scene. It’s so hopeful, so filled with joy and promise. We want to believe that George and Mary’s best wishes can bestow true blessing on the young family, but we know the turmoil that lies ahead for the small, fictional town. Like the folks of Bedford Falls would discover, we know best wishes don’t bring life. Only God can do that.\nThat’s what we find when we read the Beatitudes: blessings only God can give, promises only Jesus can make. These aren’t just promises for our future—though they are certainly that. They are promises for our right-now life. They are promises of God’s kingdom come here on earth as it is in heaven.\nThis is the gospel. Sinners—ordinary, imperfect people like you and me—are ushered into the kingdom of God by none other than God’s own Son. Jesus came to this pain-ridden planet and lived the holy, sinless life we couldn’t, then paid the debt of our sin in full on the cross. Three days after it was finished, He walked out of the grave, and He sits at the right hand of His Father even now. And there, now, He claims as His own—holy and blameless children of the Father—we who accept the absurd gift of His grace.\nWe are heirs with Christ to God’s kingdom. We belong there. It is our home.\nWe mourn the pain and death and injustice of our right-now world, but we rejoice in the One who will dry every tear (Revelation 21:4). We are poor in spirit, in possessions, in esteem, yet we are filled up by the One who created all things and holds all things together (Colossians 1:16-17). We hunger for a holiness that we can’t reach here, while we give thanks to the One who clothes us in His righteousness (Romans 5:17). We ache for mercy and peace in a warring world, and we worship the One who is setting everything right (Revelation 21:5).\nWe are children of the Kingdom—not just when we leave this world, but right here in it.\nThe gospel of Jesus is not a secret to be kept. It is the conspicuous, live-changing reality for every single person who calls Christ their Lord. It is the very definition of good news! How can we help but overflow with gratitude and love for the God who has rescued us from despair and secured our hope?\nOur God has made us a beacon of hope to the world, “a covenant for the people and a light to the nations, in order to open blind eyes, to bring out prisoners from the dungeon, and those sitting in darkness from the prison house” (Isaiah 42:6-7). We are light bearers, sight givers, and freedom bringers—this is our reality in Christ. \nFriends, we have so much more to offer the world than our best wishes. We know the Maker of love, the Giver of life. When others look at us, may they see Him. Amen. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Matthew 27:57-66, Matthew 28:1-15\nMy husband is deathly afraid of heights. \nHis fear only emerges every now and then. At the lake, for instance, when invited to go cliff-jumping with friends, and he declines. Or after finally reaching the summit of a long hike, when I step forward to peer over the edge, and he takes a giant step back. His fear isn’t debilitating—it’s just always there, lingering. So I didn’t anticipate his reaction when I booked our “doors off” helicopter tour over Hawaii. \nThere we were, safety floatation devices secured, boarding the Hughes 500, which felt more like a toy car than a helicopter. As the propeller sliced through the air and we lifted off, I could barely contain my thrill. My husband, on the other hand, could barely contain his breakfast.\nFear hits us all, sometimes when we least expect it, and sometimes in the exact same place,  over and over again—no matter how many times the pilot tells us we’re safe. \nIn the days after Jesus’ crucifixion, we see how several different groups of people reacted to fear. Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Christ, courageously asked Pilate for Jesus’ body, then wrapped it in linen, and placed it in a tomb he’d previously bought for himself. Jesus’ friends, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, resolved to sit and wait and watch the tomb where Jesus was laid.\nMeanwhile, paranoia had overcome the chief of priests and Pharisees. Together, they convinced Pilate to send guards to the tomb—just in case the story wasn’t over. They feared Jesus’ disciples would steal His body and proclaim His resurrection (Matthew 27:57-66).\nA crew of centurions was sent to keep watch over the sealed tomb—a boring assignment; mundane work. Standing. Waiting. Guarding the grave of a dead man. What do they think is going to happen here?, they must have thought.  \nBut then, the earth shook. Rocks crumbled. The stone covering the grave rolled back, and an angel of the Lord appeared, his clothes white as lightning. “The guards were so afraid… they shook and became like dead men” (Matthew 28:1-4).\nWhat were they so afraid of?\nMaybe they were afraid of the earthquake, and afraid of the stranger strong enough to roll away the stone. Maybe they were afraid of being killed for treason, having lost the body of Jesus, an enemy of the state (Matthew 28:11-15). Maybe it was all of the above. \nThe centurions were afraid of dying, when the cure for death had been resurrected right in front of them.\nMary and Mary Magdalene encountered this same angel of the Lord. Trembling, they listened as an angel proclaimed that Jesus had defeated death, just as He said He would. He was risen! The story wasn’t over! What did they feel when they heard the news? \n“So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy…”\n-Matthew 28:8\nAfraid yet filled with joy. I love those words! \nIf you are afraid of who God might be, you’re not alone. The story of Jesus’ gruesome death and quaking resurrection should shake us to our core, just as it did the guards at the tomb. But believers have this distinct and extraordinary gift: our fear lives side by side with our joy. He is who He said He is—the very Son of God. What a fearsome, wonderful thought! \nOn the day of our helicopter ride, my husband was so nervous he couldn’t even look out onto the island thousands of feet below. But as we rode over the mountains and the Pacific Ocean, he saw me—smiling and pointing, unable to contain my enthusiasm—and he could look. Still afraid, yet filled with joy.\nThank you, Jesus, that Your glory is greater than our fear. When the world cowers in fear or tries to explain You away, give us courage to hold out the gospel. For You have defeated death itself. You alone are our joy.

An older relative of mine, on the other hand, lands far on the other end of the spectrum. She just so happens to currently have seven cars parked in her driveway. And though I get frustrated having to play automobile Tetris each time I go to her house for dinner, her reasoning for possessing these cars is actually quite sweet—they belonged to her loved ones.\nAmong the vehicles are her father’s Cadillac, her mother’s Honda, and the barely-driveable GMC minivan that her now-grown children practically lived in for most of their middle-school and high-school sports careers. I’ve tried multiple times to convince her to donate these cars to a charitable organization, but she just can’t bear to let go. She wants to hold on.\nThis sentiment of holding on to the past is one most of us can, at least somewhat, relate to. But it is even more exaggerated and understandable when we see Mary experiencing the risen Christ for the first time. When Mary finally realizes that the man talking to her outside the tomb is not the gardener but Jesus Himself, she addresses Him as “Rabboni,” meaning “my great teacher.” She sees Him as the person He was to her in His time on Earth, the man in the flesh, not what He is now—her Lord and Savior.\nOf course she would want to hold on to Him! He was the man who had quite literally set her free from the hold of demons. He had been her friend and her mentor. The last time Mary had laid eyes on Jesus, He had been brutally murdered—crucified—and she’d been weeping over the loss of Him for the past three days.\nBut Jesus wanted more for Mary than for her to cling to the past. He wants more for us, too. He had returned to give an assignment and to make a promise.\n“Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”\n-John 20:17\nJesus gives a similar commission when He appears to His disciples, who are locked in a meeting room upstairs. He greets them with peace but does not linger. Instead, He promises that His very presence will be with them now and into eternity. With a first-hand account of His resurrection and Jesus’ guarantee of help from His Holy Spirit, the disciples are sent off to do the work of setting others free with the message of the gospel (Matthew 28:19-20).\nJesus calls us, as the Church, to that same beautiful work. Are we sharing the good news of His life, death, and resurrection? Are we parking it away in our hearts, or are we passing it on? What keeps us from sharing the gospel with those who need its truth just as desperately as we do?\nIf the sound of Christ’s commissioning words in John 20:21, “I am sending you,” causes a lump of fear, or pride, or disbelief to rise in your throat, remember this: when we take the gospel to others, just like those first disciples, we are not sent out alone. We bring with us His Word, planted in our hearts (Psalm 119:11). We bring with us the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:11), Who grows good fruit in us (Galatians 5:22-23). We bring the security of knowing our home is not here, but in eternity with God (Philippians 3:20).\nThis holy work—done in fellowship with the very Spirit of the risen Christ—is an immeasurable gift, worth more than anything else we cling to. We have been invited to tell a lost and aching world the truth of the resurrected Jesus. We’ve been asked to tell others Who He is and how fully He loves us. By God’s grace, may we do that today and every day—right here, and to the ends of the earth.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Encounters with Christ: On The Road to Emmaus",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Luke 24:13-35\nChrist’s walk with the disciples on the road to Emmaus is legendary. For years, I’ve watched people’s eyes glaze over as they sigh, “If only we could have heard that conversation! What I would give to hear Jesus explain the whole of Scripture!” It does feel like the golden ticket: the interpretation of Christ’s place in Scripture, beginning with Moses and the prophets, given by Christ Himself.\nBut even if the conversation were recorded and we had one more chapter there in Luke, detailing the truth in red letters, shining brightly in every Bible—would it make a difference? Would it make the Bible a better, more complete account? Would it finally give us the missing piece to complete our greater understanding of Scripture and godliness?\nAbsolutely not. Scripture is complete (Revelation 22:18-19). It’s also filled with interpretations, prophecies, and explanations of Christ’s place in God’s plan of redemption, from Genesis to Revelation. But this encounter with Christ on the road to Emmaus does feel special somehow.\nIt’s as if we can hear the disciples imploring, “Stay with us!” We can see Christ allowing them to savor those extraordinary moments with Him, their hearts “ablaze” from the truth and love shared in that rare, sweet conversation (John 24:29, 32).\nScripture is not a secret code. It is a revelation, shining light on everything under the sun. Yes, there is a rich mystery and paradox in a Creator who would send His own Son to die for His creation. But the gospel itself is not a secret. The gospel is simple:\n“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.”\n-John 3:16\nThere’s really only one story: the knight slays the dragon and rescues the princess (Isaiah 25:8). The gospel is in all of our stories. \nBut we don’t have to see it if we don’t want to. We can delude ourselves into believing that the gospel is too complicated to understand. Nevertheless, Christ brings light and truth (John 8:12). On the road to Emmaus, “He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,” and He has sent His Holy Spirit to do the same for us now (Luke 24:45; John 14:26).\nAmazingly, the longing we feel when reading about the Emmaus encounter is fulfilled in the Holy Spirit. Like those disciples, our hearts implore, “Stay with us!” and Christ answers, “Lo, I am with you always” (Matthew 28:20). He is indeed with us, and He continues to set our hearts ablaze by His abiding Spirit.\nWe, too, are called to be people of the Word and to walk by the Spirit. We can go forth in His freedom and light! We can know our Bibles and see that God’s redemptive hand has been at work for our good from the Old Testament through the New Testament, and even still today. We are rescued by His love and transformed by His redemption. The truth of the gospel is laid plain for us in Scripture, and Christ is with us! Thanks be to God.\n“Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. . . No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.”\n-Deuteronomy 30:11,14\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Encounters with Christ: Thomas",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nText: John 20:24-31\nThere was a period in my life when I identified with Thomas’ doubts. I read his story and was uncertain about the basics of my own faith. I questioned what I believed. Was Jesus who He said He was, and did He really rise from the grave? Has His resurrection truly brought me my salvation? Like Thomas, I wanted to see Him in the flesh and lay my hand on His scars.\nIt was a hard but good place to be. Wrestling with doubt and being honest about our questions can bring us to a deeper faith in a powerful way. \nThese days, I don’t spend as much time struggling with this type of doubt. By His grace, the Lord has somehow brought me to a more secure place, and I’m grateful that I no longer doubt as I used to. But as I read this story in John again, I realize it’s not that my doubting days are over, it’s just that my doubting looks different now.\nI think we’re all “Doubting Thomases” in our own way. Maybe I don’t doubt my faith as much as I once did, but I doubt other things. Take God’s character, for instance. I’ve sometimes wondered, Is He really good? Does He care for me? He was faithful those other times, but will He be faithful this time?\nSome days, I doubt the cross and its effectiveness in my life. I get stuck on questions like, Did Jesus really save me? Does His sacrifice still count, even when I continue to commit this same sin again and again?\nI doubt Christ’s steadfast love and the permanence of His forgiveness. Surely He’ll give up on me this time. Surely I’m no longer worthy to be called God’s child. Surely grace is for everyone else, but not for me.\nNo matter where we are in our faith/doubt journey, we all struggle with unbelief. That’s what makes Thomas’ story so encouraging. Although we doubt and question and are fearful in different ways, the answer—the proof we need—is the same for us as it was for Thomas. It’s found in Jesus’ words:\n“Put your finger here and observe My hands. Reach out your hand and put it into My side. Don’t be an unbeliever, but a believer.”\n-John 20:27\nI think it’s incredible that we serve a God who doesn’t shun us in our doubts but actually moves toward us in the midst of them, offering us the proof we’re asking for. In the midst of our unbelief, Jesus tells us to look to Him in order to believe again.\nWhat do you need to believe in today?\nIs it the basics of your faith? Look at the resurrection.\nObserve the scars on His hands and put your hand into His side.\nIs it God’s goodness? Look at God’s Son whom He sent to save us.\nObserve the scars on His hands and put your hand into His side.\nIs it His grace? Look at the cross.\nObserve the scars on His hands and put your hand into His side.\nJesus’ scars are not only our proof—they are our hope for every doubt. They are the Truth that casts out every fear and lie.\nJesus comes to us just as He came to Thomas in that room with the disciples. He invites us to see and believe for ourselves, so that we may trust in the resurrection and what it means for us—and what it will mean for us, every day of our lives and after.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Encounters with Christ: Peter’s Reinstatement",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebekah Lyons\n\nText: John 21:1-25\nAs darkness settled, Peter decided to go fishing.\nMaybe he thought it was the only thing left that he could control. Jesus, whom he loved, had died and risen again. He was overjoyed in knowing his beloved teacher and friend was alive, but guilt-ridden after denying Him (John 18:15-27). His shame had led him here, to familiar waters. With a few trusted friends by his side, Peter pushed off from the shore.\nVenturing out into the night, I imagine he looked for solace in the stars. Perhaps he hoped his old everyday routine would bring comfort. He cast his nets far to the left of the boat, but it was a no-go—the expert fisherman couldn’t catch a thing all night (John 21:3-4).\nAs the sun rose, they drifted toward the beach and looked up to find the Son of God standing on the shore, though they didn’t recognize Him.\n“‘Men,’ Jesus called to them, ‘you don’t have any fish, do you?’\n‘No,’ they answered.\n‘Cast the net on the right side of the boat,’ He told them, ‘and you’ll find some.’ So they did, and they were unable to haul it in because of the large number of fish. Therefore the disciple, the one Jesus loved, said to Peter, ‘It is the Lord!’” (John 21:5-7).\nRight then and there, Peter jumped into the water and swam to shore. Despite the angst in his own heart, he couldn’t help but be drawn to another encounter with his Savior and friend. However, there was still unfinished business between them. Before sending him out into the world to help rescue the souls of unbelievers, Jesus would gently restore Peter to Himself (Matthew 18:16-20).\nJesus had a feast waiting for them upon the shore—breakfast a la cookout, I like to call it—a hearty portion of grilled fish and bread, prepared for everyone (John 21:12-13). After they ate their fill, Jesus and Peter stole some moments alone. Jesus had come to do for Peter what He longs to do for each of us: He had come to remove Peter’s shame.\nAnd so for each of the three times Peter denied Him, Jesus asked:\nDo you love me?\nYes, Lord.\nFeed my lambs.\nDo you love me?\nYou know I love You.\nShepherd my sheep.\nDo you love me?\nYou know everything. You know that I love you.\nFeed my sheep.\n(John 21:15-17, my paraphrase)\nWhat I love most about this exchange is Jesus’ immediate grace toward Peter after the resurrection. Jesus knew Peter would likely carry the shame and guilt of his denial for the rest of his life, unless He intervened. The point of the cross, after all, was that guilt and sin would no longer hold us captive.\nThe resurrection power of Jesus sought Peter out, reminding him of everything they’d ever known in their friendship. First, Jesus once again confirmed His love for Peter, and allowed Peter to express his love in return. Then, He gave Peter instruction on how to further this message of love, the gospel. Despite Peter’s denial, his place in the Kingdom never changed. Jesus’ plan and purpose for him remained the same.\nWhen I think of all the ways I’ve blown it, the innumerable ways my actions should’ve thwarted God’s plan and call upon my life, I’m exceedingly humbled. In spite of our shortcomings, God promises to complete His good work in each of us (Philippians 1:6). His power and His love for us are far greater than our sin and shame.\nThis is the good news! This is the gospel.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Luke 24:36-53, John 16:4-33, Hebrews 10:11-14\nAs a kid growing up in Michigan—all blonde braids and denim overalls—I was sure that heaven must be a wonderful place, and equally certain that I was bound to see all the animals I loved there. I was less sure how I felt about worshipping and bowing around a big throne for all of eternity. And I was skeptical about angels and beasts saying, “Holy, holy, holy” (Revelation 4:8). Why so repetitive, anyway? And when would we get to eat clove-flavored gumdrops and jump on clouds?\nThe world has a lot to say about heaven, but much like my childhood vision, it’s often far more informed by wistful thinking than by Scripture. But wherever and whatever heaven is, we do know this to be true: when Christ left His disciples, He ascended to heaven (Luke 24:51), and “after offering one sacrifice for sins forever,” He “sat down at the right hand of God” (Hebrews 10:12). \nGod is in heaven, and Jesus sits at His right hand.\nI love having firm answers to biblical questions. Because honestly, my kids ask me stuff like this all the time, and I want to be a good and accurate teacher for them. The concept of Christ ascended to heaven could make us feel like Christ has disappeared from earth, but His ascension to His place at God’s right hand actually changes everything.\nThe Bible tells us that God the Father is Spirit, and He does not have a body like we do (John 4:24; Colossians 1:15). Jesus, on the other hand, does have a body, and He ascended in that body to His Father in heaven (Luke 24:39). Scripture also gives a glimpse, however limited, of the future awaiting us when our own bodies are raised even as Jesus was (I Corinthians 15:52; Romans 6:4). \nWe don’t know all the details of what heaven looks like, or how it will feel to be in the presence of God (though I reckon it’s going to be good!). We do, however, know that Christ is seated, signifying that His work is complete, and this changes not only our future, but the here and now. \nWhy? Because only by His ascension do we receive His Spirit (John 16:7). And our ascended Christ is, even now, interceding for us at the throne of God (1 Timothy 2:5; Romans 8:34). Jesus, right this instant, is serving as our High Priest! He has gone on to heaven to prepare a place for us (John 14:2), and He’s guaranteed to return for us, when He will judge both the living and the dead (John 14:3; 1 Peter 4:5).\nWhat difference does this knowledge make to us now? It turns our sorrows into joy (John 16:20)! \nBecause Christ’s work is complete, our salvation is secure. His ascension and enthronement mean that our hope is sure, and we can have confidence as we approach the throne of grace, and joy as we serve Him here (Ephesians 3:12).\nHeaven will be beyond our wildest dreams. I don’t know if there will be old dogs, or gumdrops, or cloud-jumping—though I wouldn’t put any of that past our God in His never-ending goodness to His children. Nevertheless, what great comfort it is to know that the Christ who died for us has ascended to heaven and waits for us there. We can be confident, not only of the good things to come, but of His loving, mediating work on our behalf this very day. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: 1 Corinthians 15:1-11, Romans 6:1-11\nThe idea of summer camp has always been idyllic, adorable, and… decidedly not for me. This is probably due to the fact that the mere suggestion of talking before 10am deeply offends me. A morning person I am not.\nThe one time I allowed myself to be sucked into the bizarre vortex of sleep-away camp, a chipper name-tagged counselor welcomed me by shoving my bags onto a mothballed bunk bed and explaining that, for him, the best part of camp was all the cheers.\nAwesome!\nOf course I was fully prepared to fake a pom-pom allergy. But oh-what-bliss to learn that fate aligned those cheering sessions for ALL campers with the rising of the sun each and every morning. And here I was, thinking I would avoid sunrise altogether as per usual. No such luck.\nSomehow, the happy-clappy counselors and campers arose every morning with spirit just surging through their fingertips, while my hands searched for the closest cup of caffeine.\nI was in awe of their energy and became convinced their beds were hiding springs to help propel them from the warm sheets I couldn’t seem to leave. No matter how many times they spelled “S-U-P-E-R” or high-fived for friendship, one thing was clear: cheering was for the morning people, and I was not one of them.\nAfter reading the incredible details about Jesus’ ascension, I’m the first to claim my role as the story’s spectator, taking a step back to watch “The Resurrection and the Life” do His thing. Because that’s what you do with a miracle, right? You stare, applaud—maybe even cheer—and retell the tale to your wide-eyed grandchildren. It would seem our place is to stand in awe and wonder at what it might feel like to suddenly spring forward, being catapulted from death into life.\nBut because His grace toward us was not ineffective, we don’t just marvel at the power of the resurrection; we feel its rumble in our own hearts (1 Corinthians 15:10).\nChrist doesn’t want us to be courteous bystanders of His work on the cross. His hope is not for us to watch and wonder what it would be like to be raised by the glory of the Father. He came so that we could join Him and go wading in the resurrection waters with Him.\nChrist’s eternal transformation isn’t just a miracle to be proclaimed—it’s a change we get to feel and experience. Because we are joined in His likeness, when He is raised, so are we.\n“For if we have been joined with Him in the likeness of His death, we will certainly also be in the likeness of His resurrection… if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him.”\n-Romans 6:5,8\nWe join Him in defeating death.\nWe join Him in a heavenly home.\nWe join Him in grasping grace.\nWe join Him, and He transforms us.\nWe can find ourselves there with Christ in His resurrection, actively walking out the newness He purchased for us. He died and returned to life so that we can too. Christ’s resurrection purpose is to make us resurrected people. \nIf there were ever a reason to cheer, friends, this is most definitely it. May we be resurrected people today, seeing ourselves as we really are: dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Missy Fuller\n\nText: 1 Corinthians 15:12-34, 2 Corinthians 4:7-18\nOne of my favorite songs of all time is Nicole C. Mullins’ “My Redeemer Lives.” I’ll blast that tune from my car speakers, roll my windows down, and scream the lyrics at the top of my lungs. (Okay, I’ll probably have the windows up. I’m the only resident of the greater Nashville area that can’t sing, so yes, I hide behind my windows.) Banging my steering wheel out of conviction, I’m sure I look like I’m singing along to some pop ballad after a bad date. But nope—just praisin’ Jesus!\nI sincerely love this song. It is a faithful reminder of the assurance we have in Christ: our Redeemer lives. Our faith isn’t based on some fleeting idea or passing trend, but on the conviction and confidence that our Savior conquered death and is alive today. \nOur faith hinges on the resurrection of Jesus Christ. If He has not risen from the dead, then He has not conquered death. If He hasn’t conquered death, then death still has power over our lives. Most importantly, if Christ hasn’t been raised, there is no resurrection for us—no hope after death and no eternity with Christ. “If we have put our hope in Christ for this life only, we should be pitied more than anyone” (1 Corinthians 15:19).\nBut the resurrection is real. Jesus did conquer death and rise from the grave. Our Redeemer lives!\nFriends, this is the great treasure Paul spoke of in 2 Corinthians 4—the “extraordinary power” which can only be from God Himself and not from us (v. 7). We carry Christ’s death and resurrection in us—the power of His atonement and the glory of His resurrected life (v. 10). No matter what life brings, our hope is secure.\nIf I’m being honest, I don’t often treat the assurance of Christ’s resurrection like the treasure it truly is. Oh, I live like it’s valuable and worthy and excellent, but the greatest treasure? Sadly, not so much. Instead, I run around, spending my time like this life on earth is the only one I’ve got. I become easily distracted by what I think I need right now.\nBut this life and the things of this world are temporary. They will fade. Our troubles, our pains, our afflictions—they, too, will fade. But our living Redeemer will never die, and His resurrection power will never fade. As Paul goes on to say, “Even though our outer person is being destroyed, our inner person is being renewed day by day” (2 Corinthians 4:16).\nIn Mere Christianity C.S. Lewis wrote, “a continual looking forward to the eternal world is not … a form of escapism or wishful thinking, but one of the things a Christian is meant to do.”\nWe’re meant to live like we know where we’ll spend eternity—because we do! We’re meant to live as though our inner life and resurrection through Jesus Christ is real, both now and for eternity, because it is! We live with confidence in this eternal hope because our Redeemer is indeed alive. He alone is our hope. \n“So if you have been raised with the Messiah, seek what is above, where the Messiah is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on what is above, not on what is on the earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with the Messiah in God. When the Messiah, who is your life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.”\n-Colossians 3:1-4\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: 1 Corinthians 15:35-49, 1 Corinthians 13:8-12\nIf you’ve ever stared at the giant map in the mall, you’re familiar with the red dot. Like a North Star for shoppers, the red dot shows you where you are in relation to the retail world orbiting around you. It has a singular, important message to deliver to cartographically-challenged shoppers like myself: you are here.\nThe red dot is not the destination. No one wants to stay at the red dot, but we need to know where we are in order to figure out how to get where we’re going. The same principle applies to our eternal destiny.\nIf that word “destiny” just caused a switch in your brain to flip to off, flip it back on. Like so many of God’s ideas, the concept of destiny has become distorted.\nForrest Gump said it this way: “I do not know if we each have a destiny, or if we are all just floating around accidental-like on the breeze.” But destiny is not some cosmic tailwind that keeps us from floating willy-nilly. It’s not what we’d see if we could look into a crystal ball. It’s not a future sprinkled with moondust by a fairy godmother.\nOur destiny is simply our destination. \nWhen we think of eternal life, we can’t help but see it through the lens of the temporal (1 Corinthians 15:35). We ask questions like:\nAm I going to look like this in heaven?\nWill people still be married to their spouses?\nWill children still know their parents?\nWill my pets be in heaven too?\nIt’s hard to wrap our flesh-covered minds around eternity. Since we don’t know exactly what life will be like there, we tend to fixate on what life is like here. We park at the red dot, to which Paul’s response is, Don’t be foolish! Where you are now is not where you’re headed (1 Corinthians 15:36-37, my paraphrase). Instead of being the final destination, our current circumstances work like the red dot to orient us toward our destiny. Paul breaks it down for us in verses 42-44.\nOur red dot is corruption, but that’s not where we’re heading.\nOur destiny is to be raised in bodies that can never decay (1 Corinthians 15:42).\nOur red dot is dishonor, but that’s not where we’re heading.\nOur destiny is to be given “the unfading crown of glory” (1 Corinthians 15:43, 1 Peter 5:4).\nOur red dot is weakness, but that’s not where we’re heading.\nOur destiny is to experience the same resurrection power that raised Christ from the grave (1 Corinthians 15:43, Philippians 3:10).\nOur red dot is a natural body, but that’s not where we are heading.\nOur destiny is to spend eternity in a spiritual body, finally set free from the limits and decay our bodies know this side of eternity (1 Corinthians 15:44).\nWhat a hopeful truth! The red dot isn’t the finish line—it’s just the beginning. All of the things that scream, “You are here!” at us today, are reminders that we are destined to end up somewhere unfathomably better.\nThe bodies we’re in now will someday be laid in the ground. But six feet under is not our destiny. God’s Word invites us to lift our eyes and look ahead because where we are now is not where we’re going!\n“For now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror,\nbut then face to face.\nNow I know in part,\nbut then I will know fully,\nas I am fully known.”\n-1 Corinthians 13:12\n\nErin Davis is a popular author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: 1 Corinthians 15:50-58, Revelation 21:1-7\nHave you ever experienced a moment so good, so perfect and pure, that you wanted to freeze time? For me, those moments entail soft sand pressed between my toes, the hot sun hammering down, and the sound of the ocean roaring in the distance.\nMaybe for you, heaven here on earth is something else entirely, like watching your little ones sleep, or having the time of your life with close friends, or curling up by the fire with a good book. There are as many versions of paradise in this world as there are people living here. So it’s really no surprise, then, to see a million different renditions of heaven in everything from art and movies, to books and music, and even in our churches.\nGrasping the mystery of heaven is a challenge, especially when the things of God are too wonderful for us to understand (1 Corinthians 15:51, Psalm 139:6). Art helps us imagine a place we’ve not yet been. But without even realizing it, our view of heaven can be more informed by imagination and our own desires than the promises of God found in Scripture.\nThe season of Lent begins with Ash Wednesday, and for some believers, this includes a church service where ashes are rubbed across their foreheads in the sign of a cross, while these words are spoken over them: “From dust you came, and to dust you shall return” (Genesis 3:19). This act is a reminder of our mortality. But, lest you think Lent is a downer, remember this: the ashes are intentionally smeared in the sign of the cross—the promise of our own resurrection with Christ Jesus (Romans 6:5,8).\nEaster then becomes a celebration of His empty tomb and victory over death, as well as the pardoning of our sin and an eternal paradise spent with Jesus. But what will that promised eternity look like? The passages we read today give us a glimpse at three promises God makes about the new heaven and the new earth that are to come.\n1. We will be changed.\nIn Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians, he emphasizes that we will go from perishable to imperishable, mortal to immortal (1 Corinthians 15:53-54). While Jesus Himself was visibly changed after His resurrection, making it difficult for even His followers to recognize Him at first (John 20:15; Luke 24:13-5), some things remain the same. For instance, the scars a risen Jesus showed a doubting Thomas (John 20:27) indicate that marks of our lives here on earth might somehow exist even after resurrection.\nAs for our own resurrected bodies, Scripture promises us so much more than an ideal weight, a straighter nose, or shinier hair. We are promised resurrected bodies that will never decay—new bodies suited for new life (1 Corinthians 15:42-44).\n2. We will be freed.\nThe apostle John writes that in heaven there will be no death or pain or sorrow (Revelation 21:4). Eternity will be a place where we no longer hurt one another. There will be no more sad goodbyes and no more lists of regret. With no more sickness or hunger, we will be free from the pain that enslaves us here. And in the absence of these burdens, we will be filled with the fullness of joy (Psalm 16:11).\n3. We will be connected.\nJohn also tells us that God Himself will dwell with us in a way we’ve never experienced before (Revelation 21:3). He’s not just creating a perfect forever home for us—He plans to live there with us. We’ll never have to wonder if He hears our prayers because He’ll be more present in our eternal lives than we can imagine. No more feelings of distance or loneliness. In eternity, we will live in the constant face-to-face presence of our loving Father (Revelation 22:4).\nYou and I will never completely understand heaven in this life. But God gives us His Word, and we can read it and proclaim with glad hearts: “We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come” (The Nicene Creed).

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Kings 18:20-40; Psalm 65:5-8; Exodus 12:40-42,51; Exodus 14:21-31; Exodus 19:16-25; Exodus 7:3-5\nSeeing is not believing. \nI ask for miracles all the time. I implore God for snow days, chase after lost causes, and jockey for acclaim. I ask God to change people. I ask Him to change me. And most of all, I ask Him to heal.\nThe possibility of miracles is such lush fruit to my imagination. It means that anything is possible. God could pop down, give a little nudge, and fix any problem. And when He doesn’t, it’s confusing. If He could do a miracle, why doesn’t He do one for me?\nIn preparing for this study, I noticed that Jesus doesn’t do miracles on command. He isn’t anybody’s trick pony. In fact, He blesses those “who do not see, and yet believe” (John 20:29), and He rebukes a generation that “seeks for a sign” (Matthew 12:39). And, man, I do love a good sign. \nIt seems if Jesus were just willing to do a bit of skywriting, all would believe and the world would be saved. It’s so much easier to ask for a sign instead of looking to the person of Christ, to hunt after what He can do for us instead of who He is. His miracles aren’t His message, but rather a testament to who He is. And even those who witnessed His miracles did not necessarily believe.\nThis study focuses on miracles performed by Jesus. But for a big picture, let’s step back and look at all kinds of miracles in the Bible. When reading any scripture, I ask myself, “What is God doing in this passage?” These passages on miracles make it easy to answer that question and learn more about the character of God in the process. \nHe is supreme and omnipresent: God shows His unearthly power when He scorches the dripping-wet sacrifices for Elijah at Mt. Carmel (1 Kings 18). \nHe is sovereign and omnipotent: He is the Master of nature and quiets the storms (Matthew 8:23-27). \nHe is merciful and good: He is the source of our salvation (John 3:16; Hebrews 5:7-10). \nHe is holy and omniscient: He is the thundering presence on Mount Sinai (Exodus 19). \nMiracles are one of the ways God expresses His “otherness” to us. They reveal Him in His power, and show us He is not like us. The rules of nature that bind us do not bind Him. The laws of a created world are amendable by the One who created it.\nAs we read through this study, think about what Jesus’ miracles tell us about His character. Remember that these are nothing less than acts of God performed by Immanuel, “God with us.” Although signs and wonders may not accompany every moment of our lives, the One who makes them possible does.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Why Did Jesus Perform Miracles?",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 11:2-5, Isaiah 61:1-3, John 2:11, Matthew 12:28-42\nMost of us have been there. It’s not just painful, but confusingly painful. \nDidn’t God hear?\nDoesn’t He love me?\nDid I not have enough faith?\nWhy wasn’t it a yes?\nThese are the questions we ask when the miracle doesn’t come.\nPerhaps it was the cancer that wasn’t cured, the chronic illness that never healed, the marriage that couldn’t be saved, or the money that didn’t come through. In the absence of a miracle, these stories about Jesus can be tough to swallow. They can even feel cruel. Why are they here, if not to tease us?\nGod knows we feel this tension, which is perhaps why He included Matthew 11:2-5 in His perfect Word. Here, John the Baptist asks Jesus if He is, in fact, the “one who is to come”—the Messiah. Jesus answers with a clear allusion to Isaiah 61: “Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up” (Matthew 11:4-5). He’s essentially saying, “Yes. All the things that were foretold, I am fulfilling them.”\nJesus’ answer to John tells us a lot about the purpose of His miracles: They are a sign of the prophecies fulfilled, a sign that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah. They are a sign of His authority, His power, and His glory. And they are a sign of God’s love for us, a sign that we can trust Him. \nBut here’s what we shouldn’t miss about Jesus’ answer, because John certainly wouldn’t have. Isaiah 61 also says this of the coming Messiah: He will “proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound” (v.1). It’s a message of hope for prisoners, which is exactly what John was; John received Jesus’ message while sitting in a prison cell. And yet, John the Baptist was never set free. Three chapters later, he’s beheaded. Scripture tells us that when Jesus got word of John the Baptist’s death, “he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself” (Matthew 14:13). \nOur God is not indifferent to our pain.\nMatthew 11:2-5 contains all the power and the glory and the complexity and confusion of Jesus’ miracles. It attests to Jesus’ divine identity, but it also attests to the reality that miracles don’t always come. In this tension, we learn more about what Jesus’ miracles mean.\nJesus’ miracles weren’t only about Him, but about the Kingdom to come. Tucked into every miracle we can almost hear God whisper, “This is what the Kingdom is like. It’s complete healing, total wholeness, freedom, awe, and joy.” Miracles provide a foretaste of this in-breaking Kingdom, but they were never meant to replace it. \nWe’ll never have the perfect peace and restoration we desire this side of eternity, but miracles point to the place where we will.\nWhenever we read stories of miracles, and grapple with their surpassing mystery, we can do so knowing our God is not casual or removed from our pain. Jesus’ very presence on earth reminds us that He entered into it, experiencing the pain along with us. Jesus joined us in waiting for the Kingdom, longing for the day when the need for miracles will be no more. \n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, and mom of two boys.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Colossians 1:15-20, Psalm 77:13-15, Mark 4:35-41, Luke 11:18-23, Matthew 8:14-17\nI once became a vegetarian just because I wasn’t fluent in Spanish. Although I’d never before considered myself a picky eater, a few weeks of traveling in a foreign country taught me that these exotic dishes were a real game-changer. \nOne night, I’d decided to play it safe by ordering the catch of the day. What the menu didn’t specify, however, was that not much had been done since the fish had been caught that day, leaving me with a scaly, slippery dish and two beady eyes staring mockingly back at me. \nThe next night, I knew better. Using my handy translator’s dictionary, I learned the word for “eyes,” and walked into the restaurant with a newfound resilience. \n“Ojos?” I asked with confidence, ordering the chicken this time. \n“No, no,” the waiter responded, chuckling. \nThe dish arrived just as I’d ordered it—no eyes this time, but… there were feathers. Like I was just supposed to put them in my hat and carry on. \nI’m the queen of asking the wrong questions. \nI’ve always had lots of questions about miracles. And if I’m being completely transparent, most of the time it hurts to ask them. Because while learning about Jesus’ healing power and His heart for His people, my questions inevitably turn to, Will He do this for me? or Why didn’t He do this for me? \nHope does not come from belief in power; it comes from trust in a Person. When we don’t understand what Jesus is doing, we must seek to know Him more. \nAs C.S. Lewis said, “Christianity does not involve the belief that all things were made for man.” So our first question needs to change from “What does this say about me?” to “What does this teach me about Jesus?” Or, as Mark 4 says, miracles should cause us to ask, “Who then is this? Even the wind and the sea obey Him!” (v.41). \nBefore we get any further into this miracle-studying business, let that be our default question: Who then is this Jesus? \nHe is the victorious Lord of all (Colossians 1:15).\nHe is Lord over creation (Mark 4:39).\nHe is the One who overcomes evil (Luke 11:18-23).\nHe is the Suffering Servant who bears our infirmities (Matthew 8:17).\nMiracles are breadcrumbs that lead us to the One who answers our need. They themselves are not the prize or the point, because He is already actively both. Miracles teach us that Jesus is God’s glory purposed for redemption. He came to show us His power to heal, but more importantly, to show us we’ve already been healed in Him.\nIf and (inevitably) when I begin to ask the wrong questions, may I look to the fullness of Christ and find that my need for Him is a privilege. May I praise Him for His miracles, but not miss the biggest miracle of all: Jesus Himself. \n“For God was pleased to have\nall His fullness dwell in Him,\nand through Him to reconcile\neverything to Himself\nby making peace\nthrough the blood of His cross\nwhether things on earth or things in heaven.”\n– Colossians 1:19-20\n \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 14:14-21, Luke 5:4-11, John 21:1-11, John 2:1-11\nFood is an unmistakable theme in the miracles of Jesus. There is no aspect of humanity that Jesus ignored, including our need for food. \nJesus ate. He drank. He attended dinner parties—lots of them. The beginning of His earthly ministry included the miracle of turning water into wine at a wedding reception (John 2:1-11). And before He ascended back into heaven, He cooked His disciples breakfast with fish He’d miraculously jammed into their nets (John 21:1-14). In today’s reading, we see that He also supernaturally fed tens of thousands of followers. \nThis helps me to see the practical side of Jesus more clearly. Sure, His supernatural nature is awesome, and we’re keenly aware of our need to see His hand in the “big stuff.” But we tend to whizz right past the fact that He sees and responds to both our extraordinary and our ordinary needs. \nIn Matthew 14, we find one of Christ’s most famous miracles, what’s known as the “Feeding of the Five Thousand.” But this was actually a miracle on a much grander scale. Scripture says five thousand men were present “besides women and children” (v.21), meaning there were likely closer to 15,000 people gathered around Jesus—and He fed every single one of them until they were full (v.20). \nThese were people shot through with grief and sorrow. John the Baptist, one of their spiritual heroes, had just been brutally beheaded (Matthew 14:1-12). At the news of His dear cousin’s murder, Jesus retreated to a desolate place to mourn, but the grieving crowds followed Him, desperate for hope in the midst of hurt, for light in the darkness.\nAs their Maker, Jesus knew the crowd’s deepest needs were spiritual, yet He did not race past their immediate physical needs. In verse 14 we catch a glimpse of a thread that weaves throughout the miracles of Jesus: “When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them.”\nCompassion motivated Jesus to feed the crowds. He satisfied their physical hunger so they could see that He alone is capable of satisfying their spiritual hunger. \nIn Mark 8:1-10 we see that another crowd tracked Jesus down and remained with Him to hear Him teach for three days—without food. If He sent them home, some would faint on the way (v.3). Again, He responded with compassion, meeting their physical needs so they could digest the spiritual truths He desired to teach them. He gave them bread and fish so that they could “taste and see that the Lord is good” (Psalm 34:8). \nPerhaps food is just a tether keeping us close to the truth that we are not our own sustainers. Is it possible that God hard-wired our physical needs into our DNA to teach us of our bigger, constant need for Him? What if every meal were a parable teaching us that Jesus is the Bread of Life (John 6:35), the True Bread from Heaven (John 6:32), the Grain of Wheat (John 12:24), and the Living Water (John 4:10-11).\nJesus’ miracles are never about the miracle itself. They’re about Jesus. He doesn’t intervene in our lives primarily for our comfort, but for His glory, that we would turn to Him. Every last one of our needs points to and is met in Him. \n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 8:22-25, Mark 6:47-52, Matthew 17:24-27, Mark 11:12-14, Mark 11:20-25\nIt’s scary to ask the Lord for specific and even tangible things. \nRecently, our pastor encouraged the congregation to pray more specific prayers. I confess that the moment he invited us into this journey, I began to doubt that God would actually hear my prayers. I usually like to manage my expectations and qualify my prayers with something like, “If it’s Your will, Lord, then…” But our pastor was calling us to more. He was calling us to faith. Since that encouragement, I’ve sought to ask Jesus to do miracles in my own my life. But I fear my faith is lacking.\nI relate to the fear the disciples so often display in the Gospels. They were normal people, after all, just like you and me. Although they walked with Jesus, they still struggled with unbelief (Luke 8:25). And like the disciples, when the storms rage and the winds blow and everything seems unsure in my own life, peace feels far off and unimaginable. \nThe unknown can be scary, but Jesus calls us to something greater than our fear. He calls us to faith. The miracles of Jesus remind us that no matter our circumstances, He proves His faithfulness over and over again. He doesn’t just offer peace—He is Peace. He doesn’t exercise His power over nature—He is Power. \nJesus’ miracles over land and sea are examples of the power and authority He has over the world He created (John 1:1-3). Scripture tells us that Jesus defied gravity by walking on water (Mark 6:49), and that the winds and the waves obeyed Him with a word (Luke 8:24-27). But despite all they had witnessed throughout their time with Jesus, even the disciples didn’t understand. They lacked faith and their hearts grew hard (Mark 6:52). While Jesus didn’t have to reveal His power in this way, through miracles, He did so out of His mercy for them. \nJust as He did with the disciples, Jesus calls us to trust Him in the middle of the storms we face. He asks us, “Where is your faith?” because what’s going on in our doubtful, troubled hearts is important to Him. He gently instructs us to “Have courage!” and reminds us that it’s because of who He is that we don’t have to be afraid (Mark 6:50). The rules of nature don’t apply to Him. The One who spoke creation into existence can also calm it with a word (Mark 4:35-41).\nJesus invites us to trust Him, and I long for the faith to do so. His miracles are for us, too, so that we might see and know that He is Lord. The wind may be howling, the waves may be crashing, but our God is faithful in the midst of it all. By His grace, may we have the courage to trust Him in any circumstance. May we have the faith to call out to Him, to take Him at His word, and to believe.\n\n \nTrillia Newbell is the author of Enjoy: Finding the Freedom to Delight Daily in God’s Good Gifts, Fear and Faith: Finding the Peace Your Heart Craves, and United: Captured by God’s Vision for Diversity.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Luke 8:27-39, Matthew 9:32-34, Luke 11:14, Mark 7:24-30, Luke 4:31-37, Matthew 17:14-21\nIn the preface to his famous satirical novel, The Screwtape Letters, C.S. Lewis writes this of demons:\n“There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them.”\nWhen venturing into the territory of demons and demonic possession, it’s tempting either to write them off as ancient misdiagnoses of mental illness, or to become overly fascinated with them, attributing more power to demons than they have. Either mistake is easy to make because many of us don’t have much experience with them.\nAnd yet, the New Testament world seems to have been filled with demons. There was the demon-possessed man in Luke 8, whose demon went by the name of “Legion.” And there was the demon-possessed man in Luke 11, who was finally able to speak once Jesus cast the demon out of him. There was the Canaanite woman’s daughter filled with an unclean spirit (see Mark 7 and Matthew 15), whom Jesus was able to heal from afar. And there was the boy suffering from demonic seizures in Matthew 17, who was healed by Jesus after the disciples were unable to do so. \nThe list goes on from there, depicting a world quite different from the one we live in now.\nOr was it?\nThe truth is, our world is no less spiritual today than it was 2,000 years ago. Some cultures are simply less accustomed to recognizing the darkness and the various forms it takes. But “our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms” (Ephesians 4:16). The warfare is real and we’re called to engage it. The stories of Jesus’ power over darkness prepare us for this battle by showing us two truths.\nFirst, Jesus has authority over the darkness. In addition to rescuing us from darkness and teaching us how to resist it, Jesus is the King of kings, and there is nothing on this planet or in this cosmos that escapes His royal jurisdiction. As theologian N.T. Wright put it, “[Jesus] isn’t just somebody with good ideas. He isn’t just somebody who will tell us how to establish a better relationship with God. He is somebody with authority over everything that the physical world on the one hand, and the non-physical world on the other, can throw at us. This is a Jesus we can trust with every aspect of our lives.” \nSecond, Jesus exercises His authority with His words. Since the beginning of creation, when God spoke the world into existence, His words have had enormous power. We witness this same power when Jesus banishes each demon with a simple command. New Testament scholar Leon Morris explains, “No magic formulae, no mumbo-jumbo. He just told the spirits to go, and they went. That was what astonished people. He didn’t have to summon up stronger powers than his own; he just used the authority he already possessed in himself.”\nJesus’ power is a comfort to those of us in Christ. We have access to the same power and the same authority (Luke 10:19; Matthew 16:19). In Jesus’ name, we can rebuke the powers of darkness. We should acknowledge these powers exist, but we need not fear them or become preoccupied with them. Instead, let us wield our words with the same intention and precision as Jesus: creating, inspiring, building up, and fending off the darkness.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, and mom of two boys.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: John 9:1-41, Matthew 9:27-31, Mark 10:46-52\nMy preschool teacher was the first to notice my vision problems. Her suspicions were confirmed after an appointment with my eye doctor. I had a lazy eye, but the treatment was simple: wear a patch over the dominant eye to force the weak eye to strengthen. As a budding young artist, I relished the opportunity to draw a gorgeous new eyeball on my disposable eye patch each morning. I can only imagine how ridiculous I looked, but at the age of four I had little concern for appearances.  \nMy eyesight was corrected over time. Not surprisingly, the optometrist never pronounced, “Your faith has healed you!” Rather we assumed modern medicine deserved the credit. My physical sight was nearly perfect, but spiritually I remained blind for many years. \nJesus did not heal blindness the same way an ophthalmologist would. \nFirst of all, your eye doctor has most likely never rubbed mud on your eyes. Secondly, I doubt your eye doctor has ever discussed your spiritual sight. In my experience, she has you look through a metal contraption and asks, “Which looks better, number 1 or number 2, number 2 or number 3?” Surely this is one of the most confusing tests known to man, but it has nothing to do with your faith. \nWhile the multiple accounts of Jesus healing blindness did involve a physical transformation, He always acknowledged a spiritual component. Christ was not satisfied with saving the body; He was even more concerned with saving the soul. \nBlindness and sight, darkness and light—these are metaphors Christ often used to describe the spiritual realm. When He healed someone of physical blindness, it was also a statement regarding His power to heal spiritual blindness. \nPhysical healing is a wonderful gift. But if we only ask for relief from our temporary afflictions, we are not asking for enough. Jesus came so that “those who do not see will see and those who do see will become blind” (John 9:39). His miracle of sight is alive in all who believe because salvation is a miracle of resurrection. Our eyes have been opened; we were dead, but now we’re alive in Christ Jesus. Faith in Him is a gift from God (Ephesians 2:1-5,8).\nWhen God gives us spiritual sight, scales fall from our eyes as they did for the Apostle Paul (Acts 9:18). Our circumstances might remain exactly the same, but our perspective shifts. Where there is hopelessness, Christ offers hope. Where there is fear, Christ offers peace. Where there is hatred, Christ offers love.\nWe are all works in progress. None of us has 20/20 vision just yet. But we know from Jesus’ work on earth that He delights in healing our sight. We ought to pray for physical healing because the Lord cares deeply about our entire well-being. But we should pray also for spiritual sight—the miraculous gift of faith that truly saves us. \n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 5:18-26, Matthew 12:10-13, Luke 13:10-17, John 5:1-15\nThe migraines started in the winter. At times I was dizzy, other times nauseated, but my head was always pounding. In the summer, I sat across from a doctor as he explained that I had a rare, incurable condition called Diabetes Insipidus. Basically put, my body can’t retain water, which means if I drink a glass of water, it travels through my body in about 25 minutes. It’s an endless cycle of hydration, a thirst that’s never quenched. \nAt first, it was a relief just to have an answer. But over time my morale tanked and my body crashed. I found myself using most of my energy just to get the prescribed nine to eleven liters of water into my system each day. There was no cure. No rest.\nWhen I read about Jesus healing the man at Bethesda, I come a little undone. Not because all is suddenly well, but because I can so easily imagine the man giving up hope after living on the fringe of community for so long. What I cannot imagine is thirty-eight years of a broken body. One year has been more than enough for me, and a lifetime is far too much to think about if I want to keep my sanity.\n\nBut here’s the thing that really haunts me: Jesus says to the man, “Get up… pick up your mat and walk” (John 5:8). He tells the man to walk, but He doesn’t just mean physically. There’s always a bigger picture with Jesus. \nScripture tells us a Jewish festival was taking place at that time in Jerusalem (v.1). The healed man was able to attend the feast as a restored member of society, no longer an outcast. During the celebration at the temple, Jesus finds him and says, “See, you are well. Do not sin anymore, so that something worse doesn’t happen to you” (v.14).\nJesus is getting at something much deeper—our sweet Savior is talking about the heart, about spiritual paralysis. He says, in essence, “You think that was bad? There are far worse fates.” Jesus’ charge to walk has a much more significant meaning: to step forward in faith, repent, and believe. The physical healing was never the end of the story.\nWhen faced with long-term devastation, we ache because we feel that horrible tension of longing for better while living with broken. To watch Christ administer miraculous healing to broken bodies in Scripture reminds us that one day, we will all be healed and whole and well. But now, today, we live in both broken bodies and a broken world. \nThere are days when I go a few hours and forget that my body is broken. But there are also days when I feel myself starting to lose my grip—when I look in the mirror and think to myself, Surely, this is going to stop. And it doesn’t. \nSo this is what I do: I take slow, steady sips of water. I take one day at a time. And by His grace, I lean into Jesus, through the long-term illness that keeps me close to Him. When I feel paralyzed by what seems to be both a life sentence and a death sentence, I find that He is ever-present in my struggle (Psalm 46:1).\nJesus beckons to me in my broken, crippled body to “pick up my mat, and walk.” He invites me into faith, into a taste of eternity now in relationship with Him. \n\nMelissa Zaldivar is a social in the world of academics and an academic in the world of socials.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY She Reads Truth\n\nScripture Reading: Mark 1:40-45, Matthew 8:14-15, Luke 14:1-4, Luke 22:50-51, John 4:46-54\nA skin disease, healed. A fever, touched away. A lost ear, quickly replaced. Seemingly chance encounters became life-altering miracles in Jesus’ presence. Power was oozing out of Him, and no one could stop it if they tried, though some certainly did their best.\nSometimes I wonder if, for Jesus, performing miracles was like breathing. Every few moments, my chest expands and contracts, taking in oxygen, transforming it, and putting it out in the world again as a different substance. Jesus inhaled and exhaled, and the blind could see and the lame could walk and the near-dead became fully alive. Lungs breathe because they’re lungs. Jesus heals because He’s the Healer. \nSo why did He reach out His hand to touch the leper? Why did He touch Peter’s mother-in-law to free her body of fever? Why did He touch the high priest’s servant’s ear rather than simply order it to reattach? We’ve seen how He can speak a storm to stillness or fill a net with fish, all without so much as lifting a finger. But time and time again in the Gospels, Jesus chooses to heal by touch. Why is that? \nThe story of the leper in Mark 1 gives us a clue. Read again with me the exchange: \nThen a man with a serious skin disease came to Him and, on his knees, begged Him: “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”\nMoved with compassion, Jesus reached out His hand and touched him. “I am willing,” He told him. “Be made clean.” Immediately the disease left him, and he was healed (Mark 1:40-43). \nDo you see it? It’s love. Jesus used touch to heal because of love.\nIt is the kind of love that looks at an untouchable beggar and is moved with compassion. The kind of love that, with a resounding yes, is willing to enter into our sickness and grief. The kind of love that brims with mercy, that would lay down self and die for literally everyone other than Himself. This is the kind of love only Christ can give. This is the love with which Jesus touched and healed those He came to save. \nTo be in Christ’s presence is to be changed (2 Corinthians 3:17-18). Sometimes that meant physically. Sometimes—many times—Jesus saw fit to make illness and injury disappear like that storm on the Galilean sea. And we have to assume, for reasons we’ll never understand this side of glory, that sometimes He didn’t. Sometimes He doesn’t. But His presence is no less glorious, no less affecting, no less healing if the wound or ailment remains. Love is who He is. Healing is what He does. It’s how and when He heals that’s the question; and that, like so many other things, we must leave to Him (Isaiah 55:8-9). \nBut here’s what we do know: He loves us. He loves us with a love that cannot be comprehended by our limited, yet remarkable, brains, with a love that cannot be conquered by anyone or anything, including death itself. Our illness and injury—be it physical, mental, or emotional—is utterly incapable of keeping us from the Savior’s love. This is His promise to us (Romans 8:35-39).\nWe beg, “If you’re willing, make me clean.” And He always, always answers, “I am willing. Be made clean.”  \n\n \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 9:18-26, Luke 7:11-17, John 11:17-44\nIn Matthew 9, we encounter one of the strangest miracles recorded in the Gospels. \nA religious leader sought Jesus for help. His daughter was near death, and he knew Jesus could heal her. “Come and lay your hand on her, and she will live,” he begged (v.18). Jesus immediately got up and went to the girl, healing a woman along the way. “Have courage, daughter,” He told the woman, then He continued on (v.22). \nWhen Jesus arrived at the religious leader’s house, He made a startling pronouncement to the crowd that had gathered there: “The girl is not dead but asleep” (v.24). And do you know how that lamenting crowd responded? They laughed. We may chastise them in our heads, but can we blame them? The girl was dead, and this man arrived and proclaimed that, no, she wasn’t dead—just napping. \nThen Jesus did what only He can do. He brought life from death. He went into the room, took the girl’s hand, and she got up. The one whose death the crowd was grieving stood up and walked out to greet them, alive as can be. \nMiracles do not fit a formula. There is no incantation, no guarantee for the super faithful. The nature of miracles can be hard to understand on this side of eternity. But that’s okay, because the miracles themselves are not the point. \nIn John 11 we see Jesus raise His friend Lazarus from the dead. But before He does, He pauses for this brief exchange with Martha, Lazarus’ sister:\nJesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”\nMartha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”\nJesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life” (vv.23-25).\nWhen I imagine Jesus speaking these words, I suspect He put an emphasis on the “I am” in verse 25. “I am the resurrection”—as if to pose a direct challenge to the notion that He was merely the means of resurrection, rather than the resurrection in the flesh. Jesus knew the temptation we face with miracles is to desire the gift more than the Giver (John 6:26-27). He was quick to make the distinction. \nThe Gospel accounts of Jesus conquering death seem like the ultimate of all miracles. But really, they were only a short-term (and yes, miraculous) solution to a long-term problem. The only source of real and lasting hope is not a miracle, but the Messiah. \n“I am the resurrection,” Jesus said to Martha. \nAs glorious and dazzling as a miracle can be, it has only an ounce of the power and glory of the Savior. \nThis is the message behind all these earthly miracles we’ve studied: Jesus is better. Christ didn’t simply delay death a little while; He overcame it once and for all. Death has ultimately died. This we know to be true. \n“Have courage, daughter.” In Christ, our hope remains.\n\n \nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, and mom of two boys.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: John 20:11-18, Jeremiah 29:13\nYou know how it feels when you get to the part of your favorite movie where the main character finally has the epiphany you’ve been waiting for over an hour? Your shoulders tense and you hold your breath; you know what’s about to happen but watching it unfold still makes you lean in a little closer.\nThat’s how I feel about these eight verses from the gospel of John. I know the story. I know what Mary Magdalene will find when she looks inside the tomb. I know the identity of the man she supposes to be the gardener. Yet, each time I read the story, I exhale after the same word, every time:\n“Mary.”\nHe spoke her name. The Son of God, now raised from His own grave, appeared first to a formerly demon-possessed woman named Mary Magdalene (Luke 8:2).\nWhy her, do you suppose? Why did Jesus choose Mary Magdalene as the other character in this glorious, theater-worthy scene at the grave? We’re not given the answer, but my heart can’t help but think it is this:\nMary was a seeker. She sought after Jesus.\nShe saw the stone was rolled away, her Savior missing from the tomb – and she went inside looking for Him anyway.\nTwo angels in white greeted her, and a normal person would have run – but Mary went to them weeping, asking for her Lord.\nThen another face she did not recognize, perhaps due to her tears, asked why she was sad – and Mary didn’t even answer the question. She jumped right to the seeking.\n“Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” (v.15, emphasis mine)\nMary was seeking her Lord. She sought Him when He was living, and she sought Him after He died. She sought Him relentlessly, even through the pain and confusion of a freshly broken heart. She did not understand the “why” of what was happening, but she understood this: She needed to find Jesus.\nAnd He spoke her name.\nHe saw her, He knew her.\nShe called for Him and He called back to her.\nThings would be different between Mary and Jesus now. He was no longer her living Lord, He was her living, risen Lord. Everything had changed – for her, for the disciples, for the world –  and Jesus would leave them to ascend to the Father. I can imagine the love with which He told her she must let Him go (v. 17). But something tells me Mary did not stop seeking after she ran off to tell the others, “I have seen the Lord!” Something tells me she sought Him all the more.\nWill we?\n \n \n",

Behind me was a young man, and I decided to buy him whatever he wanted. At first he refused, but with some encouragement he said yes. It was what followed that took my breath away. I got an impression that I was to tell him that God saw him and loved him.\nIn total honestly, I doubted myself and almost moved on to my next activity. But in an instant moment, I turned to him and told him – God sees you, you are known and you are loved. His reaction was tearful and awe-struck as he told me he was desperately wondering if God had forgotten him. As we took a seat at a table, he told me he had been kicked out of his house, was living on pennies and had lost hope in God. We spoke for a few moments and prayed together.\nWhy do we live in the tension of worship and doubt that disables us to share the truth of God’s love? (See Matthew 28:17.)\nYou and I are commissioned – authorized by God – to “therefore go and make disciples” who will know Him and live for Him. This is a commandment from Jesus.\nWe can only do that if we are available and ready for the commissioned moments.\nIt starts with how pliable our heart is to choose worship, choose to deepen our spiritual growth and choose to hear the voice of God. Oswald Chambers says it like this: “Yet you cannot make disciples unless you are my disciple.”\nWe must be tenacious to align with God’s agenda and not ours. When we align with Him, then we can be freely available for the commissioned moments. This is not easy because our self-centered, busy, chaotic life can hurry us to miss those moments. Our doubt and fear of rejection can have us walk away and ignore when the moments present themselves.\nTherefore, we have a minute-by-minute choice to align with God, slow down, trust and believe that the great commission can be lived out at Target, the workplace, school drop-off, athletic fields, grocery stores, the park, a walk with a friend, mission trips to local communities and global nations, in our families, a private conversation on Facebook and, of course, at Starbucks.\nJesus said, “I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” (Matthew 28:20)\nWhat a promise and encouragement that Jesus is with us always! Now, in His power, let’s forge forward to embrace our commissioned moments and nurture discipleship.\nP.S.\nI ran into this young man again in Starbucks. His circumstances had not changed, but he lit up when he saw me. We sat down together over a cup of coffee, spoke about God and prayed together again.\nGuest writer Debbie Eaton is a Southern CA girl who is passionate about the impact of daily influential God moments we have with one another. She deeply values being a follower of Christ, a wife of 27 years, mother of a teenage son, the beauty of friendship, writing, speaking, leadership and a good cup of coffee.

When we jump into this piece of Scripture, we’re coming upon two friends (also disciples of Jesus) who are walking to the town of Emmaus, engaged in friendly conversation. They were heartbroken but expectant, waiting for news of certainty that Jesus had indeed risen from his tragic death.\nThey came upon a stranger who asked what they were talking about, and those two friends accepted this third man and resumed walking and talking. We are told this third man is in fact Jesus, but at the time the two had no idea. Bible commentator Matthew Henry makes note here that we should be encouraged by the fact that where two gather, Jesus joins (Matthew 18:19-20) and a threefold cord is strong and not easily broken (Ecclesiastes 4:12). We are seeing Scripture worked out in life here, two men in community and Jesus shows up.\nJesus not only shows up, but after confirming they are struggling to believe and hold hope, He recounts every Scripture prophesying His coming, dying, and rising. Right there on the road, He tells them just why they should hold out hope and believe.\nWhat an amazing experience these men had. They walked with Jesus, learned from Him, stayed with Him for the night, even broke bread with Him. They begged Him to stay longer before they even really knew it was Him.\nThe men didn’t yet recognize Him as their beloved Jesus, but later talk about their hearts burning when He was reminding them of the Truth (Luke 24:32). One even says that he had never before been so affected by a conversation.\nIs this how we are when we encounter Jesus? Are we encouraged that when we get together with other believers Jesus is also there? When we learn from God, do our hearts burn and are our lives changed?\nDo we continue down the road as a different person because we walk with Jesus?\n\n \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Luke 24:33-43\nHave you ever seen a ghost?\nI have, um, definitely not. We live in a very physical world. We, in a way that is different from the ancient and medieval world, think of the physical world as the only part of the world worth mentioning. I mean, how much would you judge me if I told you I had seen a ghost? I’m not saying it’s not possible, but I reckon you would make a mental note to take me less seriously in the future.\nI’m with Shakespeare’s Hamlet when he says, “There is more in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in your philosophy.” He means that even if I don’t understand everything with my fancy rational mind, I acknowledge that I am small and there is a spiritual world that I cannot fully comprehend.\nSo, when the disciples see Jesus and think: GHOST!, it reminds me how they felt the texture of the spiritual element of the world in a very different way than I do. The ancient mind was more closely tuned to the spiritual; they saw colors, and stars, and water as indicators of spiritual realities. We, instead, see colors as reflected light on the spectrum, stars as gassy balls, and water as H2O.\nAnyway, these guys – these spiritual guys who had seen miracles and walked with Jesus, these guys who Jesus had told He was coming back – they were “terrified” (verse 37). And remember that when The Lord appears to folks in the Bible, the first thing He says is often “Do not be afraid!” (Gen 15:1, Matt 14:27). We are simple and focused on the physical, and when humans are confronted with spiritual forces meeting the physical – it’s scary.\nJesus is where heaven and earth literally meet.  \nIt’s astonishing. It was more than the disciples could handle. It’s more than we can handle.  It’s true and it’s a mystery. Jesus is fully God and fully man. It blows my tiny mind.\nBut Jesus tenderly makes provisions for their terror and their doubt and invites them to touch Him and calm their fears. The awesome God-Man loves and cares for us.\nHe fully understands both the physical and the spiritual worlds. And He is our bridge and connection. It is a beautiful mystery.\n\nGuest writer Rebecca Faires teaches German and theatre, raises four sweet children, and kisses her husband. Hallelujah.\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Luke 24:44-49\nThe disciples had calmed down a bit by now. They’d eaten some dinner, addressed some doubts. Jesus even ate fish right in front of them so they could see His body was real; He was real.\nJesus was back. He’d been killed, He’d been buried, He was dead in a tomb three days, but now He was back. And there He sat, eating and drinking and very much alive.\nIt was time. This was the moment Jesus would lift the veil and reveal to them what He’d always known.\nHe sat back from his plate and began to speak. If I may paraphrase, it went something like this:\nI know the last week has been a little… intense. Me sitting here with all of you must seem completely nuts. But guys – THIS, this is what I’ve been telling you all along. Don’t you see? It’s all happened exactly as the scriptures said it would. The Messiah who would suffer and die and be raised in 3 days? It’s me. It’s always been me. \nAnd you are the ones who’ve seen it all. You’ve had a front row seat to everything that’s happened, and now you get to tell the world! You get to tell them about me, about repentance and forgiveness and grace. You get to tell them about Hope.You have the full message now, and I’m charging you – trusting you – to proclaim it.\nYou won’t be on your own. My Father said He would send you a Helper, and He will. Wait for Him. Don’t go it alone; that’s not the way it’s meant to be. \nSpreading this message is your responsibility, but it is still my Father’s work. Follow His lead.\nSister, you and I weren’t sitting around that table but that charge is for us, too – as are the privilege and the promise. The Jesus who spoke to His bewildered friends over plates of broiled fish is the same Jesus who calls to us wherever we are today. You and I are the ones who have seen it happen – hearts and lives restored and spiritual captives set free.\nYou and I have been given that same message of repentance and forgiveness to proclaim, that same Hope and that same Help. The charge is for us, too.\nWe may not have all our questions answered or our mysteries revealed.\nWe may even be a little freaked out by all we’ve seen and heard.\nBut we sit at the table with the One who knows how all the pieces fit. He always has.\n \n ",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Hayley Morgan\n\nText: John 20:19-23\nGod breathed life into man in Genesis (Genesis 2:7). Without God who created us, we would have no life.\nSimilarly, Jesus breathed on his disciples and they received the gift of the Holy Spirit, which moves in us and gives us new life (John 6:63).\nIt’s this posture of being the created instead of the Creator that allows us to live for Christ. We can do nothing in our own strength; it is the Holy Spirit in us that works and achieves His means. Jesus knew that we would need Peace, and the Holy Spirit is peace. The Holy Spirit brings forth fruits that we could not bear on our own. They are not of flesh, but they are higher than that.\nThe fruits the Holy Spirit grows are love, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23). These things can’t be born out of our dead flesh, just like an oak tree can’t grow apples. But, when the Holy Spirit that Christ bestows in this passage dwells in a person, they have the very Spirit of God within them. When we say, “I no longer live but Christ lives in me” (Galatians 2:20), we are deferring to His glory and His power.\nIf we yield our flesh, His Holy Spirit will grow new fruit we could never have grown ourselves. This is truly a gift because, like salvation, these are not things we could conjure up on our own. A sinful heart does not seek to be good. A wandering heart cannot make itself faithful.\nWhat a gift to be transformed by the Holy Spirit. Jesus is so good to us.\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nText: John 20:24-31, Job 19:25\n“For I know that my Redeemer lives,\nand at the last he will stand\nupon the earth.”\nJob 19:25\nWe’ve talked about Mary Magdalene. Jesus spoke her name and she believed. And then the two men on the road to Emmaus, their hearts burned within them as the Risen Christ Himself opened the Scriptures to them… and they believed. And now we find ourselves in the upper room, where Jesus sits with his disciples, and our beloved Doubting Thomas boldly proclaims:\n“Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.”\n(John 20:25, ESV)\nToday, in the midst of all of the narratives about those who believed and didn’t believe – those who only believed when they touched His hands or clung to His resurrected body, or handled His burial cloths – let’s ask ourselves this:\nWhy do WE believe that Christ was raised from the dead?\nWe have not seen. Or touched. Or kissed or clung or anything actually, genuinely tangible. We are the blessed ones to whom Christ refers in verse 29, “those who have not yet seen and yet have believed.”\nBut why? Why do we follow Christ?\nThere’s an old hymn – “He Lives” – that sings in a chorus of emotion:\nYou ask me how I know He lives?\nHe lives within my heart!\nI’ll be honest, and I hope I don’t offend. That’s just not enough for me. Maybe on a Sunday morning wearing my Easter hat and holding my pew hymnal, but not on a Tuesday night when my world is crashing down, or I’m drowning in doubt, or my head and heart are clouded with temptation.\nI’m going to need more than “He lives within my heart.” You, too?\nWell girls, I’ve sought counsel (I’m so thankful for my pastor!). I’ve sought the Lord. And I’ve assembled these thoughts which I hope will serve to reassure you in your own faith and draw you back to the place they drew me: Lord, I believe! Hallelujah!\n\nFactually, we have before us a host of recorded eyewitness accounts to the resurrection, the empty tomb, and even Christ’s burial clothes. Facts are good, and helpful, so let’s not forget them.\nSecond, we have the disciples’ response. Would these men have committed their lives and ultimately died for a Savior who didn’t raise from the dead himself? The commitment of those closest to Jesus may be the most powerful human evidence to the resurrection. It is impossible to conceive of them dying for something they know was a fraud.\nWe have also been given a host of textual evidences of Old and New Testament promises (death + resurrection and otherwise) fulfilled. The Word of God is trustworthy.\nWe have the growth of the capital-C Church.\nWe have lives changed and the truth that the Gospel is THE story that makes sense of all redemption stories.\nAnd the truth is? Christ did not raise from the dead and leave us alone to figure it out. He left His Spirit. And all that God ever needed to say or will need to say has already been said in His Word, and that same Holy Spirit that Jesus literally breathed on the disciples, is with us – literally with us – now to illuminate and reveal those words for us.\n\nYou ask me how I know He lives?\nIt’s more than a feeling or an emotion. It’s more than factual bullet points. And it absolutely requires faith. It’s a mystery and yet it’s clear as day.\n“To say, ‘I hope so, I trust so’, is comfortable; and there are thousands in the fold of Jesus who hardly ever get much further. But to reach the essence of consolation you must say, ‘I know’. Ifs, buts and perhapses, are sure murderers of peace and comfort… but if I know that Jesus lives for me, then darkness is not dark: even the night is light about me.”\n– C.H. Spurgeon, Morning and Evening\n\n",

When have you experienced a commissioned moment and how did you witness God’s supernatural power at work? Pray and ask God to present a commissioned moment, then let’s share our stories and encourage one another.\nWill you share your story with us today, dear Sisters? Big or small, glamorous or decidedly not — we want to hear how God is teaching you to live out your calling to share the gospel with your words and actions.\n\nHere’s the scoop on how to participate:\n\n\nWrite your devotional/reflections/response to the above question on “commissioned moments” on your personal blog.

Comment there – tell them you see them and hear them!\n**Please share your heart, sisters. Our desire is not for this to be a time of comparison or sizing up writing abilities or spiritual maturity. Eloquence and insight are lovely, but we know that is not the thing our God calls us to. So, let’s not call each other to that either. Sister, if you feel ill-equipped – GOOD! If you feel like you have so much to learn – GREAT. SO DO WE! Every single time we sit down to write. And if we don’t, are hearts are not in the right place.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: John 21:1-14\n“Christ is often nearer to us than we think he is.”\n– Matthew Henry\nThis story of Jesus filling the apostles’ net with fish feels like one of those “normal” miracles (is there such a thing?) that belongs in the thick of Christ’s ministry, back when He was healing the sick and turning water into wine and feeding the five thousand. Instead, we find it here, wedged between the ultimate miracles of His glorious resurrection and magnificent ascension.\nWeren’t there more glamorous encounters to tell? Why not a sermon on Most Important Things before Jesus returned to the Father? This story gives us no quotable lines from the Savior of Man – we get very few words from Him at all, actually. Instead, He reveals Himself by what He does. He gives. \nHe gives Himself. The disciples did not see Him, but He saw them. He was with them, even when they did not know it, like the Helper who would be with them in spirit, always (Matthew 28:20).\nHe gives loving care. He calls them “children” and inquires about their work, as a loving Father would. He is concerned with their concerns, their everyday, their frustrations and their failures as much as their success.\nHe gives wisdom. The disciples must have been frustrated and tired as the sun rose on that boat filled with no fish. Their efforts had amounted to nothing. Jesus gave them guidance. He gave them fish. Only with Him was their work fruitful.\nHe gives sustenance. The fish were already swimming in the lake that day. The breakfast was already cooking on the coals when they reached the shore. The initiative to provide was the Lord’s, not theirs.\nHe gives abundantly. 153 fish – John gives us the exact number. 153 fish in a net that did not break. These minor details are not so minor to folks who fish for a living. His provision was specific and extravagant.\nHe gives apart from merit. All of this He gave without their asking, without their making a case for what was needed or a promise to be better – better fishermen, better followers, better people.\nThe provision was based on grace.\nIt was based on love and mercy.\nIt was based on the very character of Christ, the risen Savior.\nHe provided in such way that “they knew it was the Lord” (v.12).\nHe would leave them soon and there would be much work to do. But in this encounter on the lakeshore, Jesus illustrates that they would not be alone. He would be closer than they think.\nLook around your life. Where do you see the risen Christ today? What needs has He fulfilled that you did not anticipate, did not plan for, did not even know to ask for? Where do you see the fingerprints of His grace and lovingkindness? Sister, He is revealing Himself to you even now, in ways only you can recognize.\n \n",

Do you love me?\nSimon: Yes, you know it.\nJesus: Tend my sheep. Do you love me?\n(Peter is sad)\nPeter: You know all things, you know I love you.\nJesus: Feed my sheep.\nWhen I look at it this way, I’m forced to think about the relationship between these two men and the emotional progression of that moment together.\nThis restoration of Peter is incredibly tender and personal. Jesus confronts Peter about his sin, and here He seems to be alluding to Peter’s three-time denial on the night before the crucifixion. Jesus doesn’t just skip over sin – He addresses it. This is an uncomfortable moment for Peter. By the second “Do you love me?” Peter starts to really try to reassure Jesus. Peter wants to defend himself to Christ and he is hurt to see that Christ doubts his love.\nBut this moment of confrontation and confusion and hurt is Good, because He is Good.\nJesus came to restore us, and to restore us fully. He doesn’t want us to hold on to our pet sins and betrayals, but to surrender everything to Him.\nIn this beautiful and awkward moment, Jesus firmly guides Peter back to repentance and obedience.\nWhen Christ comes to us, He comes for one thing: Christ comes to make us new. He makes us new for His glory! Even in our fearful hesitancy, He is tenderly but irresistibly working to make us what He has called us to be, and He calls us once more, saying, “Follow me.”\n \nGuest writer Rebecca Faires teaches German and theatre, raises four sweet children, and kisses her husband.

It really is that simple.\nThere will be dark days, days when joy feels far away. But, worship is not always sunny and it doesn’t always sound like Contemporary Christian radio. The broken can be holy because it is redeemed. Nothing is wasted or left to rubble in God’s economy, and just knowing that can let in a sliver of light.\nIn this miraculous and unlikely event, Jesus’s ascension, we are reminded again that God does not waste death.
