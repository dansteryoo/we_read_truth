    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nThere was a time when I was afraid to write. The act of etching my thoughts in ink onto a blank page felt like one of the riskiest things I could do—to declare who I am, reveal what’s inside of me, and then slide it across the table for the rest of the world to see. Even now as I type these words on my laptop in the comfort of home, I am prone to second guess every sentence, every word choice.\n\nSure, I like new beginnings in theory, but in practice they paralyze me. It might be a new calendar, an empty room, a first day, or a clean white sheet of paper staring back at me. Like a rookie film actor stumbling onto set, I’m certain I’ll flub the first take. \n\nBut Genesis is another story. It is the story—our story. The beginning of all beginnings, the book of Genesis is the true history of who we are and where we came from. The first book of the Bible, it is our first glimpse of God’s character in Scripture, of His creation and compassion and His covenant with mankind. And though, yes, we humans dove headlong into sin from the first, our faithful, holy, and steadfast Creator remains true. God is the author and star of this story, and He is the one who invites us in to make it our story as well. \n\nThe book of Genesis presents hard truths about human nature and the fallen world we live in, but it is ultimately a book of hope. God created us—each one of us—to bear His image, and He has not changed His mind (Genesis 1:27). Fear and fallenness plague us here on earth, but God will one day bring us home to the perfect peace of His presence. Until then, we are called to “be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it,” to extend God’s plan for Eden throughout the whole earth (v.28). \n\nOne day, we will know and experience our Creator’s presence face to face—in perfect peace, whole, and unashamed—just as Adam and Eve once did long ago (Genesis 1:25; Revelation 22:4). That is the life we were created for, the intimate relationship we were always meant to enjoy with Him. One day, even death itself will die, and we will get the fresh start we’ve always longed for—the perfect new beginning, free from fear. \n\nGenesis lays the foundation for everything else we read in Scripture. Our prayer is that this reading plan serves to draw you further into God’s Word, that it would bring you to a deeper knowledge of the God who made you and a deeper longing for His presence. He alone knows the end from the beginning, and we can rest in Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nWe have a painting in our home, one depicting a distraught Eve being comforted by a pregnant Mary, who is wiping away Eve’s tears. Her eyes focused on Mary’s belly, she reaches out to touch it, even as her own heel is trampling the serpent’s head (Romans 16:20). It’s an achingly beautiful, succinct depiction of what we lost in Eden, and of God’s never-ceasing pursuit to return us to right relationship with Him. \n\nGod’s pursuit of relationship with us is there from the start, in the beginning of His Word. From Genesis 1 and 2, we discover how God formed the earth and everything in it, including man and woman, who He made in His image (Genesis 1:27). He gives Adam and Eve the radical opportunity to rule over the world with Him, cultivating its growth. And out of His relational love for them, He gives them a choice about how they will live and work in this world: will they choose to follow God’s way and His wisdom and instruction for life, or will they choose a different kind of wisdom, one that relies on self-sufficiency and autonomy, apart from Him?\n\nGod has already provided Adam and Eve with everything they need to carry out this task, instructing them on what is good for them and what is not (“the tree of the knowledge of good and evil” [vv.16–17]). Prior to the serpent’s persuasive lie (3:4–5), enticing them to their own brand of knowledge, humanity dwelled in perfect harmony with God and one another. But after choosing to eat from the forbidden tree, “the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked” (3:7). From this point forward, discontent and shame would be a part of the human condition, disobedience would drive a wedge between creation and Creator. \n\nWhen God asked Adam and Eve where they were that day in Eden (3:9), He already knew, of course. It makes me think the question was certainly more for their sake than His—it had to be. He asks where we are, too, all the while knowing all the dark places we run to, the many ways we attempt to hide our hearts from Him. But He pursues us all the same, fully aware that while He will ultimately defeat the serpent, that same enemy still actively seeks to destroy us (John 10:10), to lure us away from the God who adores us.\n\nI looked at that painting again today. We’ve had it for maybe a decade, but to this day, if I look at it too long, it never fails to wake me to the indifference of my own sin, to the lie of self-sufficiency—it wrecks me. \n\nHonestly, that’s where I’m at today. What about you?\n\nIf God were to ask, “Where are you?”, what would you tell Him? Do you believe it’s safe to come out of hiding? Do you trust that our Creator knows what’s best for His own creation? The God of Genesis 1 and 2, is the same God here in chapter 3; He does not change (Hebrews 13:8). He is still in the business of covering our shame with His own righteousness—even when we disobey Him (Genesis 3:21; Romans 5:8,19). Wherever you are, He waits for you.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nMy children are currently in a difficult season of discipline. On a daily basis, usually multiple times a day, I dispense consequences for bad behavior, which are then met with responses of total shock and horror. \n\n“I didn’t do anything!”  “I didn’t know!”  “I didn’t hear you!”  “But his face ran into my fist!” \n\nLike generations of children before them—including myself!—my kids are gifted at playing the martyr. Rather than repent and ask forgiveness, they make excuses. And sometimes, they dig in their heels even deeper. \n\nHere in this story of the very first murder, we see where this blame-shifting began. And it all started very innocently. Two competitive brothers—one a farmer, one a shepherd—bring offerings to God. Cain brings the fruits of his soil, and Abel brings fat portions from the firstborn of his flock (Genesis 4:3–4). At first glance, it would appear that each brother brought what he had, but God does not see it this way. God looks with favor on Abel’s offering, but he withholds favor from Cain.\n\nWhy?\n\nIn their commentary on this passage, Tremper Longman and Scot McKnight explain the difference in their gifts: “Cain offered the ordinary and Abel the best, and of course the quality of their offering reflects the condition of their hearts. Abel is enthusiastic about worship, while Cain is basically disinterested.”\n\nCain is caught doing the bare minimum, but rather than humble himself, admit his spiritual apathy, and ask how he can do better, Cain digs in. He becomes angry. He throws a pity party. He nurses his bitterness until it culminates in murder, and even after all that he continues to play the victim: “My punishment is too great to bear” (v.13).\n\nIn these early chapters of Genesis, we are learning about the ways of God, but we are also learning about the ways of sin, and here we observe a major hallmark. Human sin is so utterly broken that it will even deny its brokenness. It will run, hide, make excuses, and lash out before taking responsibility and repenting, and this is an important thing to know about ourselves. When accountability comes our way, even if it comes harshly or imperfectly, our response determines the course of our lives. How we respond to sin sets our feet on one of two paths: back to God, or further away from Him. \n\nBut here is what else this story reminds us, and I hope this sets you free: sometimes we are the ones being confronted, but sometimes we are the ones doing the confronting. Sometimes, we bring truth to light and then, just like God does in this story, have to watch as a loved one hardens their heart all the more. This, we must remember, is not about us or our shortcomings or how we could have said it better. It’s about sin, and what it does to the human heart. \n\nThankfully, we have something that Cain didn’t have: the Holy Spirit. Through the gift of God’s Son, Jesus Christ, we have a helper and an advocate who is ready to work when repentance feels too hard. That is how good God is—even as He asks us to be faithful, He helps us to do it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nA couple years ago, God called my husband and me to something scary. Ike quit his secure church job with a regular salary and generous benefits to strike out and start a new church. We had no idea how it would turn out, whether we were adequately equipped, or whether it would succeed or fail. But we trusted God, so we obeyed and went. \n\nDuring that season, we relied on a number of stories in the Bible to buttress our faith. Whenever we needed a reminder about God’s gracious willingness to confirm a hard call, we read about Gideon. Whenever we needed to stand on God’s ability instead of our own, we read about Moses. And whenever we wrestled with the loneliness and fear of stepping into a seemingly illogical call, we read about Noah.\n\nNoah’s story is remarkable for two reasons, one which is obvious and one which is not. The obvious reason is Noah’s faithfulness in an unfaithful generation. Genesis 6:1–5 describes an era in human history that was so dark, so depraved, that it prompted God to declare “I regret that I made them” (v.7). The human race was unraveling, and yet there was Noah, “a righteous man, blameless among his contemporaries” (v.9), who managed to resist the moral current of his day. \n\nThis fact about Noah, on its own, makes him an exceptional person. But here is the less obvious, but equally remarkable truth about him: Noah was the first person recorded in Scripture to be asked to take a big leap of faith. To put it another way, Noah didn’t have the heroic stories of God to turn to that we do. No histories of God using the unlikely, or confirming a hard call, or rescuing a desperate people, or most importantly, sending a Savior. \n\nSo when God called Noah to something strange and nonsensical—building a boat, in the middle of the land, with no flood in sight—Noah had little to no record of God’s faithfulness in history. All he had was his own knowledge of God.\n\nBut how did he acquire it? \n\nGenesis 6:9 tells us that Noah “walked with God,” which is an intentionally active verb. He didn’t simply know God; he did life with God. He drew near to God, he followed God, he honored God, and he served God, and this was how he learned about God. He didn’t have a long historical record of the deeds of God, but he wrote one with his own life. \n\nMillenia later, as a people of God who possess generations of stories of God’s faithfulness to ordinary people, the witness of Noah reminds us of something important. As much as these stories are a gift and a help when faith is hard, one of the most important ways we know God’s character and get to know Him more intimately, is not simply by reading about Him. It’s through walking with Him. It’s through obedience. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nRecently, I met with someone who was agonizing over a big life decision. She wanted to make the right choice, and she was terrified of making the wrong one. But her fear was not simply about discerning God’s will. It was about disappointing God. Or worse, failing Him. If she made the wrong decision with the wrong motivation, she worried that God would punish her for it.\n\nThis is, not surprisingly, a common fear among Christians. Many followers of Jesus live with the unsettling worry that God will judge us for our sin, despite receiving His gift of grace and salvation. Either consciously or subconsciously, we operate out of a place of fear rather than love, and it’s often because of stories like Noah and the flood. \n\nThis fear of judgment would be understandable if the flood—or any judgment from God—were the end of the story, but thankfully, it is not. Instead, the flood is only a chapter in a bigger, redemptive plan.\n\nWhat we encounter in the chapters following the flood is a second story of creation. It’s as if God wipes the slate clean and begins again. In the same way God directed Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply, He commands Noah to do the same (Genesis 9:1). Noah is, in some sense, a new Adam. \n\nHowever, what is different from that first creation is the presence of sin. Humanity’s relationship with God has fundamentally changed, which makes this story fundamentally different. He explains what it means to be His people and what He expects of them, but He also promises never to rain down this kind of judgment again (v.11). \n\nGod calls these commands and His promise a “covenant,” which is significant. What God is offering is not a cold, legal “contract,” but a relational covenant that is instituted and upheld by God, and here is why all of this matters: In these opening chapters of Genesis, we are learning about who God is. God is just and He will not be mocked, and we see this in His judgments. But, God is also a rescuer and a redeemer who gives everything He has to deliver us. \n\nIn every story that follows, God affirms these two things: this covenant, and His commitment to preserve His people. And ultimately, He fulfills it in Christ. Jesus receives our judgment and achieves our redemption, and then makes this restoration available to all who enter this covenant through Him.\n\nThat is why we can read these stories of God’s wrath without fear. Sin has consequences and God is indeed just—but the judgment has been dispensed. Because of Christ, God looks upon us in all our weakness and mistakes, and promises, “Never again.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nMy dad is a talented woodworker, and one year he built my brother and me an elaborate treehouse in our backyard. It was the talk of the town. There was a fire escape pole, a sandbox, a gymnastics bar, and a slide. He built it so high it just fit within coding limits established by the California building department. While it may seem like his motivation was a defiance of building permits, it was really an extravagant gesture of love. He wanted our treehouse to be as big and awesome as a treehouse could be.\n\nIn Genesis 11, the motivation for building a really tall tower wasn’t quite as pure. After settling in Shinar, the people were afraid of being scattered throughout the earth (Genesis 11:2). Although God’s command to be fruitful and multiply implies expansion into surrounding lands, the people liked it right where they were. They didn’t want to leave and, instead, decided to construct a tower to “make a name” for themselves (v.4). They likely built a ziggurat—a temple that was supposed to bridge the gap between heaven and earth, a place where they believed they could communicate with the gods. This was a way for them to claim the territory as their own and, hopefully, avoid being scattered. \n\nIn contrast with this story, when Abram received God’s call of pilgrimage to a new land, he responded by building a stone altar (Genesis 12:1–7). Unlike the tower, this wasn’t a symbol of human achievement or possessiveness. It was an offering to the Lord. Although we find countless biblical characters building things—arks, walls, altars, towers—the inner motivation behind these outward acts is different in each case. Some are born out of self-protection. Others out of worship. \n\nIt’s so easy to become possessive, isn’t it? We find something we want, plant a flag in the ground, and we don’t let go. Understandably, we all long for something—a patch of land, a community, a reputation. But our desires can become all-consuming and corrupt when left unchecked. Suddenly, instead of surrendering those desires to God out of obedience, we fight tooth and nail to keep them. \n\nWhatever we’re building, may we work more from a desire to offer it all as worship to God than to protect our own self-interests.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nToday’s reading is packed with action: famine strikes, Pharaoh gets deceived, Abram is kicked out of Egypt. It’s the making of a great summer blockbuster. After Lot and Abram’s respective herdsmen begin quarrelling about their small quarters, Abram sets a boundary. In an attempt to maintain harmony, he gives Lot the hard truth and asks him to separate from the group and make his home elsewhere. “Isn’t the whole land before you?” Abram asks, perhaps with a sweeping gesture of his arm (Genesis 13:9). The surrounding plain of the Jordan River was lush and ready for the taking (v.10). \n\nAfter Lot gets himself in all sorts of trouble, Abram comes through and rescues him. I imagine he was a little agitated by his nephew’s actions, but it wasn’t in his nature to abandon him to his own folly. With the sweat and dirt of conquest still fresh on his clothes, he’s given bread and wine as the priest Melchizedek proclaims: “Abram is blessed by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth” (Genesis 14:19).\n\nWas Abram blessed by God because he was a victorious warrior? A protective uncle? Although, in this case, it may look like blessing is synonymous with circumstantial favor, we have to dig a little deeper. Abram isn’t necessarily blessed because He was delivered from his physical enemies. We know from other passages in Scripture that this predictable, cause-and-effect sort of way isn’t how God works. So, why does Melchizedek give him this blessing?\n\nThe second part of the message the priest brings is “blessed be God Most High who has handed over your enemies to you” (v.20). It appears that Abram isn’t the only one who is blessed—God is, too! Ultimately, God gets the glory for delivering Abram over to his enemies, and it’s His own power and blessing that covers Abram. \n\nJust as Abram was blessed by the God Most High, so are we. Our blessing isn’t dependent on releasing nephews from captivity (although I’d like to think we’d rise to the occasion), but just as Melchizedek came bearing bread and wine, Christ extends His own body and blood to us. When we accept His gift, we enter into abundant life. We are blessed not because of our own merit but simply because He blesses us. Today, let’s carry this story with us as a reminder that God is at work in our lives. Whether in physical circumstances or matters of the heart, He has called us blessed because we are first, and foremost, His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nIn his book, Beyond Words, Frederick Buechner says this: “Here is the world. Beautiful and terrible things will happen. Don’t be afraid.” Buechner is echoing Christ’s words in the Gospel of John, where we’re told to take heart because Christ has overcome the world (John 16:33). There are many times when personal loss makes it feel as if God has removed His provision, and sometimes it takes everything in me not to project the actions of others onto my faithful Father, who has proven His provision in the past. \n\nAlthough today’s passage records God’s covenant with Abram, I can’t help but notice the part Sarai plays in this story. First, she experiences the disappointment of infertility, fearing it to be God’s prevention of her potential family line. She takes action by asking her husband to sleep with their slave, Hagar, to produce an heir. “Perhaps through her, I can build a family,” she reasons (Genesis 16:2). So, not only must she endure her husband’s intimate relations with their slave, but she also grows to resent Hagar after the very thing she hoped for comes to pass—Hagar’s pregnancy. \n\nHer own infertility must have felt emphasized by Hagar’s growing body. I imagine Sarai looking at Hagar and thinking this new life should have her features, her hairline, her DNA. So, what did Sarai really want? Did she want Abram to push back against her plan? Go at it with God? As emotionally complicated as her situation was, in the end, it was only God’s plan that could ease the depth of Sarai’s distress.\n\nThere’s an eerie line in this passage after God reveals that Abram’s offspring will be as countless as the stars. It describes how, after the sun set, “a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the divided animals” (Genesis 15:17). After Abram sacrificed the animals that God requested, this strange apparition appeared. However, God’s presence was often associated with fiery images in the Old Testament, and according to the Faithlife Study Bible, that night “the passage of fire ratified the covenant.”\n\nThere’s a reason God often tells His followers not to be afraid. Famine and battles, new land ownership and elderly maternity, flaming objects that move on their own—these are not things you see every day. But these are the sort of plot twists God delights in using to develop trust in His people and further His kingdom. Still, He understood how alarming all this must have been for Abram and consoled him by saying, “Do not be afraid… I am your shield” (v.1). \n\nDo not be afraid, friends. God is our shield. Before taking matters into our own hands, let’s believe that God is for us, not against us. Let’s give Him the benefit of the doubt and wait for His redemptive movement in our lives (Romans 4:20).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nFour years ago, the university where I was working went through financial difficulties and laid off several recent full-time hires. I was one of them. It was devastating since our team was like a close family. After reestablishing financial stability, they extended an offer to come back one year later; and because I was juggling part-time gigs at the time, I accepted. Here’s the crazy thing: it was a far better role than before and wound up being the closest thing I’d ever had to a dream job. The experience led to one of those moments when you think: I sure wouldn’t want to go through that again, but I’m so happy things worked out the way they did. I couldn’t wait to share the good news with my family and, like Abram, say in amazement: “Is anything impossible for the LORD?” (Genesis 18:14). \n\nIn Genesis 18, both Abraham and Sarah laugh after the Lord says they’ll have a son in one year’s time. What a crazy claim! Being in their autumn years, how would they have the strength and endurance to raise a child? Abraham responds by laughing to himself and asking if a hundred-year-old man and ninety-year-old woman can have a baby (Genesis 17:17). It’s a legitimate question. But God isn’t even close to being done working the miraculous into Abraham’s story. \n\nGod came through for them. He gave them a son, demonstrating it had always been His intention to further their family line. And the story didn’t end there. God not only chose to make Abraham a father, but also the father of many nations and the root of Christ’s lineage (vv.4–5). It wasn’t about how tired or advanced in years the couple was now; it was about the kingdom. \n\nThe reason why it’s so important to remember how God worked for our good in the past is because it anchors our trust for the future. My story didn’t have to end with returning to that university, just like Abraham and Sarah’s story didn’t have to end with a male heir. God could shape us and build His kingdom in a million different ways. In the end, we’re left in awe and wonder, laughing and marveling, just like Abraham and Sarah. \n\n",

Toward the conclusion of the film adaptation, we see the Pelennor Fields lying in smoky ruins after battle. It’s a scene of utter and complete destruction. I remember watching this scene for the first time, wondering as the camera panned out if there’d be a familiar character still alive among the wreckage. I wanted to see a remnant of the good guys, to know that mercy had been shown to at least one person. Or hobbit. Or elf.\n\nMany of us hear words like “grace” and “mercy” and immediately jump to Jesus and the New Testament. But since we know that Christ is “the exact expression” of God’s nature (Hebrews 1:3), it won’t do to consider God in the Old Testament any less gracious or merciful.\n\nGod’s mercy is not hard to find in the Old Testament. It’s woven throughout the book of Genesis like a flowering vine, connecting the stories in Christ’s lineage. Even when people continue to make bad decisions that bring about their own demise or widespread catastrophe, God’s desire is for people to be saved (2 Peter 3:9). We see the ultimate display of God’s mercy in His Son, Jesus Christ; through the power of His resurrection, there is healing for the world (Isaiah 53:5). \n\nDuring his exchange with Abraham, God listens to Abraham’s plea and gives the people a chance. “The LORD said, ‘If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake’” (Genesis 18:26). They continue to talk, and that number of fifty is reduced to only ten (v.32). But sadly not even ten can be found. God still saves Lot—Abraham’s nephew and the familiar face Abraham knows and loves. God’s mercy is always there and greater than we expect, even when most people reject it.\n\nWithout Christ, it’s our own hearts that resemble that plain of smoking ruins. Even after receiving the Holy Spirit, we still wrestle with sin. We routinely choose to submit to our own will instead of the Spirit. Our sins may not seem as flagrant as those of Sodom and Gomorrah, but we are all sinners in need of grace. \n\nHallelujah! Christ has broken the curse of sin and death. Even now, Christ—the exact expression of the Old Testament God with whom Abraham bargained and pleaded for the lives of his community—invites us to accept the gift of eternal life. He is for us, and His mercy is greater than we think. Remembering this, may we echo Abraham’s plea for the redemption of our own hearts, our city, and our world. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nI’ve never been pregnant. I’ve come to terms with the fact that, like Sarah (or Rachel or Hannah) in the Bible, I have been given the burden of infertility, a weight that I’ve kicked and railed against and sobbed about and finally, dutifully picked up—mostly because I had no other option. I don’t know if I will ever have a child born from my own body, but I know that if I did, I would join right along with Sarah in laughing. \n\nGod’s timing is perfect, and sometimes, pretty funny too. To think, Sarah had waited her whole life to have children, and only once her family was in disarray, did God choose to follow through on His great promise. After everything that happened, why now? Because when she was at her weakest, once again, He showed His great strength.\n\nThe Bible is full of humans, not heroes. We see in Genesis chapter 20 a story of fear, when Abraham tries to hide and protect his wife Sarah by claiming that she was his sister, only to nearly cause a massive tidal wave of destruction for Abimelech. What follows in close succession is Sarah finally giving birth to the child God promised: Isaac.\n\nBut even amidst the laughter and celebration, a shadow hovers over this family. After all, they didn’t wait patiently for God to follow through on His promise. Earlier in their marriage, Sarah encouraged her husband to have an affair with Hagar in order to bear a child. Now, she can’t fully enjoy God’s faithfulness, because the proof of her unfaithfulness is right there, mocking her, at the party. \n\nAre we any different? When God is good to you, what do you focus on? Are you wholeheartedly clinging to His goodness, or do you still see, out of the corner of your eye, glimpses and reminders of your own sin, lack, and shame? After all, how good can He really be? We see the answer in the second half of chapter 21.\n\nEven when Sarah sends Hagar and Ishmael away in a fit of rage, God continues to be good to them. He is loving and saving and kind—because that is who He is. It doesn’t matter if you see yourself as a promised child or a child whose background is questionable. None of this is conditional on who we are or what we’ve done, but rather on who He is and what He accomplished on the cross. \n\nGod’s promises always come true. He has promised to forgive our sins and guide our hearts, leading wherever He pleases (Proverbs 21:1). He promises to give us everything we need for life and godliness (1 Peter 1:3). He promises to come for us, and not to leave us as orphans (John 14:18). The Lord did for Sarah all that He had promised. The Lord will keep His promises to us as well. That is who He is. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nI really didn’t want to be assigned this passage. I’ve been a Christian most of my life, and still, when I read this passage about Isaac and Abraham walking up the mountain, I simply want to throw my Bible across the room. Why in the world would God ask Abraham to do this?\n\nThere are a host of things that God asks His people to do—things that, without faith and understanding of context surrounding these passages, seem really wild. Earlier in Genesis, God asked Abraham to circumcise every man in his household, even his servants. Today, Christians are asked to live in obedience to a lot of biblical commands which make no sense to the world and its culture today. We’re asked not to have sex outside of marriage. We’re asked to think of others as better than ourselves. We’re asked to go out of our way to give to and love others—even our enemies. These commands might seem obvious if you’ve been in church for a long time. But outside of the lens of faith, they really make no sense at all. Only God can give us the strength and faith needed to obey Him. \n\nAnd so, I’m left to believe that God must have given Abraham the strength and faith to obey even this—this seemingly insane command. Why would God have Abraham sacrifice this child, who he and Sarah had waited and longed for throughout the course of their lives? Why this child of the promise? If you remember Genesis chapter 21, you’ll recall that Abraham had just sent his other child, Ishmael, away. So now, if he were to go through with the sacrifice of Isaac, he would have no children at all. \n\nBut Abraham trusted God. He trusted that God was good. Abraham had learned that obedience to God brings greater blessing than pain. So, if God was asking him to surrender to something painful—something as horrific as losing his only son—then there must be an even more abundant blessing on the other side.\n\nI’m not sure I would have had the faith to walk up that mountain. But because Abraham obeyed, we now get to witness, through Scripture, the first example of substitutionary sacrifice, as God provides a ram in the thicket. Do you know who else walked up a mountain that led directly to an inconceivable sacrifice? Jesus.\n\nOnly when Jesus walked to Calvary, when the Roman guard slammed hammer into steel, through flesh, there was no ram in the thicket (Genesis 22:13). Jesus, the King of kings and Lord of lords, became God’s autobiography on earth. And God’s nature is not punitive—it is sacrificial. Jesus willingly obeyed the Father to the point of death—even to death on a cross (Philippians 2:8). And because of His supernatural, unexplainable, indescribable obedience, we now have peace with God. Thanks be to God for obedience and the peace that comes with it—things that we may not be able to understand, but can only pray to the strength and faith to emulate. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nIn 2009, I moved to Nashville to take a job at a middle school that had no central heat or air. That summer was hot, and I spent day after day in my new classroom, cleaning out closets stuffed with books, mice feces, and dust. By the end of my first week in a new city, I was exhausted, friendless and scared that I’d made a huge mistake in taking this job. \n\nThat weekend, a friend reached out and invited me to a concert with a group of friends. “This guy Patrick is planning it,” my friend told me. “Here’s his number.” Maybe I was desperate for new friends. Maybe all that time in an airless classroom made me bold. But I called, and a man with a deep, soothing voice answered the phone. Patrick and I talked for a long time. When we met later that night, I saw in his eyes something familiar and kind. Much to everyone’s surprise, we were engaged five months later. People thought we were crazy, and for the record, let me say this: we were.\n\nIsaac and Rebekah have an even crazier origin story. Camels, water troughs, long distances across foreign lands, prayers to God—all accumulated to create an arranged marriage between two people whose lives God would use to change the course of history. Their story is full of the kind of inexplicable coincidences that help us see God’s hand at work. I mean, what are the chances that Abraham’s servant would arrive at this well, at this hour? He asks her for water, and waits to see if this young woman will offer to quench the thirst of his camels as well. He’s searching for kindness, for goodness, for industrious character. And he finds it in Rebekah, the very first woman he meets.\n\nWhat are the chances?\n\nAs a Christian, I believe that God is constantly at work, guiding His people in the way they should go. Scripture tells us that “a person’s steps are established by the LORD,” and that “all [our] days were written in [His] book” (Psalm 37:23; 139:16). “We are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works which he prepared in advance for us to do” (Ephesians 2:10). These are comforting truths when things seem to be going our way, but not so much when our circumstances seem to go awry, veering off into an unexpected direction. But even then, God is our protector, who never sleeps or slumbers (Psalm 121:4). He is always engaged with our lives, whether we realize it or not. \n\nAnd so it was with Isaac and Rebekah. Their story reminds me that God builds unlikely families, restores broken relationships, and heals us from what seems irreparable apart from Him. He promised to build a family through Abraham and his descendants, a family line that would eventually lead to the Messiah, our Savior Jesus, who was born into this world to redeem His own Bride, the Church. \n\nAfter pursuing and finding a bride for Isaac, his servant “knelt low [and] worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD,” the God of Abraham (Genesis 24:48). Jesus Christ pursued His own Bride, even to the point of death on a cross. May our response be to turn to Him in worship, thanking Him for His faithful love and mercies that never end (Lamentations 3:22–23).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nWhen I was seven years old, my family went to Disney World. At the time, we lived in Virginia, which meant that in order to get to Space Mountain, we had to drive from the D.C. area all the way to Orlando. To survive an eleven-hour drive with three daughters under the age of fourteen, my parents came up with a plan. They told us that when we got to Disney World, we would all get $50 as spending money, but that any misbehavior during the drive would lead to a deduction from that amount. And so the drive began.\n\nA few hours later, their plan had backfired. Rather than sitting quietly, trying to maintain our $50 allowances, my sisters and I had devised a game of our own, in which we attempted to provoke one another into losing more and more of their allowance. Anytime one of us misbehaved, my mother would take out her notepad where she was keeping track of deductions. While one sister sulked, the other two would pull down an imaginary lotto-lever and shout “cha-ching!” \n\nWe weren’t all that nice to one another. But our misbehavior pales in comparison to the sibling rivalry recounted in the story of Jacob and Esau, twin brothers who came out of the womb as enemies. And their parents were no help. From the beginning, Isaac and Rebekah chose favorites, and that favoritism only stoked the enmity between these brothers.\n\nAt stake in this passage is Esau’s birthright, the inheritance he stood to receive as the firstborn of his family. Knowing the value of that inheritance, Jacob plotted against his older brother, as if land and money were a finite resource. Meanwhile, Esau didn’t place adequate value on his birthright. He was “immoral and irreverent,” selling “his birthright in exchange for one meal” (Hebrews 12:16). Know this: favoritism and strife is not God’s plan. In fact, the Mosaic Law will later forbid a father from favoring a younger son merely because he comes from a preferred wife (Deuteronomy 21:15–17). But for now, we see that Jacob uses the means at his disposal to manipulate his way into wealth. \n\nGod is not interested in breaking up families over dollars and cents. Perhaps the greatest problem with Jacob and Esau’s behavior is that they both forgot God’s character. They forgot that the same God who blessed Isaac also blessed Ishmael. God never runs out of goodness. He does not “dock” us for misbehavior, nor will He look favorably upon those who provoke others into deceit. God’s goodness exists equally for His dearly loved children. We know this, because Jesus calls us His friends (John 15:!5). \n\nJesus, the most favored Son of all, gave us the right to become His brothers and sisters, His co-heirs to the kingdom (Romans 8:17). He is willing to share the blessing. He knows there is more than enough blessing to go around.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nThis morning, I opened up Facebook to discover that a celebrity picked my friend’s book for her highly influential book club. Rather than experience a surge of excitement for my friend, I felt the sinking pull of sadness. I didn’t even pause for a moment to feel happy for my friend; instead, I rushed to despondency, dejection, defeat. One question screamed loudly, over and over again in my mind: Why not me?\n\nPeople have plenty of conversations these days about the dangers of comparison, but I rarely hear the “j” word: jealousy. Jealousy is dirty. It’s dark and venomous and seeps into my consciousness like poison. In those moments, I’m not just wishing I had it better; I’m wishing that the other person had it worse. Yikes. I try to swallow the sadness—I leave a comment, I say congratulations—and I mean it… eventually. But my initial reaction isn’t charitable or kind. \n\nMy heart’s natural posture isn’t to hope for the blessing of others; it’s to hoard every good thing for myself. I have to keep that ugly truth in mind as I read today’s passage. I’m not all that different from Jacob. And if I had the chance to skew my future for the better, I might just put on some goatskins too. \n\nThe rivalry between these brothers, stoked by the favoritism in their parents, creates a toxic ripple effect that flows out for many generations. In yesterday’s reading, Jacob entrapped Esau, and Esau stupidly traded his birthright for a bowl of soup. In today’s passage, Jacob schemes with his mother Rebekah to steal even more from Esau: his father’s blessing. Words are powerful, but these aren’t just words. When Isaac speaks a blessing over Jacob, he’s passing along a divinely ordained covenant with Yahweh. He’s telling the family secret. He’s bringing Jacob into the Abrahamic covenant, and essentially saying, “Through your family, God will redeem the world.”\n\nI have to wonder why Rebekah was so adamant that Jacob become the favored, blessed son. Maybe Esau was not that bright? We know he traded a huge inheritance for a bowl of soup. We’re told his wives were a thorn in Rebekah’s side. Maybe she saw that Esau’s poor choices could negatively impact the future. But no matter what her reason for favoring Jacob, her methods to secure his position were totally wrong. She offers no directness, no honesty. She initiates no difficult conversations. Her only tactics are manipulation and deceit.\n\nThe Bible is full of humans, not heroes. And yet, God still fulfills His promises to His people. Despite the fact that Jacob is a master manipulator, God continued to work out His plan through these sinful people, moving history ever closer toward a Savior who could save us from our jealousy, our deceptions, our fears. \n\nJesus lived a perfect life. He didn’t have to scheme to receive anything, because He created everything. And yet, for the joy set before Him—including an eternity spent with you and me—He endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God (Hebrews 12:2; 1:3). And now, we have a brother in heaven. And He is the best brother, because He wants to share the gifts of His family with us (Romans 8:16–17). He hoards nothing.\n\nEven when I am faithless, He is faithful. Even when I am jealous, He is there, ready to forgive and put salve on those self-inflicted wounds. Even when I scheme to build my own earthly kingdom, Jesus gently turns my eyes back to the city with eternal foundations—the one built by God, and shared with me (Revelation 21:7). \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Jacob Deceived",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nMy family recently subscribed to a new television streaming service, one that walks me down memory lane with beloved after-school TV shows and movies that I watched as a kid. Revisiting those stories, and sharing them anew with my daughters, has been so much fun.\n\nNarratives shape us. Good stories can awaken our desire for eternity, reminding us of the good in the world, while lifting the veil on the darkest parts of the human experience. \n\nI think the story of Jacob and his two wives, sisters Leah and Rachel, checks all of those boxes. It is a story brewed in brokenness and stirred with deceit, envy, and deep sadness. As a kid, I thought it was so very sweet, a little like a fairy tale: How romantic that Jacob loved Rachel enough to work for seven years to marry her! \n\nBut revisiting the story as an adult unlocks deeper truths about what I’m reading. Laban used his power to deceive Jacob into fourteen years of labor. Leah was cast aside and considered ugly, while Rachel gloated over her favor with Jacob—that is, until Leah bore sons, while Rachel could not. What a desperately sad story about two broken marriages, rival sisters, and a deceptive uncle who repeatedly manipulated his kin for profits. \n\nJacob was deceived. Leah was rejected and unloved. Rachel was emptied out by envy. Laban saw profits instead of people. \n\nWhen Leah bears Jacob’s sons, she names them Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah. With each son’s birth, she hopes that Jacob will love her. But by the time Judah is born, she seems to relent and refocus her affections on her God, saying, “This time I will praise the LORD” (Genesis 29:35). \n\nBetween Leah and Rachel and their servant women Bilhah and Zilpah, Jacob had twelve sons. These twelve sons would go on to be the patriarchs of the twelve tribes of Israel, and from the tribe of Judah, Jesus would be born. This son of the unloved wife would lead to the birth of the Messiah, who would bear the weight of every broken relationship. \n\nThe sad twists of this story lead us to look forward to the cross, because it is the only lens that allows us to see the grief and sadness that come from broken relationships more clearly. And yet, the good news of Jesus doesn’t change what we feel when we are mistreated, deceived, or utterly distracted with envy. \n\nEach of those scenarios tears at our relationships with other people, inevitably causing us to see people as less than the image-bearers God created us to be. We wound and are wounded. People become objects, wrong sources of our happiness (like Rachel was to Jacob), transactional sources of labor and economic gain (like Jacob was to Laban), or they make us the victim of our own disordered desires (like Rachel did to Leah). \n\nBut Jesus takes all of that–every objectifying, victimizing, heartbreaking, manipulative, broken interaction–and instead, offers us perfect healing and a gospel-paved way to reconciliation. As we read on, Jacob will experience total reconciliation with his brother Esau. While not every relationship experiences that kind of healing in this life, as we seek to treat other people the way Jesus treats us, we can lean on the shared gift of the gospel to be the common ground of grace. It is all we have to offer. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI love this story. I think it’s because somehow I missed it growing up, and when I read it as an adult, it moved me to tears. I remember hearing the part of Jacob’s story from the end of Genesis 32, where he wrestles with God, but I’d never really heard his story from chapter 33—and this story has a happy ending. \n\nWe don’t actually get to say that very often about many stories in the Bible, and certainly not the stories in found in Genesis. In fact, every story about Jacob leading up to this one hasn’t necessarily been fun to read. Following Jacob’s narrative, we see that he chooses to collude with his mother in order to steal the birthright from his older brother Esau. He goes on to be deceived into marrying a woman he doesn’t love. And he is exploited by his father-in-law, Laban, forced into years of servitude. \n\nIn Genesis 31, Jacob begins to journey back to his home where he will meet his estranged brother, Esau. In stealing Esau’s birthright, Jacob wronged his brother terribly. And now, he brings his wives, children, and livestock on a journey to meet him again. He packs up a massive gift offering, trying to win Esau’s affections (or tolerance) with whatever he can give. \n\nHere’s the stunningly beautiful, perfect portrait of God’s free grace to us: Esau runs to Jacob, embraces him, and says “I have enough, my brother… Keep what you need” (Genesis 33:19). Esau’s reaction moves me to tears and makes me want to shout out in celebration—all at the same time—because this story is a picture of what God offers me. Their reconciliation is just a foretaste of our own reconciliation with our God: a redeemed relationship that we cannot buy, we cannot earn, and we cannot lose. I have wronged God. Apart from Christ, I was estranged from Him. Everything that Jacob did to Esau, I have done ten times over to everyone I know. \n\nI can imagine myself before Him. I’m trembling as I hold out my “good deeds” as an offering to Him, a way to make our relationship right, and He responds by telling me He not only has enough—He is enough. \n\nGod provided redemption through Jesus for His children, and His work on the cross is enough to cover every sin. Jesus secured the redemption of those who believe in Him. And the Holy Spirit seals us for the day of redemption, when we will live with God forever. Thanks be to God!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nAfter being married just three years, my husband and I moved away from the city I grew up in, all our friends, our families, and our church community. We left to attend graduate school in a state five hours away, which isn’t really that far, but in the post-move shock of everything being so painfully new, I struggled mightily.\n\nTwo years later, we moved again, closer to home in proximity and yet every day we felt further and further away from relationship. While we now had a baby, I still had no friends, which left me a particularly unhealthy combination of angry, sad, and lonely. In the end, we limped home in a moving truck with a baby who had just learned to crawl. And as I stood there in our new apartment, finally holding the keys in my hand, I wept. God had called us back to the place we had ached to be for so long. \n\nIn Genesis 35, God called Jacob home to Bethel, where He had first appeared to him. In Genesis 28, Jacob saw a stairway to God in a dream. And God made him this epic promise: “I will give you and your offspring the land on which you are lying… All the peoples on earth will be blessed through your offspring” (Genesis 28:13–14). In response, Jacob named the place Bethel, declaring, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it … What an awesome place this is! This is none other than the house of God. This is the gate of heaven” (vv.16–17). \n\nSo when God called Jacob back to Bethel after many years away, Jacob reacted immediately. First, he told his family to purge their homes of any idols to false gods, promising to build an altar to worship the God who had been there in his “day of distress” and “everywhere” he had since gone (Genesis 35:3). When Jacob returned to Bethel, God gave him the new name of “Israel” and promised that both nations and kings would descend from him (vv.10–11). Jacob would set up an Ebenezer, a stone marker to remember and celebrate the Lord’s faithfulness in all circumstances.\n\nIn his hymn “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing,” a twenty-two-year-old Robert Robinson declared:\n\nHere I raise my Ebenezer;  Hither by Thy help I’m come;  And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,  Safely to arrive at home.  Jesus sought me when a stranger,  Wandering from the fold of God;  He, to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood.\n\nBecause of Jesus, we can claim the same promise of an eternal home, the door opened for us by His person and work on the cross. And we can pray, thanking, celebrating, and remembering the promises He has made to us in His Word, and that ultimately, our forever home is with Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nThe ugliest moments of my life have been marked by jealousy. It is perhaps my most defining sin, and it masquerades as pride, fear, insecurity, and relationship-crushing meanness. Envy dehumanizes everyone around me; it removes their own agency as creative, talented, smart image-bearers of God. I no longer see them as their own persons, but rather as measuring sticks for my own worth. Too often, I think, I’m better than so-and-so at that, but nowhere near as good as that other person. If jealousy is my economy, cynicism and narcissism are the currency I trade. If that sounds harsh or out of proportion, it’s not. I think that jealousy and envy are the root of most conflicts between people, and unadmitted jealousy festers and slowly destroys relationships. \n\nEnvy is threaded through the Bible, a throughline of sin from Cain and Abel, Rachel and Leah, Saul and David, the pharisees who watched Jesus draw crowds to Himself, and more. In history, art, and literature, examples are rampant. In Shakespeare’s Othello, Iago cautions Othello about such envy: “Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy! It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on.”\n\nJoseph is the victim of his brothers’ jealousy, which robs him of his family, his home, his dignity, and almost his life. His brothers strip him of his robe and would have killed him, but sold him to a band of traders instead. It was perhaps the equivalent of death in their eyes: they expected to never see him again, and delivered the news of his death to their father Jacob. \n\nAs modern readers, we know how the story goes: Joseph trusts the Lord, and the Lord protects him. He rises to power in Egypt and eventually saves his family from famine and forgives his brothers. But the moment we read about today in Genesis 37 doesn’t have any of that goodness— only pain. And by not reading ahead, we can force ourselves to sit in the devastation wreaked by Joseph’s brothers. Jacob mourns the loss of his son and cannot be comforted. Joseph is sold again, this time to an Egyptian official. No longer in control, Joseph has lost all agency at the hands of his jealous brothers. \n\nThis is that same “green-eyed monster,” and throughout Scripture, we are warned against its fallout. Proverbs 14:30 cautions that “a tranquil heart is life to the body, but jealousy is rottenness to the bones.” Ecclesiastes 4:4 tells us that “all labor and all skillful work is due to one person’s jealousy of another. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.” And James 3:16 advises that “where there is envy and selfish ambition, there is disorder and every evil practice.” \n\nScripture certainly doesn’t hold back about the consequences of jealousy, and neither should we. As I read about Joseph’s story, I’m aware that I should “let it read me”: Where is my jealousy hurting people that I love? Where is it corroding my heart and sowing disorder? Where is it disordering my priorities away from Christ and toward my own selfish gain? These are important questions to ask because jealousy isn’t something to be taken lightly. My prayer is that I never will.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Judah and Tamar",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nGenesis 38 breaks into the Joseph narrative with a bold, complicated, very broken story. Joseph is sold into slavery, and the very next verse we read is about his brother Judah. Judah was one of Leah’s sons, and Leah the wife that Jacob didn’t love. Judah was also the patriarch of the lineage of King David and Jesus. So this story, and Judah’s legacy, isn’t as much an interjection as an interlude that gives us a glimpse of God’s grace and the amazing ways His promises were fulfilled despite all sorts of human interference. \n\nSome cultural background helps this story, because it’s a rather tangled web of relationships. Levirate marriage was a practice in the ancient Near East that was later codified in Deuteronomy 25 as part of the Mosaic law. Basically, it meant that if a man died before he had a child, his brother had to marry his wife, and their first child would carry on the first (dead) brother’s name and place in the lineage. \n\nJudah had three sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah. Er married a woman named Tamar, and Er was so evil that he died. Onan married Tamar, but didn’t want to preserve his brother’s place in the lineage, and so he did not impregnate Tamar, and was killed for that sin. Judah had seen both of his sons die after marrying Tamar, so he hid Shelah away and kept him from Tamar. \n\nTamar, the widow who had the right to bear Judah’s eldest son’s child and continue the family line, responded. She dressed as a prostitute, tempted Judah, and conceived a child with him without him knowing who she was (Genesis 38:13–19). Later, when Judah found out she was pregnant, he threatened to kill her for adultery (against Shelah, whom she was technically betrothed to). When she revealed that Judah was, in fact, the father, he then admitted that he had wronged her. Tamar had twin sons, Perez and Zerah, and Perez continued the family line and his descendants included King David and Jesus. \n\nThat is a lot of background to unpack a story that is, at its root, a story of God’s faithfulness to a family. God had made a promise to Abraham. He made a promise to Isaac and to Jacob. And at so many turns, the promise appears threatened by someone’s sin. Judah almost destroyed what he should never have had in the first place: the blessing of the line of Christ. \n\nBut the author of this very complicated story is the Author of the ultimate story: the story where God wins, where His promises all come true, and we are given the free gift of grace purchased on the cross by Jesus, the Son of God who came to earth as a baby in the line of Judah. God can and does redeem the hardest, most impossible, most complicated stories. What a gift it is to be His.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Joseph in Potiphar’s House",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nAt first glance, Joseph’s story reads like a set of extraordinary circumstances lived by an ordinary man. If that’s the case, it would be enough to hold our collective attention for a moment, but not one second more. So why is it we are still talking about him?\n\nJoseph was the favorite son of Jacob (Genesis 37:3). You may have heard of his coat of many colors, or perhaps the time his brothers sold him into slavery (vv.3, 27–28). Joseph stood firm against the temptations of Potiphar’s wife, even though doing so landed him in prison. (Genesis 39). He’s the one who relocated the baby nation of Israel to Egypt and protected them from eventual famine (Genesis 47). \n\nThese are the facts we see on the surface, but look again. There is an undercurrent to Joseph’s story that points to a deeper truth. We see it written all over Genesis 39. We read that the Lord “was with Joseph,” and when his master realized this, he also saw that “the LORD made everything he did successful” (vv.2–3). The Lord remained “with Joseph and extended kindness to him,” blessing “the Egyptian’s house” and making everything he did successful (vv. 5,21–23). It’s clear that while on a human level Joseph’s life was marked by betrayal, fear, and desperate circumstances, on the supernatural level, his story is about so much more—because of God’s favor. \n\nWhen Joseph’s brothers plotted his death— God preserved his life.\n\nWhen the schemes of man made Joseph a slave and a refugee—God gave him favor in a foreign land. \n\nWhen he was falsely accused and thrown in jail—God infused Joseph’s prison time with purpose. \n\nWhen there was no way for Joseph to free himself from his shackles—God set Him free. \n\nWhen Joseph was cut off from his family—God made a way for radical reconciliation. \n\nWhen Joseph lived in a land of famine—God filled his storehouses. \n\nJoseph was a nobody. Just an overlooked kid with a string of bad luck. Nothing to see here—but God. God was using the circumstances of Joseph’s life to tell a bigger, more important story: the story about His glory. \n\nGod’s story of grace is the undercurrent of our lives too. He proves His own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). He remains faithful to us, even when we are not (1 Corinthians 10:13). He is “rich in mercy, [and] because of his great love that he had for us, made us alive with Christ even though we were dead in trespasses. [We] are saved by grace!” (Ephesians 2:4–5). \n\nThe reality of God’s grace turns every moment of rejection, every false accusation or overlooked achievement, every fear and every famine, into an opportunity to showcase His glory. He is the point—not us. Thousands of years later, we are still compelled to remember the story of a shepherd boy turned slave, who was transformed from a prisoner into a man of great power—not by Joseph’s strength of character or accomplishment, but by God’s design and power. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nOf all the drama and intrigue contained in Genesis 41 and 42, these four words capture my attention the most: “after two whole years” (Genesis 41:1, ESV). Joseph sat in a foreign prison, innocent of the crimes he was accused of committing—for two whole years. That’s a long time to wait for your rescue, a long time to wonder if a savior is coming, a long time to pray for God to come through. Except, on God’s redemptive timeline, it isn’t. When God decided to restore Joseph, it happened in the blink of an eye: “Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit” (v.14). \n\nThough I know the stories in God’s Word aren’t about me, I can’t help but identify with Joseph. I’d go all in on the bet that you can identify with him too. Here we sit, longing for our rescue. We’ve got heartaches and breaks we want mended. We’ve got needs we cannot meet for ourselves. We’ve got broken bodies, broken homes, and broken cultures. There are times our fallen world feels like a prison. In Christ, we have been made new (2 Corinthians 5:17), but it doesn’t always feel like it. We are still waiting for complete deliverance from our brokenness, and we have been waiting our whole lives. And yet… “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet… the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:52).\n\nWhatever it is that you’re waiting for God to do, whether you’ve been waiting two years or two decades and even when the wait feels like it will last forever, there is hope worth holding on to. Someday, when Christ returns for His bride, we will exchange prisons for the fullness of His presence, pits for His perfect peace. \n\nThe wait often feels like it’s lasting too long—except, on God’s timeline, it isn’t. Watch for Jesus with hope that is rooted in expectation, knowing that the wait, no matter how long, will not have the last word.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by geodes. They’re unremarkable on the outside; to the untrained eye, they just look like rocks (often ugly ones). But crack a geode open and you’ll find your breath has been taken away. Each one is filled with a tiny city of crystals that shine and sparkle in a spectacular variety of colors and formations.\n\nThere are many geodes in Joseph’s story, moments that are unremarkable at first, even ugly. But as the Bible cracks each one open and all is revealed, our breath is taken away by the beauty God brings about in the midst of the ugly and unremarkable.\n\nOne geode is the silver Joseph snuck back into the sacks of his brothers. Genesis 42 records: “Joseph then gave orders to fill their containers with grain, return each man’s silver to his sack, and give them provisions for their journey. This order was carried out” (v.25). For Joseph, this was a moment of generosity. He opted to give blessings to the brothers who had taken so much from him. But to the brothers, who could not scrub the blood of their brother from their hearts and hands, the money was a curse, highlighting their sin and guilt. \n\nThere are both blessings and perceived curses in our lives. We think we can distinguish the difference between the two. Blessings look and feel good. Situations that seem to be cursed, in our limited, human perspective, do not. But what if blessings and burdens are in cahoots? What if God can use the seemingly unremarkable and ugly parts of our lives to reveal His goodness and provision?\n\nWhen the famine forced his brothers to return to Egypt a second time to purchase grain for their hungry families, it was the silver in their sacks that brought them back to Joseph. Without money to return, surely they would have avoided the foreign ruler who imprisoned them, kept their brother Simeon, and ordered them to bring him their beloved baby brother. But once the geode was cracked open, deep beauty was revealed. \n\n“Then the steward said, ‘May you be well. Don’t be afraid.  Your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your bags.  I received your silver.’ Then he brought Simeon out to them” (Genesis 43:23). \n\nThey returned the silver, and brought their brother Benjamin to Joseph, and Simeon was returned to them. But look again. Standing in their brother’s presence, reconciliation was possible. The family was reunited and brought together to live in the thriving nation of Egypt.\n\nLook again. Crack open another geode. The events of Joseph’s story set the stage for Israel’s later enslavement by a new Pharaoh. That moment of history is ugly, but look at how God continues to work. Israel’s deliverance through Moses, the Passover, and the parting of the Red Sea. Keep looking. Keep cracking. From the nation of Israel came our Savior whose birth seemed unremarkable and death was horrific, but whose sacrifice granted us salvation—the greatest treasure of all. \n\nThere is no way to know the riches God can bring in the ugly, rocky places of our lives. We can trust the treasure is there and that in His timing, beautiful, sparkling gems will be revealed.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nSometimes the language of Scripture is so tender, I’m tempted to look away. We find such a moment in Genesis 48. When Jacob sent his favorite son on a simple errand to check the family pasture, that son, Joseph, was barely out of boyhood. Scripture tells us he was just seventeen years old (Genesis 37:2). But Joseph never came home. Jacob believed the story his other sons told him, that his favorite boy was dead. He must have mentally buried all of his hopes for Joseph’s future. \n\nIn the unbelievable providence of God, Jacob was reunited with his boy. But Joseph wasn’t a teenager anymore. The son Israel lost now had sons of his own, and Israel’s hopes for his boy were suddenly resurrected. You can almost hear the wonder and surprise in his voice when he looked at his grandsons for the first time and asked, “Who are these?” (Genesis 48:8).\n\nIsrael wasted no time on icebreakers. Seeing your children taken and returned has a way of cutting through the trivial. “Bring them to me and I will bless them,” he said (v.9). Scripture describes Jacob as a tired old man, with eyes that didn’t work like they used to (v.11), but he had seen enough in his life to know to hold his blessings close. Knowing this, these words in particular from this interaction put a lump in my throat: \n\n“Then Joseph took them from his father’s knees and bowed with his face to the ground… then [Jacob] blessed Joseph and said…  ‘the angel who has redeemed me from all harm— may he bless these boys’” (vv.12,15–16). \n\nThe image of Ephraim and Manassah sitting on their grandfather’s knee pulls every string in my heart. There’s such tenderness in this moment. Such precious, paternal prayer. The words of blessing Jacob spoke over his grandsons weren’t grandiose. Though Jacob wrestled with God to secure his own blessing (Genesis 32:22–32), for the next generation, he sweetly whispered “bless these boys.” It was a prayer God certainly answered—a prayer God is answering still. \n\nYou don’t have to strongarm God to get Him to listen. Brute force is not the secret to praying with power. Lift your babies onto your knee. Grab a friend. Pull her close. Simply ask God to bless the ones you love. \n\n",

He wrestled with God and walked with Him. \n\nThere is typography to all of our lives, highs and lows, peaks and valleys, times when God’s blessings flow like roaring rivers, and times when they seem like a barely trickling brook. Each individual moment, experience, or circumstance is just a snapshot; only God has the 10,000 foot view. And at every elevation, He is wooing us back toward home. \n\nThough Israel met the love of his life and experienced smashing success in Haran, he never stopped thinking about Canaan. Though his children and grandchildren put down deep roots in Egypt, he never shook the pull of home. After calling them to himself to offer one final blessing over each of them, he gave instructions for his own burial—not in Egypt, where Joseph was interred, but with his forefathers, in the cave found in a field, in the land of Canaan (Genesis 49:29–30). He told them: “This is the field Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hethite as burial property. Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried there, Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried there, and I buried Leah there’” (Genesis 49:29–31). Israel wanted to rest with his people.\n\nWhether we are in a moment of success or failure, whether we find ourselves deeply rooted or adrift, whether in the highest of highs or the lowest of lows—our hearts ache for our true and future home. There is a longing, placed deep inside of each one of us, not for the land of our fathers, but the land of the Father. We know, deep down in our guts, that eternity with Him is where we belong. \n\nIsrael’s ache exists in each one of us. Like him, we want to know that we won’t have to stay forever in this foreign, broken land. In every peak and every valley, we can cling to this hope: in Christ, our homesickness will be satisfied. Someday soon—it won’t be long now—we, too, will be carried home. \n\n",

And here, as Israel stands on the edge of the last leg of their journey to the Promised Land, He promises that His faithfulness will continue.\n\nListen to these phrases of certainty offered by both God and His newly appointed servant, Joshua, over the span of just 18 verses (emphasis mine):\n\n“I am giving [this land to the Israelites]” (v. 2).\n\n“I have given you [every place your foot touches]” (v. 3).\n\n“Your territory will be [where I’ve appointed it]” (v. 4).\n\n“I will be with you” (v. 5).\n\n“I will not leave you or forsake you” (v. 5).\n\n“You will distribute the land I swore to their fathers” (v. 6).\n\n“You will have success” [as you heed all of My instruction] (v. 7).\n\n“You will prosper and succeed” [when you observe My Word] (v. 8).\n\n“God is with you wherever you go” (v. 9).\n\n“You will be crossing the Jordan” (v. 11).\n\n“God is giving” [this land to you] (v. 11).\n\n“God will give you rest” (v. 13).\n\n“God will give you this land” (v. 13).\n\nAs profoundly complex as the situation seemed, it was also profoundly simple: God was keeping His promise, just like He always had and just like He always will.\n\nIsrael got the message, and they responded in kind: \n\n“Everything you have commanded us we will do, and everywhere you send us we will go. We will obey you, just as we obeyed Moses in everything” (v. 16-17, emphasis mine).\n\nIf you’ve read ahead, you know how this story ends. The God of Israel was completely faithful to His people. They did cross the Jordan, and they did take possession of the land He’d promised their ancestor Abraham 450 years earlier. You may also know that Israel did not hold to the “everything” and “everywhere” they’d promised. Yes, they followed Joshua. They heeded his instructions to prepare, to remember, to go (v. 11-13), but their faithfulness was only partial. Like a sieve, obedience slipped through the holes in their good intentions.\n\nTheir faith was not perfect, but God’s Word and faithfulness did not falter. \n\nThis Bible we open together today makes some bold promises. These are not fortune-cookie promises to be read one moment and tossed into the takeout bag the next. These are holy promises. These are true promises (Psalm 19:7). \n\nWhen we believe on Jesus Christ, we will be saved (Romans 10:9).\n\nThrough the gift of His Holy Spirit, Christ will never leave us (Matthew 28:20).\n\nBy His death and resurrection, Jesus has taken on our sin and granted us His righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21).\n\nWhen God says “I will” and “I have,” He will and He has. \n\nPraise the Lord, His faithfulness fills in the cracks of our obedience! Praise the Lord, we can walk with courage and confidence into the certainty of a tomorrow where God will never leave us or forsake us. Praise the Lord that as co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17), every foot forward is another step on the journey of coming home to a place we’ve never been. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Joshua Sends Spies to Jericho",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Joshua 2:1-24, Joshua 3:1-17, Numbers 13:25-33, Hebrews 11:31\n\nWe’re in that phase of family where at least one, if not all three, of our children end up in our bed by the time the sun comes up. At some point in the night one of the little people in our home will inevitably wake. Rather than rolling over and going back to sleep, he or she will stand up, drag his or her sleepy self down the stairs, round the corner into our room, and climb into our bed, right between my husband and me.\n\nOther than the growing amount of room they take up in our comfy bed, there’s something else I’ve noticed about this nightly ritual. Our comfort-seeking kiddos always crawl in our bed and lie down facing their papa, every single time. Whether the culprit is a bad dream in their heads or a raging storm outside the window, their response is the same: they face their father.\n\nI love the juxtaposition of the stories we find in chapters 2 and 3 of Joshua. Two very different stories of God’s children choosing to face and follow their holy heavenly Father in the face of impossible circumstances. And in both situations, He proves Himself worthy of their unabashed trust and holy fear.\n\nRahab, a woman known primarily by her sin, met the one true God in a precarious time in the history of her homeland. She’d heard the stories of God’s stunning faithfulness to His people, and she knew they were coming to possess the land. Her neighbors were frightened by the evidence of His greatness; in Rahab’s own words, they were panicked (Joshua 2:9). But a different kind of fear was taking root in Rahab. She was coming to fear the Lord.\n\nBelieving the God of Israel was “God in heaven above and on earth below” (Joshua 2:11), Rahab risked everything to offer refuge to the two spies sent by Joshua into Jericho. In a culture of faithlessness, she dared to face full-on the holiness of God and follow Him in a bold act of faith. Later, her family would be spared because of it (Joshua 6:17).\n\nIsrael had seen God’s rescue not from afar but up close. When Joshua said to them, “The Lord will do wonders among you tomorrow,” they knew he meant it (Joshua 3:5). So Israel faced the ark of the covenant, which symbolized the very presence of the Lord (Joshua 3:10-11), and moved forward to take possession of the “land flowing with milk and honey” (Numbers 13:27). Even following the ark among the masses required faith. Surely the people remembered the time the scouts reported back to Moses, Aaron, and all of Israel that the promised land was inhabited by a people impossible to defeat. “They are stronger than we are!” the scouts cried out (Numbers 13:31). But they were not stronger than Israel’s God.\n\nIsn’t this what it’s like to follow the Almighty Lord? Sometimes, like Rahab, you walk the road alone, stepping out on nothing but faith and a holy fear of the God who rescues His people. Sometimes you move with the masses, direction clear as day, but a nagging doubt nonetheless. What if we aren’t strong enough? What if we’re defeated? Then the God of the impossible dries up a riverbed for your feet to walk across, just as He did when your wilderness journey began (Joshua 3:17; Exodus 14:22). \n\nFrom impossible to impossible, the road of faith is under the command of our sovereign God, beginning to end. A people with an impossible future and a harlot with an impossible past—both fixed their eyes on the only true God and neither were beyond the reach of His rescue.\n\nNo situation is beyond the sovereignty and strength of our God. He is the God of Abraham, of Moses, of Joshua, of Rahab. He is the same—yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8). Fear Him in His awesome glory. Face Him in His limitless compassion. Follow Him wherever He leads, no matter the scene to your right or left. Fix your eyes on His presence and His promises.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Joshua 4:1-24, Joshua 5:1-15, Exodus 25:10-22\n\nI think I have a super-nose. It has twice identified dangerous fires in the nick of time, once diagnosed an ear infection in a baby, and can always sense any change in my husband’s morning ablutions. The poor man can’t wash his face with a different soap without my nose sensing the difference. I’ve learned never to ignore a smell because scents yield up so much valuable information.\n\nOur sense of smell also delivers when it comes to evoking memories. I learned to depend on smell when I was still young, so when I found myself in a moment that I wanted to impress on my memory forever, I used a scent to anchor it. Over time, I amassed a rolodex of lotions and perfumes that I used as markers for memory; I needed only to breathe in the scent to remind me of those treasured days. The smell of lime conjures up the peak of the Kahlenberg looking over the Danube River, and the smell of strawberry reminds me of our first apartment.\n\nPurposeful, intentional memory building is not my own clever invention; God used markers in the Old and New Testaments to memorialize significant moments in the lives of His covenant people. Just like the Israelites, we are “forgetful hearers” and we need help remembering God’s past faithfulness and His future promises (James 1:25).\n\nIsrael had both God’s promises and His faithfulness to remember, and their escape from Egypt was bookended by two unbelievable river crossings: the Red Sea and the Jordan River. God taught them to remember by establishing an equally unbelievable monument. He commanded twelve men to heave giant river stones out of the muddy riverbed on their shoulders and carry them to shore. They muscled these stones into an heavy pile. As the slimy green algae dried on the rocks, they stood back, wiping their hands, to look at what they had done, and saw an impossible, otherworldly monument. These were rocks from the very bottom of the Jordan River. They never should have been seen, and yet, because God miraculously stopped the river, they were stacked on the shore as a reminder of God’s impossible miracle for generations.\n\nThis unlikely mound of river rocks was a testament and a signal that this was the end of an era. No more would they be wilderness wanderers; they had finally come home. “And the day after they ate from the produce of the land, the manna ceased. Since there was no more manna for the Israelites, they ate from the crops of the land of Canaan that year” (Joshua 5:12). God underscored the end of their travels by putting a stop to the manna. They could set up homes, and grow their own food on their own land.\n\nAs they settled in to this wonderful home they had never known before, it would have been easy to forget how they got there. Their legendary victories were only achieved when they walked in obedience, and their devastating failures were a direct result of failing to obey God. The people of Israel were inclined to forget the source of their help, and we lean right with them in that same direction.\n\nEven as we set up memorials, using the power of sight and smell and our other senses to remember our lives, Joshua drives us to remember those old and sure memorials of God’s faithfulness. Israel’s epic victories were not undergirded by their own doing, but by God’s faithfulness to His promises. \n\n“In the future, when your children ask their fathers, ‘What is the meaning of these stones?’ you should tell your children, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’ For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over. This is so that all the people of the earth may know that the Lord’s hand is mighty, and so that you may always fear the Lord your God.”\n– Joshua 4:21-24\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Joshua 6:1-27, 1 Kings 16:34, Colossians 2:11-12, Exodus 3:1-6\n\nMost people move into a retirement community later in life, but I’ve been a part of one since birth. My dad has always been in the business of caring for the elderly, and as a result, I’ve gained some serious benefits—mainly, a personal cheering squad. They are always up for a competitive card game or impromptu ice cream cone, and never forget to tell me how tall I’ve gotten. And boy, do these people know how to throw parties. I’ll never forget the Bon Voyage party we had for the chapel. \n\nYou see, the community was going through a huge, exciting expansion—new office buildings and homes going up left and right. There was just one problem standing, quite literally, in the way of those new plans: the community’s beloved chapel, the centerpiece of the campus. Instead of letting the bulldozer run its course, the community decided to uproot the chapel from its original location and transfer it to the other side of the property. There, it could continue to be enjoyed for years to come. \n\nThe day of the move, my parents let me miss a few hours of the second grade to witness it. We stood under the porte-cochere, eating cream cheese bagels while the community band warmed their bagpipes and trumpets. Surrounded by dirt piles and construction hats, it was hard to miss the shocking upheaval of the chapel’s uprooted foundation. Still, there was much to celebrate. The chapel itself, the very place where this community had regularly recounted God’s faithfulness, remained safe and sound. \n\nIn our reading today, we’re entering a different construction site together, one filled with its own upheavals and unknowns. The broad-shouldered city of Jericho is fearfully closed to the Israelites—no one goes out, no one comes in. Under the Lord’s direction, a curse is imposed on the city and its idol-loving inhabitants when Joshua and the priests begin to march around it. Carrying the ark of the covenant, they keep in step with God’s commands and watch as the walls around Jericho fall at their feet. \n\n“The people advanced into the city, each man straight ahead, and they captured the city. They completely destroyed everything in the city with the sword—every man and woman, both young and old, and every ox, sheep, and donkey.”\n- Joshua 6:20-21\n\nGod gave them the city. \n\nNow, I don’t know about you, but I’m not sure how I’m supposed to feel about this. Yes, justice was served. Yes, the good guys prevailed. And yes, God’s perfect plan unfurled as He’d promised. But that doesn’t change the fact that they were standing in a destruction zone, does it?\n\nSitting with the truth of crumbled walls and a city destroyed, I cannot help but wonder what this says about God. We readily cozy up to God’s promises of love, restoration, and peace, but what do we do when His promises include curses, death, and brokenness? \n\nWe trust Him still. From where we sit, it’s hard to understand the mind and ways of God (Isaiah 55:8-9). But the just consequences of sin do not lessen the sovereign goodness of our God.\n\nAt the intersection of God’s wrath and mercy, we find two constants: His kept promises and His unfailing love. To trust the fullness of His character, we need Him to be steady and sure. In chapter 6 we encounter God’s faithfulness, not only in the midst of a crumbling Jericho, but also in the protection of Rahab, who became part of the lineage of Christ (Matthew 1:5). \n\nBecause of who He is, we can always stare into the dark unknown of destruction to find an unchanging God. In the midst of every upheaval and replanting, He is faithful.\n\nPraise the Lord for every promise kept. \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Israel Cannot Stand Alone",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nText: Joshua 7:1-26, Joshua 8:1-35, Deuteronomy 9:26-29\n\nWho of us has not lamented like Joshua, beating our breasts and rending our garments, surveying the landscape of darkness, rebellion, and fear in front of us? Many of us have fretted that God’s name will not be made great, but all too often we say, “What can we do to make Your name great?” Joshua, praise God, got the pronoun right: “What will You do for your own great name?” (Joshua 7:9, emphasis mine).\n\nIt’s strange, the knots we tie ourselves up in, the puzzles we struggle to fit ourselves into, the efforts we put forth to be the bringers of greatness to God. We want to be the world changers and the history makers, the people of God for God, with nothing standing in our way. But Joshua, in the face of Israel’s abundant sin, knew if God’s name was to be great, He Himself would be the one to do it—not man. \n\nWe think the world will be changed by our short-term missionary journeys, fiery sermons, and quippy books. We think we can bring glory to God’s name with our efforts of authenticity, by racking up social media “likes” and “followers,” by planting new churches, both big and small. We think we’ll glorify Him by performing awesome acts in His name and creating large gatherings for prayer and praise—by centering most things on the gospel, and relying on great graphics to take care of the rest. \n\nBut in Joshua chapter 7, here is how God chose to make His name great: \n\nJoshua lines up the twelve tribes.\n\nWithin those tribes, the clans.\n\nWithin those clans, the households.\n\nWithin those households, the men.\n\nThen one man: Achen.\n\nTo him, Joshua says, “My son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make a confession to Him. I urge you, tell me what you have done. Don’t hide anything from me” (v. 19).\n\nAnd here, among an entire nation, Achen is found out and then tells the truth: “I have stolen and I have hidden what I have stolen, and here is where it is” (vv. 20-21, my paraphrase).\n\nBut God already knew Achen and his actions. He knows ours, too. \n\nWhat if the way God chooses to make His name great is the difficult, relentless, painful, and excruciatingly long process of unearthing sin in our lives? What if the way God makes His name great is not through public acts of piety, but private acts of repentance? What if His greatest act of glory is in exposing the darkest of lies our hearts have clung to, only to replace them with the light of His mercy and Truth? \n\nAs Charles Spurgeon said, “It is far easier to fight with sin in public, than to pray against it in private.”\n\nToday, as you read this passage, do not ask how you can do great things for God. Instead, ask Him to unearth the secret sins in your heart, the places that need exposure to His light and healing in His presence. He knows them already and loves you still.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Joshua 9:1-27, Joshua 10:1-15, Ephesians 1:18-23\n\nNothing makes me hustle like a deadline. Seriously, mention one in conversation and I’ll be unable to hear you over the clock that starts ticking in my head. \n\nIn college, I worked for the school newspaper. The building was underground, beneath the university’s basketball court, filled with the sounds of screeching sneakers and jammed printers. Sleep was replaced by a steady stream of caffeine and adrenaline, while stories forcefully flowed out of our fingers to be placed in the hands of our readers a few short hours later. \n\nWe basked in the knowledge that news couldn’t become news without us. Everything was under our watch, from the latest rumors to the biggest announcements. The fluorescent hallway beams created a false sense of time, as we hibernated under the security of to-do lists and grammar rules. In the morning, we’d climb the stairs of reality, the latest issue in hand, to welcome the day. Before opening the door, we’d make bets on whether the sky would be dark or light, because we honestly couldn’t tell the difference from our journalism bunker. \n\nIn chapter 10, Joshua faces a firm deadline with a pretty serious agenda: save his people from the attack of five powerful kings. It’s a bleak situation until the Lord says, “Do not be afraid of them, for I have handed them over to you. Not one of them will be able to stand against you” (v. 8).\n\nIf God were to assign a project and a deadline to me, I imagine I’d descend the the stairs to the newspaper office and begin strategizing my next move, emerging with a plan in the morning. But that’s not what Joshua does. \n\nJoshua asks God to make the sun stand still, giving him time to fulfill the mission at once. And God does it. The sun stops in the middle of the sky, delaying its setting almost a full day and giving Joshua the time needed to accomplish His task. \n\nAs I think about what a sight this must’ve been, I can’t help but realize that, if it were me, I’d still be underground, oblivious to the stilled sun. Even worse than missing that newsworthy spectacle, I’d miss out on observing the intimate care of my Creator. \n\nWhile I no longer work for the newspaper and now spend most of my time above ground, I haven’t completely graduated from my own knee-deep ambition. I collect my cares and hide away from the very God who fought for Israel! But I don’t want to spend my days strategizing. I want to get busy living like God has called me to live. \n\nMay we ask the Lord for a faith like Joshua’s, boldly believing that God is in our corner. Let us stand and walk and live in the sunlight, knowing He is for us.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Joshua 10:16-43, Joshua 11:1-23, Psalm 110:1-7, Ephesians 1:3-14\n\nI only watch action movies for the romance. You know, the love subplot, where the guy-and-girl tale is interspersed between all the scenes of war and gore. Battles don’t interest me, nor do bomb explosions, car chases, guns, or swords. No matter the era or context of the film, something in my brain shuts off when the action picks up, and then that something turns back on to watch love rise from the rubble.\n\nWhen reading Joshua, I find myself doing much the same thing. I’m tempted to glaze over the battle scenes, the names of the countries conquered, and all those kings’ names I can’t pronounce. Until I get to the “good stuff,” I tune out, then tune back in once I get to… well, Psalms.\n\nBut something interesting happened as I was reading over this week’s passage. At first, I only saw scenes of conquest, of Israel taking each and every enemy in its path—Makkedah, Libnah, Lachish—a slew of battle scenes depicting how God’s people took over the north and south territory of Canaan. However, as I read the passage again, I began to see that, in the midst of all the action, another plot emerges.\n\nThese verses are more than a retelling of conquest and victory. We see this when we pay attention to the repetitive language in the text—language that emphasizes God’s devotion to Israel:\n\n“And the Lord also delivered [Libnah] and its king into the hands of Israel” (Joshua 10:30).\n\n“And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hands of Israel” (Joshua 10:32).\n\n“Do not be afraid…I will deliver all of them” (Joshua 11:6).\n\n“And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel” (Joshua 11:8).\n\nSimilarly, repetitive language is used to describe Joshua’s devotion to God’s command:\n\n“So Joshua conquered all the land… as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him” (Joshua 10:40).\n\n“So Joshua did to them as the Lord had told him” (Joshua 11:9).\n\n“He utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded” (Joshua 11:12).\n\n“As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that the Lord had commanded Moses” (Joshua 11:15).\n\nAs the dust settles on the battlefield, look for it: the making and fulfillment of a promise. Devotion, obedience, and a commitment to one another, at all costs. In the midst of the struggle and the fear is this command: “Do not be afraid” (Joshua 10:25).\n\nIt sounds like a love story, doesn’t it? The love of God for His people—a love that spans much further than the physical territory Joshua conquered. It’s a love that would eventually come down in human form to save not only Israel from their enemies, but also you and me from a fate we surely deserved: “We have redemption in Him through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding” (Ephesians 1:7-8).\n\nI no longer want to turn my head from the battle scenes of Joshua. I see my own redemptive story in there now, woven in and out with the assurance of deliverance and of promises fulfilled. Victory is found in Christ alone. This is the greatest love story we will ever know.\n\n",

Her husband, a pastor, had been kidnapped and killed just eighteen months earlier. Dabbing her eyes with a tissue, she quietly described to me the sorrow her family had endured.\n\nMy mind struggled to comprehend her pain.

The woman’s response?\n\n“Every single one of them.” \n\nThis sweet stranger had come face to face with darkness and found that Jesus truly is the Light of the World (John 8:12). \n\nShe had walked through the Valley of the Shadow of Death and discovered Jesus is the resurrection and the life (Psalm 23:4; John 11:25). \n\nShe had buried her treasure but found that the treasure of God’s presence had remained (Matthew 13:44). \n\nGod’s faithfulness in her life helped me remember His faithfulness in my own. When circumstances cause my anxious heart to question if God’s promises are really true, I need look no further than my own life to remind myself of His faithfulness. \n\nThis is what we find God’s people doing in Joshua 12. They had seen the walls of Jericho come a-tumbling down (Joshua 6), then watched as the Lord stopped the sun in its track for an entire day and rained hailstones down on their enemies (Joshua 10). God had kept His promises to defeat Israel’s enemies and clear the path for them to enter into the promised land. But there were still many battles left to fight, “still very large areas of land to be taken over” (Joshua 13:1). \n\nI so often see myself in the stories of God’s people as they wandered. Like me, they were a wimpy-hearted bunch, prone to discouragement, defeat, and despair. Despite God’s unbroken track record, their confidence was easily shaken. \n\nSo here, in Joshua 12, we find a roll call of the kept promises of God: a list of the kings God’s people had conquered, the lands they’d captured. Each one is proof of God’s love and provision:\n\nThe king of Jericho, one.\n\nThe king of Ai, one.\n\nThe king of Jerusalem, one.\n\nThe king of Hebron, one…\n\nFor 31 kings, the list goes on. Over and over, God came through. There’s not a single example of Him dropping the ball. It was God’s track record, not their own, that emboldened God’s people to keep fighting, to keep walking toward the land they’d been promised. \n\nIt’s hard for fickle folks like us to fully grasp, but God is the promise keeper. Failing to come through is not in His nature. His faithfulness gives us the courage to keep moving forward, pressing on toward the prize (Philippians 3:13-14). And as we march toward the promised land, we can rest assured that He will keep His promises still. \n\nEvery. Single. One. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Joshua 13:1-33, Joshua 14:1-15, 2 Peter 3:13, Romans 4:13-17\n\nI grew up on old church hymns. I have vivid memories of me as a child and then a teenager, turning a purple hardcover hymnal to the page number specified in the bulletin. Sunday mornings and Sunday nights, donning a dress or jeans, I’d stand up straight in the pew and sing loud the songs that would become the sounds of my faith—my confession in a melody of sharps and flats (sung mostly on key).\n\nWhen I read the conquest and land allotment passages in Joshua, I find myself humming “Victory in Jesus” and remembering the pages of that hymnal. It’s a boisterous hymn—at least, our rendition was. The combination of the pounding piano chords and reverberating notes from the pipe organ made me lift my head a little higher and belt out Eugene Bartlett’s chorus a little louder. \n\nO victory in Jesus,\nMy Savior, forever.\nHe sought me and bought me\nWith His redeeming blood;\nHe loved me ere I knew Him\nAnd all my love is due Him,\nHe plunged me to victory,\nBeneath the cleansing flood.\n\nIt felt, well, victorious. The irony is that the actions expressed in these lyrics sound less like conquest and more like surrender. Being “sought” and “bought” and “plunged” into a flood is not congruent with my idea of winning. But in the gospel of Jesus, that’s exactly what it is. To be conquered by the grace of God is to be victorious.\n\nThe list of land divisions in Joshua 13 is more than just a test of our Old Testament pronunciation skills (a test I would fail with flying colors); it is a testimony to the precise, complete, and gracious fulfillment of God’s promise to Israel. Like every other promise God makes to His children, the boundaries described for each tribe were both fixed and fulfilled by God.  \n\nBut there’s even more to see here than the staggering detail with which the book describes the physical, promised land God gave Israel. Notice the phrasing used throughout chapters 13 and 14 for each portion of land. This land is their inheritance. It is a gift from the Lord, not based on merit but on identity. \n\nThe Israelites gained the land through conquest, but only with the one true God at the helm. Joshua’s people took the land, but only with the Lord of lords supplying the strength. This promised land was fulfilled because God secured it long ago as an inheritance for His children. The same is true of our eternal inheritance—our salvation.\n\nClifford in Shakespeare’s Henry VI declares, “God on our side, doubt not of victory!” And he was right. But this victory does not always look like we think it should. To be victorious in the Lord is to surrender what little might we have to the almighty One. To “win for Jesus” means losing ourselves in the flood of His forgiveness and grace.  \n\nWe are His children, His people, and He has granted us His very identity, sealed for us in Christ (Galatians 3:29). The new heavens and new earth are not yet ours to inhabit, but according to 2 Peter 3:13, the promise is ours now. The victory has been secured and the allotment has been assigned. \n\nYou and I don’t yet dwell in the new heavens with Christ. This fallen world we’re living in will never have the permanent “rest from war” we’ll enjoy in the new earth (Joshua 14:15). But Jesus dwells here with us—through the already-fulfilled promise of His Holy Spirit (John 14:26). “He is the down payment of our inheritance, for the redemption of the possession, to the praise of His glory” (Ephesians 1:14).\n\nThanks be to the Almighty God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Carolyn Denny\n\nText: Joshua 15:1-63, Joshua 16:1-10, 1 Peter 1:3-5, John 10:7-18\n\nGrowing up, Judah’s prospects looked pretty dim. Dysfunction? His family had it in spades. With all that family drama, it’s no wonder Judah ran away. Nor is it surprising that his problems continued to follow him. \n\nAfter marrying and having three sons of his own, the generational sin and chaos just perpetuated. Scripture tells us the first two were wicked and died young. The remaining son refused to care for his brother’s widow, Tamar; and while Judah was also responsible for her welfare, he refused to act on her behalf (Genesis 38:6-11). Eventually, Tamar used deceit to force his hand. Would Judah honor his responsibilities or run from them once again?\n\nWhen we look at Judah’s background, the answer seems obvious: Judah is not one of the “good guys.” He comes from one sinful mess and jumps right into another. Isn’t his course already set?\n\nThank God, the answer to that question is a resounding NO. Redemption is a constant refrain in the Bible: Your past does not define you (see Rahab). Your sin does not define you (see King David). Your family does not define you (see Ruth). Because of God’s love and mercy, Jesus Christ defines you. He calls you by name, and you are His (Isaiah 43:1). He alone created us, loves us perfectly, and saves us from our sin.\n\nJudah was not doomed by his past any more than you or me. God had great plans for him—plans to open his eyes to his own sinfulness (Genesis 38:26), plans to give him a new heart that could love well (Ezekiel 36:26), and even plans to reconcile his family and turn it into a great nation (Genesis 12:2). \n\nTamar’s trap became the turning point in Judah’s life. After he chose to take care of her, Judah returned to his father’s household, but this time as a sacrificial leader. By the time Judah received a final word from his father, it was a prophetic blessing: the future for his descendants would be long and bright (Genesis 49:10). This is the blessing we see unfolding in Joshua 15. Judah had become a tribe numbering in the thousands, and that tribe had arrived at the promised land to receive its inheritance.\n\nIn Ephesians, Paul wrote that God “is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us” (Ephesians 3:20). Do we really believe that? Or do we think it’s too late for us? Deep down, have we believed the lie that there are places God’s redemptive grasp can’t reach? \n\nWhen you feel stuck in dysfunction, or hounded by your past, remember Who defined Judah and his future. The tribe of Judah brought forth Jesus Christ, the “Lion of Judah” and the anchor of our true identity (John 1:12-13). He has an eternal inheritance for us beyond what we can imagine.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Joshua 17:1-18, Joshua 18:1-28, Hebrews 9:1-14\n\nAs much as I love traveling, there is nothing like coming home. Sleeping in my own bed, waking up to my own coffeemaker, hearing the familiar hum of traffic outside my window—home is truly a restful reprieve.\n\nIn Joshua chapter 18, we see a new home established for the nation of Israel at Shiloh: “Now the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of meeting there. And the land was subdued before them” (Joshua 18:1).\n\nThe tabernacle was the physical manifestation of God’s presence among His people. He dwelled in the innermost part of it, the holy of holies. In the midst of dividing territory and separating themselves physically from one another, it’s significant that the Israelites—all of the Israelites—now gathered in this one place to be in the presence of the Lord. God was the center, the core, of this people. And Shiloh would be His resting place for the next 300 years, until the Israelites were defeated by the Philistines.\n\nWhen I looked up “Shiloh” in Hebrew, I came across a couple of definitions. One was “a place of rest” and the other, “peace.”\n\nI don’t know that we can fully understand how the Israelites must have felt to finally settle and put down roots after years and years of traveling as nomads. An entire generation had been born and raised on foot, a generation that didn’t know what it meant to have a home—to have something to return to, a place to rest.\n\nThis is something we all understand: to have wandered far and long, to be weary and tired and thirsty, to desire peace—real peace. We all desire a place to call home.\n\nWhat this scene at Shiloh points us to is the place we, as Christians, now find our rest. “But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands. Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption” (Hebrews 9:11-12).\n\nThe atonement for our sin that was once achieved through sacrifice and ritual in the tabernacle, is now complete through Christ’s blood. He entered the Most Holy Place once, and for all. For me and for you. \n\nJesus is our Shiloh.\n\nAre you weary? “Come to Me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28).\n\nAre you thirsty? “Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty again” (John 4:14).\n\nAre you hungry? “I am the bread of life… No one who comes to Me will ever be hungry” (John 6:35).\n\nAre you restless? “Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7).\n\nIn Christ, we have rest and reprieve. In Christ, we have a home. \n\nLet us gather at Shiloh today and rest in that truth.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Joshua’s Inheritance",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nText: Joshua 19:1-51, Genesis 49:1-28, Acts 13:16-25\n\nI was 10 or 11 years old when I first read Little Women. In the years before I opened that book, I thought reading and writing were “school” activities. I wrote stories because my teacher required it, not because I actually liked it. But Louisa May Alcott changed all that. She awakened something inside me, and I wanted in. So I pulled a blank notebook out of my desk, and I scribbled a story inside it.\n\nSince then, my heart has drawn ever deeper into writing. Writing about God’s Word, and teaching it to others, makes my soul sing. I’m certain it’s the thing I was created to do.\n\nHowever, it hasn’t always come easily. Around the time I dove headfirst into writing, God called me back to school. It felt like an obstacle to my dream, but not an insurmountable one, so I pressed on. Then, I got pregnant and had a baby. Then I got pregnant again and had another baby. All while I was still in school.\n\nBetween school and marriage and parenting, my attention was pulled in a lot of directions, and it wasn’t long before writing got put on the backburner. All the while, I watched as my writing friends achieved their own goals. One by one, they grew their ministries and published books, while I was lucky to steal an hour to write. My friends had reached the promised land, while I remained just outside it.\n\nWaiting is always hard, but it is made especially difficult by comparison. When your friends or colleagues attain the thing you want, it’s tough to hold on to contentment. The ache is somehow heightened by the sight of another’s success.\n\nWhen I read the story of Joshua, I wonder if he knew this ache. A skilled, lifelong warrior, Joshua wasn’t appointed to lead Israel until he was 90 years old. Then, he spent another decade guiding the Israelites into the promised land. After he accomplished all that, he dispensed the land to the twelve tribes of Israel. Only at the very end of the journey, and the very end of his life, after everyone else had received their inheritance, did Joshua receive his (Joshua 19:49-50). \n\nJoshua waited a lot, and I wonder how the story might have been different had he been guided by impatience. I wonder how his leadership might have been compromised had his spirit been discontent. Thankfully, Joshua succumbed to neither. He was a man who waited well. Rather than pine for the life he wanted, Joshua made himself available to the will of God. His waiting was both active and fruitful. \n\nI suspect Joshua did all this because he trusted God’s promises. He knew God would make good on His Word because He always does. From the start, God told Joshua what would be required to endure this particular journey: “Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them” (Joshua 1:6).\n\nGod always comes through. This was a truth that guarded the integrity of Joshua’s leadership. God promised to be with Joshua, to bring him success wherever he went (Joshua 1:7,9), and that’s just what He did. By trusting in God’s perfect timing, Joshua accomplished a lot through his waiting.\n\nThe story of Joshua reminds us that we don’t have to despair in the waiting. God’s promises are trustworthy, His plans are precise, and His timing is perfect—which means waiting isn’t a setback. It’s an opportunity. \n\nDon’t waste your waiting. Your story is much bigger than the ending.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nText: Joshua 20:1-9, Joshua 21:1-45, Exodus 21:12-14, Hebrews 2:14-15\n\nThe nation of Israel had been through a lot. \n\nThey conquered the land of Canaan, driving out existing nations and taking over the land. They crossed the raging Jordan River. Before that, they wandered in the desert for 40 years, waiting for God to signal when it was time to move. And before that, they were a nation of slaves, living in Egypt under hardship and oppression.\n\nYet God had His hand in all of it, like He does in our lives. In Genesis 15, God made a covenant promise to Abraham, spelling out exactly what would happen to his descendants.\n\nGod promised that Abraham would have numerous offspring. He kept that promise. The Israelites multiplied more and more the longer the Egyptians oppressed them (Exodus 1:12). \n\nGod promised Abraham that his descendants would be enslaved for 400 years. And they were. The Egyptians worked the Israelites ruthlessly and made their lives bitter (Exodus 1:13-14). \n\nGod also promised to judge the nation the Israelites served. Indeed, the Angel of the Lord killed all the firstborn of Egypt and passed judgment against the gods of Egypt (Exodus 12:12).\n\nGod promised that His people would leave the nation they served with overwhelming possessions. And they did. The Egyptians gave the Israelites silver, gold jewelry, and clothing as they left Egypt (Exodus 12:35-36).\n\nFinally, God promised to bring Abraham’s descendants back to the promised land. In Joshua, we see God drive out the inhabitants of Canaan and give the land to Israel (Joshua 21:43-44).\n\nWe serve the same God today. He makes promises to us as His children, just as He made promises to the house of Israel.\n\nHe will meet all our needs (Philippians 4:19).\n\nHe will provide for us (Matthew 6:33).\n\nHe will never leave us or forsake us (Deuteronomy 31:8).\n\nHe has a purpose for us (Romans 8:28).\n\nRemembering God’s faithfulness in our past helps us cling to His promises in our present. When I struggle to believe that He will provide for my needs, I remember how He provided that check in the mail at exactly the right moment. When I’m overwhelmed with loneliness, I think of the friendships He’s given me and how He Himself walked through dark moments with me. When I fear condemnation for my sin and mistakes, I recall the ways He’s already redeemed my past.\n\nGod’s promises are our foundation. He fulfills His every word. We can cling to His promises as we wander in the desert and fight the enemy. We can count on Him to be fully faithful (Joshua 21:45).\n\n“None of the good promises the Lᴏʀᴅ had made to the house of Israel failed. Everything was fulfilled.”\n– Joshua 21:45\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Joshua 22:1-34, 2 Corinthians 1:21-22, Psalm 7:8-11\n\n“I’ve never been asked to play Dixie® Cups before!” said my grandmother… and, well, most people. \n\nIt was my favorite childhood game: stealing the box of mouthwash cups from the bathroom, then dumping its contents onto the table and standing the paper cups to attention. \n\nIt was like playing a game of “Memory”—the object was to find the cup that matched the one in my hand. Except my game was better, because instead of only one possible match, there were probably twenty. Once a match was made, I’d add the pair to my prized, yet toppling, tower of cups. \n\nClearly my game did not require superior memory skills, but that little tower was a comforting sight nonetheless. I loved to remember that the odds were stacked in my favor. I needed to remember that. \n\nThe eastern tribes of Israel needed to remember, too. They’d wandered in the wilderness—twice!—but their journey was also bookended with two miraculous water crossings. As they crossed the Jordan River, they came across giant stones—ones they never would have seen without God making a way for them in the river. Marking each as a promise kept from the Lord, they began to stack them, creating an altar of remembrance. Each river stone said, God brought you out of the wilderness and carried you through this river. Remember this. \n\nThey were just rocks, and yet, they were so much more. Unlike an altar built for idol-worshipping, this was a token shouting out the one true God’s faithfulness, created in His presence and stacked high for all to see. \n\n“It is to be a witness between us and you, and between the generations after us, so that we may carry out the worship of the Lord in His presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fellowship offerings.”\n- Joshua 22:27\n\nA witness. The rocks their feet had walked across in obedience also bore witness to the grace of the Father, who makes small things significant and significant things small. \n\nMy Dixie cup towers were small yet significant, too—filled with joy, yet paper and disposable. It would’ve been easy for anyone to assume that my toppling tower was begging to be thrown away, when that wasn’t part of the game at all. Small and significant things are also easily misunderstood. \n\nWhen the western tribes of Israel encountered the eastern tribes’ altars of remembrance, they mistook them for a sign of aggression. They even began preparing for civil war! Oops. They couldn’t have known what the rocks meant. They couldn’t have seen their mistake. The Israelites, like you and I, were trying the best they could! But they were confused. \n\nDon’t worry—the tribes came together to discuss the matter, and fears fizzled as they recalled the Truth they held in common. “Yahweh is the God of gods! Yahweh is the God of gods!” (Joshua 22:22). They remembered what we are learning: The humans in the story may be confused, but the God of the story is sovereign and good. \n\nWhere there is human confusion, Christ is our resolve. Where we build towers, He seals hearts. While we build temporary remembrances of God, He has already created a permanent remembrance within us. “He has also sealed us and given us the Spirit as a down payment in our hearts” (2 Corinthians 1:21-22).\n\nWhether we walk in wilderness, or find a miraculous crossing, or build towers in His name, may we continue to put our trust and hope in God alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Joshua 23:1-16, Joshua 24:1-33, Matthew 11:28-30, Hebrews 4:1-13\n\nEven the greatest leaders die. As Joshua prepared for the end of his life, he addressed Israel—those people of God who had followed him through impossible circumstances to an improbable reward.\n\n“I am now going the way of all the earth, and you know with all your heart and all your soul that none of the good promises the Lord your God made to you has failed. Everything was fulfilled for you; not one promise has failed.”\n– Joshua 23:14\n\nIt was time for Joshua to go. In keeping with his steady voice as their leader, Joshua’s farewell address was a plea for Israel to do three things: Remember what God has done. Obey Him courageously and completely. Worship Him alone.\n\nI like to picture the scene as Joshua stood there in front of the tribes, relaying one last message from the Lord. I like to imagine the passion in his voice as he recounted their treacherous journey—how God rescued His people from generations of idol worship and multiplied their descendants, how He rescued them from slavery in Egypt and sustained them in the wilderness, and how He ushered them into the promised land, handing them every victory along the way. This line is my favorite:\n\n“I gave you a land you did not labor for, and cities you did not build, though you live in them; you are eating from vineyards and olive groves you did not plant.”\n– Joshua 24:13\n\nThe Lord did it all. And Joshua, with all the earnestness his 110 years could muster, was asking Israel to remember, to obey, and to worship the God of the Rescue.\n\nThis was not a call for arbitrary emotion or passive intention. This request was active and specific. Joshua gave the people instructions specific to their time and circumstance, but his admonition echoes even to us: “You are witnesses against yourselves that you yourselves have chosen to worship Yahweh” (Joshua 24:22). In other words, Don’t just say this. Mean it. Do it.\n\n“We are witnesses,” they said back to him.\n\n“Then get rid of the foreign gods that are among you and offer your hearts to the Lord, the God of Israel” (v. 23).\n\nI like Joshua’s style: “Okay then. Get on with it.”\n\nJoshua was a good leader. But even he did not perfectly fulfill the promises he solicited from the people. Even Joshua was a sinner in need of a savior. He was used by the Lord to secure a tangible inheritance for his people. But, like Joshua himself, that inheritance was only temporary. The rest from war would not last. \n\nNot even Joshua could bring God’s people salvation.\n\nJoshua couldn’t, but Jesus did.\n\nJesus obeyed perfectly and followed the Father faithfully. And when we did not and could not? Jesus satisfied God’s wrath for our sin and granted us the eternal benefit of His perfect obedience (Romans 3:25-26). Jesus has gone ahead of us into the very death that was ours and conquered it on our behalf (2 Timothy 1:10). Christ secured for us an inheritance that is eternal, a rest that will last (Hebrews 4:9).\n\nHere in the last chapters of Joshua, as we look back over the epic story of what God did for His people, we lean in and listen to the wise old man’s words: Remember what God has done. Obey Him courageously and completely. Worship Him alone.\n\nBe faithful to the God of the Rescue. And when your faithfulness fails, lean wholly on the grace of Christ. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 21:1-25, Deuteronomy 12:8-14, 2 Samuel 24:18-25\n\n“The Hollow Men” is a haunting, exquisite poem by T.S. Eliot. You may have heard the closing lines referenced in pop culture: “This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper.” \n\nI reread the poem after walking backward and forward through today’s passage in Judges, the final chapter of a brutal journey. We are trained, when reading stories, to settle into a conclusion not long after the climax. We long to be satisfied. The book of Judges doesn’t do that. \n\nEarlier in the poem, Eliot writes:\nThe eyes are not here\nThere are no eyes here\nIn this valley of dying stars\nIn this hollow valley\nThis broken jaw of our lost kingdoms\n… death’s twilight kingdom,\nThe hope only\nOf empty men.\n\nEliot’s “empty men” are a helpful comparison as we end our study of Judges. The weight and power of Eliot’s words capture, in ways I never could, the heart-wailing of the tribes of Israel. When death is the only hope, we are left in total darkness. \n\nWe know that Jesus is our conquering King, the life and light of men. But Judges doesn’t end with Jesus. Judges ends with a “valley of dying stars,” empty men grasping together at nothing. “In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes” (v. 25). As modern readers, we can read this last verse in Judges and know it’ll all be okay because Jesus is coming. Even though that is true, would you be willing to resist that temptation for closure with me today? \n\nLet us whimper. Let us feel the ache of the ages, the desperation for something we cannot name. The longing for a king that led the Israelites in caustic circles, is the same longing that leads us to fill our lives with stuff that distracts and tries to counteract that epic ache. \n\nThe inclination to grasp at goodness is the right response to reading the book of Judges. Our hearts are magnetized to light, not darkness. Judges provokes that tension in us, leaving us with an unsettled feeling. It is a historical book, a true tragedy tucked in the middle of the greatest book ever written. And yet, its darkness is unparalleled. Its darkness makes us crave light. \n\nChiaroscuro is an art technique that utilizes sharp contrasts—light and dark—for dramatic impact. Judges is a book of chiaroscuro. The whole picture of the Bible is made more vibrant, more impactful, more necessary because of these dark corners. We can thank God for the book of Judges, and we can thank Him for wiring our hearts to long for the goodness and light that only He provides.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "War Against Benjamin",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 20:1-48, Deuteronomy 18:1-5, Proverbs 16:33\n\nIt all started with a little boy and itchy skin, which is honestly the worst way for anything to begin. He was my little brother, two years old at the time, and as the scratching continued, it became clear the cause was more than an irritation from running around in the grass or an aggravated mosquito bite. Still, my parents applied Cortisone cream and hoped for the best, leaving a message for the pediatrician to call in the morning.\n\nBut overnight, I, too, began to scratch my skin, and red bumps proved the cause to be more than an allergy to something we’d eaten for dinner the night before. By morning, my mom was also itchy, the final straw to explain our fate: chicken pox.\n\nSo there we were, all three of us, left to schedule back-to-back oatmeal baths, share anti-itch cream, take turns complaining, and inconvenience our one remaining caretaker, my father. To think this all started with a little boy and itchy skin.\n\nIsrael was quick to assume sin was a “someone else” problem, and if I’m being honest, I’m often guilty of doing the same. The crime at Gibeah? Certainly it was someone else’s fault. Surely, the people of Benjamin were the only ones who didn’t have it all together, and war needed to be waged against them to make everything right.\n\nBut first, God used the war against Benjamin to point out the ways Israel, too, was infected with sin. While these accounts are difficult to take in and unfold like a horror story, they all play a part in God reminding His children what happens when they forget Him and rely only on what they can see. Everyone was doing what appeared to be right in their own eyes, and that lead to death and destruction. \n\nThe Israelites first defeat at the hands of the badly outnumbered Benjaminites caused them to weep before the Lord and inquire of Him if they should attack again the next day. It wasn’t until their second failure that they turned to fasting and making sacrifices for their sins. It’s dangerous to keep on living in sickness, but unfortunately, many times it takes something truly terrible to recognize the destructiveness of sin.\n\nChapter 20 of Judges isn’t necessarily something you’d want to write on your dry erase board or commit to needlepoint, but it’s significant to the heartbeat of humanity. It’s been said that sometimes, to receive the depth of the good news, we must first be able to swallow the bad. And yet, here is my favorite part of this passage: God answered the Israelites, despite their sin. When they asked questions, no matter how infected their souls were, He answered. And that is the God we serve. \n\nWe may waver from Him and, for a time, commit to our own selfish ways, but by the grace of God, His commitment is to the changing of hearts. Our stories will all end with our sinful selves redeemed by the faithful Father. Thanks be to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Outrage in Benjamin",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nEditor’s Note: Some passages in Judges deal in subject matter that might be especially painful for some readers. Though many of the wounds we receive in this life are deeply personal and unimaginably painful, when they appear in God’s Word, we are reminded that He sees them. Whenever sin is addressed in Scripture—whether through teaching or story—it comes to us in the context of God’s unwavering commitment to bring an end to all evil in this world through the finished work of Christ (Revelation 21:3-4). We are praying for and with you as you read.\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 19:1-30, Jeremiah 8:18-9:3, 2 Corinthians 6:14-18\n\nThis is dark. I don’t like to think about horrible things. And I would like to think this story has nothing to do with me. Because I am A) not a terrorizer of women, B) not a concubine, and C) not a murderer. So I would like to be excused from this exercise and come back when we are talking about the wonderful grace of Jesus instead. Or maybe we could (please!) gloss over this and talk about how heaven will be paved with streets of gold. I’m here for all of that. \n\nBut perhaps we could be brave and try to look at this Judges 19 passage together.\n\nFirst, before we get too angry with the Levite for having a concubine in the first place, let’s consider what some scholars have to say about her: the concubine was probably the Levite’s wife, but was called a “concubine” because she was not endowed with a dowry. Either way, it looks like she was unfaithful to him and left him. \n\nThe delay caused by all the over-politeness in the house of her father meant that they stayed longer and later than intended. When they finally arrive in an Israelite city, there is only one man willing to take them in. Just as Lot was the only hospitable man in Sodom (Genesis 19:1–29), this old Ephraimite is the only refuge in Gibeah.\n\nThe men of Gibeah, like the men of Sodom, surrounded the house and sought to do great wickedness to the guests. The old Ephraimite, like Lot, offered a wicked substitution to preserve the Levite: he offered up his own daughter and the Levite’s concubine. The men of Gibeah took only the concubine, but abused her to death that night.\n\nThe Levite’s role that night seems to be one of passivity and cowardice. It is unclear how his action or inaction enter into the matter, although it seems his “eating and drinking” in this story are twice his undoing: first in delaying his departure from the house of her father, and second, in occupying him on this night of the wickedness of Gibeah.\n\nIn the morning, when he exited the house, he found his concubine on the steps, seemingly asleep. But when he found her to be dead, he took her up, returned home, and then sent out his bloody message to the chiefs of Israel, a testimony of the wickedness of Gibeah.\n\nThe Bible is brief and thrifty in its narratives. As with so much of Scripture, it comes to us in parables, in examples, often without explicit explanation of what we are to take away from it all. This passage, however, seems to give us direct instruction: “Think it over, discuss it, and speak up!” (Judges 19:30).\n\nWe are to be broken by the brokenness of this world, but not only of the world. We are to be broken by the brokenness of the Church, of God’s own people, of ourselves, and our own hearts (Jeremiah 8:21). Consider how profound a warning this story is against our passivity toward sin. Any sin, left to itself, can end in horrors unthinkable. \n\nMay we be broken over our own sin, over the sins of our people, and in the world! May Christ have mercy on us. May He deal kindly and gently with us, and give not to us as our sins deserve, but preserve us by His good will.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 18:1-31, Deuteronomy 17:18-20, Psalm 78:56-66\n\n“Just look away, look away. There’s nothing but horror and inconvenience on the way.” \n\nThis theme song plays grimly at the start of each episode of the television show, A Series of Unfortunate Events. Despite the warning, I kept watching and hoping the show’s main characters, three orphans, would eventually find relief. Each episode ended in dismay as the orphans’ lives spiraled further out of control. The story became more tragic at every turn. As I read Judges 18, the same theme song crept into the back of my mind: “Just look away, look away… ”\n\nIsrael’s story took dark turn after dark turn, as the people made bad choice after bad choice. Redeemed out of slavery, all their needs were taken care of by the Lord, yet they forgot their God and lost their way. Quickly they fell into sin and idolatry. We’re talking idol worship, murder, absolute lawlessness. How could God’s chosen people fall so far so fast?\n\nFrom the outside looking in, the Israelites’ missteps are plain to see. But in our own lives, it’s much easier to lose perspective. The Israelites thought they could run their lives better than God could. For example, we saw in today’s reading that God provided land for the tribe of the Danites, but they found a quiet town to conquer instead. Veering from God’s provision, they left behind a wake of physical and spiritual destruction. The Lord also asked the Israelites for their sole devotion, but the Danites opted for idol worship in instead (Judges 18:27–31).  \n\nThe Danites, a tribe of Israel, thought they could make a better, happier, more abundant future for themselves than the one the Lord had laid out for them. Sometimes I wonder, Am I guilty of this sort of arrogance too? Do I ever believe my plan is superior to the Lord’s? When I forget the goodness and wisdom of God, I’m likely to fall into the same trap of disobedience, foolishly thinking I can create a brighter future for myself than the one God has planned.\n\nWe choose our own plans because we don’t trust God’s plan is actually good for us. Or maybe, like the Danites, we forget that our God has the power to move mountains. Perhaps God calls us to give our money or time or energy, but we hold back. Or maybe He lays it on our hearts to repair a relationship, but we decide it’s better to sweep the issue under the rug. In the short term, we think our plan is less painful, more effective. But if we look at what happened with Israel when they forgot God’s instruction, it’s clear that a life of disobedience only brings pain and suffering.\n\nMay the Danites’ story remind us that we are all utterly lost without God’s guidance. We have access to God’s wisdom in Word and Spirit. Our Father in heaven knows what is best for us and works for our good. Placing our trust in the Lord and obeying Him will not always be easy, but we have a powerful promise of true life, flourishing, and full of purpose when we look to Jesus and walk in His ways.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 17:1-13, Leviticus 26:1, Hosea 11:1-12, James 3:9-12\n\nSometimes idolatry is easy to identify. For instance, when I find myself wanting to be more like my favorite Instagram celebrity than Jesus, I know I am idolizing the Instagram celebrity. Or, when I start prioritizing my body image over my spiritual health and well-being, I know I am idolizing how I look. But idolatry can also be stealthy, especially when it is disguised as piety. This is certainly the case for Micah, his shrines, and his priests.\n\nMicah’s story is a slow progression down a dangerous path. It begins with an offering to the Lord—the silver he had stolen from his mother. However, part of the offering is melted down and formed into an idol, something strictly forbidden by Hebrew law (Leviticus 26:1). This idol is then joined by other idols and set up as a shrine in Micah’s household. Micah even makes an ephod, which was a garment worn only by priests, and installs one of his sons as a priest to oversee the shrine.\n\nSlowly but surely, we see what Micah is doing: he is turning his home into a tabernacle. The transformation is complete when a young Levite shows up at his door. “Stay with me,” invites Micah, “and be my father and priest” (Judges 17:10). And the Levite stays, legitimizing Micah’s efforts. Then Micah says, “Now I know that the Lord will be good to me, because a Levite has become my priest” (v.13).\n\nThe elements are there—a priest from the appropriate tribe, the priestly garments, an offering of silver to the Lord—but Micah’s heart exposes his transactional relationship with God, and these motives reveal his idolatry: Now I know the Lord will be good to me.\n\nIdolatry in the name of the Lord is often the hardest to spot and the most destructive. I can easily idolize my religion over my Savior. I can lose trust in the promise of Christ and begin trusting in my church attendance or how often I volunteer or read Scripture. These rituals in and of themselves are good, but they are meant as an avenue to commune with God, not to be my own god. What often begins as an attempt to be near God can put distance between my heart and His.  \n\nMicah did not need to turn his home into a tabernacle and his family into priests, because God was already dwelling among the Israelites. In the same way, I don’t have to idolize my religion in an attempt to be nearer to God because He has already come near to me through the person of Jesus Christ, and He remains with me by the Holy Spirit.  \n\nMicah’s story proves that the line is fine between being active participants in our religion and idolizing it. What starts as piety can quickly slip into idolatry if we’re not careful. And in our attempt to be closer to God, we actually end up turning away from true and intimate relationship with Him.\n\nMay I heed the warning in Micah’s story and honestly examine my heart: Do I worship my religion, or do I worship the Lord, my God? \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Samson’s Defeat and Death",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 16:1-31, Jeremiah 15:15–16, Hebrews 11:32–38\n\nIt’s hard to know how to feel about Samson. Sure, he’s listed among the judges of Israel and later manages a nod in the Hebrews “Hall of Faith” (chapter 11). But every time I read his story, I scratch my head and wonder, Why?\n\nAfter all, he did sleep with prostitutes (Judges 16:1). His affair with Delilah was so toxic it reads like an episode of a certain popular dating reality TV series (vv. 4–20). He seems both arrogant and unwise, not exactly typical “man of God” material—not to mention all the killing. Isolated as a stand-alone narrative, this one feels like an outlier. But the flawed character of Samson (and the rest of the judges) is merely a lower layer of a greater story.\n\nThe heroes of our faith didn’t secure their status through flawless holiness. Every judge, every prophet, every disciple, and every deliverer had the same broken nature we do. From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible is the story of the most ragtag, rebellious, disappointing disciples imaginable—unless the story is not about them at all.\n\nThe stories of the judges of Israel, including Samson, and the stories of our own broken lives are merely footnotes in the bigger story—the story of a God who redeems, restores, and uses everything for our good and His glory.\n\nInstead of trying to convince ourselves that Samson is a worthy hero, we ought to let his flaws and failures remind us of the true Judge (Matthew 25:31–46), who rescues God’s people perfectly. Like a prism, let us hold Samson’s story up to the light, looking for the truth of who God is.\n\nSamson loved an undeserving woman who eventually betrayed him.\n\nJesus loves the bride of Christ, the Church, despite our long history of running from Him into the arms of other lovers.\n\nSamson was betrayed for a few pieces of silver.\n\nJesus was betrayed for an even lower price, His monetary value even less than a lustful, violent Nazarite.\n\nSamson was bound, humiliated, and tormented by the Philistines (Judges 16:19-21).\n\nJesus endured even worse for our sake (Isaiah 53).\n\nSamson’s enemies rejoiced too soon. The battle was not yet over. So must it have been with the powers of darkness, as Jesus lay dead and lifeless in a borrowed tomb. But just as Samson would rise again to bring down the house of his enemies, Jesus would rise from the grave on the third day to bring down the house on sin and death. Samson secured a limited and scandalous legacy (Judges 16:31). Not Jesus! He ripped history in two. Samson died among his enemies in a heap of rubble, while Jesus kept His promise that when His enemies tore down the temple, He would rebuild it in three days (John 2:19).\n\nSamson is a flawed frontrunner to our true Savior; therefore, Samson’s story is worth reading because it points to Someone so much better. God has provided something infinitely better for us in Jesus Christ (Hebrews 11:39–40), and because of Him, sin and death have been defeated once and for all (Romans 6:10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 15:1-20, Psalm 106:40-48, Isaiah 40:27-31\n\nGoodness, things just keep getting worse. \n\nReading Samson’s life story feels like watching a particularly dark television series. Death and destruction follow him everywhere he goes. In Judges 15, Samson sets fire to the tails of 300 foxes and sets the Philistines’ farmland and vineyards ablaze. His wife and father-in-law are burned to death in a gruesome retaliation. Men are ripped limb from limb. And when it’s all said and done, Samson, infused with the Spirit of the Lord, single-handedly kills 1,000 men with the jawbone of a donkey (Judges 15:16).\n\nWhat in the world is going on here? \n\nIt’s important to remember that in the midst of this bloody, heartbreaking story, God is still present, and that He has endowed Samson with great strength and fervor in order to free the Israelites from the Philistines. It’s also important to remember that redemption is never clean and simple. It is a bloody business. Samson is caught in a web of back-and-forth retaliation, and he knows in his heart that in the end, it is his job to rid the Israelites of their oppressors. \n\nWhen the Israelites find Samson hiding out in a cave, they do not join him to fight the way the Israelites have done in the past. No, they bind him and hand him over to the enemy. They cower. They see his strength, but they do not see him as a savior. Instead of recognizing Samson as a deliverer, they hand him over to the Philistines, bound and ready for death. But Samson inflicts justice on the Philistines through this small, weak weapon: the jawbone of a donkey. It is an unexpected, bloody redemption.\n\nDoes this story sound familiar at all? \n\nMany years after the time of the judges, God sent the Israelites a Savior who is one with God and full of the Spirit (John 1:1–18; Luke 3:21–22). Rather than recognize His strength, the Israelites handed Jesus over to their oppressors and Pontius Pilate to be crucified.\n\nBut this time—this final time—the blood that was shed was not of the enemy. God turned the story on its head. Rather than kill off the Romans, Jesus went to the cross willingly to shed His own blood for us. It is an unexpected, bloody redemption. \n\nThanks be to God for saving us from ourselves, our sin, and the schemes of the enemy. May we give thanks to His holy name, and rejoice in praising Him (Psalm 106:47).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 14:1-20, Isaiah 11:1-5, Matthew 13:16\n\nA number of years ago, I met a famous person I had long respected from afar. This is always a tense experience, isn’t it? Most of us, I think, when we encounter famous people, get nervous to some degree. It happens to me less now than it did before because I have interacted with a number of “famous” Christians through my job. But still, especially when meeting some people, my palms get sweaty. Beyond that tension, I’m afraid that when I meet a famous person he or she is not going to be nice. Meeting someone we admire only to learn he or she is human is disorienting and disappointing.\n\nIn Judges 14, we continue to read about Samson, a judge appointed by God, a distinguished leader of God’s people, and a massive disappointment. We have already been exposed to Samson and his background, but it is here in chapter 14 that we see his disobedience. In verses 1–4, Samson disobeys the will of his parents and seeks a Philistine woman “because she seemed right to [him]”  (v. 7). This is a foreshadowing of his weakness. For all his physical strength, for all his natural gifting, he is proving to be weak in character. \n\nSamson shares a riddle with Philistine men at his marriage feast. He will pay them handsomely if they solve the riddle within a week, and they will pay him if they don’t. Because they have trouble solving the riddle, they threaten Samson’s wife, which leads her to squeeze the answer out of him, despite Samson not giving the answer to his mother or father. He loses the bet because his wife gives the Philistine men the answer. This leads Samson to kill thirty other Philistine men in order to pay up his end of the bet.\n\nFlashes of Samson’s strength, reliance on the Spirit of God, and anointing give glimpses of what the true Savior of God’s people, Jesus, would one day look like. Some may have thought Samson would be the deliverer of Israel, but unfortunately, he sought his own way and was undermined by his weakness. \n\nIn Isaiah 11 we read that the Savior of the world would shoot up from the stump of Jesse, in the line of David, and deliver the people of God from their disobedience and weakness. His justice would be righteous because His wisdom is from above. Jesus, our perfect Judge (Matthew 25:31-46), “will not judge by what he sees with his eyes, he will not execute justice by what he hears with his ears” (Isaiah 11:3).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 13:1-25, Numbers 6:1-12, Isaiah 9:6\n\nI have always wanted to need glasses. While my peers growing up feared being called “four eyes” as a result of their impaired vision, I teemed with jealousy over their newest accessory. While I’m, of course, very grateful for my 20/20 vision, I secretly fear reading glasses will no longer be in style when I actually (fingers crossed) need them one day. \n\nWhen it comes to this life, I think we all secretly hope that there’s more than meets the eye, that we aren’t quite seeing the full truth just yet. When we experience pain we don’t understand and our circumstances don’t turn out the way we’d hoped, we try to analyze things from all angles. How did this happen? Did I miss something? How could I have avoided all this suffering? Wouldn’t it be a huge relief to look through a viewfinder and have someone adjust things until they appear more clearly, until we’re able to make sense of what we see?\n\nThe gospel is the viewfinder through which all things make sense. Sin has damaged our vision for God’s goodness and plan, making it impossible for us to see with clarity until He removes the veils from our eyes in the heavenly realm. Then we will see the details that go into God’s promise to make all things new. Only then will we begin to fathom the lengths to which He’s gone to keep His promises. But until that time, life on earth is full of hoping and longing, and the occasional glimpse into God’s bigger story at play.\n\nAll throughout the book of Judges, it’s obvious that Israel is blinded by their own sin. In fact, this ominous phrase occurs for the seventh time in today’s reading: “The Israelites again did what was evil in the Lord’s sight” (Judges 13:1). Israel had come to trust only what their own eyes could see.\n\nImagine the surprise Manoah and his wife must have felt when, after years of barrenness, the angel of the Lord announced that they would have a son. It’s doubtful they saw this blessed, yet baffling, news coming. Many questions followed: How can this be? What will the boy’s responsibilities and work be? What is this angel’s name, who has brought us this great news? While they didn’t receive answers to those questions, the angel’s instruction made it clear that this son was to be set apart and “holy to the LORD during the time of consecration” (Numbers 6:8).\n\nClearly, there was more at work than what their human eyes could see. Samson’s impending birth was an introduction to the birth of new possibilities they never could have dreamt up for themselves, an unexpected form of redemption, bringing God’s heart a little more into focus. As God’s children, this is where we can settle our trust: Christ’s coming keeps us focused on hope. Even if all the other details of life seem blurry and unknown, we know we can put our trust in Him. May we view this story and our own as just a small piece of the grander reality of God’s great plan for His people. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 12:1-15, 1 Samuel 8:19-22, Ecclesiastes 5:4-7\n\nJephthah’s life is starting to unravel. Because of his rash vow, his daughter is dead and his family is broken. Jephthah was wrong to make that vow, and he was wrong to keep it. Because he was called into leadership by men instead of being raised up by God, he was man’s solution to a problem that can only be solved by God. And now, after a seemingly great victory over the Ammonites, the Ephraimites are pounding at his door and threatening to burn his house down over a ridiculous tiff.\n\nIronically, Jephthah’s house is really already on fire by the time the Ephraimites come for him, sharpening their flints. And the fire that burned was kindled by Jephthah’s very own hands and lips. It was the destructive fire of his sin. And he couldn’t keep the smoldering smoke a secret for long.\n\nThe Ephraimites have no good reason to pick a fight with Jephthah. They are angry because he didn’t summon them to help fight the Ammonites. Since he had been called to leadership by the Gileadites, Jephthah really had no authority to summon the tribe of Ephraim to war in the first place. But once they Jephthah is victorious over the Ammonites, they want a piece of that juicy victory and rise up against Jephthah.\n\nIn Shakespeare’s epic tragedy, Hamlet, Queen Gertrude groans, “When sorrows come, they come not as single spies, but in battalions.” In the same way, as Jephthah’s sins pile up, he continues to trudge forward in his own strength, his wrongs and sorrows compounding. Before he knows it, his own house is in shambles. A threat from foreigners to burn his house down is laughable because he has already burned what is valuable with his own actions. No amount of water could douse the flames ignited by the murder of his own daughter. This sin that was closest to his heart ended his career. His time as a judge was over. Jephthah was so burned by the evil that cauterized his family, he could not recover.\n\nOur darkest and most burning sins damage us in profound ways. But hope is never lost. Sometimes fire is the severe mercy we require. “This third I will put into the fire; I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will call on my name and I will answer them; I will say, ‘They are my people,’ and they will say, ‘The Lord is our God’” (Zechariah 13:9). Even if the house of your heart is on fire, call on His name and He will answer you.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 11:1-40, Leviticus 18:21, Leviticus 20:2-5, Matthew 5:34-37\n\nWhen God delivers His people, He “raises up” a deliverer to lead them. Take Moses and Gideon (Exodus 9:16; Judges 6:12), Othniel and Samuel (Judges 3:9; 1 Samuel 2:35), Jeroboam and Cyrus (1 Kings 14:7; Isaiah 45:13), and of course, Jesus (Jeremiah 23:5)—just to name a few.\n\nBut when we read about these deliverers in Scripture, we see that God’s people were often impatient, just like we so often are. And so instead of waiting for God to raise up a leader of His choosing for them, they would drudge up their own. They sought out their own solutions instead of seeking God’s perfect will. \n\nThat’s what’s happening in this passage with Jephthah. God didn’t raise up Jephthah to be Israel’s leader.  Instead Jephthah, who had surrounded himself with worthless men (Judges 11:3), got the call to lead from the elders. He wasn’t raised up by God—he was urged to leadership by men who were gripped with fear and desperation.\n\nThat should have been their first red flag: the desire to circumvent God’s way of doing things. David later explained it this way, “Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain” (Psalm 127:1). But it’s hard to wait on God, and it seems much easier to just get on with our own solutions. However, apart from God, our own solutions can go terrifically wrong. But God is also kind, and He often forestalls judgment as we find our way back to Him.\n\nJephthah wasn’t a totally bad guy. He knew the Scriptures, and he knew the history of Israel. He tried to get the land back and reclaim Israel’s territories. But, like you and me, while Jephthah loved goodness and sought to do right, he also had some sneaky, low-dealing tendencies.\n\nThe combination of human error and ignoring God’s way brings us to Jephthah’s horrifically rash vow. I don’t know if human sacrifice was on his mind when he made the extravagant promise, or why he persisted in carrying out the vow after he realized his daughter would be its victim. But it’s a chilling image of what can happen when a people ignore God’s way and stubbornly turn away from His principles. Jephthah took his bad promise too far, and a celebration was turned into a funeral.\n\nMay the Lord protect our hearts from rushing to do things—even good things—our own way and on our own terms. May He give us courage to relent and humility to repent when we make bad decisions. May we lean on His strength and His promises, not our own, and may our “yes” mean “yes,” and our “no” mean “no” (Matthew 5:36-37). We can stop and turn our hearts toward Him. Even when it seems like we are already too committed to our own way, God waits to lead us back to His.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Israel’s Rebellion and Repentance",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Wynter Pitts\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 10:1-18, Isaiah 30:15, Luke 15:11-32\n\nMy mother became a Christian when she was just a few months pregnant with me. I now realize she literally grew in her relationship with Christ while simultaneously teaching and leading me as she learned. In short, I grew up learning a lot about God. I participated in Bible memory contests, collected money for missionaries around the world, and had a part in both Christmas and Easter performances annually. My mother led me the best she knew how, yet I still rebelled.\n\nI knew biblical principles,\nbut I did not apply them to my everyday life.\nI knew the Bible as God’s Word, that He is the Creator of the universe,\nbut I did not honor Him as my Father.\nI knew Jesus lived a perfect, holy, and blameless life,\nbut I did not know He loves me even though I cannot do the same.\nI knew Jesus died to save the world from sin,\nbut I did not live as God’s forgiven daughter.\n\nHaving knowledge of God and choosing to live a life that honors Him are two very different things, and they will lead to two very different life experiences. This is exactly what is happening in today’s passage. There is no mistaking that the Israelites knew God. Judges 10:11 reminds us they had experienced His deliverance, His protection, and His love over and over again. Yet time after time they forsook the God they knew, preferring the comforts of what they could see and touch. They chose the false gods and cultural influences of surrounding nations over their faithful God. \n\nOur struggles today remain the same. While we may not be tempted to worship the god of Baal, our false gods are just as dangerous. The tangible items we are so tempted to chase—money, people, success—are just as dishonoring when worshiped in place of the one true God. God did not want the Israelites to simply know of Him. He wanted them to know Him personally, to trust Him, confide in Him, and find their lives in Him. God wants the same for us now; He wants His people to choose Him.\n\nIt’s easy to look at the stories we read in the Bible and wonder how God’s people could experience His patience, love, and miraculous intervention and yet still put their trust in other things. It’s easy to point the finger in judgment, but it would be far more beneficial for us to reflect on our own idolatry. In doing so, we will likely find places in our own hearts where we need to repent, seeking forgiveness and healing from the God who longs to be gracious to us (Isaiah 30:18). \n\nGod is compassionate and merciful. He provides leadership, guidance, and personal opportunities to experience His love. But as His children, we must take action, choosing to surrender to Him and worship Him with our lives. The ultimate provision of His faithful love comes in the very person of Jesus Christ—the sure image of the invisible God the Israelites so longed for and the Savior we all need. He alone stands by ready to rescue. In our surrender to Him, we will experience the deliverance, forgiveness, compassion, and rest promised to His children (Isaiah 30:15).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 9:1-57, Psalm 68:11-14, John 4:19-24\n\nThe book of Judges is bleak, but chapter 9 is particularly devastating. A passage like this forces us to see the devastation that bad men can wreak. Sometimes the only appropriate response to something like this is, “How long, O Lord?” That is my posture today. \n\nGideon died and the people of Israel once again worshiped Baal, the fake god. When he passed, Gideon left behind seventy (yes, 70) sons. Abimelech was one of those sons, born to a prostitute and bent on being king. So he killed all but one of his brothers (Jotham), and rallied the people of Shechem to make him king. \n\nAbimelech was awful and opportunistic, a greedy and prideful man. Knowing this, Jotham floated him a warning in the form of a parable: A forest of cedar trees wanted a king, and so they asked an olive tree, fig tree, and grape vine to do the job. All three declined, and instead asked the trees of the forest to consider what it would be like to no longer produce the fruit that pleases both people and God. \n\nTurns out the olive tree, fig tree, and grape vine knew their place and their calling; they were content in the roles given to them by the Lord. But the bramble, an opportunistic and destructive plant, said yes—he would be their king (vv. 7–15). One commentary I read compared the bramble to the Southern vine kudzu, which ruthlessly takes over anything in its path. Jotham knew Abimelech would do the same. \n\nGod sought vengeance for the murder of Abimelech’s brothers, sending “an evil spirit between Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem” (v. 22). A man named Gaal started a coup against him, and when Abimelech learned of the plot to overthrow him, he unleashed a violent terror against his people. He “razed the city and sowed it with salt” (v. 45), making it infertile land, destroying it not just for the present, but for generations after. To round out his wrath, he burned a tower filled with people, killing more than a thousand.\n\nAbimelech’s anger would echo for decades. We don’t know exactly how Abimelech salted the earth, but Scripture describes just how destructive this practice might have been, leaving behind soil as a “burning waste of sulfur and salt, unsown, producing nothing, with no plant growing on it” (Deuteronomy 29:23). \n\nThis is the definition of “scorched earth,” a turn-of-phrase typically reserved for military strategies. It is Sherman’s march to the sea in the Civil War and the campaign of Agent Orange in the Vietnam War. It is the devastation we see throughout both history and Scripture. It leaves us to cry out, “How long, O Lord?” \n\nSin has scorched the whole earth, and our whole hearts. It leaves nothing to satisfy us. We are only refreshed, rebuilt, and renewed when we look to Jesus. He is the only One who can water a scorched earth and a hardened heart, and He does. And He will. Thanks be to God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 8:1-35, Deuteronomy 20:5-8, 1 Corinthians 1:18-31\n\nWhere did we get the idea that the battle should be easy? Why did we start calling the Christian life a “walk” when it is more like a war? After all, “our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this darkness, against evil, spiritual forces in the heavens” (Ephesians 6:12). \n\nYes, we’re the sheep of God’s flock (Psalm 95:7), the tiny chicks He tucks up under His wings (Psalm 91:4) and His dearly loved children (Ephesians 5:1). But these tender images don’t tell the whole story. We are warriors, enlisted for battle against an enemy bent on rebellion against God and the destruction of His image bearers. Truth, peace, faith, and salvation are standard issue armor for Christ’s followers (Ephesians 6:14-17). Why fit us for battle if we’ll never be expected to fight?\n\nIn Judges 8 we find Gideon serving as the general of God’s army. He’s already led the charge in a battle that left the enemy bleeding and scattered (Judges 7:19-25). From our view on the sidelines, we wouldn’t have faulted this band of brothers if they’d simply let the remaining rebels limp away toward the hills. Instead we find them in hot pursuit. The front of darkness had been pushed back, yet they knew the fighting was not over. They were worn out, battle weary, low on energy and strength, and yet they pursued because there was still an enemy at large.\n\nThese words from Gideon’s story have sunk deeply into my gut: “exhausted yet pursuing” (v.4, ESV). They jar me into remembering that for the army of God, the orders haven’t changed. Until Christ returns for us, there will always been skirmishes between flesh and blood, good and evil, light and darkness. There will be times when God’s strength will empower us to push back the front of darkness, but the enemy hasn’t yet raised the flag of surrender. And in the words of Bible teacher Kay Arthur, “There’s no retirement in the time of war.”\n\nAs long as our enemy is on the run and still gunning for the people of God, retirement isn’t an option. Though we may find ourselves weary and worn out from the battle, or celebrating a God-given victory, let us not sit back and rest on our laurels. Let us raise our swords and keep fighting.\n\nFighting for truth.\n\nFighting for hope.\n\nFighting for love.\n\nFighting to make the gospel known.\n\nIn other words, “Let us not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don’t give up” (Galatians 6:9). Until the Lord blasts His trumpet, signaling the final fall of our enemy, may He find us like Gideon’s army—exhausted yet pursuing, and empowered by the strength of our Savior, who “is the power and the wisdom of God” (1 Corinthians 1:24).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Gideon’s Army",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 7:1-25, Isaiah 41:10, Ephesians 6:10\n\nWhen was the last time you were in a battle you could not win without divine intervention?\n\nIt’s hard for me to find an answer. Sure, I enjoy the occasional challenge, but I like to keep those challenges to a minimum, so I can feel capable and in control. And if I’m honest, I’m happy with this life of manageable risks—enough to create some drama, but not so much that it requires great faith. There’s an underlying pride to living like this, because when things go well, I can answer, “Oh that’s easy. I did it myself.”\n\nNews flash: God doesn’t need me, and He doesn’t need you.\n\nI know that sounds harsh, but that’s kind of the point of Judges 7. I wonder if that’s what Gideon told his men that day as they prepared to face down the greatest enemy of their time. “Are you scared? You can leave. God doesn’t need you.” In that one moment, two-thirds of Gideon’s army walked away. Can you imagine? You’re standing there, covered in armor, and the person to your left and your right both leave. The field must have felt very empty. \n\nBut God wasn’t done whittling down the troops. He told Gideon to take his men to the water and split them into “kneelers” and “lappers.” Commentaries disagree about the “How do they drink water?” test; some argue that it was an arbitrary way to narrow down the fighting force quickly, while others wonder if the “lappers” let down their guard. Could it be that God chose to use the most irresponsible men to make the victory that much more miraculous? Regardless, what was a force of more than 30,000 at the beginning of the day had been narrowed to just 300.\n\nWe know how this story ends, but the men in Gideon’s army did not. And as much as God reassured them, on paper it was a suicide mission. This risk didn’t require strength or chariots or better weapons or more “hustle.” It required faith in divine intervention. It required them to rely on God alone, to “be strengthened by the Lord and by his vast strength” (Ephesians 6:10).\n\nThe men who went into the valley needed faith, but the men who were sent away needed it just the same. I can imagine their startled disbelief as Gideon pointed them away from the water. “Wait! We’re the fearless ones! Surely God needs us!” But He didn’t, and those men needed to know where their power came from. For the men who left and the men who went down into the valley, God’s strength combined with their faith led to an epic victory.\n\nGod loves you, but He doesn’t need you. And that isn’t harsh news—it’s freedom. No matter how deep the valley, no matter how big the army you’re up against, He’s not waiting for you to build some spiritual muscle in order to handle that challenge. He already has the strength. All He needs if for you to have faith in Him—whether He’s calling you to face it or walk away.\n\nGideon wasn’t the only warrior who God sent seemingly outnumbered into battle. In the war for our souls, God sent His Son Jesus to take down humanity’s greatest enemy. Jesus went into the valley alone,  voluntarily laying down His life, taking the punishment we deserve, so we could claim His victory over death as our own. This is how strong our God is. Nothing can stand up to Him. Not even death itself.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Lord Calls Gideon",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 6:1-40, Psalm 127:1, James 1:16-17\n\nWhen we read Judges 6, we see that Gideon is certainly having a low moment. We find this youngest son from the weakest tribe crouching in the winepress trying to thresh wheat in secret, so the mighty Midianite army won’t get a whiff of his harvest and swoop down to steal it. All of Israel was feeling abandoned by God and their hearts were confused and resentful. Every time they tried to get back up, they were gleefully knocked down by some neighboring pagan army. God’s chosen people wondered if He had given up on them and chosen someone else to love, protect, and set apart for Himself.\n\nBut Israel wasn’t down because God had forgotten them. They were hiding in caves because they had stubbornly and persistently chased after evil for many years. They had established traditions and patterns that avoided God altogether. The paths their feet traced in their homes and in their towns led them in the ways of wickedness. They were in a rut, and it’s hard to look up and figure your way out of habitual sin.\n\nIt takes something dramatic to turn our hearts back toward God.\n\nGideon was trudging his sweaty rut like the rest of Israel, when an angel of the Lord appeared to him. Why would an angel appear to him? It wasn’t because Gideon was the one honorable man among thousands; it was because God’s time was right to raise up a leader in Israel. It is God who marks the seasons, who raises up leaders, and who brings down empires. “Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor over it in vain” (Psalm 127:1). All other planning and plotting is futile. \n\nI’ve never had to hide from an army, but I have had some low moments. I’m sure many of us can remember feeling confused and resentful at some point. In spite of our doubts and ruts, and the habitual trails that lead us to wickedness, God can lift us up to victory with Him. Gideon didn’t just decide to grit his teeth and pitch his military plan to the leaders. God chose him, called him, and promised him victory “as if Mideon were one man” (Judges 6:16).\n\nWhatever your circumstances may be today, don’t let them scare you. Don’t let the worn pathways of sin lure you into hopelessness. Don’t be deceived by the voices that tell you that your sin is too great, that your habits can never be broken. Our God can rescue and redeem even the most lost. He is light in the blackest night. Run to the One who controls the sea and the stars, and trust Him with your darkest secrets. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Emily Chapman Richards\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 4:1-24, Judges 5:1-31, Job 19:25-27, Psalm 68:7-10\n\nMy husband and I have the privilege of shepherding three little ladies through life, and our evenings often end with the same bedtime ritual. We read a story, pray together, and sing. For my middle daughter, it is quite important that we sing the same three songs every evening: “Before the Throne of God Above,” “Magnificat,” and “The Lord’s Prayer”—usually in that order. If I’m honest, this sometimes frustrates me. Why can’t we have some variety in our song choice? But, as I continued to think through today’s readings, I have come to see our same three songs in a new light. \n\nThe book of Judges recounts the tragedy of forgetfulness. It is a story of the Israelites’ downward spiral, culminating in Judges 21:25: “In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did whatever seemed right to him.” However, there is a momentary break in this downward spiral with the arrival of Deborah. \n\nWe first meet Deborah in Judges 4. She is sitting under a tree conducting business as usual, judging and prophesying. The Israelites, having suffered oppression at the hands of the Canaanites for twenty years, cry out to the Lord for deliverance. He inclines His ear, and speaking through Deborah, reveals a rescue plan by way of a woman named Jael, who ultimately kills King Jabin’s military leader, Sisera. This victory sets in motion the unraveling of Canaan’s defense and, ultimately, makes way for the Israelites to enjoy forty years of peace—double the amount of time they originally spent under King Jabin’s oppression. \n\nWhat is Deborah and Barak’s response? They break out into a victory song! They sing, detailing how God provided deliverance from their enemies. But their praise did more than serve as a celebration in that moment. It became a vehicle for future generations to remember God’s faithfulness. Compared to the rest of the book in its entirety, the song of Judges 5 interrupts the narrative flow, and is an intentional break in the story for the purpose of remembering. Like David in Psalm 68, Deborah and Barak are recalling and recounting the faithfulness of God. May we do the same. \n\nMay we remember what God has done: “God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the desert… You, God, showered abundant rain; you revived your inheritance when it languished” (Psalm 68:7,9). \n\nMay we remember what God is doing: “Israel’s leaders took charge, and the people gladly followed. Praise the LORD!” (Judges 5:2).\n\nMay we remember what God has promised to do: “But I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the end he will stand on the dust… I will see him myself; my eyes will look at him, and not as a stranger” (Job 19:25,27).\n\nWhich brings me back to those same three songs my family sings together at bedtime. We, like the Israelites, are tempted to forget, to lose sight of who we are and why we are here. It is our remembrance of what God has done for us that fights forgetfulness and propels us forward in our mission as followers of Jesus. May today, tomorrow, and all the days we’ve been given, be spent singing the praises of our holy, just, and infinitely loving God. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Lord Tests Israel",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nJust over a hundred years ago, a funny belief began to crop up among Western Christians. In Europe especially, Christians had enjoyed a long season of prosperity and peace, which began to shape their theology. They concluded that humans were evolving, outgrowing the bad habits of violence, war, and sin. Humans, they reasoned, were essentially good, and getting better with every generation.\n\nWhat these Christians developed was a weak view of sin and an idealistic view of human nature, and it remained popular for a while. It shaped Christians’ faith and the way they read Scripture, but it didn’t last very long. In 1914, the world was plunged into World War I, which shattered all of those illusions. As it turned out, humans were not evolving out of sin. In fact, we were no different than any generation before us. If anything, humans were only “advancing” in our technology for fighting each other. \n\nThis bit of Church history is good to keep in mind while reading the book of Judges, because it demonstrates a principle we will see again and again. Old Testament scholar Walter Brueggemann once wrote, “Prosperity breeds amnesia,” and there is perhaps no better description of what happened to Christians a century ago, and what happened to the Israelites in Judges. Every time the Israelites prospered, they didn’t simply forget God; they forgot what it means to be human in the world. They forgot their own sin. They forgot the world’s brokenness. And they forgot how desperately they needed God. So they lived as if they didn’t.  \n\nWe should never be too quick to explain the stories of violence and suffering in Judges. Neat and tidy answers almost always do a disservice to these difficult passages. That said, it is safe to say that the cycle of foreign invasions had an eye-opening effect on the Israelites, in the same way that World War I shattered the rose-colored glasses of idealistic Christians. When God tested “all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars” (Judges 3:1), you can’t help but wonder if this was another way of saying, “In the absence of war, the Israelites had forgotten. They had forgotten their weakness. They had forgotten their vulnerability. They had forgotten that they needed God.” \n\nIt was true then and it is still true today: prosperity breeds amnesia. In times of comfort, we do not simply forget God, but we also forget the seriousness of sin, the brokenness of this world, and why we so desperately need a Savior to mend it. That said, this kind of forgetting is one that most people in the world are never afforded. In regions of famine and civil war, it’s impossible to ignore that this world is not as it should be. But for those of us living in relative comfort, who rarely bump up against the jagged edges of this fractured planet, we can forget just how devastating the effects of sin have been.\n\nThat is one lesson we can take from Judges. It challenges us not only to remember God, but to remember our brokenness and the brokenness of the world. When we downplay sin, we downplay grace, and we downplay our dependency on it. So as ugly and horrible as suffering can be, and as much as it grieves God most of all, through it we can detect the still, small voice of the Spirit whispering to us: “This is why you need a Savior. This is why I came.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 2:1-23, Deuteronomy 4:9, 2 Timothy 2:2\n\nIn Judges 2, we read about two generations of Israelites: the Joshua generation and the post-Joshua generation. Joshua’s generation was faithful. Scripture says, “The people worshiped the LORD throughout Joshua’s lifetime and during the lifetimes of the elders who outlived Joshua. They had seen all the LORD’s great works He had done for Israel” (Judges 2:7).\n\nHowever, the post-Joshua generation was not faithful. After Joshua’s death and after the death of the elders who outlived him, this generation rose up as one who “did not know the LORD or the works He had done for Israel.” Therefore, they “did what was evil in the LORD’s sight” (Judges 2:10-11).\n\nOne generation had witnessed the great works the Lord had done for His people on their journey to claiming the promised land—the other had not. Because of this, this new generation turned from God to worship idols instead.\n\nIn graduate school, I had a good friend who was an atheist. We often talked about faith and Christianity. He thought it was odd that Christians felt the need to gather together once a week. “If the whole Jesus story is really true,” he said, “why do you all need to gather once a week to remind each other of it?”\n\nIt was a good question. At the time, I didn’t have a good answer, but I think Judges 2 speaks to this question. When we don’t remember the works of the Lord, we turn from him, and because we are made for worship, we look for other gods to worship. Like the children of Israel began to worship the gods of the Canaanites, we may begin to worship the gods our friends are worshiping, or the gods the media tells us to worship. We can easily lose sight of the one true God.\n\nThis is why Christians gather each Sunday and tell the same story again and again. This is why we drink from the cup and eat the bread. Jesus said, “Do this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19). He wanted us to remember, because He knew what would happen if we forgot.\n\nI don’t know what happened between Joshua’s generation and the next. Did they stop telling the story of what the Lord had done? Did this generation not hear about the parting of the Red Sea? The manna? The cloud that led the people by day and the pillar of fire that led them by night? Did they not heed this charge in Deuteronomy?\n\nBe on your guard and diligently watch yourselves, so that you don’t forget the things your eyes have seen and so that they don’t slip from your mind as long as you live.\n\nTeach them to your children and your grandchildren.\n- Deuteronomy 4:9\n\nWe don’t really know the answer. What we do know is one generation was faithful to God because they had seen what the Lord had done. The next generation was not, because they did not know what the Lord had done.\n\nHow grateful I am for those who’ve gone before me, telling their children of the great works the Lord has done. How thankful I am for those children, who then went on to tell their children about God, until the story trickled down through generations into a Church that is still gathering, still remembering, still passing the cup.\n\nLord, help us to remember your works and to never stop telling others about Your goodness. In continuing to worship You, the one true God, may we bring you glory, so the next generation might do the same.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessica Lamb\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 1:1-36, Genesis 49:8-12, Psalm 34:17\n\nI still remember the misguided giddiness I felt when my eighth grade English teacher announced we would be reading Romeo and Juliet. I knew little of Shakespeare at the time, beyond the belief that he was someone I should read and appreciate. All I really knew of the star-crossed pair was that they, and their love story, were famous. \n\nSo when I came to the end of the play, I was livid. Romeo and Juliet were both dead, and there was no happily ever after. What sort of love story was this? \n\nIt isn’t one, really. It’s a tragedy. Every twist and turn that leads to the demise of the young couple is meant to bring an ache to our hearts, because we realize how easily it could have been avoided. We’re meant to feel upset and distressed at the ending. That’s how tragedy works.\n\nThe book of Judges is the tragic, true story of the people of Israel ignoring God’s instructions, and then abandoning their faith to live like their pagan neighbors. After God’s people endured 400 years of slavery in Egypt, followed by forty years of wandering in the wilderness, Joshua led Israel into the promised land. Toward the end of his life, Joshua warned the Israelites to worship the Lord and serve Him only, and instructed them to drive the Canaanite people out of the land, so they would not be tempted to follow a false religion (Joshua 24:14-15). \n\nBut these opening verses in the book of Judges warn us that the Israelites didn’t obey. They repeated the sins of the Egyptians and enslaved the Canaanite people. They failed to drive the Canaanites out completely, and failed to fully establish a land of their own. And like the opening lines of Romeo and Juliet, we are warned that what we are about to read is a tragedy. \n\nIn Judges, the people of Israel forsake the Lord and adopt the worship practices of the Canaanites. They experience chaos and catastrophe in a time of unprecedented violence and oppression, led by mostly corrupt and cowardly judges. The Israelites become almost unrecognizable as the people of God. And then the book of Judges abruptly ends, with everyone doing whatever seems right to them (17:6). As readers, we’re left with a sense of longing for how things ought to be.\n\nBut God continues to work. The book of Ruth tells us that during this time, famine in Israel sent Naomi’s family to Moab, where her son married a woman named Ruth before he died. Ruth, a Moabite, pledged to stay with Naomi, an Israelite, and embrace the God of Israel. She went on to give birth to Obed, King David’s grandfather. From this lineage came Jesus, the Savior of the world. Our hope, the hope of all creation, is rooted in a foreign widow’s decision to follow God during the bleak time of the judges.\n\nI pray that as we read Judges, we will discover the source of true redemption, and turn back to the One who redeems. For when “the righteous cry out… the LORD hears, and rescues them from all their troubles” (Psalm 34:17).\n\nWe can draw hope from the fact that God continues to work through morally compromised, deeply flawed people and circumstances. He isn’t limited by our shortcomings. He isn’t stopped by the brokenness in our world. His story—and because of Him, our story—is not one of tragedy, but one of profound beauty and hope in Jesus Christ. Thanks be to God.\n\n\n\n",

Fox with feathered hair and a sweater vest. No? If you didn’t grow up under the tutelage of ‘80s sitcoms, all you need to know is this: Alex P. Keaton and family always had a little drama brewing. But, thirty minutes and some live studio-audience laughter later, things seemed to work themselves out. \n\nAlas, you and I aren’t living in an ‘80s sitcom. Real life is happening and we’re in the thick of it. Relationship issues don’t always resolve with a sincere side hug, and problems aren’t limited to finding a date for the school dance. \n\nLife is hard. It is beautiful, yes; but gosh, is it hard. Dear friends suffering from deep depression, family members whose loss stings as sharply as when their loved one first left, children who are hungry and enslaved around the world, and wars that rage on for reasons long forgotten. Not to mention the stack of dishes in the sink, the pile of unpaid bills on the counter, and the decision you just can’t bear to make. \n\nLife is hard.\n\nThe book of Ruth is a book about real life. It is the story of a family and of one woman in particular. She was loyal and loving, hardworking and humble—an ordinary woman who led an ordinary life. Ruth’s ordinary story is much like yours and mine; it bears the fingerprints of an extraordinary God. \n\nJust five verses in, the scene is set for the story, and straightaway you can tell it’s not a happily-ever-after kind of tale. Naomi has lost her husband, a loss with serious implications for a woman in her culture. Then, just ten years later, she loses both of her sons, too. Now, she is a childless widow, with no means for caring for herself or her two surviving daughters-in-law. \n\nThis is a real-life story of real-life suffering. And let’s be honest—doesn’t that bring you a little relief? It is not a story of kings or princes, great leaders or stunning turns of events. This is just the story of a family facing loss, grief, and uncertainty, and the God who cares intimately about it all, every single detail. \n\nLet’s venture into this story set in the very town where Christ would be born. Let’s enter into the life of this unconventional family, ordinary folk God would use to bring about the coming of His kingdom in Christ Jesus. And let’s see what God has to teach us about His faithfulness right here, in our hard and beautiful life. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Ruth 1:6-18, Hosea 2:18-23\n\nI did a terrible thing to my mother-in-law.  \n\nI took her son away. She and my father-in-law were very gracious, and they let him go. I understand that we raise children up to let them go. Indeed, I think few things are more joyful than to see children well-married. But now that I’m a mother of sons, I’ve got my dander up just thinking about some young floozy batting her eyes at my boys.\n\nI’m very fortunate to have a creative, intelligent, and godly mother-in-law. (She might read this, and she’s quite a woman, y’all!) Nevertheless, it’s not a relationship that comes easily. This delicate relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law doesn’t feel like home right away. \n\nRuth’s husband died; her beautiful boy was gone, and with him the tenuous thread that tied her to Naomi was poised to unravel too. Imagine Ruth, Orpah, and Naomi sitting around the metaphorical kitchen table, staring at their hands. Together, but alone, the bonds that held them together seemingly gone. Each wilting under her own personal loss. What happens next? How do we pick up the pieces from this?\n\nRuth chooses Naomi. That’s her next step. It’s so unexpected. She could have stayed in her hometown, with her own people. But no, she said, “Let your people be my people!” (Ruth 1:16). Imagine giving up your home and relocating across the country to live with your mother-in-law. It’s a bold move.\n\nRuth binds herself to her mother-in-law, vowing to do six things with Naomi: travel, dwell, claim her people, worship her God, die where she dies, and be buried where she is buried. Ruth is not messing around. She could have just said, “Okay, let’s go. I’ll check it out and see if it’s for me.” Nope, Ruth was ALL IN.  \n\nThis decision to stay with Naomi is so all-encompassing because it is a decision to follow the God of Israel. God uses this mother-in-law relationship unexpectedly, just as he plants Ruth quite unexpectedly in the genealogy of Christ. He used Naomi to woo Ruth to the one true God. She is in love, not with Naomi’s beauty, riches, or good humor, but her wisdom, virtue, and grace. Naomi preserves these in spite of the huge loss of her husband and sons.\n\nGod was doing a mighty work in Naomi.\n\nRuth didn’t want her brush with the God of Israel to end.\n\nSo Ruth clung to Naomi—the one person who linked her to the God of Israel.\n\nWhat kind of God is this who could draw us, against all odds, into what seems like the least comforting of circumstances? He is the God who offers comfort in sorrow, bread in a time of famine, blessing in a season of barrenness, and joy that overcomes all sorrow. He is the God of good news. This is what Ruth saw in Naomi and in Naomi’s God. This is why she joyfully concludes, “Let your God be my God!”\n\n",

Have you ever uttered “pray for me” and meant “pray instead of me, because I just can’t do it”? \n\nIf prayer is a picture of believers lifting one another before the Lord, there are times I have been full-on carried. I don’t mean they’ve just walked alongside me or encouraged me to go on. No, they have picked me up from the pit and held me high before the Lord, my spiritual self limp and lifeless, desperately in need of the life-breath of my Savior. It sounds melodramatic until you’re in the thick of it, too spent to sigh another “please” or “amen.”\n\nThis kind of spiritual and physical exhaustion is what I see when I picture Naomi walking into town that day, so affected by her suffering that she is hardly recognizable. The townswomen whispered to one another, shocked at the condition of the friend they used to know. Naomi quickly set them straight. “It’s over for me,” she said. “Don’t call me Pleasant. Call me Bitter” (Ruth 1:20, my paraphrase).\n\nNaomi’s circumstances were indeed awful. She’d buried her husband, lost two sons, and said goodbye to a daughter-in-law. She had no hope of a grandchild, no path of provision. “I went away full,” she told them, “and the Lord has brought me back empty” (Ruth 1:21). Yet, there was no fist-shaking at heaven. No renouncing her faith. Naomi believed God was sovereign, even in her tragedy. \n\nBut even this believing woman had trouble seeing past her circumstances. The hand was dealt, the credits were rolling. Naomi believed with her head that her God was sovereign, but she was too soul-weary to believe with her heart. And so she called it. Game over. Name changed. \n\nNaomi could not imagine being filled back up. She couldn’t picture her daughter-in-law remarried to an upstanding man who would welcome them both into his family. She couldn’t dream of holding a grandson in her arms. She couldn’t imagine how bitterness could become beauty, but her sovereign God could.\n\nNaomi named herself Bitter, but God names her—and us!—Blessed.\n\nHe names us Forgiven (1 John 1:9).\n\nHe names us Beloved (Romans 5:8).\n\nHe names us Redeemed (Ephesians 1:7).\n\nThese names hold true even when circumstances don’t, because ours is a God who is mighty over affliction and blessing, bitterness and beauty, past and future. \n\nThe same woman who walked into her hometown deflated of joy and hope, nevertheless trusted herself and her daughter-in-law to the Lord’s keeping. “Go ahead, my daughter,” Naomi said to Ruth, sending her out into the fields to gather up God’s provision. And provide, He would. Their circumstances were anything but good, but their God was always good. \n\nCircumstances change, but they do not change our God. And they do not change the saving power of Jesus Christ. We need not waste time shaking our fists at heaven when we can run full-force into His arms, trusting He can redeem even us, even this, even now.\n\nWe are not named by our circumstances. We are named by our good God. \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Ruth 2:4-17, Deuteronomy 28:8-9, Psalm 36:7-9\n\nI’m grinning as I sit in the coffee shop typing this. Thankfully, there’s no one at the table facing mine. \n\nI can’t help it. This story is why I can’t get enough of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Because do you know who is declared royalty in the eyes of God? A poor, Moabite widow gleaning barley. I can’t even stand it, I love this story so much.\n\nLet me back up and explain. Here we have our dear Ruth, busting her tail in the barley fields in an honest effort to keep herself and her mother-in-law alive. She “happened” into the field of Boaz. And he “happened” to take notice of her. And (spoiler alert) all these little happenings will end up with Ruth and Boaz at the marriage altar one day, a beautiful ending to an abrupt and terrible life twist. \n\nThe thing is, none of this was happenstance. The hand of a gracious God led Naomi back to Bethlehem and led Ruth to go with her. The hand of a gracious God led Ruth to Boaz’s fields that first day and turned Boaz’s heart toward the hard-working widow from a foreign land. What appeared as coincidence was God’s hand continually at work. \n\nIn the same upside-down way of the gospel, Ruth’s simple and consistent acts of faithfulness have Kingdom-size ramifications. \n\nRuth was not some long-time, super-religious believer who earned herself a spot in God’s capital-S Story (and even in the lineage of Christ!). She was just a young woman doing hard things because she believed it was what she was called to do. We don’t hear this in her words, but we see it in her actions. Her faithfulness is not bright and shiny; her work is not award-winning or perfectly planned. She was simply following God’s lead, taking the next right step.\n\nLike Ruth, we cannot see the whole of our story, let alone His Story. We aren’t meant to. But we can follow God’s lead, knowing that our yeses to Him make a Kingdom-size difference, even when no one sees.\n\nAre you sitting in a quiet apartment this morning, wondering if your next steps matter? Are you driving to an office where you’ll work tirelessly without thanks or appreciation, just like yesterday? Are you settling in for another day at home, serving little hearts in a million unnoticed ways? \n\nHear these words from Boaz to Ruth as my prayer over you today:\n\n“May the Lord reward you for what you have done, and may you receive a full reward from the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge.”\n– Ruth 2:12\n\nAnd as you do the work set before you, know this: Your small and steady acts of faithfulness are being used in big and beautiful ways in the kingdom of God.  \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Ruth 2:18-23, Deuteronomy 7:7-9, Psalm 41:1-3\n\nTo a kindergartener, riding the bus is no small thing. In fact, riding the bus seems to be the bookend horror of my education—terrifying when I was 6 and mortifying when I was 16. (Thanks again, Mom and Dad.) \n\nWhen I was in kindergarten, the buses weren’t identified by numbers, but by animals. I rode the squirrel bus—not to be confused with the chipmunk bus my best friend rode to her house on the other side of town—and was required to wear a luggage tag flaunting an illustrated picture of the animal on my backpack. \n\nEvery day at 3 pm, the school bell would ring and we’d file outside to our animal-specific location, and every day I remember the same tears, wailing, and resistance. One fellow kindergartener, a curly-haired boy with a blue backpack, was not happy with his assigned position in the bus-zone zoo. “I WANT TO RIDE THE MANATEE BUSSSS!,” he’d wail until his face matched the color of his backpack. \n\nNow, I don’t know if the appeal of this particular bus was the swimming sea cow itself (understandable), a cute passenger with pigtails, or a problem with the squirrel bus he’d been assigned to (also understandable). But one thing was clear: the boy was decidedly discontent. \n\nI may have kept my cool about the squirrel bus, but I, too, become decidedly discontent more often than I’d care to admit. This is especially true when it comes to the love story of Ruth and Boaz. I mean, promise me a Boaz and my single-girl self will run, not walk, to the closest field and gather grain just like Ruth did. That probably wouldn’t work for me, but does that mean God is a better provider to Ruth than He is to me?\n\nWe must decide a few things here: God is either the ultimate Provider, or not at all. He is either in the business of redemption, or He is off the clock altogether. His hand is either strong, or it is weak. He either chose us, or He rejected us. There is no sliding scale according to our worthiness. In fact, His love for us and devotion to us rests on His faithfulness, not ours (Deuteronomy 7:7-9).\n\nNo matter where our feet rest, we are always standing in the field of God’s provision. \n\nI’m reminded of the ways the teachers on bus duty tried to reason with Manatee Boy.  \n\nThey’d say, “That bus isn’t going to take you home, but here’s the one that is!” \n\nThe same is true for us. God’s provision is a vehicle to His perfect will. Maybe unexpected kindness comes to you in the form of a Boaz, or maybe it looks a little different—a new job, a needed friend, a resolved conflict. Either way, our strong Provider is always present, giving His children what they need.\n\nEither way, we’re all headed home.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Ruth 3:1-13, Ephesians 5:22-32, 2 Corinthians 11:2\n\nEverybody has awkward first dates. Right?  \n\nNaomi set Ruth up on an incredibly intimate and awkward first date. First of all, she tells Ruth to go to the threshing floor. In the ancient world, the threshing floor was sometimes like the middle school bleachers. In fact, the threshing floor was often a place where folks went to make whoopie (Hosea 9:1).\n\nBut whoopie was far from Naomi’s scheme for Ruth that night. There is no indecency in her set up. Rather, it’s a chaste plan to find Ruth’s kinsman-redeemer (Ruth 2:20). Naomi wants to find a husband for Ruth; she wants Ruth to be at rest. And with the right partner, marriage is rest!\n\nBoaz was a good guy. He was a farmer with weathered face and hands, and on this day he was winnowing. Winnowing means “party time” because it’s the final step in separating the barley from the chaff. The harvest was finally ready, and he and his workers were having a well-earned celebration.\n\nBoaz was a good boss. He worked with the harvesters, then ate and drank and celebrated with them. The boss doesn’t have to get his hands dirty, but great bosses aren’t too proud to serve when they are needed. Then he went to bed at a good hour, so that he was already asleep by midnight. He was all set to be ready for work again the next morning. Oh, Boaz—so responsible!\n\nBoaz was a plain man. He lay out in the barley that night, not because he didn’t have a bed, but to guard his harvest and to be close to work tomorrow. He was a man’s man. \n\nOkay, so are we totally in love with Boaz now?\n\nNaomi sends Ruth to him. And when you put a man and a woman together alone in the dark, it’s a risk, right? But Naomi knew Boaz was sober-minded and Ruth was chaste. Naomi trusted that Boaz would tell Ruth what to do. \n\nOur dear Ruth creeps onto his farm, uncovers his feet and lies down on the hard ground, waiting for Boaz to wake up and acknowledge her. This date is completely terrifying! She could’ve easily doubted the whole thing, wondering, “What if Naomi was wrong? What if Boaz looks at me and recoils in horror? What if he rejects me?”\n\nI imagine her lying there at his feet, watching the stars in their courses, listening to the wind in the barley, and awaiting either her doom or her redemption.\n\nShe calls to him, “I am Ruth, your maiden; take me under your protecting wing” (Ruth 3:9 MSG). And that night Boaz sends her away no less chaste but much happier than when she came. He gives her the promise of marriage and protection.\n\nWe, too, are sometimes on the cold, hard ground of life, putting our reputation at risk, waiting for our redemption. When we lay ourselves at the feet of our Redeemer, He does not recoil in horror. He does not reject us. He looks at us, small and shivering, and gathers us close to Him. He loves us.\n\nCall out to your Redeemer, who waits to take you under His wing. Lay at His feet and bask in your redemption.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nText: Ruth 3:14-18, Proverbs 31:10-11, Matthew 22:23-33\n\nHave there been times in your life when you’ve felt a strong call by the Lord to pursue something? I have. I often start strong, feeling bold and excited, my heart ready and willing to obey. I can’t help but think, This is it! This is the moment life changes because I said yes! \n\nThen, inevitably, a bend or a bump in the smooth, straight road I envisioned leaves me doubting. But wait. I said yes. I was obedient. So why is this still so hard?\n\nRuth has said all the right yeses in her story. She has been faithful to her mother-in-law Naomi in many ways, but especially so where Boaz is concerned. Ruth has truly put herself out there in trust, and it seems everything has been leading up to this moment. \n\nWhat a surprise it must have been to be told simply to wait—and not for a certain amount of time, but indefinitely. (Indefinite waiting is the worst kind of waiting, if you ask me.) Ruth was instructed to wait until Boaz found the nearer kin, or redeemer, and ask if that man would marry Ruth, per the custom of their culture (Ruth 3:12-13). And who knew how long that would take or what would happen?\n\nWe aren’t told if this frustrated Ruth, but it frustrates me for her. This is the point where I’d likely throw in the towel, caught up in a thought spiral that goes something like this: Well, it’s all over now. I’ll be married to some man I’ve never met, these past few months will have been a total waste, and all I’ll have to show for it is a sore back and some barley. Perfect.\n\nBut Naomi—the same woman who once named herself “Bitter”—offered enough faith for the both of them. She encouraged Ruth, saying, “Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out” (Ruth 3:18).\n\nWait, and then wait again. Isn’t this the way of life? Nowhere are we promised an easy time just because we obey or come to what we believe is a capital-A Answer. But our Father waits too—both with us and for us. His Word says that He longs to be gracious toward us and show us compassion and mercy (Isaiah 30:18). “His steadfast love endures forever,” through all things, all the time, just like the psalm says (Psalm 118).\n\nThis doesn’t mean that things will turn out exactly the way we think they should. But it does mean that God’s hand is always at work in our story, even when we can’t see it. Even when we’re waiting. God’s plan would have still gone ahead of Ruth, even if Boaz came back to say he couldn’t marry her. She would still have been God’s daughter, and His covenant promise to her would still have been true. \n\nIn your waiting place, cling to the hope that God will not leave our stories unfinished or unredeemed. They may not look how we expected but, as with Ruth and Naomi, our story is His story. We can wait with hope, and we can trust and obey with confidence. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

(I say “our Ruth” because we all feel a little bit protective over her at this point, don’t we? Maybe we even see a little of ourselves in her.) And Boaz is pursuing a future with Ruth through the proper channels. He respects the law, and he’s demonstrating over and over again that he is an honorable guy. \n\nBoaz wants this to be legal—for the agreement to be made in plain sight, in the presence of elders. This is a particularly public scene, and it’s a cornerstone in the foundation of the most public scenes in Christian history.\n\nThis narrative almost makes me want to giggle with excitement and nod knowingly. When Boaz fairly and legally earns the right to take Ruth as his wife, the ten elders invoke this awesome, ancient blessing for fruitfulness on their union: “May the Lord make [Ruth] like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you be powerful in Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem” (Ruth 4:11).\n\nYou guys, it’s almost like they knew!\n\nGod reveals a peek at His awesome tapestry when we look at the bigger picture of Boaz and Ruth’s love story. We pull back the curtain and see that Ruth’s decision to follow Naomi was so much more than an address change; it is a tiny piece of God’s grand plan. \n\nThat blessing of fruitfulness would soon bring forth a son, Obed, who would be the father of Jesse. And Jesse’s son was David. (Yep, the guy who slayed Goliath, was anointed king, and wrote many of the Psalms.) David also happens to be the direct ancestor of a baby whose parents returned to their hometown, Bethlehem, to deliver Him in a manger.\n\nJesus. Renowned in Bethlehem, indeed!\n\nRuth and Boaz have an awesome family history of redemption. Even better, through this family tree, the Redeemer—our Redeemer—would come to buy back the world.\n\nChrist has redeemed us like Boaz redeemed Ruth. Their love story is our love story. In the most public way possible, Jesus redeemed us once and for all, a people for His own possession.  \n\nMay we go forward today knowing we are loved so genuinely and so incredibly by the One who redeemed us to be His.\n\nWe are loved, indeed. And we are His.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Life Restored",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Ruth 4:13-17, Psalm 127, Proverbs 24:27\n\nIsn’t it amazing? In just four chapters, we have seen two women move from overwhelming despair to incredible hope. Remember how Naomi interacted with her friends in the first chapter? “‘Don’t call me Naomi. Call me Mara,’ she answered, ‘for the Almighty has made me very bitter. I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty’” (Ruth 1:20-21).\n\nNow, in chapter four, her friends are surrounding her, praising God for the birth of Ruth and Boaz’s son, Obed, another potential kinsman-redeemer in her family tree. What was empty in Naomi’s life is now full, and her friends declare, “Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you this day without a redeemer” (Ruth 4:14). \n\nIn the midst of trial, I am always tempted to think the opposite of what Naomi’s friends declared—that the Lord has left me, and there will be no redemption to my story. We’ve all been there. You might be there right now. \n\nDuring these times, when I don’t know what the future holds, I often try and plan it out myself. Grasping for a sense of control, I make lists, imagine scenarios, send emails, do whatever I need to do to feel like I’m making progress, to feel like I’m fixing my problems, to feel like I am getting somewhere. This is what I would have done had I found myself in a Ruth-and-Naomi situation: widowed, childless, desperate, and staring at a shaky, unclear future. \n\nThe problem with my go-to method of scrambling and planning is not the plan itself, but rather, the overseer of that plan. Me. \n\nPsalm 127 says that when we are building our own house, our labor is in vain. When we are watching over own city, our watching is in vain. The Lord is the only one who knows the plan and has the power to put it into action. Try as we may, we simply get in the way.\n\nNaomi could not have foreseen the beauty that would come from her story of ashes (Isaiah 61:1-3). What God was building was beyond her predictions and planning. Though she lost her sons and her husband, as her friends reminded her, having Ruth as her daughter-in-law turned out to better than having seven sons (Ruth 4:15). \n\nJust as redemption was in God’s plan for Naomi, so is it in God’s plan for us.\n\nDown the bloodline from Boaz and Ruth and Obed is our Redeemer, Jesus. In Christ, there is no such thing as a story beyond redemption. There is only resurrection, restoration, and rejoicing, even in the most unlikely of circumstances and with the most unlikely of subjects. \n\nIf you’re wondering today if the Lord has left you, and the idea redemption at this point feels impossible, hold fast to the promise we see in Ruth and Naomi’s journey. Nothing is too much, too big, or too scary for our Savior. God has not walked away from you. He’s done the opposite. He has drawn near to you through His Son, Jesus. \n\nToday, let’s take a step back today from whatever it is we are trying to control our way out of. Instead of planning and building, let’s sit in the promise of our Redeemer, believing that God is sovereign and His redemption is already ours.\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Ruth 4:18-22, Matthew 1:2-16, Romans 15:12, Luke 3:32-38\n\nHave you ever seen the Bayeux Tapestry? I haven’t seen it in person. It lives in Normandy, France—ooh la la! The tapestry narrates William the Conqueror’s victory at the Battle of Hastings. It’s very famous, very big, and sometimes very beautiful. The top side of it makes sense and tells a story. The underside is a hot mess and looks like the weaver didn’t have a plan.\n\nGod’s will throughout history is like a tapestry. We are underneath looking up, and all the random threads tied in knots and snarls don’t make sense to us. We can’t see the tapestry of history like God sees it. From His perspective it tells the story of His love and plan for mankind from the beginning of time.\n\nOur earthly perspective is limited. So, when God weaves together the family line of Christ, He uses people we would never expect. We assume the line of ancestry for the Son of God would be filled with “respectable” male leaders. But God used women, foreigners, illegitimate children, and a prostitute. (Sidebar: we live in a great world where women can be leaders, but Ruth lived in a world where leaders only looked like serious-faced, respectable men.)\n\nRuth was not only a foreigner; she was from an enemy country, Moab. The Israelites despised the Moabites. So when Ruth walked into town, that’s likely what they saw—a woman with the invisible label of “Moabite” hovering over her head. She herself wasn’t guilty, but she was an easy target for prejudice. And God chose to weave her into His Kingly line. See how the tapestry looks crazy from underneath?\n\nGod makes Ruth an ancestor of David and the Messiah. It is the greatest of  honors. This is the story God was penning all along, from the beginning of the book. \n\nLook at some of the names in Christ’s genealogy:\nPerez\nHezron\nRam\nAmminadab\nNashon\nSalmon\nBoaz\nObed\nJesse\nDavid\n\nDo you know all the people on that list? I don’t. \n\nThe story of Ruth shows us that there are no insignificant people in God’s plan, even if we only know them as a name on a list. He takes the despised and the rejected, the lowly and the insignificant, even His enemies, and He binds them to Christ. \n\nWhat looks messy and meaningless to us is, from God’s perspective, an intentional and precise way He is working to establish His kingdom. He takes what appear to be loose, broken, and unrelated threads and reveals how He was weaving something eternally beautiful all along.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 1:1-2:36, Jeremiah 7:12-14, Luke 1:46-55\n\nI listen to film soundtracks while I work because they somehow help me feel connected to the world of words where I spend my days. The sweeping scores are fuel for my fingers on the keyboard, providing a level of focus and intensity I’m not sure I could achieve in silence. \n\nIn the same way that music brings words to life on my computer screen, the books of 1 & 2 Samuel lend new vibrancy to my reading of Scripture. These ancient words were breathed out by God and remain “living and active” (Hebrews 4:12). Even so, I forget. I can read the words yet fail to see the story. \n\nThis is the story of an eternal King and His eternal kingdom. The epic battles and legendary tales found in 1 & 2 Samuel wake me up to a reality that’s as true for me as it was for David: our God reigns. \n\nThe books of 1 & 2 Samuel tell the stories of Samuel, Saul, and David—three broken heroes used by God to establish a kingdom for His people. Samuel was the revered last judge, Saul the impressive first king of Israel, and David the flawed poet-warrior. But beyond the page-turning adventure of kings and battles and political gamesmanship, these books tell the story of a greater King. The life of David, his defeat of Goliath, and the epic victories of his mighty men all point to the coming of Christ—the true and forever-reigning King.\n\nAnd where does it all begin? With the desperate prayers of a heartbroken woman named Hannah. \n\n“Deeply hurt, Hannah prayed to the Lord and wept with many tears. Making a vow, she pleaded, ‘Lord of Armies, if you will take notice of your servant’s affliction, remember and not forget me, and give your servant a son, I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life…’” (1 Samuel 1:10-11).\n\nI read Hannah’s story and I see myself—not because our struggle is the same, but because our hearts are. Like Hannah, I long for what this imperfect life on earth does not give. Like Hannah, I want to be known and remembered by my God. And while all my prayers to Him are not answered with a “yes,” they are heard and I am known. I am remembered. Just like Hannah. \n\n“My heart rejoices in the Lord;\nmy horn is lifted up by the Lord.\nMy mouth boasts over my enemies,\nbecause I rejoice in your salvation” (1 Samuel 2:1).\n\nFirst Samuel begins with a beautiful picture of a heart bowed in earnest before the Lord of all creation, asking for what only He can give. And while all the stories in this study will not be quite so tender, they all point to the same reality. The Lord of Hannah—and Samuel, and Saul, and David, and Israel—is the Lord of you and me. He reigns throughout all generations. \n\nI pray our five weeks in 1 & 2 Samuel bring this truth to life for us as we read, ushering us into the knowledge of the truer kingdom and truest King. In Jesus, God has given us the only King who can satisfy our desire for protection, provision, and peace—a King whose throne cannot be defeated.\n\nOur King and His kingdom are forever. Thanks be to God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 3:1-21, 1 Samuel 4:1-22, Psalm 78:58-66, Acts 4:23-31\n\nCalling is rarely simple. I know this from my own life, but I’ve observed it in the lives of others as well. \n\nSeveral years ago, I sat down with women from several different seminaries to ask them why they were going into ministry. These interviews were part of my doctoral research in which I explored the experiences of women and personal calling. For most, their stories were complicated and full of self-doubt. Their calling didn’t necessarily make sense to them. It was a huge risk or a financial sacrifice. As a result, some had resisted the call, while others had rejected it outright. But for nearly all of them, their story of calling was neither simple nor clear.\n\nToo often, we assume calling is straightforward. If it’s really from God, there shouldn’t be any confusion, right? And yet, most biblical stories of calling are complex. Samuel’s is no exception. Three times the Lord called Samuel, and three times Samuel failed to recognize God’s voice. It was the fourth time, and only after receiving wise counsel from Eli, that Samuel finally came to recognize and answer the voice of the Caller (1 Samuel 3:10).\n\nThis is tremendously comforting to all of us who are discerning a call. After all, Samuel heard the literal voice of God, and still he was confused! This tells me that uncertainty, fear, and doubt do not negate the validity of a calling. Instead, they are the norm. In Scripture, nearly every person called by God for a task initially felt afraid, unqualified, or unprepared for the task. Few are the stories of confident leaders who trusted God without pause.\n\nSo, how do we discern God’s calling when it’s unclear? In their  commentary on 1 & 2 Samuel, J.D. Greear and Heath Thomas highlight four key obstacles to discernment: inexperience, expectation, unwillingness, and sin. Samuel was inhibited by the first two; he didn’t know the voice of God, and he wasn’t expecting to hear it. For some of us, it’s our own sin that blinds us; we’re too committed to our own security and comfort.\n\nNo matter the obstacle, Samuel’s story points to one great help in our discernment: wise counsel. Without Eli, Samuel might’ve circled the house twenty times that night, hearing the call but never recognizing it. Thankfully, Eli explained what was happening. Not only did he recognize God’s voice and know His ways, but he also named Samuel’s calling and instructed him on how to respond.\n\nThe women I interviewed reported similar counsel from pastors, parents, mentors and friends—individuals who were able to help them name their gifts, pointed them to Scripture, and encouraged them to boldly trust God. This is a blueprint for us all: it’s always best to discern God’s leading in the context of Christian community.\n\nThe good news is, our God is a pursuer. Over and over again, He called out to Samuel, and He does the same with us. God repeatedly beckons us in big and small ways until we hear and respond to Him. And all the while, He sends us the help of His Church, His Word, and His Spirit as guides. He does all this because no one is more committed to our God-given calling than the One who issues the call.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 5:1-12, 1 Samuel 6:1-21, Exodus 10:1-2, Leviticus 5:14-17\n\nI imagine the cassette tape is the kind of thing that will make my grandchildren’s eyes grow wide. They will giggle at these long gone, barely imaginable pieces of technology that have been replaced by something that is faster, smarter, and better. It will be to them what my own grandparents’ stories of their first radios and 45 records were to me.\n\nI could tell them how my brother and I used to make recordings of our favorite songs when they came on the radio, one of us pressing play on our tape recorder at exactly the right moment while we sat there, silent and completely still, for the entirety of the song. Despite our best efforts, these recordings always seemed to consist of muffled versions of our favorite tunes, featuring the sounds of our breathing and restless fidgeting. \n\nOur most beloved cassette tape not only included the theme from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but also the static of the television we recorded it from. We could never seem to get it right, but at the time, it was worth it for the chance to carry our favorite tunes with us, playing them over and over again.\n\nI can’t read about the Philistines carrying the ark with them without getting that same theme song stuck in my head. Of course, I could now easily pull the song up online to hear the track clearly and without distraction, but I like my crackly, static version just fine.\n\nIf I’m honest, I’m still easily persuaded that I can break God and His glory down into “good enough” pieces of religious comfort—pieces I can carry with me. The Philistines seemed to think this, too. The problem is, we’re not the ones in charge of the carrying.\n\nThe ark, roughly four feet long, was gold-plated and carried on poles that hung through rings on its sides. It was holy, created to house the tablets of the Ten Commandments and serve as a representation of God’s covenant with His people. As we read these passages together, we can all agree that things get pretty weird, right? Dagon, Ashdod’s idol-god, falls onto the ark, and then the city is afflicted with tumors (1 Samuel 5:6). Somewhere along the way, the Philistines began to believe they could move the ark however they pleased, that all of God’s goodness could be contained in a four-foot-long box.\n\nI wonder what kind of boxes we carry with us today. Maybe it’s containing God to a specific place or restricting His character to the confines of our own small experiences. Perhaps the problem is that we’re stuffing the box with selfish pride and hopeful gain but still calling it God’s will.\n\nRegardless, our boxes are all our own cheap versions of the one true Father, muffled by our sin and covered in the static of our humanity. Let us not mistake them for the substance of the Spirit. If we choose to carry anything with us let it be the full arc of the gospel story. Even better, let’s remember that we are the ones who need to be carried.\n\nThat’s what Jesus does for us. He carries us into the very presence of our God, in all His holiness. When the question is asked, “Who is able to stand in the presence of the Lord this holy God?” (1 Samuel 6:20), we can trust that Jesus has made a way for us to do just that. He stood in our place and died the death we deserved so that we could approach our holy God with confidence (Ephesians 3:12).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 7:1-17, 1 Samuel 8:1-22, Proverbs 1:29-33, Hebrews 1:1-3\n\nIn 1 Samuel 8, we find Israel rejecting their God, the One who rescued them from slavery, provided for them in the desert, and gave them victory over their enemies.\n\nIsrael instead demanded a king who would judge them, go before them, and fight their battles (1 Samuel 8:20). Ironically, the King they rejected was the only king to fulfill this request. God had already been their Judge (Deuteronomy 32:36), gone out before them (Exodus 13:21), and fought their battles (Exodus 14:14).\n\nBut they wanted a king “the same as all the other nations” (1 Samuel 8:5). So they rejected their true King, the God of heaven and earth. God granted their request and gave them over to their desires, but not without a warning. He promised to give them a king like all the other nations. He would give them one who was selfish, oppressive, and ruthless. They didn’t heed His warning.\n\nI want to be like everyone else, too. I want to look like everyone else, to be both beautiful and adorable, and so I make my appearance king. Then I find myself overcome by my obsessive eating habits and exercise routine. Turns out that king won’t provide what I need.\n\nI want to have what everyone else has, to feel important and sophisticated, and so I make my possessions king. I spend my time, money, and energy, filling my closet with pretty new dresses. But I’ll never have enough because this king demands more and more and more.\n\nI could go on, and I’m sure you could, too. \n\nOur individual kings demand more from us than we’d ever be willing to give. They lie and tell us that if we could have what the world has, we would have freedom. \n\nSecond Peter 2:19 warns against this:\n\n“They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption, since people are enslaved to whatever defeats them.”\n\nThis is what happens when we, like Israel, fall prey to the desire of being like everyone else. Instead of gaining freedom, we become slaves of corruption. When we turn from the wisdom of the Lord and His ways, we “will eat the fruit of [our] way” (Proverbs 1:29-33). In our efforts to be like the world, we miss out on what we truly need: freedom that can only come from submitting ourselves to the true King, Jesus Christ.\n\nBut God is rich in mercy. He pursues us and draws us to Himself until we long for Him again (1 Samuel 7:2,6). He even works through our rebellion, just as He did with Israel, providing what is truly best for us. God would later appoint David as king over Israel, and through his family, provide the true King in Jesus Christ. He is the One who ultimately goes before us and fights our battles (Revelation 19:11-16). He is all we need, and only in submitting to Him as King will we find freedom instead of slavery (Luke 4:18).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 9:1-27, 1 Samuel 10:1-27, Psalm 2:1-12, Ephesians 1:15-23\n\nHave you ever asked for something you didn’t need? Ten years ago, my husband took a shine to cycling. Bicycling. He hadn’t engaged in the sport before, but he knew how to ride a bike. And since riding a bike is literally a metaphor for something you can never forget, how could I possibly find a flaw in his plan? \n\nAs he researched the sport, he decided he needed vintage cycling jerseys. (I understand his wanting to look like an Italian racecar driver from the ‘40s. It’s a great look.) During these years we were poor school teachers, eating pasta for every meal. Extra purchases hurt us right in the grocery budget, but nevertheless, vintage cycling jerseys were purchased.\n\nWhen these gorgeous, fabled items arrived in the mail, we admired their magisterial purples and heraldic sables. But what came next, gentle reader, is what pains me the very most: he never wore them. It turns out my husband loves neither cycling nor the wearing of spandex-y garments. But since we shelled out so much money for them, we’ve held on to them for three moves. To this day, they remain stashed away in our attic, still in their original packaging. \n\nWe just had to have them. But we didn’t need them!\n\nIsrael asked for something they didn’t need: a king. They started looking around at their neighbors—the Philistines, Moabites, and the Ammonites—for a model of how they wanted to live. They wanted a king like all the other nations, but their misplaced trust in an earthly king was a foolish rejection of God. Israel were His chosen people; He didn’t want them to live like the rest of the world. But they insisted on getting their own way, and He gave them exactly what they asked for.\n\nSaul was a flashy, handsome guy who was physically “impressive” (1 Samuel 9:2), but spiritually dull and cowardly (1 Samuel 10:22). Of course, our inclination in reading this passage is to focus on Saul, just like Israel did. But the impressive and miraculous signs, even his prophesying, ultimately do not point to Saul’s fitness, but God’s.\n\nWhen those wicked men asked, “How can this guy save us?” they were doubling down on their doubt of God’s provision (1 Samuel 10:27). They wanted a king, so God gave them Saul—a man literally head and shoulders above all the rest in Israel—to rule over them. When he shows up, they still doubt. Ironically, this doubting of God’s provision would later be Saul’s undoing as well.\n\nWherever the Spirit of the Lord is at work, we ought never doubt of God’s provision. But if God’s Spirit does not lead the way, we ought not go forth. The real importance of this passage is simply this: God works His mercies by His Spirit, even amongst a rebellious people.\n\nThis theme should be familiar, because the real story of God’s Anointed One is not about Saul. Saul’s kingship was an ironic foreshadowing of the true Anointed One, Christ. May our hearts seek first His kingdom. May we look to Him to provide us with what we truly need, rather than trying to build a kingdom of our own making.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kim Cash Tate\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 11:1-15, 1 Samuel 12:1-25, Isaiah 5:8-12, Micah 6:1-5\n\nI still vividly recall my third year of law school, when graduation neared and I had no offer of employment. The plan had been to work at a Washington, D.C., law firm during the second summer and, by the end of my time there, secure a permanent offer to return upon graduation. But the firm suffered a financial downturn and could extend only two offers. (Another firm I’d turned down extended more than twenty.) Stressed out and covered in hives, I was sure I’d be forever unemployed.\n\nPlease, let me get this position. My heart uttered those words with every resume sent, every interview secured. Still, the rejections piled up. Then, one week before graduation, my resume found its way to the desk of a federal judge in Madison, Wisconsin. She conducted a phone interview, flew me out for a face-to-face, and offered a clerkship on the spot. It was one of the best jobs I could’ve gotten. And oh, how I celebrated, calling it as a blessing. \n\nA month later, my fiancé and I ventured to Madison to begin our careers. We rented an apartment and moved in together. I didn’t know the Lord at the time. I wanted His blessings, but I didn’t want Him as Lord and King over my life.\n\nSuch was the state of affairs in Israel during the latter part of Samuel’s time as judge. The people asked for a king to reign over them “like all the nations” (1 Samuel 8:5), thus rejecting God as King. They got what they asked for. God chose Saul to be their king, and, empowered by His Spirit, Saul led the people to a great victory against the Ammonites. And oh, how they celebrated. They had their king! They had victory over the enemy!\n\nWith such immense blessings, they surely felt all was well. Don’t we tend to think the same?  When we’re being blessed—especially if we’ve received the very thing we asked for—we don’t see “warning” flags. To the contrary, we feel good about ourselves and our situation, perhaps even about our relationship with God. After all, we must be doing something right in order for God to bless us, right?\n\nBut blessings have more to do with God than with us. They reflect His amazing grace and His long-suffering character. They flow from His lovingkindness and goodness. “For He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous” (Matthew 5:45). \n\nIn the midst of great blessing, our hearts can still be far from God. And apart from Him, blessings are merely temporal and empty.\n\nGod was gracious in pointing this out to the people of Israel. Through the prophet Samuel, He interrupted their revelry to remind them that they had rejected Him and to point to where true prosperity lay. \n\n“If you fear the Lord, worship and obey him, and if you don’t rebel against the Lord’s command, then both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the Lord your God.”\n– 1 Samuel 12:14\n\nMadison ended up being the place where I met the Lord, where He drew me to Himself and saved me. That was the true blessing—the greatest blessing. Now, when I think of that time, I’m reminded that no matter what is happening outwardly in our lives, whether hardships or joy, the true measure of our well-being is in the posture of our hearts before God. The ultimate blessing is in following Him and allowing Him to reign as King over our lives.\n\n",

Mostly I doubted my ability to do the job well—and our kids were only in first grade and pre-K. But despite my initial doubts, those early years turned out to be fruitful in numerous ways, not only for them, but for our family as a whole. \n\nStill, imagine my angst when high school neared. Yes, God had been faithful, but this was the big leagues now. The stakes were higher, and my own inadequacies might hamper their options for the future. Yet, as I write, our youngest has graduated from our homeschool and will be joining her brother at a wonderful university. Once again, God showed Himself faithful throughout the high school journey.\n\nMy propensity to stick with safety and comfort has reached well beyond homeschooling. Whenever I’ve sensed God’s call to embrace a new challenge, I’m never short on reasons why it won’t work. Or why I can’t do it. Or why I might be hearing God wrong altogether. In truth, I can identify with the King Saul we see in 1 Samuel 13 and 14.\n\nThough Saul had been given the Spirit of God, and had once called men valiantly to battle, his courage was diminished. The Philistines were an ever-present threat, occupying territory in Israel, and Saul seemed content to lay low. Perhaps if the Israelites didn’t kick up any dust and cause trouble, the Philistines would leave them be. Despite the power God had made available to him, Saul took to playing it safe.\n\nIn stark contrast, his son Jonathan embraced the challenge. Though the Philistines were superior in number and in weaponry, Jonathan went after them with just one other man. He said, “Come on, let’s cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps the Lord will help us. Nothing can keep the Lord from saving, whether by many or by few” (1 Samuel 14:6).\n\nWho puts themselves in a position to see God fight for them? Whose trust is that deep? God rewarded Jonathan’s faith, causing several Philistine men to fall and sending an earthquake that caused trembling in the camp.\n\nWhat stops us from trusting like that? As believers in Christ, we are indwelled by the Spirit of God, His infinite power and might. We are armed with the promises of God, among them being His promise to be with us, His promise to establish His purposes in our lives, and His promise to be faithful, always. We are assured that we have nothing to fear—and indeed, no matter what we may endure, it can’t compare to the “eternal weight of glory” to come (2 Corinthians 4:17).\n\nBiblical accounts such as Jonathan’s serve to stir up our faith and courage in Christ. Like Jonathan, we can believe God. We can embrace the challenges to which we are called. And we can witness God’s powerful hand at work.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 15:1-35, 1 Samuel 16:1-23, Ruth 4:18-22, Luke 6:45\n\nAbout the time my future groom and I started looking at rings, a story circulated through my college dorm that put many of us hopeful brides-to-be on high alert. Whether true or simply an urban legend, I can’t say. But long after my now-husband popped the question, the story has stuck with me. It goes like this…\n\nA handsome young man decided to propose to a beautiful girl. He told her that since they were poor college kids, he could not afford much of a ring. He proposed with a small cubic zirconia, a manufactured replacement for a real diamond. But secretly, he purchased a beautiful, expensive, whopper of a diamond and planned to have it put in the setting for their wedding day. But when the blushing bride-to-be discovered her ring was a fake, she demanded the real thing. The groom was so turned off by her shallow behavior that he broke off the engagement. Only then did the girl learn that he’d planned all along to take her breath away with a real diamond.\n\nIn 1 Samuel, we find a similar tale of fake worth and diamonds in the rough. Saul had been anointed as the first king of Israel. He seemed to have it all, but it didn’t take long for his façade to crack. Saul was deeply flawed. His dependence on the Lord turned out to be counterfeit, and in 1 Samuel 15, the Lord rejected Saul as king of Israel.\n\nIsrael’s prophet, Samuel, was grieved by Saul’s failings. I imagine he might have felt like that bride-to-be, who thought her boyfriend had bought her a diamond only to discover she’d been given a chunk of glass. But God was like the groom with something better tucked away. Despite Israel’s long history of doubting God, He planned to replace Saul with a king so good he’d become the measuring stick for all other kings to come.\n\nAt the Lord’s prompting, Samuel went to the house of Jesse looking for a new king. Jesse had  eight sons and he paraded all but the youngest in front of Samuel. Each time, the Lord said “no.” Samuel was baffled by God’s rejection of such strong, capable men. God’s explanation put a magnifying glass over Samuel’s heart.\n\n“But the Lᴏʀᴅ said to Samuel, ‘Do not look at his appearance or his stature, because I have rejected him. Humans do not see what the Lᴏʀᴅ sees, for humans see what is visible, but the Lᴏʀᴅ sees the heart.’”\n– 1 Samuel 16:7\n\nDavid didn’t look like a king. His father thought so little of him that he didn’t even bring him in from the field. But God chose him. Beneath an unimpressive exterior, God saw treasures in David’s heart. \n\nWe can’t polish ourselves pretty enough to create our own worth. But God mines for value in each of our hearts.\n\n",

Thinking back over the years, I can remember a lot of mistakes I’ve made, not to mention the mistakes I made today. Seriously, I don’t seem to be able to make it though one day without putting my foot in my mouth just a little bit.\n\nBut I have learned so much, and there is one simple thing for which I am most grateful: I have learned about the Bible. The more I read, the more I’m able to make connections and see the echoes of one passage in another. More than the research and the commentaries, the focused act of reading my Bible has given me confident hope for the future.\n\nI have learned that my own resolutions to achieve and do better will absolutely come to nothing. I know that all good things come by the power of God’s grace, not the resolve of my earnest soul. I’ve learned that fear and worry serve no purpose in God’s economy. And another great perk of knowing your Bible is knowing what God has promised.\n\nThis is exactly where David was when he heard that Goliath the Philistine was threatening the troops of Israel. He was just totally outraged that no one had taken up the challenge because he knew that God had already promised to preserve and protect Israel. Not only that, but God had already delivered the giants into Israel’s hands before: when Abraham conquered Chedorlaomer (Genesis 14), and when Israel entered the land of promise (Numbers 13:17-33). \n\nDavid knew God’s covenant promises to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. He’d heard the stories of God’s amazing protection over Noah and his family. And he’d read the heroic tales of Joshua’s obedience to God. He knew, most of all, that God is faithful, and that He cannot be mocked (Galatians 6:7).\n\nDavid knew his Bible. He knew God’s promises. So when he was confronted with a threatening Philistine giant, he said, “ Today, the LORD will hand you over to me” (1 Samuel 17:46). Those sound like brave words if you don’t know the end of the story. But the pattern of redemption is always the same: the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain… but the Lord is enthroned in heaven (Psalm 2). The Bible tells us we will always have troubles, but Jesus is the hero and He always slays the dragon in the end.\n\nKnow His Word. Know who God is. Remember the history of His providence. Lay hold of His unfailing promises. David wasn’t doing anything new, but he was a man who knew his Bible.\n\nI don’t know that I’m ready to face any giants, but knowing God’s Word and His promises were exactly the foundation for David’s confidence before Goliath. It wasn’t his sling and stones, or his history of bear-fighting. It was simply God’s Word.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 18:1-30, 1 Samuel 19:1-24, Psalm 59:1-17\n\nIt all started with pride and a hankering for toast.\n\nWith a freshly ironed shirt and crisp college degree, I walked through the doors of my new job and stepped into a schedule full of meetings and a to-do list of fires to put out. Literally.\n\nSoon after becoming acquainted with the office kitchen and its various coffee creamers and water bottles, I found myself staring into a tiny toaster smelling very burnt toast. The piece of bread was mine, of course, but its transformation into unrecognizable burnt crumbles made me feel as if I had no business being near baked goods of any kind, ever. I looked around the empty room, wondering when the toast’s lunatic owner, ahem, would rescue it from the smoke-producing heat.\n\nI regularly find myself feeling neglectful like this in the kitchen, but I can also be careless with my thought life too. Envy starts a fire in my heart, causing my feelings to combust from the inside out. From seemingly nowhere, jealousy rears its ugly head, just in time for me to realize these terrible thoughts are unfortunately, actually mine (all mine!)—unlike my friend’s new engagement ring, vacation plans, promotion, or instagram attention, which caused my emotions to boil over in the first place. I truly want to celebrate these things for my friend (I do!), but turning away from my good intentions for even five seconds leaves these feelings to roast unattended over an open flame.\n\nEnvy might be the only sin that never feels good, not even for a moment. Other sins give us fleeting pleasure or empty promises, but envy hands us a box of matches and permission to light the fire. And before we know it, we’re in a room full of smoke.\n\nIn 1 Samuel 18, there’s a friendly celebration happening, the kind we intend to give the people we love as a way to congratulate them. Saul is great! David is great! We all have tambourines! But envy creeps into Saul’s heart when he hears, “Saul has killed his thousands, but David his tens of thousands” (v.7, emphasis mine).\n\nThe matches are lit, and Saul is off to kill David. That escalated quickly, didn’t it? I’m not sure Saul even knows how he got there, but then I remember my own failed attempts to rescue bread from the kitchen toaster. (I grabbed a paper towel to smother the flames, which of course, actually made them worse.) So, I can understand why Saul would want to get rid of any evidence pointing directly to his failures. \n\nI’ll bet Saul had one word ringing in his head that may sound familiar to you and me: mine. He wanted to claim it all as his—the glory, the credit, the recognition, the love. (Can anyone else relate?)\n\nAlthough David seemed to have it all together, he only had one quality worth envying: the presence of the One who actually does hold it all together. In these two chapters, we see the phrase “God with David” four times. This is what sets David apart. This is what Saul wants. This is what we all want. Our cries may say “Mine!,” but all we ever really want is for Someone to choose us, to adopt us as their own.\n\nThe glory, the credit, the recognition, the love—they’re all the Lord’s. And friends, so are we. He smothers the flames of envy by showing us we already belong. After all, it all started with love and a hankering for home.\n\n“You are my strength, I sing praise to you;\n you, God, are my fortress,\nmy God on whom I can rely.”\n– Psalm 59:17\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kim Thomas\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 20:1-42, 1 Samuel 21:1-15, 1 Samuel 22:1-23, Psalm 34:1-3, Matthew 10:34-39\n\nI don’t know if it’s because I’m the daughter of a Navy Captain, or because my heart beats to the rhythm of the tides, but I feel most settled at the ocean. Recently, on an early morning walk, I remembered a line from a poem I wrote in sixth grade: “the waves jump up and hit my face / in and out, like fancy lace…” Relentless and submissive, joyful and with full abandon, the waves come and serve themselves to the shore. They do not pause several hundred feet out to decide whether or not they should move forward.\n\nIf only making decisions came so easily for me.\n\nGranted, it’s their ontological design, so there’s that. But I still long for a simple, clear confidence of direction when making difficult decisions—especially relational ones that cause me to choose one loyalty over another. Or when things are simply inconvenient and I know the consequences will be costly. I confess I find it easier to hover out from the shore rather than risk crashing on the wrong one.\n\nI admire the clarity of mind Jonathan displays in 1 Samuel. Early on, he’s presented with a tangled, messy, relational situation, yet Jonathan honors his commitment to David without hesitation, promising, “Whatever you say, I will do for you” (1 Samuel 20:4). Boom. I can almost hear the splash and feel the spray on my face.\n\nIn that split second, Jonathan has committed to protect his friend David from his own father, King Saul. In doing so, he helps to preserve a kingship, which ultimately results in the Messiah’s arrival and our own salvation rescue. Jonathan couldn’t have known the long-range significance in the moment, or what the ultimate cost of such a commitment would be (1 Samuel 31). But he did know the next right thing to do, and he did it with moral clarity and a clear conscience.\n\nMy decisions aren’t usually life-and-death, and the accompanying narrative is not nearly as dramatic. But when it comes to decision-making in my own life,  I’ve experienced the tension between relational loyalties and moral clarity in more ways than I can count.\n\nTake the other night—a somewhat trivial, but practical example. We were sitting in our courtyard, as our neighbor’s two small dogs continued to bark… at 11 o’clock… pm.\n\nIt’s not a new issue for us; there have been conversations, requests, and reminders. We could’ve very easily called the police to come issue a citation. It would even be morally appropriate to do so. But I happen to know our neighbor is an older, divorced woman who lives alone, and those two dogs are her family. I also know she would nearly die if the police showed up at her door. So after hesitating for about 20 minutes, I texted her a kind but firm request that she bring her dogs inside since it was so late. She did, and the next day she sent me a heartfelt text of apology.\n\nLong-range significance? I’m not sure, except that she knows we pastor a church and pray for her regularly. But I do know it’s better to extend grace and compassion—overlooking my own temporary inconvenience—rather than risk whatever potential kingdom fruit may come from our relationship.\n\nMany decisions cost far more than this small disturbance in our neighborhood. But even in the small things, God is teaching me about His presence in all things. When my choices are guided by what will bring glory to God and grow fruit for His kingdom, the decisions come more easily, and with quicker clarity. As Jesus Himself tells His disciples in the last part of Matthew 10:39, whenever we lose our life for His sake, we will find it in Him.\n\nPerhaps there is a rhythm to be found here yet—like the waves.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 23:1-29, 1 Samuel 24:1-22, Psalm 54:1-7, John 19:10-11\n\nWhen righteous young David has the chance to take out paranoid, egotistical, narcissistic Saul twice and doesn’t do it, part of me wants to throw my hands up in frustration. That’s not how the story should go! The hero is supposed to seize his opportunity to conquer his enemy, then ride off into the sunset as the credits roll.\n\nInstead, David’s anti-climactic showdown with Saul reminds us who the real Hero is. In 1 Samuel 24, David and a small army of followers are on the run. Saul and an army of 3,000 soldiers are hunting David with the goal to kill him.  \n\nIn an ironic, almost comical twist, the paranoid king decides to relieve himself in the very cave where David and his men were hiding. If I’d been in David’s squad, I would’ve joined their rallying cry.\n\n“Look, this is the day the Lᴏʀᴅ told you about: ‘I will hand your enemy over to you so you can do to him whatever you desire’” (1 Samuel 24:4).\n\nTake your shot! He’s got it coming! Eliminate the threat! Instead, David sneaks up behind his archenemy and cuts off the corner of his robe.\n\nWait. What?\n\nDavid had already been anointed king, and clearly, Saul was no good for God’s people—his thirst for David’s blood was insatiable. So why then, does David opt to take a piece of Saul’s robe, as opposed to a piece of the man himself?\n\nHow could David be so bridled in the face of an enemy so bent on his destruction? It wasn’t that David didn’t crave relief from his enemy. He hadn’t assumed a position of defeat. He knew the battle ultimately belonged to the Lord.\n\nAt the mouth of the cave, David said these words to Saul:\n\n“May the Lᴏʀᴅ judge between me and you, and may the Lᴏʀᴅ take vengeance on you for me, but my hand will never be against you” (1 Samuel 24:12).\n\nWe don’t have to seek revenge or take out our enemies. David’s defender is our defender. When we find ourselves face to face with a threat, our Father’s advice is to respond with kindness and let Him do what He will (Proverbs 25:21-22). \n\nDavid’s restraint helps us grasp the big picture. If we widen the lens, we can see that the Lord has disarmed our ultimate enemy. God alone is the ultimate Authority and Judge in this world and the world to come (John 19:10-11). \n\nSo we don’t have to head into every fight with fists clenched. We don’t have to be the judge and jury in our search for justice. David’s defender is fighting for us. He is our helper, the sustainer of our lives, and our rescuer in every situation (Psalm 54:4,7). The battle belongs to the Lord!\n\n",

So I’m in dangerous territory from the start when it comes to her. And this year at school she shared a class with the prettiest, pinkest little bully I’ve ever seen. Every time a report came home of another petty injustice, I wanted to rise up and bring my considerable adult authority to the situation. My heart longs to exact vengeance on my own terms. And while there is certainly a place to stand up for what is right, vengeance enacted by me shouting at little girls just can’t be the answer.\n\nWe are inclined to take matters into our own hands, to avenge ourselves on others. In David’s case, it seems like David had every right to avenge himself. Nabal was a total fool (I mean, his name literally means “fool”) who had actually profited by the protection of David’s men, but who thanklessly despised his own protector. Not only this, but then his contempt for David and his men was expressed by uncontrollably raging at them. Sure of his own self-worth, greedy of his own possessions, he failed to acknowledge God’s gracious provision in David, his protector.\n\nWho could blame David for wanting to take vengeance? He was, after all, the Lord’s anointed. Surely he deserved at least civil treatment from Nabal. He had the manpower with him to attack and destroy Nabal and his family for the slight. But regardless of whether others deserve vengeance, it is not ours to mete out. Remember this uncomfortable, yet comforting verse: “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord” (Romans 12:19)?\n\nGod prevented David from sin through Abigail’s humility and discernment. She knew better than David her own husband’s perpetual folly, yet sought not her own ends, nor vengeance, nor the interests of any one person. Rather, she humbly defended a fool, courageously confronted a vengeful warrior, in order to keep all from evil. “May evil not be found in you,” she said to David (1 Samuel 25:28). Abigail’s words echo the righteous desire of God’s own heart, that His people walk in righteousness, seeking His glory above their own, and trusting all manners to His care.\n\nWhen David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the LORD who championed my cause against Nabal’s insults and restrained his servant from doing evil. The LORD brought Nabal’s evil deeds back on his own head” (1 Samuel 25:39).\n\nDavid was stopped that day from a folly equal to Nabal’s: that of assuming that our own good is in our own hands. But ultimately, David understood that only God is his defender (1 Samuel 26:10-11; 2 Samuel 1:14-15; 4:12).\n\nBlessed be the Lord! He alone is our sure defense, not only against the offenses made against us, but also from the folly from within our own hearts. Rest in His provision.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 28:1-25, 1 Samuel 29:1-11, Deuteronomy 18:10-12, Proverbs 1:28\n\nOne frigid winter evening when my husband was still in grad school, I tried to call him. He had been out with friends after finishing finals, while I was already home for Christmas, several states away. When he didn’t answer his phone around 9pm, I wasn’t too worried. I called again an hour or so later, just before I went to bed, and he still didn’t answer. Then I sent off a few texts, each more worried than the last, hoping he would respond. \n\nI darted in and out of sleep, checking my phone, calling, and texting, until about 4am, when he finally texted me back to say he had fallen asleep well before 9:00—the hard, deep sleep of a post-finals student who had forgotten to charge his mobile phone, rendering it useless. And while we were quickly able to laugh about it, I can still feel my heart racing when I think about how I felt that night, several states away, not able to get in touch with him for hours. I would’ve done anything for an answer, for the assurance that he was okay.\n\nSaul is in a frantic panic in 1 Samuel 28. He knows the Philistines are ready to fight at Mount Gilboa. He knows God has rejected him as king (1 Samuel 15:23). He knows Samuel is dead—Samuel, who had been with him since his anointing, who’d walked with him and guided him in the ways of the Lord. Desperate for answers, Saul has sought the Lord about how he should face the Philistines. But the Lord is silent because He’s rejected Saul, leaving him to feel very, very alone.\n\nAnd so Saul, the warrior king who’d chosen his own pride over the Lord so many times before, again seeks his own comfort and control first. He consults a medium—after declaring all mediums illegal and sending them out of Israel—for the answer he so desperately needs. He asks her to bring forth Samuel, who appears and tells Saul that he and his sons will die in the next day’s battle. \n\nI can hardly breathe if I put myself in Saul’s shoes. The desperation he must’ve felt before visiting the medium would have been silenced by that cold truth. He would lose the battle. He would no longer be king, nor would his sons inherit the throne. The years of turning away from the Lord and seeking his own glory had left him there, alone. \n\nWhen I think about how often I obsess over the future—running worst-case scenarios through my head, working myself into a panic—I realize that I’m tempted in the same ways Saul was. It’s so much easier to take matters into my own hands, to live for my own glory, and to forget about the Lord’s steadfast faithfulness. Perhaps if Saul had reflected on how faithful the Lord had been to the people of Israel, he would’ve trusted the Lord for one more day. \n\nSo the cup I have to drink today is the cup of the Lord’s faithfulness. It is to choose trust and faith over fear and control. It is to recite to myself the promise Moses made to Joshua in Deuteronomy 31:8:\n\n“The Lord is the one who will go before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or abandon you. Do not be afraid or discouraged.”\n\nThe Lord goes before me. He knows and numbers my days. And I have confidence through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus that God always keeps His promises. I may not face Philistines in battle, but I will face temptation, fear, and death as surely as Saul did. And so I pray that an unshakable confidence in Christ will be my only and blessed assurance each day.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 30:1-31, 1 Samuel 31:1-13, Psalm 56:3-4, Luke 4:18-19\n\nYesterday we read about Saul’s moment of desperation. He knew he was facing a mighty battle against the Philistines, and he knew he was facing them alone. He was without Samuel, and he was without the Lord, who had turned away from him after his repeated disobedience. And Saul, who must have been near-crazed with fear, broke his own laws and the law of God by consulting a medium to try to find an answer. \n\nToday, we read about David in a similar situation. The Amalekites had raided the city of Ziklag, burned it, and captured all of the women and children. David and his army returned to Ziklag, but there was nothing left. In fact, they “wept loudly until they had no strength left to weep” (1 Samuel 30:4). That sentence strikes the deepest fear into my own heart, which is rather predisposed to fear and anxiety. I can’t imagine that kind of pain. \n\nAnd yet David responds with faith. Even though his wives have been captured, his city burned, and his army is threatening to rise up against him to stone him to death—David responds with faith. David is facing a loneliness and uncertainty perhaps even greater than Saul’s before the battle at Mount Gilboa. David has let his people down, the very people God has entrusted him to lead. But 1 Samuel 30:6 tells us, “David found strength in the Lord his God.” \n\nI am humbled by David in this passage. I am convicted by Saul’s impatience and need to control, but I am humbled and inspired by David’s faith and his generosity. His response to trial was to trust the Lord. And his response to great victory was to praise the Lord and share the spoils. David, who knew he would be king, claimed no victory outside of the Lord’s faithfulness. \n\nEven when I do choose the way of David—fragile yet desperately leaning on the Lord because I know only He can sustain me—I often forget His faithfulness when my moment of trial has passed. It is only when I intentionally take time to reflect on the Lord’s guiding, preserving hand that I remember to give thanks and to testify to His goodness. \n\nMy prayer today is not only to carry with me the confidence of faith, but to remember to testify to the Lord’s great faithfulness in my life. I can testify to His glory through my worship, His presence through my prayers, and His mercy through my actions toward others. I can testify to His grace in my quickness to forgive and His provision when I am generous. \n\nDavid’s actions remind me to not only rely on the Lord daily, but to also tell of His great deeds. When I live with gratitude in response to Christ’s love for me, I testify to the gift of His sacrifice on the cross and the unimaginable mercy of the gospel.\n\n",

Norma, an aging Hollywood starlet, longs for a comeback. She’s deluded enough to think that by sheer force of will, she can break back into the business with a new movie. It goes horribly wrong for her, and the movie ends as she descends a staircase, guilty of murder, smiling and waving to the flashes of reporters’ cameras as she’s taken into police custody. Norma couldn’t loosen her vulture-grip on her own fame to see reality.\n\nNow, I’m not usually a wide-eyed crazy lady clawing at the scraps of my imagined life—or am I? Do I try to hold onto things that are gone and out of my control? Do I secretly attempt to force God to do my bidding? I suspect that because of our sin nature, we all try to control our own circumstances, instead of trusting God to go to bat for us.\n\nThe aging starlet reminds me of King Saul. While Saul was still in power, Samuel anointed David as God’s choice for king (1 Samuel 16:1). Instead of gracefully stepping down, Saul raged on, fighting for years against both David and the will of God.\n\nLook at the story from David’s perspective. He was the youngest and the least impressive of all his brothers. Although Samuel did have a small family ceremony after he anointed him, not much changed right away for David. He was still the little brother who had to tend the sheep. \n\nBut one very significant thing did change immediately: the Spirit of the Lord came upon David and departed from Saul, who was then plagued by an evil spirit (1 Samuel 16:14). Although David didn’t actually assume the throne for years after he was anointed, the Spirit of the Lord was with him. That was more valuable than 10,000 thrones. While Saul scraped and grasped to keep control of his kingdom, David waited on God’s timing and spent the years learning to listen to the Lord.\n\nDespite the Lord’s clear choice of David as king over Israel, Saul was unwilling to give up the kingdom. He knew David would be king, but he was unable to let go of his delusion of power before his death. \n\nDavid didn’t have to scramble and fight for the crown. The Lord chose him; He gave David the throne (2 Samuel 2). David didn’t have to take matters into his own hands. God had everything under control, and He still does. His faithfulness frees us to be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, and faithful in prayer. Like David, we are free to bless, and not curse, those who would seek to harm us (Romans 12:12,14). \n\nWe don’t have to claw, hustle, and scratch to make things happen in our lives. God is still sovereign. In spite of all Saul’s labors, his day was over as David’s was ready to begin. David waited patiently for the Lord, and we can, too, with confidence. God will defend and protect us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kim Thomas\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 3:1-39, 2 Samuel 4:1-12, Psalm 30:11-12, Jeremiah 16:5-9\n\nFor me, when studying Old Testament books like 1 and 2 Samuel, it’s best to do so with an understanding of context, time, and culture. Although the vitriol on display in the public square today—where we’ve lost the art of respectful discussion and disagreement—is not much more pleasant, the violence and carnage of the civil war stories found in 2 Samuel are indeed gruesome.\n\nWe begin with the end in mind: “During the long war between the house of Saul and the house of David, David was growing stronger and the house of Saul was becoming weaker” (2 Samuel 3:1). From there, the writer unfolds the machinations and details of kingdom intrigue for us. There are birth announcements, power moves, peace agreements made and broken, deceptions, murders, people wanting the right thing but going about it the wrong way. And in the middle of the bloodthirsty ambition surrounding him, David is becoming a leader.\n\nWhile he is not without shame, we do get to witness David’s growth as a man and king. Rather than the foolish mischief of those who would woo him towards calculated misdeeds to secure the throne, David is engaged with the ways of honor and justice, poetic lament and respect. These are things that honor his God and serve to build loyalty in his people: the right things, for the right reasons.\n\nAnd have you noticed David’s patience and trust in God’s promise? God spoke to Samuel, instructing that the young boy David was His choice, the one to be anointed (1 Samuel 16). But now, many years later, he is a grown man and still waiting. He waited through Saul’s manic ranting and reign, spending one minute in Saul’s good graces, and the next dodging Saul’s attempts to kill him.\n\nAt one opportune moment, when David could have ended Saul’s dangerous obsession with him, he submissively clips his garment rather than taking his life. Rather than seizing the opportunity to impose his own moment, he learns the patience that comes from belonging to a faithfully sovereign, promise-keeping God. David knew he was God’s anointed one, and he rested in that promise.\n\nNot once does he whine or complain. He doesn’t rehearse a martyr’s refrain or an entitled person’s manifesto. (I’d actually give him room to do any of those.) David has found an intimate place before the Lord where his soul rests and sings. Even in the midst of carnage and betrayal, David rests in knowing he was God’s anointed.\n\nThat’s my big takeaway from these verses, and it’s a big one. Though, I’m contextually without a monarchy and not bearing up under such gruesome circumstances as David’s. I’m just managing today and my own expectations—expectations of myself, people I love, opportunities I think should be mine (maybe a bit like Abner), and to be honest, my expectations of God. I’m afraid I’ve whined and complained out of a sense of entitlement. But I so want to live gracefully, daily trusting in the sovereignty of God’s faithfulness.\n\nThankfully, God’s promise-keeping did not end with David’s throne. The promised Messiah and Redeemer of the Davidic line has come (2 Samuel 3:18). When unrest shakes our souls, we can take refuge in our relationship with our Promise Keeper God. Abiding in His presence strengthens us so we can wait on Him, His perfect will, and His perfect timing.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 5:1-25, 2 Samuel 6:1-23, 2 Samuel 7:1-29, 1 Corinthians 12:12-20, Hebrews 10:19-22\n\nI’ve always assumed that a covenant is an if/then agreement. If you do x, then I’ll do y. If you fail to do x, then I’m entitled to y. Since dissecting legal mumbo-jumbo isn’t really my thing, the idea of a covenant always felt a little sterile to me. \n\nMaybe that’s why I typically paid little attention to the Old Testament covenants. God’s covenant promises are mentioned in many places, so I did plenty of glossing over them. The biggies include the Noahic Covenant found in Genesis 9, the Abrahamic Covenant in Genesis 12, and the Mosaic Covenant in Exodus 19. \n\nBecause I only skimmed these passages, I thought the covenants were cut-and-dried versions of this: If God’s people obey the law, they get blessed; if they fail to obey the law, they get cursed. Certainly, there are blessings that come with obedience, and consequences that come with rebellion—but that isn’t the bottom line. It’s not how God does business. \n\nGod’s covenants are not equal partnerships. God gives infinitely more than He ever plans to receive.\n\nWe see this clearly in God’s covenant with David (2 Samuel 7). God had been blessing David since childhood, but here, He makes it official. God promises David these things: fame and prestige, deep roots, safety and security, legacy, and a bright future. \n\nGod promised big! This is the “then” portion of God’s covenant with David. But what was the “if”? What did David have to do to earn these lavish gifts? Well, for starters he had to….\n\n(Crickets.)\n\nNothing. There is no “if” to qualify God’s “then.” David doesn’t have do his part for this covenant agreement to stand. God promises David that His “faithful love will never leave him” (v.15). He gives generously out of His extravagant love, not legal obligation. And David’s response is awestruck worship.\n\n“This is why you are great, Lord God. There is no one like you, and there is no God besides you, as all we have heard confirms.”\n– 2 Samuel 7:22\n\nDavid enjoyed what I missed when I zoomed past the previous covenants: God doesn’t love us out of obligation. There is no way for the scales to be equal when man enters into a covenant with the God who created him. \n\nThe covenants of the Old Testament are like neon signs pointing to something bigger and better. They set the table for the fulfillment of God’s covenant of grace, perfected in the finished work of Christ on our behalf. \n\n“In the same way he also took the cup after the supper and said, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood; it is shed for you.”\n– Luke 22:20\n\nThe covenant Jesus offers us is this: we bring our nothing, and He gives us everything. The scales are forever tipped in our favor. May we learn to stop glossing over the goodness of our God. Instead, let us respond in worship to the God who gives extravagantly.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 8:1-18, 2 Samuel 9:1-13, 2 Samuel 10:1-19, Acts 4:24-28\n\nWhen I was 20 years old, I spent a semester by myself in Chile. I was an intern there—not part of a full study abroad program with tons of other college students. I lived with a host family and worked with other Americans, but there was no one else there in the same position. I found myself pretty much alone. \n\nOne day, my Spanish teacher invited me to an “asado” at her house. A Chilean asado is a backyard barbecue on steroids: hours and hours of food, drink, laughter, stories, and family. It’s a feast for the stomach and the heart. I didn’t have much going on during the weekends, so I went. I’ll never forget the feeling of overwhelming acceptance washing over me that day. I felt known and welcomed there. For one afternoon, I was completely enveloped into their family.\n\nI’ve never been in David’s shoes—a newly-crowned king looking to gain and maintain power. But I have been in Mephibosheth’s, feeling like the lonely outcast. Mephibosheth was the crippled grandson of the fallen king; all tradition and expectation would have been for David to ignore him at best, and kill him at worst. \n\nBut the victorious and powerful King David, remembering his promise to Jonathan and Saul, instead seeks Mephibosheth out and honors him. He restores the family land to Mephibosheth, and invites him to feast at his table. Even Mephibosheth can’t believe it. “What is your servant that you take an interest in a dead dog like me?” (2 Samuel 9:8).\n\nDavid’s kindness is not spur of the moment, either. He seeks out Mephibosheth to offer him “hesed,” the Hebrew word for lovingkindness. This word is found all over the Old Testament, used to describe God’s steadfast love and faithfulness to His people. In Exodus 34, God Himself uses hesed to describe His own character: “The Lord passed in front of him and proclaimed: The Lord—the Lord is a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love and truth” (v.6).\n\nWhat we see David give to Mephibosheth is the same lovingkindness that God offers us through His Son. David invited Mephibosheth to be “like one of the king’s sons.” \n\nIt’s impossible to read this story and not see myself—crippled in spirit, with nothing to give, and yet completely welcomed into Christ’s family because of God’s lovingkindness to me. I am Mephibosheth, Joseph’s brothers, Job, and the prodigal son all rolled into one. And God seeks me out, the way David seeks out Mephibosheth. \n\nJesus invites us to a feast far greater than King David’s, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink” (John 7:37). May we answer His invitation with thankful hearts, filled with the unsurpassed joy that comes from knowing our Father loves us with perfect, steadfast love.  \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessie Minassian\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 11:1-27, 2 Samuel 12:1-25, Psalm 51:1-19, Isaiah 42:1-4\n\nThe sins that tend to shock us most are the ones committed by those who know better. \n\nWhen we’ve walked with God a long time, learned from Him, depended on Him through dark valleys—when we’ve tasted and seen that the Lord is indeed good—and then choose sin instead, our fall feels twice as far and three times as hard.\n\nIf anyone were immune to moral failure, you’d think it would be the boy-turned-king who watched a giant fall at his feet. The one whom God miraculously spared from death and handed a kingdom. The one who wrote dozens of songs about his devotion to God, and God’s devotion to him. The one whom God specifically chose for his loyalty and obedience (1 Samuel 13:14; Psalm 89:20). But even great faith doesn’t inoculate us against temptation. \n\nWhen it comes to sin, we’re never more than a couple bad choices away from our worst moment. Humility must rule our hearts. Boundaries must guard our choices.\n\nDavid’s sin, much like many of ours, began as a slow slide. “In the Spring when kings march out to war,” David was home instead (2 Samuel 11:1). Apparently he felt his kingdom was secure enough that his right-hand military man, Joab, could take care of business on his own. Maybe he suffered from vocational boredom or spiritual apathy. Maybe he had a mid-life crisis, or he was just feeling lazy and lax. That’s when temptation came. Then justification. Then trespass.\n\nDavid’s sin left a wake of consequences that affected not only him, but Uriah, Bathsheba, an innocent baby boy, and an entire nation. But even with all that collateral damage, the real weight of David’s story wasn’t in his failure but in his restoration. God confronted, then offered forgiveness to, the man who undeniably “knew better.” \n\nThe implications are too beautiful to ignore: we may have to face natural or divine consequences for our sin, but God never refuses to forgive. \n\nBut there’s even more good news woven through this story. One sin—even a whole season of bad choices—doesn’t have to define our lives. Yes, David sinned. He sinned big. But long after David’s body turned to dust, God still measured other kings’ successes or failures by David’s heart (1 Kings 14:7-8; 2 Kings 14:3, 16:2), blessed generations for his sake (2 Kings 8:19, 19:34, 20:6), and made good on His promise to bring the Messiah through his descendents (Psalm 89:3-4; Ezekiel 37:25; Luke 1:69). \n\nDavid’s life was marked by faith and obedience—not just in spite of his biggest mess-ups, but also because of how he repented and walked through them.\n\nOnce again, God’s grace weaves through lives that seem beyond redemption: through David’s story, your story, and mine. But we can rest assured that He is bigger than our greatest failures.\n\nThanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nEditor’s note: Some passages in 1 & 2 Samuel, namely those in Day 29, deal in subject matter which might be especially painful for some readers. Though many of the wounds we receive in this life are deeply personal and unimaginably painful, when they appear in God’s Word, we are reminded that He sees them. Whenever sin is addressed in Scripture—whether through teaching or story—it comes to us in the context of God’s unwavering commitment to bring an end to all evil in this world through the finished work of Christ (Revelation 21:3-4). We are praying for and with you as you read.\n\n________\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 12:26-31, 2 Samuel 13:1-39, 2 Samuel 14:1-33, Leviticus 18:9, Deuteronomy 22:28-29\n\n“I want to see it, Mom. I’m old enough.” This is what our daughter said to us recently as my husband and I watched the news. We flipped the channel as she walked into the room, and she objected, claiming she could handle it. She wanted, needed, to know what was happening. \n\nIt’s a hard line to toe—the line between protecting and equipping—and not just when it comes to children. Even as adults, it’s difficult to know the difference between necessary and gratuitous knowledge. The world is dark. The world is broken. We know this. But knowing in theory is not the same as knowing in fact. It takes coming face to face with the depth and darkness of sin to understand that these are not problems that can be solved with pen and paper and policy. These are problems of the heart. \n\nI know myself. And I know—at least I think I know—the sin I am capable of. I know the darkness I’ve indulged, both in thought and in action, and this knowledge chills me to the bone. But I also know the sin that has been committed against me, sins I have rarely uttered and would be thankful to forget—injustices I may not see a reckoning for this side of heaven. Songwriter Ellie Holcomb sings a line that resonates deep within me, especially when those scenes from the past come calling on my conscience: “I need a rescue, I need a reckoning for all the things I’ve done and have been done to me.” \n\nWe all need a rescue. We all yearn for a reckoning. \n\nToday’s passage contains, for me, one of the most difficult in all of Scripture. I have tears brimming in my eyes even as I type this. Tamar’s story makes my insides burn with anger and weep with sorrow at the manifestations of sin. Yet with the fire and the sorrow, I feel the tender voice of the Holy Spirit whisper to my aching heart, “I see this too. In the darkest of the dark—I am here, too.” \n\nThese passages from 2 Samuel show us the ugly truth of sin. Sin is deceitful. It is born and bred in lies. Jonadab designed a web of deceit, and Amnon was all too willing to step into it and make it his own. Sin creates desolation—utter emptiness. Amnon’s pleasure became hollow in an instant, and his sin dragged others into this misery. Sin leaves a wake of destruction. What is done cannot be undone. Yes, there is grace for the repentant, but there are still consequences.\n\nI want to gather Tamar into my arms and tell her she is seen. I want her to know that though disgraced, she is valued. I want her to know that though discarded, she is wanted. I want her to know that though dismissed—the sin committed against her gone year after year unacknowledged—that she has a God who fights for her. I want to tell her all the things I wish I could tell myself every time I’ve felt disgraced, discarded, dismissed. \n\nOur God receives us, rescues us, and restores us. This is the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nAs we stand here at the end of these tough chapters of 2 Samuel, that is all I have in my hands today. I stand, weeping for the reality and consequences of sin, holding the knowledge that we serve a God who sees. He sees us in our struggle against sin, and He offers us His righteousness and strength (Romans 5:17). He sees us when we are hurt and hollowed out, and He offers us His unending, unbreakable love (Exodus 15:13). He sees the wrongs that plague this dark, sin-stained world, and He offers us His promise to make all things new (Revelation 21:5). He vows to dry our tears, not just with His compassion but also with His justice (Revelation 21:4). \n\nYes, this world is ever so broken. But God is here. He is the Healer and Redeemer, and He is with us. \n\nThank you, Jesus, for coming to dwell with us, for giving your life for the sins of the world. Thank you, Jesus, that the gospel is true.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 15:1-37, 2 Samuel 16:1-23, 2 Samuel 17:1-29, Psalm 96:10, Isaiah 11:1-5\n\nWe think of God’s favor as an endless river of glittering gifts, but that’s not the whole story. \n\nDavid shows us that God’s favor isn’t always an easy pill to swallow. Sure, he received a kingdom from the Lord (2 Samuel 7:8). That gift came with plenty of perks, but being a man after God’s own heart also came with challenges. \n\nWhen Samuel anointed David as king, I’m sure it was a happy occasion, mostly because Samuel never mentioned the possibility of facing down a giant (1 Samuel 17), potential death threats from the existing king (1 Samuel 18-23), and the massive temptations that come with being the most powerful man in the land (2 Samuel 11). Samuel certainly didn’t mention that David would have to fight his own beloved son to keep his kingdom.\n\nWe find the story of Absalom’s rebellion in 2 Samuel 13-18. The wheels started to come off the train when David’s son Amnon raped his half-sister, Tamar. Tamar’s brother, Absalom (Amnon’s half-brother), was enraged by his brother’s sin and eventually had Amnon killed (2 Samuel 13).  \n\nThis was a low blow for David, but the hits had just started coming. Absalom fled to live with his grandparents. During that long season of waiting, a bitter root started to grow in Absalom’s heart. Though his father eventually welcomed him home with a kiss, Absalom began to plot a coup to take the throne. He launched a PR campaign, tricked 200 men into joining his cause, recruited David’s advisers, amassed an army, and prepared to march on to Jerusalem.\n\nThe same David who had been promised a kingdom that would last forever put on a disguise and ran for his life.\n\nThough the battle cost him mightily—20,000 casualties, including his own son—David kept his throne, and God kept His promises. Yes, David was highly favored by God, but that didn’t vaccinate him from hard work and heartbreak.\n\nThis story reminds me of another hero who knew the gut-wrenching reality of God’s favor.  \n\n“And the angel came to [Mary] and said, ‘Rejoice, favored woman! The Lord is with you.”\n– Luke 1:28\n\nYes, Mary was a “favored woman” with reason to rejoice. But serving God also meant suffering. The angel didn’t mention that Mary would watch her miracle boy die a horrible death on the cross.\n\nWhen we confuse God’s favor with a free ticket to Easy Street, we can find ourselves easily blindsided. As God’s child, you are highly favored, but that doesn’t mean life will never throw you a curveball. Absalom’s rebellion shows us that suffering is not a sure sign that God’s favor has left us. \n\nWill we praise God, even when His favor comes with both victories and challenges?\n\n",

    "devo_title": "David’s Kingdom Restored",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 18:1-33, 2 Samuel 19:1-43, Romans 5:7-8, 1 Timothy 1:12-17\n\nI have to admit I wanted justice to be done to Absalom. I remembered how he had treated David in prior chapters. He betrayed him. Tricked him. Risen up against him. It was wrong, and Absalom needed to be punished. Even though David had given his men strict orders not to hurt him, when Joab took advantage of Absalom’s vulnerable position and killed him, I thought to myself, Well, he deserved it. It gave me the same kind of satisfaction I have when watching a movie and the good guy finally finishes off the bad guy in the end. \n\nOf course, the Bible isn’t a movie. It’s real life. And a few verses later, I was reminded of this. When David hears of Absalom’s death, he cries out, “My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!” (2 Samuel 18:33). With those words, my sense of justice deflated and tears came to my eyes. \n\nAbsalom was David’s child. David had held him as a baby. He’d watched him grow up. He’d probably taught him to be the strong warrior he was. And though their story took a turn for the worse and reconciliation was needed, there was once a time when father and son ate meals together. They were family. \n\nWith David’s grief-stricken response to the news of his son’s death, this story of civil war  becomes a story of a father losing his son—a story not unlike our own. \n\nThe hard truth is that both Absalom and I deserved the same ending. I betray God with each sin I commit. I try to manipulate His will. I go my own way, as if I am the king of my life and He is not. \n\nThis is true of all of us. But this is also true: “God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). This is what changed the ending for us. We were headed toward a sure death due to our own sin, but God in His kindness sent His Son to die in our stead, so that we could be reconciled to our Father.  \n\nThe father-son story in 2 Samuel 18 is a tragedy. David never got to reconcile with Absalom. He did not get to give his life so Absalom could live. Though our story parallels Absalom’s, our ending turns in the opposite direction. Because of Christ, we are reconciled to our Father. Because of Christ, we have victory over death. Because of Christ, Paul’s words are ours too:\n\nChrist Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst. But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life.\n– 1 Timothy 1:15-16\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 20:1-26, 2 Samuel 21:1-22, 2 Samuel 22:1-51, Psalm 89:29-33, Revelation 20:11-15\n\nChronologically speaking, David’s Song of Thanksgiving recorded in 2 Samuel 22 belongs earlier in David’s story, closer to the beginning of the book. David probably wrote this before he was king, around the time he had been saved from Saul and realized his place on the throne was eminent. \n\nDavid was in for an eventful forty-year kingship, filled with many highs and many lows. To name a few—\n\nHigh: David is crowned king of Israel.\n\nHigh: He moves the capital of Israel to Jerusalem.\n\nLow: He commits adultery with Bathsheba and has Bathsheba’s husband killed.\n\nLow: David and Bathsheba’s son dies as a consequence of David’s sin.\n\nHigh: God forgives David for his adultery and blesses him with his son Solomon.\n\nLow: His son Absalom kills his other son Amnon to avenge the rape of Absalom’s sister Tamar.\n\nLow: Absalom tries to take the kingdom of Israel from him.\n\nHigh: David’s men defeat Absalom’s men and the kingdom is restored to him.\n\nLow: Absalom is killed in battle.\n\nDavid’s problems did not end with Saul. A rollercoaster of war, death, family rivalry, and suffering would mark his days. And as his circumstances changed, so did his character. Faithful one minute, unfaithful the next. God’s character, however, did not change. He was David’s rock during a lifetime of shifting sand.\n\nThroughout the Song of Thanksgiving, David describes God with adjectives and metaphors of strength and consistency:\n\n“The Lord is my rock, my fortress, my deliverer” (v.2).\n\n“My shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold, my refuge” (v.3).\n\n“… the Lord was my support” (v.19).\n\n“And who is a rock? Only our God” (v. 32).\n\n“The Lord lives—blessed be my rock!” (v. 47).\n\nIf you were to write down your life’s list of highs and lows, it may not be as dramatic as David’s, but I’ll bet it’s just as inconsistent. Suffering, hope, despair, joy—our circumstances are constantly changing and with them, our hearts. Faithful today, unfaithful tomorrow. But just as God intervened in David’s life and pulled him out of deep waters (2 Samuel 22:17), so did He intervene in our lives by sending Jesus Christ, who entered this world to save us from the dark waters of sin. Christ is now the rock on which we stand. The winds will change and they will change us, but His faithfulness to us will not. \n\nI like that the writer of 2 Samuel placed David’s Song of Thanksgiving at the end of the book. The words were true before David’s forty-year reign, and they were true after it. David’s change in circumstances did not signify a change in God’s character. I wonder how often he went back to the words he wrote on that day of thanksgiving. I wonder if, in his darkest nights, he clung to what he knew to be true of God then, even if it didn’t feel true in the present moment. \n\nWhat aspects of God’s character did you sing yesterday that you need to remember today? In the midst of life’s changing waters, we can be sure that we have been pulled out of the depths. That is a consistent truth. \n\nLet’s be thankful today that our character and circumstances do not change who God is or what Jesus did. As we move through life’s highs and lows, we worship a God who is the same, all the time, even when we are not. He will not take His love from us, and He will never betray His faithfulness. Thanks be to God.  \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 23:1-39, 2 Samuel 24:1-25, Micah 1:2-3, John 2:19-22\n\nThey say that at the end of life, things will become clearer. Our priorities will crystallize and our discernment will sharpen. They say no one ever lies on their deathbed and says, “I should have spent more time at the office.” No one wishes they’d been less generous, less loving, less devoted to forgiveness and reconciliation. The secret, then, is to live now with the end in mind—to live now like we’ll wish we had then. \n\nThis is what they say. But what does the Bible say?\n\nScripture is filled with flawed humans who could have lived life better. Aside from Jesus, you’ll be hard pressed to find a person whose deathbed retrospective is free of wishes or regrets. Come to think of it, the idea of finding a “secret” to outsmarting our humanity is wholly absent in the 66 books of the Bible. \n\nInstead of giving us life hacks, God’s Word gives us a promise: our life here on earth exists within our truer, eternal life with God through His Son.\n\nWhen we reach the final chapters of 2 Samuel, at the end of David’s life, we don’t find him urging us to be our best selves. We find him composing a final poem—one last expression of what he knows to be true of God and his life with God. In it, David declares:\nIs it not true my house is with God?\nFor he has established a permanent covenant with me,\nordered and secured in every detail.\nWill he not bring about\nMy whole salvation and my every desire?\n– 2 Samuel 23:5\n\nDavid’s dying thoughts don’t hinge on what he has or has not done, but rather on what God has done and continues to do. \n\nGod made a covenant with David and He ordered every detail, in David’s life and beyond, to uphold that covenant. The second half of chapter 23 gives us a glimpse into those details—a brief and profound look into God’s provision, for David and for all people of the covenant, through the exploits of David’s “Mighty Men.” \n\nThis group of more than thirty men were named and known, both by the Lord and by David. Their devotion to God’s anointed king was no accident, and neither was the bravery and might they displayed on David’s behalf. One, named Eleazar, fought until he quite literally could not go on. Verse 10 says he “stood his ground and attacked the Philistines until his hand was tired and stuck to his sword.” Even so, Scripture makes it clear that God brought about the victory that day (1 Samuel 23:10). Another, called Benaiah, “went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion” (v.20). A trio of men known as “the Three” risked their lives just to bring a thirsty, homesick King David a drink of water from his hometown well (vv.15-16). \n\nI circled their names in my study book—these warriors of the covenant who are known by name to the Lord and now to us so many generations later. It was the name at the end of the list that made my stomach lurch: Uriah the Hethite (v.39). The same Uriah who was married to Bathsheba. The same Uriah who was killed to cover up the king’s own sin. A mighty man snuffed out by a powerful one. \n\nOur stories, like David’s, are complicated. They are filled with things we did and didn’t do, things other people did and didn’t do, and the consequences that followed. We have days when we look like heroes and days when our hearts look as murderous and unfaithful as David’s did with Uriah and Bathsheba. The story told in 1 and 2 Samuel offers us only one faithful Hero—the Lord. \n\nGod’s faithfulness is the context of David’s story and ours. His sovereignty reigns over every plot point; His mercy is mightier than our regrets. By faith in God’s Son, Jesus, we can stand at the end of our days and say with David, “My house is with God. He has established a permanent covenant with me, ordered and secured in every detail. He will bring about my whole salvation.” \n\nAll glory be to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nBy whatever stroke of chance or luck (or the-opposite-of-luck), I’ve never had to follow in anyone’s footsteps when starting a new job. I’ve always stepped into an unformed role and had the joy (and challenge) of shaping it to fit the opportunities before me. \n\nBut a few months ago, that changed. I took a job that someone had held previously, and the awkwardness of learning to walk in your own shoes on someone else’s tightrope has required more grace and patience than I ever could have expected. It’s like constantly looking in a mirror but the reflection isn’t you. I feel like I’m tipping over all the sacred cows, even as I try to tread lightly while I also prove myself. It’s a mess of idols and pride, and it’s hard. \n\nDavid was the king. He was King David, a man after God’s own heart. He was King David, who brought the ark of the covenant back to Jerusalem. He was David, to whom God promised a descendant on his throne forever. The shepherd boy who became king, David was the standard against whom all other kings of Israel would be judged. Taking his place would have been daunting, but it would also lead to unprecedented power. \n\nWhen David was on his deathbed, two men believed they held claim to his throne: Adonijah and Solomon. Both wanted to step into his shoes, lead his people, and claim his fame. Adonijah was David’s oldest surviving son, but David had promised Bathsheba that their son Solomon would be the next king (1 Kings 1:13). Chaos ensued, with back-room conversations and an attempted coup. But David, when told that “the eyes of all Israel are on you to tell them who will sit on the throne” (v.20), affirmed that Solomon was his choice. \n\nChapter 2 opens with David’s charge to Solomon. It is full of encouragement to “be strong and be a man” (v.2), and admonishes the soon-to-be king to walk in God’s “ways [and] keep his statutes, commands, ordinances, and decrees” (v.3). David then reminds his son of the covenant promise God made to him: “If your sons guard their way to walk faithfully before me with all their heart and all their soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel” (v.4).\n\nOur privilege as those who hold the entire canon of the Bible is that we know how this story goes: Solomon didn’t always follow the Lord and His ways. His father David didn’t. Nor did the rest of Israel and Judah’s other kings. \n\nBut despite the failures of humankind, our God reigns. In Israel’s time of transition, God reigned. In every second before and every second after, God reigned, is reigning, and will reign forever. While our earthly leaders matter, our ultimate allegiance is to God’s Kingdom and to the perfect King of kings, Jesus. It means we can live lightly but intentionally, resting in the holy, sovereign kingship of the One who will make everything new as we advocate for His Kingdom to grow on earth here and now. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nFor a couple of years in the late ’90s, it was “cool” for girls to be ditzy. It was, like… so cute to act like you didn’t have a lot of common sense. This trend permeated culture with its linguistic “valleyspeak,” and was reinforced by iconic, pop culture movies like Clueless. As an awkward but intelligent middle school girl, I often bought into the false cultural narrative that smart girls aren’t as worthy or attractive or likely to succeed as the popular sort. I was tempted to “play dumb” in front of my peers, hoping they would like me more. It seemed (as it does so often today), that money and brands and clothes and cars were the most important things. \n\nThankfully, this phase–and middle school itself–didn’t last very long. I found bookish friends and kindred spirits, and we made it through high school with some confidence still intact. But the temptation to present myself as something more or different than who I truly am exists to this day. In every area of life, I believe I am not enough of what I ought to be, that there are things I can do to create an image of enough-ness. \n\nAfter Solomon inherited the kingship from his father David, the Lord appeared to him in a dream. God offered Solomon anything he wanted: “Ask. What should I give you?” (1 Kings 3:5).\n\nWhat temptation must have presented itself in that moment! I wonder how I would answer that question, but in my heart I know. I would probably ask for financial security, or health and safety for everyone I love. I would ask for everyone to love me. I would ask for freedom from fear and pain. I would ask for many things—all of them for me. \n\nBut Solomon asked for others, and he asked for an invisible thing: wisdom. “Yet I am just a youth with no experience in leadership,” Solomon said. “Your servant is among your people you have chosen, a people too many to be numbered or counted. So give your servant a receptive heart to judge your people and to discern between good and evil” (1 Kings 3:7–9). \n\nSolomon asked for a heart and mind shaped more by God than by the world. And God answered that prayer lavishly. Solomon gained supernatural wisdom but also fame, wealth, and honor worldwide. “Emissaries of all peoples, sent by every king on earth who had heard of his wisdom, came to listen to Solomon’s wisdom,” (1 Kings 4:34).\n\nWhen Solomon judged wisely, he didn’t claim the fame for himself either—at least, not at first. After the infamous baby cutting story (1 Kings 3:16–28), the glory was God’s. “All Israel heard about the judgment the king had given, and they stood in awe of the king because they saw that God’s wisdom was in him to carry out justice” (v.28). \n\nGod doesn’t regularly appear to me in dreams, offering me whatever my heart desires. But Scripture does tell me that when I petition the Lord, He hears me. “This is the confidence we have before him: If we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears whatever we ask, we know that we have what we have asked of him,” (1 John 5:14–15). When we seek wisdom, we should seek “God—who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly—and it will be given” to us (James 1:5).\n\nWhen I measure my prayers against Solomon’s, I see how material and vapid they tend to be. Yes, health, financial security, and safety are valid requests to bring to God. But the undergirding theme of my prayers should be about the shape of my heart, mind, and will, that they would be abounding with the wisdom of God and aligned with His mission to bring peace, shalom, and abundance to His people and His world. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Building the Temple",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI love looking at real estate online. I love flipping open an app and scanning houses both nearby and far away, homes that I might one day be able to afford (probably not), and dream about the parties I could host, the backyard adventures my kids could have, and the ideal life one of these houses would surely provide me. \n\nCurrently, I live in a very nice house that we built a few years ago. We chose the finishes and the floors, everything down to the grout. I love every room, and it is more than I ever could have imagined owning. And yet, I spend a lot of time window shopping for a new house. My heart beats to the rhythm of what’s next, what’s better, what would make my life more. More what? I don’t always know. But I am always chasing it. \n\nSolomon built an extravagant temple for the Lord. Every detail mattered, the length of the doorways and the beveled frames for each window. It mattered where the stones were finished (at the quarry) and how gold was overlaid on the interior walls. We know the details mattered because they are written in Scripture, in God’s revelation to His people. The temple was a stunning architectural achievement, built with detail for the holy God of Israel. \n\nAnd yet, Solomon kept building. This time, he built for himself. He was chasing more. It took twenty years to build God’s temple and then Solomon’s palace. Solomon’s story will unfold over the next few chapters of 1 Kings, but we start to see glimpses here of what is to come. Solomon’s itch for more—a bigger palace, more wives, places of worship for other gods—begins to present itself, and it will slowly unravel his kingship. \n\nKing Solomon was on top of his world. He was the most famous, wealthiest, wisest king in all the earth. But his need for more would eventually be his undoing. In 1 Kings 6:13, God made this promise to Solomon: “If you walk in my statutes, observe my ordinances, and keep all my commands by walking in them, I will fulfill my promise to you, which I made to your father David. I will dwell among the Israelites and not abandon my people Israel.”\n\nSolomon didn’t keep God’s commands, but the Lord did keep His promise. I think we will always itch for more until the fulfillment of God’s kingdom, when all tears will dry and we will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. That is the house I should crave, not this world’s version of a perfect home or false security. I want to crave the perfect peace, righteousness, and future that God promises me through Jesus. One day in His presence is better than a thousand elsewhere (Psalm 84:10). May God continue to make over my heart with a longing for Him and His house alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nOur house is a wreck. At the moment, each piece of furniture we own resides in the middle of its designated room, covered in plastic wrap. The master bathroom is halfway through a renovation, which means that it currently looks worse than it did before the hammer first fell. A crew of painters came last week and rolled our walls white. There are a few unfinished places: a patch in the living room, a circle around the dining room chandelier. Yesterday, our contractor went to open a box containing two porcelain sinks for the bathroom, and as soon as he touched the box, the contents inside clinked and scratched like a windchime. We knew they were broken. He laughed and wiped his nose. I, on the other hand, said some things I’m not so proud of.\n\nConstruction is not easy. But through it all, I’ve held onto the hope of what’s to come: a restful, fresh retreat for our family to enjoy for years to come. A place to connect with the people I love, where I will leave renewed to face the trials of the world. When it’s finished—God, please let them finish—I will be the first to sing, “Hallelujah!”\n\nThat’s what’s happening in today’s reading of 1 Kings on a far grander, more historic scale. King David dreamed of building a temple worthy of God’s glory—but God reserved the joy of building that temple for his son Solomon. Temple construction had ended, but Solomon knew the job wasn’t complete until the ark of the covenant resided inside. For context, keep in mind that, years earlier, when the Israelites moved the ark, someone died (2 Samuel 6). This was no laughing matter. And though Solomon threw an epic celebration to welcome the ark, no doubt the people trembled with fear and as it was moved into its rightful home. \n\nIt’s interesting to me that Solomon’s prayer of dedication addresses a list of worst-case-scenarios: When we are defeated. When there is a drought. When there is famine. If his prayer tells us anything, it’s that the temple wasn’t a magical place to avoid the pain of the world. It was a sacred place to be with God in the midst of that sorrow. He prays that God will forgive, save, and redeem His people, even in the midst of every possible catastrophe. Solomon’s prayer ends with a reminder of why they built the temple in the first place: so that “all the peoples of the earth would know that the LORD is God. There is no other!” (1 Kings 8:60). All this work was to remind the world of the truth: God wants to be with his people. \n\nAnd he wants to be with us too. So much so, that He didn’t stop moving toward us after Solomon built his temple. Several hundred years later, Jesus was born in Bethlehem. When He began His teaching ministry, Jesus shared radically great news—a time was coming when we wouldn’t have to go to a particular place to commune with God (John 4:21, 23). Because of Jesus’s work on the cross, God can commune with us always, without the barrier of a building. By God’s Spirit, we are welcome to be present in the holy of holies, near to God, sharing in Jesus’s glory right this second. \n\nHow do we know this is true? In His final prayer before He was betrayed and crucified, Jesus asks God the Father to be as near to us as He was to Jesus. Jesus asks for God to do a construction project in our hearts. He prays for us, saying, “I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them” (John 17:26).\n\nEven Solomon’s temple in all of its splendor wasn’t as remarkable as the temple that God occupies in the center of our spirit. God is where He wants to be: with us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nI recently discovered a website that sells bona fide designer items at discounted prices. (However, even at a “discount,” everything is still way out of my price range.) Surfing this site is like taking a sneak peek into a famous, wildly wealthy person’s closet. I’m not actually indulging. I’m just browsing! But the slope is steep. I know from past experience that I can easily go from browsing, to buying, to justifying in about two-point-five seconds flat. \n\nOur culture is obsessed with wealth, beauty, and sexuality. Social media influencers attempt to sell me expensive clothes, face oils, and procedures, showing me what life could look like if I had access to more—more money, more freedom, more of everything. And yet, for all their photos of fancy clothes, private jets, and exotic places, no one has risen to the level of King Solomon at the height of his wealth and influence. It was out of control and unfathomable.\n\nLong story short? Solomon got caught up in the things of this world, not only in the trappings of his wealth, but in the sexual power it gave him over women. The numbers are staggering: seven hundred wives, three hundred concubines— I mean, how would one even have the time for a thousand lovers? It’s safe to say that many of these women weren’t there by choice. The evil in many of Solomon’s actions would be hard to calculate in terms that would translate to today’s world. At the very least, he was an idolator and an adulterer to the highest degree. In the beginning, wealth gave Solomon freedom. In the end, it enslaved him.\n\nEvery time he added possessions and people to his entourage, Solomon believed he was gaining power. In reality, he was giving himself away. Bit by bit, the wisdom and character that had made him famous faded as his unfaithfulness to a faithful God grew. But it wasn’t wisdom and character or wealth that had built his kingdom—the Lord did all of that. While He did bless Solomon with “a wise and understanding heart” and even the “riches and honor” he hadn’t asked for, the blessing was always tied to Solomon’s commitment to walk in God’s “ways and keep [His] statutes” (1 Kings 3:12–14). In other words, Solomon would have to choose God’s wisdom over his own—every single day. Instead, “Solomon did what was evil in the LORD’s sight, and unlike his father David, he did not remain loyal to the LORD” (1 Kings 11:6).\n\nWealth has a way of making me believe the absolute lie that I don’t need God. I know the slippery slope firsthand. And while Solomon’s actions are unfathomable, if I had been given all the wealth in the world, I hope that my heart would remain pure. But I don’t know for sure. Solomon lost sight of his need for God. It’s easy for me to do the same. \n\nJesus, help me to fix my eyes on You. Close my eyes to anything that would give me the illusion of power, pleasure, or position. May my life remain fully dependent on You, the One who creates all, gives all, and has within Him the power, wisdom, and the right to take it all away.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nAs far as I know, there were no prophecies about me when I was born. I was one of those blissful “surprise” babies, a child that arrived into the world without permission from her parents. My mother has recounted the tale many times, and I won’t bore you with the details, but needless to say, many “security gates” were jumped in order for me to exist. Today, my mother tells me that, while they might not have thought they wanted me, God knew they needed me. And I believe her. After all, He went through quite a bit of trouble to make sure I got here.\n\nWhen I sat down to read this long passage in 1 Kings, I was immediately struck by the number of prophecies that are attached to this one family. How did they keep track? And when Rehoboam came to power after his father Solomon died, did he know that the Lord was about to tear his kingdom in two? \n\nImagine if he had known of the prophecy. Was his ego puffed up by fear, fueled by the prophecies—prophecies that were not in his favor? It would be a deadly mix leading to a whole lot of posturing, pretending to have strength, rather than turning to God to be strengthened by Him. After all, He is the source of all true wisdom and strength. \n\nRehoboam’s leadership style was vindictive and harsh, perhaps because he assumed that those qualities and that leadership style would translate into strength. Maybe he thought that if he took control of the reins, he could avoid the prophesied loss of power. Instead, his feigned strength led to the exact result he was trying to avoid. After watching his father Solomon rise in wealth and power, Rehoboam was cut down to size. \n\nWhat does this mean for us? And what does it tell us about God?\n\nFirst, we must see that God takes His vows seriously. What He says happens. There is no false posturing, no ego, no vindictive stripe in our God. He doesn’t punish in order to prove His power. He follows through on His word, because His word is good and always comes to fruition. Second, we must see that God holds a high standard for His people, one that requires our faith and trust be placed in Him alone. The division and destruction we see in 1 Kings happened because God allows it, but not because He wants it. Instead, He calls us to live “with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace” (Ephesians 4:2–3).\n\nGod wants His people to be united as one, and so, the Bible is ultimately a tale of restoration—how one man born of one tiny tribe, Judah, is the true and righteous King. He came not just for Israel, and not just for Judah. He came for the entire world.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nAt this point in our reading, the nation of Israel is divided into the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Both kingdoms and their kings are in political turmoil as they face mounting instability, warfare, revolts, and murder. The kingdoms are also in spiritual crisis. King after king “did what was evil in the LORD’s sight” (1 Kings 15:26). They endorsed detestable idol worship, which emboldened the people to set up poles and stones and high places for pagan gods and to engage in shrine prostitution, along with other evil practices. Verse after verse, we read of people who have forsaken the one true God in exchange for worthless, false gods. \n\nAs I read of one evil king after another, I find myself hoping that maybe, just maybe, the next one might be faithful. With that in mind, I find myself cheering as I finally read about Asa, King of Judah, a king who finally “did what was right in the eyes of the Lord.” He abolished shrine prostitution, removed idols, and directed his people back to the Lord’s laws and commands. Asa ruled for 41 years and promoted flourishing and peace for most of his reign.\n\nAsa’s life is a picture of the good, gracious provision of God. His father, Abijam, was not faithful to the Lord, “but for the sake of David, the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up his son after him and preserving Jerusalem” (v.4). In the midst of Abijah’s disobedience, God provided a righteous son who would lead his people. King Asa was a lamp shining God’s light and truth. Finally, a hero in this story!\n\nEh. Not so fast. In 2 Chronicles 16 we read that toward the end of Asa’s reign, as the northern kingdom was threatening Judah, he faltered and trusted in his own power and plans instead of relying on the Lord. Despite shining like a lamp of righteousness for a time, Asa would not even seek help from the Lord as he suffered at the end of his days. While Israel and Judah’s kings floundered in the face of their commitment to the Lord, He remained true to them, keeping this promise to David: \n\n“My faithful love will never leave him as it did when I removed it from Saul,  whom I removed from before you. Your house and kingdom will endure before me forever,  and your throne will be established forever” (2 Samuel 17:15–16).\n\nThe life of King Asa gives us a glimmer of the deliverance that we long for, as well as the realization that it’s futile to trust in kings, or anyone, really—even ourselves. But we sure do try, looking to friends and parents, pastors and employers and political leaders—only to be disappointed, because they stumble and fall and fail too. Though our hope is misplaced, it isn’t pointless; God plants this hope and hunger in us to point us to the King of kings, the ultimate hero, Jesus, who never falters. He is not only a lamp for Jerusalem, but the light of the world (John 8:12).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nCue the following: a wicked king, a brave prophet, provisions delivered by ravens, a showdown between heavenly powers, and divine fire and rain. Oh, and pass the popcorn, please.\n\nNo, this is not the plot summary of a Hollywood blockbuster. It’s a battle between idolatry and faithfulness found in 1 Kings. This account certainly doesn’t lack drama. The prophet Elijah has been called by God to confront King Ahab. Idolatry had infiltrated Israel as this unfaithful king promoted the worship of Baal, a pagan god of fertility and rain. \n\nGod chose Elijah, whose name means “Yahweh is my God,” to be His mouthpiece to His people. But Elijah’s name was also a heads-up, a signal to His uncompromising message: there is only one God, Yahweh, and only He should be worshiped.\n\nA clear line is drawn as the showdown reaches its climax. Two altars piled high with wood are assembled, and a sacrificial, slaughtered bull is placed atop each altar. One is presented to Baal and the other to Yahweh. Elijah instructs, “Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The God who answers by fire, he is God” (1 Kings 18:24). The false prophets of Baal call out to their god, shouting, dancing, and working themselves into a frenzy—but not a peep nor a spark comes from Baal.\n\nThen, to further prove his point, Elijah has his altar drenched with water three times before he humbly prays that God would answer and turn the hearts of the people back to Himself (1 Kings 18:37). Of course, the fire of the Lord does fall, completely incinerating the offering and its altar. But God does more than answer with intense fire; He releases a heavy rain, ending years of drought. The one, true God is revealed. At the same time, the false god of fertility is exposed as impotent, and the false god of storms is all washed up.\n\nWhat a picture of mercy! After their rejection of Him, God could have brought punishment, but instead He shows compassion. His people had turned from Him, forgotten His love and provision, and abandoned His commands. Yet, God doesn’t turn away, nor is He is silent or indifferent to them. He answers and gathers His people back to Himself. \n\nIf I’m honest, I can relate; I, too, can work myself into a frenzy seeking action from false, futile gods. I may not dance for Baal, but how often do I bow down to money, image, achievement, reputation, health, or people pleasing? Any and all things can function as an idol, if we place them ahead of God. But don’t be fooled: every idol demands worship, and in the end delivers nothing. God alone should be our source of identity and worth, safety and hope.\n\nI’m ashamed to admit that in the morning, before my feet even hit the floor, my mind spins with what I think I must accomplish. My anxiety about managing my world revs up. Ignoring God and depending solely on myself is as tempting as hitting the snooze button. I so easily forget God and His commands, promises, and provision. Is it any wonder that my efforts can seem impotent and my plans washed up?\n\nBut God doesn’t leave me with my head hanging down in shame. Instead of rejecting or abandoning me, He rains down mercy as He speaks to me through His Word and gently turns my face back toward Him. God is not silent, and He does not turn away. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kimberly Girard\n\nConfession: I am a people-pleaser, which means I often put people on the throne of my life when, in reality, that is God’s rightful place. I know this truth, but I still fall into worrying about what people think of me, my words, and my actions.\n\nBut people-pleasing was apparently not much of an issue for the prophet Micaiah, who was perfectly fine with upsetting evil King Ahab—he only wanted to please and honor God. Ahab isn’t too fond of Micaiah’s prophesying, admitting to Jehosophat, “There is still one man who can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him because he never prophesies good about me, but only disaster” (1 Kings 22:8). \n\nKnowing this to be true, Ahab’s servant “who went to call Micaiah instructed him, ‘Look, the words of the prophets are unanimously favorable for the king. So let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably’” (v.13). The messenger wanted the Lord’s prophet to choose to side with the majority, to make things easy. But to Micaiah, the choice was not his to make. “As the LORD lives,” he says, “I will say whatever the LORD says to me” (v.14).\n\nAhab called four hundred prophets to assure him he would be victorious in battle—four hundred prophets who had been instructed by a lying, evil spirit to tell King Ahab what he wanted to hear: that he would be successful (vv.20–23). But Jehosophat, the king of Judah who’d been witness to all of this, did not trust them, which is why he’d asked to see “a prophet of the LORD” in the first place (v.7).\n\nUpon his arrival, “Micaiah told him, ‘March up and succeed. The LORD will hand it over to the king”—a message Ahab doesn’t believe because he doesn’t like the messenger (vv.15–16). And that’s when the Lord allows Micaiah to pull back the curtain to reveal Ahab’s true fate: “You see, the LORD has put a lying spirit into the mouth of all these prophets of yours, and the LORD has pronounced disaster against you” (vv.17,19–23). But Ahab does not listen, and he dies in battle (vv.29–38).\n\nMicaiah stood against the word of four hundred other prophets. He spoke the truth boldly to Ahab, who hated him. And he declared before them all, “I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and the whole heavenly army was standing by him at his right hand and at his left hand” (1 Kings 22:19). Micaiah chose to be obedient to the Lord who is enthroned above all kingdoms and rulers, all powers and principalities (Colossians 1:16; Ephesians 6:12; 1:20–23).\n\nThis is our reality as well, even when we choose to put someone or something else on the throne of our lives, elevating them above Him in our hearts. The truth of who God is does not change. He still graciously pursues us, drawing us into repentance, offering His mercy again and again, even in the midst of our sin (Romans 5:8). The one who has power over all shows compassion to those who fear Him (Psalm 103:12–13). “Bless the LORD, all his works in all the places where he rules. My soul, bless the LORD!” (v.22)\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nWay back in the Garden of Eden, our foreparents enjoyed a fleeting moment of sin-free existence. This meant, among other things, that separation was a foriegn concept to them. Adam and Eve were united with creation, united with each other, and united with their Creator. No sin was present to drive a wedge between their hearts and God’s. Unity was the natural order of things. In contrast, our lives are lived in the fallen world. Painful separations are nearly constant as a result. Sin separates hearts. Sin divides homes. Sin keeps us from Eden, pulling us away from perfect unity with our holy God. \n\nHere, in 2 Kings 2, Elisha was dealing with separation anxiety. His instincts told him he would soon be disconnected from his predecessor, Elijah. Everyone he met felt the need to confirm these suspicions but Elisha couldn’t seem to bear the thought. “Keep quiet,” he whispered when Elijah’s departure was mentioned (2 Kings 2:3)—as if failure to discuss it could have prevented him from losing someone dear. Every time Elijah tried to pull away, Elisha held on a little tighter. He refused to separate from his mentor one second before he had to. \n\nElisha must have known Elijah was heaven-bound. After seeing the ways God had used the life of his friend, he surely did not grieve without hope in God’s power and care. Any doubts that Elijah was heading somewhere better surely evaporated when he was taken up on chariots of fire within a supernatural whirlwind (vv.11–12). And yet, even when we know the promises of God to be true, even when we trust He has something more for us, separation stings. We simply weren’t built for it. \n\nWhen the moment of separation finally came, Elisha cried out, “My father, my father!” (v.12), tore his clothes, and sat down in the dirt, giving outward expression to His deep grief over the loss of Elijah. His words remind me of another moment in Scripture—the moment on the cross when the Son cried out in anguish to the Father:\n\n“About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out with a loud voice, ‘Elí, Elí, lemá sabachtháni?’ that is, ‘My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?’” (Matthew 27:46). \n\nJesus uttered these words right before the temple curtain was torn from top to bottom (Mark 15:38), an outward expressions of God’s power and His grace toward us. Jesus knew heaven was near and trusted the power and care of His Father, and yet, what He endured was tremendously painful. For once and for all time, our sinless Savior willingly endured the punishment for sins we deserved so that we might be united with Him again for all eternity.\n\nYes, this broken world is painful. We’re in good company if we respond with worried whispers and white knuckles when death comes for someone we love. But because of Jesus, separation is only temporary. Through the cross He built a bridge, a way back to Eden’s promise that someday we will be fully united with Christ, never to be separated again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nIn Genesis chapter 18, the Lord asked the patriarch Abraham this very important question: “Is anything impossible for the LORD?” (v.14). It was a rhetorical question, of course. I doubt that God was expecting Abraham to somehow calculate and answer Him based on some silly human formula. He was, after all, about to give Abraham a baby at the age of one hundred, and then use Abraham’s family line to birth both a nation and a Savior. \n\nThe answer to God’s question was “no,” of course—nothing is impossible for God. The angel Gabriel came right out with it when he told Mary she would become the mother of the world’s Savior (Luke 1:37). And Jesus Himself relayed the same truth in Matthew 19, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible” (v.26).\n\nA core belief in God’s unlimited power seems to be the backbone of Elisha’s ministry, a steel rod running through His life that allowed him to pray and serve with remarkable conviction, and with good cause. He had seen a number of astonishing miracles: wicked kings dethroned (1 Kings 22:37), armies consumed by fire from heaven (2 Kings 1:10), his mentor, Elijah, carried up into heaven in a whirlwind (2 Kings 2:11), and unhealthy water transformed into clean water with a pinch of salt (2 Kings 2:21–22).\n\nOver and over again, Elisha had a front row seat to the power of God. So when the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom commanded him to bring forth water from a dry ditch, Elisha’s faith was automatic, when he responded, “This is an easy thing in the LORD’s sight” (2 Kings 3:18).\n\nMaybe, like me, you’re tempted to compare notes with Elisha, to explain away weak faith with all you haven’t seen. True, I’ve never seen an army consumed with fire from heaven, and I haven’t watched anyone ride a whirlwind up to heaven. But I’ve seen the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living (Psalm 27:13). I’ve seen Him heal. I’ve felt His comfort. I’ve been transformed by His grace. \n\nWhen faced with the impossible, I press in to this truth: the greatest indicator of what God will do is what He has already done. He is a God who does not change, the healer who keeps healing, the deliverer who keeps delivering, and our Savior who keeps saving. \n\nGo on. Look around your life. Do you see the dry places where you need God’s Spirit to move? Dare to ask the angel’s question, “Is anything impossible for the Lord?” The answer is in every moment of goodness and mercy He has already shown you. May you pray with renewed confidence knowing that, whatever your need is, it is an easy thing in the Lord’s sight. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kimberly Girard\n\nWar, murder, and unthinkable tragedies are all a part of today’s reading. Yet even in the face of horrific evil, we see the Lord providing. From recovering an axe head to providing food to a starving people, the Lord provides again and again. The atrocities we see in the world around us, or even in our own hearts, can sometimes blind us from seeing the Lord at work on our behalf. But it is in the especially difficult seasons and situations that we need to pray, as Elisha did, that God would open our eyes to all the ways He provides for us.\n\nRecently, a good friend shared how, over the course of several weeks, she had prayed for eyes to see the ways the Lord provides for her family—and how He did just that, abundantly so. Her faith encouraged me to pray that the Lord would also open my eyes to see how He provides for my family. And it was unbelievable! He graciously revealed all the big and small ways He works to supply us with what we need, how He has been providing for us all along. In big and small and unexpected ways, I began to see that His provision was all around us—even in the form of a canceled baseball game that freed us up to enjoy a rare, unrushed afternoon.\n\nGod is in the details of our lives, just as surely as He was in the details of Elisha’s life. The prophet clearly saw the Lord’s provision, and He wanted his servant to see it too. \n\n“Then Elisha prayed, ‘LORD, please open his eyes and let him see.’  So the LORD opened the servant’s eyes,  and he saw that the mountain was covered with horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha” (2 Kings 6:17).\n\nWhen we are able to see beyond our myopic perception of the world—free to behold the reality of God’s glory and majesty, sovereignty and grace—that is a gift from Him. All Elisha did was humbly ask for God to open the servant’s eyes, to let him see God’s power in that moment, as it really is. \n\nSome days we may see huge, miraculous provision from Him, like those Elisha saw. Other days, we may see what seem like smaller glimpses of Him at work, and sometimes, we may be called to lean in to the promise of His presence. And on those days when we cannot see His provision at all, we are free to approach the throne of grace with confidence (Hebrews 4:16) and ask our Father to open our eyes, remembering that His ultimate provision for us is His Son, our Savior, Jesus Christ, who said, “Don’t be afraid, little flock, because your Father delights to give you the kingdom” (Luke 12:32).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Maria Furlough\n\nHow does it make you feel to hear someone blame God when bad things happen? Or when you find something difficult to understand or accept in Scripture—how does that affect you? For me, so many conflicting thoughts, theories, and perceptions can seep into my heart, creating doubt that threatens to weaken my faith. This is what I thought of when reading through today’s passages, when God calls Elisha to anoint Jehu as Israel’s king.\n\n“This is what the LORD God of Israel says: ‘I anoint you king  over the LORD’s people, Israel. You are to strike down the house  of your master Ahab so that I may avenge the blood shed by the hand of Jezebel— the blood of my servants the prophets and of all the servants of the LORD’” (2 Kings 9:6–7).\n\nI am so grateful that we know the context of all that came before this! Reading through 1 and 2 Kings, I am often reminded of why God’s story needs to be read straight through and in its entirety. Out of context, some pieces of the story do not fit, and can even seem to conflict. But with the whole story, we see God working in and through all things, which strengthens our hope in a powerful God, who is who He says He is and does what He says He will do. We see through the entirety of Scripture that God gives His people ample opportunities to reform, warning them that should they not repent and turn back to Him, the outcome will not be good. Still, they don’t always listen. \n\nBut rest assured, when God says something will happen, it will happen. In 2 Kings 9:22, King Jehu goes to Jezebel to fulfill what God predicted through the prophet Elijah fourteen years earlier (1 Kings 21:23–24). And so when Jehu obeys God’s command to kill Jezebel, who brought about “so much prostitution and sorcery,” his actions were “[fulfilling] the LORD’s word that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite” (2 Kings 9:36).\n\nThe God we serve is mighty and just. He cannot be overthrown and will not be mocked, yet He is gracious to give us fair warning as to where our sinful choices will ultimately lead us. Though these verses describing violent scenes might cause us to squirm, may we instead rest our eyes on our Savior, whose death and resurrection have brought us redemption and hope through His own blood being shed. These passages point to our need for salvation, our need for Jesus.\n\nThe God of Israel is the one “who does wonders… the whole earth is filled with his glory” (Psalm 72:18–19). Jehu trusted this, despite not fully understanding what God was doing. He knew that when God calls, you answer that call. When He commands, you obey. Through the difficult, uncomfortable, and hard-to-explain things of this life, may our devotion and zeal for the Lord sustain us in all situations (2 Kings 10:16).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Maria Furlough\n\nYes! The Israelites finally figured it out! God’s people are finally back in step with Him, and everything looks so promising (2 Kings 11:17). No more altars to worship Baal, no more Jezebel. Instead, a king has been appointed who will listen to instruction from the Lord’s priest. Israel has changed its ways! \n\nWe long for the complete demolishing of idolatry to be true in our own lives. Our very spirits grieve knowing that we were created for perfect unity with God, yet our sinfulness continually gets in the way. Like us, Israel doesn’t keep it together for long. “Throughout the time the priest Johoiada instructed him, Joash did what was right in the LORD’s sight. Yet the high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on the high places” (2 Kings 12:2–3). God’s people held on to just a few of their old ways. The Israelites wanted to serve God, but they wouldn’t do it fully. Old cultural habits would seep in and distract them and pull them away from worshiping the one true God. \n\nAt the onset, it’s tempting to judge the Israelites for their failures. We can look back and see all the ways God has proven Himself faithful. We see all the times they were warned about coming judgment and consequences, and we stand shocked at their perpetual disobedience. But are we really so different from them?\n\nIf I’m honest, sometimes I like a side dish of God while I leave the main course of my life to idol worship. I give my main allegiance to the high places I build up to worship such things as physical attractiveness, success, health, comfort, control, security, money. My altars may look different, but they still push God to the side. Still, God is faithful, even when I am not.\n\nGod never left Israel. Through all their division, defiance, and death, God always stayed true. He didn’t give up on them, and He will never give up on us. Despite their philandering hearts, “the LORD was gracious to them, had compassion on them, and turned toward them because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He was not willing to destroy them. Even now he has not banished them from his presence” (2 Kings 13:23).\n\nAt times we may become discouraged—sad that our world, our culture, our church, our neighborhood, or our school will never get it “right.” This sadness is right and good, because in our sorrow, we are agreeing with God that all is not as it should be. God knows this world is broken, and He knows us inside and out. He still loves us and always will. He pursues us with relentless passion. It is because of God’s determinate love that we have unstoppable hope. “Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion. It cannot be shaken” (Psalm 125:1). Yes, we should be diligent in tearing down any altars that threaten to lure our affection away from Christ—they all have to go—but our ability to trust in the Lord is sustained by Him alone. God’s story for Israel does not end in 2 Kings. It is only a part of God’s eternal love story with His people. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nEvery fall I get the strange urge to flip on a football game. Not because I particularly like, or even really understand, football. But because there is something cozy about a game playing in the background as I consume cheese-filled dips and nod off on the couch. Growing up, my family was into football, so I guess it brings a sense of familiarity. As one who doesn’t follow the sport with any real investment, I tend to cheer for whichever team is predicted to lose. There is just something compelling about an underdog. When all the odds are stacked against them, nobody believes they can pull it off. And yet, seemingly out of nowhere, they can make an interception and turn the whole game around in their favor. It’s not only the unexpected excitement of a good underdog story that I love, but also the perseverance of the team that I admire. \n\nThe Bible is full of underdog stories. One of the greatest underdog stories in the Bible is the story of Israel. God chose to perform His mightiest acts through a small, obscure people. In choosing to bless the world through the descendants of Abraham, the Lord backed the underdogs. Not the wealthiest or most powerful, Israel was ruled by broken rulers. Why would God choose this group of people? Perhaps so there could be no doubt about whose saving power was at work. \n\nDuring the reign of the wicked king Jeroboam son of Jehoash, the people were suffering, and “there was no one to help Israel” (2 Kings 14:26). God showed mercy to the Israelites because He had made a promise. And when God makes a promise, He does not break it. The Lord promised to preserve His people, so He saved them by the hand of their broken leader. It looked like they would meet their demise, but by the power of the Lord, the dry bones of Israel were given new life (Ezekiel 37:1–14).\n\nThis story should give us confidence in what the Lord has called us to. No matter what circumstances you may be facing, if the Lord has called you to a mighty work, He will see it through. You may feel like the underdog, with all the odds stacked against you, but you’re not in this fight alone. No, you have the great High King in your corner, and He cannot lose. You may be questioning the call God has placed in your heart, asking, Why would God choose me? But like Israel, God does not bestow His favor on those who are worthy, but on those whom He loves.\n\n“Let us not become weary in doing good,” but hold on to our hope in the Lord, continuing to fight the good fight (Galatians 6:9). God has the power to breathe new life into our bones, so me must drink deeply of His Spirit. In the end, we have nothing to sweat because Christ has already defeated death, and we will rise victorious by the power of His resurrection. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nMy first year of college I was blessed with a Southern roommate. We became the best of friends, but it wasn’t without some cultural clashes. One such example was when we stayed up late into the night debating the value of grits versus oatmeal, to the dismay of our third roommate. That year, I visited my friend’s childhood home over Thanksgiving break, and that is when my Yankee eyes were truly opened to the strong influences of the South. Surrounded by sweet tea, I found myself effortlessly adopting a phrase I’d sworn off completely: “y’all.” Not two weeks earlier, I’d argued, “It’s not even a real word!” Yet there I was, sounding as if I’d always been a Southern belle. \n\nIt’s a silly example of a larger principle. If we’re not careful, we can easily change our beliefs to fit our surroundings. This was certainly true for the Israelites. God established His covenant with them and taught them the right way to live, but they adopted the false gods of the nations they had defeated. They worshiped the idols around them even though they knew the one true God. The Lord warned them to turn back to Him through “every prophet and every seer” but they would not listen (2 Kings 17:13). And ultimately, God allowed them to become captives so they could realize their captivity. \n\nThere is a warning for us in this story—the question is whether or not we will heed it. We are all aware that today’s culture worships many idols: from financial status to career achievement, personal beauty to perfect-looking families. These things become idols when we bow down to them in worship. When we hang our happiness on their outcomes instead of turning to God for true joy. \n\nIf we’re really honest with ourselves, I’m guessing every one of us will find we struggle with some idol or another. None of us are perfect, and by the blood of Jesus, there is grace for that. But what should really scare us is that we so easily make the same mistakes Israel once made, when they “followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves” (2 Kings 17:15). \n\nIf we get so wrapped up in chasing the American Dream or building our social media platforms, we might look up one day and realize we’ve wasted our lives. We might find that we were only giving lip service to God, while giving actual power to much lesser things. Although the false gods of our culture don’t have literal golden shrines, they are very real and very seductive. And like Israel, we are at risk of ignoring the warning and willingly enslaving ourselves to idols that will never satisfy.\n\nLet’s not wait for the Lord to issue us a painful wakeup call before we turn back to Him. Let’s not waste weeks, months, or even years of our lives chasing idols that leave us wanting. Instead, may we listen to the warning from our God and direct our worship to Him. He alone can satisfy. He alone is good. “Let anyone who has ears listen” (Matthew 11:15). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nI remember waking up at night when I was a little girl and feeling the heat of a Florida summer in my grandparents’ house. Tiptoeing down the hallway that held childhood photos of my mom, her siblings, and a painting of Jesus (we’d always joke that He was the favorite child), I’d sneak into the bathroom for a sip of water, only to realize the adults were still awake. Quietly scurrying down the hallway and pausing where the carpet met the hardwood floors of the living room, I’d hide behind the entryway and listen in. \n\nMy Grandmother and Papa were almost always reading the Bible aloud to each other, taking turns reading chapters and nodding heads. Then, they’d bow their heads in prayer. I always felt an urge to leave when this happened, feeling that it was too intimate of a moment to secretly witness, but I was also extremely curious. What did adults talk about after the kids went to bed? What do they ask God for?\n\nSometimes I feel the same way when I read prayers in the Bible, and Hezekiah’s is no exception. He’d already declared, “Today day is a day of trouble” (2 Kings 19:3, NLT), and he was in deep mourning after receiving a report that confirmed the enemy’s dedication to to the destruction of Jerusalem. But as we read this account and get to peer into how someone else handles the darkness, there are two things that stand out.\n\nFirst, Hezekiah doesn’t sugarcoat his situation. He doesn’t ignore how bad it is or try to find the silver lining right away. He is in trouble, and he is honest about it. Second, he immediately takes it to the house of God. He doesn’t spend time strategizing solutions or wondering, Why me? He doesn’t try to clean up the situation before he invites God into the mess of it. \n\nGod does not call us to deny our circumstances, nor does He ask us to sit in them alone. The words of Hezekiah’s prayer weren’t as important as the act of his asking. The same goes for us when we want to take note of the eloquent phrases our loved ones use in prayer, or when we feel like we don’t have any words left. Prayer is not a one-sided speech; it is an ongoing invitation to conversation with God. May we approach our own prayers in the darkness in the same way. May we see them as an opportunity to invite God into our daily lives and ask Him to intervene on our behalf. And may we pursue God in prayer, seeking to glorify Him and acknowledge His goodness, even when both seem hidden to us. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nSometimes I joke about writing a memoir called, Parking Lots I’ve Cried In. Now that I think about it, it will have to be a picture book, full of maps, graphs, and infographics like, “The bowling alley parking lot where I got in my first fender bender,” “The church parking lot where my high school boyfriend dumped me,” and “The grocery store parking lot where I bought and ate an entire cookie cake after a bad day.”\n\nAs you’ve probably gathered, these instances weren’t planned, nor were they content set-ups for my future bestseller. The last thing I want is to cry in public, but I usually can’t hold in my tears until I’m behind closed doors. (Incidentally, one of my friends recently taught me that forcing yourself to rhyme—lime, crime, time, etc.—can distract your brain enough to stop you from crying.) I don’t want to feel myself crying, and I definitely don’t want anyone to see my tears. \n\nOf course, most of the things we cry about are those we’d want to forget entirely, not write in a memoir. That was the case of Hezekiah when he became very ill, and while he prayed facing a wall (instead of in a parking lot), we can see that he, too, was in a very vulnerable position. In 2 Kings 20, we read the words of his prayer: “‘Please, LORD, remember how I have walked before you faithfully and wholeheartedly and have done what pleases you’” (v.3). And then he wept bitterly, and honestly before God. \n\nHezekiah’s prayer points to the old covenant, in which God blessed His people in response to their faithfulness to the covenant. In his most desperate time of need, Hezekiah asks God to validate whether or not he is worthy to approach the throne and ask for healing. And It’s easy to believe that this is the takeaway of Hezekiah’s story, that “good people” deserve good things. I don’t know about you, but that hasn’t always been my personal experience. \n\nThe most important part of this story isn’t Hezekiah’s healing, his ultimate death, or the end of his reign. It’s that under the new covenant, we no longer have to question our standing with God, because in Christ Jesus, we have been justified. Jesus died in our place so that, by placing our trust in Him, we could gain eternal life (Romans 6:23). \n\nThe Lord said to Hezekiah, “This is what the LORD God of your ancestor David says: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears,” (2 Kings 20:5). Because of Jesus’s work on the cross, the same God who acknowledges our every sorrow, is now present with us in all things (Psalm 56:8; John 14:15–31). Thanks be to God for all the ways He teaches us about our original sin under the old covenant, so that we may fully know the gift of His Son under the new covenant.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nHas anyone ever told you were were “too much”? I am such a shameless enthusiast that I often quietly remind myself to just calm down. Case in point: a few years ago I needed a juicer. But I couldn’t afford the one I wanted—nay, needed. Luckily I found one on Craigslist. Joy of joys! After exchanging about ten thrilling and delightful messages with the seller, out of the blue he hit me with this: “I am thinking there’s a game going on here. It would be better if you stopped emailing me, because you’re making this too hard. I won’t respond to you any more.”\n\nI blew the deal! All my overly enthusiastic nonsense pushed him away. Yes, it’s possible he wasn’t interested in hearing what I was planning to juice and for whom. Naturally, this wasn’t enough to deter me, so I asked my husband to reach out as a totally unrelated prospective buyer. They easily arranged the sale, and as my husband paid, the juice man confided, “You wouldn’t believe the crazy people I’ve had to deal with on Craigslist over this juicer!” To which my husband shook his head, “Don’t I know it.”\n\nMaybe I should calm down about juicing delicious fruits and vegetables and reserve my zeal for something that truly merits all my energy, but what if there were an appropriate reason to be “too much”? King Josiah would probably not be very popular today; in his day, some might have called him a fanatic. The kings of Judah before him just allowed the country to drift along in the idolatry of their neighbors. What’s more, even the kings that followed him fell back into the same pattern.\n\nBut the words of the Lord were real to Josiah, and he took them seriously. Josiah knew he had fallen deep into the idolatry of the world. The Word of God, like a two-edged sword (Hebrews 4:12), pierced Josiah with conviction and roused in him a zeal that may be foreign to many of us. Consider how fiercely and fervently he repented. If the Lord’s anger burned against it, Josiah was ready to smash it—idols, altars, towers, temples. He brought that same zeal to the whole of his kingdom, destroying every false idol and every false prophet in the land. He was a fanatic, and I think it’s safe to assume that many thought he was “too much.”\n\nBut look at the commendation he received from the Lord: “Before him there was no king like him who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength according to all the law of Moses, and no one like him arose after him” (2 Kings 23:25). Do you see it? He isn’t chided for overbearing zeal or reminded to calm down. Instead, he is lauded for keeping what Christ declared the first and greatest commandment: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength” (Mark 12:30). The first and greatest commandment is the territory of all us. And is this what it means to love the Lord with all your heart, mind, and strength—to give all your energy to the destruction of idols and the defense of God’s words? \n\nWhat if Josiah’s zeal wasn’t too much? What if it was the only right response to the conviction of God’s Word? The first and greatest commandment is the summation of the whole law of God, and it is this very commandment that Christ bids us to keep without wavering. Many of us live without much zeal, and some of us direct our zeal toward things that don’t matter. Instead, we should yield our hearts, all our enthusiasm—our heart, soul, mind, and strength—to the unchanging Word of the Lord. Go ahead and be “too much” for Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nAt the breakfast table this morning, I overheard a four-year-old eagerly explaining the key to getting what he wants: “I just ask, and ask, and ask, and ask until Mama says yes.” Okay, it was my four-year-old. And I usually do give in to him after he has asked seven times. Tired isn’t even the word for how this makes me feel. His simple solution to getting what he wants is actually a really terrible solution. What I want to teach my kids is this: ask, learn, and then obey. Let’s just say that his commitment to setting up his own standard of what is right and wrong is why he still has to take a nap every day.\n\nWe ask God questions all the time. And if we don’t like the answer we get, we ask, and ask, and ask, and ask again. But here’s the thing: God doesn’t get squishy and worn out and depressed about life situations—He is unchanging. So the hilariously pushy methods that sometimes work on parents (and teachers and bosses) don’t change eternal truth. We can’t insist on getting our own way with Him. In a culture that is driven by individualistic self interest, we are lured to believe the opposite—that we can choose what is right.\n\nBut the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). And even though God loved Judah, He sent them into exile and allowed Jerusalem to be destroyed (2 Kings 25:21). These same events are recorded in the book of Jeremiah. As one of the Lord’s prophets, Jeremiah warned Jehoiakim, who warned Jehoiachin, who warned Zedekiah—and he witnessed the judgment God brought against each of these kings. But folly came after folly, and they didn’t listen. \n\n“You have seen all the disaster I brought against Jerusalem…  because of the evil they committed to anger me…  So I sent you all my servants the prophets time and time again, saying,  ‘Don’t commit this detestable action that I hate.’  But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their evil” (Jeremiah 44:2–5).\n\nLike children, we want our own way and don’t want to listen. But we are called to heed God’s ways and His words. Don’t accept a sham when the truth is available to you. We don’t have to pretend to be Christians; we are His children. Jerusalem was on the road to destruction because they refused to listen to the Lord and instead substituted their own truth for the truth of God’s Word. \n\nBut we must be of good hope, because God does generously give us His answers and teach us about His ways and His character through Scripture. Listen today and pay attention. Why push your own truth forward when eternal truth is available to you? Write His words on the tablet of your heart and when you are in need—or busy or scared or overwhelmed or somehow “squishy” and not at your best—they will stay with you (Deuteronomy 11:18).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 1:1-11, Deuteronomy 30:1-5, Deuteronomy 30:11-15, Hebrews 7:25\n\nBack in 2014, when the She Reads Truth community was not quite two years old, Raechel and I felt called to something unexpected and, frankly, a little terrifying. Feeling a kinship to Nehemiah and his call to rebuild the walls of his city to establish a safe place for his people to gather and worship, we believed the Lord laid it on our hearts to build a Bible app with our Shes—a place for them read Truth together, every day. As that app was being built, the community read Nehemiah—some with the very first She Reads Truth study book in hand. \n\nToday, four years later, we are reading Nehemiah together once again. \n\nThe Lord has done remarkable things in this community of Bible-readers in those four years. So many women have opened their Bibles for the first time—or for the first time in a long time—and have kept coming back, day after day. Together, we’ve approached God’s Word again and again as days and weeks have stretched into months and years. And together, we’ve marveled at what we’ve found: God is still faithful, and His Word is still true. \n\nWhen Nehemiah heard that Jerusalem’s walls had been destroyed and her gates burned to the ground, he was devastated. As he wept for his home and his people, he did the one thing he knew to do: he sought the Lord. With prayer and fasting and confession, Nehemiah petitioned the Lord on behalf of Jerusalem. He declared God’s goodness and recalled God’s faithfulness. He spoke the Lord’s promises  back to Him, believing those promises to be true while also petitioning the Lord to act on them. \n\nNehemiah longed for his city to be restored, and we can guess from the gumption we’ll see from him in later chapters that he felt a fire inside to bring about that restoration with his own two hands. But before he put a hand to a hammer, he bowed his knees in prayer. In his humility we see a truth confirmed throughout Scripture: any sense of calling we have, even those directly related to our faith in Christ, rests on the strength, sovereignty, and grace found only in Him. Any good work is God’s work. He invites and equips us to participate in it, which we do by faith in Him, not in ourselves. \n\nAs we read this Old Testament narrative together over the next three weeks, we’ll see how God indeed called Nehemiah to lead the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s wall. But today, as we read this prayer from a broken man for his broken city, may we, too, begin with prayer and confession. Let’s declare God’s goodness and recall His faithfulness. Let’s speak His promises back to Him, knowing that He has both fulfilled them and is fulfilling them right where we are. \n\nMay the Holy Spirit teach us more about God the Father and Christ the Son as we read this book together. And may God give us strength and courage for whatever work He puts before us—both the grand endeavors and the single acts of faithfulness—to the honor and glory of His name.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 2:1-10, Psalm 137:1-9, Hebrews 12:18-24\n\nHave you ever been so worried you couldn’t do your job? You’re supposed to be watercolor painting, but all you can think about is the outcome of your mom’s surgery? Or you’ve tried to be present in a classroom full of third graders, but you can hardly see their faces because all you can think about is the broken heart of your sister? Beyond even these pains, have you ever felt a burning passion that you might be called to something else while you must continue to intone, “Thank you for your purchase, have a nice day”?\n\nI imagine this is how Nehemiah felt as he worked in the service of King Artaxerxes. He had a great job, but while working, he heard really terrible news from Jerusalem: The walls are down! The gates are burned! Our people are living in shame! (Nehemiah 1:3). This news was heartbreaking for him. \n\nThe first thing Nehemiah did was pray. But then he went back to work. For about four months, he showed up to work every day and did his job, not saying a word about his own personal bad news, even though his heart ached. It’s shocking how the world mercilessly grinds forward in spite of our personal griefs. Regardless, sometimes we just have to show up and keep on doing our work.\n\nDuring this time Nehemiah prayed continually and earnestly. And even though he hadn’t breathed a word of his personal anguish to the king, the king saw it written on his face and reached out to him, saying, “Why are you sad?” Nehemiah then confessed his heartbreak, to which the king immediately asked, “What is your request?” (2:2,4).\n\nAnd here is a wonderful moment. The very thing he had longed for—a chance to get exactly what he needed to rebuild Jerusalem—appeared right in front of his nose: a king ready to hear his request, with all the power of the Persian empire in his hands. What did Nehemiah do? Rush in with his five-year plan? Build a case to woo the king’s heart to support his passion project? No. None of that. The first thing Nehemiah did was pray. As my pastor, George Grant, would say, “Instead of running to the throne of the world, [Nehemiah] runs to the throne of the Lord.”\n\nNehemiah was a man committed to prayer. And once he had prayed, he was a man ready for hard work. He asked the king to send him to rebuild the city and a people. By trade, Nehemiah was a white collar palace worker; he attended the king and brought him wine. He wasn’t a city planner, and he didn’t have experience rebuilding walls. But God had called him to rebuild a city, and Nehemiah was a willing worker.\n\nWhether he was working for the king in Persia or rebuilding his homeland in Jerusalem, Nehemiah worked for the Lord. This can be such a difficult and painful thing to do. As the psalmist cries out, “How can we sing the Lord’s song on foreign soil?”(Psalm 137:4). How can we continue to praise the Lord when things are terrible, when everything has gone spectacularly wrong? How can we obey when obedience is the furthest thing from our hearts? By continually turning to the Lord in prayer. \n\nBefore we decide what to do: pray.\n\nBefore we do it: pray.\n\nAfter we begin: pray.\n\nIn this manner, our relationship with God is written on all the hours of our days. May we learn to humble ourselves before Him and submit our requests to Him, instead of bowing to the powers of this world. May our lives become a song of prayer unto the Lord.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 2:11-20, Isaiah 62:8-12, Ephesians 2:19-22, James 2:14-26\n\nAsk any of my friends and they will tell you this: I am terrible at the game of Jenga. It’s the one with wooden blocks stacked tall and intricately as a puzzle of sorts, criss-crossed in a stack that begs to remain unbroken. And yet, that is exactly the point of the game: taking turns slowly choosing just the right block to strategically remove, all while keeping the tower standing and intact. The first few rounds include some easy takeaways, but as the blocks continue to be removed the chances of the tower tumbling increase. And trust me, you do not want to be the one choosing the wrong block, causing the tumble, and ending the game. \n\nMany days, it feels as if tragedy is looming and pain is just around the corner. Afraid, we don’t want to be the one to make our joys tumble into sadness, or witness our hopes disintegrating into ruin. No one wants to fall.\n\nJerusalem’s wall fell. Torn down and destroyed by fire, the walls and gates surrounding Nehemiah’s beloved city whispered a disgraceful story of shame and abandonment. Like standing beside a spilled tower of blocks, Jerusalem was filled with nothing but past memories and lost hopes. That is, until Nehemiah showed up with plans only God could have laid on His heart: \n\n“You see the trouble we are in. Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been burned. Come, let’s rebuild Jerusalem’s wall, so that we will no longer be a disgrace” (Nehemiah 2:17).\n\nWhile we fear destruction and are anticipating all the ways we could mess things up, God has already planned restoration. Where we stand in ruin, He sees new creation. \n\nUnfortunately, I have a hard time remembering this truth when I’m in the midst of painful circumstances. And every time I choose the wrong Jenga block, so to speak, I vow to never play again, wondering what I could have done differently to avoid pain. The thought that doesn’t cross my mind so easily is this: rebuild. I don’t see the point in stacking the blocks up again, only to fall once more.\n\nBut rebuilding is not an afterthought to God. Restoration and redemption are His priority. By God’s mercy, He allows our eyes to see glimpses of the restoration plan and invites our hands and hearts into the work. Nehemiah trusted in the good work God was doing through him, even when he could not yet envision the final product. He knew the God of the heavens would grant them success (v.20).\n\nA new wall for Jerusalem meant much more than one more round of Jenga. The rebuilt walls protected a temple, creating a safe and sacred space for worship. In the same way, our God is always building us up to know and adore Him more. This is true restoration. Thanks be to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "We Began Rebuilding the Walls",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 3:1-32, Romans 12:3-8, Psalm 8:1\n\nSummer 2017 was a doozy for hurricanes. We could hardly flip on the television or open Twitter without seeing brutal images of destruction, people desperate for power and food, and endless press conferences from emergency officials. In Houston and Florida and Puerto Rico—the storms came in vicious waves.\n\nWhen the storms stopped, aid rushed in from all corners. The money came from donors big and small, celebrities and ordinary people alike. Houston Texans defensive end JJ Watt raised millions of dollars for recovery in Houston. Celebrity chef José Andrés and his non-profit cooked more than three million meals for people without power in Puerto Rico. Alongside many of his famous friends, Lin-Manuel Miranda—creator and star of the Broadway musical Hamilton—recorded a song for Puerto Rico and dedicated the profits to relief efforts.\n\nHouston and Puerto Rico are still recovering, and it will take decades to rebuild them both. I don’t want to assume the efforts of these varied groups of people allow us to tie these devastating events up with a pretty bow, or draw moralistic and clichéd conclusions about how disasters bring people together. These aren’t joyful barn raisings; they are the direct result of tragedy.\n\nWe see the same in the book of Nehemiah. Jerusalem was burned and pillaged by the Babylonians. God’s people had repeatedly turned away from Him, and they were displaced, their homes destroyed. But when the time came to return and rebuild, a diverse group of people banded together to do the work.\n\nIn Nehemiah 3, the author records at least 43 distinct groups or named persons who rebuilt the gates and the walls around Jerusalem. They were all types of people: the high priest Eliashib (v.1); the Tekoites (v.5); the daughters of Shallum, who was the son of the ruler of half of Jerusalem (v.12); Hashabiah, who was the ruler of his own district (v.17); temple servants (v.26); goldsmiths and merchants (v.31).\n\nThey were rulers and servants, men and women, tradesmen and priests. The work knew no distinction between rich and poor, the same way the tragedy of the exile touched every person in Israel and Judah. Tragedies flatten. They knock down walls and homes indiscriminately, across class, race, gender, and age. And when it comes time to rebuild, the work falls on everyone as well.\n\nNehemiah 3 is a story, not just a list of who did what while rebuilding the gates. It’s a story of a broken people finding their way home again, and then laying aside titles, traditional roles, and expectations to build the walls around their city. Not unlike the body of Christ the apostle Paul describes in Romans 12, those who rebuilt Jerusalem’s walls worked as one body with many parts (v.4).\n\nAnd while Nehemiah 3 isn’t really our story, one of the beautiful gifts of the gospel is that it is for everyone. We are all flattened by sin, by the tragedy of the fall. But rather than each of us doing the hard, back-breaking work of redeeming and rebuilding our own hearts, our story has a different ending. No matter how hard we work, whether individually or together, we cannot fix sin. Instead, we all have to rely on the power and work of one person alone: Jesus Christ. \n\n Thanks be to God!\n\n",

    "devo_title": "We Kept Rebuilding in Spite of Opposition",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 4:1-23, Genesis 28:15, Ephesians 1:18-23\n\nIn my second year of college, I flunked out. Well, maybe not “flunked out,” but I was definitely placed on academic probation. I couldn’t take classes at the university for a full year. Humiliated and miserable, I returned home to wait out my year off. I took that year very seriously. With the help of a coach, I learned the value of delayed gratification and self-governance. It was the hardest work I’d ever undertaken, and that hard work paid off when I returned and graduated.\n\nA few years later, I decided I wanted to get healthy. Eating well and exercising were more challenging than I’d expected, and there were several times I wanted to give up. But each time I felt overwhelmed, I remembered the hard work of teaching myself to self-govern and to delay immediate gratification, and how those skills had earned me a diploma. Remembering these things spurred me on toward health. \n\nIn Scripture, the command to “remember” certain things is common. The Israelites were instructed to remember God delivered them from slavery in Egypt (Exodus 13:3), and they were charged with committing the law to their memory (34:27). Similarly, the New Testament church was instructed to remember the victorious work of Christ on the cross through observing holy communion (Luke 22:7-19). It seems that “remembering” is the bridge that connects the past to the future—a present action that recalls the past and serves to propel us into our future. \n\nThe author of Nehemiah is recounting an experience during the rebuilding of the wall, when the circumstances of the present seem to be overwhelming the promise of the future. External forces were devising a plan to obstruct the building of Jerusalem’s walls. The opposition first tried to plant seeds of doubt. They hurled taunts and ridicule as the Jews were beginning their work, yet the Jewish builders persisted. But when they were about halfway through, the naysayers decided to destroy the work. \n\nUnderstandably, the prospect of battle put fear in the hearts of the Jews who were working, and they began to doubt. Nehemiah assessed the danger and found that it was indeed very real. And so he told the workers to outfit themselves with the accoutrements of battle, and he directed them to “remember the great and awe-inspiring God” (Nehemiah 4:14). \n\nAnd remember they did. They remembered the battles previously fought and won with Jehovah as their commander-in-chief, and they prepared to fight to protect their wives, their children, and the future of their holy city, Jerusalem. The remembering brought them strength—not just strength to arm themselves, but strength to continue the work. \n\nToday, I’m encouraged to continue the work God has called me to, remembering His faithfulness in my past. The opposition of my present circumstances might be a very real threat—funky finances, a broken relationship, systemic injustice—but today I choose to remember the character and promises of the God I serve. \n\n“Look, I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go. I will bring you back to this land,\n\nfor I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”\n— Genesis 28:15\n\n",

I want and weigh and debate and discuss until finally I buy at full price. There is one place, though, where I have no problem hunting for bargains: my standing before God. \n\nIt seems I’m always being measured and measuring myself up against the standards of others, and therefore, against the standard of God. Unconsciously, I list my good deeds against my less than good deeds and, finding myself short, try to make it up to God. \n\nI’ll be more faithful here.\nI’ll give more of myself there.\nI’ll be a better friend here.\nA better wife there.\nI’ll be quick to say I’m sorry here.\nAnd I’ll be slow to take offense there.\nSurely the scales will be weighed and I’ll not be found wanting?\nSurely my generosity must count for something?\n\nWhat I love about Nehemiah chapter 5 is that while Nehemiah is a man who is known and loved by God and loves Him in return, somehow he still feels the need to present his list of good deeds before God. It’s as if he is a small child who’s come in from a long day of playing outside to then dump out the contents of his pockets and present them as treasures before his father.\n\nI found this rock and this stick.\nLook at this leaf and this frog.\nI played with this boy and then we built this fort.\nCome see it…\n\nAnd instead of ignoring or rebuking the child for distracting him, the father delights in the boy’s account. This child is not earning the love of his father; he is simply overflowing with the gift of who and what he is—a child, about the work of being a child, doing the things a child does, and certain in the love of his father.\n\nIt is not a bargain Nehemiah is on the hunt for here. He’s not listing his deeds to God in order to gain His approval. He knows who he is and what he is called to do: rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and call the people to repentance. It is not scales on which Nehemiah lays the goodness of his deeds—it is for the delight of his Father. \n\nWe know that as children of God, our “good deeds” are like filthy rags before the goodness of Christ (Isaiah 64:6). We are fully covered in the sacrifice of Christ’s death; therefore, we can no more justify our good deeds or count our bad ones against us. Jesus’ work on the cross is complete, as is our justification through Him (Galatians 2:16).\n\nSo since we are children of God, as we go about our lives today, let’s not tally mark our good deeds or our  bad ones, but instead be about our Father’s business, being faithful with what He has called us to today. And at the end of the day, whether we’re tempted to feel self-sufficient and justified or ashamed and unworthy, based on what we did or did not accomplish—let us instead empty our hearts before the Father and show Him the treasures of a life lived in faithfulness for our joy and His glory.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 6:1-19, Isaiah 9:6-7, Jeremiah 23:5-6\n\nWhether it’s creeping doubts or, in the case of Nehemiah, a determined band of enemies with names like Sanballat (boo!), the work that Christ has for us rarely goes unopposed. \n\nAs I consider the ways God has used His Word to call me to serve and go and share, I am bolstered by Nehemiah’s tenacious faithfulness. Though his opponents sought to distract and discourage him, Nehemiah stood firm. His eyes were on the prize. His mission was God’s glory. His feet were firmly planted in the idea that he was building something bigger than himself. When his enemies accused him of plotting a coup to take the throne, Nehemiah simply sent this message:\n\n“I am doing a great work and I cannot come down” (Nehemiah 6:3). \n\nHis words have the power to equip and encourage us. As we minister, as we obey, as we ask God to shape us into the image-bearers we were made to become, the voice of the enemy will continuously ring in our ears. But we do not have to listen. Christ is doing an important work in us, after all. There’s more to see. Nehemiah is pointing us toward something bigger. \n\nFast forward nearly 500 years past the construction of Nehemiah’s wall. Jesus, our Savior, hangs on a cross. Just like Nehemiah, Christ’s enemies accused Him of vying for a human throne. A sign carved by hatred was placed above His head, declaring sarcastically, “This is Jesus, King of the Jews” (Matthew 27:37). Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and the rest stood at the base of Nehemiah’s wall and hurled insults. \n\nChrist’s accusers stood at the base of the cross and did the same. \n\n“He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him” (Matthew 27:42). \n\nJesus didn’t flinch. He didn’t rush to His own defense. He didn’t climb off the cross and put His opponents in their place, though He certainly could have. His eyes were glued to the Father, and His mission was our salvation. With His actions Christ was, in essence, declaring, “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down.”\n\nNehemiah rebuilt the temple walls, and Jesus rebuilt the temple. Nehemiah stayed the course until the wall was finished, and Jesus stayed on the cross until the veil was torn. Nehemiah couldn’t have known it, but he was declaring the gospel with his life and work. Because Jesus was not deterred by His accusers, we can declare the same.\n\nI reckon Nehemiah would tell us there is no cost to count when compared to the privilege of pointing to Jesus. And through His death, Jesus declares there is no cost too high to pay in order to ransom us. With the gospel as our grid, we can stay the course, embracing Christ’s words as He reminds us, \n\n“If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.\n\nFor whoever wants to save his life will lose it,\nbut whoever loses his life because of me will save it” (Luke 9:23-24).\n\nPick up your cross. Tune out the enemy. Let’s keep building.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 7:1-73, Exodus 28:29-30, Psalm 34:19-22\n\nYES! Genealogies!! Who needs stories when you can just cozy up with a good list of who begat whom, am I right? I bet you love them just a little bit too. I mean, who hasn’t gotten the chills from the genealogy at the end of Ruth, when you realize she fits right into the line of Judah and became the great grandmother of King David? That list prompts the realization that God had a plan for our sweet Ruth all along. Genealogies show us God’s sovereign plan for our salvation and His intimate love for individual people.\n\nWhen Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem, he needed to do more than stack bricks and hang gates; he needed to rebuild a people. These people were born into exile. They had never actually seen Jerusalem. They’d only heard stories about it. All they knew was life without a home, without traditions, and without community. They had nothing. So as Nehemiah began to rebuild Jerusalem, he also had to learn how to rebuild a people. And each one of those people mattered. \n\nThis genealogy in Nehemiah chapter 7 is a list of the Israelites released by Cyrus from exile in 538 BC. It’s a wonderfully meticulous list that even includes the number of mules that moved back to the city (there were 245). More importantly, it tells us a lot about who these people were, and how much people matter to God. In verse 7, twelve leaders are listed, and those twelve are representatives of the twelve tribes—showing us that they’re not just a part of the covenant, but are once again whole and entitled to the full blessings of God’s covenant promises.\n\nEach family’s descendants are also counted. Some families were massive (Senaah had 3,930 descendants!), and some families’ reunions were more modest (Beth Azmaveth had only 42). Regardless of how large or small, they were counted as families and not all heaped together, because individuals and families matter to God.\n\nPriests, Levites, musicians, and gatekeepers were also counted, indicating that our callings matter to God. Temple servants are listed using their foreign names because they were not Hebrew-born, having joined with Israel through conversion to their God. Because God redeems the lives of His servants (Psalm 34:22), He makes them equal inheritors of the covenant with those who could trace their lineage all the way back to Abraham.\n\nAnd finally, there were some who searched the records but were unable to discover their heritage because their families had been so torn apart by the exile. These, too, are listed, and their value is not diminished. Children born into captivity are valued just the same, regardless of their parentage.\n\nFrom there, the people settled back into their towns and began to knit their lives together. That’s as close as we get to “happily every after” in the book of Nehemiah. But in reading this book, we see that God’s eye is always on His people, restoring not just a broken city, but a broken people as well. He cares about each one of us, our families, our homes, and our lives. And if we are in Christ, we are co-inheritors of His covenant blessings just as much as any son of Abraham. \n\n",

The day something just clicked? You knew the words of it one day, but in that one moment you understood the absolute truth of it. For me one of those “Aha!” moments happened when I came to understand the Bible wasn’t primarily a book about me, but rather a book about God. \n\nThat may seem silly to some. It may be something every Sunday School kid armed with The Jesus Storybook Bible already knows. But for me, as a 30-year-old woman, it was astounding to realize that my entire life I had read the Bible one way, when it was intended to be read an entirely different way. It changed everything for me. It made the gospel come alive to me. It made Scripture come alive to me. It made Jesus come alive to me. \n\nBut it also made my sin more real to me. \n\nI was rejoicing because this book held the words of life, but I was weeping because this book also showed me my sin. It wasn’t just a book about how if I did good things, good things would happen in return for me. It wasn’t just a book of stories about that “nice man” Jesus. It wasn’t a book that held the key to getting an eternity with God. It was a whole book that had to be believed in its entirety—even the really hard bits.\n\nI imagine this is how the Israelites felt when the book of the law was read to them. The weightiness of all the ways they couldn’t measure up were read clearly to them so the people could understand it fully. And as we would expect, they wanted to mourn and weep, because who could keep a law like this one? But look what Nehemiah says to them—and to us, who still sometimes buckle under the weight of a law fulfilled: \n\n“Do not grieve, because the joy of the Lord is your strength” (Nehemiah 8:10).\n\nThe same strength given to those who did not yet have full understanding of God’s redemptive plan is given to us today when we understand the full weight of Scripture, our sin, and the Savior’s sacrifice. The joy of the Lord is our strength when under the weight of conviction and in the midst of mourning our sin. \n\nThe joy of the Lord, the goodness of His sovereign plan and His deep love, His careful attention and His unmerited mercy—these are why we can rejoice in the face of what seems terribly, terribly hard, irrevocably broken, or unattainably high. We can trust in the joy of the Lord.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 9:1-37, 2 Corinthians 1:20-22\n\nThe last thing you want after a long week away is a bad ride home from the airport. But that’s where I found myself last week, hailing an Uber ride from the arrivals entrance. A frequent traveler, I typically enjoy these modern-day “cabs.” The driver who came to pick me up late that night was kind and hospitable, hoisting my luggage into the trunk and respecting my lack of desire to make small talk. Like I said, it had been a long week, and I was grateful for the relative quiet.\n\nMy ride home from the airport should have been simple—one I could probably drive with my eyes closed. That’s why I noticed the two U-turns, the missed stop sign, the turnaround in a grocery store parking lot, and the driver who became increasingly silent. Maybe I should have spoken up sooner, but when I finally asked, “Where are we?” it was because I already knew the answer: we were lost. Very, very lost. The driver had missed the intended destination entirely. \n\nThe word “sin” comes from the idea of failure, “the act or state of missing the mark.” I confess that every time I sin, I am acting out of my humanity and turning my heart away from my Father. I turn away from the intended place He has created for me: living in His presence and in relationship with Him. In day-to-day life sin can become much more than just my actions; it can begin to feel more like my permanent residence. \n\nLike the embarrassed apology my driver made when we finally made it home, returning to the reality of my sin always makes me feel ashamed. But in Nehemiah 9, we have an opportunity to reframe this together, watching as the children of Israel gather together to confess their sin. However, instead of being driven by guilt, they are empowered by celebration. Just days after the feast of the tabernacles, one of the most joyful parties they’d ever had, they paused to realign their hearts with God’s—not because they were hurt or afraid, but because they were thankful.\n\nIt is a grace that God “[acts] faithfully, while we have acted wickedly” (Nehemiah 9:33). It is a gift that He keeps covenants, even when we do not. At the intersection of our lack and His goodness, may we return to Him, remembering and cherishing what it is to be considered His. All promises are “yes” in the Savior who calls His wandering children home, again and again (2 Corinthians 1:20).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 9:38, Nehemiah 10:1-39, John 14:15, Hebrews 4:15\n\nFind me managing a tantrum in the middle of the bread aisle and I might sing a different tune, but I want more from my children than blind obedience. I don’t want them to toe the line based strictly on fear of consequences. Our home is not a police state, after all. I want my children’s obedience to reflect the condition of their hearts, for their actions to be a response to the love and care they’ve been given. \n\nAs I consider my role in the family of God, I know the Father wants the same from me. As an unbeliever, I couldn’t work up the oomph to care much about what God said about how I should live. At best, He seemed like an aloof father figure, and at worst, an unreasonable tyrant. Like a toddler determined to have her own way, I rebelled. \n\nAs a new believer, I swung the pendulum of obedience to extremes. I wanted to obey all the rules, do all the right things, avoid all the wrong ones. I saw God as a hyper-attentive helicopter parent. I lived in constant fear of disappointing Him. But I’ve been walking with Christ for twenty years now, and a beautiful shift has transpired. Much like what happened with my earthly parents as I hit my mid-twenties, I want to please God—not because of fear of consequences, but because He is so clearly worthy of my unequivocal devotion and respect. Rather than being motivated by fear, my obedience has become the way I say “thank you” for all He has done for me. \n\nHere, in Nehemiah 9-10, we see God’s people growing up, maturing. They’ve been through a rebellious phase, and it has cost them dearly. In the eras preceding Nehemiah’s day, God’s people saw Him as an oppressive and unreasonable Father, and their warped view of Him fueled generations of rebellion. But because He is a loving Father, He graciously gathered them together again. He reminded them of His expectations and gave them another chance to get it right. They looked around at their scattered tribes, their rubbled city, their fallen comrades, and their perspective shifted. \n\nGod is good.\n\nHis ways are best.\n\nRebellion leads to destruction.\n\nFor all of chapter 10, God’s children declared what they would and would not do in response to God’s love. We’ve heard it all before, but the tone is different here. Just like the children I tuck into bed every night, they would not obey perfectly, but their hearts had changed. For the first time in a long time, they wanted to obey their Father. In all things, they were determined to “not neglect the house of God” (Nehemiah 10:39).\n\nLove and obedience are tied together with a sacred cord. That’s why Christ cut to the chase with these words: “If you love me, you will keep my commands” (John 14:15). Author Paul David Tripp puts it this way: “Obedience is not what gets you grace. It’s the evidence that grace has gotten you.” Belief leads to obedience, because when we see who God really is, we want to live like He asks us to. It is our loving response to the God who is Love.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "We Resettled Jerusalem",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 11:1-21, Deuteronomy 7:9, Hebrews 11:13-16\n\nTwo summers ago, one of my best friends went to Greece. He didn’t go to see the Acropolis or the Parthenon, or to eat feta and olives by the handful. Instead, he spent several months on the island of Lesbos tending to thousands of refugees who had flooded there from war-ravaged Syria.\n\nHe sent pictures of little children, of lines of people waiting for blankets and clothes, of tents, of towers made of life jackets used to keep people afloat after their lifeboats sank. And he sent one picture of a fence post with these words scribbled across it, a holy graffiti: On earth as it is in heaven.\n\nEvery text, every story, every picture made me catch my breath and whisper a prayer. If you search online for his camp, you see headlines with words like “trapped” and “welcome to prison,” “horrific” and “languishing.” A few months after he left, his camp burned to ground. Tears flow as I write this, just thinking about it.\n\nThe people of God were hardly strangers to displacement. I hesitate to pull a direct parallel to the refugees from Syria, because in reading Nehemiah 11 we see a cautious return to their forsaken home. The Syrian refugees haven’t had that yet (and may not), and it feels odd to use them as an illustration here without being able to do something to ease the tragedy of their situation. But I believe we have to sit in that together, and feel the unease and discomfort.\n\nWe know that God’s people felt the pain of being dispersed during the exile. They were torn apart from their families, and they watched their cities burn. But now, at the end of Nehemiah, Jerusalem was ready. The walls were strong again. And yet, the people didn’t come willingly.\n\nNehemiah 11:1-2 tells us that they had to cast lots to decide who had to live in Jerusalem. They blessed the people who volunteered to live there. Why? Because Jerusalem would be the target of all of Israel’s enemies. John Wesley described the situation so poetically in his commentary on Nehemiah, saying, “This city was the butt of all the malicious plots of their enemies.” The return to David’s holy city wasn’t marked by a parade, by triumphant singing, or by celebration. It was marked by trepidation, a slow and careful entrance into the city that God had given them once again.\n\nI can imagine the Israelites were tired, limping across a finish line that still didn’t seem ideal. They were home, but they still had only the Lord to keep them safe. They knew the walls of Jerusalem had been burned once, and they could be burned again.\n\nLike the Israelites, we are still seeking a safe haven, a homeland. We, too, serve a God who is preparing a city for us—a heavenly city, where there will be no need for walls to protect us because we will dwell with God in perfect peace forever (Hebrews 11:16).\n\nThese promises from God remind me of the hymn “Guide Me O Thou Great Jehovah.” It is the mournful cry of a pilgrim people who know that one day, we will be home.\n\nWhen I tread the verge of Jordan,\nbid my anxious fears subside.\nDeath of death, and hell’s destruction,\nLand me safe on Canaan’s side.\n…\nLand me safe on Canaan’s side,\nbid my anxious fears,\nbid my anxious fears goodbye.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 11:22-36, Nehemiah 12:1-26, Isaiah 48:1-11, Philippians 3:18-20\n\nAs a child in elementary school, I was always scared to read aloud in class. It wasn’t because I was a bad reader. In fact, I always read a bit faster than everyone else, skipping ahead to read a paragraph or two before the rest of the class. But even still, I was constantly nervous I would say something wrong or lose my place in the reading, and as a result, make a fool of myself if called on by the teacher. \n\nIt’s easy to get lost in this passage from Nehemiah 11 and 12, because it’s full of the names of people and places that are hard to read and even harder to pronounce. It’s also easy to acknowledge that there are a lot of names, decide they’re too difficult to pronounce, and then skip ahead to the more interesting part of the story. \n\nBut names are important. The names in this passage are the names of the priests who came back to live in Jerusalem. At the time, Jerusalem wasn’t exactly the hip, new place to live. It was dangerous to the point that the people had to cast lots to see who would go back and build their lives there. The names of these priests listed in Nehemiah 11 and 12 are the priests who took the risk, voluntarily or not, because the people moving to Jerusalem needed priests too. \n\nThese lists tell us more than just who these people were; they tell us where they came from, their history. There is a lot of interest nowadays in finding out more about your ancestry. You send in a sample of your DNA, and some laboratory sends you back a full report of your global ancestry. Human nature leans toward wanting more knowledge, more information, which is probably why these kinds of tests have become so popular. We just want to know what we want to know. \n\nThese lists of priests serve a similar purpose: to help future generations of priests know where they came from. When we know where we come from, it’s easier to know what we’re moving toward, to take a glimpse at the bigger picture. But our full understanding of where we come from lies in the knowledge and belief of this truth: our citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20). \n\nOur most important family name is the one given to us as children of God. We are His sons and daughters, and He is our Father. We belong to Him. He is our ancestry. He is our past, present, and future. Our citizenship and our family name rests fully with Him, and Him alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 12:27-47, Hebrews 13:15, Revelation 19:1-8\n\nI love parties. Love them. Any excuse to celebrate is good enough for me. New baby, new job, new spouse, new house, renovated house, new car, reupholstered car, birthday, anniversary, church holiday, national holiday—doesn’t matter. I’m here for the celebration. There’s something special about gathering with a group of people for a purpose that isn’t work-related, where the only objective is to have a great time. I have to admit, I’ve walked past a group of strangers having a party at a restaurant and secretly wished I could take part in their merry-making. \n\nIn reading today’s passage, I was happy to see I’m not the only one who likes to have a good time. When the wall was completed and the time came to dedicate the fruit of their labor to the Lord, the Jews held nothing back—and they were well within their rights! “On that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy” (Nehemiah 12:43). \n\nThe wall had been rebuilt despite external threats and internal fatigue. And chile, if those folks didn’t rejoice! There were choirs and cymbals and harps and singers rocking the house with their jubilant praise. The people sang and offered sacrifices to God with great joy—praise that was heard far and wide.\n\nIt’s a sincere prayer of mine today that I would learn to look on achievements, victories, and answered prayers with that same exuberance. I don’t want to look back on an answered prayer and think, Welp! I’m glad that’s over with! and quickly rush on to other matters. I want to see every triumph for what it is: a victory won by my great and glorious God. I want to take time to honor God by celebrating His works and plans and victories well.\n\nAnd Scripture tells us the Jewish people did just that, rejoicing like wild over a wall. They lifted a resounding praise that neighboring cities could hear because of a wall. To those other cities and nations, rebuilding a wall might have been an insignificant accomplishment, maybe something to jot down in a history book for posterity’s sake, but nothing major. But for the people of God, the rebuilding of the wall meant something. \n\nIt meant increased protection from enemies who would try to conquer Jerusalem.\n\nIt meant that their God hadn’t forsaken them, even though they’d sinned against Him.\n\nIt meant that He still dwelt in their holy city and would continue to fight for them.\n\nI’m assuming that, after years in exile, that kind of knowledge was life-giving and joy-fueling for God’s people. I imagine it continued to bring them joy as they remembered it years later. This passage makes me want to do the same, to consider and reconsider God’s hand in my life, to look again and again for His goodness and power at work on my behalf. It also makes me want to learn how to celebrate—really celebrate—those victories, achievements, and even (seemingly) unanswered prayers in such a way that my joy can be heard far and wide.  \n\nBecause if my joy can be seen or heard coming from a mile away, my neighbors and friends will start to wonder, What’s she so happy about? Which may just lead to, How can I have the kind of joy she has? And when asked, I can confidently point them to the great and glorious God who gives me the victory in Him, again and again and again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 13:1-31, John 14:2-3\n\nThe Tower of London was built around the year 1000 AD, and it still stands on the banks of the Thames River today. But a castle that old needs tending to keep looking good, no matter how many famous ravens live there. The regular maintenance is never finished, and every task, once complete, needs to be done again every 75 years. The old castle is never really “finished.” It’s just going through its stages of the 75-year upkeep plan.\n\nWhen Nehemiah returns to Jerusalem, the walls are still standing, but the people have fallen apart. They have forgotten who they are and what God has called them to do. It’s so discouraging after the celebration and commemoration ceremonies in the previous chapters. We all want a happy ending for these people who worked so hard and endured so much.\n\nOn this side of heaven, things will never be perfect. Because of the curse of sin, we will always struggle. But there are three things I think we can learn about the gospel from this passage.\n\nFirst, notice what Nehemiah does before he lets his righteous anger fly. He gathers the whole community and reads the book of Moses. I think it’s safe to say that he read the Pentateuch—at the very least, the Ten Commandments, and at the most, he sat them down for hours and read the whole thing. Either way, before He brings them to justice for breaking God’s law, he reminds them of God’s law. He establishes their common ground. When we are struggling, we must return to God’s Word to remember who we are and to whom we belong.\n\nSecond, remember that Nehemiah is a man of prayer. He prayed before he even answered the king. He is a steady and continuous man of prayer. While he brings judgment to the people, he keeps stopping to pray. He cries out: “Remember me for this, my God, and don’t erase the deeds of faithful love I have done for the house of my God and for its services… look on me with compassion according to the abundance of your faithful love” (Nehemiah 13:14, 22). It’s clear that prayer is an integral part of Nehemiah’s actions. When we find that we are inadequate, when things have gone wrong, we must turn to God in prayer.\n\nFinally, let’s notice that even Nehemiah, the guy who is known for prayer and Scripture reading, couldn’t get it perfectly right. He was a great leader and a true man of God, but he still wasn’t able to create a perfect city. He couldn’t totally stamp out corruption. He couldn’t get people to follow the rules. The people fell into the same sins that sent them into exile in the first place, and Nehemiah couldn’t fix them.\n\nChrist is the only One who can complete the work. He changes hearts, He mends families, and He is making all things new. We are called to read His Word, submit ourselves to prayer, and realize that no matter how dedicated or good we think we are at self-maintenance, we cannot achieve a perfect utopia. We can barely keep the Tower of London from falling down! So we ought to do the work He has called to do, and rest in Christ who is the only One who can truly call a task finished.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 1:1-22, Psalm 32:7, Daniel 6:8, Daniel 6:13-18\n\nThere’s an old saying that goes, “When God closes a door, He opens a window.” Perhaps you’ve heard it? But God’s work in the lives of His people is far more magnificent than that. \n\nEven better than closing doors and opening windows, what we find in the book of Esther is the active, invisible, and preemptive hand of God at work in the most unexpected places. \n\nToday’s reading sets the stage by casting an ominous shadow over a seemingly happy time of feasting and abundance. The king throws a party meant to last for 180 days, but when he summons his queen so that he might show off her beauty to his guests, she refuses to come to him. This decision has repercussions that will reverberate throughout the kingdom, kicking the rest of the story into motion. \n\nReaders respond in different ways to this conflict between the king and queen. How are we to view her defiance? How should we measure his reaction? But whether we interpret Vashti’s actions as brave or bad, the larger truth of this book remains unchanged. This story is about God and His providential care for His chosen people in exile. In the book of Esther and throughout all of Scripture, God is the main character of every story. \n\nThough His name is not directly mentioned, God’s presence is evident in this Old Testament book. And His sovereignty and goodness are not dependent upon our reactions and interpretations. When faced with an unexpected turn of events or unwelcome challenge, most of us turn to scheming and problem solving, trying to figure things out and then “fix” them as we see fit. But the book of Esther shows us that God does not go around simply reacting to whatever we throw at Him. He doesn’t work that way. No, He acts first. His rescue plans are already in place—even before danger comes our way.  \n\nGod’s involvement in our lives is so much better than closed doors and open windows. In the story of Esther, and in our story of salvation, God designs our deliverance even before man begins to devise our destruction.\n\nThe book of Esther is short, rich, and ultimately points to Christ overcoming death by giving His own life—a ransom for us all. As you read, look for the active, invisible, preemptive hand of God. Consider the ways God has designed your own deliverance, and imagine the invisible ways He is caring for you even now. \n\nGod is good. And He is at work.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 2, Proverbs 31:10-31\n\nWell, I have to admit; the circumstances of Esther’s appointment as queen are a bit… gritty. \n\nI wish I could say that everything in the book of Esther is beautiful because it’s in the Bible. But the truth is, the Old Testament is filled with the stories of ordinary people who make extraordinarily bad choices. Yes, “All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching” (2 Timothy 3:16), but clearly, we aren’t meant to emulate the idol-loving Jezebel, the jealousy of Joseph’s brothers, or the murderous Cain. \n\nIt’s not Esther I take issue with; it’s her circumstances. I can’t help but read her story and feel a little disturbed by the idea of a young woman kept in a harem. It’s creepy to imagine a king trying out different women until he picks his favorite. And it sure seems like Esther was beloved largely because of her looks (Esther 2:15). I suppose that makes her sound eerily similar to a contestant on some reality television show. It makes for an entertaining show, but it’s surely not showcasing the most life-giving way to date in real life.\n\nSo then, what can we learn from Esther’s appointment as queen?\n\nFirst of all, it is good to remember that God works through imperfect circumstances. I don’t know about you, but that’s a huge relief to me. Contrary to the gospel of social media, we don’t need to have perfect lives for God to move in our lives. Esther was a persecuted orphan girl living in a brothel, but the Lord used her to save His people in a big way. \n\nThe heart of the Father is to bring beauty from ashes (Isaiah 61:3). This is demonstrated in His redeeming work again and again, through the imperfect circumstances of Scripture’s heroes and heroines. Esther is a godly woman who’s called to act in a precarious situation. What you might notice is that Esther took the wise counsel of those she trusted, keeping her ethnicity a secret until the right time as Mordecai advised, and adorning herself as the king’s eunuch instructed. \n\nSure, Esther could have been prideful, determining she ultimately knew best. She could have blurted out her secret and chosen her own fashion statements. But had she gone that route, it might have changed the king’s reaction and the entire story. \n\nSo was Esther passive or humble? Weak or wise?\n\nWhile the circumstances surrounding Esther’s story may raise a few eyebrows in today’s culture, the woman herself seems to be an admirable and fierce role model. Esther knew that “charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting,” but the wisdom found in learning to fear the Lord does not fade (Proverbs 31:30). Out of wisdom and humility, she sought the help she needed. And through that counsel, God gave her the courage to walk into a life-threatening situation on behalf of His people.\n\nEsther trusted in her God and in His perfect will. Through her story, we are reminded that our pasts are never too crooked, our circumstances never too disappointing, to take part in the world-changing work of our heavenly Father.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 3:1-15, Psalm 68:20, Proverbs 16:33\n\nAt times, my life can feel like one of those “Choose Your Own Adventure” books I used to read back in the fourth grade. I find myself at a fork in the road, worrying that if I make the wrong choice the plot will be ruined, the protagonist (i.e. me) won’t be rescued, and my story won’t ever be worth reading. \n\nBut the Bible is a different kind of book. God’s Word is uniquely able to lift my eyes off of the decisions that paralyze me, and instead refocus them on the “author and perfecter” of my story, and of your story, too—of the bigger story that has already been written (Hebrews 12:2). \n\nHere in the book of Esther, the storyline of God’s people takes a desperate turn. Fueled by ego, power, and a desire for revenge, Haman is “filled with fury” (Esther 3:5) and plots the genocide of the Jews. He’d already decided to destroy the Jews, but he waited to show his hand until the “signs”—the casting of lots (v.7)—seemed to confirm that this was more than vindication, that it was a divine assignment. \n\nCasting lots looked much like rolling a pair of dice, and was often used as a way of seeking divine guidance. Joshua cast lots to divide up the promised land among the tribes of Israel (Joshua 18:6). The apostles cast lots to find Judas’s replacement (Acts 1:26). Here, King Ahasuerus’s officials cast lots in his court, and Haman tasks himself with interpreting them. \n\nOn the day Haman chose to move forward, an edict of death was signed and delivered throughout the land, seemingly sealing the doom of God’s people. But their story isn’t determined by a single decision or a lone madman. Our lives are not a Choose Your Own Adventure book where we sink or swim, survive or die, based solely on our ability to make the right choice. \n\nGod’s people would be spared, not because they did everything right and Haman did everything wrong. The edict of death would be repealed, not because Haman didn’t have the power to enforce it—he did—but because there is a stronger hand writing the story. \n\nThere is no rolling the dice with the sovereignty of God. “The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD” (Proverbs 16:33). His plans cannot be thwarted. His story cannot be edited. His people cannot be ripped from His loving hand. \n\nThe story God writes in Esther ultimately points to Jesus. Again, wicked rulers, high on power and poisoned by jealousy, sought to destroy God’s Chosen. Again, the government officials issued decrees that seemed to seal a deal with darkness. Only this time, the edict was not repealed. Christ was killed for our benefit. And once again, the lots were cast: \n\nAnd they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take (Mark 15:24). \n\nGod is sovereign, capable of having His way in our lives and in our history books. While Roman soldiers cast lots to divide up Jesus’ bloody robe, He was already at work making all things new. No man can stop Him. No plot can take Him out. In His sovereignty, He rescued the Jews from Haman’s hatred, just as He rescued us from our sin. Truly, “Our God is a God of salvation” (Psalm 68:20).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 4:1-17, Isaiah 15:1-3, Romans 5:6-11\n\nRachel is a scourge to the devil in Vienna.\n\nEvery time I saw her she was flushed with excitement over a recent chance to share the gospel. Any encounter on the subway, any phone call, and every relationship irresistibly impelled her to tell people the good news. Although she was a gifted linguist with a degree from Cambridge, she carried Bible tracts in her pockets and she wasn’t afraid to use them.\n\nNo amount of poor or sad or weird was enough to keep Rachel from befriending strangers and reaching out to them with hope and love. She was inspiring and a little overwhelming.\n\nOne afternoon, Rachel invited me to a street music event she was staging on Kärntner Straße. She is a classical violinist and had gathered other string musicians to play a concert and share the gospel on that ancient, black stone street.\n\nFeeling both a little shy and peckish, I got a gelato and went antique shopping instead.\n\nI missed an opportunity. God didn’t need me to help share His gospel; His gospel will go forth whether I stand up and speak His name or not. In fact, if I can’t muster a good word about the Lord, Scripture says even the stones will cry out in my place (Luke 19:40).\n\nGod invites us to join His work, not for His sake, but for ours. God invited Esther to join Him in saving the Jewish nation. If Esther had refused to go to the king, God still would have saved His people, but she would have missed an opportunity. As Esther’s cousin Mordecai said: \n\n“If you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jewish people from another place, but you and your father’s family will be destroyed. Who knows, perhaps you have come to your royal position for such a time as this.”\n– Esther 4:14\n\nOur refusal to take part in God’s work doesn’t thwart God. It limits our privilege to take part in what He is doing. God can even use unrepentant sinners to achieve His good purposes. Consider Pharaoh, Caiaphas the high priest, and Pontius Pilate (Exodus 9:12; John 18:14; John 19:5-16). “But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).\n\nGod’s providence is comprehensive, wise, and holy. His timing and calling are no mistake, and just as He did with Esther, He has placed us here and now, for such a time as this. \n\nWe, like Esther, can have courage, comfort, and peace. From a human perspective, our lives and circumstances can seem totally out of control and scary. But we can rest in God’s providence, knowing that He is working. \n\nLook for God’s invitation to join Him in His work. Have courage, comfort, and peace—you can join Him now! You can always go get a gelato later.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 5:1-14, Proverbs 16:18, Mark 6:14-29\n\nIt was a dinner party with an enviable guest list. Sitting at the head of the table were hosts Michael Eisner, former CEO of Disney, and his wife, Jane. In charge of passing the bread baskets was their friend George Lucas, creator of Star Wars, as well as Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, the guests of honor.\n\nIt was sometime in the ‘80s and there was reason to celebrate. Dick and Jeana had just become the first people to fly around the world without stopping.\n\nAfter the dessert had disappeared from their plates and they’d heard story after story about Dick and Jeana’s worldwide adventure, Jane Eisner raised the question many of us would have asked. “Well, now that you’ve accomplished the pinnacle of your aspirations, what could you possibly do next?”\n\nWithout hesitation, Dick responded, “I’m going to Disneyland!” Without hesitation, Jane responded, “That’s a good slogan.” And so it was.\n\nFrom the 1987 Super Bowl on, the answer to, “You won! What are you going to do now?” became “Disneyland.” And yet, when we watch sports reporters ask this question, it always seems a little silly, doesn’t it? Because after the Gatorade coolers have been thrown, and the trophies have all been shined, the athletes already have exactly what they were after in the first place: victory. What else could a Super Bowl champion possibly need?\n\nIn the books of Esther and Mark, we find two very different women who happen to have their king’s ear—Esther and Herodias’s daughter. Both women are asked a remarkably similar question: “What is it you want? Whatever you want, even if it’s half the kingdom, will be done” (Esther 5:3; Mark 6:23, my paraphrase).\n\nThe similarities between their stories stop there. Overwhelmed with possibility, Herodias’s daughter consults her mother, asking what desires she ought to demand, and they soon decide on their perfect request: John the Baptist’s head. On a platter. Perhaps she believed that for them, the most beneficial and powerful thing that could happen would be the destruction of God’s people. Her choice reeks of pride.\n\nPride comes before destruction, and an arrogant spirit before a fall.\n– Proverbs 16:18\n\nEsther, on the other hand, asks the king and Haman to attend a banquet where she herself will be the one preparing the platters. This probably seemed like a strange request, even to Esther. But instead of dreaming about the riches that could be hers, she keeps her heart close to the Lord’s. Esther believes the most beneficial and powerful thing that could happen to her is the rescue of her people—of God’s people. Her request is steeped in humility.\n\nEsther lives from a rooted belief in the kingdom that’s already been won for her. She makes choices based on riches she’s already received. Because she trusts in the King on High, she takes joy in making herself low. What else could a beloved daughter of the King possibly need?\n\nMaybe we need to be asking each other new questions as we gather around our own dinner tables. After all, we’ve already been given the kingdom. Now, how will we act? What will we do next?\n\nMay those questions lead us to respond with humility. May they lead us back, again and again, to the heart of the Father.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 6:1-14, Proverbs 26:27, Isaiah 52:1-2\n\nAren’t we all born with a strong sense of justice? From a young age, we tattle on the wrongdoers and we vehemently defend what we call “ours.” We fight for what we believe to be fair. As we grow up, we hopefully mature in our understanding of right and wrong, just and unjust, godly and ungodly. \n\nThis sense of justice is the reason Mordecai’s honoring and Haman’s humbling is so satisfying as we read on in the book of Esther. We want the good guys to win and the bad guys to lose. We tend to like it when people get what is coming to them. As Proverbs 26:27 puts it, “The one who digs a pit, will fall into it.”\n\nIs it a coincidence then, that King Ahasuerus cannot sleep, and so he asks for the daily events to be read to him? No, this event demonstrates God’s sovereignty. In fact, the book of Esther is filled with “coincidences” and fortunate turns of events, making it evident that God is in control and actively working on behalf of His people. During a time of exile and suffering, God rescued His children through an unlikely orphan girl, enacting justice on their behalf. \n\nUnfortunately, the world is still a place of injustice today. We see the bad guys winning. We see evil, hate, death, and disease infecting the world. Life is far from fair for most—something we’ve probably all been told at some point. \n\nWe still cry out when someone wrongs us. We grieve when a devastating attack occurs somewhere in the world. We cannot accept the imperfection and pain of this life. C.S. Lewis said, “If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world.”\n\nWhen our hearts cry out for justice, for good to prevail over evil, our hearts are really crying out for heaven. We long for Christ to come back and make things right once and for all. We long for the new heaven and the new earth (Isaiah 65:17). \n\nIn the stories of Esther, Joseph, Moses, and others, God intervened to save His people because He loved them and He cared about their plight. The greatest demonstration of God’s love was certainly when the Father sent His own perfect Son to die in our place so that justice could be satisfied. We were ransomed because of how much God loves us and loves justice.\n\nWhile we wait for the second coming of the Lord, all is not lost. We have been called to join in the work of kingdom building with Christ even now (1 Corinthians 3:9). Although our final home is not here, we’ve been instructed to pray for God’s will to be done “on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10).\n\nEsther’s story was one of encouragement to the Jewish people in the midst of exile. It was a story to remind them that God is over all and God is good. In a less than perfect world, let Esther be a story of encouragement to all who believe.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 7:1-10, Psalm 91:2-3, Revelation 20:11-15\n\nLately, I have been in a season of waiting. There is a lot of transition and change happening in the coming months, but at the moment, I feel stuck—like I’ve been running full speed, but I’ve had to come to a sudden stop. There’s a huge ravine in front of me, and I’ve reached as far as the current path will take me. I have to wait for a bridge to be built before I can cross to the other side. \n\nBut I don’t want to wait for the bridge. Waiting for the bridge to be built takes too long; it takes away my power. Still, I know with absolute certainty that I cannot build the bridge by myself; I have to wait for the Creator to build it and show me the way. Yet even with the humbling knowledge that I cannot do it on my own, I am impatient. I want the control. \n\nAt this point in her story, Esther had been doing a lot of waiting. She had to wait and see if she would be chosen queen. She had to wait for the king and Haman to come to her banquet, and then she had to wait for her second banquet before asking if the king would save her people. Esther had to wait on God’s timing instead of relying on her own.\n\nIn a book where the name of God is never directly mentioned, God’s providence and all-encompassing power appear time after time. Esther goes before King Ahasuerus, nervous and unsure, but God’s presence went before her, as it does with us (Isaiah 45:2). God continues to be our refuge and our fortress in times of uncertainty and distress (Psalm 91:2). \n\nThough God’s presence was not explicitly stated in this scene with Esther, King Ahasuerus, and Haman, it is evident that He was there. He was there when Esther invited them to the banquet, there when she asked King Ahasuerus to save her people, and He was there in the midst of Esther’s fright and uncertainty. \n\nPerhaps when Esther first heard of Haman’s evil plot, she might have felt as if she were standing at the edge of a ravine. Unsure of where to go next, she simply had to wait for God to build the bridge and show her the way.\n\n And He did. He built the bridge, He led Esther across it, and He worked through Esther to save His people. God took Haman’s disastrous plan and turned it on its head, destroying Haman and restoring full life to the Jews so that they may proclaim His glory throughout the nations.\n\n",

My to-do list gets too long, and instead of just chipping away at it one item at a time, my stomach starts to hurt, my neck gets tight, and I just go back to bed. The rational thing to do is to simply move forward, pay the bills, write the essay I’m avoiding, and buck up. But I find that sometimes I just can’t muscle through. I find that my nose is raw from so much keeping to the grindstone. I can’t move forward for good or for ill. I am paralyzed.\n\nWe can get frozen in place when there’s too much to do, or even when there’s nothing to be done. In either case, panic and flight are the natural human responses to unfavorable circumstances. Both solve nothing, and both betray a lack of faith that God is in control. We find ourselves in that terrifying state of freezing indecision, yet He really only desires one thing: that we turn to Him in trust.\n\nTrust doesn’t mean we have to remain inactive. Often, trust means we must act. In those situations, God calls us to simply do the next right thing, and for the rest, cast our cares on Him (1 Peter 5:7). Do you have a ten-year plan? Good on you. Do you have no plans at all? That’s okay, too; start with the next right thing.\n\nEsther didn’t have a ten-year plan. Her future plans risked her neck, so she had every reason to be paralyzed by fear and indecision. But instead she cries out in agony, “How could I bear to see the disaster that would come on my people?” (Esther 8:6). Even though her enemy Haman had been dealt with, his evil plotting left behind a huge disaster and danger. Lives were at stake. How could her people be saved from destruction? In Esther’s case, King Ahasuerus turned matters over to Esther and Mordecai. \n\nThroughout Esther’s story, we have seen that so much has rested on favor. The favor the king showed Vashti, the favor he showed Esther, the favor the king showed Haman, the favor he showed Mordecai, then the favor he showed the Jews. This favor, of course, is often reversed. The king’s favoring of Vashti ended. Esther favored Haman by inviting him to the feast, but it was to his destruction. Mordecai was ignored, then favored. And finally, the Jews, once despised, were now favored of the king.\n\nAll of this favor is out of our control. Amidst flatteries and reversals, however, God’s favor for His people endures. The story of Esther is ultimately the story of God’s favor toward His people. It’s the story of Psalm 30:11-12: “You turned my lament into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness, so that I can sing to you and not be silent.”\n\nGod’s favor is the greatest surety there can be. We are called to trust Him and walk in obedience. We don’t need to give up and confine ourselves to bed, paralyzed by fear and indecision. We can move forward in confidence of God’s promises. If we trust ourselves to His care, we need not fear or be anxious. Though the whole world heave against us, or when everything is shrouded in darkness, He is King.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 9:1-22, Nehemiah 8:10, Luke 1:46-55\n\nWhen it comes to a blockbuster movie experience, I like to feel a tinge of tension. I don’t mind my emotions being pushed to the brink of disaster before the hero swoops in and saves the day—that is, while I’m sitting in a comfy seat with a jumbo tub of popcorn (extra butter, please). But in real life? Oh no. I’d rather play it safe. \n\nI don’t want to even come close to disaster, disappointment, or despair. I’d prefer to see God’s hand rescue me as soon as the thought that something could go wrong enters my mind. Wouldn’t you?\n\nGod knows this about us, and He knows what we need. His plan is always right on time. Never early. Never late. We see this play out among God’s people in the book of Esther. Haman’s evil edict of death was issued on the thirteenth day of the first month, sending God’s people into a panic (Esther 3:15). But deliverance did not come until the thirteenth day of the twelfth month. The only thing worse than panic is prolonged panic. Am I right? \n\nFor twelve long months God’s people must have pleaded with Him to rescue them. They must have worn paths in the kitchen floor pacing with worry. They must have resisted a million urges to run and hide the little ones they knew Haman had ordered to be killed. They must have fretted that God would not come through, worried they’d misunderstood His plan for them, or felt abandoned by the God who promised to protect them. \n\nDeliverance did not come twelve months early, or twelve weeks early, or twelve days early. \n\nDeliverance came “on the day when the Jews’ enemies had hoped to overpower them, just the opposite happened. The Jews overpowered those who hated them” (Esther 9:1). \n\nThat very day. \n\nThe second they arrived at the juncture they’d been dreading, the switch flipped, the tables turned, and their Great Deliverer delivered them from destruction. God’s people stood, ready to fight, eyeball to eyeball with their worst nightmare. God has promised He will care for us, but we cannot put grace to the side, storing it up for a moment we don’t want to face. \n\nWhen our enemies come for us, God will stand beside us. When our hearts are broken, God will be near (Psalm 34:18). When we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we will see His hand (Psalm 23:4). But we may find ourselves closer to suffering than we’d ever want to be, on our knees praying until they ache. Like Israel did as they fled their Egyptian oppressors (nearly 1,000 years before Esther pleaded for her people to be spared), we may feel the sting of a raging sea before us and hear the pounding of enemy chariots behind us before we are able to see God make a way. \n\nSo what do we do as we wait for our rescue? We stand firm in God’s promises, trusting that He will deliver us at exactly the right moment. We wait for His rescue. We wait on Him. Our God is able to shift our sorrow to gladness and our mourning into celebration (Esther 9:22). He will do it right on time, every time.\n\n",

Paris was warm and beautiful, and Napoleon’s army was 600,000 men strong. He was on top of the world, but Russia’s Czar Alexander was really starting to get on his nerves. He ignored French trade embargos, and worse, refused to let Napoleon marry one of his sisters. Frustrated but confident, Napoleon made his most ambitious plan yet: take Moscow and show Alexander once and for all who was the greater ruler.\n\nNapoleon crossed from Poland into Russia, his vast army advancing deeper and deeper into the countryside as the Russian forces burned their crops and fled before him. But as he advanced, Napoleon’s supplies and men began to dwindle. And although he did finally limp into Moscow in October, the wind and snow had started to swirl and bite—winter was coming. With only a sixth of his men remaining, Napoleon had to retreat, defeated not by Russia’s military, but by her freezing, obliterating winter.\n\nIf you’ve ever engaged in a land war in Asia, or even parented small children, you know things hardly ever go as planned. So why do we continue to believe we can control our circumstances? History and personal experience prove God alone is in control. The Red Sea parted, Jericho’s walls collapsed, and fire fell on Mt. Carmel—we are not the ones running the show.\n\nHaman planned to crush the Jews (Esther 9:24). He wanted to destroy them. We’ve seen examples of this kind of horrific racism all throughout history. In every era, men have shown this evil instinct to destroy other men for being different. They lay their evil plans, perhaps prevailing for a time, but in the end, their plans fall flat. They may cast the dice, but God alone controls the outcome.\n\nIn our own failed Napoleonic aspirations we are quick to become frustrated, lamenting, “Nothing ever goes like I plan!” But every failed human plan is actually cause for thanksgiving, because all things happen according to the good pleasure of God’s will (Romans 8:28). Likewise, when the enemies of God approach, armed with malice and intent upon blood, we can still give thanks. God Himself is our defense, and we should not fail to celebrate His good providence in all things.\n\nAt the end of the book of Esther, the Jewish people celebrate God’s deliverance. They not only celebrate in the present, but they vow to celebrate in the future—to remember who they are and what God has done:\n\n“These days are remembered and celebrated by every generation, family, province, and city, so that these days of Purim will not lose their significance in Jewish life and their memory will not fade from their descendants.”\n– Esther 9:28\n\nMay we also remember. May we remember, with Solomon, that “The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps” (Proverbs 16:9). May our hearts respond in thanksgiving because He alone is God, and there is no one like Him (Isaiah 46:9). May we celebrate our freedom in Christ by remembering what we’ve been saved from, and Who has saved us from it.\n\nMake your plans, but rejoice and remember: it is the Lord who had a good plan for us before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4). Glory be to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Restoration of Job",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI’ve always been afraid of the book of Job.\n\nI’m afraid of Job’s story, the way I’m afraid of Abraham’s, and Mary’s, and the disciples’. I’m afraid the cost of following Jesus will be too much for me—unlike Abraham, who obeyed God and prepared his son for sacrifice; and Mary, who was willing to face scandal as an unwed mother; and Jesus’s first disciples, most of whom died as martyrs. I’m afraid that, when faced with the sharp rock of suffering, my faith will shatter like glass. I don’t trust my flesh, which I know will fail. I’m afraid to live fully, to love completely, and trust wholly. I am afraid to suffer.\n\nOf course, I have suffered a variety of wounds, as we all have. If there is a more common thread to humanity than suffering, I’m not sure I know it. And so Job’s story is, naturally, my story. And your story, and your neighbor’s story, and every member of your family’s story, and that person who served you coffee this morning’s story too. In chapter 42, Job’s story ends with the same stunningly beautiful conclusion we are all offered: repentance and restoration.\n\nJob cries out, “I know that you can do anything.… I reject my words and am sorry for them” (Job 42:2,6). He knows that God is just, merciful, and mighty to save. Job doesn’t expect to be made whole, to have everything and everyone he’s lost restored. It is enough for Job to know that God is God and he is not, and to repent of his own pride.\n\nIn chapters 38–41, God speaks. He proclaims His power, His justice, His righteousness, and His sovereignty over all things. It’s a “mic drop” moment, one that needs no punctuation, no follow up. But after Job’s cry of repentance, God responds once more to Job in a manner so kind and lavish that we are compelled to react with just as much awe and wonder as we did when we read that He breathed all creation out of nothing. Yes, God is mighty, unrivaled in power. Yes, God is sovereign, unrivaled in His commitment to justice. But also, Yes, God is good, and He promises us bountiful restoration.\n\nJob received restoration in his lifetime—his fortunes returned, his flocks and herds multiplied, his home filled with new children. Our suffering may not, and often does not, end with restoration in this life. Death wounds us, sickness steals from us, broken relationships limit our ability to trust, and tragedy on a global scale haunts even our happiest days. Our hope is not in the here and now. Ours is a future hope, formed and grounded in God’s Word, molded by His mercy, and secured by His Son.\n\nWe will experience the restoration and renewal of all things, as promised in Revelation 21:3–5. It is the only ending that makes sense to our stories of suffering, the kind and lavish response of a loving Father who promises, one day, to wipe every tear from our eyes.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nIn Night, the seminal autobiographical novel about his experience in Nazi concentration camps, writer Elie Wiesel says this: “Some of the men spoke of God: His mysterious ways, the sins of the Jewish people, and the redemption to come. As for me, I had ceased to pray. I concurred with Job! I was not denying His existence, but I doubted His absolute justice.”\n\nBecause it deeply resonated with his own experiences with tragedy and suffering, Wiesel publicly lectured on the book of Job throughout his career as a professor and Nobel Prize-winning author.\n\nAs I was researching Wiesel’s work on Job, I remembered reading Night in middle school. Then, I had a second thought, one that made my stomach drop and my eyes flood with tears. I realized that one day, my daughter is going to read Night. One day, she is going to find out about the Holocaust. She’ll read about about slavery and Jim Crow and 9/11. She’ll find out about war, famine, genocide, opioid overdoses, and school shootings. One day, she will learn about suffering. And even harder still to imagine, one day, she herself will suffer.\n\nWhere will God be when she learns about these things? And can I trust Him not only with my own suffering, but with my precious baby girl’s?\n\nWhen my heart wavers and falters on the edge of faith, brought on by suffering and fear, I know I cannot stand on my own feelings. I must stand in faith, which is a gift of the Spirit, and I must pray unceasingly for Him to strengthen it. I must stand on the unwavering, infallible Word of God. Here is what it teaches me:\n\n1) God is just and good. He controls the wind and waves, the leviathan and behemoth, and every living creature.\n\n2) His Son Jesus, who is God incarnate, knew suffering here on earth, just as we do. But the suffering He endured was infinitely greater than anything we might bear, as He took on the weight of the world’s sins.\n\nSuffering belongs to all of us, through all time. One of the gifts that comes with reading Job through the lens of the New Testament is knowing that his story of suffering is our story and that Jesus came to secure true righteousness for all who believe in Him.\n\nGod’s justice is absolute. In the depths of suffering, it is no wonder we question it. God speaks to Job, “Would you really challenge my justice? Would you declare me guilty to justify yourself?” (Job 40:8). Would we?\n\nWe can trust God with our suffering because He is the Creator and King of everything. But we can also trust God with our suffering because Jesus suffered, bearing all of our sorrows to the cross.\n\nHe himself bore our sicknesses,\nand he carried our pains;\nbut we in turn regarded him stricken,\nstruck down by God, and afflicted.\nBut he was pierced because of our rebellion,\ncrushed because of our iniquities;\npunishment for our peace was on him,\nand we are healed by his wounds (Isaiah 53:4–5).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nA few days a week, our notoriously chaotic and tardy household experiences a mini miracle. Somehow, we make it downstairs in time to eat breakfast, and inevitably, my four-year-old daughter asks to listen to her favorite catechism songs. And before I’ve had one sip of coffee, it starts: kid voices, electronic synth background music, and “GOD IS THE CRE-A-TOR OF EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING!” Then it repeats, and repeats again, and even in my pre-caffeinated state, I’m aware and grateful that this will be the song my girl has stuck in her head all day.\n\n“What is God?” The answer to this question, in some form or fashion, is foundational to every Church creed. It’s also touched upon in the very first sentence of Scripture. Everything started from God, who has no beginning and no end. And implicit in the story of creation is the sheer goodness, creativity, and affection of our Maker.\n\nThis is the truth God thunders from the whirlwind when He appears to the long-suffering Job. His speech in chapters 38 and 39 hearkens back to the story of creation in Genesis chapter 1: God created the earth and sea, the light and dark, the weather, the stars, and the animals (Job 38:4–39:30).\n\nGod presents two challenges to Job during His speech, and these two chapters contain the first. God is essentially asking, Do you understand how all this was made? How it all works? He is challenging Job’s finite understanding with all these questions. He’s challenging Job’s focus on himself.\n\nGod is not finished with His speech, but the start of it is more than enough for Job to fall back into his place. He has been reminded of Who he is speaking to, and just what the Maker of heaven and earth is capable of doing. And we, like Job, can marvel at His majesty and find our provision in His mercy.\n\nThe Heidelberg Catechism, written in 1563, poses this question and answer about the first line of the Apostles” Creed:\n\nQuestion: What do you believe when you say,“I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth”?\n\nAnswer: That the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who out of nothing created heaven and earth and everything in them, who still upholds and rules them by his eternal counsel and providence, is my God and Father because of Christ the Son. I trust God so much that I do not doubt he will provide whatever I need for body and soul, and will turn to my good whatever adversity he sends upon me in this sad world. God is able to do this because he is almighty God and desires to do this because he is a faithful Father.\n\nGod is almighty and faithful, full of mercy and majesty, creativity and care. As He declares His infinite holiness in these chapters, He does so to one man, Job. But God’s message is an eternal, cosmic truth, an invitation for each of us to rest in the security of knowing that we, too, are intimately loved by our Creator.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nToday’s readings are about mercy and majesty, two perfect descriptors of our perfect God. He is indeed merciful, and He is the King. But toward the end of this book about suffering, these two truths stand on trial. God has yet to show mercy to Job. If He is King, and sovereign, and has dominion over everything, why has His faithful servant suffered so much?\n\nLike God Himself, weather is unpredictable, wild, and powerful. So when Elihu describes the power of God, he talks about the weather. “He says to the snow, ‘fall to the earth,’” and “Ice is formed by the breath of God,” and “He saturates clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.” The wild, untamable weather that, despite our most advanced radar and predictions, never does what we think it will—this weather is controlled by God, a testament to His sovereignty and majesty.\n\nI write this while most of the United States is gripped by deadly freezing temperatures, the lowest in a generation. I write this after seeing our local weather-people get utterly destroyed on Twitter because they missed a forecast for snow. And always, their defense is simply this: weather is WEATHER. It is, by its very nature, impossible to control. We can read the radar, the charts, the signs, but at the end of the day, weather does what weather wants. Or rather, weather does what God wants.\n\nBut God’s majesty does have boundaries, lines drawn by His character and His goodness. In 37:13 we read, “He causes this to happen for punishment, for his land, or for his faithful love” (emphasis added). In verse 23, we are told, “The Almighty—we cannot reach him—he is exalted in power! He will not violate justice and abundant righteousness.” God may be utterly other, higher than anything we can fathom, but He has bound Himself by His character. And His character, proclaimed by Elihu and written throughout the Scriptures, is steadfast and faithful love, justice, and abundant righteousness.\n\nThe answer to the question, Can we trust God in our suffering? is yes, because of His abundant righteousness. Yes, because of His perfect will and His unbreakable commitment to His people, to us.\n\nThe psalmist wrote:\nI wait for the LORD; I wait\nand put my hope in his word.\nI wait for the Lord\nmore than watchmen for the morning—\nmore than watchmen for the morning.\nIsrael, put your hope in the Lord.\nFor there is faithful love with the LORD,\nand with him is redemption in abundance (Psalm 130:5–7).\n\nWe can wait, and we can hope, even in the deepest suffering, because there is faithful love and redemption in abundance in the arms of our good Father.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nWhen I was a child in Sunday School, someone once told me that God answers our prayers in three ways: with a “yes,” a “no,” or a “not yet.” To be clear, I don’t think God’s answers are nearly as neat and tidy as that. His ways are mysterious, far bigger and more cosmic than we could ever perceive. As I look back on that teaching now, I wonder, What about when He just doesn’t answer? or What if His “answer” comes as painful, intense, soul-crushing silence? As for Job, he begins to wonder if God even hears him: “If only I had someone to hear my case! Here is my signature; let the Almighty answer me” (Job 31:35). But Job is not the only figure in Scripture who felt the absence of God.\n\nIn John 11, Jesus delays going to heal His friend Lazarus, who then dies. In response, his sister Martha tells Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died” (v.21). Martha had sent for Jesus, and His delay was silence in her ears.\n\nIn Psalm 13, David cries out, “How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?” (v.1). But in Psalm 55, David speaks with confidence that God really does hear him, even when he feels alone: “I complain and groan morning, noon, and night, and he hears my voice” (v.17).\n\nIn these chapters from Job, the young counselor Elihu is responding to Job’s cry for God to answer. He challenges Job’s pride, suggesting that God’s silence is in response to Job’s pride-filled assertions that he is righteous and does not deserve his situation. Elihu isn’t exactly compassionate toward Job, but he does speak some important truths about God.\n\nSometimes God is silent. Sometimes He speaks. But He is always just, the standard of all that is good and holy and right. He is the Almighty, the all-knowing, the only Author and Creator and Sustainer of our faith. As Elihu says, “It is impossible for God to do wrong, and for the Almighty to act unjustly” (Job 34:10).\n\nReading through the book of Job, this question has come to me again and again: Do you trust Him—even when He seems silent? My honest answer is that I try, but most of the time I fail.\n\nI see myself in Job, as he protests, “But I did everything right!”\n\nI see myself in Martha, blaming Jesus for not doing exactly what she wanted Him to do.\n\nI see myself in David, crushed by sin and desperate to see the Lord.\n\nIn all things—even His silence—do I trust that He still holds all things together? After all, He is God, and I am not. Therefore, “when God is silent, who can declare him guilty?” (Psalm 55:17). He does not answer to us.\n\nSo do I trust the One who spun out the stars, who exhaled Creation and all its glory? Do I trust the One who was born into the dark and cold, who wept blood in Gethsemane, who died a brutal death for me? My only response to His love is to offer mine in return, despite what I see or understand. I believe that one day, I’ll stand before my God in perfect peace, and all the fear and unbelief will be gone. Until then, His Word tells me that He is worthy of my hope and trust. He hears my cries and is not indifferent to my suffering, even when He seems silent.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nI recently had a conversation with a friend who is facing a trial at work. A co-worker spread a false rumor about her, and now my friend must defend herself and her character to her boss. We talked about how lonely and powerless the business of defending oneself can be.\n\nAt this point in Job’s trial, prosecutors Bildad and Eliphaz are winning. Although they have no evidence, they have made a strong case that Job has sinned and earned the punishment he is now suffering. Job has done his best to be his own defense attorney, defending his character to his prosecutors as well as to God. But his case is weak in the face of his dire circumstances, and the verdict seems to be leaning one way: Job has done something to deserve this punishment.\n\nEnter Elihu. Young in years but wise in spirit, Elihu pauses the impending verdict and suggests another way: “If there is an angel on his side…to be gracious and say, ‘Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom’” (Job 33:24–25).\n\nAfter reading those words, I breathed a sigh of relief. Finally someone is suggesting that Job doesn’t have to do anything to get himself out of this situation. He doesn’t have to plead with God or somehow correct the unrighteous behavior we still have no proof of. There is a third way in the form of ransom.\n\nElihu speaks of a gracious and loving God in these chapters, one who is willing to forgive, keep us from death, and ultimately restore us to righteousness (v.26). This is the God I have come to know through Jesus Christ, who is more than an angel—He is my Savior.\n\nWhereas both Job and my friend were innocent, the case brought against me is true. I have done wrong. I have sinned. There is no defense I could muster against that prosecution. Yet, by the blood of Christ, I have received the same ransom Elihu suggests here. Jesus is my defender so that I don’t have to defend myself.\n\nBecause of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ, Elihu’s hypothetical scenario is our everyday reality. We have a defender. We have a good Judge who has restored us to righteousness. Because of this, we walk in grace, not judgment. And we step forward without fear, knowing that when we one day see His face, it will be “with a shout of joy” (v.26).\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nAs if Job’s suffering isn’t enough, he must now endure the scorn of onlookers, men who spit on him and openly despise him, simply for the suffering that’s befallen him. Worse, these onlookers were once far beneath Job on the social, economic, and moral ladder (Job 30:1). Now, they’re mocking him. Job falls into a unique type of despair caused when you are suffering but those around you are not.\n\nNo one was literally spitting on me, but I have certainly experienced scorn for my suffering from those around me. I experience it most on social media. Whenever I see a friend post about something she has that I don’t, but wish I did, I feel the scorn. A husband, a child, another book coming out—posts about these things can strike a sensitive nerve in me, a place that quietly suffers from loneliness, longing, and lack. Because of this, a simple engagement announcement, wedding photo, or book-cover reveal can feel like torture to my heart.\n\nUnlike the wicked men in our reading today, this mocking is completely unintentional on the part of my friends, but it still has the power to deepen my despair, not only because comparison is the thief of joy, but because the voice of the mockers convinces me that I am alone in my suffering. Everyone else’s life seems to be moving along according to plan. Mine is not.\n\nI wonder if Satan sent the mockers to Job, and I wonder if he did so knowing how frail we humans are in the face of loneliness. Suffering is difficult. Suffering alone is unbearable.\n\nPerhaps this would be Job’s tipping point. I would have understood if it was, but Job still cries out to God. It is a despairing cry, but a cry nonetheless: “I cry out to you for help, but You do not answer me” (Job 30:20). His words foreshadow the ultimate cry of despair when Christ hangs on a cross and asks, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” (Matthew 27:46).\n\nChrist suffered. Christ was mocked in that suffering. Christ felt forsaken by God. All of Christ’s work and ministry led to those hours of scorn on the cross. And yet, I continue to sit in my suffering, I look at the thriving lives of those around me, and I convince myself I am alone when the exact opposite is true.\n\nThis is why the companionship of Christ and the knowledge of His suffering are so important to hold onto in our darkest times. If we do not listen first to these truths, we will only hear the voices of the mockers telling us we are alone.\n\nBut you are not. We are not. Not in this. Not ever. Jesus has cried out on our behalf, and because of Him, we are not forsaken, not abandoned, and never forgotten in our suffering.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nI have a new addiction, and it’s called YouTube. A couple of weeks ago, my doctor prescribed a new diet for me. I got on YouTube to see if anyone had tried it and had any meal ideas. Approximately two-hundred million people have and they do. I watched approximately two-hundred million of their videos. Each day I visit again, hoping to learn more.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with looking up a recipe on YouTube, but when forty-five minutes have passed, and I’m still watching people talk about “What I Eat in a Day” or “How I Grocery Shop,” it could be that I am looking for more than a simple recipe. Like the gold and silver miners Job describes, I am probing the “dark recesses” for something valuable.\n\nIn today’s reading, Job describes the difficulty of finding and attaining wisdom. According to him, wisdom is invaluable, almost impossible to find, and only known to God (Job 28:20,13,23).\n\nThe way to wisdom. That is the ultimate aim of my search. To know what is good, right, and wise. And yet, I am looking for it in the wrong place. I am mining for gold, not wisdom.\n\nDo you know what happens after I spend forty-five minutes watching videos of chefs and health gurus? I don’t actually get more knowledgeable. I get more confused. With so many different opinions about what to eat and when, I don’t know whose voice to heed.\n\nJob’s quest for wisdom does not lead him to a certain location or web address. It leads him to Almighty God: “The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom. And to turn from evil is understanding” (Job 28:28).\n\nThough the internet will convince us otherwise, as Christ-followers, we have access to this wisdom and understanding. As Paul told the church in Corinth, “But it is from Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became God-given wisdom for us” (1 Corinthians 1:30).\n\nChrist is the physical manifestation of God-given wisdom, and with our knowledge of the Word and by the power of the Holy Spirit, we have access to this wisdom. The Gospels tell us how Jesus ministered, prayed, made decisions, and treated others. The Holy Spirit indwells us so that we can discern how to use Christ-like wisdom in our everyday lives.\n\nGod-given wisdom does not leave us confused. It does not make us question whose voice to heed or what to do. God-given wisdom is clear. It is written in the Word, and it has been written on our hearts. This is why forty-five minutes spent reading the Gospels does not create the same angst and confusion as forty-five minutes spent online.\n\nAs we venture out on our quests for wisdom, let us seek true, God-given wisdom. Let us turn first to the life of Christ. For if He is in you, so is wisdom.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nMy experience in the Christian life often feels like being on a train that’s traveling through the mountains. One minute the view out my window is crisp and clear. I am certain of how to do right in the eyes of God. But the next minute, I am in a tunnel, and the once-clear view goes dark. Life gets complicated, and I am not sure how to navigate it in a righteous way. In these times, I have often asked the questions that Bildad did: “How can a person be justified before God? How can one born of woman be pure?” (Job 25:4–5).\n\nInstead of directly answering Bildad’s question, Job replies with a list of acts that exemplify God’s power: “By His power He stirred the sea… By His breath the heavens gained their beauty” (Job 26:12–13). Similar to our reading from yesterday, it seems that Job is asking a better question now. Instead of how—How can man be righteous?—he asks who—Who is God? These questions might seem unrelated, but one must be asked before the other can be answered.\n\nA few years ago, during a tunnel season of intense anxiety, I felt like I could not see up from down. I wasn’t sure what I was doing right and what I was doing wrong. Thinking and analyzing my way through things wasn’t working; it simply increased my anxiety. Finally, I turned to what I knew. Each morning, I wrote down five things I knew to be true about God, even if I only believed it that day. I scrawled truths like, He is fighting for me. He is my Creator. And eventually I began to write, He is good.\n\nThis was not a quick fix for my anxiety, but it helped me weather the season until I came out the other side, and it taught me that when it comes to our own righteousness, the question is not how but who. When I am asking what to do, what is right, I need a friend to tell me, as Job told Bildad, “I will teach you about God’s power” (Job 27:11).\n\nThis is where our rightness begins, with a God who loves us, and in that love sent His Son to make us righteous. If we stand any chance of doing good on this earth, our actions must be motivated and sustained by that love—the love of Christ and of the Father who sent Him. It is the who that makes us good, not the how. And while the how may change as we grow and learn in faith, the who never does. The truth of Christ remains the same.\n\nMay we rest in God’s goodness today and let go of the quest for our own. For in the end it is all by His power; it is all by His breath.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nIn Eliphaz’s third and final speech, he accuses Job of wickedness. Grasping for a reason behind his friend’s suffering, Eliphaz must believe his friend has done something to deserve this. If he hadn’t, surely God would not have allowed this amount of suffering to befall him.\n\nHow quickly our faith reduces to a formula when in crisis. If I do good works for God, God will bless me, right? Job knew that no matter what he did or did not do, God “is unchangeable, who can oppose Him? He does what he desires” (Job 23:13). Which leaves us wondering, if the outcome will always be the same, why even bother with trying to do good?\n\nI recently moved into a house with a newly remodeled kitchen. It is neat and pristine on the surface, but I have learned that the pipes beneath it are not. Previous owners committed the cardinal sin against sinks. They put grease down the drain, and now I’m dealing with a clog.\n\nAs several different plumbers have come in and out of my home, I have learned that a beautiful kitchen is worthless if the pipes are bad. When it comes to kitchens, it is only what’s beneath the surface that allows everything to function, flow, and thrive. When it comes to us, it is the same.\n\nTo the church in Galatia, Paul wrote, “For whatever a person sows he will also reap, because the one who sows to his flesh will reap destruction from the flesh” (Galatians 6:7–8). For whatever a man puts down the drain, he will also see it come up again.\n\nGod cares about our good works, not because they affect His will—He is unchangeable, who can oppose Him?—but because they affect who we are. As Paul continues, saying, “the one who sows to his flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit” (v.8).\n\nWe must not get tired of doing good, not because our good deeds will lead to good circumstances, but because sowing goodness leads to a life of trusting in the Spirit—the type of life that can withstand trials with faith.\n\nJob seems to have the opposite problem of my kitchen. His life is in shambles, his kitchen a disaster zone, but the plumbing is clear. He is asking why, as we all would, but he is also asking a better question: where? Where is God in the struggle? “If only I knew how to find him,” he pleads, “so that I could go to His throne” (Job 23:3).\n\nThrough our great High Priest Jesus Christ, we have direct access to the throne room Job seeks. Because of this, although we can’t always be confident of the why, we can be confident of the where. Where is God in our suffering? Right there with us in the midst of it.\n\nWhatever suffering befalls you today, know that God is near. And His Spirit is allowing you to do good, so that even if your physical life is in shambles, you can be confident the life inside of you is eternal. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\n“Why do bad things happen to good people?”\n\nThis is a question we’ve all asked at some point in our lives. And up until this point in our reading of Job, it’s been the essential question. In other words, how else could Job’s excruciating circumstances be explained here, “on the ground”? (Job 1:20). No one sitting around Job had access to the heavenly scene you and I read in chapters 1 and 2, so how else were they to understand the human wreckage sitting right in front of them? As far as Job’s friends were concerned, the only possibly explanation was that Job must have committed some egregious sin.\n\nJob and his friends did have the same fundamental theological framework. With this in mind, they reasoned that if people are good, they can expect God to be good to them in return. (This also sounds an awful lot like a message from today’s culture.) Sinful behavior, on the other hand, results in disastrous consequences. (We see this laced throughout God’s instructions at Sinai, emphasized by the prophets, and threaded throughout later books as well.) But this a human expectation. We believe life is supposed to be fair. Turns out, it’s not—which is why we hear the steady drumbeat of this question throughout Job: “Why do bad things happen to good people?”\n\nIn this chapter, that question gets turned somewhat on its head, inverted: “Why do good things keep happening to bad people?” Why are some wealthy and seemingly untroubled while others struggle day in and day out? In our cultural terms, we wonder how someone can afford to travel abroad to exotic places while others have to work three jobs, struggling to keep food on the table. Why do some people seem to lead such peaceful lives? How do some get away with blatantly rejecting God? None of it seems fair.\n\nZophar’s emphatic response was this: the sinful may lead lives that look just peachy on the outside, but it’s all fleeting (ch. 20). Those who mistreat the poor and greedily hoard everything in sight—in the end, they will be crushed under God’s judgment and end up in the terror of utter darkness. Job’s response to this? Basically, “Yeah, right.” From what he had seen, the lives of immoral people were often golden. Their families were fine, they lived in security, and they were prosperous.\n\nLetting the wicked get off scot free is not justice, Job reasoned. Most of us would agree with him, I suspect, as we watch all kinds of contemporary injustices parade across our television screens daily. But Job’s observations—while spot-on, to be sure—are not the only perspective. Scripture gives us another view, another way to regard the wicked who seem to flourish in this world. As the psalmist declared, it is only for a season. Those who wait on the Lord, those who hope in Him, will see justice (Psalm 37:34–36). And it is in the waiting that we, like Job, must trust in God and His righteous character, rather than trusting in what we perceive with our own eyes.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Bildad’s Second Speech and Job’s Reply",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nIn the wake of Bildad’s second speech (Job 18)—a terrifying description of the darkness, entrapment, and utter destruction awaiting the wicked—Job lamented. He returned his focus once again to how God had destroyed him in every way. He mourned his lost hope and the feeling of being trapped in his circumstances (Job 19:10,12). He lamented that he was a physical wreck and that all of his household—relatives, guests, servants, and even his own wife—now despised him (vv.13–19,20).\n\nIn other words, Job’s extreme suffering continued. But now it was interlaced with crushing social abandonment. Nevertheless, what Job said next stands as a radical alternative to despair:\n\n“But I know that my Redeemer lives” (v.25).\n\nA “redeemer” was a family member who bought back persons or property that had been lost to the family due to poverty. We know the practice well from the selfless action of Boaz, when he redeemed the property of Naomi’s family and married the widowed Ruth. We know of the redemption and deliverance of God’s people Israel from their enslavement in Egypt. And we remember how Isaiah repeatedly called the Lord “God of Israel,” “the Redeemer,” and “the Holy One of Israel.”\n\nJob’s own declaration about God is woven within this same rich tapestry of faith. Having just said that his own relatives, or “kin,” had completely deserted him, Job fully affirmed that his “kinsman-redeemer,” his God, would not fail to rise up to vindicate and buy him back. “But I know” tells us something about Job’s confidence in God—so much so, that he asked that his words be inscribed as a witness for the future (vv.23–24)—and so they were!\n\nJob’s profound vow of hope continues on as he proclaims that he will see his Redeemer:\n“Even after my skin has been destroyed,\nyet I will see God in my flesh.\nI will see him myself;\nmy eyes will look at him, and not as a stranger.\nMy heart longs within me (vv.26–27).”\n\nPerhaps he was echoing the symbolism of dust from Genesis 3, or maybe he anticipated restoration from his present illness (2:8;7:5). Regardless, his words are telling: he knew God would remain faithful. The bottom line is this: Job affirmed that he would see God. He was clinging to the truth that he knew. Seeing his Redeemer was what Job wanted more than anything else, and indeed he did, as we will read later in the book (ch. 38–41).\n\nThe beauty of this beloved passage lies in a paradox. On one hand, we see the ambiguity of never really knowing how or when our pain, suffering, and weariness will end. But on the other, we see Job’s fierce, unwavering hope. Hope compelled him forward, re-anchoring and recentering him to his faith. May we learn to do the same. Let us trust in the name of the Lord, relying on Him alone (Isaiah 50:10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nHow many times has some very well-meaning person tried to assuage your heartache with words, saying something along the lines of this: “God will comfort you and see you through this. He always does.” Or this: “Just hang in there. Evil people always get what they deserve.”\n\nLook closely, and you’ll see those two sentiments are basically parts of Eliphaz’s second conversation with Job. So why are they a problem? Well, for one thing, the latter suggests that Job must be evil too—why else would he be suffering badly? Their conversation leads to the question: How do we truly weep with, mourn with, and comfort those who are broken? How do we become true comforters? (Romans 12:15).\n\nFirst, we need to read and truly absorb Job’s scorching honesty in chapters 16 and 17, where the stakes are even higher. Just a reminder: God refused to allow Satan to take Job’s life, which means Job’s torment was as bad as it could possibly get with no relief anywhere, falling just short of death—and Job couldn’t exactly turn to morphine to numb the pain. So now the question becomes one of self-reflection: If we are the ones in the fiery furnace, how do we cling to our relationship with God when it feels as if it is all going up in smoke?\n\nThese two questions are tied together, because those who weep and mourn most effectively will have climbed into that fiery furnace of suffering in some way. In doing so, they join the “Jobs” of the world. So for both situations, we wonder:\n\nWhat does true faithfulness look like, both for the one who comforts and the one who suffers? \n\nWhat part does prayer play in our suffering? \n\nWhat does it mean to bring all our emotions—even our anger, doubt, and feelings of betrayal—before God?\n\nAfter all, Job’s protests were laced with accusations. If his suffering teaches us anything, it is to strip away all pretenses—physical and spiritual. God had worn out and torn up Job, seized him by the neck and dashed him to pieces to the point that Job’s face was red from weeping (Job 16:7–9,12,16). His dark anger boiled over in agonizing questions, as he protested the stony silence of God.\n\nStill, more than anything else, Job longed for his shattered relationship with God to be mended. He’d already sought out a mediator to bring them together (9:33–35; 16:21). He also repeatedly begged to talk with God—which he ultimately did in the most extraordinary of circumstances. Most importantly, Job returned to this understanding: his “advocate” and “witness” were set apart on high (16:19). Job remembered who he was and who he was not—he was not God. All of this points to Job’s faithfulness and his very real relationship with God.\n\nSo how do we sit with someone in their despair? How do we pray in the midst of others’ suffering, as well as our own? In my own experience, words like “Lord have mercy! Christ have Mercy!” bring me back to the truth of God’s character, of both His unfailing lovingkindness and ultimate sovereignty through Jesus Christ. Our Savior reaches through our blinding pain to comfort and deliver us. Our prayer for mercy, offered with humility and hope, binds us together before the God who comforts, even from on high.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nWhere does Job’s hope lie, and where does our own?\n\nPause for a moment to reflect back on one of your darkest times. Perhaps you tossed and turned for sleepless nights, futilely attempting to unravel the tangled web created by bad decisions. Perhaps you agonized over a bitter and angry child. Perhaps physical pain incessantly pierced and jabbed at you. Perhaps… Perhaps. No matter what our individual calamities, each one of us has been (or will someday be) there with Job, drained of strength and courage to face even the next hour. Where can we turn? Where can we place our hope? And how?\n\nWe may have to venture outside Job chapters 13 and 14 to knit together those slender strands that constitute hope, especially in the midst of the unrelenting pain that chews away at every part of our lives. At this point in his terrible journey, Job contrasted human hope (quite unfavorably) to a chopped down tree. Even though the tree had been destroyed, it sprouted again when watered—not so, with those who sleep in death (14:7–12). With great courage, Job had previously declared that he was prepared to defend himself before God, knowing full well that no godless person could stand in His presence (13:15–16). But like most of our courageous statements, Job’s expectations faded almost as quickly as he spoke them. He was back in the gloom of his torment and suffering. For Job, the steady and irreversible disintegration of mountains and rock in the natural world were a fitting metaphor for the erosion of his hope (14:18–19).\n\nOf course, that is not the end of Job’s story—or ours. We affirm with saints through the ages that our faithful God does restore our lives and comfort us in our pain (Psalm 71:20–21). We believe we will be carried through the deep waters and the ravaging fire (Isaiah 43:1–2). We hold fast to the hope that Jesus is the resurrection and the life (John 11:25–26). And we believe God has the power to do all He’s promised to do (Romans 4:20–24). This means that if we are in Christ Jesus, we have crossed over from death to life—even now! (John 5:24–25). Did you catch that? It’s a truth worth repeating, this time with the apostle Paul’s words, who tells us that right now, this very moment, we are seated in the heavenly realms with Jesus (Ephesians 2:6).\n\nHow do we respond? I confess I’m tempted to be a bit skeptical from time to time. You too? Thankfully, there is another path on which to set out at this point. Even from the crucible of our suffering and discouragement, we can take up the mantle of the psalmist. We have the privilege of declaring God’s goodness, of proclaiming the richness of God’s immeasurable and precious grace, and of being increasingly thankful (Psalm 71:14–18). Gratitude trumps grumpiness—every time, in all circumstances. The Apostle Paul affirmed that as well, saying, “Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus” (1 Thessalonians 5:18).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Zophar’s First Speech and Job’s Reply",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nHere’s a question: Can anything good come out of the mouths of Job’s friends? I don’t know about you, but I occasionally find myself thinking (dismissively), “Yes, but one of Job’s friends said that.” The subtext is that we can safely skim over what they said and then move on. The three friends, however, had some extraordinarily good theology; it just happens to have been misapplied.\n\nThe three “friends,” “comforters,” or whatever we label those well-meaning fellows, arrived from afar in order to weep, mourn, and sit silently with Job. Their intentions were noble—until they started to speak! After they sat silently with Job for a whole week, Job set them back on their heels with a deeply troubling lament. In response, the first two friends tried to cajole Job into confession and repentance, but he would have none of it. His response was to ask why God was so cruelly oppressing him, which had left him longing for the darkness of the grave.\n\nWhat do we say in response to that kind of raw pain? When we find ourselves in such circumstances, we stumble about, trying to be “meaningful” in our comforting. Toward that same end, Zophar ventured in, declaring that God is utterly transcendent and all-powerful beyond the highest heaven and the depths of the grave. This is true, but a gnawing question remains: how can we really wrap our minds (and hearts) around this majestic, sovereign transcendence of God? And then how do we talk about it, especially when we are face to face with seemingly interminable agony? How can we assure suffering friends that our God is both exalted far above all earthly powers and, at the same time, relentlessly and intimately loving? What comfort lies in that combination?\n\nZophar’s next words head down the path we so often take. Having professed the mystery of God’s ways, Zophar proceeded to speak for God, promising an array of hopeful results—if Job would just confess his sins!\n\nIt is no wonder Job was unimpressed. At the same time, he picked up on the most important part of what Zophar said and fleshed out his own perspective on it. Job indeed knew that nothing in God’s universe was outside God’s control, but he had come to know the dark side of that—devastation of land, degradation of the rich and powerful, whole nations destroyed and dispersed. The upshot for Job was that God was responsible for his suffering in that He allowed it. This is bold honesty. And that is where we need to be, frightening as it might actually be to say (and hear) these things. But we must remember that in the end, God affirmed what Job had said (Job 42:7–8). May that be a profound encouragement to us as we wrestle with how to express the truth of suffering.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nOne of my kids got into trouble last week, and it was that kind of interesting trouble all the other kids love to talk about. Juicy trouble is everyone’s favorite kind of trouble. So his siblings talked, and he was furious at the humiliating injustice of being talked about. I overheard my husband trying to explain to him that if he had acted justly in the first place, the others would have nothing to say.\n\nMy little fella isn’t alone. We are all inclined to think that we are right and everyone else is wrong. We like our own version of justice. We are quick to condemn the faults of others and justify ourselves. But we cannot be our own standard of justice, because we are finite and fallen.\n\nThis is why it’s hard to understand the book of Job. Bildad’s perspective is more familiar than Job’s, because like Bildad, we redefine righteousness to suit our own ends and try to treat justice like karma. Want to know who has sinned? Look and see how they “got what was coming to them.” But justice isn’t karma. It’s a mistake to assume that when something good happens to us, it is because we’ve been good. When we hum along with The Sound of Music’s Fraulein Maria, saying, “Nothing comes from nothing… I must have done something good,” we are singing the same tune as Bildad.\n\nInstead of basing our outcomes on our actions, Job points out two things. First, justice is God’s, not ours: “Even if I were in the right, I could not answer. I could only beg my Judge for mercy” (Job 9:15). God is the righteous one. When He acts, no one can condemn Him. No one can contend with Him. This is uncomfortable, because we like justice to be defined our way.\n\nSecond, God is sovereign. Whether things go right or seemingly wrong for us, God is still in control. Nothing happens outside of His will. “If it isn’t he, then who is it?” Job asks rhetorically (v.24). We’ve already glimpsed into the heavens at the beginning of Job, where God gives Satan permission to torment a righteous man. God’s sovereignty is uncomfortable, especially when the wicked seem to succeed and the righteous suffer.\n\nSo we struggle with questions like these: “Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?” (8:3). The clear answer is a resounding “No!” God’s thoughts are higher than ours, and His ways higher than ours, and we cannot answer or contend with Him (Isaiah 55:8–9).\n\nLike Job, we want to know why God allows bad things to happen (Job 10:18). But there are a lot of things we don’t get to know in this life. It shouldn’t surprise us that we cannot fully comprehend the Almighty, that He doesn’t bow to our will. But there is good news: God is good, and we are safe in His care (v.12). We need not fear. When we, like children, don’t see the whole picture, we can still trust that God’s justice is good because He is good, and He cares for us.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nOne of my favorite lecture series from my first seminary experience (I’ve recently begun a second seminary adventure at the “mature” age of 55!) was about having a “high view” of God. We had lively discussions in class regarding how, in our modern era’s quest to make the gospel relevant, we’ve all but lost the kind of deep reverence prophets like Isaiah and psalmists like David displayed toward God. In our bumper-sticker theology, “God is my copilot” culture, we’ve unwittingly minimized the omniscience and omnipotence of the Alpha and Omega in an attempt to make Him more accessible.\n\nI remember being so convicted during those classes, realizing I didn’t revere God the way I should. I committed to being more circumspect in how I addressed Him in prayer and even how I carried His Word, holding my Bible as a precious treasure instead of carelessly shoving it into a suitcase or tossing it into the back seat of the car. I still hold to those convictions.\n\nHowever, as I look back over my walk of faith in the 20-plus years since that class, it’s clear I’ve often overcorrected, swinging into the opposite side of the doctrinal ditch. I didn’t always have the spiritual maturity to understand that having a high view of God doesn’t mean we need to have a degrading view of ourselves. Of course, humans are wicked and depraved apart from divine grace, but after we put our faith and hope in Jesus Christ, we’re allowed to shrug into His robes of righteousness, knowing we have been adopted into the family of God as full heirs! (Romans 8:14–17). A high view of God should open believers’ hearts and minds to what our heavenly Father says about us, His beloved children.\n\nNow, if we give Job’s three friends a big benefit of doubt, we can assume they had mostly good intentions when they delivered their self-righteous lectures. However, like a young seminarian armed with more head knowledge than spiritual maturity, their arrows missed the mark by a country mile!\n\nJob understands the situation well. He says, “What strength do I have, that I should continue to hope? What is my future, that I should be patient?… Since I cannot help myself, the hope for success has been banished from me” (6:11,13). Job cannot change his bleak situation, despite his innocence.\n\nBut that’s the point. Job’s friends recognized the frailty of humanity and our propensity to sin, but their view of God is way too small. Without the context of God’s redemptive grace, we still make everything about us! In Romans 8, Paul points to the future, complete redemption of all creation as our hope in the midst of present suffering. Though we are currently “subject to futility,” all things will one day be fully “set free from the bondage” into “glorious freedom” (Romans 8:20). This is our hope.\n\n“Now in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience” (Romans 8:24–25).\n\nJob’s friends got the frailty of humanity part right, but their concept of God’s attention missed His compassionate heart. The Lord was Job’s only hope, just as He is ours. With Christ, our mere humanity is transformed into glory befitting children of God, no matter what suffering we may be experiencing at the moment.\n\n\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nSoon after my parents divorced, Dad remarried. Then, he moved out of the city to forty-two acres of flat, cactus-dotted pastureland in Central Florida to pursue his dream of becoming a cattleman-rancher. I loved helping Dad take care of our small herd, especially a solid black calf we named “Inky,” whose mama died while giving birth to him. I nursed Inky with a bottle until he got strong enough to fend for himself. But it wasn’t long before that baby Hereford bonded to me and no longer wanted to stay in the pasture with the rest of the cows. Instead, he followed me around like an oversized puppy, curled up and sleeping outside the house with the our pack of snoring dogs, who completely accepted him despite the fact that he mooed rather than barked.\n\nWhen my sweet baby bull was about a year old, Dad told me it was time to assimilate him back into the pasture with the herd. I cried, insisting that he didn’t know how to be a cow anymore because he’d become part of our family. But Dad gently encouraged me to think of what was best for Inky, and so I relented. Sadly, not long after we transitioned him from pet back to farm animal, a pack of rabid dogs attacked and killed several cows in the herd, including Inky. And while Inky was a yearling big enough to defend himself, he probably didn’t because he saw dogs as friends, not as potentially dangerous foes. I was inconsolable, devastated by the realization that had I not turned Inky into a pet, he might not have been savagely attacked and killed. My less-than-tender stepmother, however, was annoyed at my grief over a “stupid cow.”\n\nI was just an 11-year-old girl at the time of that mini-tragedy, but that’s when I learned that grief is not an inclusive emotion. Deep ache tends to be an isolating event, and despair tends to put uncomfortable distance between the heartbroken and observers—especially if those observers haven’t processed their own grief and loss. It reminds me of American poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox’s most observed and enduring line: “Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep, and you weep alone.”\n\nJob certainly walked “the narrow aisles of pain” in solitude. Before the prologue of his story was even finished, he’d lost almost everyone who really mattered to him, except for his wife—who was more salt-in-his-wounds than a comfort at this point—and three so-called friends (Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar), a trio who quickly revealed their distaste for Job’s honest despair, distancing themselves from the awkward messiness of his grief with condescending admonitions. The low-blow gist of his loquacious buddy Eliphaz in chapters 4 and 5 is this: Job, you obviously have hidden sin in your life. That’s why you’re in this pit of destruction. So you may as well quit whining, because no one’s even listening to your prayers!\n\nWhen my stepmother callously referred to Inky as a “stupid cow,” she was technically correct; bovine creatures don’t have nearly as high of an intellectual capacity as humans. However, she was oblivious to the fact that I had a real bond with that baby bull, which is why she could so easily dismiss my grief as adolescent drama. And that’s essentially the chasm that becomes apparent between Job and his three miserable comforters. Not all of what they say to Job is technically wrong. In fact, most of what they say about God’s inscrutability is accurate in principle. But the spirit of their preaching is crooked because they ignore the fact that Job has a real relationship with God. And the messy, wildly honest grievances he airs actually prove the very real existence of that bond.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nI once had a surgeon tell me I wasn’t a very good patient because I tried to “gut it out,” instead of being honest about the pain I was experiencing. Apparently, it’s hard on a healer when a patient masks their symptoms; making a diagnosis can become a bit like trying to shoot at a moving target.\n\nMy doctor believed my stubborn refusal to admit pain reflected my lack of trust in his competence as a physician. In Job chapter three, we see that Job is honest about his own pain, which is a clear indicator that he truly wants to be healed and trusts in the competence of the Great Physician. It would take me a long time to learn that instead of exacerbating a painful experience, honest tears and the acknowledgment of pain can actually serve as a soothing pressure relief valve.\n\nBy contrast, between the amped-up sensation of reality television, the shrieking discord of current political affairs, and the twenty-four/seven barrage of social media that has saturated our culture, it’s entirely possible for real trauma and suffering to go unnoticed and untended. We rush to triage emotional hangnails but completely ignore the people around us who are bleeding out. Silence doesn’t always indicate bravery, but it is a pretty good indicator that we might not notice when someone is truly suffering.\n\nJob’s outburst is a healthy reminder that our Redeemer doesn’t rank our emotions on a scale from good to bad, allowing only “good” emotions like joy and peace while barring “bad” emotions like grief and disappointment. We do not have to censor ourselves before the God who knows our hearts better than we do. Scripture doesn’t instruct us to smile on the outside while we die on the inside—just the opposite, in fact (see 1 Samuel 1). Frankly, I believe one of the biggest fallacies perpetrated in communities of faith is that the closer we get to Jesus, the more we need to keep a lid on it. Stoicism is not a spiritual gift, y’all!\n\nWe need to understand there’s a colossal difference between disagreeing with God and denying His existence altogether. Job cursed the day he was born and expressed confusion, frustration, and even anger, at God over allowing tragedy to befall him—but he did not reject God. In fact, the tormented exasperation Job hurls toward God proves that he is anything but an atheist! He knows God holds all things together.\n\nFaith powered by God can stretch us far beyond our own capacity to endure. Still, it’s not our anguish that distances us from God; it’s our apathy. The main takeaway from Job chapter three: we can and should continue to bring all of who we are—including our anger, confusion, and disappointment—before God. We can trust Him with every piece of our hearts.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nDealing honestly, wisely, and compassionately with human pain is an integral part of our job description as followers of Jesus Christ. No one gets through this life unscathed. Everyone deals with pain and suffering at some level. If someone insists she hasn’t, she’s either lying, in denial, or has amnesia. And since God’s second most important command is for us to love our neighbors as we love ourselves, it behooves us to learn how to better comfort ourselves as well as our neighbors—both those we rub shoulders with daily, and also our global neighbors, who make up the lost and dying world we’re called to care for.\n\nBut let’s deal with the proverbial bull in the china shop, which is the fact that what happened to Job wasn’t what we like to think of as “fair.” I mean, goodnight! The very beginning of this Old Testament book describes Job as a really good guy who was doing really good things with his life. The mention of Job rising early to pray for his kids (Job 1:5) is a common Hebrew idiom denoting a conscientious habit, which means praying for his family was something he did consistently.\n\nReading about this righteous guy losing pretty much everything—his wealth, his health, and all ten of his children—it’s like biting into a warm brownie and breaking your tooth on a rock. This “divine test” is surprisingly unfair. Surely Job didn’t deserve such devastating loss.\n\nIn the New Testament, Jesus blows the idea of human deservedness right out of the water. In His Sermon on the Mount, He teaches that God throws fairness out the window to bless even the unrighteous (Matthew 5:43–45). In another place, He explains that bad things do indeed happen to good people (Luke 13:1–5). And in His parable about the workers in the vineyard (Matthew 20:1–16), He thoroughly deconstructs any notion that we can earn God’s blessings.\n\nThe bottom line is this: No matter how many Bible studies we’ve done, or meals we’ve served to the homeless, we cannot earn one of those immunity sticks like they do on Survivor. None of us can get “good enough” to shield ourselves and those we love from suffering. Job proves that “good” people, including people of faith, can and do experience horrific things through no particular fault of their own. And if you want to really blow your mental hard drive, reread Job chapter 1, which suggests that while Job’s faith was truly strong, it did not safeguard him from hardship (v.8).\n\nIn the economy of God, Job’s suffering was an honor, a privilege. After all, “should we accept only good from God and not adversity?” (2:10). Our Creator and Redeemer handpicked Job for the honorable position of carrying the weight of pain. While God is not the author of evil (Psalm 5:4), He did choose Job with the foreknowledge that he would carry suffering well, because even our pain is a great conduit for God’s glory.\n\nCan you imagine how different our lives could be if we began to view some of our pain and disappointment as a divine privilege? What if we saw a difficult journey as one God handpicked us to take, knowing that He Himself would strengthen us to make the trek, and more importantly, that His glory would be illuminated through our efforts? Changing our perspective on suffering—viewing it as an honor instead of dumb luck or cruelty—could absolutely change the course of our lives and deeply impact the world around us.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and discipline. \n- Proverbs 1:7\n\nProverbs: The Way of Wisdom is a study which focuses on the application of biblical wisdom to our hearts and lives.\n\nThe Book of Proverbs itself is a collection of sayings, not a narrative, and much of it is not designed to be read in verse-by-verse order. Instead, Proverbs lends itself well to a topical approach, which is how we have arranged this study.\n\nWe’ve gathered a selection of wisdom sayings from throughout the Book of Proverbs into daily thematic readings. Each day’s reading is followed by a short series of questions to help you grasp the meaning of the text and then apply that day’s wisdom to your own life. This study is meant to be contemplative—light on the quantity of verses but heavy on the thoughts, questions, and prayers that flow from them.\n\nAs you come to each day’s proverbs, read them several times. Linger over them. Read them out loud if that helps you absorb them. Take time to turn them over in your mind. Then use the questions provided to help you connect the day’s Scripture with your own life.\n\nBe brave, and watch how God uses the humbling pursuit of wisdom to lift you up and draw you closer to Him.\n\nGrace & Peace,\n The She Reads Truth Team\n\n//\n\nSection One— God: Wisdom concerning the nature and values of God\n\nIn this first week of our study of Proverbs, we turn our attention upward to who God is and the wisdom He offers His people. We’ll explore topics such as the ways of wisdom and folly, the fear of God, what God commands, what God hates, and blessings and curses.\n\n//\n\nDay One— The Ways of Wisdom and Folly\n\nThe key foundational truth in Proverbs is this: to pursue wisdom is to pursue God, and to deny God is to walk in the way of a fool.\n\nWisdom is not just the accumulation of knowledge. It is a way we walk through life, seeking not only to know, but to interact with the truths of God. Folly, in the biblical sense of the word, is to hold the love and pursuit of truth in contempt by choosing to make our own path. A life of wisdom or folly comes from more than just the quality of the individual decisions we make. It comes from how we approach the journey of life as a whole.\n\nConsider these proverbs that describe the way of wisdom, and also the way of folly.\n\nThe Way of Wisdom\nProverbs 1:7-9\n\n7 The fear of the Lord\nis the beginning of knowledge;\nfools despise wisdom and discipline.\n8 Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction,\nand don’t reject your mother’s teaching,\n9 for they will be a garland of grace on your head\nand a gold chain around your neck.\n\nProverbs 2:1-12\n\n1 My son, if you accept my words\nand store up my commands within you,\n2 listening closely to wisdom\nand directing your heart to understanding;\n3 furthermore, if you call out to insight\nand lift your voice to understanding,\n4 if you seek it like silver\nand search for it like hidden treasure,\n5 then you will understand the fear of the Lord\nand discover the knowledge of God.\n6 For the Lord gives wisdom;\nfrom His mouth come knowledge and understanding.\n7 He stores up success for the upright;\nHe is a shield for those who live with integrity\n8 so that He may guard the paths of justice\nand protect the way of His loyal followers.\n9 Then you will understand righteousness, justice,\nand integrity—every good path.\n10 For wisdom will enter your mind,\nand knowledge will delight your heart.\n11 Discretion will watch over you,\nand understanding will guard you,\n12 rescuing you from the way of evil—\nfrom the one who says perverse things.\n\nAsk—\n\nQ. These words come near the beginning of the Book of Proverbs as a way to help us read everything that follows. What do these verses suggest is the goal of growing in wisdom?\n\nQ. According to these verses, what does wisdom give us?\n\nQ. What do you hope a month of studying God’s wisdom will produce in you?\n\nThe Way of Folly\n\nProverbs 3:35\n\nThe wise will inherit honor,\n\nbut He holds up fools to dishonor.\n\nProverbs 9:13-18\n13 The woman Folly is rowdy;\nshe is gullible and knows nothing.\n14 She sits by the doorway of her house,\non a seat at the highest point of the city,\n15 calling to those who pass by,\nwho go straight ahead on their paths:\n16 “Whoever is inexperienced, enter here!”\nTo the one who lacks sense, she says,\n17 “Stolen water is sweet,\nand bread eaten secretly is tasty!”\n18 But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there,\nthat her guests are in the depths of Sheol.\n\nProverbs 17:12\nBetter for a man to meet a bear robbed of her cubs\nthan a fool in his foolishness.\n\nProverbs 18:2\nA fool does not delight in understanding,\nbut only wants to show off his opinions.\n\nAsk—\n\nQ. Proverbs 9:13-18 describes folly as being secretive about our sin. Why is being secretive about sin foolish, and what is the value of letting trusted friends know the secrets in our lives?\n\nQ. Look at Proverbs 18:2. What is the difference between understanding and expressing your own heart?\n\nQ. What does it look like to “delight in understanding”? On what sorts of occasions do you do this in your life?\n\n",

Does it mean cowering under a rock for fear that if He sees us, He will strike us down? \n\nWhen the Bible talks about “fearing God,” it means we should revere God as holy.

What do you think it means to fear God in a way that actually cultivates intimacy between you and Him? \n\nQ.

This aspect of God’s nature is so wonderful because it plays out in every setting and circumstance—even in a broken world full of terrible things. To truly know God, and therefore truly walk in wisdom, we must know not only what God loves, but also what He abhors. \n\nConsider these proverbs about the things God hates.\n\nProverbs 6:16-19\n16 The Lord hates six things;\nin fact, seven are detestable to Him:\n17 arrogant eyes, a lying tongue,\nhands that shed innocent blood,\n18 a heart that plots wicked schemes,\nfeet eager to run to evil,\n19 a lying witness who gives false testimony,\nand one who stirs up trouble among brothers.\n\nProverbs 10:29\nThe way of the Lord is a stronghold for the honorable,\nbut destruction awaits the malicious.\n\nProverbs 11:1\nDishonest scales are detestable to the Lord,\nbut an accurate weight is His delight.\n\nProverbs 17:15\nAcquitting the guilty and condemning the just—\nboth are detestable to the Lord.\n\nProverbs 21:27\nThe sacrifice of a wicked person is detestable—\nhow much more so\nwhen he brings it with ulterior motives!\n\nProverbs 28:9\nAnyone who turns his ear away from hearing the law—\neven his prayer is detestable.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. Why do you think there are so many proverbs that talk about what God hates? Why is this important for us to know? \n\nQ. God hates abominations, but loves sinful people. When you are sinned against or are a witness to sin, is hatred something that rises up in you? If not, why do you think there’s no hatred? If so, what is your hatred directed at? How do these proverbs instruct us in how and what to hate? \n\nQ. Look at Proverbs 11:1. In what sense are we, as people, scales? Name at least one specific time you were a dishonest scale. How can we be “accurate weights”? \n\nQ. Look at Proverbs 28:9. What does the first half (turning our ears away from hearing the Law) have to do with the second (offering detestable prayers)?\n\n",

We’re exploring topics such as the ways of wisdom and folly, the fear of God, what God commands, what God hates, and blessings and curses.\n\n//\n\nDay Four: The Commands of God\n\nImagine what this world would be like if God had chosen to be silent and distant from His creation. Imagine if He had not given us His Word to guide us. Imagine how lost and morally bankrupt we would be—how hopeless we would be when it comes to understanding our identity and worth. \n\nThough it is part of our sinful nature to rebel against God, His commands are more than mere rules. They are one of the primary ways He has drawn close and revealed His character. The commands of God help us to know who He is and what He values for the children He loves. \n\nConsider how these proverbs guide us in approaching God’s commands with wisdom.\n\nProverbs 4:1-4\n1 Listen, my sons, to a father’s discipline,\nand pay attention so that you may gain understanding,\n2 for I am giving you good instruction.\nDon’t abandon my teaching.\n3 When I was a son with my father,\ntender and precious to my mother,\n4 he taught me and said:\n“Your heart must hold on to my words.\nKeep my commands and live.”\n\nProverbs 6:20-23\n20 My son, keep your father’s command,\nand don’t reject your mother’s teaching.\n21 Always bind them to your heart;\ntie them around your neck.\n22 When you walk here and there, they will guide you;\nwhen you lie down, they will watch over you;\nwhen you wake up, they will talk to you.\n23 For a command is a lamp, teaching is a light,\nand corrective discipline is the way to life.\n\nProverbs 29:18\nWithout revelation people run wild,\nbut one who listens to instruction will be happy.\n\nProverbs 30:5\nEvery word of God is pure;\nHe is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. We have all inherited a sinful nature and, therefore, we cannot keep God’s commands perfectly. So, according to these proverbs, what purpose do His commands serve in the day-to-day life of a Christian? \n\nQ. Where do you find yourself “running wild” (Proverbs 29:18)? What drives this in us—this desire to live without law?\n\nQ. Is it possible to live without law? If we reject the Law of God and say “I live by no law,” is there still a law governing us? If so, what is it? \n\nQ. When was the last time you received “corrective discipline”? Are you one who willingly receives reproof? If so, under what circumstances and from whom? If not, why not? \n\n",

We’re exploring topics such as the ways of wisdom and folly, the fear of God, what God commands, what God hates, and blessings and curses.\n\n//\n\nDay Five: Blessings and Curses\n\nFrom the time we are born, we learn that the decisions of life come with consequences. If a baby cries, she might get fed or changed. But if a toddler throws a tantrum, he might get a time-out. Consequences are not payments as much as they are the natural results of our actions. \n\nIn this life, we experience blessings and curses—consequences of choices we make or the choices others make that affect us. The preserving grace of God assures us that He is not temperamental or spiteful, but He does discipline His children. His discipline is for our flourishing because how we live and what we do matter in the here and now. \n\nThese proverbs value our present well-being without abandoning the biblical truth that love covers a multitude of sins.\n\nProverbs 3:33\nThe Lord’s curse is on the household of the wicked,\nbut He blesses the home of the righteous;\n\nProverbs 20:7\nThe one who lives with integrity is righteous;\nhis children who come after him will be happy.\n\nProverbs 28:20\nA faithful man will have many blessings,\nbut one in a hurry to get rich\nwill not go unpunished.\n\nProverbs 28:27\nThe one who gives to the poor\nwill not be in need,\nbut one who turns his eyes away\nwill receive many curses.\n\nAnd for fun:\n\nProverbs 27:14\nIf one blesses his neighbor\nwith a loud voice early in the morning,\nit will be counted as a curse to him.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. To what extent do you think you recognize God’s blessings in your life? What are some ways you believe God has blessed you? \n\nQ. To what extent do you think you are aware of God’s opposition in your life? Are there any areas of your life you feel God has thwarted or opposed? \n\nQ.

We should also assume that, for every situation we face, the wisdom of God is available to us if we ask. Both of these safe assumptions call for us to pay attention to the words of wisdom found in Scripture. \n\nThese proverbs call us to examine how seduction and strength work in our lives.\n\nSeduction\n\nProverbs 3:31-32\n\nDon’t envy a violent man\n\nor choose any of his ways;\n\nfor the devious are detestable to the Lord,\n\nbut He is a friend to the upright.\n\nProverbs 23:17\nDon’t let your heart envy sinners;\ninstead, always fear the Lord.\n\nProverbs 24:1-2\nDon’t envy evil men\nor desire to be with them,\nfor their hearts plan violence,\nand their words stir up trouble.\n\nProverbs 24:19-20\nDon’t be agitated by evildoers,\nand don’t envy the wicked.\nFor the evil have no future;\nthe lamp of the wicked will be put out.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. What is the most powerfully seductive voice speaking into your life right now? What is it promising that makes your heart want to follow? \n\nQ. With that answer in front of you, what is the deeper, God-given longing of your heart that lies beneath the desire you just named? \n\nQ. Who or what do you envy the most?

We’re examining ourselves in light of the wisdom God’s Word provides on the topics of seduction and strength, health and happiness, adversity and anger, counsel and instruction, and humility and pride.\n\nDay Nine: Health and Happiness \n\nThe first question of the Westminster Shorter Catechism asks, “What is the chief end of man?” and answers, “To glorify God and enjoy Him forever.” This answer assumes two profound truths: we are made to be happy, and we are eternal beings. The Bible has a lot to say about both of these. Our hearts and our health matter to God. \n\nThough we are eternal beings, God created us with bodies. He also tells us that we will have glorified bodies for all eternity, where there will be no more sadness or pain—only joy. Right now, however, we live in a fallen world where our joy is sometimes quelled and our bodies sometimes break. \n\nThese proverbs help us live now in light of the eternal comfort that awaits.\n\nHealth\n\nProverbs 4:20-22\n20 My son, pay attention to my words;\nlisten closely to my sayings.\n21 Don’t lose sight of them;\nkeep them within your heart.\n22 For they are life to those who find them,\nand health to one’s whole body.\n\nProverbs 14:30\nA tranquil heart is life to the body,\nbut jealousy is rottenness to the bones.\n\nProverbs 18:14\nA man’s spirit can endure sickness,\nbut who can survive a broken spirit?\n\nProverbs 25:25\nGood news from a distant land\nis like cold water to a parched throat.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. These proverbs hold physical well-being up as a good thing and as a benefit of spiritual health. How are the two connected? What are the spiritual reasons we should care about our physical health? \n\nQ. How would you explain the connection between wise counsel and “health to one’s whole body” (Proverbs 4:22)? Conversely, how can something like envy contribute to poor health? \n\nQ. Where do you turn when your spiritual health needs a lift?\n\nHappiness\n\nProverbs 3:13-14\n13 Happy is a man who finds wisdom\nand who acquires understanding,\n14 for she is more profitable than silver,\nand her revenue is better than gold.\n\nProverbs 14:10, 13\n10 The heart knows its own bitterness,\nand no outsider shares in its joy.\n13 Even in laughter a heart may be sad,\nand joy may end in grief.\n\nProverbs 24:17\nDon’t gloat when your enemy falls,\nand don’t let your heart rejoice when he stumbles…\n\nProverbs 29:18\nWithout revelation people run wild,\nbut one who listens to instruction will be happy.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. We all want to be happy in this life, but Colossians 3:2 tells us to set our minds on things above, not on earthly things. How do you see yourself placing value and identity in your own personal happiness, and how do you measure it?\n\nQ. Put into your own words a definition of godly happiness. What light does Proverbs 14:10&13 shed on true happiness? \n\nQ. Look at Proverbs 29:18. What is the relationship between happiness and obedience to God? \n\n",

It is easier to blame other people for the problems in our lives than to do the soul-searching work of admitting our own responsibility. The Bible cares about how we handle relationships in times of adversity and through seasons of anger. \n\nThese proverbs are like a hand on your shoulder, telling you to take a breath before you barge, guns blazing, into conflict.\n\nAdversity\n\nProverbs 3:25-26\n25 Don’t fear sudden danger\nor the ruin of the wicked when it comes,\n26 for the Lord will be your confidence\nand will keep your foot from a snare.\n\nProverbs 17:17\nA friend loves at all times,and a brother is born for a difficult time.\n\nProverbs 27:10\nDon’t abandon your friend or your father’s friend,\nand don’t go to your brother’s house\nin your time of calamity;\nbetter a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. Look at Proverbs 3:25-26. What dangers do you fear the most? What does it mean that the Lord is our “confidence”? \n\nQ. What is your general reaction to adversity? Do you tend to blame God for it? Do you reach out to Him for comfort? \n\nQ. What do you think Proverbs 27:10 is saying? \n\nAnger\n\nProverbs 3:30\nDon’t accuse anyone without cause,\nwhen he has done you no harm.\n\nProverbs 10:12\nHatred stirs up conflicts,\nbut love covers all offenses.\n\nProverbs 15:1\nA gentle answer turns away anger,\nbut a harsh word stirs up wrath.\n\nProverbs 17:14\nTo start a conflict is to release a flood;\nstop the dispute before it breaks out.\n\nProverbs 25:8\nDon’t take a matter to court hastily.\nOtherwise, what will you do afterward\nif your opponent humiliates you?\n\nAsk\n\nQ. What makes you angry? Why? In what ways do you see pride and anger working together in your life?\n\nQ. Based on the wisdom of these verses, do you think it is possible for you to harbor anger without it affecting anyone else? Why or why not?\n\nQ. Do you harbor anger? Does unresolved anger ever just go away? What hope does Scripture give us for our angry hearts (see Proverbs 10:12)? \n\n",

Desire to be taught. Nurture a curiosity to explore things you don’t understand.\n\nOn a purely intellectual level, these ideas make perfect sense—to the extent that they shouldn’t even need to be said. But because we are proud, our hearts tense up at the suggestion that we have much to learn. \n\nThe way of wisdom is about more than simply obtaining new information. It is about living as part of a community where we gladly regard one another as valuable. \n\nThese proverbs charge us to lay down our pride and seek counsel and instruction.\n\nCounsel and Instruction\n\nProverbs 3:6\n\nThink about Him in all your ways,\n\nand He will guide you on the right paths.\n\nProverbs 12:15-16\n\nA fool’s way is right in his own eyes,\n\nbut whoever listens to counsel is wise.\n\nA fool’s displeasure is known at once,\n\nbut whoever ignores an insult is sensible.\n\nProverbs 13:20\n\nThe one who walks with the wise will become wise,\n\nbut a companion of fools will suffer harm.\n\nProverbs 17:10\n\nA rebuke cuts into a perceptive person\n\nmore than a hundred lashes into a fool.\n\nProverbs 19:20\n\nListen to counsel and receive instruction\n\nso that you may be wise later in life.\n\nAsk\n\nQ.

How do you react to a command from God that you’re not particularly fond of? \n\nQ. What does it look like to walk with wise people? How is this something you are doing, or could do, in your life? \n\nQ. Think about those people who have counseled and instructed you.

We’re examining ourselves in light of the wisdom God’s Word provides on the topics of seduction and strength, health and happiness, adversity and anger, counsel and instruction, and humility and pride.\n\nDay Twelve: Humility and Pride\n\nIn Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis wrote, “the essential vice, the utmost evil, is Pride. Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere flea bites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.” \n\nThe wise person assumes the battle between humility and pride is always raging in our hearts. These proverbs help us understand that fight.\n\nProverbs 11:2\nWhen pride comes, disgrace follows,\nbut with humility comes wisdom.\n\nProverbs 15:33\nThe fear of the Lord is what wisdom teaches,\nand humility comes before honor.\n\nProverbs 22:4\nThe result of humility is fear of the Lord,\nalong with wealth, honor, and life.\n\nProverbs 27:1-2\nDon’t boast about tomorrow,\nfor you don’t know what a day might bring.\n2 Let another praise you, and not your own mouth—\na stranger, and not your own lips.\n\nProverbs 29:23\nA person’s pride will humble him,\nbut a humble spirit will gain honor.\n\nAsk \n\nQ. Where does pride have its strongest hold on you? \n\nQ. What is the difference between self-deprecation and humility? Why do you think we employ false humility in the ways we relate to others? What do we want it to do for us? \n\nQ. In these proverbs, humility is associated with wisdom, honor, and riches. Pride, however, is associated with shame. Do you functionally live as someone who accepts these connections or as one who rejects the idea that they are related? \n\nQ. We should be people who seek to praise God for the work He is doing in us. The gospel tells us that the Holy Spirit works in the lives of believers to make us more like Jesus (Philippians 2:13). This means He is working to cultivate humility in us. Name a place in your life where you can thank God for bringing you true humility? \n\n",

Relationships: Wisdom concerning our interpersonal lives\n\nThis week’s proverbs will turn our attention outward to the relationships we have with others. Let’s look at the the wisdom God’s Word gives us concerning parents and children, adultery, correction, and the power of the tongue.\n\nDay Fifteen: A Virtuous Woman\n\nProverbs 31 is the most comprehensive description of a godly woman in Scripture. It is also a poem—an acrostic—each line beginning with the next letter in the Hebrew alphabet. The poetic structure adds to the mystery, orderliness, and poetry of the woman being described.\n\nThough not all of the qualities here belong solely to women (Proverbs 31:16, for example), this chapter gives us an ideal personification of virtue—a person “who fears the Lord” (Proverbs 31:30). What are those virtues? Read the passage to see.\n\nProverbs 31:10-31\n10 Who can find a capable wife?\nShe is far more precious than jewels.\n11 The heart of her husband trusts in her,\nand he will not lack anything good.\n12 She rewards him with good, not evil,\nall the days of her life.\n13 She selects wool and flax\nand works with willing hands.\n14 She is like the merchant ships,\nbringing her food from far away.\n15 She rises while it is still night\nand provides food for her household\nand portions for her female servants.\n16 She evaluates a field and buys it;\nshe plants a vineyard with her earnings.\n17 She draws on her strength\nand reveals that her arms are strong.\n18 She sees that her profits are good,\nand her lamp never goes out at night.\n19 She extends her hands to the spinning staff,\nand her hands hold the spindle.\n20 Her hands reach out to the poor,\nand she extends her hands to the needy.\n21 She is not afraid for her household when it snows,\nfor all in her household are doubly clothed.\n22 She makes her own bed coverings;\nher clothing is fine linen and purple.\n23 Her husband is known at the city gates,\nwhere he sits among the elders of the land.\n24 She makes and sells linen garments;\nshe delivers belts to the merchants.\n25 Strength and honor are her clothing,\nand she can laugh at the time to come.\n26 She opens her mouth with wisdom\nand loving instruction is on her tongue.\n27 She watches over the activities of her household\nand is never idle.\n28 Her sons rise up and call her blessed.\nHer husband also praises her:\n29 “Many women are capable,\nbut you surpass them all!”\n30 Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting,\nbut a woman who fears the Lord will be praised.\n31 Give her the reward of her labor,\nand let her works praise her at the city gates.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. This picture of a virtuous woman comes to us from an ancient context. What are some present-day comparisons you could make between the woman in this passage and a godly woman today? \n\nQ. How is the woman depicted in this passage different from the women our culture tends to prize?\n\nQ. What does this picture of a virtuous woman reveal about what it means to be a virtuous person, whether man or woman? \n\nQ. If you have a woman like this in your life, how can you tell her before the sun goes down today?\n\n",

Relationships: Wisdom concerning our interpersonal lives\n\nThis week’s proverbs are turning our attention outward to the relationships we have with others. We’re looking at the the wisdom God’s Word gives us concerning parents and children, adultery, correction, and the power of the tongue.\n\nDay Sixteen: Parents and Children \n\nThe last words in the Old Testament, in Malachi chapter 4, tell us that the Messiah will “turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers,” healing what is broken between them (v. 6). Few relationships carry greater room for pain or influence than the parent-child relationship. \n\nThe Book of Proverbs does not assume this relationship is easy, or that its health is automatic. But it does acknowledge that this relationship, potentially more than any other, has the capacity to shape a young person’s life in beautiful and lasting ways. \n\nThe wisdom given here looks very much like what Jesus described as the greatest love there is—one person laying down their life for another (John 15:13). These proverbs shed some light on what that sort of self-sacrifice looks like.\n\nProverbs 10:1\nA wise son brings joy to his father,\nbut a foolish son, heartache to his mother.\n\nProverbs 13:1\nA wise son responds to his father’s discipline,\nbut a mocker doesn’t listen to rebuke.\n\nProverbs 14:26\nIn the fear of the Lord one has strong confidence\nand his children have a refuge.\n\nProverbs 19:18\nDiscipline your son while there is hope;\ndon’t be intent on killing him.\n\nProverbs 22:6\nTeach a youth about the way he should go;\neven when he is old he will not depart from it.\n\nProverbs 22:15\nFoolishness is tangled up in the heart of a youth;\nthe rod of discipline will drive it away from him.\n\nProverbs 30:17\nAs for the eye that ridicules a father\nand despises obedience to a mother,\nmay ravens of the valley pluck it out\nand young vultures eat it.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. Looking back, how did you see the wisdom in these verses modeled for you (or not modeled for you) when you were younger? What can you learn from that now? \n\nQ. Look at Proverbs 10:1. Why do the actions of a child have so much impact on the hearts of his or her parents? \n\nQ. Why does the Bible tell parents to train their children early? \n\nQ. In what ways does the parent-child relationship uniquely cultivate understanding of the gospel in our lives? \n\n",

Relationships: Wisdom concerning our interpersonal lives\n\nThis week’s proverbs are turning our attention outward to the relationships we have with others. We’re looking at the the wisdom God’s Word gives us concerning parents and children, adultery, correction, and the power of the tongue.\n\nDay Seventeen: Adultery\n\nNotice the way this topic, adultery, comes up in Scripture. It is included in the Ten Commandments as a clear statement of Law: “Don’t do this.” But the Book of Proverbs adds a layer of complexity to that law by discussing the sometimes hard-to-detect process often involved in committing this particular sin. \n\nFew people wake up in the morning saying, “Today I am going to commit adultery.” Much of the time, the act of adultery is the product of walking a long and dangerous road of seduction. Sometimes the seductress described in this text is a particular person (man or woman) who tries to lure another person into infidelity. But sometimes the seductress in this passage can be the unchecked longings and unaddressed pains in our own hearts, calling to us from within to succumb to temptation with the promise that it will bring us happiness. \n\nKeep both of these meanings in mind when reading these proverbs about adultery.\n\nProverbs 5:1-17\n5 My son, pay attention to my wisdom;\nlisten closely to my understanding\n2 so that you may maintain discretion\nand your lips safeguard knowledge.\n3 Though the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey\nand her words are smoother than oil,\n4 in the end she’s as bitter as wormwood\nand as sharp as a double-edged sword.\n5 Her feet go down to death;\nher steps head straight for Sheol.\n6 She doesn’t consider the path of life;\nshe doesn’t know that her ways are unstable.\n7 So now, my sons, listen to me,\nand don’t turn away from the words of my mouth.\n8 Keep your way far from her.\nDon’t go near the door of her house.\n9 Otherwise, you will give up your vitality to others\nand your years to someone cruel;\n10 strangers will drain your resources,\nand your earnings will end up in a foreigner’s house.\n11 At the end of your life, you will lament\nwhen your physical body has been consumed,\n12 and you will say, “How I hated discipline,\nand how my heart despised correction.\n13 I didn’t obey my teachers\nor listen closely to my mentors.\n14 I am on the verge of complete ruin\nbefore the entire community.”\n15 Drink water from your own cistern,\nwater flowing from your own well.\n16 Should your springs flow in the streets,\nstreams of water in the public squares?\n17 They should be for you alone\nand not for you to share with strangers.\n\n Ask\n\nQ. Why do you suppose this passage is so personalized and told like a vivid story, as opposed to being a list of reasons why adultery is wrong? \n\nQ. Describe the temptress wooing your heart in this season of your life. \n\nQ. It is interesting that a negative thing (an immoral woman) is compared to a sharp two-edged sword, when the Word of God is also compared to a sharp two-edged sword (Hebrews 4:12). What do they have in common? \n\nQ. What does “Keep your way far from her” mean in Proverbs 5:8? Practically, what are some ways you can do this as it relates to the particular temptation you are facing? \n\n",

Relationships: Wisdom concerning our interpersonal lives\n\nThis week’s proverbs are turning our attention outward to the relationships we have with others. We’re looking at the the wisdom God’s Word gives us concerning parents and children, adultery, correction, and the power of the tongue.\n\nDay Eighteen: Correction\n\nAs followers of Jesus, we are called to humility—to be open to correction from God’s Word, and from people in our lives who love us. \n\nReceiving correction, as with seeking counsel, requires the humility to openly admit that we do not know all there is to know. It also requires the grace to receive what may, at the time, feel like a wound, believing that wounds from a true friend can be trusted. \n\nConsider how these proverbs dealing with correction work to correct you even as you read them.\n\nProverbs 3:12\n[F]or the Lord disciplines the one He loves,\njust as a father, the son he delights in.\n\nProverbs 6:23\nFor a command is a lamp, teaching is a light,\nand corrective discipline is the way to life.\n\nProverbs 9:8\nDon’t rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you;\nrebuke a wise man, and he will love you.\n\nProverbs 11:14\nWithout guidance, people fall,\nbut with many counselors there is deliverance.\n\nProverbs 12:1\nWhoever loves discipline loves knowledge,\nbut one who hates correction is stupid.\n\nProverbs 19:20-21\nListen to counsel and receive instruction\nso that you may be wise later in life.\n21 Many plans are in a man’s heart,\nbut the Lord’s decree will prevail.\n\nProverbs 27:5-6\nBetter an open reprimand\nthan concealed love.\n6 The wounds of a friend are trustworthy,\nbut the kisses of an enemy are excessive.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. From whom do you welcome correction? Why? Who seeks wise counsel from you? Why? \n\nQ. Consider Proverbs 9:8. Describe what a mocker is and does. What motivates them to do so? Are you a mocker? \n\nQ. How would you explain the meaning of Proverbs 27:6 to a friend? What are some wounds good friends have given you in the spirit of this proverb? What do you think the phrase “kisses of an enemy” means?\n\n",

Relationships: Wisdom concerning our interpersonal lives\n\nThis week’s proverbs are turning our attention outward to the relationships we have with others. We’re looking at the the wisdom God’s Word gives us concerning parents and children, adultery, correction, and the power of the tongue.\n\nDay Nineteen: The Tongue\n\nOur words matter. James wrote, “Every sea creature, reptile, bird, or animal is tamed and has been tamed by man, but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. We praise our Lord and Father with it, and we curse men who are made in God’s likeness with it. Praising and cursing come out of the same mouth. My brothers, these things should not be this way” (James 3:7-10). \n\nFew of us probably spend much time considering how we use our words throughout the course of a day. Use this day to pay careful attention to your words, and see what wisdom these proverbs have for you.\n\nProverbs 29:20\nDo you see a man who speaks too soon?\nThere is more hope for a fool than for him.\n\nProverbs 10:11\nThe mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life,\nbut the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.\n\nProverbs 15:1-2\nA gentle answer turns away anger,\nbut a harsh word stirs up wrath.\n2 The tongue of the wise makes knowledge attractive,\nbut the mouth of fools blurts out foolishness.\n\nProverbs 26:4-5\nDon’t answer a fool according to his foolishness\nor you’ll be like him yourself.\n5 Answer a fool according to his foolishness\nor he’ll become wise in his own eyes.\n\nProverbs 31:8-9\nSpeak up for those who have no voice,\nfor the justice of all who are dispossessed.\n9 Speak up, judge righteously,\nand defend the cause of the oppressed and needy.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. Why do our words matter so much? What is it about the way God made us that gives power to words? \n\nQ. Our words can give life and take life. They can bring light or add darkness. How have you given light and life with your words? How have you spoken death and darkness?\n\nQ. Why do you think Proverbs 26:4 and 26:5 are back to back? Is this a contradiction in the Bible, or is there an important principle of wisdom to be found in their being placed beside each other? If so, what is it? \n\nQ. Are there any areas of your life where you know you need to practice the wisdom of Proverbs 31:8-9? \n\n",

Work and Wealth: Wisdom concerning our material world\n\nThis week’s proverbs will turn our attention to biblical wisdom concerning how we interact with the material world. We’ll explore the topics of diligence and laziness, justice, generosity and gluttony, wealth and poverty, and good versus evil.\n\nDay Twenty-Two: Diligence and Laziness\n\nWhen Jesus taught us to pray, He told us to say, “Give us today our daily bread” (Matthew 6:11). Not our monthly or yearly bread, but our daily bread. The instruction to pray for daily sustenance implies that we are meant to always be engaged in the work and provision of life. We are not meant to be workaholics, but neither are we meant to coast. We are called to engage with the life we’ve been given. \n\nGodly diligence is the pursuit of contributing beauty, goodness, and truth in whatever ways we can. Consider how these proverbs help us understand that call.\n\nDiligence\n\nProverbs 4:23\nGuard your heart above all else,\nfor it is the source of life.\n\nProverbs 12:27\nA lazy man doesn’t roast his game,\nbut to a diligent man, his wealth is precious.\n\nProverbs 13:11\nWealth obtained by fraud will dwindle,\nbut whoever earns it through labor will multiply it.\n\nProverbs 22:29\nDo you see a man skilled in his work?\nHe will stand in the presence of kings.\nHe will not stand in the presence of unknown men.\n\n Proverbs 27:23-27\n23 Know well the condition of your flock,\nand pay attention to your herds,\n24 for wealth is not forever;\nnot even a crown lasts for all time.\n25 When hay is removed and new growth appears\nand the grain from the hills is gathered in,\n26 lambs will provide your clothing,\nand goats, the price of a field;\n27 there will be enough goat’s milk for your food—\nfood for your household\nand nourishment for your female servants.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. In what areas of your life are you the most diligent? What does Scripture call us to be diligent about?\n\nQ. Proverbs 4:23 calls us to “guard our hearts.” What does it mean to make caring for your heart a priority? \n\nQ. What are the ways you currently take care of your heart? If you don’t have an answer, what would it look like for you to begin? \n\nLaziness\n\nProverbs 6:6-11\n6 Go to the ant, you slacker!\nObserve its ways and become wise.\n7 Without leader, administrator, or ruler,\n8 it prepares its provisions in summer;\nit gathers its food during harvest.\n9 How long will you stay in bed, you slacker?\nWhen will you get up from your sleep?\n10 A little sleep, a little slumber,\na little folding of the arms to rest,\n11 and your poverty will come like a robber,\nyour need, like a bandit.\n\nProverbs 26:14-16\n14 A door turns on its hinges,\nand a slacker, on his bed.\n15 The slacker buries his hand in the bowl;\nhe is too weary to bring it to his mouth.\n16 In his own eyes, a slacker is wiser\nthan seven men who can answer sensibly.\n\nProverbs 15:19\nA slacker’s way is like a thorny hedge,\nbut the path of the upright is a highway.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. We live in a culture of busy people. Is it possible to be extremely busy and extremely lazy at the same time? Explain. \n\nQ. What does laziness look like in your life? Why is laziness a gospel issue? Why, specifically, is it sinful? \n\nQ. Under the banner of a gracious God, how would you state in the positive the negative command, “Don’t be lazy”?\n\n",

We’ll explore the topics of diligence and laziness, justice, generosity and gluttony, wealth and poverty, and good versus evil.\n\nDay Twenty-Three: Security and Justice \n\nYou have only ever had one provider. One of the most frequent commands in the Bible is, “Do not fear.” This command is less about feeling the sensation of fear and more about what our fear tells us about our view of God. We’re called to live without fear because God, who made us, knows our needs and takes care of us.\n\nOf course, as we’ve already seen in this study, sometimes God’s provision comes in the form of loss, by way of inheriting the natural consequences of our actions. But God calls us to honor Him by trusting in His goodness, rather than our possessions, to give us security.\n\nThese proverbs help us understand security and justice from a biblical perspective. \n\nSecurity\n\nProverbs 1:33\nBut whoever listens to me will live securely\nand be free from the fear of danger.\n\nProverbs 13:6\nRighteousness guards people of integrity,\nbut wickedness undermines the sinner.\n\nProverbs 3:9-10 ESV\nHonor the Lord with your wealth\nand with the firstfruits of all your produce;\nthen your barns will be filled with plenty,\nand your vats will be bursting with wine.\n\nProverbs 4:13\nHold on to instruction; don’t let go.\nGuard it, for it is your life.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. Look at Proverbs 1:33. What benefit is there in listening to God? What is your security? \n\nQ. Why does Scripture talk about giving in terms of “firstfruits” (Proverbs 3:9)? What is the wisdom of giving from the top of our resources as opposed to the bottom? In what ways does giving “firstfruits” combat the power of greed in our hearts? \n\nQ. Look at Proverbs 4:13. What does it look like to “hold on to instruction”? \n\nJustice\n\nProverbs 11:1\nDishonest scales are detestable to the Lord,\nbut an accurate weight is His delight.\n\nProverbs 13:23\nThe uncultivated field of the poor yields abundant food,\nbut without justice, it is swept away.\n\nProverbs 18:13\nThe one who gives an answer before he listens—\nthis is foolishness and disgrace for him.\n\nProverbs. 18:17\nThe first to state his case seems right\nuntil another comes and cross-examines him.\n\nProverbs 22:28\nDon’t move an ancient boundary marker\n\nthat your fathers set up.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. Name a time when you have fallen prey to the sort of folly described in Proverbs 18:13. How does answering without listening contribute to injustice? Why do you think people are so quick to speak confidently about things we don’t fully understand? \n\nQ. What does Proverbs 22:28 have to do with preserving justice? What do you think is the wisdom behind this specific instruction not to move an ancient landmark? \n\nQ. These proverbs tie the plight of the poor to whoever reads these words of God’s wisdom. What does the plight of the poor have to do with you? Why should you care? Why is it wise and godly to care? \n\n",

One makes us sick; one makes others well. \n\nThe true problem with gluttony has less to do with how many calories we take in or how big our waists become. It has to do with our ability to practice the fruit of the Spirit, self-control—an essential component of generosity. Generosity is always an exercise in self-control because it requires us to give when our instinct is to keep. \n\nConsider how these proverbs link gluttony and generosity together, and let their wisdom hold up a mirror for you.\n\nGenerosity\n\nProverbs 3:27-28\n27 When it is in your power,\ndon’t withhold good from the one it belongs to.\n28 Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go away! Come back later.\nI’ll give it tomorrow”—when it is there with you.\n\nProverbs 19:17\nKindness to the poor is a loan to the Lord,\nand He will give a reward to the lender.\n\nProverbs 30:15-16\nThe leech has two daughters: “Give, Give!”\nThree things are never satisfied;\nfour never say, “Enough!”:\n16 Sheol; a childless womb;\nearth, which is never satisfied with water;\nand fire, which never says, “Enough!”\n\nAsk\n\nQ. Why does God care about how we handle our possessions? \n\nQ. Look at Proverbs 30:15-16. Have you ever been bitten by a leech? What about this creature’s process makes it a fitting symbol of greed? \n\nQ. Think of a time you withheld giving to someone, knowing you should have been generous. Why did you withhold your generosity? \n\nGluttony\n\nProverbs 21:17\nThe one who loves pleasure will become a poor man;\nwhoever loves wine and oil will not get rich.\n\nProverbs 23:19-21\n19 Listen, my son, and be wise;\nkeep your mind on the right course.\n20 Don’t associate with those who drink too much wine\nor with those who gorge themselves on meat.\n21 For the drunkard and the glutton will become poor,\nand grogginess will clothe them in rags.\n\nProverbs 25:16\nIf you find honey, eat only what you need;\notherwise, you’ll get sick from it and vomit.\n\nProverbs 28:7\nA discerning son keeps the law,\nbut a companion of gluttons humiliates his father.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. Where are you a glutton—what appetites have a hold on your heart? Why do you think God cares about gluttony? How does gluttony contradict godliness? \n\nQ. What sort of “poverty” do you think is being described in Proverbs 23:19-21? \n\nQ. Proverbs 28:7 tells us there is a relational cost to our own personal gluttony. What does gluttony cost us relationally, and why do you think gluttony works this way? \n\n",

Work and Wealth: Wisdom concerning our material world\n\nThis week’s proverbs will turn our attention to biblical wisdom concerning how we interact with the material world. We’ll explore the topics of diligence and laziness, justice, generosity and gluttony, wealth and poverty, and good versus evil.\n\nDay Twenty-Five: Debt, Wealth, and Poverty \n\nMoney is more than a means to buy the things we need. It is power, and it always has been. This is why the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil (1 Timothy 6:10): it is the love of being able to wield power for our own benefit. \n\nThere is nothing inherently sinful about being wealthy. The Lord gave King Solomon great wealth. And He continues to do this, using the generosity of His people to fund important works of mercy and justice around the world. But God’s people are called to be very careful when it comes to the pursuit and use of wealth, and very generous when it comes to caring for the poor. \n\nConsider the principles of debt, wealth, and poverty raised in these proverbs.\n\nDebt\n\nProverbs 6:1-5\n6 My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor\nor entered into an agreement with a stranger,\n2 you have been trapped by the words of your lips—\nensnared by the words of your mouth.\n3 Do this, then, my son, and free yourself,\nfor you have put yourself in your neighbor’s power:\nGo, humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor.\n4 Don’t give sleep to your eyes\n\nor slumber to your eyelids.\n5 Escape like a gazelle from a hunter,\nlike a bird from a fowler’s trap.\n\nProverbs 11:15\nIf someone puts up security for a stranger,\nhe will suffer for it,\nbut the one who hates such agreements is protected.\n\nProverbs 22:26-27\nDon’t be one of those who enter agreements,\nwho put up security for loans.\n27 If you have no money to pay,\neven your bed will be taken from under you.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. Have you ever financially over-extended yourself? If so, what did that experience teach you? \n\nQ. Isn’t it interesting that the Bible speaks about co-signing for someone else’s loan, or “putting up security for a stranger”? How would you summarize the wise counsel given in these proverbs concerning co-signing? \n\nQ. What is the wise counsel from these verses concerning debt? What does teaching about debt have to do with living in the freedom of the gospel?\n\nWealth and Poverty\n\nProverbs 6:10-11\n10 A little sleep, a little slumber,\na little folding of the arms to rest,\n11 and your poverty will come like a robber,\nyour need, like a bandit.\n\nProverbs 13:7\nOne man pretends to be rich but has nothing;\nanother pretends to be poor but has great wealth.\n\nProverbs 18:23\nThe poor man pleads,\nbut the rich one answers roughly.\n\nProverbs 20:21\nAn inheritance gained prematurely\nwill not be blessed ultimately.\n\nProverbs 22:1-2, 4\n1 A good name is to be chosen over great wealth;\nfavor is better than silver and gold.\n2 The rich and the poor have this in common:\nthe Lord made them both.\n4 The result of humility is fear of the Lord,\nalong with wealth, honor, and life.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. Read Proverbs 13:7. If you were given a million dollars, would you be more likely to blow it on excess or bury it in the ground? What does your answer reveal about your view of wealth? Your view of God? \n\nQ. Look at Proverbs 20:21. What do you think is behind our fascination with gaining instant wealth? \n\nQ. Being as honest with yourself as you can be, do you think you are a person who easily sees the poverty in and around you? Why is poverty so difficult to see? \n\n",

Work and Wealth: Wisdom concerning our material world\n\nThis week’s proverbs will turn our attention to biblical wisdom concerning how we interact with the material world. We’ll explore the topics of diligence and laziness, justice, generosity and gluttony, wealth and poverty, and good versus evil.\n\nDay Twenty-Six: Good and Evil, Faithfulness and Truthfulness \n\nJesus says, “I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. For He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous” (Matthew 5:44-45). Amos 5:15 says, “Hate evil and love good.” These two passages do not contradict each other. They clarify each other. \n\nOne of the profound characteristics of a maturing Christ follower is a desire to live in the tension of hating evil while loving our enemies. In a way, this is the heart of the gospel—Christ came carrying an unwavering disdain for the sin at work in us while maintaining an unwavering love for us. \n\nConsider how these proverbs show us how to live in that tension.\n\nGood and Evil\n\nProverbs 1:10-19\nMy son, if sinners entice you,\ndon’t be persuaded.\n11 If they say—“Come with us!\nLet’s set an ambush and kill someone.\nLet’s attack some innocent person just for fun!\n12 Let’s swallow them alive, like Sheol,\nstill healthy as they go down to the Pit.\n13 We’ll find all kinds of valuable property\nand fill our houses with plunder.\n14 Throw in your lot with us,\nand we’ll all share our money”—\n15 my son, don’t travel that road with them\nor set foot on their path,\n16 because their feet run toward trouble\nand they hurry to commit murder.\n17 It is foolish to spread a net\nwhere any bird can see it,\n18 but they set an ambush to kill themselves;\nthey attack their own lives.\n19 Such are the paths of all who make profit dishonestly;\nit takes the lives of those who receive it.\n\nProverbs 11:3-5\nThe integrity of the upright guides them,\nbut the perversity of the treacherous destroys them.\n4 Wealth is not profitable on a day of wrath,\nbut righteousness rescues from death.\n5 The righteousness of the blameless clears his path,\nbut the wicked person will fall because of his wickedness.\n\nProverbs 14:14\nThe disloyal one will get what his conduct deserves,\nand a good man, what his deeds deserve.\n\nProverbs 25:21-22\nIf your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat,\nand if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;\n22 for you will heap burning coals on his head,\nand the Lord will reward you.\n\nAsk\n\nQ. How often would you say you are caught in an internal struggle between good and evil? \n\nQ. See Proverbs 1:10-19. What does traveling the road of sinners look like for you? \n\nQ. What is Proverbs 25:21-22 saying? What do you think “you will heap burning coals on his head” means? \n\nFaithfulness and Truthfulness\n\nProverbs 3:3-4\nNever let loyalty and faithfulness leave you.\nTie them around your neck;\nwrite them on the tablet of your heart.\n4 Then you will find favor and high regard\nin the sight of God and man.\n\nProverbs 30:5\nEvery word of God is pure;\nHe is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.\n\nProverbs 20:6\nMany a man proclaims his own loyalty,\nbut who can find a trustworthy man?\n\nProverbs 20:17\nFood gained by fraud is sweet to a man,\nbut afterward his mouth is full of gravel.\n\nProverbs 13:5\nThe righteous hate lying,\nbut the wicked act disgustingly and disgracefully.\n\nProverbs 11:13\nA gossip goes around revealing a secret,\nbut a trustworthy person keeps a confidence.\n\nProverbs 25:13\nTo those who send him, a trustworthy messenger\nis like the coolness of snow on a harvest day;\nhe refreshes the life of his masters.\n\nProverbs 25:19\nTrusting an unreliable person in a difficult time\nis like a rotten tooth or a faltering foot.\n\nProverbs 27:6\nThe wounds of a friend are trustworthy,\nbut the kisses of an enemy are excessive.\n\nAsk\n\nQ.

If an unfaithful person is compared to a bad tooth or a busted foot (Proverbs 25:19), to what would you compare a faithful person? Get creative. \n\nQ. Look at Proverbs 13:5. Do you hate lying? What must be true in a person’s heart in order for them to hate lying? \n\nQ. How has Christ epitomized the faithfulness depicted in these proverbs? \n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Song of Love",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Song of Songs 1:1-2:7, Psalm 45:1-17, Isaiah 11:1, 1 Corinthians 13:1-13\n\nI am such a fan of love poetry. At root, all love poetry is aiming for the same thing: connection. Although ancient love poetry has a different flavor than modern love poems, we can see the same longing for intimacy in both.\n\nFor centuries, Song of Songs was primarily read as an allegory for Christ’s love for His Church. And while a purely spiritual interpretation of the poem certainly does seem possible, we can also see from other passages of Scripture that God celebrates married love (Ephesians 5:25), and He values our human connections (John 15:17). So it is safe to read this poem as a human love story, while also noting that we can only love because we are loved by Christ (1 John 4:19). And indeed, in the history of Israel, the theme of marital unfaithfulness is a common one.\n\nAs we look at this poem, it’s helpful to have a little roadmap to give structure and understanding. Many Bible commentators point out that Song of Songs was written using a chiastic structure, meaning the poem sort of mirrors itself when it’s folded in half. So the first day parallels the last day, beginning and ending with an invitation to enjoy a spring day and culminating in the middle with the marriage.\n\nBeyond that, this love story is also structured like a play, with speakers given for each role. As you read, it might be helpful to imagine this as a stage play and see each of the speakers as characters distinct from the others.\n\nAnd finally, we can consider Song of Songs in light of God’s covenant with King David, who was Solomon’s father. God had promised David that his people would be God’s people.\n\nUnfortunately, his son Solomon didn’t have a great reputation when it came to fidelity. But through Solomon’s marriage to Shulamith, she was joined to the same covenant God had promised to David. Once an outsider, she was brought into the fullness of all the blessings afforded to David’s people, and therefore, God’s people. In this way, the poem also illuminates the beauty of God’s covenantal blessings.\n\nThe layers of imagery and complexity are rich indeed. But even without all these tools, we can  look into this intimate love poem between two lovers who lived thousands of years ago and find the truth, goodness, and beauty of the gospel. \n\nHow wonderful that God tells us the story of His love for us not only in commandments, in teachings, in lessons of history, and in the very person of His Son, but also in a love poem. God’s design for love is both intimate and grand in scale, presenting love in the context of marital fidelity and covenantal blessing. The central idea is an intimate tie: “I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine.” He protects us under His banner, and that banner is love (Song of Songs 6:3; 2:4).\n\nIn this Song, God provides us with a rich celebration of faithful love between the bridegroom and the bride. It’s about a couple on their wedding night, and it’s about a God who loves His people more than they can understand. “It is a profound mystery,” the love Christ has for the Church (Ephesians 5:32).\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Invitation to Enjoy a Spring Day",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: Song of Songs 2:8-17, Isaiah 62:5, Ephesians 5:31-33\n\nI had a death grip on my husband for the first decade of our marriage. So desperate was my craving to see us through “till death do us part” that I white-knuckled it in our relationship. I was determined to hold on tight enough for both of us. \n\nBut I could never fully grasp the security I craved so deeply. Holding on that tightly squeezed the love and fun out of our relationship. \n\nSince marriage is ultimately a picture of Christ and the Church, this approach to covenant love has also caused strain in my relationship with Jesus. Always secretly fearful that He would change His mind about me, I have tried to keep us glued together with works well done and duties faithfully fulfilled. \n\nBut as desperation and anxiety couldn’t bolt the door on my marriage, striving couldn’t make Jesus love me more. Through years of tender care and collisions with His Word, I am learning that security flows out of devoted love, not anxious control. \n\nIn Song of Songs, Shulamith is the soon-to-be bride of wise King Solomon, and she has her own need for security. Right before the wedding, she says these words:\n\n“My love is mine and I am his.”\n– Song of Songs 2:16\n\nBut, as Shulamith and Solomon’s love story unfolds, her tone begins to shift. After the wedding she says, “I am my love’s, and my love is mine” (6:3). Then, as Shulamith and Solomon mature into an old, married couple, she says, “I am my love’s and his desire is for me” (7:10). \n\nLet’s drag a magnifying glass over this subtle progression. \n\nAt first, Shulamith’s security is found in knowing that her man belongs to her. Her possession of him is primary; his possession of her is secondary. (As I’ve already mentioned, I’ve seen what this looks like in real life. It’s not pretty.) Then, after the wedding, Shulamith’s possession of Solomon was secondary: “I am my love’s, and my love is mine.” And finally, it’s gone altogether: “his desire is for me.” \n\nIt took decades for the bride in this story to understand that her security did not come from her possession of her groom, but from his devoted love to her. \n\nSong of Songs is much more than a human love story. As is the case throughout Scripture, God uses marriage as an illustration for the love between Himself and His people. God is always represented by the groom and we are always the bride. His love hinges on His faithfulness, not ours. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Night of Separation Before the Wedding",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Song of Songs 3:1-5, 1 Kings 4:20-34, Isaiah 55:1-13\n\nFriends, we are so close to the wedding scene, the main event of this beautiful poem. But first, before he details wedded bliss, Solomon details the night before. After all, before the morning must always come the night. \n\nOut of the entire Song of Songs, this passage might be the one I resonate with most. Many commentaries suggest this portion represents a dream Shulamith has the night before her wedding in which she is separated from her beloved. She resolves to get out of bed and seek after him. The repetitive language shows the desperation of her quest: “I sought the one I love; I sought him, but did not find him… I will seek the one I love. I sought him, but did not find him” (Song of Songs 3:1-2).\n\nThat frustration of knowing what it is like to be united with your love, and then being suddenly separated—it is anxiety-inducing. It is frightening. The night feels dark without him. You feel lost without him, and you are not at rest until you are in his arms again. \n\nThis, I would say, is what most of our time here on earth feels like—like the night before the dawn, the night before the reuniting. We feel afraid and lost and desperate. We feel like something—someone—is missing, and we begin this search until we find it. \n\nChrist, our Beloved, has come and He is coming again. But until He does, the night feels long. \n\nSomething I like about Shulamith’s quest is how focused it is. She is looking for one person and one person only: her beloved. She doesn’t get sidetracked or distracted; she knows her heart only beats for one man. \n\nI cannot say so much for myself. Though I know what I ache and long for is actually my Savior, I have often set off on quests in the wrong direction, believing maybe this relationship or that person’s approval is actually what I need. I spend money on what is not bread and my labor on what does not satisfy (Isaiah 55:2), instead of going to the living water that has promised me life. I get confused in the night and restless, and too often this results in seeking the wrong person, place, or thing. \n\nShulamith eventually finds her love, and when she does, she holds on to him and does not let him go (Song of Songs 3:4). Think about that. When your desperate nighttime quest leads you into the arms of Christ, and you recognize Him as what your soul has been longing for this whole time—as the redemption you are so undeserving of, yet so in need of—you do not let go. You cling to the cross and thank God that the night is almost over and the morning is near. You’ve been reunited with your love, your Savior.\n\nFor now, we cling to Christ in the night. His return has not yet come, but it soon will. And when it does, the final union between us and our Bridegroom will be even more wonderful and holy and beautiful than Solomon’s poetic words can capture. Until then, may we continue our quest in the night, and may it lead us to the arms of Christ. \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Song of Songs 3:6-11, Psalm 144:1-15, Luke 12:22-31\n\nThese are the unforgettable words my best friend chose to exchange with me, her maid of honor, before walking down the aisle:\n\n“Don’t faint up there…or else.”\n\nWhile most would have taken these words as a warning regarding the air conditioning-less chapel we’d soon be standing in for the ceremony, I knew we were both bracing each other for something else. The incoming emotional swell that would accompany this banner day was headed straight for us, and we weren’t quite sure where it would land. Maybe on tear-stained cheeks or sweaty palms, or in the excitement of our hurried steps?\n\nBefore we could manage to prepare for its arrival, it was my turn to walk down the aisle, followed closely by hers. The swell arrived as a flurry of tissues and gasps overcame the guests, each as bewildered as I was by our luck at witnessing such a glorious event. \n\nHer face was ablaze with joy, but the feeling didn’t culminate until I glanced over at the flame’s source—her groom. His stance remained as steady as the stream of tears that fell from his face. It was the day of his heart’s rejoicing, and his joy caused a swell in our own hearts too. \n\nI brace myself with this same kind of anticipation when we get to Song of Songs 3. Scripture tells us the wedding guests participated in Solomon’s own rejoicing as his attendants rose from the wilderness like clouds of smoke and his mother placed a crown on his head. Beauty and nature linked arms for this lavish celebration of love and promise, every detail covered and each onlooker provided for. \n\nI hope the wedding guests didn’t miss it. I hope they turned their heads to behold the groom’s face, the evidence of his heart’s rejoicing. I hope we don’t miss our Groom’s joy, either. As we observe the details of this elaborate wedding day, we may feel like we’re only onlookers of Solomon and Shulamith’s vows. But we forget, the same vows have been made to us by God. \n\n “Consider how the wildflowers grow: They don’t labor or spin thread. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was adorned like one of these! If that’s how God clothes the grass, which is in the field today and is thrown into the furnace tomorrow, how much more will He do for you—you of little faith?”\n-Luke 12:27-28\n\nNot even the day of Solomon’s heart’s rejoicing compares to the way our own hearts rejoice— partly now, in knowing Christ, and fully then, in seeing Christ (1 Corinthians 13:12). This passageway called Earth is the aisle we walk to our perfect love, perfect peace, perfect Prince. May we never take our eyes off Him, acknowledging the way His heart rejoices over His bride. Amen. \n\nHappy are the people with such blessings.\n\nHappy are the people whose God is Yahweh.\n-Psalm 144:15\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Song of Songs 4:1-16, Proverbs 4:23, Revelation 22:1-5\n\nI once had a box of love letters that I kept way past their expiration date.\n\nThe author of the letters was a boy I knew when I was a teenager. We lived in different states, met at a church event, and “dated” – or something? – long distance for a while, seeing each other only a handful of times. This was back when high school kids didn’t have email addresses and dinosaurs roamed the earth, so letter-writing was our primary means of communication. You know—paper and pens, envelopes and stamps. \n\nI kept those letters long after the boy and our young relationship faded away, and thinking back on it, I’m not exactly sure why. It wasn’t because I was pining for the boy himself—I hardly knew him, after all. I think I kept them because of my feelings for feelings.\n\nI liked remembering the anticipation the distance between us created, and the way my stomach did flips each time his handwriting appeared in my mailbox. I liked recalling the connection I felt as I read his letters, even though they were about normal things like school or work or car trouble. (He drove an Acura, my high school dream car. You can see the appeal.)\n\nLove—even faint glimpses of it—forces us to feel. Romantic love awakens our senses, making us keenly aware of our built-in longing for intimacy and connection. Maybe this is one of the reasons God included this human love letter in the middle of His divine love letter to us: to wake us up.  \n\nAs we read today in Chapter 4, Solomon could hardly contain himself when it came to Shulamith. He enthusiastically praised every part of his beautiful bride, comparing her hair to “a flock of goats,” her brow to “a slice of pomegranate”—even rejoicing that she has all her teeth! We roll our eyes at the absurdity of his metaphors because we know his bride was human and imperfect, but at the same time, we get it. Whether we’ve experienced the thrill of romantic love firsthand or just blushed at the thought of it, we can imagine the weightless feeling that comes from a stolen glance, or the electricity of a first kiss.\n\nReading this love song out loud makes me uncomfortable, like I’m eavesdropping on a private conversation. But you know what? It does not shock or embarrass God. He created us for relationship and established boundaries in which those relationships can flourish and honor Him. Solomon is finally joining with his bride, and we don’t have to be embarrassed about it. The Bible celebrates it! \n\nLove, relationships, and yes, even sex, remind us that we are alive—created by a God who loves us, and created to love each other. We misuse and abuse His gifts—and pain, tears, and shame result when we do—but the gifts themselves are good. Solomon is right to rejoice.\n\nLove and its songs are grand, but there is only one love that fulfills our expectations. Christ’s love for the Church has no blemishes or flaws; He never falters or forgets. And while love here on earth comes with its share of heartache and tears, the fulfillment of our heart’s truest desire will not disappoint. “He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There won’t be death anymore. There won’t be any grief, crying, or pain, because the first things have disappeared” (Revelation 21:4).\n\nThere will be no more eye rolling, no more shame—only the ultimate joy and perfect peace that comes from being in the presence of God. We are most alive when we are joined with Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Song of Songs 5:1-16, Psalm 128:1-6, Colossians 3:12-17\n\nLove makes me uncomfortable. It makes me feel vulnerable and exposed, like the whole world can read my innermost thoughts. Love catches me off guard, it clouds my decision-making, it questions my motives. Love causes me to frantically build walls, and then love tears them all down. Love feels risky. I’m uncomfortable with risk.\n\nIn chapter 5 of Song of Songs, our young couple is newly married and experiencing all the highs that come with that emotional milestone. But, as is true with human love, the highs are accompanied with lows, the pendulum of emotion often swinging dramatically between the two.\n\nMany scholars believe this passage to be the description of a dream. So while Shulamith may not literally be searching the street for her love or beaten by the city guards, her vivid description helps us understand her emotional state. Her deep love for Solomon makes her feel euphoria, that “intoxication” with love promoted by the narrator in 5:1, as well as desperation, the lovesickness that comes with these overwhelming feelings (5:8).\n\nThe part that intrigues me most about this passage is what Shulamith does with this range of emotion. She does not camp out in either extreme, but rather chooses to confirm, once again, her love for her beloved. Even amid her emotional struggle, she recounts her bridegroom’s attributes, summing them up in one telling declaration: “This is my love, and this is my friend” (5:16). She returns to and affirms their love, despite the vulnerability it demands.\n\nIs this picture of the “work” of love—this constant turning and returning when emotions run awry—what we expect when we think of love and happiness? I’m not sure it is. Take Psalm 128, for example. Too often when I come to Scripture, I want to sit in a safe place like verse 2: “You will be happy, and it will go well for you.” Great! Let’s stay here, yeah? But the psalmist makes it clear that true happiness is not a destination, a place where we arrive and set up camp. Instead, he exclaims, “How happy is everyone who fears the Lord, who walks in His ways!” (v.1).\n\nHappiness involves a posture of fearing and following God. He is the God who teaches us that love is active, not passive; the God who made the ultimate demonstration of His love by laying down His life for ours (Romans 5:8).\n\nThis world is passing away, and even those vows exchanged between a couple hopelessly in love, like our bride and groom in Song of Songs, aren’t certain (Matthew 24:35). Promises of love and the realities of relationship involve emotional and circumstantial trials, with bright highs and dark lows. Only the vows made by God Himself are certain to last.\n\nThe good news is, God did make vows to us. Those vows are called a covenant, and Christ is our down payment of its fulfillment (2 Corinthians 1:21-22). We can love one another because He loved us first (1 John 4:19).\n\nGod’s love for you and me is more than a feeling; it is a choice. He planned, from the beginning of time, to rescue us from sin and darkness, from false loves and shame. Even in our most intimate of relationships, we rely on Christ’s perfect love to enable us to love—today, and tomorrow, and all the days after that. Thanks be to God.   \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Song of Songs 6:1-13, Psalm 48:1-14, Romans 12:1-2, 12:9-13\n\nThe word “garden” gives me heart palpitations. Although I come from a long line of green thumbs, I only remember to water the plant sitting on my coffee table approximately once every three weeks. The friends who gave it to me as a birthday gift promised it was a low-maintenance variety, heavy on the grace. Unfortunately, I’m heavy on forgetfulness.\n\nWe seem to be doing okay so far, this little plant and me. But the thought of having a whole garden has me pre-grieving the blooms that would be under my care. I did once live across the way from the most wonderful garden—one that made me set aside my preconceived notions and wish for a greener thumb. It was in the center of a thriving artist community, and quickly became my favorite place to gather my people. We spent afternoons sprawled out on blankets, surrounded by those who came to make art with their hands, their paintbrushes, or their conversation.\n\nGod loves to gather His people in gardens, too. And not only that—it’s also where He does His best art, growing up glory as only The Creator God can. From Eden, the garden of sin; to Gethsemane, the garden of suffering; to Golgotha, the garden of victory; and to eternal paradise, or “garden of delight”—we see that clearly, God faithfully waters what He plants. \n\nMatthew Henry tells us, “Christ’s church is a garden enclosed, and separated from the open common of the world; it is his garden, which he has planted as he did the garden of Eden, which he takes care of, and delights in.” I think that was my favorite part about my own neighborhood garden: because someone else delighted in it and cared for it, I could enjoy its beauty. I’m still in awe of that individual who was so fruitful in an area where I was so lacking. \n\nWhile gardens are a recurring theme in Scripture, Song of Songs highlights just how lush and beautiful gardens—and love—can truly be.\n\nMy love has gone down to his garden,\nto beds of spice,\nto feed in the gardens\nand gather lilies.\nI am my love’s and my love is mine;\nhe feeds among the lilies.\n-Song of Songs 6:2-3\n\nThe garden is a delight, but what we see happening inside its walls is even more beautiful. The couple is lavishing honor on one another, making clear their love by the way they hold one another up above themselves. The self-sacrifice of the One who is love does the same for us—His bride, the Church. He cares for us and tends to us, but even more than that, He reconciles us to Himself. \n\nIt was in a garden that paradise was found and lost.\n\nIt was in a garden that we are lost and found.\n\nIn gardens, God calls His Beloved in and teaches us about Himself. He reminds us of the ways He has provided for the soil, so that we might remember He is also tending to our hearts. Only when we learn more about the Gardener and the soil of redemption we’ve been planted in, do we begin to see that our broken seeds of faith will grow into holy and living sacrifices after all (Romans 12:1). \n\nWe are His Beloved, and His faithful love endures forever (Psalm 118:1). Hallelujah. \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Praise of Love",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Song of Songs 7:1-9, Ephesians 5:22-30, Revelation 19:6-10\n\nI have to admit, today’s reading was a hard one for me, and not because of the descriptive language. As it’s been said throughout this study, Song of Songs can be read as an allegorical text—a poem that parallels God’s love for Israel and points toward Christ’s love for the Church. When I read Song of Songs 7:1-9 in light of Ephesians 5:22-30, I noticed a depth to Christ’s love for us that I hadn’t really considered before, and, if I’m being honest, am still grappling with now.\n\nFor some reason, it’s easier to formalize Jesus’ love for us, the Church—to think of Him as a benevolent politician who cares for His people. It’s easier for me to keep Christ’s love at a distance, to imagine Him standing at a podium, rather than by my side. But this is not the type of love we see in Song of Songs. \n\nIf the way Solomon speaks of his bride is any indication as to how Christ views us, His bride, then He’s in no way a distant politician waving to a crowd. What we see in Chapter 7 is a deep, intimate, and passionate affection.\n\nSolomon and Shulamith have been reconciled after a time apart, and upon their reuniting Solomon praises his bride’s body and character. He knows every inch of her, every curve and feature. Not one part of her goes unnoticed, unpraised, or unaccepted. Solomon has nothing to say about Shulamith but adoring words of love, devotion, and awe. She is “the handiwork of a master” (Song of Songs 7:1).\n\nThis is what made me feel uncomfortable while reading these verses. To allow yourself to be loved in this way takes an incredible amount of vulnerability. To be examined and aware of your every flaw and sin, then be told you are the exact opposite of how you see yourself—that you’re actually the beloved and beautiful handiwork of a master—is a truth that can sometimes be harder to live with than the lie of shame.\n\nYet, this is what Christ’s passionate affection means for us. As Ephesians 5 says, “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless” (Ephesians 5:25-27). \n\nBecause of Jesus’ atonement for our sin, this is who we now are: holy, blameless, without stain or wrinkle. \n\nThere is an element in our relationship with Christ that requires great vulnerability from us if we are to fully experience His great love. For the striving, earning, and achieving Christian—as well as the guilt-ridden one—this may be one of the greatest challenges of the Christian life: to let ourselves be loved by Him. To allow Him to examine us and declare us good and right and lovely in His sight. \n\nI wonder what would change in your life and mine if we allowed ourselves to bask in Jesus’ love for us, as Shulamith does in Solomon’s—to just sit in it and learn to accept and embrace it. I wonder how we would see ourselves, those around us, and how it would change our relationship with our Savior. \n\nI pray this is the new truth we walk in today: that we would see the purity and passion in Christ’s affection for us, and that we would walk in confidence as His beloved. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Song of Songs 7:10-8:4, Genesis 3:14-19, Psalm 85:10\n\nWhen asked how he and my grandmother met, my grandfather would tell us, “I came to town and asked where the prettiest girl lived.” The rest, as they say, was history. \n\nAlthough I never learned the actual details of their first date, I can imagine Papa was far more nervous than he’d let on, and that Grandmother had spent the afternoon prior positioning the rollers in her hair just so. I don’t know what they ate for dinner or what jokes made them laugh, but I do know it led to a second date, and that Papa became a regular visitor and eventual husband to the prettiest girl in town. What began as an invitation to dinner became a call and a promise to choose their relationship again and again.\n\nInvitations are exciting, but second invitations are better. In Song of Songs, we see Solomon and Shulamith enjoy a spring day together twice, but much has happened between these two significant days. This is where, if we were to fold Song of Songs in half, the two spring days would serve almost as a call and response. \n\nThe first spring day, in chapter 2, is during courtship—Solomon invites Shulamith to leave her house and enjoy a spring day with him, and concludes with a request to hear her voice (2:14). The second, in chapters 7-8, is during marriage, and this time it’s Shulamith extending the invitation to enjoy a new spring day, concluding with a request for intimacy (8:14).\n\nAren’t you glad Solomon didn’t stop with their “happily ever after” wedding? The second half of this book is filled with the good stuff, the kind of stories their grandchildren got to witness. Shulamith’s invitation is also extended to us, an opportunity to see a past the lavish celebration to what’s next. There, we find that though the lovers find themselves in a “new” spring season, the covenant has come with them, just as they promised. They kept choosing each other.  Self-sacrificing love has built the trustworthy covenant borders in which intimate love can reside. \n\nWe’re not told precisely what kept their love alive day to day. Maybe one offered to do dishes and the other loved to put away laundry. The Song gives us tiny glimpses into their trials, but a little research behind their names may give us a clue as to how their partnership worked. “Solomon” means “peace-giver,” and “Shulamith” means “peace-receiver,” illustrating the active ebb and flow of an intimate relationship. \n\nActive, too, is the relationship between Christ and the Church. He gives peace; we receive it. As Solomon and Shulamith remain belonging to one another in their faithfulness, so we remain Christ’s in His faithfulness to us. \n\n“Faithful love and truth will join together; righteousness and peace will embrace.”\n- Psalm 85:10\n\nGod is actively keeping His promises to us. He continues to invite us into His covenant, reminding us of His faithful love again and again. We’re invited to enjoy fresh mercies and kept promises with Him today, tomorrow, and forever. Thanks be to God. \n\n",

Can you remember a time you blushed with delighted surprise? Sometimes I blush over gifts and sometimes I blush about compliments, but my cheeks were at their rosiest when I first met my love. There’s a certain look he used to give me that told me he was utterly slain by me—and, oh, how it made my cheeks burn. The surprises of love, the power of love, and love’s delights are the sweetest things I have ever experienced.\n\nGod didn’t have to allow us to fall in love with each other. I imagine that we could theoretically procreate, carry on the species, and get our jobs done without love. But God is love, and He gave us the subtle delights of love to hold all of life’s pieces together. Love elevates the mundane to magical. \n\nEarly on in our relationship, I remember us sitting in a car together; we talked and he touched my fingers—that was all. But when the car door opened for me to get out, I literally fell on the ground, I was so incapacitated. God didn’t have to let us fall ridiculously in love with each other. But He made us for love!\n\nSong of Songs makes me blush. In fact, it makes me blush like a wedding night makes us blush—at the surprise and joy of intimacy.\n\nThere are two beautiful parallels between Christ as the bridegroom to the Church and the husband as bridegroom to his bride that stand out: People who love each other desire time together, and they pursue that time with one another in spite of obstacles.\n\n“A huge torrent cannot extinguish love.” Have you ever longed to be with your beloved? We desire that Christ will write our name on His heart and in His book. He has done this, saying, “look, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands” (Isaiah 49:16). And He invites us to write His name as a seal on our own hearts (Song of Songs 8:6-7).\n\n“Rivers cannot sweep it away.” Have you ever loved in spite of obstacles? Just as the pains of disappointed love are like a death, the love of Christ for the Church is as strong as death. Our love for Christ makes us dead to everything else. Indeed, we cannot be separated from the love of Christ even by death (Romans 8:38, Song of Songs 8:7).\n\nWithout love we have nothing (1 Colossians 13:1). God’s intimate adoration cannot be bought or traded; we can’t earn it. It is impossible, inexplicable, and overwhelming. Just like falling in love.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Daniel: Introduction",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI like to think of myself as the Domestic Empress of my home. Seven of us live here, but deep down I know this old place never truly lights up and sings unless I’m here. This house is my kingdom, and I preside with varying degrees of justice, mercy, and basil-scented floor cleaner. We each feel like we are the center of our own world, and I’m sure my husband has some equally-exalted secret title for himself.\n\nIt’s like the children’s game “King of the Mountain”—each child clamors and grasps to be the one at the top of the heap. We want to build our tower to heaven to prove that we are the best, and we’ve been doing it for all of human history.\n\nLong ago, before the flood, before Joseph’s coat, and before Abraham’s covenant, Nimrod— “the first powerful man on earth”— established Babel (Genesis 10:8-10). “Now the whole earth had one language and one speech… and they found a plain in the land of Shinar” (Genesis 11:1-2). There they built a tower, a stairway to heaven, but God confused their languages and they scattered before it could be completed. The Tower of Babel fell into ruins until many years later, when King Nebuchadnezzar used that very place to build his city of Babylon, symbolically putting on the old tyrannical culture of Nimrod: whatever they saw, they took (Genesis 6:2).\n\nBabylon was founded amidst this culture of usurpation. Even their mythology relied on one god usurping another god in a fruitless chain of hostile takeovers. The Mesopotamian culture promised no hope of an afterlife, so their only consolation lay in achieving lasting fame through conquest and exploit.\n\nGod’s chosen people, Judah, found themselves a tiny pawn in this Mesopotamian world of usurpation. In 606 BC, the Babylonians captured Judah, and Daniel was included in this first captivity. Afterward, the Medo-Persians toppled the Babylonians, but they were later destroyed by the Greeks under Alexander the Great. Finally, the Greek empire fizzled out and gave way to Rome.\n\nGod’s people were tossed back and forth under enemy rulers and in camps of exile. They struggled to obey God’s laws and maintain their Jewish heritage while living like strangers in strange lands. Obedience and preservation of culture in exile are the big themes for the book of Daniel.\n\nAs we dig into this book and read familiar stories (Daniel in the Lion’s Den! I’m so excited!) and strange unfamiliar passages (What in the world are the seventy sevens?), bear in mind that these people were struggling to hold on to their identity in a world where the rulers seemed both petty and all-powerful. Reading scripture on our smartphones in coffee shops, it’s possible to overlook our connection with the people of Israel in the 6th century BC. But the lion’s dens of the 21st century are very real.  \n\nThe reality is that you and I are exiles too. Even though we know who wins all the wars and who triumphs over all the kingdoms, the here and now can get pretty hairy. We live in a climate that is hostile to the culture of the Gospel (1 Peter 1:1). The reason Daniel is so remarkable is that he held firm and didn’t give way to eating the king’s food and submitting to the ban on prayer. He is remarkable because his heart, like ours, was naturally hostile to the way of the Gospel. It is easy to give way to pagan culture when we are at war within our own selves, and our sinful nature loves to let the difficult work of following God slip away.\n\nWhen we are faithful and when we are faithless, our God reigns. Whatever the circumstances we find ourselves in, He is the one true King. “For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom is from generation to generation” (Daniel 4:34b).\n\nAs we study this book, may we, like Daniel, yield our hearts to God’s Word instead of giving way to the temptation and persecution of our world.\n\n",

A gospel that does not call me to relationship with God is no gospel at all.  \n\nAs we read yesterday in 2 Kings, the people of Israel were in an ongoing battle. But this battle was not just between the kingdom of Babylon and the wayward kings of Judah. The battle was for the hearts of men and women—for the hearts of the very children of God.\n\nThe people of Israel were in exile. Their temple had been burned and their religious symbols desecrated. Hananiah, however, didn’t seem overly concerned. Rather than calling the people to faith and repentance, he gave them a truthless pep talk.\n\nBut Jeremiah knew better. He had heard the words of the prophets who had come before him, warning that there would be consequences to their rebellion against a holy God. Jeremiah understood there was a problem to be acknowledged, a work to be done in the waiting, a faith to be lived out.\n\nWhile Hananiah’s false prophesy presented the notion of a detached God and an “everything’s going to be ok” gospel, Jeremiah’s revealed the promise of the God who pursues, engages and rescues— the God who doesn’t simply replace what sin and its consequences burn away, but who restores the very heart of the sinner. As the people of Israel sat weeping by the waters of Babylon as they remembered their homeland (Psalm 137:1), they were not forgotten by their God. They were called back and gathered up.\n\nJeremiah’s God is Daniel’s God, calling for His people to return, inviting them to repentance, and promising full restoration in His perfect time.\n\nYou will call to Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart. I will be found by you”—this is the Lord’s declaration—“and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and places where I banished you”—this is the Lord’s declaration. “I will restore you to the place I deported you from.”\n\nJeremiah 29:12-14\n\nFriends, as we move forward into the book of Daniel and discover the parallels between his exile and our own, may we remember this call from the Lord. May Daniel’s story give us a new lens through which to see the good news of the Gospel. And as we see Daniel stand firm, actively clinging to his faith in a hostile culture, may we remember that Christ is the greater Daniel, the most faithful exile of all.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nHow important is a name?\n\nThink about it for a minute: If you are a parent, you probably gave a lot of thought to what you would name your children, didn’t you? Or, maybe you’ve named a pet, a company, a blog post, or a boat. If you’ve been married, I bet changing (or not changing) your last name took some getting used to. (Be honest—how many checks did you have to throw away because you signed your “old” last name on them?) I know a family who built a new house on a new street and were actually tasked with naming their street. No pressure. It only took them two months to agree on something.\n\nA name means a lot, doesn’t it? Maybe because it feels permanent. Maybe because names are such an enormous part of our identity. But, I would venture to say, as important as names are to us now, names were even more important to Daniel and crew then.\n\nHow do I know this? Because names are a serious theme throughout biblical history. In the culture of the Ancient Near East, a name was an indicator of a person’s character. Angels appeared in dreams to name John the Baptist (Luke 1:13), Isaac (Genesis 17:19) and Jesus (Luke 1:31). When Jacob had an encounter with the Lord, his name was changed to Israel (Genesis 32:28). Abram and Sarai became Abraham and Sarah after the Lord promised they would be the patriarch and matriarch of many nations (Genesis 17:5,15).\n\nAnd let us not forget, the Name above all Names (Philippians 2:9). The name that is not to be taken in vain (Exodus 20:7). The Name at which every knee should bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (Phil 2:10-11).\n\nSo, yes. Names are a big deal. And changing names is an even bigger deal—particularly for these “good-looking” Jews plucked out of Jerusalem to be trained to serve in the king’s court.\n\nCheck this out:\n\n\n\n(I know. I love a good chart, too.)\n\nEach of the four Jewish exiles were given names by their fathers which relate with the one, true God. But, as a part of their acculturation—in order to make them forget the God of their fathers—the chief official gave them new names that reject their upbringing and instead savor the idolatry of false gods.\n\nOf course translations of the names will vary slightly from commentary to commentary, but look at the wildly intentional similarities! Matthew Henry says the name changes were intended to “wean them from the [religion of their fathers] and instill [that of their conquerors] into them.”\n\nAs temporary residents of a foreign land, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah involuntarily found themselves in a true identity crisis—how can we serve God and Babylon? Is that even possible?\n\nNebuchadnezzar did everything he could conceive of to “take the Jerusalem out of the Jews,” but as we will see in the coming chapters, it will go nothing like he’d hoped. These faithful men will remain steadfast in the midst of a cultural cesspool of idolatry. But I guess that’s getting ahead of things a bit…\n\nFor now, let’s ask ourselves:\n\nHow different is the Babylonian exile from where we stand today?\n\nAre you struggling to serve both the true God and a false god?\n\nIn what ways might we be expecting others to do the same?\n\nWhat is your “identity crisis?” What does God say about how we should conduct ourselves and why? (Read 1 Peter 2:11-12)\n\n“They are focused on earthly things, but our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He will transform the body of our humble condition into the likeness of His glorious body, by the power that enables Him to subject everything to Himself.”\n- Philippians 3:19-21\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nI have two main types of sin in my life. One is the white-knuckle kind of sin that requires gritting my teeth through every second of the temptation, and still, I often fall victim to it in the end. Because if I’m honest, deep down I don’t want to not do this type of sin.\n\nThe other type of sin is the kind I sort of breeze by, compared to the white-knuckle version. This is the kind of sin I hate most. I’ve been there, done that! I know what it does to my relationship with God, and I simply don’t want it this time. God has entered my heart on this issue and given me motive to obey. I have a conviction stronger than my own resolve—I have godly determination.\n\nThis is what Daniel had when King Nebuchadnezzar ordered him to eat a diet that went against Jewish law, including non-Kosher meats and wine that was used as an offering to Babylonian gods. \n\nScripture says, “Daniel determined that he would not defile himself” (Daniel 1:8). So he asked a guard watching over him and his three pals to feed them vegetables and water instead, and the guard agreed. After only ten days, it was apparent that Daniel and his friends were stronger and in better shape than the men who had fed on the king’s rich diet.\n\nLet’s not get side-tracked here. These verses in scripture are not a diet plan for you. They are not an argument for vegetarianism. They are much richer than that. So before you clean out your fridge, let’s feed off of some deeper truth found here.\n\nVerse eight says Daniel was “determined.” The translation of “determined” in this context means “set upon his heart.” This was not a white-knuckle resolve. This determination of Daniel’s was a godly conviction. It was not Daniel’s remarkable willpower (I mean, I would take a burger over vegetables any day) that allowed him to stand strong; it was God working in him and through him.\n\nThis is good news for us. I think we can often look at the story of Daniel and compare ourselves to him. Wow, I would never be brave enough to stand up for my convictions like that. I wish I could be as strong as he was. Then we hang our heads and sulk away.\n\nBut Daniel is not the point of the book of Daniel. Look at verse nine: “God had granted Daniel favor and compassion from the guard.” \n\nWho granted Daniel favor and compassion from the guard? God. God did!\n\nAnd that is the point. God had a plan that he accomplished through his faithful servant Daniel. Because of God, Daniel remained true to his faith and was set apart in the kingdom, even in captivity.\n\nI don’t think Daniel would have ever survived Babylon if he had tried to white-knuckle his way through those years. And I don’t think our souls can survive if we’re trying to white-knuckle our way through own lives. Just as Daniel lived, so do we: by God’s strength, by God’s grace and for God’s plan.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nMy dog will do anything for green beans, hot dogs or chocolate. Even together. I know. Chocolate is terrible for dogs, I know. Before you begin to think I’m the worst pet owner, I promise I do not serve my dog any of these things purposely.\n\nOkay, maybe once or twice, but only when times are hard.\n\nWhen she had a bellyache and wouldn’t eat anything for days, green beans did the trick. When she’d run away down the street, the only thing that would send her galloping back was my voice yelling “HOT DOG!” (Or maybe it was my classy demeanor. Who knows?) And the chocolate? The only thing the dog could hunt was a Reese’s peanut butter cup.\n\nSo, when I think of obedience, I think of my dog. She isn’t the most well-mannered, but girl knows how to get what she wants.\n\nPuppy obedience school runs on a principle our human hearts know too well:\n\nIf ______, then _______.\n\nIf you sit, stay and roll over, then you’ll get a treat.\n\nIf you run, hydrate and eat well, then you’ll lose weight.\n\nIf you read, study and work hard, then you’ll ace the test.\n\nAs we read about the young men at the end of Daniel 1, the same seems to be happening. They have probably prayed, listened, kept faith and now they are blessed! But see, when I hear that, my heart fills in the blanks for me: If I pray harder, obey more and read the Bible, then I’ll be blessed. I begin to confuse blessing with a means to getting what I want, and I’m left feeling defeated.\n\nHere’s the thing: our failure to perfectly follow Christ has already been defeated on the Cross. The connection between faith and works can become muddled and sticky, especially when we involve our own sinful, yet well-intentioned, minds to straighten it out. However, we can rest assured that, from God’s holy perspective, faith and works are never in opposition because His design for both is purposeful and good. Daniel and his friends didn’t follow a prescribed regimen for holiness. By God’s grace, they humbled themselves as His servants, so He would exalt them at the proper time (1 Peter 5:6).\n\nWhen my dog isn’t running away for prepackaged meat treats, she spends the other half of her time perusing my closet. Other than maybe catching my contagious love for fashion, I don’t know where she learned this, because I absolutely did not teach it to her. Especially the part where she likes to welcome guests with a presentation of my dirty laundry.\n\nEach day, she picks items of clothing, sinks her teeth gently into the fabric and parades it downstairs to her favorite spot. She sits in her scented souvenir pile each day, never hurting it, only lounging. Now that I think of it, this too, is my fault.\n\nBecause I leave my closet door cracked slightly, she can push it open with her nose.\n\nBecause I feed and love her, she wants to surround herself with my scent.\n\nBecause I allow this to happen, she can go straight to the reward, without an “if” or “then.”\n\nThe same is true for us.\n\nOur obedience is always and only prefaced by God’s goodness and grace to us. The only “if, then” statement in the Bible we need to worry about is the one that was completed by Jesus—He turned our “if” into a “because”!\n\nBecause we are in Christ, we get to seek first the reward: the Kingdom of God!\n\nBecause we are in Christ, our obedience is no longer driven by lack but by taking joy in The Giver!\n\nBecause we are in Christ, His blessings are given with specific Kingdom purposes.\n\nBecause we hold this as truth, we get to obey him by fearing the Lord and worshipping Him faithfully with all of our hearts (1 Samuel 12:24).\n\nFriends, whether in exile or eating chocolate, we can only obey because of God’s grace.\n\nMay our obedience flow from the reward we already have in Christ. Amen.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nMy reign as a bossy big sister began at two-years-old.\n\nI was all corkscrew curls and chubby cheeks, and I was thrilled over my new brother’s birth—or rather, my rise in ruling status to that of “big sis.” Upon returning from the hospital, my mom rocked the blue bundle that was baby brother while my dad cradled a cake, the celebratory centerpiece of our party of three-turned-four.\n\nDad turned on the video camera to capture the occasion, but my attention had already been taken by the yellow and green flowers on the cake. Were they real? A bouquet of flowers on a cake? I had to find out!\n\nMy eyes gleamed with delight as I seemingly reached for my baby brother, but instead took a sharp nosedive into the lovely bouquet of of flowers that, whaddya know, came straight from a tube of icing. The whole scene was captured on camera: horrified toddler, messy hands, confused parents, screaming baby.\n\nI continued to establish my dominance as bossy big sis throughout toddlerdom, but I didn’t get any better at ruling. In fact, one day I decided to extend my authority to the preschool playground by announcing my attack on the nearby anthill. Armed with my weapon of choice (light-up sneakers), I began to stomp on the anthill, yelling all the fight words I had learned from The Lion King. You can guess how that turned out.\n\nMy power was limitless in my own imagination, but in reality I was easily defeated by my own weaknesses— like my notions of grandeur on the playground and my insatiable love for cake.\n\nNebuchadnezzar had some notions of grandeur of his own. Arguably the most powerful man of his time, the Babylonian king had the world at his fingertips—which is why he could say things like this: “If you don’t tell me [my] dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be made a garbage dump” (Daniel 2:5). Yikes.\n\nNebuchadnezzar’s dream in question, in Daniel Chapter 2, did more than confound the king; it exposed his vulnerabilities. Daniel—relying on wisdom from the Lord, the true King—interprets Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, explaining that the large statue made of various metals represented the four dominant kingdoms at the time: Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Grecian and Roman. Daniel also explained the dream’s punchline: all these powerful, earthly kingdoms would crumble under the kingdom of God.\n\nThose listening, the mighty king himself included, must have thought this sounded like crazy talk! In the midst of rising and falling kingdoms, they couldn’t comprehend a time where not one of the competing powers was on top. The constant need to gain and maintain power was their utmost goal, but it was also their greatest weakness. Daniel, however, spoke of a different kind of power, one that was not of this earth and would never falter. “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed” (Daniel 2:44).\n\nEarthly power will never reverse our inherent flaws. We’ll see Nebuchadnezzar continue to learn this difficult lesson. Our weakness ultimately cannot be strengthened by anything on this earth—not power, not position, not morality, not our own attempts at justification— only Christ (Romans 4:25).\n\nApart from the Kingdom of God, we’re just playing Goldilocks in temporary realms, trying to find a place where our sin fits just right. Unless we house our souls in the Everlasting Kingdom of Heaven— the Kingdom ruled by the God who reveals all mysteries (Daniel 2:28)— we’ll always walk away with messy hands, a false sense of control, and possibly a whole lotta ant bites.\n\nFriends, let this be our cry today, as we proclaim from the bottom of our weakness our allegiance to Christ the King and His Kingdom:\nOn Christ, the solid rock, I stand;\nAll other ground is sinking sand,\nAll other ground is sinking sand.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nIt was 1940, and the German Wehrmacht had the British Expeditionary and French forces surrounded at Dunkirk, on the northern coast of France. The British Navy couldn’t rescue them, and they couldn’t fight their way out. It looked like no one was going to survive.\n\nThe British and French would be safe if they could just get across the English Channel and out of France. But there was no time or resources to stage an evacuation. A British officer sent a three-word telegram to the war offices in London:\n\n“But if not…”\n\nThis powerful phrase communicated to the people at home the true straits of the men stranded at Dunkirk: As with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, the situation looks hopeless, and we pray God will save us. But if not, we will still be faithful.\n\nUnder the cover of fog and night, in small fishing boats, pleasure cruisers, and all manner of small watercraft, piloted by the good people who lived on that coast, 338,000 men were saved.\n\nThe testimony of those three brave men stepping into Nebuchadnezzar’s furnace still looms large in our collective imagination, and their words still have the power to teach us. Thankfully, God protected those three men from the flames—and the troops at Dunkirk—but both were prepared to die. They knew we serve a God who is greater than kings and armies. Though the powers of this world threaten us, taunting, What god will be able to rescue you from my hand?, we serve the God who can save.\n\nGod doesn’t promise to save us from the flames. But He has promised to be with us as we walk through the fire— and either to rescue us in this life, or through death for our eternal salvation (Isaiah 43).\n\nThat’s both comforting and scary, right? Those brave words spoken by brave men sound amazing, but I’m a little nervous when it comes to getting my own hair singed.\n\nLord, give us confidence in your words. Forge courage for us in the midst of a hostile world. Steel our nerves for long, hard days of quiet faithfulness. Resolve our hearts to follow you in momentous decisions and small choices. Build in us a brave resistance to evil.\n\nThen, when the day of testing comes, we can bravely go in the fire and know that whether we live or die, we serve a God like no other—a God who is able to save.\n\nBut if He does not, we will serve Him still.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nI blame reality television.\n\nAnd I don’t just mean just reality TV shows—I mean reality TV shows, and cable news, and YouTube, and Twitter, and Instagram and every other 21st century wonder that tricks me into believing I’m qualified to judge someone I’ve never even met. I’m never quite as irritable as when I’m watching people do things I cannot even begin to understand, much less justify or defend. And yet I can’t turn away! It’s the proverbial train wreck going on all around us—noisy and graphic and consuming and we just can’t stop looking.\n\nObviously technology isn’t really to blame here. I’m a grownup, and I make my own decisions. I decide what I will consume and how I will respond. But I’m a sinful grownup. And I know my saved-by-grace-alone self enough to know it could just as easily be me on the other end of that unfortunate YouTube video gone viral or that reality show that’s unbearable to watch.\n\nGrace is the great leveler — we all need it, heaping amounts of it, all the time.\n\nWhat am I really saying when I write off another person in my heart? Am I saying they’re beyond repair, that they’re not worth waiting for, praying for, hoping for? Am I saying the Gospel isn’t big enough for them, that God’s arms of compassion and grace aren’t long enough to reach them?\n\nWere I Daniel, I would have thought all those things about Nebuchadnezzar. As a person who knew the God Nebuchadnezzar didn’t, such destructive choices would have been tough to watch.\n\nI mean, look at this guy: when he wasn’t spending his time expanding his kingdom, he was admiring it, worshipping it, and ordering others to do the same. He was changing men’s names to what HE thought they ought to be, fitting what he saw as the square peg of their unimportant existence into the round hole of his own, selfish worldview. For crying out loud, he nearly had people killed for not being able to describe his own dreams back to him! Had a licensed psychologist been handy, I’m pretty sure ole Nebu would have been diagnosed with Grade A narcissism.\n\nEnter the God of Israel. The God who sees, pursues, loves, forgives. With the one, true God on the scene, not even the narcissistic king was a lost cause.\n\nIt started with a dream. Nebuchadnezzar has another inexplicable dream, and he calls Daniel in to interpret it. So Daniel does, explaining that Nebuchadnezzar himself was the magnificent tree and that God was going to humble him in a dramatic and effective way.\n\nWhat happens next is the stuff not even reality TV shows are made of — the king very literally goes crazy, becoming like the wild animals and beasts of the field. Nebuchadnezzar is humbled to the point of losing himself completely, but when his sanity is restored, his spirit is also restored.\n\nBut at the end of those days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my sanity returned to me. Then I praised the Most High and honored and glorified Him who lives forever:\n\nFor His dominion is an everlasting dominion,\nand His kingdom is from generation to generation.\n(Daniel 4:34)\n\nThis is an exclamation point moment! The king who had the whole world at his fingertips bows low before the God of heaven and proclaims, “All the inhabitants of the earth are counted as nothing” before the Most High King (Daniel 4:35). Counted as nothing! This, coming from a man who most definitely prized being counted as something.\n\nIn a remarkable example of God’s boundless goodness and grace, Nebuchadnezzar is transformed from destructive pride and self-exaltation to restorative humility. And our response should be? Praise be to the King of Heaven! “All His works are true and His ways are just. He is able to humble those who walk in pride” (Daniel 4:37).\n\nFriend, you and I need God’s grace and Christ’s sacrifice just as much as anyone else on this vast, sinner-filled earth. When we are caught up in the confusion and noise around us, unable to look away from those our hearts are prone to judge, may we remember the beautifully disarming image of pompous king Nebuchadnezzar returning from the field to praise the God of heaven. And may we pray:\n\nFather, capture the hearts of those lost in kingdoms of their own making — ourselves included — and seize our affections for you and you alone, the only true King. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Vivian Mabuni\n\nI learned to read with lightening speed the small print on the back of every type of packaged food. My daughter’s food allergies prevented her from eating soy, eggs, dairy and peanuts. Though the foods took on different shapes and flavors, those possibly life-threatening ingredients managed to make their way into what seemed like everything.\n\nIn today’s Daniel reading, we are introduced briefly to the pride-filled king, Belshazzar. His irreverent act of drinking from the gold and silver cups, sacred vessels—made by Solomon (1 Kings 7:48-51) and later taken from the Jerusalem Temple by Nebuchadnezzar (2 Chronicles 36:10)— smacks of sacrilegious arrogance.\n\nWe find woven in Scripture three similar themes or ingredients of sin. John warns against loving the world’s system and summarizes the sin in three parts: lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride of life (1 John 2:15-17).\n\nThe same ingredients appear in the very first act of disobedience in Genesis, when Adam and Eve eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Take a look at Genesis 3:6: “The woman saw that the tree was good for food” (lust of the flesh), “and that it was pleasant to the eyes” (lust of the eyes), “and a tree…to make one wise” (pride of life).\n\nJesus, when tempted by Satan in the wilderness after fasting 40 days, faced the same three opportunities to sin. Look at Matthew 4:3-8: Satan said to Jesus, “Command that these stones be made bread” (lust of the flesh). He showed Jesus “all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory” (lust of the eyes). He also mocks Him, saying, “throw Yourself down. For it is written, He will give His angels charge concerning you” (pride of life).\n\nBelshazzar, after the terrifying appearance of the hand, offers anyone who can decipher the writing on the wall similar ingredients of the world’s system: pleasures, possessions, and position (Daniel 5:7,16). But these things are ultimately hollow; when we put our trust in them, we are found wanting. The writing on the wall says as much (Daniel 5:26-27).\n\nSin looks different from person to person, but it is rooted in the same self-focused pride we see in Belshazzar. Like those pesky food ingredients my daughter must avoid, evidence of sin seems to be everywhere we turn. Our sinful hearts are bent toward pride and self-sufficiency, but God’s truth offers freedom.\n\nSisters, our perspective is renewed as we invest in reading and studying God’s Word. Note how Jesus responded when tempted in the wilderness: “It is written…” He continually looked to His Father and His Word for strength and sustenance. Our hearts become recalibrated to True North as we lift our eyes off of self and circumstances. When we trust God with our very life-breath, we can stand firm in the knowledge that He controls the whole course of our lives (Daniel 5:23b).\n\nFather, help us. Lift our eyes off our circumstances and our hollow pursuits. Renew our minds through Your Word. Help us to see You clearly and know You more intimately. Help us walk in Your ways, filled with Your Spirit, with hearts surrendered and lives wholly Yours. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nLong before he was ever thrown into the lions’ den, Daniel’s enemies had been on the prowl, circling him (1 Peter 5:8). The local leaders and high officials, whom the king had given Daniel authority over, were thirsty for his blood. These “devouring lions” were evil men who sought to destroy Daniel and the growing success he’d found, though they could find no fault in his character or person (Daniel 6:4-5).\n\nBut Daniel’s faith was steadfast and reflected the character of his God, so much so, the evil men believed it to be a snare. Dizzy with jealousy and afraid of losing power, they plotted to bring him down because of his dedication to the Lord.\n\nSometimes our faithfulness brings us promotion in the world, just as Daniel found increasing favor with the king (Daniel 6:3). Other times, our faithfulness makes us public enemy number one. As Paul notes in his first letter to Timothy, “Everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted” (1 Timothy 3:12).\n\nBut God does not abandon us in our battles. He invites us into prayer. Prayer intersects our humanity with His holiness; it’s where we ask courageously, wait patiently, and surrender faithfully to the roar of God’s goodness. So it was with Daniel. He remained faithful to God in prayer even as the king signed an ordinance condemning those who would petition (pray) to any other “god” but himself for 30 days.\n\nThirty days—not forever, but long enough for Daniel’s enemies to hang him by a spiritual loophole. But Daniel’s faith, the very faith they were hoping would bring about his demise, had been strengthened through years of a daily rhythm of prayer and thanksgiving. So when the king’s edict went out, Daniel was utterly unrattled.\n\nWhen Daniel learned that the document had been signed, he went into his house. The windows in its upper room opened toward Jerusalem, and three times a day he got down on his knees, prayed, and gave thanks to his God, just as he had done before. (Daniel 6:10)\n\nFor Daniel, it was business as usual. He knew his God was greater than any earthly king and, ultimately, victorious in every situation. So, turning his face toward home, he did what he’d always done: Daniel got down on his knees to pray and thank the Lord.\n\nAs for those actual lions in the pit with Daniel, they were turned into lambs—gentle, tamed, and silenced in the presence of God’s power and protection. Daniel’s God had delivered His faithful servant and made His glory known to an unbelieving nation. But make no mistake: it was God’s power that prevailed, His power closed their mouths.\n\nThe God who rescued Daniel is the same God who rescues us. Scripture tells us that Jesus is the Lion of Judah who becomes the Lamb of God (Revelation 5:5-6). He took our pain and suffering upon Himself, “was pierced for our transgressions, and crushed for our iniquities” (Isaiah 53:4-5). And then He arose from the pit victorious!\n\nFriends, when we suffer in the name of Jesus, we do not suffer alone. Jesus assures us this world will bring trouble, but He comes to bring us peace (John 16:33). We will never face a lion’s den without the Lion of Judah by our side.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nGrowing up as a pastor’s daughter, my church was like my own personal playground. My sisters and I spent many hours there and we knew each hallway, back staircase, and classroom. We used to play in the closet where the felt figures and flannel boards were kept for Sunday school. I remember sticking felt Daniel to the board with the felt lions. I remember Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and the little felt fire.\n\nHowever, I do not recall there being a felt version of the bear-like beast holding three ribs between his teeth or a beast with ten little horns, one of which had little eyes. Those were mysteriously missing from our church’s felt-figure collection.\n\nThis is probably because the felt-figure manufacturing company knew that no Sunday school teacher in his right mind would be teaching on the prophecies of Daniel to small children. Daniel himself was afraid of the visions he saw (Daniel 7:15).\n\nCan you imagine what a five-year-old would tell her mom after being picked up from class? “Mommy! We learned about beasts and rivers of fire and giants who stepped on everybody and HORNS!”\n\nChapter 7 of Daniel marks a notable shift in this book, a shift from historical account to end-times prophecy, or, what theologian types call “apocalyptic literature.” Sounds fun, right? Ok, I know, I know. There’s no way around it—chapter seven is when the book of Daniel gets weird.\n\nWeird, but not un-interpretable and not impossible. Scripture does not include dreams and visions to throw us off or confuse us. The prophecies of Daniel are purposeful and, ultimately, hopeful.\n\nWe can break down Daniel’s dream in this chapter into three parts:\n\n The four beasts\n The Ancient of Days\n The Son of Man\n\nThe Ancient of Days is God, and He is holding the book of judgment, which makes me squirm a little. The Son of Man is Jesus. And the four beasts symbolize four kingdoms: Babylon and Medo-Persia (who both ruled during Daniel’s day), Greece, and the last beast, which represents a more general kind of evil, an evil that has been present throughout all of history and continues to reign today. (I encourage you dig into that last one on your own, because it is really, really interesting!)\n\nThe part when Jesus arrives on the scene gives me chills. Until He shows up, everything in the vision is terrifying and warlike and confusing. The beasts, the horns—utter chaos. Then, the scene quiets down, the Son of Man arrives on a cloud and approaches the throne of the Ancient of Days. All eyes turn toward Him. The narrative focuses on Christ.\n\nJesus interrupts a world gone awry.\n\nHe did this with His birth, and He will do it again in the Second Coming. This is why Daniel 7 and the chapters that follow matter so much for us. The prophecy, friends, is not over. We live in the midst of it. Jesus came once, and He is coming again, to do away with the fourth beast once and for all.\n\nFor now, we live in the tension of prophecy yet to be fulfilled but eagerly anticipated.\n\nWhat we see in this vision is not meant to scare us; it is meant to give us hope for victory. It promises that despite the chaos, violence, pain, and suffering, the Kingdom of our Christ is coming. And when it does, He will reign.\n\nForever and ever, He will reign.\n\n“His dominion is an everlasting dominion  that will not pass away, and His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed” (Daniel 7:14).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Good News in Unlikely Places",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nBecause the Bible is true, even the parts that are confusing or hard to understand are good news.\n\nYou’ve probably heard us say this before at She Reads Truth, but do you think we can find it to be true in today’s difficult-to-understand passage? Is there good news in Daniel chapter 8?\n\nAgain today, we’re talking visions. And again today, we’re pulling our reading from the “apocalyptic literature” shelf (a real crowd-pleaser!). This time, the vision is focused on a ram, a goat, and more horns than a marching band. (I couldn’t help myself, you guys.)\n\nOne fascinating little side note: in Biblical literature, a horn almost always has to do with power, dominion, and authority. Consider:\n\nthe horns blown to take down Jericho’s walls (Joshua 6:5).\n\nthe ram’s horns caught in the thicket to be Abraham’s sacrifice instead of Isaac  (Genesis 22:13).\n\nDavid calls the Lord the horn of his salvation (Psalm 18:3).\n\nThe horns in Daniel’s vision are no exception, but they’re still a little tricky to make sense of.\n\nFortunately for us, Gabriel appears to Daniel in verse 15 to explain what he saw. Here is the gist of the angel’s explanation:\n\nThe two-horned ram represents the kings of Media and Persia (v. 3-4, 20).\n\nThe shaggy goat represents the king of Greece (v. 5-7, 21).\n\nSpecifically, the large horn between his eyes is understood to be Alexander the Great (v. 8, 21).\n\nHistorically, after Alexander the Great’s death in 323 B.C., four smaller rulers (horns) rose in his place, but none were as powerful as him (v. 8, 22).\n\nGabriel goes on to talk about the little horn, “an insolent king, skilled in intrigue,” who causes “deceit to prosper.” This horn is widely believed to be Antiochus Epiphanes (who reigned much later, from 175–164 BC). A wicked ruler and persecutor of the Jews, he is historically renowned for desecrating the temple by sacrificing pigs on the altar and setting it up as a shrine to Zeus. He was a bad guy after a long string of bad guys, in what amounted to a prophetic foretelling to Daniel of centuries of persecution ahead for the Jews.\n\nTo be honest? This is a whole lot of crazy awful. And, I imagine, it was the last thing Daniel hoped to learn in a vision. He’d been praying for deliverance, something this dream promised he’d never see in his lifetime. You know those “good tidings of great joy” the same Gabriel would later deliver to Mary? This was not that. Not even close.\n\nTerrible leaders and violent conquerors lay ahead, and things are going to get a whole lot worse for God’s people before they get better. No wonder verse 27 tells us Daniel “was overcome and lay sick for days.”\n\nMaybe you feel like Daniel today. Maybe you’re also learning firsthand that God’s deliverance is rarely quick or tidy. Perhaps you’re beginning to understand, like the Israelites learned, that God doesn’t always take us out of pain or heartache. Instead, He gives us the grace and everything we need to persevere in heartache (2 Peter 1:3).\n\nIn one sense, our world is not what it used to be; in another, it’s exactly as bad as it’s always been. Headlines leave us confused and distraught like Daniel, knowing things may very well get worse before they get better. \n\nOur omnipotent God is able to turn nations on a dime, just as He mercifully and quickly delivered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednago from the flames. But even if He does not, He is able to preserve His people in the midst of their persecution.\n\nI suppose Daniel 8 is good news then, isn’t it? Because the Bible is true, we can look all manner of persecution in the face and have confidence that nothing in the present or future can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:38-39).\n\nAnd so, as believers who suffer or endure persecution, we can rise up and go about the King’s business just as Daniel did. Even when we don’t understand. Even when we are overwhelmed. Because the greatest evils in the world will come face to face with the Prince of princes and “will be shattered—not by human hands” (Daniel 8:25).\n\nThanks be to God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nWhen I was fourteen, I fancied myself an actress. To prepare for my future in the theatre I attended every play I could. But I grew up in rural Michigan, so the plays I could attend were mostly just other school productions.\n\nOne especially unfortunate night I sat through a ragged performance of “The Pajama Game.” After two acts of awkward silences, off-key solos, and one actor with a very inappropriate interpretation of Factory Worker #2, the lights came up and I breathed a huge sigh of relief. I could cross this musical off my list and go home!\n\nBut no one else left. There was more musical to go. So very much more. I had to sit in that hot gymnasium on hard bleachers and subject myself to another painful hour of bleating song and dance.\n\nHave you ever thought something terrible was almost over, but it was only just beginning? It’s such a sinking feeling.\n\nThis is just what happened to Israel. Daniel and the Israelites were in exile in Babylon, but as Daniel read through the history of Jeremiah he found this great part: “When 70 years for Babylon are complete, I will attend to you and will confirm My promise concerning you to restore you to this place” (Jeremiah 29:10). Daniel did some quick math: YES! The seventy years are almost over! Our exile is coming to an end! We get to go home! Huzzah!\n\nBut then Daniel did a little looking around and thinking. What was the purpose of this exile? Why did God let Babylon capture us?\n\nIt’s the same old reason, isn’t it? The same thing that got them into trouble last time, the same thing that gets us into trouble— grimy, sinful hearts.\n\nThe purpose of the exile was for God’s people to get their act together—to repent, pray, and confess— only, they weren’t doing that. On the whole, Israel was still in the same rut that got them sent into exile in the beginning. But the seventy years were almost over! What if they hadn’t learned their lesson yet?\n\nThey had not. The lesson of repentance is one we are still learning to this day. But Daniel was convicted by God’s Word, so he prayed, confessed, and interceded for God’s people. That is exactly what should happen when we read God’s Word! The Bible redirects us to truth and drives us to prayer.\n\nLet this be our response every time we read God’s word: pray.\n\nGod heard Daniel’s prayer and He answered with a promise: I will restore Israel in my perfect time. Seven is the number of fulfillment and completion. God was preparing the way for both the judgment of the wicked and also the coming salvation—Jesus!\n\nOur God is always at work in all of time, space, and history. When it seems to us that the timing is wrong, or something is taking too long—like that horrible musical, or an exile in Babylon, or a hard relationship, or a lingering sickness—remember: God is always at work and His timing is right.\n\nOur impatience with God’s timing throughout history is well-documented and epic. And God’s timing is still perfect. He doesn’t need us to approve, but in the midst of our waiting, He invites us to pray, confess, and repent.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The True Battle",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nChapter ten opens in a vulnerable spot for our beloved Daniel. It’s about 536 BC, just a few years after Cyrus, the king of Persia, issued a decree allowing the exiles from Judah to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple (Ezra 1:2-4).\n\nDaniel is in his mid-eighties, physically unable to make the long journey to the land that was once Judah. In great distress, he mourns the difficulty facing those who have returned to Jerusalem. He fasts and prays for three weeks, seeking wisdom about the future of his people, God’s holy nation.\n\nThree weeks seems like a long time to pray for a little wisdom. Why couldn’t God have answered him right away?\n\nThe angel tells Daniel his prayers were heard—on the first day. He’d been sent to Daniel right away, but the prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed him for 21 days (Daniel 10:12-13). The angel was detained for the exact amount of time Daniel was waiting for an answer.\n\nDuring those three weeks of fasting, Daniel probably felt as if his prayers weren’t heard. But they were! God had immediately sent His messenger with a vision for Daniel—an exact answer to his prayer!\n\nSpiritual warfare is real. Daniel’s answer was delayed because the prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed the messenger. This wasn’t a human prince, but a demonic spirit (possibly Satan himself), influencing the Persian Empire and opposing God’s purposes.\n\nThe angel was detained by evil spiritual forces while our man Daniel was on his knees praying earnestly for wisdom. Yes, Satan attempted to oppose God’s plan, and God allowed that. God fulfilled greater spiritual purposes that we will likely never know, but He also allowed this delay to sanctify Daniel.\n\nWhat happens after fasting and praying for three weeks? Kneeling before the throne of heaven, seeking His face without ceasing? You’re changed. God had allowed this spiritual battle to commence as He worked to sanctify Daniel, drawing him close.\n\nThe angel reveals to Daniel God’s plan for His chosen people—a prophecy of the future so detailed it could only come from the One who holds it in His hands. The answer to Daniel’s prayer for wisdom was eternally significant. When evil forces work hard to thwart God’s purposes, we can be sure something significant is at stake.\n\nTwo years ago, I sat hunched over the edge of my desk chair, sobbing in my office. God had opened the door for me to start pursuing a seminary degree—a desire He’d grown in my heart for many years. Now, it was time. But I was suddenly crippled with fear.\n\nHow could I keep up with classes, a full-time job, ministry obligations, let alone any sense of community? Three weeks into my seminary education, I was about to quit.\n\nGod had called me to something big, but suddenly it didn’t feel practical anymore.  By His grace alone I didn’t quit—I wanted to, but didn’t. And the exact same thing happened the following three semesters. A few times it was financial, a few times practical, but four semesters in a row, I almost quit. \n\nIt took me four semesters to realize one thing: we have an enemy who wants to destroy what God is doing (John 10:10). All of it. Every good thing, every calling God has placed on our lives, the enemy wants to destroy it. \n\nLet us not forget that our struggle is not against flesh and blood on this earth. It is against the powers that work hard to thwart God’s purposes (Ephesians 6:12). God wants us prepared for battle, standing firm. He has given us weapons to demolish strongholds—His Word and prayer—and we need to be ready for the days of evil, which, according to Daniel 11, are still to come. \n\nLook once more at the promise at the end of the vision. After all the wars and turmoil, all the fighting and oppression and annihilation, look at this promise: “Those who are wise will shine like the bright expanse of the heavens” (Daniel 12:3).\n\nFor God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. (2 Corinthians 4:6)\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nI’m a hopeless lyric geek. Nearly everything reminds me of a song.\n\n“Go on your way, Daniel,” the angel says (in verse 9 and again in verse 13). And I immediately start singing Fleetwood Mac. You can go your own way (Go your own wa-aaa-ay). And because I’m always up for a distraction, Frank Sinatra and a whole host of random musical characters continue the game in my head.\n\nI’ll do it my way. Are you gonna go my way? Love will find a way. She’s got a way about her. Oooo, baby I love your way.\n\nI attribute my lyrical obsession to my endless hours spent singing along to cassette tapes in the car with my brother and friends growing up. We lived in a small Alabama town where “riding around” was the coolest thing a teenager could do, and the pastime was exactly as glamorous as it sounds. But make no mistake—we cruised that single stretch of highway like our life depended on it. I think sometimes we actually thought it did.\n\nI was a good girl (loved my mama, loved Jesus, and America too. Tom Petty, anyone?). I did well in school and followed more rules than I broke, especially in the light of day. But underneath, I was trying to find my way just like we all were. It was acceptance and significance we were after. Our goal was our glory, be it in the form of a beer and a cigarette or youth group council and extracurricular accolades.\n\nMany days I find myself back there, desperately trying to build my own kingdom.\n\nStaring at the aftermath of these 12 chapters of Daniel—all the egos and kingdoms that have crumbled in both dreams and real life—I see it as clearly as when I look back on my high school self. So much effort for things that matter so little, so many idols built up just to watch them fall. Perspective might come easily enough with 20 years or 12 chapters, but not so much when you’re in the thick of the struggle and the waiting.\n\nIt’s no surprise that Daniel (by this time an old man who’s spent years in exile) stands here at the close of the book feeling pretty awful. He is utterly confused by all he has witnessed and heard, and he has one question: How and when is this finally going to end? Daniel—the man we have praised for his faithfulness, and rightly so—is just ready for this insanity to be over already.\n\nThe angel does not answer Daniel’s question but points him to the answer, in two parts: “for the words are secret and sealed until the time of the end” (Daniel 12:9). The word “sealed” here (also in Daniel 8:26) means to close up for safekeeping, to preserve as-is. The truths Daniel heard and witnessed are everlasting, unchanging truths.\n\nThe earth and all its works will burn up, but the Word of God will last forever (see 2 Peter 3:10 & Isaiah 40:8).\n\nThe angel also says this: “None of the wicked will understand, but the wise will understand” (Daniel 12:10). Wisdom is not knowing the answer, it is knowing the God who IS the answer. Daniel’s question of the “how long?” is a valid one (one echoed throughout Scripture—see Psalm 13). It’s a hard thing to be held captive in a place that’s not your home. We fret and wring our hands, with so many questions about what tomorrow holds, what next year will bring and 30 years after that. Daniel wondered, too. But our God is infinitely bigger than our confusion.\n\nOur view is limited to hindsight, but our God sees from beginning to end because He is the beginning and the end (Revelation 1:8). The only true kingdom is His Kingdom. The only true way is His Way.\n\nFriend, the way for the wisdom and the waiting lies in God’s Word. His Word is where He meets us, day after day, in our place of earthly exile, and fills our hearts and minds with His truth. It is where we find Jesus, who is the Way, the Truth, the Life (John 14:6). True wisdom starts here, prayerfully reading the pages of His Word.\n\nSo get up and go on your way today, sister. Be free of building your own kingdom. Take heart knowing that your way is not your own. The God of Daniel leads you.\n\n \n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hosea 1:1-11, Titus 3:4-7\n\nI spent many years being a wanderer. In many ways, I still am.\n\nMy heart is easily distracted by false loves, things I imagine will bring me life when all they really do is pry my eyes from the truer life I’ve already been given.\n\nWhen David and I got married, a family friend—a man his father’s age who’d known David since he was a boy—pulled him aside a day before the ceremony. The words he spoke were not merely advice; they were a mandate, an imperative. Be faithful to your wife, he said. You aren’t immune to infidelity; don’t give yourself the opportunity.\n\nNot a year goes by where we do not remember his advice, admitting our brokenness to one another and praying God’s grace on the promise we made all those years ago.  \n\nAt heart, I am Gomer. I am a woman who sabotages love in spite of what I know to be true. I did it when I was younger, “looking for love in all the wrong places,” as the old country song puts it. And I do it now, looking for love in the praise of others, in social media likes, and even in the refrigerator late at night. I hear the call of my false loves every day. And every day, I hear the faithful call of my One True Love, the God who made me for love in the first place.\n\nHere is what the Lord said to the prophet Hosea when Israel was going her adulterous way:\n\nGo and marry a promiscuous wife\nand have children of promiscuity,\nfor the land is committing blatant acts of promiscuity\nby abandoning the Lord.\n– Hosea 1:2\n\nThe word “promiscuous” here is a heavy word. Other versions translate it as “wife of whoredom,” “wife of harlotry,” or even “prostitute.” The woman God was calling Hosea to pursue was not just double-minded; she was actively and consistently deceitful, disloyal, and devious. She was all of us.\n\nIsrael was caught in a cycle of sin, and God was ready to get her attention. Hosea was to show Israel her sin, literally, by taking an unfaithful wife and being faithful to her.\n\nGod’s judgment on His unfaithful people was more than clear. They were not fit to be His people. They were not fit to be His, period. And yet…\n\nYet the number of the Israelites\nwill be like the sand of the sea…\nAnd in the place where they were told:\nYou are not My people,\nthey will be called: Sons of the living God.\n– Hosea 1:9-10\n\nThe Lord, the perfect and faithful One, would have mercy, grace, and compassion on Israel, the always-unfaithful ones. God said of Israel, “I will deliver them by the Lord their God. I will not deliver them by bow, sword, or war, or by horses and cavalry” (Hosea 1:7). This would be no worldly rescue. This would be the promised salvation of God’s people by the Almighty God Himself, a promise established from the first sin of the first man and woman in the first book of the Bible (Genesis 3:15).\n\nThe consequences of sin were real and painful, but the rescue would come—not by the merit of those being rescued, but because of the merciful grace of God.\n\nAnd that, friends, is the theme of this book we begin reading today. The book of Hosea is a treatise on the unworthiness of sinners and the graciousness of God. We are wanderers, all of us. We run after false loves while the Father runs after us. But, praise the Lord, His faithfulness is greater than our sin.\n\nHe saved us—\nnot by works of righteousness that we had done,\nbut according to His mercy,\nthrough the washing of regeneration\nand renewal by the Holy Spirit.\n– Titus 3:5\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: Hosea 2:1-13, Ezekiel 21:1-7\n\nWhen I was in college, I volunteered as a Young Life leader. That meant I spent my afternoons driving to a local high school, only to awkwardly walk through the cafeteria, trying to befriend high school girls, and eventually, tell them about Jesus. \n\nEvery summer, we took hoards of high schoolers to a camp in Colorado, where we promised they’d have the “best week of their lives.” Midnight obstacle courses, pool parties, and delicious family-style meals were all punctuated by “club,” a gathering where we’d scream songs at the top of our lungs, and then later quiet down and listen to a speaker talk about God and this man called Jesus. About three days in, the speaker stopped talking about God and started talking about sin, something he told hundreds of teenagers they were powerless to fix.\n\nThat day was never fun. And neither is today’s passage from Hosea.  \n\nHad I read these verses a few years ago, I would have written a true but shallow reflection. Something about how angry God gets at our sin, and how grateful we should be for Jesus. Back then, I knew I was an adulterer theoretically. But practically speaking, I’d done a pretty good job of following the rules. \n\nNow, here I am, reading these verses with new eyes, on the other side of a marathon of misplaced affections. Angry at God and threatening to sabotage my relationships and even my marriage, I chased down false loves I knew were off limits to me: a job that took me away from home, clothes and experiences that were out of my budget, a belief that freedom existed outside the walls of my life rather than within them. I ran hard. God wasn’t giving me what I wanted, so I pursued other gods instead.\n\nNow, here I am, reading from God’s Word, “This is what the Lord says: I am against you” (Ezekiel 21:3). Are there any more terrifying words? But when I am pursuing sin, I need the Lord to oppose me. I need the Lord to intervene.\n\nOn a Saturday in April, sitting in a grassy field in the middle of Tennessee, I held a cell phone to my ear and cried my eyes out to a dear friend who had watched me choose that futile path. “I’ve been running for so long,” I cried to her. And her response came slowly, softly. “That’s the thing about God. When you’re running, He’s in hot pursuit. And He will take you down.” \n\nLet me say this from firsthand experience: getting taken down by God doesn’t always feel good. The New Testament tells us that God’s kindness leads us to repentance (Romans 2:4). But that kindness, in the moment, may not always feel so kind. It can be mortifying. Embarrassing. Oftentimes, it is public, because our Lord is the King of bringing things from darkness into the light (Luke 1:79). \n\nHe could turn us back to Him with a soft and tender hand, and often, He does. But sometimes, His kindness comes with thornbushes, with walls in our way (Hosea 2:6). With shipwrecks and blindness and the belly of a whale. He turns us back with Calvary—the bloodiest kindness of all. \n\nThat’s what made those days in Colorado so powerful: watching teenagers learn the joy of a grace that is greater than our sin. God has once and for all redeemed our lives with the cross. We are His. And because He is holy and loving, and because we are His children, He will not tolerate our false gods or sit idly by while we run from Him. \n\nPraise God, He takes us down.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Hosea 2:14-23, 2 Samuel 12:1-10\n\nMan, I love being on the right side of an argument. \n\nBeing “righteously right” is more satisfying to me than a dark chocolate-covered pretzel (and those are pretty darn good). Sure, I’ll forgive you—just as long as you know I’m the one administering the mercy, and you’re the one admitting your shortcoming. It’s restoration on my terms and with my limits. You’re welcome.\n\nNot super attractive. Not to my kids, not to my husband, not to the people I work with, and not to the One seated on the Mercy Seat. \n\nBut mercy isn’t about our righteousness. We don’t grant mercy because we are more and someone else is less. We grant mercy because we have been granted mercy. Period. We watch God, in His Word and in our own lives, act in mercy toward us every day. He requires us to repent but He doesn’t make us grovel. He invites us, just like He invited Israel, to return from how very wrong we are. And He makes us right because He is righteous. Because we have been shown real mercy, we can begin to learn to show the same.\n\nDo you see the way God demonstrates mercy to His people in today’s reading? Israel is wronger than wrong—deeply unfaithful and offensive—and God makes plans to allure His unfaithful bride with tenderness. And my favorite: He promises to make the Valley of Achor (also known as the “Valley of Trouble,” a place synonymous with sin and death) into “a gateway of hope” (Hosea 2:15). Not even a gate—a gateway!\n\nGod makes it easy for us to come home too. He laid out the welcome mat for unfaithful Israel in spite of their wandering and unwillingness to return His faithfulness. God’s unrelenting love was just that—it never stopped inviting. And it never stops inviting and pursuing us. Not only does God’s faithful love save us, it also teaches us. It shows us how to show mercy—how to be unrelenting in our tenderness, offering gateways of hope because the same has been done for us. \n\nAs we read the book of Hosea, we learn no one is beyond the reach of God’s forgiveness. No one is too wrong to receive mercy. God may bring judgment and consequence for our sins, but His ultimate aim is restoration, as demonstrated even in the way He renamed Hosea’s children. \n\nHe calls us His people too. He calls you His person. His Word teaches us—from Eden’s fig leaves, to Hosea’s family, to the very line of David—that God is in the eternal business of turning condemnation into restoration. This restoration is for us to receive, and for us to offer to others. Being righteously right won’t get us anywhere, but joining the Father in His business of restoration is work worth doing well. Receive His invitation today, friend. Receive His mercy. \n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Hosea 3:1-5, Romans 5:6-8, Exodus 20:1-3\n\nIt started the way these things always do. I ate a cookie and wanted another one. \n\nBut here’s the catch: Although it tasted like gooey, chocolatey goodness, it was technically considered a protein bar, something you’d proudly toss in your workout bag. But delicious and permissible? These things do not just happen. I felt like I’d unlocked THE secret to eternal snacking bliss. \n\nGomer’s story starts the same way. She was hungry for love, and she had it in her husband, Hosea. But she wanted more. Her desire was delicious and permissible—until it wasn’t. And Hosea was left with something far from what he’d hoped for, not unlike the cardboard box that had arrived at my door a few weeks later. \n\nThat box was unexpectedly heavy, underscoring the compromises I’d made on flavor and price in exchange for a pantry filled with a lifetime supply of healthy “cookies.” As I opened the box, red and green labels signaled that my online order of “seasonal” and “limited edition” delights actually meant Christmas (it was May) and crusty (with mold, you guys). So here I am, stuck with a pantry full of rotten, non-returnable snacks. Incidentally, can I interest anyone in a “Snickerdoodle”? \n\nAlthough I’m unsure about their stance on snickerdoodles, we know the Israelites loved raisin cakes. They piled them high and gorged themselves full in observance of the law and idol-worship. We see an illustration of their rebellion through Gomer; their pursuits of dried fruits and her chase after pitted romance would not lead to the one True Vine. \n\nAs a result, Hosea and Gomer’s marriage exited the honeymoon phase quickly—but they aren’t the only ones. Before we point fingers or assign blame, we ought to remember this truth: God is in a terrible marriage, too—with us—one He should have divorced from long ago.\n\nHe loved us first.\nWe loved sin more.\nHe made us without shame.\nWe dirtied the white dress.\nHe gave us a covenant.\nWe didn’t show up to the altar.\n\nYou cannot know how many healthy cookie bars are stuffed in each of my kitchen cabinets, a daily reminder of my unexpected, unwanted purchase. I can’t help but wonder: Was Hosea filled with the same regret? Is God? \n\nHosea is fully aware of Gomer’s adultery, yet God tells him to pursue her still.\n\n“Go again; show love to a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, just as the Lord loves the Israelites though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes” (Hosea 3:1).\n\nHosea doesn’t have enough money to buy her back, so he pays for her with 15 shekels and 5 bushels—the price of a slave (Exodus 21:32). \n\nGod is all-knowing of our unfaithfulness, yet He pursues us still. He gives everything He has to buy us back, paying for us with His Son and a cross—the price for the ungodly (Romans 5:6).\n\nWe are His runaway brides, but He will not divorce us. May we return to Him with awe. Amen. \n\n“Then God spoke all these words: I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery. Do not have other gods besides Me.”\n– Exodus 20:1-3\n\n",

    "devo_title": "God’s Case Against Israel",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nText: Hosea 4:1-19, Proverbs 19:2, 2 Corinthians 4:3-6\n\nI was raised in the church, which means I speak “Christian” rather fluently.\n\nTerms like “quiet time” and “sinner’s prayer,” or cautionary calls to “guard your heart” and “pray for a hedge of protection”—I know all the buzz words. When I went to seminary, I learned even bigger words like “sanctification” and “justification.” Between my background and my education, you could say I know a lot about the Bible. \n\nHowever, I need to confess something about all that “knowledge.” Sometimes, I coast on it. Sometimes, I rely on my familiarity with Scripture, instead of actually opening up God’s Word. Sometimes, I assume what Jesus’ response would be, instead of looking it up for myself. Sometimes, I quote verses that fit the situation, instead of exploring Scripture for a fresh perspective. And sometimes, I substitute vague, scattered prayers for intentional time in God’s Word.\n\nI can go weeks without actually reading the Bible, and no one will ever know. I can mask my neglected faith as a flourishing one, simply because I know the right answers. \n\nBut I can’t do it for long because I am a human being, and human beings forget. We forget God’s faithfulness and we forget His truths, which means we must return to His Word daily. Like water, like food, we must consume Scripture day after day, because our broken minds will struggle to recall it. No matter how familiar we are with God’s Word, we will forget it.\n\nThis is exactly what happened to the Israelites in Hosea. Israel was a people whose history was intertwined with God. His Word and His truth were written into their very identity. And yet, God had this against them:\n\n“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge” (Hosea 4:6).\n\nAccording to Old Testament scholar David Allan Hubbard, this “knowledge” refers specifically to the knowledge of God, a knowledge the Israelite priests had failed to pass on. The people of Israel had, collectively, forgotten who they were. They had forgotten whose they were. And throughout chapter 4, we see the terrible consequences of their forgetting. \n\nWhen you know a lot about God, it’s tempting to take that knowledge for granted. It’s easy to treat your soul like a hard drive, as if you can download the data and click “save.” But our hearts and our minds are more like leaky buckets. Given enough time away from the source, all the water eventually drains out. \n\nProverbs 19:2 tells us, “Desire without knowledge is not good, and whoever makes haste with his feet misses his way.” This verse discourages us from rushing to judgment, or letting our emotions carry us away, but it also has something larger in view. This verse is about the entirety of the Christian life. No matter your upbringing, no matter your desire to serve God, your soul requires daily doses of the knowledge of God. Without it, your heart will slowly wander astray. \n\nIn that sense, the story of the Israelites is a cautionary tale. The Israelites weren’t any different from you and me. They simply forgot. The truth of God, which gives freedom and life, was not a part of their daily diet, so their souls began to stray, and their lifestyles followed.\n\nI am always amazed at how easily we forget. No matter what God does, we forget. Without the “daily bread” of His Word, we can’t remember how to live. That is why, I suspect, there is a deeper invitation behind the simple words, “Hear the word of the Lord.” It’s not just a call to listen, but a call to life.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hosea 5:1-15, Isaiah 29:15-16, Revelation 3:19\n\nWe’d picked out the brown velvet curtains at Ikea not long after we got married, and hemmed them with the iron-on adhesive strip that came in the package. They hung in our first home and then in our second, even though they were about a foot too short with the higher ceilings and taller windows. I always meant to get around to changing them, or at least mending the falling-out hem; but come 2009, I decided I didn’t mind.\n\nShe was 2 years old that year, with wild, thin hair that stuck straight up and a smile so bright it could knock you out. Those too-short curtains were the perfect hiding place for her new favorite game: hide and seek.\n\nI have a few precious minutes of video of the usual scene: our little girl hiding conspicuously behind the brown dining room curtains, her pink sneakers poking out at the bottom and her giggle audible from the other side of the room. Her papa would sneak up slowly and the giggles would get louder, and she would squeal with delight as he threw back the curtain. Hiding was fun, but the true joy was being found.\n\nHosea chapter 5 is a painful read. Israel was playing hide and seek with her God, but this was no game. The people’s very lives were at stake, yet they kept turning to dead idols that reaped only destruction and desolation.\n\nGod warned them through the prophet. His tone, gentle and wooing in the first chapters, had become booming, insistent, firm. The call from the Lord was clear: Come back to Me. If you run, disaster awaits. I’m not saying it might destroy you; I’m saying it will.\n\nYet Israel was “determined to follow what is worthless” (v. 11). In verse 4, the prophet proclaimed:\n\n“Their actions do not allow them\nto return to their God,\nfor a spirit of promiscuity is among them,\nand they do not know the Lord.”\n\nThe sin did not disqualify them from returning and repenting; it kept them from returning and repenting. God’s warning to Israel was His mercy to them; so was His discipline. God turned away so that they might turn back to Him (v. 15).\n\nThe priests and the people of Israel hid in their idolatry and their sacrifices, hoping their rituals might hide their hearts. But there is no hiding from God. He sees all; and, even more, He knows all (v. 3). But as we often do, Israel hid anyway, their tell-tale sneakers sticking out from under the curtains of their sin. We hide, believing we know better, believing we and our “little-g” gods can outsmart the one true God.\n\nWe hide, but He seeks us out. He seeks us out so that we will seek Him.\n\nIsrael’s attempts at deceiving God resulted in her injury, just as He said it would. She turned to her little-g gods for healing (v. 13), and God kept pursuing. Like a lion, He prowled in guard of her heart, doing whatever it took to frustrate her desires for lesser loves, to thwart her attempts to run and hide (v. 14).\n\nAre you hiding today? I am. I feel the Holy Spirit calling my heart to return from places where I’ve gone to hide from my sin, to hide from my own brokenness. Hear our God speak words of hard, merciful truth to us, His children:\n\nI know you, He says. You are not hidden from me.\n\nYou turn to false loves, but they cannot cure you. They cannot heal your wounds.\n\nSeek me. Return and repent (vv. 3, 14-15, my paraphrase).\n\nDear friend, there is joy in having the darkest parts of our hearts uncovered by our merciful Father. Surrender to the knowledge that you are known. You’ve been found out, you’ve been found, and you are loved.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessie Minassian\n\nText: Hosea 6:1-7:2, Matthew 12:1-8, Isaiah 26:16-19\n\nAs a church culture kid, brought up on the lap of youth group events, Christian concerts, Bible camp, and the Awana Olympics, I somehow got the impression that overseas mission work was the highest calling a Christian could have. I truly and passionately loved God, so if that’s where the faith-action was, then that’s where I wanted to be. \n\nTo a wide-eyed high-schooler, anxious for adventure and an uncommon life, the abnormality of mission work appealed to me. I was ready to sacrifice BIG for God. But if I’m honest, that was mostly because I thought a missionary life sounded kind of flashy—daring, and even religiously “successful.”\n\nI took a handful of short-term trips (which, in all reality, probably benefitted me more than the people I went to serve), but I never became a career missionary, not in the way I had pictured, anyway. I was willing, but God had a different plan for my life. Today, my “mission field” looks strangely more like my childhood home than the jungles of the Amazon. \n\nMaybe you’ve wrestled through that tension, too. Can we be faithful to God in the ordinary, or do we have to do “big things” for God for our faith to be legitimate? \n\nIn Ephesians 4:1, Paul urges believers to “live worthy of the calling [we] have received.” But what does that actually look like? Hosea 6:6 helps us:\n“For I desire faithful love and not sacrifice,\nthe knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.”\n\nThis verse shows us what God considers the highest devotion to Him, what He wants most: faithful love over sacrifice, a relationship with Him over our offerings.\n\nHave you ever had a nagging suspicion that giant sacrifices come more easily than quiet faithfulness? I have. It was easier to dream of living in a foreign land, leading whole villages to Christ, than it is to actually live a quiet, largely unknown, completely unflashy, but faithful life. To be loyal to God even when His plan for me doesn’t make for a great Christmas card.\n\nGod still expected the Israelites to bring the prescribed offerings and sacrifices to the altar. But those things weren’t what He wanted most of all. \n\nSo why would God prefer loyalty and faithfulness over big sacrifices? The answer is the echo of the love story woven throughout the Bible’s pages: God wants our hearts. He is jealous for our affection. He wants loyalty and faithfulness because that’s what you bring to the table when you are hopelessly in love with someone. He wants us to be head-over-heels for Him, and when we are, sacrifices will come easily. \n\nWhether our faithfulness takes us to the ends of the earth or leaves us right where we are, remember what He’s really after: us.\n\n",

Ephraim is unturned bread baked on a griddle. Foreigners consume his strength, but he does not notice. Even his hair is streaked with gray, but he does not notice. Israel’s arrogance testifies against them, yet they do not return to the Lᴏʀᴅ their God, and for all this, they do not seek him” (Hosea 7:8-10).\n\nHave you noticed something here?\n\nEphraim (the largest of the ten northern tribes, whose name is sometimes used to refer to Israel as a whole) has become an out-of-control, hot mess. Meanwhile, the people of Israel are so crazed with self-indulgence they can hardly tell what day it is. But I can’t help standing back a bit and noticing, in all of Israel’s wayward mindlessness as they run to Egypt and Assyria and every which way, God hasn’t changed.\n\nOh, He’s definitely watching. He sees them spiraling out of control, tossing their reputation out the window. He hears the other nations all whispering to each other about “God’s Chosen People” killing off their leaders, one by one, and getting fresh starts from their God, only to get all muddy again (Hosea 7:16).\n\nIsrael is two-faced and double-tongued.\n\nBut if we turn our attention from the squeaky wheel for a moment—if we tune out all the noise—we’ll notice this: God has not changed.\n\nHe has but one face and one tongue. One unrelenting love for His bride.\n\nWe want this passage to be about the rogue bride, or the prodigal son, and how Israel can’t seem to get it right. But it isn’t. It’s about God.\n\nGod’s character never changes. His one face is righteousness. His one Word is holiness. His one undying call to His people is love.\n\nAs the ever-faithful Groom, God remains. Even as His anger burns over the unfaithfulness of His bride, He forgives her. He provides for her. He gives her a fresh start. And in His severe mercy, He even withholds good things from her so that she might return to Him. While Israel hedges its bets on other gods, the Groom has all His focus on His one, true love.\n\nMaybe you don’t need me to spell it out for you today, but in case you do, hear this: you are His one, true love. Wherever you are, whatever you’ve done, whatever anyone else thinks of you, and however long it’s been since the last time you called Him your Groom—He hasn’t changed, and neither has His love for you. \n\n“But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us!”\n- Romans 5:8\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Laura Pierce\n\nText: Hosea 8:1-14, Mark 2:15-17, 1 John 3:1\n\n“They sow the wind and shall reap the whirlwind.”\n- Hosea 8:7\n\nIt’s kind of an absurd picture to imagine. Pushing hard against a plow through air. Carefully planting seeds of air. Sweat beading down as you pull weeds from the air. No matter how determined and sincere the Israelites might have been in their efforts, they were applied to an absolutely immovable force: the wind, a force of nature. \n\nAll those miracles right in front of their faces, day after day, and still they were crouching out back, hammering little bits of metal together to fashion some other god to worship. It’s as if they were eager to put themselves in harm’s way, intentionally hunting down ways to insult and abandon the One who had loved and cared for and rescued them time after time. Israel was “a wild donkey wandering alone” (Hosea 8:9). They were a ridiculous people, trying to sow the wind.\n\nIn reality, we’re not so different from the Israelites. \n\nFear and pain and loss surround us. They threaten to rip out our hearts and swallow us whole. Daily we’re tempted to rely on our most sincere plans, determined to live out of our own strength. We strive hard to pile up some measure of security in an unstable world. Whether it’s on the job or in our relationships, we labor at the plow, striving to produce something—anything—that will prove our significance.\n\nWe avoid. We manipulate. We shop. We control. We produce. We sow the wind. We hope, but we hope in the wrong things. \n\nBut “this is what the Sovereign LORD, the Holy One of Israel, says: ‘In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength, but you would have none of it’” (Isaiah 30:15). The Israelites were sinners, just like me and you. But, praise the Lord, Jesus came for wind-sowers like us (Mark 2:17).\n\nYes, life is painfully hard and the giants in the land are real. We are not enough for any of it, but He is. He offers us rest from our endless plowing. He offers us Himself. \n\nOur wrestling and questioning may never end. Sin will continually call us back to our self-sufficient wandering. But when we turn to God and repent, we exchange our demands of Him for trust in Him. When we recall His faithfulness, we’ll see we can put down our idol-making hammers and put all our faith in Him. And faith in Him is never in vain. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hosea 9:1-17, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, Psalm 51:1-12\n\nMy favorite room in our house is the dining room. True, it may be because we eat food there (and I do love food), but it’s more than that. It’s because of the way it makes me feel. I can’t put words to it exactly, but I knew it the first time I set foot in that room: it was home.\n\nThe intangible quality of feeling “at home” is as hard to replicate as it is to describe, but it is nonetheless deeply real—so real that we spend our lives trying to find it, create it, hang on to it. That’s why I can’t bear to change the color of our green paint-over-panel dining room walls. I want it to always feel the way it did the day I stood in the doorway and cried because I knew I was home.\n\nHosea chapter 9 is about home, but not the warm, fuzzy feeling I get when I walk into my green dining room at the end of a long day. Israel had forfeited all opportunities for true joy in their lives, in their families, and in their homes. Their blatant and persistent sin meant they were no longer welcome in God’s presence, not until they returned with repentant hearts.\n\nBut Israel was not interested in repentance. Instead, they settled into their sin, becoming at home in their shame. Listen to the sadness in the Lord’s description of their turning away from Him and unto their false loves:\n\nI discovered Israel\nlike grapes in the wilderness.\nI saw your fathers\nlike the first fruit of the fig tree in its first season.\nBut they went to Baal-peor,\nconsecrated themselves to Shame,\nand became detestable,\nlike the thing they loved.\n– Hosea 9:10\n\nGod’s people were called to be holy—set apart for Him alone. But they instead set themselves apart for Shame, the very opposite of their holy, just, and loving Father. What choice did He have but to kick them out of His house?\n\nI will drive them from My house\nbecause of their evil, wicked actions.\nI will no longer love them…\n– Hosea 9:15\n\nAnd that’s where the story would end without the gospel—with me, you, and Israel, sitting on the curb next to a heap of our idols, none of them able to save us or give us a forever home. There we would stay, bound to our shame and humiliation.\n\nShame is not the same as repentance, nor is humiliation the same as humility. It is not enough to be aware of our sin, wallowing in our brokenness. We must (and we may!) repent and return to our holy, gracious God.\n\nPraise the Lord, He loves even the wanderers. He seeks us out and beckons us home by the perfect sacrifice of His Son, Jesus. The Holy One invites us to exchange our worship of impotent idols for worship of Him, the only living God. He washes us of our guilt, breaks our chains of sin and shame, and binds us to Himself. Thanks be to God, we “who were far away have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah” (Ephesians 2:13).\n\nIn Christ, we are at home. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Hosea 10:1-15, Matthew 11:28, Psalm 25:12-22\n\nThere are some passages of Scripture that are really hard to read because they don’t tell us pleasant things. This passage in Hosea is one of them; it talks to us about sin and about its undeniable consequences.\n\nI like it best when I can imagine Jesus patting me on the shoulder, saying, “Well done, good and faithful servant” (Matthew 25:23). But instead of patting me on the back, Hosea 10 kicks me in the pants.\n\nWhy would God say all this to us? Why can’t we skip over the nasty parts and hear about something nice instead?\n\nThe truth is, we cannot fully understand the gospel without this very real and difficult realization of sin. The gospel isn’t a “skip over the difficult stuff” message. It’s the answer to an ugly, deeply rooted problem in our hearts. On their own, our hearts aren’t naturally inclined to seek the Lord and do what’s right.\n\nWe may like to claim a kind of made-up righteousness of our own, but those are “mere words” and “false oaths” (Hosea 10:4). In truth, apart from God’s bountiful grace, we are like Israel. Our actions reveal what we really believe, that “we do not fear the Lᴏʀᴅ” (v. 3). That’s frightening, because Hosea tells us where all this leads: shame, judgment, and war. \n\nBut even in this passage about the darkness of sin, God shines a light for us. When God calls us to “sow righteousness” (v. 12), He’s not simply commanding us—He’s also beckoning to us. God is throwing a rope down into the well to pull us up out of the darkness and muck of our sin. \n\nFrom the deep pit of our own destruction and despair, we hear a steady, loving voice calling even now: \n\n“Sow righteousness for yourselves and reap faithful love; break up your unplowed ground. It is time to seek the Lᴏʀᴅ until he comes and sends righteousness on you like the rain. . .  Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Hosea 10:12; Matthew 11:28).\n\nHosea is a book about God’s wooing of an undeserving people. While the reality of our sin may make us want to run from God, the reminder that He desires good for us, not destruction, draws us close. Difficult passages like this remind us that God longs for our wandering hearts to return to Him and receive His cleansing grace. \n\nLet’s not wallow in our shame, but instead run with abandon back to our loving Father. As we do, He will continue to pursue us as He always has, to rescue us from even the deepest darkness of our hearts.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hosea 11:1-12, John 6:32-40, Matthew 23:37\n\nThe books had gathered dust in the corner of the room for too long, and I was finally putting them in their rightful place on the hallway shelf. I brushed off each one, shaking out the pages as dust particles danced in the sunlight. That’s how I found it—a torn strip of paper sticking out of the top of an old paperback. The words were written in crayon, in my handwriting: Mama, we’re always in the family, right? \n\nAs soon as I saw it I remembered. It was about two years ago, and all three of our children had become adorably addicted to affirmation. When they got into trouble, or sometimes just because, they would ask the question again. I’d written it down so I’d remember.\n\n“Mama, we’re always in the family, right?” Yes, of course, we’d say. You will always, always be part of this family. \n\nThey haven’t asked the question lately, now that I think of it. I hope this means they’re learning what it means to be a beloved child. \n\nWe’ve come a long way in the book of Hosea. We’ve seen Israel struggle to believe that God is who He says He is. We’ve seen them struggle to repent and obey. And while the whole book makes us ache with recognition of our own sin, these verses at the start of chapter 11 have to be among the most heartbreaking. \n\nWhen Israel was a child, I loved him,\nand out of Egypt I called My son.\nThe more they called them,\nthe more they departed from Me.\nThey kept sacrificing to the Baals\nand burning offerings to idols.\nIt was I who taught Ephraim to walk,\ntaking them in My arms,\nbut they never knew that I healed them.\n– Hosea 11:1-3\n\nGod had been with Israel from the beginning—loving them, providing for them, healing them, leading them “with ropes of love” (v. 4). He was faithfully their Father, but they had forgotten what it meant to be His beloved children. \n\nIt’s not hard to imagine ourselves in Israel’s shoes. Those shoes are where we live. We forget. We are unfaithful. We ignore the hand who heals us. But our sin is not the headline here. The headline is God’s faithfulness. \n\n“How can I give you up?” He asked His children, while they continued to wander in their idolatry (Hosea 11:8). Jesus echoed God the Father’s heart in the Gospel of John: “Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never cast out… This is the will of Him who sent Me: that I should lose none of those He has given Me” (John 6:37, 39). \n\nGod’s people scatter in their sin, yet Christ will lose none—not a single one. I am not the exception to that rule. Neither are you. \n\nIt’s true that we are Israel-caliber sinners. We get lost, wandering through the wilderness of our idolatry. But even when we’re lost, He never loses us. The Lion of Judah will roar as necessary, and His children will return to Him, trembling (Hosea 11:10). Trembling, but at home. \n\nChild of the Father, receive this affirmation today from God’s Word. The One who was with you in the beginning, who has raised you up as His beloved child, will not forsake you now. The sacrifice of His Son has covered your sin, secured your standing, and sealed your hope (Col. 1:14, Rom. 5:17, 1 Pet. 1:3-4). \n\nWith Jesus as your Redeemer, you are always in the family.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nText: Hosea 12:1-14, Psalm 135:13, Isaiah 63:11-14\n\nI am a recent and reticent convert to hiking. Moving from the flat Midwest to a state of unending mountains, there is a certain peer pressure to become a more outdoorsy girl—the type who likes to hike. The problem is that hiking sounds wonderful to me in theory, but the reality of slowly trudging up and up and up is not always as fun.\n\nSo a couple hours into a spontaneous hike with my husband, I was ready to be done. Tired, hungry, and lost, it felt like we were getting nowhere and only increasing our chances of being eaten by a bear. Growing “hangrier” by the minute, I convinced my husband—at this point, probably more afraid of being eaten by me rather than a bear—to head back. \n\nAbout 50 feet back down the worn path, a woman came walking in the direction we had just abandoned.\n\nThis woman had hiked these woods before and she knew the mountaintop was just out of sight, beyond the ridge. She assured us the view from there was absolutely breathtaking and worth every inch of hiking heartache. How could we give up now knowing we were so close? \n\nFeeling a bit foolish, we did a 180-degree about-face, and with renewed hope in our step, we ascended to a clearing. Sitting in silence, staring out at mountains for miles, I realized what we would’ve missed if that woman had not encouraged us to keep going.\n\nIn our walk with God, it can be just as easy to get distracted, tired, and lost along the way. \n\nDo you ever feel like you’ve drifted too far from God to ever come back? Maybe you’re lost in the forest and don’t know just how close the mountaintop really is.\n\nThe book of Hosea reminds us that even when we are unfaithful, God is faithful. Even when we’ve given up, God pursues us. Our God called Hosea to take up a prostitute as his wife and be relentlessly compassionate to her. This demonstrated God’s character and just how much He loved wayward Israel—how He loves us, too, rebellious sinners though we are.\n\nGod declares loud and clear that there is nothing you can do to lose the Father’s love (Romans 8:31-39). \n\nIt can be difficult for us to really grasp the unfailing love of God because it seems so counterintuitive to the way we operate out of our humanity. When we’re hurt, our instinct is often to hurt someone in return or withdraw our love altogether. When people disappoint us time and again, we start to give up on them. To think we can hurt and disappoint God endlessly, yet He still draws near to us, is unfathomable! \n\nOur Lord isn’t some begrudging judge, waiting for us to shape up on our own. He comes to rescue us, helping us turn back to Him (Hosea 12:6). He is the loving Father, running unashamedly toward His prodigal child (Luke 15:20). He is the Good Shepherd who goes off in search of just one lost sheep (Luke 15:4).\n\nSometimes the climb is tedious and disheartening and downright painful. In those moments it’s tempting to give up and turn away. But what we might not be able to see through the trees is the most magnificent view up ahead: our gracious Father, extending His arms and calling us home.  \n\n",

They should know better.\n\nThese people we’re reading about—the ones who “continue to sin” and kiss golden calves (Hosea 13:2)—are God’s people. The Chosen Ones. The ones He brought out of slavery in Egypt and provided for in crazy, miraculous ways. The ones He has been calling to Himself for whole chapters and books of the Bible, year after year, generation after generation. \n\nStill, thirteen chapters into the book of Hosea, no clanging cymbal or shockingly graphic simile is enough to shake Israel out of their sin and cause them to turn and repent. \n\nGod gave Israel food and water in the wilderness, but just as soon as they were satisfied, they forgot why they needed Him in the first place (Hosea 13:6). God is angry with Israel. Shoot, by this point, I’m angry with Israel.\n\nBut Ephraim isn’t the only chaff swirling around on the threshing floor (v. 3).\n\nThat’s me, too, Lord. Isn’t it?\n\nAnd so, our frustration with the Chosen People for being so maddeningly unfaithful to their Helper, turns inward. Their “He’ll be here when we need Him” attitude—putting God in a box on a shelf in case of emergency—sounds disquietingly familiar. \n\nEven waist deep into the book of Hosea, we may find we’re still not giving God the place He deserves in our lives—not up high on some shelf in a box, but on our door frames and at our tables and on our tongues (Deuteronomy 6:6-9). We belong in relationship with Him.\n\nWe may also realize that, like Ephraim, we sometimes talk about God’s grace like it’s a get-out-of-jail-free card (Romans 6:15). We can think of His anger as some kind of scare tactic, where we keep our heads down and toe the line. That might have worked for another generation, but it doesn’t really intimidate us anymore.\n\nBut God still knows us, even as we wander in the wilderness of our sin. He wants our hearts back. So He reminds us, “you know no God but Me, and no Savior exists besides Me” (Hosea 13:4). Amen?\n\nWe are broken, but He is faithful. We are rebellious, but He pursues. We stray. We become prideful and forget who He is. But our change doesn’t change Him. He still wants us back. And He comes for us. Oh, that we would always be amazed by His all-sufficient grace. \n\nWe are more unfaithful than we ever dared believe, but the God of Israel—and of our hearts—is far more faithful than we ever dared hope. Let’s go before our holy God today to thank Him for not giving up on us, even in our darkest moments.\n\n\n\n",

I’m a slave to affection, to being loved, to gaining approval. I am an apostate, abandoning my faith and refusing to believe the gospel’s fullness for my life and heart. I buy my way into the affections of others by being winsome, being faithful, being silent, being whatever they need in that moment. \n\nI make a mockery of it—of the extravagant act of mercy the Son of God made on my behalf—every time I go on sinning so that grace may abound (Romans 6:1). I play hard to get, while at the same time longing to be caught in His infinite love and grace. I know the Truth in my head and struggle to wrestle it into my heart. \n\nLike Gomer, what I fail to see is I am already caught. I’m already the bride of the King of the universe, and I bear His name (Isaiah 54:5). I twist myself to repent of my apostasy, yet God says He alone will heal it (Hosea 14:4). He doesn’t just undo my sin; He heals it because I cannot.\n\nHe loves us freely, without cost, without money:\n\n“Come, everyone who thirsts,\ncome to the waters;\nand he who has no money,\ncome, buy and eat!\nCome, buy wine and milk\nwithout money and without price.\nWhy do you spend your money for that which is not bread,\nand your labor for that which does not satisfy?\nListen diligently to me, and eat what is good,\nand delight yourselves in rich food.”\n– Isaiah 55:1-2\n\nGod’s love is wholly distinct and different from ours. God is love, while Hosea can only give love. Love is who God is (1 John 4:8). He cannot help but love fully, without cost to those He loves, save one: His Son.\n\nThere is nothing that can be done to earn God’s love; this is the primary message of the book of Hosea. In the face of adultery, abandonment, idolatry, deceitfulness—His love remains, without cost, without money. He remains and He loves us freely. \n\nAs you finish reading the book of Hosea, the illustration of God’s extravagant love and our constant rebellion, lift up your eyes from your sin. See your God, your Maker, your Groom in the fullness of who He is and what He has done. Stop twisting yourself to win His affection, and stop trying to heal your own rebellious heart. He has already chosen you—yes, you—to be His bride. \n\nBe His bride. Be healed. Be loved, Beloved. \n\n“I trust in God’s faithful love forever and ever. I will praise You forever for what You have done. In the presence of Your faithful people, I will put my hope in Your name, for it is good.”\n- Psalm 52:8-9\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Joel 1:1-14, Isaiah 17:10-11, Acts 2:17-21\n\nHave you ever done something that was honestly deplorable, something you felt desperate to take back as soon as it was done? Even the memory of it can grind you down and make your fingers ache with regret. Shakespeare calls this “an expense of spirit in a waste of shame.”\n\nThe Minor Prophets show us the result of expending our energy to pursue sin: a locust-eaten wasteland of emptiness and shame. Joel’s assessment of sin is bleak: “Indeed, human joy has dried up” (Joel 1:12). It’s a prophecy similar to that of the other prophets. In a nutshell, he’s saying: “you have forgotten the God of your salvation”—repent and return (Isaiah 17:10).\n\nBut instead of just handing it to us in a nutshell, God shows us in sobering terms the plagues, wrath, and judgment that come from our sin. It is utterly devastating. When I read these words I know deep in my bones I can’t shoulder the weight of such miserable punishment. I can’t take my sins back. \n\nIgor Stravinksy devastatingly said, “Sins cannot be undone, only forgiven.” He’s right. We can’t unsay and undo the shameful things we’ve done. But the minor prophets give us real hope. The judgment for our sins is massive, but that is precisely the judgment Jesus paid on our behalf.\n\nGod the Father levies judgment against us because of our sin, and then takes that punishment on His own shoulders in the person of Christ. The tsunami of judgment that reared up and threatened to obliterate us splashes harmlessly back into the ocean because of Christ Jesus.\n\nWhen we read prophecy, it’s important to ask ourselves, What did it mean to them then? and What does it mean for us now? Joel was preaching a specific message to Israel in the midst of a locust crisis, and he is also preaching to us in the midst of our own crises, today. But in this case, his message is really the same: repent and return to your first love.\n\nThen and now, God is in a relationship with His people, censuring our sins with judgment, calling us to repentance, and extending His forgiveness. He is actively doing it all, all the time. We can respond by crying out to Him with deep thankfulness. \n\nLord, we cry out to you. Forgive us, and teach us to forgive.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Joel 1:15-20, Joel 2:1-11, Psalm 43:4, Romans 10:13\n\nYou’re probably tired of hearing about the locusts. Welcome to the club.\n\nWell, I’m definitely not interested in talking about “cicadas,” a term which, until today, I thought was Southern slang for the locusts we read about in Joel chapter 1: “What the devouring locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten…” (v. 4). For the record, they’re not the same. But they’re still creepy and crawly, and although I’m probably hurting a scientist’s feelings right now, they’re the same in my book.\n\nNot long ago, the 13-year cicadas took over our city, which is why I can say for certain that the worst part about these little pests is the swarming noise. And while we’ve moved on in today’s Scripture passage without mention of locusts, that doesn’t mean they aren’t there. We’ve just needed to focus on other things Joel tells us will signal the day of the Lord—and it’s quite a list. Compared to food shortages and moaning cattle, the locusts are nothing.\n\nThat’s what I was beginning to think a few week’s into our recent cicada invasion: Maybe things weren’t so bad! In fact, the swarming sounds were sometimes soothing, like white noise, compared to newer frustrations like recent headlines, car repairs, and dental surgeries. Then, just when I was beginning to consider the cicadas old news, someone sent a mass email to our neighborhood with the subject line, “High-Pitched ‘Whirring’ Noise Throughout Neighborhood.” It read:\n\nDoes anyone know where the noise throughout the neighborhood over the past few days has been coming from? It’s loud over here! Hoping it will cease in the near future, but just wondered if anyone else is aware of the source?\n\nI’m not sure how our neighbor had successfully avoided them for weeks. But as I recalled my own miserable first encounter with the swarming bugs, I felt the urge to send her a sympathy casserole. \n\nWith the ever-increasing list of destruction headed our way in Joel, I think we, too, need a reminder of exactly how bad things actually are. Sin is real, and it is devastating. \n\nSomething I’ve learned about the locusts in Joel, versus the cicadas of my own experience: their swarming results from a collective desperation to be fed, and it is extremely damaging to crops in their path. The hungrier they get, the louder they become.\n\nIsn’t it the same for us? We are willing to destroy almost anything in the name of satisfaction. We are are willing to worship almost anything for a promise of fulfillment. Sin rages, and we continue to turn up the volume. \n\nWe cannot be counted on to stop and listen on our own, which is why it’s so beautiful that, above all the terrible noise we’ve grown accustomed to, God still makes Himself heard.\n\n“The Lord makes his voice heard\nin the presence of his army.\nHis camp is very large;\nthose who carry out his command are powerful.\nIndeed, the day of the Lord is terrible and dreadful—\nwho can endure it?”\n– Joel 2:11\n\nHe doesn’t just make His voice loud as the day of judgment approaches. He makes sure it’s heard by those who love Him, and beckons to those who don’t yet know the sound of His voice. Upon hearing Him, may our hearts respond in love and in praise, echoing the sentiment of the psalmist:\n\nThen I will come to the altar of God,\nto God, my greatest joy.\nI will praise you with the lyre,\nGod, my God.\n– Psalm 43:4\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nScripture Reading: Joel 2:12-17, Zephaniah 1:7, Romans 5:18-21\n\n“Repent and believe.” \n\nThese are the words Christ uses in the Gospel of Mark to begin His earthly ministry (Mark 1:15). But isn’t it funny how quickly we skate past that first part? Believing is beautiful, but repentance is less glamorous. Yet, right out of the gate, Jesus’ ministry began with a call for us to repent of our sin and believe He came to save us.\n\nIf we skip repentance, what do we believe He saves us from?\n\nI spent thirty years hearing the story of the prodigal son one way: a young foolish son squandering his inheritance, only to crawl back home when he had nowhere else to turn. To me, the story was always more about the father. I assumed the lesson here was that I should be as forgiving of foolish people as he was. Years passed, and now when I read that same story, I realize I’m not the father in this scenario. I’m the young fool. The story is as much about repentance as it is about forgiveness. \n\nScripture tells us the son came to his senses. He found clear eyes to look around and see the mess he’d made, then delivered a simple yet profound confession and repentance to his father: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I’m no longer worthy to be called your son” (Luke 15:21).\n\nRepentance wasn’t easy. The son wasn’t even sure if his father would take him back. But the father received him with open arms as a beloved son.\n\nIf Christ calls us to repent and believe, let’s not skip the first step. In doing so, we miss the fullness of the gospel. Let’s listen closely and hear the call to repentance spoken by the prophet Joel on behalf of God Himself:\n\n“Even now—this is the Lᴏʀᴅ’ꜱ declaration—turn to me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning. Tear your hearts, not just your clothes, and return to the Lᴏʀᴅ your God. For he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in faithful love, and he relents in sending disaster.”\n– Joel 2:12-13\n\nLet’s rend our hearts, like the prophet Joel said. But let’s do so with the confidence that we are returning to a Father who will receive us with open arms and forgive us. He will rejoice over us with singing” (Zephaniah 3:17). As my pastor sometimes says, when our repentance is at its deepest, the joy of our salvation is at its highest.  \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Joel 2:18-32, Zechariah 10:6, 1 Thessalonians 5:2\n\nIt feels like I am always waiting for the Holy Spirit to move, and I have grown weary in my waiting, angry with my unmet expectations of Him. I have distrusted Him and come to believe He has poured out Himself on every son and daughter but me. \n\nFor many years I believed the Spirit was a second blessing, the first being salvation alone through faith alone, and the second coming only through the laying on of hands and impartation of the gift. But when I began to read my Bible I began to see the gift of the Holy Spirit was not a second blessing as much as a coupled blessing: my salvation came with a built-in helper and comforter and teacher, just as Jesus promised it would (John 14:15-31). \n\nMy stumbling block then, it seemed, was struggling to believe this and live as though it were true—to live as though the Spirit Jesus said He would send had indeed come and lived within me, empowering me to bear His fruit, speak His truth, live in His fullness. Because I did not believe the Spirit came with my salvation, I had spun my wheels for years waiting for something. But what? More? Some evidence that I was a true believer? \n\nI believed I was not enough of anything for the Lord of the universe to condescend to me and give me gifts. I had read Joel 2:29 and the quoting of it in Acts, but had never noticed the words, “Even on my male and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit” (Acts 2:18).\n\nEven on.  \n\nThose two small words began to shift something in my belief about my salvation and story. God, the Creator of all, who came in the form of Jesus to earth, and left His Spirit to lead His children into all truth, had not omitted the male and female servants from the gift. He had not passed over the lowliest and poorest. He did not have levels of Christians or levels of the Spirit to give to those Christians, because the ground before the cross of Christ was level. \n\nJesus is not merely a respecter of persons but a hunter of faith. Faith is the only prerequisite for the gift of the Spirit. Faith alone, and nothing else. \n\nI know there are many views on the role of the Holy Spirit, and maybe you’ve felt confused by what you’ve heard. Today, if you’re wringing your hands and waiting, hoping and praying He won’t pass you over, I want to assure you that, if you are His child, He has not passed you over. He has given His Spirit to even the male and female servants, everyone who belongs to the household of God—no matter how long or short your walk of faith has been. \n\nIf you have trusted in the work of Christ to save you, the Holy Spirit is the seal of God upon you, helping and comforting you, strengthening and encouraging you, and empowering you for the work of God. He is the seal that was promised to the all the children of God, and if you are God’s, you have been given the seal, the guarantee, of redemption. Therefore, we need not fear, but rejoice and be glad. For the Lord has done astonishing things (Joel 2:21); He has come to rescue the souls of even you, and even me.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Israel Blessed",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Joel 3:1-21, Isaiah 33:20-22, Jeremiah 33:1-11\n\nWhenever we witness injustice, or experience injustice ourselves, it feels as if vindication cannot come quickly enough. Whether it’s a friend who suffers character assassination, a neighbor who is victimized by crime, or children who are targeted by war—all of these injustices create a deep sense of urgency. We pine for justice, for God to make things right again, and in the meantime, every passing moment can feel like an eternal delay. \n\nThis is one of the most gut-wrenching challenges of being a human in a broken world. Jesus will come back one day, but that day is not here yet. And until then, we must wait for justice with all the agony of a woman in labor. \n\nThis agony is one the Israelites knew well. Joel 3 catalogs a long list of unspeakable suffering: young boys traded for prostitutes; young girls sold for wine; a people scattered from home and subjected to the torment of their enemies. Without a doubt, Israel longed for the day of restoration, the day when God would intervene on behalf of His people and bring an end to their misery. Surely there were days when they wondered if God’s justice would ever come.\n\nBut Joel 3 is the Lord’s response to Israel’s questions and longing: justice is indeed coming. One day, it will come like a roaring lion. All will be made well again. God’s people will be restored. Vengeance will be swift. “Shall I leave [my people’s] innocent blood unavenged? No, I will not,” He proclaims ( Joel 3:21). Because the Lord is, and always will be, a refuge for His people.\n\nThis is the promise of Joel, but it is also the promise of eternity. In Joel we see the character of God and the arc of human history, which guarantees two things:\n\nFirst, God’s justice is coming. Throughout Scripture, God promises that justice is coming. Sometimes the wait is long, but the promise is sure because we can trust the Promiser. As Christians, we bear witness to God’s in-breaking justice when we advocate for justice in the world, but on those days when evil seems triumphant and justice escapes us, we can have confidence that this is not the end of the story. We do not have to grow cynical or despair, because hope will have the final word.\n\nAnd second, God’s restoration is radical. It would be easy to read Joel as a story of two sides: God’s people versus the world. Throughout this chapter, God condemns “the nations” (meaning everyone who is not Israel), and He promises their demise. Destruction would seem to be their fate.\n\nBut if we zoom out and consider God’s heart for the nations, we realize this is not a story of “us versus them,” or “the good guys versus the bad guys.” In Isaiah 49:6, God tells Israel, “I will make you as a light for the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.” In other words, God intends restoration for Israel, but He intends restoration for their oppressors as well.\n\nThis truth is radical, because it means God’s vision of restoration is much bigger than us and our individual injustices. While God promises vindication for the hurting, He desires restoration for all. \n\nThat is both the promise and the character of God. We can trust His justice and live in the hope of it, but His character also calls us into a vision of restoration much greater than ourselves. God’s plan of restoration—the good news of Jesus Christ—is so radical that it even lays claim to our enemies. Without a doubt, God intends to restore us, but He also intends to restore the world.  \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Amos 1:1-15, Amos 2:1-16, Psalm 33:13-22, Isaiah 42:10-13\n\nI have a kid who causes me to say things I never imagined myself saying. I wear myself out shouting unheeded warnings like, “Don’t make new friends in the men’s bathroom! Never ride on a bicycle without a seat! Don’t run your hands on the wooden railings!” Needless to say, when he gets a splinter in his hand, mama is not surprised.\n\nThis leaves me muttering to myself about punitive vs. natural consequences. The punitive variety means I have to impose a punishment, whereas a natural consequence means… if you walk off the edge of a cliff you naturally fall into the gorge below. It feels like a more just outcome when the judgment he needs results in a natural consequence. Then I believe the world is on my side, that he’s getting what he naturally deserves. \n\nIn the first chapter of Amos, the prophet pronounces judgment on somebody else: all the neighbors. Israel knew their neighbors were doing wrong, but did they listen? No, and now they were all going to get their just desserts. Sure, it was a pity, but there you have it: bad people getting in trouble for doing bad things.\n\nMaybe they felt relieved, because this prophecy begins with a judgment of all their neighbors. Finally! They’ll get what they deserve. Our God is going to send fire and break down their gates. I mean, it’s a shame, and we feel bad for them. But better them than us.\n\nBut in the second chapter of Amos, God turns His wrath toward His own people. One by one, He lists the regions of judgment: Judah, Israel, Nazareth. Suddenly, both empathy and Schadenfreude, the feeling of happiness over another’s misfortune, are out the window.\n\nThe judgment is crushing, and of course, much deserved. It is tempting, seeing God’s judgment against sin, to howl in despair. Wait—us, too, Lord? And, if judgment were the end of the story, there wouldn’t be much else to do.\n\nBut the darker it gets, the bigger the cross appears. The words of judgment Amos delivered were designed to drive us to the end of ourselves, to realize that we are just like the nations—just like our neighbors, just like naughty little boys—justly deserving God’s wrath. But this should not drive us to despair, but to Christ.\n\nTake hope, and “look, the Lord keeps his eye on those who fear him—those who depend on his faithful love” (Psalm 33:18). It is His faithful love we must look to, not ourselves. It is neither our own faithfulness, nor our own miserable failures that have the final word. All things are designed to drive us Christ-ward.\n\nMay your faithful love rest on us, Lord,\nfor we put our hope in you.\n– Psalm 33:22\n\n",

The rule’s purpose was to prevent ants, attracted to the sugar, from invading our camp and overrunning our cabins. Therefore, if your mom mailed you a Tupperware container of brownies during the week, you had to abstain from eating them until Saturday, our day off. This posed a challenge to my demanding sweet tooth.\n\nOne afternoon, a package of brownies was delivered to a fellow camp counselor. A few of us gathered around the forbidden Tupperware, looking at it longingly. \n\n“I’m eating one,” I finally said, defiantly. I could not deny my sweet tooth for one more moment and, I reasoned, no one would know. What harm could it do? But just as I was raising the brownie to my mouth, the camp director—our boss—walked by. I paused.\n\n“You gonna eat that?” he asked.\n\nHe won’t do anything to me, I thought. I’m a great counselor. I’m responsible. He likes me. I’m above the rules. \n\nWith this confidence, I took a bite. Right in front of the camp director. Guess who had to spend her Saturday morning power-washing the bathroom floors?\n\nMy attitude in front of my camp director that day is not unlike the attitude of Israel we see described in Amos 3 and 4. Israel was prosperous during this time. They were victorious in their military pursuits and had grown wealthy, acquiring “great houses… inlaid with ivory” (Amos 3:15). But instead of using their wealth and status to do good, they oppressed the poor and crushed the needy (Amos 4:1), directly defying the law that enforced caring for the vulnerable (Deuteronomy 15:7). \n\nIsrael had let their status go to their heads and had begun to consider themselves above the rules. As a result, they slid deeper and deeper into sin. They needed to repent. They needed to change their behavior, and most of all, they needed to remember who God was. \n\nThe biggest pitfall when considering yourself above the rules is that you also begin to consider yourself above the rule-maker. And if you are above the rule-maker, you will naturally tend toward acts of defiance, for there is no longer anyone to defy. This is why I chomped on a forbidden brownie right in front of my camp director that summer. I incurred punishment as a reminder of who was in charge.\n\nIsrael would do the same. \n\nAmos reminds them in these chapters who their rule-maker is. No matter how successful Israel’s military pursuits had been, no matter how prosperous they had become, God still sat on His throne, and “the God of Armies is his name” (Amos 3:13). \n\nI often grow comfortable in my position as God’s child, adopted by the blood of Christ. But this does not set me above the rules; this sets me directly beneath the authority of Jesus, the King of kings. It is now His rule that I follow and not my own. \n\nLet’s praise the God of Armies today. He is the one “who forms the mountains, who creates the wind, and who reveals his thoughts to mankind, who turns dawn to darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth” (Amos 4:13). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Amos 5:1-27, Micah 6:8, Philippians 4:8-9\n\nI am a first-born, Type-double-A achiever, fluent in the languages of performance and gold stars. Grace, on the other hand, consistently boggles my mind.  \n\nI can think back to one such moment several years ago. My husband was on staff at a small church. I did everything I could to partner with him in the ministry that became the functional nucleus of our existence. Ministry is time-consuming and, at times, gut-wrenching. And while my husband seemed to feel a tinge of external pressure, I faced a daily temptation to spontaneously combust. That’s what happens when you try to earn something that has already been freely given; things become volatile in a hurry. \n\nI was serving my guts out for all the wrong reasons, trying to earn God’s favor through church attendance and program planning. I was living for the gold stars that I hoped existed on a cosmic sticker chart in heaven. It’s not that anything I was doing was “wrong” or “bad.” It was just an outflow of a heart tied up in self-inflicted knots. The carrot that was always in front of me was the false gospel of good deeds, not the true gospel of Jesus Christ. That experience taught me that false gospels are terrible taskmasters—cruel, demanding, and ultimately hollow. \n\nGod’s people find themselves whipped by such a taskmaster in Amos 5. Instead of seeking the Lord, their hearts chase wildly after everything else. Amos promises destruction in return for their rebellion. God’s people find themselves fallen, forsaken, and on fire (vv. 2,6). And then comes the wailing, mourning, and lamenting (v. 16).\n\nAs dramatic as this sounds, it feels like the same old same old. God’s people turn to idols and He raises up a prophet to yank them back from the brink of judgment. But this time things are different. There is no golden calf, no Asherah poles, no altar set up to honor a pagan god. Instead, God is enraged by their offerings of “good things,” given for all the wrong reasons (Amos 5:21-23).\n\nGod’s people were following the rules. They gathered like He commanded them to (Exodus 12:16). They faithfully brought their offerings, just like their righteous forefathers had (Genesis 8:20, 22:3; Leviticus 1:3). They even held spirited worship services. What gives? \n\nI think back to that season of ministry and know there are no gold stars in heaven. There is only grace. And grace can never, ever be earned. So Amos might as well have been preaching to us because our hearts are not unlike those of the Israelites: our motives are misshapen, our goal is our own glory, and our worship is all wrong. \n\nYet, even as God breathes out judgment upon His people through Amos, He also offers redemption. He calls out to us even now, saying, “Seek me and live!… Seek the Lord and live” (vv. 4,6).\n\nWorship and sacrifice are meant to be an exclamation of God’s goodness toward us, not a means to try to grab more from Him. If we find our hearts tied up in knots, worrying that we  haven’t earned the gift He freely offers, then we must look for the thread of salvation woven into every tapestry of God’s judgment. \n\nIf you are tired and worn out and empty from striving and performing, look once again to Jesus. It’s His love and devotion—not ours—that turn our hearts back toward Him. \n\nSeek Him and live. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Amos 6:1-14, Amos 7:1-17, Psalm 47:1-9, Acts 4:13-20\n\nIt’s hard to read Amos without squirming. \n\nThroughout this short book—chapter 6, in particular—Amos paints a scene of extravagance and wealth. Israel is at the height of its splendor. Riches, comfort, leisure, and affluence are all theirs for the taking. They are privileged to the extreme, a portrait that sounds quite a bit like many countries and cultures we inhabit today.\n\nMistakenly, the Israelites hoarded their opulence as “blessing.” They saw the provision as an end in itself, a gift from God to be indulged. They also drew security from it. They took pride and comfort in being more powerful than the countries around them. They measured success by having more of it than their neighbors. \n\nGod rebuked them for their greed, and in the strongest possible terms, because He viewed blessing quite differently than the Israelites. God did not intend for the Israelites to prosper simply to luxuriate in it. He did not provide them with wealth simply as an assurance of security. And He did not allow them ease of life simply to grow complacent. The blessings of God were never meant to be stored up like grain. In the wake of God’s judgment on Israel’s pride, Amos cried out, “Lord God, please forgive!” (7:2). \n\nThousands of years later, Amos’s words are as relevant as ever. We continue to live in a world of vast economic disparity. From country to country, and even community to community, the range of prosperity is wide. In some cities, multi-million dollar homes sit within miles of homeless shelters and housing projects, and Christians populate them both. And so, wherever we fall on this spectrum of wealth, Amos challenges us with this question:\n\nWhat are we to do with our blessing? \n\nWhatever the size and the shape of our privilege, how are we to use it? Amos compels us to consider this question, but so does the witness of Christ. Jesus, after all, “did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,” but “took the form of a servant” (Philippians 2:6-7), meaning He leveraged His privilege for others. Jesus denied Himself comfort and set His splendor aside out of love for God and the world. We cannot claim to follow Him without following Him in this also.\n\nJesus’ handling of His own privilege is the standard passed down to us. When we want to know what to do with our blessing, we look to Christ. When we enjoy success, gain, or even a leg up, we are never meant to hoard it for ourselves. Rather, as followers of Jesus, we are meant to leverage our blessing for others, just as He did for us.\n\nThis is radical. Even in the Church, this is radical. When blessing comes our way, it’s easy to receive it as a personal reward for faithfulness. Or it’s tempting to store it away for the sake of financial security. Neither response is wrong in itself, but our vision should always be bigger than ourselves. God’s intention for blessing is never individual; He always has a broader blessing in view. \n\nJust as Israel was meant to be a light to the nations, and the Church a light in the world, everything we are given has a greater purpose. May we steward our blessings accordingly.  \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Amos 8:1-14, Amos 9:1-15, Psalm 53:6, Ezekiel 37:25\n\nI live on the west side of a Civil War town in middle Tennessee. Our kitchen windows face the setting sun, the view framed by tall oaks and the distant red barn that sits on a neighboring horse farm. My mornings begin with coffee at the table, as I watch the settled fog lift to show the glory of the day; evenings end with the sun sliding behind the treeline, welcoming the scattering of stars. \n\nBut many summer afternoons, a strong wind comes and chases away the sun, and from the west we’ll see gathering clouds that can only mean one thing: a pop-up storm. Almost without warning, it will rain so hard we can’t see past our fence. The thunder will rock the ground, and lightning threatens to strike closer and closer with every bolt. \n\nWhen I read Amos 8 and 9, I feel the heavy heartbeat of a summer thunderstorm. I can imagine Amos, seeing the clouds gather, trying to warn the people that the storm of God’s judgment is coming and it will not miss them. \n\nAmos shows us a portrait of an angry God we often shy away from as the God of the Old Testament, as if we are any less culpable than the Israelites who repeatedly turned away from Him. This passage is an important reminder that who God is will never change. His hatred of sin, His anger at those who turn against Him—these are the hard mysteries of His glory, the things we have to wrestle through as we fight our way to the New Testament where we find the unfathomable, gracious, merciful gift of Jesus. \n\nBut we have to weather the storms with our ancestors in faith. We have to feel every thunderclap and lightning bolt to understand the power of our God, which makes His great mercy and faithfulness that much more unimaginable, His promises that much more precious.\n\nBecause after all of His promises of judgment, God makes another kind of promise in chapter 9, verse 11: \n\n“In that day I will raise up the booth of David that is fallen, and repair its breaches, and raise up its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old.”\n\nGod promises Israel that they will never be uprooted from the land He has given them. The storm will end—maybe not for these Israelites in their lifetime, and maybe not for us in ours. The brokenness of the world walks in lockstep with the calendar, each day bringing its own grief and reminders that Christ has not yet come again. But as God promised the Israelites at the end of Amos, restoration is coming. We will not be uprooted. We know the rest of the story. We know our pure, holy, and just God could never be content with the evil and brokenness of sin. But it’s His anger toward sin that led to the greatest mercy of all: the gift of His Son Jesus Christ. \n\nWhen those afternoon storms pass, our backyard is left in the humid haze of the setting sun. The world is clean, the earth watered and refreshed. God has not promised us a life free from storms, but He has promised that one day the storms will end. It’s then that we will dwell with Him in perfect peace forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Obadiah 1:1-21, Genesis 27:41-42, Ezekiel 25:12-14\n\nI am reading Obadiah from the front porch swing just before dark. It’s raining, as it has been all afternoon, though from my last glance at the forecast, I would have sworn today would be sunny and warm. That’s the way forecasts work—for weather and politics, finances and medical prognoses. They are guesses, by definition. But I still check the weather each day when I wake, to see if something bright or somber brews beyond the clouds. \n\nWe’ve heard that knowledge is power, so we look to those with more wisdom and experience than us to divvy out the forecasts. We look to them to tell us what to do, how to think, how to prevent, how to plan. And most of them do their honest best to deliver. Even so, not a single soul can keep the rain from falling. \n\nNo meteorologist can predict the path of every storm. No politician has perfect policy. No surgeon can conquer every cancer. No matter how lofty our intellect and noble our cause, none of us is God. \n\nWe know this in our heads, but sometimes—oftentimes—our hearts forget. \n\nThe Minor Prophets in the Old Testament proclaim God’s judgment on many nations, but the tiny book of Obadiah calls out only one—Edom. Edom is the nation descended from Esau, son of Isaac and twin brother of Jacob. And though Edom’s sins were surely many, Obadiah’s prophecy focuses on one sin that seems to be the root of all their others: pride. \n\nYour arrogant heart has deceived you,\nyou who live in clefts of the rock\nin your home on the heights,\nwho say to yourself,\n“Who can bring me down to the ground?” (vv.3-4).\n\nEdom had grown haughty in their position and power. They felt—and acted—untouchable, invincible. And while they indeed held a privileged position among their neighboring nations, they were not beyond the reach of the sovereign Lord of all nations. \n\nThough you seem to soar like an eagle\nand make your nest among the stars,\neven from there I will bring you down.\nThis is the Lord’s declaration (v.4).\n\nHistory, Scripture included, is filled with rulers and nations like Edom who failed to wield their power wisely. King Saul was lauded as a wise and good king at the start of his reign, but he later turned his back on God, endangering his people and losing his throne (1 Samuel 13). King David was beloved by his people, but his moral failure had disastrous consequences and his own son led a rebellion against him (2 Samuel 11). King Herod was so disillusioned by his power that he ordered a massacre of children in his kingdom (Matthew 2:16). \n\nThese examples may feel extreme or distant to our modern sensibilities, but they point to a truth that still stands: There is only one God worthy of our trust, one King worthy of our worship. \n\nThe Lord promises that Edom—and all nations—will get their due. They’d mocked their neighbors in distress; they’d lorded their position of power over others; they’d failed to offer justice and compassion. Perhaps we have, too. Thanks be to God for Jesus, the one who lived a life of justice, compassion, and righteousness in our place, then took the punishment for our injustice, pride, and sin upon Himself. Only in Him can we find the peace others seek in power, policy, health, and wealth. Only He gives the blessing and home our hearts long for. \n\nHumans will fall and plans will fail, but the kingdom will be the Lord’s. \n\n",

The warm dark cabin around him creaked and groaned as the waves outside surged with increasing intensity. The sailors above deck scanned the horizon and glanced anxiously up at a grey sky heavy with the strength of the Lord Almighty. God was coming for Jonah.\n\nThe prophet was running away, but God pursued him like only the Creator and Lord of the sea could: with a furious ocean tempest. Jonah tried to flee from the very presence of the Lord, thinking he could hide if he found an old boat heading in a new direction.\n\nBut God is fierce and awesome in His pursuit. Jonah never had a chance of hiding. Even the inanimate dice the sailors used to cast lots pointed him out as the one running from God (Jonah 1:7). God had called to Jonah, “Get up! Go” (Jonah 1:2), and now all creation seemed to be shouting, “Return!” God uses wind and waves, even dice—everything in creation stands by to obey its Creator. In the face of the deafening storm and sure signs, the sailors feared for their lives, and looked to Jonah with eyes of blame and hands ready to heave-ho. \n\nGod’s pursuit is relentless exactly because He is so loving. He could’ve crushed Jonah under a tremendous sea surge and found another man. Jonah had his chance, and he clearly took the coward’s way out, right? God gave him a clear instruction (something we all long for), and Jonah ran like a frightened child in the other direction. Why didn’t God give up on Jonah?\n\nGod wanted Jonah. Goodness, isn’t that amazing? I sometimes feel like I’m a substandard version of the person who should actually be living my life. And the truth is, I do fall short. I do worry that there is someone who would be a better mother to my kids, wife to my husband, friend to my friends. But despite my imperfections and failings, I am the best mother for my children, wife for my husband, and friend for my friends. God gives specific callings to specific people (Ephesians 2:10). That means God wants me for my particular calling and life.  \n\nWe can’t escape God and His storm gale of purpose. He pursues us with love that is filled with a beautiful intensity unlike anything else we have ever known.\n\n“Where can I go to escape your Spirit?\nWhere can I flee from your presence?\nIf I go up to heaven, you are there;\nif I make my bed in Sheol, you are there.”\n– Psalm 139:7-8\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Jonah 2:1-10, Psalm 88:4-5, Hebrews 4:16\n\nIf you had to choose a ride at Disney World to be stranded on, which would it be?\n\nOf course, the resounding answer is none, but if you really had to pick, would you choose one that didn’t go upside down? Would you pick your favorite? Maybe you’d go with one that at least overlooks a pretty view. My guess is you wouldn’t pick The Haunted Mansion, filled with ghosts and zombies and who-knows-what around the corner—the name speaks for itself.\n\nYet, speaking from experience, I’d give it five out of five stars. I would definitely recommend getting stuck on The Haunted Mansion. Because, here’s the thing: Florida is eleventy-billion degrees every single day of the year. The Haunted Mansion is dark. The seats recline. It is air conditioned. In fact, I think the best nap of my life happened on those plastic seats when the ride shut down unexpectedly. But if you’d told me this before I buckled my seatbelt, I never would have agreed to get on the ride.\n\nI bet if Jonah had known beforehand that he would get swallowed by a fish, he never would have stepped foot on that boat. Many of the places God brings us to are ones we would never choose for ourselves. But that is the point: When we stop trying to find ourselves, we can see that we’ve already been found.\n\nPastor and author A.W. Tozer said, “In every generation, the people who have found God have been those who have come to the end of themselves. Recognizing their hopelessness, they have been ready to throw themselves on the mercy and grace of a forgiving God.”\n\nThis is why Jonah’s prayer is so surprising to us: it doesn’t sound like Jonah. He hasn’t shown interest in obeying God up until this point, and although he didn’t drown, things aren’t looking especially bright for him. But when stripped of the stories he’s told himself, he sees clearly: Death is not the worst-case scenario; life without God is. \n\nThis is what grace and mercy sound like in the face of death:\n\n“Then you raised my life from the Pit, Lord my God!\nAs my life was fading away,\nI remembered the Lord,\nand my prayer came to you,\nto your holy temple” (Jonah 2:6-7).\n\nOf course, we don’t want to walk through storms and sit in darkness and sleep in the underbelly. But what if we remembered these are the places where grace usually meets us? Sometimes grace is messy and dark. Sometimes mercy is painful and scary. God does not need perfect circumstances to bring us closer to Him. In fact, it’s usually the opposite.\n\nLet’s not overlook that Jonah thanks God for raising his life from the pit while he is still in it. May we do the same today, allowing grace to meet us and mercy to surprise us. We can trust that even as we cry out to God in our distress, He is faithful to answer our call (Jonah 2:2). Thanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Jonah 3:1-10, Jeremiah 18:7-10, Nahum 1:2-11\n\nNineveh was the worst.\n\nA chief city in the already brutal and wicked Assyrian empire, Nineveh removed the noses and ears of their prisoners to mark and maim them for life. And like most Mesopotamian civilizations, their culture was immoral and generally terrifying—temple prostitution, child sacrifice, and infanticide. \n\nI love my ears and nose, so I understand why Jonah didn’t want to go.\n\nThese are the people who heard God’s call to repentance. They listened to Jonah and to God. And they repented. They stopped, tore their clothes, rubbed ashes on their faces, and gave up eating. They were desperate to get God’s attention.\n\nGod had mercy on even these most wicked people. They didn’t know they were that wicked until God arrested them in their sin. But this story is only marginally about the repentant Ninevite hearts. Primarily, this is a story about God’s mercy and forgiveness.\n\nGod calls them to repent, and they respond by fasting.\n\nFasting hurts. It is tangible and practical repentance, and repentance must change how we live our lives. We turn from the things that give us false comfort, and only have God. \n\nFor the Ninevites, fasting meant giving up their means of power and energy, and depending only on God for power in a very real way. They humbled themselves publicly and didn’t hold back for pride or fear of what others would think. Even the king—who held an almost god-like status in the culture and had everything to lose—humbled himself, bowing before the one true God. It was a culture-wide repentance, extending from the greatest to the least.\n\nTheir repentance was not chiefly about how sorry they felt, but about casting themselves wholly upon God’s mercy. It wasn’t about what they could bring to the table. Rather, they said, “Who knows? God may turn and relent” (Jonah 3:9). They recognized that repentance is about what God is doing, not what we can do to gain any kind of merit. \n\nMercy is not a matter of merit; it is God’s gift. When we call out earnestly to Him in repentance (Jonah 3:8), He “is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).\n\nEven though Nineveh was awful by any standard, God had mercy on them. This is good news, because the truth is we are all more like the Ninevites than we are like God. I know I am. I don’t gouge eyes out, yet pride, envy, and wrath are always within arm’s reach for me.  \n\n“But I received mercy for this reason, so that in me, the worst of them, Christ Jesus might demonstrate his extraordinary patience as an example to those who would believe in him for eternal life.”\n– 1 Timothy 1:16\n\nThe story of Nineveh’s repentance is about God’s perfect patience, His deep mercy, and His profound forgiveness. Call out earnestly to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Jonah’s Anger",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Jonah 4:1-11, Acts 11:15-18, Romans 5:6-11\n\nThe final chapter of Jonah gives us a unique glimpse into a conversation between God and His prophet. The majority of prophecy depicts the prophets relaying God’s message. Here, we get to see the struggle between the reluctant prophet and a faithful God. I’m almost uncomfortable with Jonah’s level of irreverence, confessing he is angry that God has been merciful. It’s cringe-worthy.\n\nAnd yet, Jonah was not the first, nor would he be the last, to express discontent with God’s mercy toward a wayward people. In fact, Scripture is full of stories like this. The older brother in the parable of the prodigal son is angry at his father for throwing the rebellious sibling a party (Luke 15:11-32). The Pharisees are angry at Jesus for not following the law like they think he should (John 9:13-16). The disciples are concerned when Jesus addresses a Samaritan woman, someone whose ethnicity and gender signified a person to avoid, not converse with (John 4:1-24). \n\nWe like to belong, and we like to decide who doesn’t belong. They deserve God’s mercy. They don’t. They do. They don’t. Maybe this is why I cringe at Jonah’s anger; because I’ve seen that same anger in me. I’ve seen it on a personal level when blessing and favor are poured out on someone’s life whom I don’t feel “deserves” it. I’ve also seen it on a more global level when I generalize an entire people group as “evil” or “lost,” beyond God’s redemption. \n\nThis sin tendency was in Jonah, and it is in me too. \n\nHow quick I am to forget that I was an outsider once! As Romans says, “For while we were still helpless, at the appointed moment, Christ died for the ungodly” (Romans 5:6). I was ungodly—as evil as a Ninevite. It is only because of God’s mercy through His Son Jesus that I am now in the family as an adopted child of God.\n\nI think it’s interesting that God has the last word in the book of Jonah. We don’t know what Jonah’s response was to God’s question, “Should I not care about the great city of Nineveh…?” (Jonah 4:11). But we know what Jonah’s answer should have been. We see it modeled much later in the story, in the book of Acts. \n\nPeter is trying to convince his fellow Jews that Gentiles can indeed follow the way of Christ. He tells the group that he saw the Holy Spirit descend on a group of Gentiles, just as it had descended upon them. When Peter’s audience heard this, Scripture says, “they became silent. Then they glorified God, saying, ‘So God has granted repentance resulting in life even to the Gentiles!’” (Acts 11:18). \n\nPerhaps they fell silent in awe. Perhaps they fell silent in skepticism. We don’t know. What we do know is ultimately, instead of feeling anger toward God, they glorified Him. They rejoiced that His mercy reached further than they had ever fathomed it could. \n\nOh that our response would be the same. That we would never underestimate the breadth and depth of God’s mercy. That we would rejoice every time His mercy blesses someone around us, remembering that it was this same mercy that welcomed us into His family. And that it is only by grace that we remain.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Micah 1:1-16, Micah 2:1-13, Psalm 46:1-11, Hebrews 6:13-20\n\nOur air conditioner broke this week. I’m from the far north, where central air is a foreign thing and window units are turned on maybe thrice a summer. I live in Texas now, though, and while a heater is a thing you could maybe do without, an air conditioner is not optional. My husband called me today and gave me the estimate of a new system and I felt my stomach drop into my pinky toe. \n\nHow much? I asked him. This much, he said. My mind immediately turned to our savings account. Finally, after a year of beginning to accumulate some savings, we were hoping to have enough to repair our foundation or put some equity into the home itself. WelI, I said, there goes that.\n\nA year ago this month we had a colossal financial loss. It was a perfect storm of sudden job loss, multiple moves cross-country to and from high-priced cities, the sale on our house falling through five times before (finally) selling at nearly a $100k loss to us. We hemorrhaged money for nine months until there was nothing left. I felt as physically defeated as I have ever felt, and our bank account actually was. \n\nIn that space, God did not come through with astounding miracles or great hurrahs. He came in quietly, through a sentence from a friend or a glimmer of hope—for months and months and months. I ached, but I began, eventually, to ache toward healing. He began to hem me in, though in an even a greater way than before, so I could learn to rest in His protection and care for me.\n\nAnd with that healing I imagined God would deeply plant the lessons I’d learned in the process, that I would never have to repeat the same struggle to the same degree. Surely, I knew now that God was my provider, my shepherd, my caregiver? And because I knew it, I assumed He would never take the time to prove it to me again.\n\nI sometimes believe we’re alike, God and I. I reason that because my mind changes, His must too. I’m positive He’s scheming a switcheroo, some grande finale where I’ll be the one left on the outside of the fence. I mistakenly believe I’m saved upon my own merits; the things I have learned or the lessons I have accumulated. I begin to believe I bring myself into the fold and am not simply brought in by Him.\n\nBut God, in His goodness, swore by Himself that He’d bring me in (Hebrews 6:13-20). From the get-go and from the start, before the foundations of the earth, before Eve ate the fruit, before the twelve tribes scattered, before the cross of Calvary, He counted me in. He gathered me in, “like sheep in a fold, like a flock in its pasture” (Micah 2:12)—kept, secure, and protected. \n\nSheep can still get hurt in the fold. They can still sprain a leg or trip over a stump. Today I’m reminded of that as I sit directly in front of my oscillating fan and try hard not to think about our savings account. But sheep in the pasture have a Shepherd who is near to them—caring, attentive, and present. I sometimes begin to believe God has ousted me when things are going badly, that I have sinned too grievously or disappointed Him too greatly. But, the God who does not change, brought me in, and there I remain, His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Micah 3:1-12, Micah 4:1-13, Psalm 25:8-9, 1 Corinthians 10:31\n\nThe book of Micah is a cry for justice, with a pattern of rebuke and restoration throughout its chapters. Micah reads as a defense of justice, and a judgment of those in Israel who do not practice it. \n\nMicah chapter 3 begins with a stunning, almost disgusting, rebuke of the powerful leaders, using cannibalistic metaphor to charge them with oppressing the poor. The prophet spares no words, addressing them as those who “hate good and love evil” and “abhor justice and pervert everything that is right” (vv. 2, 9).\n\nIn his book Generous Justice, Tim Keller writes: \n\n“It is the generosity of God, the freeness of his salvation, that lays the foundation for the society of justice for all. Even in the seemingly boring rules and regulations of tabernacle rituals, we see that God cares about the poor, that his laws make provision for the disadvantaged. God’s concern for justice permeated every part of Israel’s life. It should also permeate our lives.”\n\nMicah’s words—and Keller’s—are disquieting because of how easily I see myself in the oppressors. I have lived a fairly fortunate life, physically and monetarily, and it is so natural to continue to live my fortunate life, day to day, without seeing the ways people are oppressed around me and all around the world. And even when those blinders fall off, it’s easy to merely throw money at a good cause or say an earnest prayer. But both can be done without engaging my heart. \n\nThankfully, we can read on to Micah chapter 4, and see that true justice and knowledge comes from the Lord—not from us. We can go to the mountain of God, where “he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his path” (v. 2). \n\nThis is a beautiful passage, full of some of the most well-known images of peace and prosperity found in the whole Old Testament. From a promise that the people of Israel would be able to turn their swords and spears into plowshares, to the picture of sitting peacefully under vines and fig trees, Micah reveals the end result of loving justice and living God’s way. \n\nMicah’s vision of justice is a vision of the restoration of shalom, God’s original design for the world. In his book Not the Way It’s Supposed to Be, Cornelius Platinga describes shalom as a “universal flourishing, wholeness and delight—a rich state of affairs in which natural needs are satisfied and natural gifts fruitfully employed.” This is the world as it ought to be, as God intended it to be. \n\nMicah shows us two very different visions of the world. Chapter 3 shows us the consequences of not pursuing justice, mercy, and loving our neighbors. And then chapter 4 shows us a restored, peaceful world where we walk with God and in His ways.\n\nMy heart longs for the redeemed world Micah describes, for God’s creation to be restored. This longing makes me want to walk in His ways. It leads me to pray He will rewire my stubborn, entitled, fortunate heart toward justice, to ask that He give me His eyes to see the poor and oppressed. With the Lord leading, the pursuit of justice and shalom becomes a daily endeavor, one we pursue with our Creator God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Micah 5:1-15, Psalm 72:1-11, Luke 1:26-33\n\nThe weight of the gospel sunk deep into my bones when I started looking for Jesus on every page of His Word. Sure, He’s in the Gospels. Paul mentions Jesus often in his letters too. I even knew Jesus got the occasional Old Testament shout out in places like Isaiah chapter 9: “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given…” (v. 6).\n\nBut as God graciously grew my understanding of His Word, He also helped me see that the gospel is the thread stitching the entire Bible together. Jesus weaves in and out of every book. He is the point of every chapter and verse. \n\nSuddenly, I saw Jesus at creation when the Godhead declared, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” (Genesis 1:26, emphasis mine).  \n\nI recognized Him at the first Passover (Exodus 12). As the Israelites sprinkled their doorposts with the blood of a spotless lamb, they were acting out the gospel. When the angel of death passed over God’s people because of the blood of that lamb, God was shooting up a beacon of hope throughout history. Jesus’ blood would soon save us from death’s wrath in much the same way. Our sin would be passed over because of Christ’s sacrifice on our behalf. \n\nAs I read about the scarlet cord Rahab the prostitute threw from her window as a sign of deliverance (Joshua 2), I saw the gospel thread there too. For I am a sinner who deserves destruction, yet Christ’s blood is the symbol that I shall be delivered from my enemies and some day live at peace with God’s people in the promised land. Here, in Micah 5, we find a prophet picking up the needle and threading it with the gospel story once again. \n\nWe’ve seen enough kids’ Christmas programs to recognize the significance of Bethlehem. It is the spot on the map where Christ was born in a stable “for there was no place for them in the inn” (Luke 2:7). We’ve probably also seen Jesus painted as a shepherd in a Sunday school classroom or two. There are enough dots here for us to connect and realize that Micah is prophesying about Jesus. But let’s look at Micah’s words again, searching for every fray of that gospel thread. Don’t race past this. The implications are too wonderful: \n\n“But you, O Bethlehem… from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from old, from ancient days… and he shall be their peace.”\n– Micah 5:2, 5\n\nJesus was always at work to come and rescue us, from the moment He poured the foundations of the earth. Way back in the ancient of days, He was already riding toward us with redemption on His mind. Christ’s sacrifice for the sins of man was always Plan A. No Plan B is necessary. \n\nWhen I worry my sin might make the gospel give way, when I secretly fear I’m the one sinner whose brokenness grace isn’t big enough to cover, I can open God’s Word and trace the gospel thread back to the start. There I find Jesus, the Hero throughout the ages, who always had a plan to win me back, and I see that hope was always on the way. We were never for one nanosecond without the promise of it.\n\n",

Unfortunately, no one relayed this message to my kerchief-wearing, popcorn-selling, Eagle Scout of a little brother.\n\nWith socks to his knees and badges across his chest, he’d proudly hold up his fingers, reciting the Boy Scout motto every night before brushing his teeth. His newfound pack became his identity, and while it didn’t earn him a swarm of girlfriends, it certainly brought the shy boy out of his shell. He threw himself into first aid, emergency preparedness, environmental science, and camping, checking off as many merit badge requirements as possible.\n\nIn Micah 6, that’s exactly what the Israelites were hoping for: a checklist for how to please God. They had failed at manufacturing goodness for themselves, and their idols hadn’t produced any fruit. Assuming the answer was to work harder, they wondered when God would ever be satisfied with what they had to offer.\n\nIsrael wanted to earn their ranking in faith through burnt offerings, year-old calves, rams, and streams of oil, but even these expensive gifts were not an equal trade for righteousness. And the instructions God provided were not what they expected. \n\n“Mankind, he has told you what is good\nand what it is the Lᴏʀᴅ requires of you:\nto act justly,\nto love faithfulness,\nand to walk humbly with your God.”\n– Micah 6:8\n\nUpon hearing these words from the prophet, I bet the Israelites were ready to tie their kerchiefs around their necks and get to work achieving their merit badges with God. But looking at the specific commands, we can guess they became a little confused when they realized everything had already been accomplished. Their assigned tasks were not primarily about their own sacrifice, strength, or anything else the Israelites could offer. They were simply called to mirror the character of God. \n\nInstead of just giving them rules to follow, He pointed forward to the work He’d later accomplish on the cross.\n\nWe, like Israel, forget that the only merit we have is the blood of the Messiah.\n\nWe can only act justly because we have been justified through Christ.\n\nWe can only love faithfulness because He defined it for us on the cross.\n\nWe can only walk humbly because His footsteps went before us.\n\nWe can only be with our God because Christ joined us to Him.\n\nThe only thing left on our to-do list is to worship the God who does not change. May we fear His name alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Micah 7:1-20, Psalm 103:8-9, Romans 6:12-14\n\nBoth my husband and I are mostly unemployed. I’m trying not to be anxious about it. We are here on purpose. We left our jobs so we could have freedom to spend time with our kids and create art together. And we have a lot of ideas, but nothing has panned out yet. As I watch our savings descend further and further from black to red, I try to stay focused on positively creating something new instead of choking with panic and imagining my children begging for food.\n\nWhen we try out a new idea, and it doesn’t yield any results, we feel defeated and isolated. Defeat and isolation are paralyzing emotions we all feel in different ways. One of my smallest sons feels total defeat when he gets shampoo in his eyes, and deep isolation if everyone else has already had a snack without him.\n\nWhether you are looking for a job or a snack, feeling alone can be terrifying. And Micah’s isolation was chilling on both a physical and spiritual level. He actually had real and profound reasons to feel alone. He believed there was no one left, and howled out, “Faithful people have vanished from the land; there is no one upright among the people” (Micah 7:2). He felt defeated and searched for a few good men, but he couldn’t find even one.\n\nMicah saw corruption in every corner. You know the old saying about “they get you coming and going”? Micah must have felt the same way—like there was no safe place, no one he could trust. When he reaches out to the best men he can find, he discovers them to be more like razor blades than friends (Micah 7:4).\n\nRemember how Elijah, after his victory at Mt. Carmel, looked around and despaired, believing that he was the only faithful man left in Israel. While he felt alone, God assured him that there were yet 7000 left in Israel who refused to bend their knees to Baal (1 Kings 18:16-45). Still, for both Micah and Elijah, the skies looked very dark, their hearts felt alone, and their vision felt dim. But darkness is not dark to God. He does not leave His people alone, and His vision never falters. No matter how alone we feel, there is still hope.\n\nEven in his darkness, Micah knows the truth. He declares that our only hope, our only safe confidant is the Lord (Micah 7:7). And we know that He cares, not just abstractly or on our birthdays, but presently. He invites us into ongoing relationship with Him even now (Micah 6:3-5). He does not leave us alone, even at night, even when we’re unemployed, even when we’re hungry.\n\nMicah urges those who still sit in darkness to cling to the God of salvation, the God who hears. No matter how dark the night, hope is close at hand: “though I sit in darkness, the Lord will be my light” (Micah 7:8).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessica Lamb\n\nScripture Reading: Nahum 1:1-15, 2 Kings 19:8–19\n\n“God is great, God is good, let us thank Him for our food.”  \n\nI don’t remember when I was first taught this prayer, but I do remember spending my childhood cheerfully chanting it each week in Sunday School over clear Dixie cups half filled with trail mix and graham crackers. This simple prayer was replaced by others as I grew older, but the essential truth it teaches about God in its opening line remains the same.\n\nGod is great. He is powerful, sovereign, and holy. We see this on full display in the opening verses of Nahum. Back in the book of Jonah, we read about Nineveh—how God responded with forgiveness and grace when the people of the city humbled themselves before God and turned away from their evil deeds.\n\nBut in the years after that deliverance, Nineveh, a city in the brutal, domineering nation of Assyria, had turned turned back to its sin. The redemptive work of God in their city was forgotten. In 2 Kings 2:10, we read how their king, Sennacherib, mocked the living God and His promises with a taunt: “Don’t let your God, on whom you rely, deceive you… will you be rescued?”\n\nIn Nahum chapter 1, the prophet shares God’s response to the actions of this unrepentant people: judgment will come to Nineveh. Our great God is just, slow to anger but righteous in dealing with sin, oppression, and plots against Him (vv.3,9).\n\nI sometimes feel whispers of Sennacherib’s taunt slipping into my thoughts as I read the Minor Prophets. The descriptions of the greatness of God remind me of my own rebellion, my own sinful nature. And so I wonder, Is this God I claim to rely on really to be trusted? Will I really be rescued? But the declaration of Nahum 1:7 drowns out those whispers:\n\n“The LORD is good,\na stronghold in a day of distress;\nhe cares for those who take refuge in him.”\n\nThis verse reminds us that God’s greatness is entwined with another essential truth: God is good. He is close to His people, a stronghold in days of distress. He is compassionate and gracious, abounding in mercy and kindness (Psalm 86:15). He is faithful even when we are not (2 Timothy 2:13). Through the work of Jesus, God invites us to know Him and belong to Him—extending the invitation even while we were sinners, rescuing us from suffering, despair, and the punishments our sins deserve (Romans 5:8). \n\nThis is our God, and He is always fully Himself. While passages like the judgment of Nineveh in Nahum show us the devastating consequences of sin, they also paint a picture of a God who is fully just, fully loving, and fully good in His response to wayward hearts and brokenness. \n\nAs we read through these Minor Prophets, we’ll read about God’s character, how He is present and active. He mourns, hurts, and acts in righteous anger. He comforts, rebukes, and restores. God reveals all this and more to us through His Word, which has the power to change us as we reflect on who He is: a God who is great, good, and fully invested in His people.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Nahum 2:1-13, Nahum 3:1-19, 2 Chronicles 32:9-23\n\nThe book of Nahum is the second act of a well-known story—the story of Jonah, a prophet chosen by God to go to the city of Nineveh to call its unrepentant people to God. But despite God’s calling, Jonah did not go to Nineveh; he went to the sea, was swallowed by a fish, and was eventually regurgitated. THEN he went to Nineveh, told the people to repent, and they did.\n\nHowever, the Ninevites’ repentance didn’t last long. Nineveh was the capital of Assyria, and Assyria was a terrible place. In an effort to describe Assyria, biblical scholars and historians have used words such as “cruel” and “arrogant,” “violent” and “tortuous.” This was a nation founded on bloodshed and established by massacre.\n\nAssyria had conquered Israel, the land of God’s people. The Israelites were exiled, their cities burned, and they were filled with sorrow and lament. All the while, Assyria’s power grew through oppression and violence. It was a superpower standing on a terrible foundation.\n\nNahum prophesies the destruction of Assyria in this short book, full of vivid images of violence. His sarcastic tone emphasizes his mocking of the Assyrians and is punctuated by the joy of the people who would “clap their hands” at the news of Assyria’s destruction (Nahum 3:19). Their oppressors would be destroyed.\n\nWhich is why, as hard as it is to remember, God had sent the Assyrians to overtake Israel initially. We see it in 2 Kings 17:6 and again in Isaiah 8:6–8:\n\n“Because these people rejected\nthe slowly flowing water of Shiloah…\nthe Lord will certainly bring against them\nthe mighty rushing water of the Euphrates River—\nthe king of Assyria and all his glory.\nIt will overflow its channels\nand spill over all its banks.\nIt will pour into Judah,\nflood over it, and sweep through,\nreaching up to the neck;\nand its flooded banks\nwill fill your entire land, Immanuel!”\n\nIsrael felt the consequences of their disobedience. And then their oppressors felt the wrath of God. The through line here is that God demands justice. Ecclesiastes 12:14 says, “For God will bring every act to judgment, including every hidden thing, whether good or evil.” The Old Testament sings of His faithfulness and mercy but also His impervious commitment to justice. God’s justice is bound up with His holiness and is part of the fabric of His universe. And His justice is satisfied in Christ alone.\n\nIn Isaiah 9, right after God’s declaration to send Assyria to overtake Israel, He makes a promise: a child would be born, a son would be given. A promise of a government and peace that would have no end (v.6).\n\nGod knew that the only way to satisfy His desire for justice was to send His Son—Himself—to stand in the place of His people. The God who warned, “Beware, I am against you. This is the declaration of the LORD of Armies” (Nahum 2:13), would turn that anger against Himself. His need for justice would be satisfied once for all time in the death of His Son. That Son would rise again, defeating death, with a promise to return and bring a peace that will have no end.\n\nCome, Lord Jesus!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Habakkuk 1:1-17, Psalm 13:1-6, Acts 13:40-41\n\nIt wasn’t until I was in college studying grammar and literature that I realized something: the word “wait” is an action verb. Something is happening, something is in motion—even when the word itself implies stasis. To wait on someone means to serve them by being actively present, even without words. In Habakkuk 1, waiting abounds. The people of God are waiting for an answer, and God is waiting until the time is right. Neither wait is wrong, still, or without action. \n\nHabakkuk says the law is “paralyzed, and justice never goes forth” (1:4, ESV). To God’s people, it feels as though they are stuck in the perpetual motion of law-keeping, not seeing any hope of the future God has promised them. They stand, waiting and begging, imploring the God of the universe to hear and answer and save. \n\nGod is also waiting, and His waiting is perfect within His predetermined time. He is not being pushed to any limit, and He is not worried about being too early or too late. He is present, even though He may appear silent. And His waiting is good, even though it may feel punitive to His people. \n\nI’m sure you’re waiting for something today. Just in the time I’ve written these last three paragraphs, three different individuals I know walked up to me here, at the coffee shop where I’m working. Each lamented different things they have begged God to see and act on, yet they feel He has remained silent toward their suffering.\n\nI am waiting for things, too. We are all waiting for something, and it can be very tempting to believe we are the only ones waiting. We can feel paralyzed in the waiting, left feeling that God is either ignorant of our pleas or intentionally avoiding an answer for us. But wait is a verb, and it is not one without action. God is at work in your waiting, and you are at work in it, too. Cry out to Him like Habakkuk, asking:\n\n“How long, LORD, must I call for help\nand you do not listen\nor cry out to you about violence\nand you do not save?” (v.2).\n\nDo not be afraid to bring Him your questions and emotion. God can handle your fear. He is rock solid and unchanging, but He is also acting, right now, on behalf of His children.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Habakkuk 2:1-20, Proverbs 29:18, Hebrews 10:32-39\n\nLet’s be honest. Sin can be entertaining as a spectator sport. There’s a certain draw to the grit and gore of sin in the lives of other people, isn’t there? At first glance, Habakkuk 2 reads like a cage match to me. God calls out a series of sins, and we’re tempted to sit on the sidelines, cheering, while munching on popcorn. \n\n“Woe to the thief and extortionist!” (v.6, my paraphrasing).\n\nGet em, God! we cry.\n“Woe to the crook in his big, fancy house!” (v.9).\n\nTake him down a few notches! we say with a smirk.\n“Woe to the murderers and crime bosses!” (v.12).\n\nMake them pay! we heckle.\n“Woe to the drug dealer, the keg provider, the predator!” (v.15).\n\nLet ‘em have it! we roar.\n“Woe to the mystic!” (v.19).\n\nWe’re right, and they’re wrong! we boast.\n\nBut wait—look again. This passage isn’t punctuated with the celebration of the “righteous.” There are no “Atta, girls!” for us here. God follows the woes with a dose of truth, one that makes my eyes drop to the floor and my knees weak:\n\n“But the LORD is in his holy temple;\nlet the whole earth\nbe silent in his presence” (v.20).\n\nThe holiness of God is a spotlight none of us can bear. It isn’t just pointed toward the crooks and the cowards. It illuminates our sin, and then suddenly we don’t feel much like cheering anymore. Coming face to face with God’s holiness, His righteousness, we are silenced by the weight of our sin and our desperate need for mercy. Instead of screaming, “Woe to you!” our sin compels us to respond more like the prophet Isaiah: \n\n“Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty”\n\n(Isaiah 6:5, NIV).\n\nWe are a people prone to rebellion against the loving laws of God. We are more likely to obsess over our own reflection than the image of God we bear. We are selfish, self-reliant, and scared. We are shattered by sin, and there is not enough glue in the universe to repair us. And no matter how hard we try, we cannot clean ourselves up or drum up enough righteousness to stand before a holy God. Woe to us. \n\nThat’s the truth we must acknowledge before we can truly live out of the forgiveness and grace of our Savior, the grace we all need so desperately. Thank God, He gives it so generously to all nations and people groups (Titus 2:11). One day the whole earth will know the Lord’s glory (Habakkuk 2:14), but the ground will always be level at the foot of the cross. The gospel bids us to gather there—the thieves and the theologians, the swindlers and the savers, the predators and the preachers. We are all guilty, and our sin levels the playing field. But so does God’s grace. \n\nWe are sinners turned saints, orphans turned heirs. We were unrighteous, but now we are clothed in Christ’s righteousness. Blessed are we! The new covenant silences us once again, but this time our mouths aren’t silenced in fear. Instead, we are made speechless by the goodness of our grace-giving God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Habakkuk 3:1-19, Psalm 17:1-15, John 1:14-18, Galatians 3:11\n\nThe Broadway show, Mean Girls, is a spectacle. Hot pink and glitter, blonde hair and high-pitched voices—I saw them everywhere under the stage’s bright spotlight. As the play began, my eyes landed on Regina’s mother (played by Amy Poehler in the movie version). When her “Queen Bee” daughter arrives home with friends, the mother says: “There are no rules in this house! I’m not like a regular mom. I’m a cool mom.” Then she winks.\n\nRegina’s mother is a laughing stock. Out all of the kids in the movie, Regina needs a strong parent the most. And in trying to be the “cool” mom, she’s actually no mother at all. Her well-timed wink is proof of her weakness. \n\nI say this because we live in a time that would very much like for God to be a “cool” God. If He is all-forgiving, we suppose He is all-accommodating too. But we don’t have a God who winks at evil. In this passage in Habakkuk, we’re given explosive imagery, like a fresh pair of glasses with which to see God. Take the time to read the passage out loud and really envision the scene. \n\nAs I read this chapter, I imagine God standing in the midst of a city, turning His head back and forth, searching for something. He stomps through the earth, on the hunt. His brilliance is like light. Rays are flashing from His hand. Pestilence surrounds His feet. As I read Habakkuk 3 with this image in mind, a picture of God, I wonder, Should I fall in love with Him, or should I be afraid of Him?\n\nI think the author of Habakkuk wants us to feel that tension. Because God is attractive, He draws us to Him. But He is also terrifying. Whether we’re about to be saved or destroyed, the same thing is true: God is worthy of our awe (Habakkuk 3:2). In His presence, our mouths should drop open; He is worthy of our rapt attention.\n\nBut what is He doing in this passage? What is He after? Our answer can be found right in the middle of the chapter where the prophet tells us why God is on a rampage: “You come out to save Your people, to save Your anointed” (v.13).\n\nIn this book of poetry, I see God as a fierce fighter trampling wickedness, turning His head to the left and right, all in order to find and save me. This is such great news! God is not angry with me; He is angry with evil. God is not on a mission to destroy me; He is on a mission to destroy His enemies. That is why the last few verses of this chapter are so very powerful. Can I write my own version? Can you?\n\nEven if cancer takes the ones I love away\nEven if my marriage falters and fails\nEven if the house is empty of children forever\nEven if my career is cut short\nEven if my bank account is nearing zero\nEven if all I see is sorrow and pain and destruction—\nEven then I will rejoice in the Lord.\nI will trust Him.\n\nI will wait quietly for God to do His work, confident in His goodness and His timing.\n\nNo, God does not wink at our sin. But He loves His children, and He holds us in His arms, even as His feet stomp out the worst of the evil in this world.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Great Day of the Lord",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Zephaniah 1:1-18, Romans 9:19-24, 2 Peter 3:8-10\n\n“The day of the Lord…” \n\nThere are lots of passages throughout Scripture pointing to “the day of the Lord” as judgment, like Isaiah 13:6, which instructs the reader to “Wail! For the day of the LORD is near.” The instruction to “wail” suggests some sort of reckoning. But there are other passages that speak of a joyous day: “Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God, because his judgments are true and righteous” (Revelation 19:1–2).\n\nThe day of the Lord seems to be a culmination of things, when God will set all things aright. It is a day of judgment against wickedness—those who will not humble themselves will be humbled—and a day of salvation for those who love God. So our understanding of this event really depends on which camp we’re in; it all comes back to the saving grace of Jesus.\n\nThe prophecy we read in Zephaniah 1 is deeply troubling, thick with wrath, destruction, and a distressing commentary on our inability to save ourselves. The prophet’s words remind us of the great and awesome nature of God; He is not to be trifled with, and He will not be mocked. He will not leave sin unpunished, nor will He be placated with cheap offerings or empty lip service. He is a holy God, and He will purify all creation from the stain of wickedness. When the day of the Lord comes, those who have given their hearts over to the things of this world will be brought low.\n\nThat’s an uncomfortable idea. It requires us to examine our own hearts and ask ourselves, Am I like those who pledge loyalty to the Lord, while at the same time pledging loyalty to the world? Do I really long to see the goodness of the Lord above all else? We simply cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24). When we consider the day of the Lord, we ought to be driven to repentance.\n\nI am struck by these words in Zephaniah 1:7: “The LORD has prepared a sacrifice; he has consecrated his guests.” This would have been a familiar image to the Jews, because they understood what regular sacrifices in the temple entailed. Each sacrifice was a twofold sign: an image of God’s holy burning wrath against sin, and a reminder that God would provide a substitute payment for His people. Here, even in the midst of Zephaniah’s terrible warning, is a reminder of God’s just wrath poured out on Christ. \n\nThat was a day of judgment, of wrath and distress, of darkness and gloom, when Christ’s blood was poured out on our behalf. Even now, “the great day of the LORD is near, near and rapidly approaching” (Zephaniah 1:14). May knowing this truth lead us to repentance. May it lead us to Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Zephaniah 2:1-15, Psalm 27:7-10, Romans 11:1-6\n\nOftentimes, I find myself deeply influenced by other people rather than by Jesus. I scroll Instagram and find new recipes, new decorating tips, new fashion ideas, and myriad examples of my self-assigned inadequacy. It’s dangerous, because it draws me deeper into the trappings of this world and further away from pinning all my hope on the person and work of Christ. \n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with Insta-inspiration or the longing for beauty that it stirs up within me. But that longing for beauty will never be satisfied outside of eternity, outside of the God who created beauty.  \n\nZephaniah chapter 2 opens with a call to repentance for the people of God, who had succumbed to the lure of the idols of their pagan neighbors. The passage addresses Israel but focuses on the impending judgment of Israel’s enemies. The first two verses strike straight into my heart: \n\n“Gather yourselves together;\ngather together, undesirable nation,\nbefore the decree takes effect\nand the day passes like chaff,\nbefore the burning of the LORD’s anger overtakes you,\nbefore the day of the LORD’s anger overtakes you.”\n\nIn the original Hebrew text, the word “goy” is used for the word “nation”—a word typically used to identify nations other than Israel. We know, however, that in these verses, the prophet is addressing Israel, specifically. So why use “goy”? Because Israel had become so influenced by the surrounding pagan nations that she had become like one of them: more pagan than godly. \n\nThe lure of idols brought Israel to the brink of destruction. My idols are not made of gold, nor do I worship them in pagan temples, but I am so desperately drawn to the fleeting beauty of the material world. I chase after it. I demand it. I see what my neighbors have, and I want more and better. From the outside, I’m sure I appear more worldly than godly—an assertion I really cannot deny. \n\nGod set aside the people of Israel for Himself, for His glory. But they turned away from Him and toward the gleaming idols of their pagan neighbors. He has called me to Himself. I am so thankful He did, and I’m grateful for the reminder today to keep my heart focused on Jesus and His glory, not the glories of this world.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Zephaniah 3:1-20, Isaiah 30:18, Hebrews 7:22-28\n\n“Woe to the city that is rebellious and defiled, the oppressive city!” declares Zephaniah (3:1). Woe is a scary word, isn’t it? It is a word used to indicate deep grief and calamity. It is a declaration of impending ruin, tidings of bad times to come. Who wants to talk about woeful tidings? I’d rather talk about joyful ones (Isaiah 9:6). But here in Zephaniah 3, the word woe is offered as a relief because it signals the end of injustice and the dawn of righteousness and hope.\n\nGod’s rebuke of Jerusalem centers on its inversion of justice and injustice. Leaders, prophets, and priests are supposed to uphold justice, not instigate injustice, right? But that’s just what they are guilty of, and so God’s rebuke is followed by a series of specific indictments. The rulers of the city are characterized as lions who devour, rather than shepherds who protect. The prophets are reckless, not wise. The priests are profane, not holy. And when God confronts them, their response is not repentance, but increased corruption. All of this sounds a little convicting and familiar.\n\nBut God “applies his justice morning by morning; he does not fail at dawn” (v.5). He cannot abide continuing injustice, but restores righteousness. Woe to those who persist in doing injustice! The final fulfillment of God’s promise is found in Christ, who is the true King, Prophet, and Priest—just, wise, and holy.\n\nHis restoration, however, is not only a resetting of the social order; it’s also the transformation of a people, who will be marked by pure speech and wholehearted devotion to the Lord. Their sins will be washed away, and they will walk in humility, meekness, righteousness, and truthfulness before God. On His holy mountain, they will dwell in peace and security.\n\nThe contrasting images of woeful ruin and righteous security are often hard for us to grasp simultaneously, but we find them perfectly pictured in the image of God as a warrior who saves. His warfare is the warfare both of justice and of salvation. But He is not just a warrior who saves—He is a warrior who sings. In one of the most beautiful verses in the Bible, we read: \n\n“The LORD your God is among you,\na warrior who saves.\nHe will rejoice over you with gladness.\nHe will be quiet in his love.\nHe will delight in you with singing” (v.17).\n\nYou! With all your injustices and vices, and in spite of your failings—when God looks at you, He sees Christ’s perfect righteousness. He rejoices over you with gladness, delight, and singing. Thanks be to God for both His justice and His love. Hear His faithful promises today, and let your heart be quieted and calmed by His love.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Command to Rebuild the Temple",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Haggai 1:1-15, Ezra 4:24-5:5, Ephesians 2:19-22\n\nPractically speaking, the Israelites had good reason to put off building the temple. It wasn’t too far in the past that Babylon had burned the first one to the ground. They feared that if they put all of their time, money, and political capital into rebuilding it, it might end up being a waste in the end. What if someone else came and destroyed it again? In response, they lived safe, small lives that created little of lasting value. But then Haggai arrived with a word from the Lord, and twice he says to God’s people, “Consider your ways” (Haggai 1:5, ESV).\n\nConsider your ways. Think carefully about what you do and why you do it.\n\nWhen I consider my ways, I realize that like the people of Israel, I spend time farming in fields that bear no real fruit in my life. I pour money and resources into things that are temporary—things that, though opulent, never feel like enough. I dress my spiritual wounds with consumer comforts. I go to quick-fixes, partly because they seem to temporarily work, and partly because I’ve been conditioned to reach for them without even thinking. I spend a lot less time considering, and more time acting out of compulsion. Much like the Israelites, I often feel like my money goes into a “bag with holes” (v.6). \n\nYikes. Sorry, God. \n\nIt would be easy to stop there and conclude that this passage is meant to encourage me to be more holy with the way I spend money. But is that what Haggai is saying? Is the point to give more to charity and stop wasting time? Maybe. Lord knows I have work to do in those arenas. But I think there’s more to what God is saying here. Over and over again throughout Scripture, the Lord invites His people to give Him everything—not because He is angry with them or needs something from them, but because He wants to prove Himself trustworthy. \n\nIn this story, God doesn’t leave His people to build the temple alone. He gives them His presence. He tells them, “I am with you” (v.13), and He doesn’t stop there. Along with His presence, He provides for them abundantly. Though the Israelites are willing to sacrifice their hard-earned money to build the temple, God works a bureaucratic miracle, and King Darius ends up paying for the whole thing!\n\nThough it is terrifying to risk everything, our God delights in filling our empty hands. God didn’t need Israel’s finances—He wanted their faith. He was less concerned about their wallets and more concerned with their willingness to take Him at His Word. He pointed out the powerlessness of their pennies in order to wake them up to their purpose.\n\nAt the beginning of this story, the Israelites looked at rebuilding the temple like powering through a spreadsheet, a to-do list. By the end, they’ve experienced what it’s like to live with the resources of a holy, all-powerful God. It’s exciting to serve a God this big, this extravagant and trustworthy. He asks me to consider my small ways, and then He invites me into His bigger, more miraculous plans for my life. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Haggai 2:1-23, Romans 8:9-10, Hebrews 12:26\n\nI suppose we’re all a little skeptical in the promises department. We feel like we need some collateral when someone makes one. But as a woman, as a Christ-follower, and as a broken person in desperate need of healing—nothing has changed me more than the Word of God, and more specifically, His promises to His people.\n\nAs the scattered Israelites stared at their ruined temple, God’s promises, voiced through Haggai, must have seemed impossible. And yet He fulfilled His promises in ways they never could have fathomed. Jesus would one day restore the temple. In fact, He would become the temple (John 2:19). \n\nHe will keep His promises to us too. Everywhere we see destruction in our lives, we will one day see restoration. Where we feel only brokenness, we will one day experience healing. The grief we know so intimately now will one day be replaced with deep, lasting joy. Right now, this very moment, Jesus is working to make all things new. It won’t be long now. \n\nDeath will die. Tears will dry. All brokenness will mend. And where we currently see rubble, we will see a world re-built on the bedrock promises of God. \n\nWhen? In the words of the Lord Himself, “in a little while” (Haggai 2:6). The time between this moment and the fulfillment of the beautiful promises of God is short. On the radar screen of eternity, the time between now and the realization of His promises is just a blip. And as we wait, He tells us, “My Spirit is present among you; don’t be afraid” (Haggai 2:5; see also Romans 8:10). His words are not just an encouragement, but a promise too.\n\nBased on the evidence of their current circumstances, the Israelites had reason to believe that God had abandoned them and reneged on His promises. Yet through the prophet Haggai, God reminded them to get their eyes off the brokeness because He is a God who comes through. If they’d only turn toward Him, they would see it! The call is the same for us, to lift our eyes from the brokenness inside us and all around us. We can look forward with great hope because God’s promises are true! \n\n“For people swear by something greater than themselves, and for them a confirming oath ends every dispute. Because God wanted to show his unchangeable purpose even more clearly to the heirs of the promise, he guaranteed it with an oath, so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us” (Hebrews 6:16–18). \n\nHung on a cross, Jesus chose to die for us. His finished work there is our collateral. We are a broken yet redeemed people, stitched together with a promise. There is something better coming. It won’t be long now. Just a little while. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Plea for Repentance",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nFrom beginning to end, the Bible tells the story of God’s redemptive plan. Zechariah’s prophecies anticipate the grand culmination of history, describing a coming glorious king and a world where everything is set right. While Zechariah prophesies judgment for the wicked, his message is filled with hope and glorious promises for God’s people.\n\nZechariah’s eight visions portend restoration for the righteous and punishment for the unrepentant. At the heart of these prophecies is the promise that the Lord is the one who enables repentance. The message of Zechariah’s first three night visions amounts to one urgent directive: repent.\n\nFirst, we see an angel (some scholars suggest this is a figure of Christ) standing among the myrtle trees, sending out messengers to do His will, speaking words of comfort and love for God’s people. He promises restoration and mercy, offering an invitation to come back to Him: “Return to me… and I will return to you” (Zechariah 1:3). \n\nSome people hold up an image of the God of the Old Testament as being angry all the time, but that’s a false image—one that’s quite inconsistent with Scripture as a whole. No matter where we turn in the pages of the Bible, we will find a God who is holy and who hates evil, but simultaneously loves His creation and offers abundant mercy to all who will heed His tender offer. And that’s what we see in Zechariah.\n\nThe second vision is of the might of Judah’s oppressors, which appear as horns. But their oppression is short-lived, as craftsmen approach and quickly dismantle their power. The third vision is of a surveyor, measuring the city of Jerusalem, the city of God’s people. Here, we again see God’s abundant mercy and blessing, as God’s people, set free from their captivity, have their dwelling place with God.\n\nIf we’d lived in Zechariah’s day, we, too, would have a long list of grievances to call our courage into question. The temple, whose foundations had been laid by the returning Jewish exiles, remained incomplete—a seemingly hopeless, abandoned project. Prophets had come and gone, but their words had made little effect. The people of Judah still did not seem to have a vision for a restored kingdom, and instead intermingled with the world around them. \n\nHave you also looked about and found discouragement in your world? Have you seen a lackluster church or half-hearted believers? Perhaps you have found these same roots of a sluggish faith in your own heart and are discouraged. Here is the good news: Christ, the Lord of Armies, comes to us, riding on a white horse. He has come to unseat the power of the oppressor and to set free the captives. He beckons to the sluggish, Come out of Babylon! (Zechariah 2:7). Christ the Lord of hosts has come to dwell with His people, bringing joy and gladness! (v.10).\n\nOften our great discouragement comes from fixing our eyes on the woes of the world and the trepidations of our heart, rather than fixing our eyes upon Christ. The anger of the Lord of armies is a call to bring us back home. Zechariah reminds us that our vision is to be fixed upon Him alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nWe adopted two of our sons from Ethiopia nine years ago today. It has been a long journey for all of us, and I am so glad that I’m nine years down this road and not back at the starting line. As soon as we leapt over that starting line and landed on the ground in Africa, I thought I was probably going to die. We later realized I was just pregnant with baby number four. When the nannies thrust two sweet, sad, screaming boys at us we realized we were massively unprepared. \n\nThe early part of our adoption story is filled with diapers, fungi, and giardia. I remember how I longed to have all of the filth removed from my children and my home, but it seemed an unending struggle. And our boys couldn’t fix it themselves. Those sweet babies needed love, and sometimes latex-gloved hands, to help them out.\n\nJust like helpless, sick toddlers from an orphanage with no running water, we, too, came to Christ dressed in filthy clothes. And we couldn’t get free of it on our own. Notice that in the fourth vision from today’s reading, the Lord doesn’t say to Joshua, “Get yourself cleaned up!” but instead “Take off his filthy clothes!” (Zechariah 3:4). He needed someone to do it for him, and so do we.\n\nChrist removes our iniquity, and then He clothes us in festive robes (v.4). I love how the gospel gives us a total turn-around. He could have replaced filthy garments with a reasonable and sensible second-hand T-shirt. That’s certainly better than where we were. But Christ loves us and dresses us in the best He has to offer. He washes us clean and elevates us from the gutter to His right hand, like true sons and daughters.\n\nNot only are our filthy rags removed, but we are made to dwell in the shadow of His covering, where we, now filled with the joy of the good news of the gospel, may invite our neighbors to also find rest (v.10). And as sons and daughters, we are invited to walk in His way and keep His mandates (v.7). \n\nJust as we are unable to make ourselves clean by our own scrubbing, we are also dependent upon Him and His constant character. Our newness of life is achieved “not by strength or by might, but by my Spirit” (Zechariah 4:6). God is the one who makes the mountains a plain (v.7) and removes all obstacles. In this case, Zechariah prophesied the seemingly impossible completion of the temple. But in its true fulfillment, Christ establishes His temple and makes the mountains into plains (Isaiah 40:4). He alone breaks down the barriers of sin, and declares us righteous, a fit dwelling place for His Spirit. \n\nAnd, newly cleansed, we will see that just as the temple completion in restored Jerusalem was the work of God alone, so also the conversion of our hearts and the cleansing of our guilt is achieved through grace (Zechariah 4:7).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI definitely do not want my living room to be visited by a giant flying scroll. I do not want to see a shrine built to the basket o’ wickedness. And I feel quite uneasy about dappled horses patrolling north, west, east, and south. The visions God gave to Zechariah can be both creative and terrifying. They reveal how God shows kindness to His people while bringing judgment to the wicked. Puritan commentator Matthew Henry reminds us that while the pillar of fire in Egypt was a beacon of promise to Israel, it was a swirling black portent to the Egyptians.\n\nWe tend to think of judgment as only that which follows sin, but whenever God allows people to devote themselves to wickedness, that also is a judgment. God sends the basket of wickedness to Shinar—the land of Babylon—and it is placed upon a shrine to be worshiped. In other words, He is telling His people that if it’s evil and wickedness they want, they can return to Babylon. But make no mistake: there is no good thing in that basket, only wickedness. Or they can choose to stay in Judah and return to the Lord. He is coming, and He will keep His promises.\n\nVisions and prophecies are difficult to interpret—that is one thing commentators and biblical scholars can agree on. However, one thing is clear: The Lord is the Lord of the whole earth. All the lands are His, and His ministers roam to and fro, doing His bidding. He alone is Lord and God. And that is truly comforting to His people, because He is a good God.\n\nZechariah looked to see what was approaching, and though the images are striking, the substance of His visions fits with what we already know of the gospel. The final image here is of the crowned priest-king who “will build the LORD’s temple; he will be clothed in splendor and will sit on his throne and rule… People who are far off will come and build the LORD’s temple, and you will know that the LORD of Armies has sent me to you (Zechariah 6:13,15). The reign of righteousness established by the Branch is a foreshadowing of Christ, the true Priest-King, who alone “fully obeys the Lord” (vv.9–15). No matter what our circumstances might look like, no matter what disappointments surround us, no matter how we’ve failed, our only hope is Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThis passage in Zechariah is beautiful. The people of Israel, just like all of us, keep missing the heart of the matter. For example, when I apologize to my husband for, say, driving the wheels of our bus into the tiny wall that separates the road from a 400-foot cliff drop in Glacier National Park, I’m tempted to just make a legalistic show of it. Once I’ve said the words, “I’m sorry,” I expect him to snap out of it, get back on the bus, and forgive me for my adventurous driving maneuvers. (The road was very narrow, you see.) We teach children this same formula of repentance: \n\n“Say you’re sorry.” \n“I’m sorry.” \n“Okay, I forgive you.”\n(Transaction complete.)\n\nBut just going through the motions of repentance does not true repentance make. In today’s passage, the residents of Bethel come to Jerusalem to ask about an upcoming fast. They’re prepared to go through the tired motions of keeping it, but they don’t mean it. Have you ever fasted “unto the Lord” but really just with an eye on your swimsuit-season prospects? Have you ever, like me, apologized with the goal of just getting on with it, instead of engaging in true sorrow and repentance over hurting someone?\n\nWe’ve all been on the receiving end of bad repentance and know what a mockery it is. Yet are we foolish enough to think that, somehow, by going through the motions, we can appease a holy and almighty God. God sees right through all of this, of course (Zechariah 7:5). He’s obviously not fooled by the sorry recitations of His people. But here’s the unexpected gorgeousness of His goodness: He doesn’t want to keep us fasting and dredging and reciting forever—these are just training tools. He wants to bring us into feasting and celebration. He wants us to reap goodness and abundance (8:12).\n\nThis is precisely why He calls His people to repent. Genuine repentance is never mere lip service. It is a transformation. It is a turning of heart, soul, mind, and strength from the folly and filth of sin to the hope and goodness of God. When the Lord of Armies declares His zeal and His jealousy for Jerusalem, it is a zeal and jealousy not only for His glory, but also for our good! The justice and mercy of God are not a contradiction, but a harmonious accord. Because of His faithful love, He would have us also “show faithful love and compassion to one another” (Zechariah 7:9). He comes to transform us, that we may be like Him, that we also may “love truth and peace” (8:19).\n\nHe is calling us away from fighting over the cereal on the floor under the kids’ table to join Him for the real meat and drink at the feast. He transforms us from petty and insincere beggars to dear children who dance and play in the congregation of His people (Zechariah 8:3–5). The fasting of genuine repentance, in God’s economy, always produces the joyful feast of salvation.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI like to be right. But it’s not always enough to be right. \n\nAs a child, I would pertly correct my little sister with bits of wisdom such as, “Frankenstein is actually the name of the doctor, so the monster could more accurately be called ‘Frankenstein’s monster.’” After that, my mom patiently explained to me that there is a difference between being right and being obnoxiously right. It’s important to know the difference, because even if the proper pluralization of “cul de sac” is actually “culs de sac,” you still kinda want to roll your eyes at someone for pointing it out. We’ve probably all been on the receiving end of someone else’s unsolicited commentary that is so obnoxiously right that they’re just wrong.\n\nChrist, on the other hand, is always right. He is the definition of right. But—and this is the amazing part—He is graciously right. The Lord conquers graciously. He does not conquer us and then commence with trash talk or years of making us feel inadequate. To be conquered by Him is to win the greatest victory of all time. Remember Jacob, wrestling the angel of the Lord at Peniel—he was injured but that was the only way to win the victory (Genesis 32:22–31).\n\nIn Zechariah 9, we see how the word of the Lord promises to come against the lands that surround His people, places renowned for their wickedness, like Tyre and Sidon. Though these nations and peoples have gathered temporal wealth, God will strip it all away. Though they have amassed the might of violent arms, their pride will be destroyed. Their wealth will be cast into the sea, and they will be “consumed by fire” (v.4). This is the language of God’s judgment against the wicked. \n\nBut a striking thing happens: when their kings have been removed, their strength has been destroyed, and their hope has failed, then God will turn and be gracious. He will even make of them a remnant, as He had with the clan of Judah.\n\nThe image of the great King of Zion, riding on the colt of a donkey is the perfect depiction of Christ, who wages war with an offer of peace, and destroys His enemies with His own death. He confounds the wisdom of the world, and undoes the reasoning of our own hearts. \n\n“Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion!  Shout in triumph, Daughter Jerusalem!  Look, your King is coming to you;  he is righteous and victorious.”  –Zechariah 9:9\n\nAll too often, the Old Testament judgments of God are misunderstood and characterized as vindictive and punitive. But Zechariah 9 is a reminder of the true nature of His judgment. While He does indeed detest idolatry and wickedness, His judgments cannot be separated from His love. \n\nI am reminded of C.S. Lewis’s statement in The Problem of Pain: “If God were proud He would hardly have us on such terms: but He is not proud, He stoops to conquer, He will have us even though we have shown that we prefer everything else to Him, and come to Him because there is ‘nothing better’ now to be had.” \n\nThe Creator of the universe has donned the garb of a servant to humbly wash the filth from our feet. As He did with Saul on the road to Damascus, our God comes to convert enemies into beloved children.\n\nHe stoops to conquer our hearts. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nReading well is all about understanding contexts. That’s what I tell my students. Otherwise, how are we to unpack images asking for spring rain, when we really think April showers have been a little too abundant this year? Why be concerned about not having a shepherd? You could just hire one from the local Christmas pageant. Even more puzzling: How do we muster up the imagination to envision a docile, aimless little flock of sheep turning into a mighty steed? And what about cornerstones and tent pegs? Needless to say, these aren’t typical, daily ponderings for most of us. \n\nBut before we get sidetracked by these images themselves, let’s remind ourselves of the main message behind them: No matter what, God’s people are to trust Him—specifically, to trust that He will bring us home. And that is what we’re longing for: home. We’re longing for stability—maybe that’s what the cornerstones and tent pegs are all about. We’re longing for families reconciled. (Did you notice the “houses” of Judah and Joseph coming together after long centuries of hostility?) We’re longing to be brought safely through troubled waters to arrive at home. \n\nThe first image drawn directly from Zechariah’s geographical context is embedded in numerous prophetic messages. In a part of the world where it generally rains only between October and March, those extra showers in April were (and are) a gift. In response to Israel’s obedience, God promised rain in its season, even mentioning the autumn and spring rains (Deuteronomy 11:13–15). Drought and famine, however, were always lurking around the seasonal corner if God’s people were disobedient (vv.16–17). \n\nThe invitation to ask God for the blessing of rain is followed by warnings against sliding into the deceitful orbit of household gods (teraphim) and diviners. We should not be tempted into thinking this warning was just for Israel—that is was their problem and not ours today. But not so fast. Sure, teraphim and diviners don’t show up much in our social media feeds these days, but the misplaced hope the people wholeheartedly placed in those practices is a little too familiar. \n\nDivination had everything to do with determining if the gods were going to show favor to them. Magic meant manipulating those presumed deities to get them to be favorable, to meet the people’s desires. The household gods were part of this network, too. Zechariah called them out on their behavior, telling them their self-serving “trust” lay in the wrong places. \n\nThen and now, it is God who gives blessing and assurance, with the ultimate purpose that we be a blessing to others. Diviners, whether ancient or modern-day, produce only emptiness and deceit. How about us? Where do we focus our attention as we seek a good and secure life? What are our cornerstones and tent pegs as we try to hold our fragile life structures together? Can we truly say that God indeed is our Cornerstone? That is essential to coming home and walking securely in the name of the Lord (Zechariah 10:12).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nWe have a tough lesson coming up, no matter how we try to soften the blow. When leaders neglect their responsibilities, the consequences are grave—for everyone, in every time and every place. The opening imagery of this chapter sweeps through mighty cedars, majestic cypresses, sturdy oaks of Bashan, and the thickets of the Jordan. All have come crashing to ruin, and how great is their fall! \n\nAgainst that devastating backdrop, the images shift to shepherds, a common figure for leaders in the Old Testament. It is important to make that connection because our “church-shaped” lens has relegated shepherds to the margins of society, which is where they had landed by the time of Jesus. Centuries before, however, shepherds in the ancient Near East had significant power and status because they controlled extensive sources of income: their flocks. \n\nZechariah’s bad shepherds—there were more than one—were missing some critical character traits. Good shepherds invested days and months of arduous labor as they migrated great lengths with their flocks to find food and water. In order to protect their sheep from threats of all kinds, they watched over them for long stretches of hours at a time. They cared for those that were diseased, and knew each sheep by name and touch. The shepherd’s staff was a symbol of care, giving assistance and direction, and of leadership and rescue. As Timothy Laniak states in his book While Shepherds Watch Their Flocks, good shepherds were skilled and trustworthy, “willing to take responsibility for the work,” whatever it may entail. \n\nThis description is a stark contrast to Zechariah’s harsh indictment of the shepherd God would appoint to bring judgment on the wayward people. He “does not care for those being destroyed, or seek the young or heal the maimed or nourish the healthy, but devours the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hooves” (Zechariah 11:16, ESV). No wonder the chapter ends with a pronouncement of woe over that shepherd who deserted the flock and gave up on them, in essence, saying, “let them all die or destroy each other” (v.9, my paraphrase). He broke his staff called Favor (symbolizing the end of covenant compassion and rescue), and then demanded his payment: thirty pieces of silver. Judas betrayed the ultimate Good Shepherd for the same price (Matthew 26:14–15; 27:3–10).\n\nThis is heart-wrenching for what it says about the human condition behind the imagery. Those who bought and sold were only concerned with the profit. It’s hard not to think of the modern-day scourge of global human trafficking. Which begs the question: How can thoughtful and compassionate leaders intervene to stop the utter dissolution of social structures originally designed for our protection? \n\nWhile this is a gloomy picture, to be sure, it would be incomplete without returning to the words of the Good Shepherd: “My sheep hear my voice, I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27). Jesus assures that no one is able to snatch those sheep out of the Father’s hand (vv.28–30).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nWhen we are being swept away by uncontrollable and terrifying circumstances, we search for an anchor, a declaration of truth, something we can cling to. This is true even when frightening events are relatively brief; their impact is felt long after that initial experience. The full force of this reality wallops us in this chapter of Zechariah. Jerusalem’s agony is palpable—a city in the path of violence, under siege, and attacked by all the nations. It’s hard to imagine the abject horror of their situation, especially for those of us who are blessed to live in peaceful, secure environments. \n\nIt’s no wonder then that the identity of the mighty Master of the Universe is pre-eminent. It is the Lord who stretched out the heavens, gave the earth its foundation, and shaped the spirits of humans, unpredictable though we may be. The clans of Judah, acting as a protective envelope around Jerusalem, emphatically restated this truth: “‘The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the Lord Almighty is their God’” (Zechariah 12:5). This is a perspective worth seizing, worth holding onto with all our might, especially when we feel beaten up. Our strength lies only in the Lord our God. \n\nThe people of Zechariah’s day knew their own recent history. Jerusalem had been under siege and the people had been taken captive to Babylon. This was the broken Jerusalem over which Jeremiah lamented (Lamentations 1:1–17). Some seventy years later, life in Jerusalem was still precarious. Even so, the prophet’s vision ranged far forward to a day of salvation and glory for Judah, for the house of David, and for Jerusalem. In the meantime, while Jerusalem would indeed be severely attacked, the people of the city would also be “a cup that causes staggering” and “a heavy stone” to all the surrounding nations (Zechariah 12:2–3). It’s a not-so-subtle warning to consider the consequences before attacking Jerusalem. \n\nBut now the picture takes an odd turn. The house of David and those who lived in Jerusalem would be compelled to plead for mercy as they look upon the Lord, the one they had pierced. That piercing reverberates into the crucifixion of Jesus (John 19:36–37). This sense of calamitous loss and deep need for repentance overwhelms any triumph that might have surfaced in the immediately prior events—and that is as it should be. \n\nJerusalem and the whole land would mourn, but the greater emphasis is on each “house” by itself—the house of David and his son, Nathan; the house of Levi and his descendant, Shimei. Echoes of kings and priests. Women, traditionally the mourners (Lamentations 2:5; Jeremiah 9:17–22), were intentionally separate and profoundly engaged in the repentance necessary for the forthcoming cleansing fountain (Zechariah 13:1). And clearly, there is more to come.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nAs you read this chapter, do you notice a radical shift part way through? First, the esteemed person of the prophet comes under fire. Then the focus swivels back to the enigmatic figure of the shepherd. Zechariah pronounced judgment on the prophets with just about the same contemptuous tone as he treated idols. Why take prophets to task in the first place? These, after all, were the men and women who were called to preach God’s revealed Word to the people, both to warn and to encourage them. It seems, however, something had gone awry. \n\nTo help us process this, we can easily look to our own contemporary churches. No, it’s not my intention to pummel the church with criticism. Instead, I’m just curious to discover good aspects of ministry that can go off track for one reason or another. Taking a closer look might just help us to be on guard in our home churches.\n\nTwo things come to mind. First, is music ministry, which has a long tradition of well-trained practitioners that can be traced back all the way to the excellent preparation of the Levites in ministry (1 Chronicles 25:1–7). The second is preaching, which carries on the same prophetic tradition mentioned above.\n\nSadly, lots of “stuff” often gets in the way of accomplishing good and noble goals—stuff that tends to revolve around egos and crowd-pleasing. Of course, we all suffer from these same kinds of human pitfalls in one way or another, so please know that I’m not trying to hunt down specks in the eyes of sisters and brothers in ministry while remaining blind to my own sin.\n\nBut back to the point: Do you see the connection, how these same nagging traits contributed to the rejection of the prophetic ministry we encounter in Zechariah? The prophets’ bad reputation was a carry-over from the steady stream of deceit uttered by false prophets in Jeremiah’s day, lulling the people to sleep instead of issuing wake-up calls. These false prophets told the people what they wanted to hear, which undermined Jeremiah’s warnings and pleas for repentance. At this point, you could say that parts of Jeremiah 23 sound a lot like Zechariah. Seventy years later, following a brutal exile, God’s people were still trying to put their lives back together. (May God spare us all from the sober consequences of crowd-pleasing preaching!) \n\nWith the dismissal of the prophets, the shepherd surfaces again. No longer called “worthless,” he is now close to the Lord Almighty. The next words from the Lord are the command to strike the shepherd, followed by the observation that the sheep would scatter, and the warning that God’s hand would be turned against those little ones (see Matthew 26:31). \n\nThis is difficult to read. Nevertheless, two allusions restore our hope. First, from our New Testament perspective, we know that the Good Shepherd promised to lay down His life for His sheep (John 10:11–18); Jesus said it four times. Second, even though the final image of the refining fire is terrifying, the end products are purified silver and gold. And through it all, we are God’s people, and He is our God (Zechariah 13:9). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nHonestly? I don’t know what to do with this chapter. From pillage to plague to panic—turns out the challenges for Jerusalem were not finally resolved in chapter 12. Attacks against it continue to ratchet up, but not for long. There is hope ahead: The Lord stands victorious on the Mount of Olives; a major seismic event shifts the mountain; there is strange, indescribable daylight; and water flows from Jerusalem east and west in all seasons. Echoing Ezekiel, pointing back to Eden, and looking forward to Revelation, this is the river of the water of life, nurturing fruitfulness and healing, and ending the curse (Ezekiel 47:1–12; Revelation 22:1–5).\n\nSomewhere along the way, Jerusalem will be secured—for good—and survivors from the nations that were attacking the city will experience an about-face and will come to Jerusalem every year to worship! It’s no wonder their minds were changed; the plague unleashed against them is hideous to behold. Their journey to Jerusalem will be a pilgrimage, coinciding with the Feast of Tabernacles, and former enemies will now be part of that annual celebration! (See Deuteronomy 16:13–15.) \n\nThink of a possible connection to the Gospels. This final appearance of the Lord on the Mount of Olives, linked with the Feast of Tabernacles, may underlie one of Peter’s irrepressible outbursts. Upon seeing Jesus transfigured before his very eyes as they were on a high mountain, he offered to make three tents (tabernacles) for Moses, Elijah, and Jesus (Matthew 17:1–4). The former two make their final Old Testament appearance at the end of Malachi, anticipating the coming Day of the Lord. Peter expressed his Messianic expectations, lodged in a fabric of biblical allusions.\n\nIt seems that what I initially dismissed as a hodgepodge of imagery in Zechariah 14, is actually spot-on. The Lord will appear! How will we possibly wrap our minds around everything that will be part of that marvelous spectacle?\n\nOne thing is certain: The Lord will be the one and only King over all the earth—even cooking pots and horse bells will testify to that truth as they will be inscribed with “holy to the Lord.” Everyone and everything will bow in allegiance. This will be a radical shift away from the culture of today. It makes me wonder how we will even handle what’s to come. \n\nIndeed, we are left with questions. That’s the way it should be when we are privy to even the smallest hints regarding the unknown future. How could we possibly tie it all up in a tidy package? Nevertheless, here’s a safe and familiar resting place: we trust in the Lord who was, and is, and is to come. He sits on the throne alongside the Lamb, and we will see His face in the new Jerusalem (Revelation 22:1–5). Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI am indescribably lucky to have the friends that I do. Describing us as “friends” seems too weak, in fact. We’ve been friends since college, and some of us since middle school and even earlier. We are in each other’s lives daily: in the good and bad, the clear and the messy, and everything in between. There are almost twenty of us, married couples and singles, brothers and sisters, roommates and travel buddies. We float in between one other’s homes, dropping our kids and our stuff here and there. We’ve swapped house keys and life stories, and we hold them both with the fiercest grip we can. \n\nI think what makes this particularly strong group of friends so secure is not that we all think the same way or like the same things. We don’t. And it’s not that we root for the same teams or go to the same churches, or laugh at the same jokes. What makes us us is our history, the steadfast faithfulness of friends that have linked arms and stood down the hardest—and celebrated the best—of what this world has to offer. \n\nWhen I read the first verses of the book of Malachi, I think about my friends and our history. (Malachi is a book of prophetic satire, written in the form of questions-and-answers between the Lord and His people.) When the Lord says, “I have loved you,” and the people scoff back, the Lord reminds them what it means to be loved by Him.\n\nBeing loved by God didn’t mean that the people always followed Him. It didn’t mean that He didn’t follow through with His promise to exile them when they turned away (see Deuteronomy 30:4–6). Being loved by God didn’t mean everything would always go right, but it did mean that He would bless them because of the promises He made to Abraham and Jacob (Romans 9:6–13). \n\nMalachi contrasts their fate with Edom’s, the group descended from Esau, who was not chosen by the Lord in the same way Israel was. Edom would be destroyed completely. Israel had felt destruction during the exile, but had been restored. \n\nThe opening disputation of Malachi (there are six that we will read this week) is a reminder, a wake up call to a lackadaisical people. They are loved, have been loved, and will be loved by the Lord. Forever.\n\nWhen we look to the grand narrative of the Bible, we see the continued faithfulness of the Lord to His people. In the Old Testament, it is to His chosen people in Israel, the sons and daughters of Jacob. In the New Testament, Jesus brings the message of hope and restoration to all people, Israelite or not. My faith finds its footing in these stories, in the reminders of the book of Malachi and in the testimonies of God’s steadfast faithfulness throughout Scripture and history. I am loved, I have been loved, and I will be loved—forever. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nWhen my daughter was first learning about sharing with other people, she used to say the funniest things. She would say, “I AM sharing. Sharing with ME.”\n\nWe’d laugh it off, and thankfully as she’s grown she has become an incredibly kind, encouraging, and giving person, willing to share with whomever is around. But when she was little, those feeble attempts at “sharing” were empty gestures. She wasn’t really sharing; she was just saying the words. \n\nIn the second disputation in Malachi, we see the Lord call out the Israelite priests for the same type of behavior. They were sacrificing, yes, but they were sacrificing blind and lame animals. Some animals were stolen, and some were sick. Not only were the priests violating the Mosaic covenant (Leviticus 22:18–25), but they dismissed the Lord’s accusations. \n\nThe Lord is righteously angry with the priests. The system of sacrifice He had established to make a way for unclean people to be clean was breaking down. The priests disregarded the law, made nonchalant offerings, and then claimed, “What a nuisance!”\n\nThe priests weren’t really sacrificing. They were going through the motions, but not experiencing the fullness of what the Lord had intended for them. They took His name and presence for granted. Contextually, it’s hard to imagine. The people of Israel had already been exiled for this exact behavior: ignoring the Lord, following other gods, not taking His name seriously. But the Lord had restored them. They were home. And yet, again, they were falling back into the same sinful patterns.\n\nThe book of Malachi is unique, a set of prophecies written after the return to Israel. But its warnings feel deeply personal to me. Am I really living in the fullness of what the Lord intended? Do I go through the motions without feeling the cost of following Him? Am I taking His goodness, presence, and mercy for granted? \n\nI love how the sharply-wielded critique of a thousands-year-old prophet can cut me down to my knees. It’s the power of Scripture, the words of the holy Lord of Armies, reminding me that He alone is God, and His name will be feared among the nations. I’m thankful for that promise, and the reminder that the center of my universe is not me and my sad attempts at sacrifice, but rather the God who made it all.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nOh, Israel. \n\nWith the book of Malachi, we’ve reached the end of the Old Testament. For 38 books prior, we’ve seen the Israelites flounder. Malachi’s sharp wit pierces the stale narrative in new ways, but it’s the same old song. The Israelites turn away from God, marry foreign women, defile the sacrifices, and get called out for it. In today’s reading, the table is turned to the Levitical priests. \n\nThere is no loyalty in the heart of Israel, no fidelity to the God who made and called His people into relationship with Him. Malachi reminds them of the covenant God made with the line of Aaron, the first high priest sons of Aaron (the first high priest), were promised in Jeremiah 33 (a reminder of God’s covenant with David) that the “Levitical priests will never fail to have a man always before me” (v.18). \n\nThat reminder came before the exile, and God restored the Levitical priests to their stations after the Israelites returned home. But, as we read yesterday, they treated their role flippantly. “You have caused many to stumble by your instruction,” the Lord said in Malachi 2:8. This contrasts with how the Lord describes the role of the priest in the verse before: “For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should desire instruction from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the Lord of Armies.” \n\nIn the whole of Israel, the Levites were ordained as a special class: the priests. Their responsibility was great, but they failed over and over again. God needed a new covenant with His people, one dependent solely on Him. A covenant that would seal His people to Him forever, no matter their fickle hearts and minds. \n\nHebrews 8:7 reminds us, “For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second one.” It wasn’t faultess, because it depended on us. \n\nIn Matthew, the next book of the Bible and also the first of the New Testament, God sends His Son to be our Great High Priest, our Savior (Matthew 3:16–17; Hebrews 9:11–15). The new covenant through Christ would secure God’s promise to His people: “I will be their God, and they will be my people” (Hebrews 8:10). \n\nReading Malachi, like reading so many other books of the Old Testament, is not meant to be a discouragement, but rather, one of deep encouragement. God’s chosen people failed and still do. His special priests failed. But God Himself will never fail, and for that we give thanks.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI love to barbecue. Two or three times a year, I make pulled pork. It takes me three days, give or take: a wet brine, a dry rub, slow smoked on the grill, and then finished in the oven. The first bites of sweet-spicy bark are heavenly, a combination of loving preparation and long-suffering. \n\nWhen pork shoulder reaches approximately 160 degrees, it enters what is known as “the stall.” The stall can last hours and can be paralyzing for the barbecuer: the temperature gauge does not change. It sits at 160-ish degrees for hours and hours. The stall is a scientifically-studied phenomenon during which the melting fat in the meat leads the moisture in the meat to evaporate, which cools the meat. Basically, the fat is rendering and the meat is slowly, steadily becoming pure, tender deliciousness. The meat is being refined and purified by the heat. \n\nThe three disputations in today’s chapter in Malachi are about this very thing: the cost of refining. The Lord promises to send a messenger who will “be like a refiner’s fire and like launderer’s bleach” (Malachi 3:2). The messenger will “purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver. Then they will present offerings to the Lord in righteousness” (v.3). The messenger is dual: it refers to John the Baptist, who will prepare the way for Jesus, the messenger of the new covenant—the one who will go through the refining fire and be the refining fire for all of us.\n\nIn Malachi, we see the calling-out of the people and priests who tried to shortcut their way through the fire, or who claimed what they had already done and been through was enough. But the sacrifices were not about the animals, and the behavior modifications were not about performing just right, and the exile wasn’t a punishment that would wipe their sin away for good.\n\nProverbs 17:3 says, “A crucible for silver, and a smelter for gold, and the Lord is the tester of hearts.” Our hearts are just as in need of refining as the hearts of the wayward priests in the book of Malachi. Sanctification, the lifelong process of being made more like Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit, is often painful like fire as it burns away our sin. \n\n“No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it” (Hebrews 12:11). This training is hard. I can count a thousand ways the Lord is burning away the dross in my life today, and there will still be a lifetime of work to do. Asking for His refining love is the most daring and terrifying thing I can pray, but it is also the safest because of His sweet and abiding love for me.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI don’t know about you, but I’ve really enjoyed the deep dive into the book of Malachi this week. I’ve not ever read Malachi before (don’t tell my Old Testament professor!), or at least not in this sort of detail, and it’s quite the surprising and enjoyable little book tucked at the very end of the minor prophets. \n\nMalachi is a series of warnings and disputations between the Lord and His people, but there is a sharpness of wit and sarcasm that makes it stand apart from the other minor prophets. It’s a fitting end to the Old Testament, an exclamation point on the prophets that have scolded the Israelites and cried out for the Messiah. Malachi does both, though with less drama and weeping than some of the others. There are surprisingly irreverent moments, about wiping the faces of the priests with animal waste (Malachi 2:3), and others more lyrically poignant, like when Malachi describes the priests covering the Lord’s altar with tears (2:13). \n\nMalachi reminds us that the world is broken, and we are broken. Even God’s chosen people, armed with God’s precious covenants and blessings, led by the chosen Levites, have failed to sow seeds of goodness, justice, righteousness, and love. As go the Israelites, so go the rest of us: bought with the blood of Christ, but still tilling in rows of brokenness and waiting for the harvest. \n\nMalachi ends with a promise, a promise whose roots stretch all the way back to Genesis and all the way forward to Revelation. Wickedness and injustice will be no more, and those who fear the Lord will go out with joy. Goodness will be restored, and reinvented in a way that we cannot imagine how good it will be. \n\nRevelation 21 is true and beautiful, and it is such a gift to read it today alongside Malachi 4. “Nothing unclean will ever enter it,” John wrote about the new Jerusalem (Revelation 21:27). \n\nThe people to whom Malachi wrote thought that maybe they were living in the new Jerusalem, the rebuilt city after the long exile. But they weren’t, and their hearts were still shaped more by themselves than by God. \n\nThe day is coming when wickedness will burn like stubble. We still cling to the same promise the Israelites did, but our hope is anchored in the body and blood of Christ. The day is coming when the sun of righteousness will rise. Until then, may we live in joyful anticipation of the assured and blessed morning. \n\n",

Those who walked the streets with Jesus, who encountered His teaching in the synagogues, who witnessed Him healing the sick and eating with sinners—they were compelled to understand who this man was. That was 2,000 years ago. And here we are, asking the same question today.\n\nEven now, sitting in my Nashville office, surrounded by modern technology and Western comforts, I can think of no more foundational question to ask. The answer frames what I believe about God. It frames what I know about myself and how I view the world around me. And, on one hand, my response as a Christian is simple: Jesus is the Son of God. But because that is true, is there not infinitely more to know?\n\nTheologian Charles Hodge said, “The gospel is so simple that small children can understand it, and it is so profound that studies by the wisest theologians will never exhaust its riches.” I believe he’s right, and I believe the same is true with the central figure of that gospel, the person of Jesus Christ. We cannot exhaust the depth of Him, but we can know Him. \n\nThe Gospel of Matthew is a great place to start. \n\nBeginning with a genealogy, Matthew lays out his account of who Jesus is: the Messiah that the Jewish people—and the world—had been waiting for. He presents Jesus as the Son of God, born of the Holy Spirit, baptized by a prophet, and tempted by the devil. He shows Jesus as teacher, healer, servant, and friend—a man who walked the earth but was not bound by it. \n\nIn telling us who Jesus is, Matthew tells the story of our salvation. \n\nIt is a story written from the foundation of the world (Matthew 25:34). In these two chapters alone, our historian Matthew references five Old Testament prophecies fulfilled in Christ’s birth (1:22; 2:5, 15, 17, 23). He is Immanuel, “God with us,” the one who “will save his people from their sins” (1:23, 21). Jesus is not just part of this story—He is the story. \n\nI hope you’ll read along with us these next four weeks as we explore Matthew’s Gospel together and discover the true answers to that all-important question. Jesus is the Son of God. He is the Savior, the Christ, the Messiah. \n\nThis is the story Matthew tells. This is Jesus.\n\n \n\n",

While waiting for the exam, I looked at the framed diploma on the wall assuring me that this doctor had gone to medical school and successfully received her degree in ophthalmology. Can you imagine if instead of an ophthalmology degree hanging on the wall, it was a degree in something like culinary arts? I don’t want an eye doctor certified in making soufflés. I want an eye doctor certified in treating eyes. \n\nWhere someone’s authority comes from matters. It matters to us today, and it mattered to those present during the events recorded in Matthew’s Gospel.\n\nEveryone in the Galilee region was asking the same question: Who is Jesus? Some asked it aloud but probably all who came in contact with Him asked it to themselves. If Jesus was a rabbi or a prophet, that would have given Him some authority, but not authority over everything. However, if Jesus was the Son of God, that would give Him full authority. That would mean that everything He did was worth watching. Everything He said worth listening to and abiding by. \n\nThis is why the identification of Jesus in Matthew 3 is so pivotal to the gospel story. Present at Jesus’ baptism were those who were skeptical of Him, such as the Pharisees, as well as some who believed, such as John the Baptist. In front of them all, the Father answered everyone’s question: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased” (Matthew 3:17). \n\nThe declaration of Jesus’ authority mattered greatly that day. Jesus was beginning His ministry. He would go on to perform miracles and heal countless numbers of people. If He was doing so by any name other than the Father’s, if His miracles were performed through anyone other than the Holy Spirit, His authority during His ministry would be undermined, as well as the work that was done on the cross.\n\nAuthority matters. \n\nLater in chapter four, Satan tempts Jesus. What was Satan’s strategy? To question Jesus’ authority. You can’t turn this rock to bread…The angels don’t really answer to you…You are not actually in control of anything here. It’s the same strategy Satan uses to tempt us. He wants us to question Jesus’ authority, to look outside of Christ for guidance. To bow down to other idols. To look to fulfillment in other things. \n\nIf Jesus is not the authority in our lives, something else will be, someone else will be. \n\nScripture says the devil left Jesus when Jesus quoted these words from the law: “Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him” (Matthew 4:10). Satan knew he stood no chance against someone who was clear about the authority in His life. He stands no chance against us, if we are clear about the authority that is ours in Christ Jesus. \n\nWho is Jesus in your life? \n\nDoes He have authority? Is He the Son of God, or, when it comes down to it, is His role more that of a rabbi’s? A good teacher, but not the be-all-end-all? How we answer this question determines what or who has authority over our life. May it be the Son of God, and may we say with boldness today, “Him only do I serve.”  \n\n",

I hope our circus tricks of dressing up, shaking hands, and passing the plate will conjure the ineffable glory of God—maybe we can lure Him to approve of us if the children’s faces are clean! We clip our fighting short as we walk into the sanctuary; we can’t bring our pettiness into a holy place.\n\nIf only my day-to-day shenanigans really could be glossed over by washing my hair and putting clean trousers on the children every Sunday. If only our knack for welcoming visitors and taking communion would do the trick and show God how truly worthy we are.\n\nA few weeks ago, I stood in the sanctuary, hemmed in by my moderately clean children and propped up by my fashion-booties. We were singing hymns to the glory of God, and in the whirl of wrangling and worshiping I realized I was holding a child instead of the papers with the sheet music. Looking down, I saw that my papers lay under the delicately beautiful foot of an elderly woman on my left. You have to understand that I was in a hurry, wanting to keep on with the worshiping and the children and the swell of holiness.\n\nI had seen in the past magicians who could grab hold of one corner of a white tablecloth and quickly sweep it off a beautifully set table without disturbing the china or the candles that lay upon it. I had the idea that I could apply this same principle to my situation.\n\nKneeling down and holding the paper tightly in my fingers, I wish I had paused to consider that the success of the service doesn’t depend on me—we are the imperfect participants in a holy circus. Our antics are always going to be a little ridiculous. We try to do what is right, but still end up failing ridiculously, even at the moments when we should be at our very best.\n\nThe problem is that no amount of hand-waving hallelujahs, or giving of holy kisses, will make us what we ought to be. My own doings do not number me with the merciful, the peacemakers, or the pure in heart. It is tempting to think that by substituting my own Sunday morning showmanship, I can actually abolish the real law. But, as He stated in His Sermon on the Mount, Christ came to establish the law, and also to fulfill it (Matthew 5:17).\n\nAnd there is the answer: He fulfills it. Not me. He is the true peacemaker, the one who suffered for righteousness, the saltiness of the salt, the true light of the world. My antics, even at their highest and most “expert” level, are still filthy rags. Jesus laid it out for us, saying, “For I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven” (v. 20).\n\nAnd hallelujah to that. Those Pharisees worked harder than anybody at getting the holy hoedown exactly right, and even those perfectionists couldn’t do it. Thanks be to God that my salvation doesn’t depend on me.\n\nEven if I am careful, I can’t retrieve my worship folder without disturbing the ankle of a very elegant and elderly woman. But at the time, I didn’t think of all this, so I just gave it a sharp yank. We were both surprised and, I think, we were probably both a little disappointed in me. But then we sighed, raised our tambourine hands, and continued to worship. Our imperfection is written on our lips and our feet. But they are the tools we have, so we keep on worshiping.\n\n",

It may very well make you blush, but I promise to keep it PG, and I promise it’s all part of a very important point.\n\nThe Bible often refers to the Church as the Bride of Christ (2 Corinthians 11:2, Ephesians 5:22-33). Our relationship with Jesus is like a marriage—but in a perfect way. He makes us beautiful, then admires us as we walk down the aisle toward Him on our wedding day (Revelation 19:6-9). Perfectly pure. Impeccably white. Kind of awesome.\n\nSo now comes that part about intimacy.\n\nLet’s say, physically speaking, there are varying levels of intimacy. Those levels might begin with any sort of public display of affection and graduate all the way to the most intimate, behind-closed-doors, one-flesh moments meant to be shared only between a husband and wife. It’s really nobody’s business, and it’s deeply personal. A husband and wife are, indeed, one flesh. The intimate covenant they share, like Christ’s covenant with us, is sacred. \n\nWhen it comes to our relationship with God, it can be the same way. There’s PDA and then there’s sacred intimacy. There are grand public gestures of skywriting and singing telegrams (praying on the street corner “to be seen by people,” as Matthew put it in 6:5). And then there is knowing the love language of God: taking time in secret to show Him the only affections you’re chasing after are His. Pursuing Him privately, closing the doors, enjoying sacred intimacy.\n\nAny relationship that only goes as deep as public displays, or mere physical intimacy without an emotional bond and commitment, is not true intimacy. This is what Jesus warns the crowds about in Matthew 6:1, “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. Otherwise, you will have no reward with your Father in heaven.”\n\nJesus doesn’t want your love to be a spectacle. He wants it to be sacred. He wants you to seek Him and His kingdom first, before everything and everyone else (Matthew 6:33). \n\nIn a marriage—in any relationship that lasts past the honeymoon phase—intimacy takes intentionality. Sometimes it takes scheduling regular dates on the calendar, even committing to block out distractions and making space for, ahem, intimacy on a regular basis. Intimacy can be enjoyed organically, only when it is supported intentionally. Jesus told us this: “But when you pray, go into your private room, shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret” (Matthew 6:6).\n\nHow are you pursuing intimacy as the Bride of Christ? Are you intentionally closing the doors, scheduling dates, and setting aside time in order for your relationship to deepen? Or are you publically kissing Him, then living as strangers at home? Is your prayer life simply a spectacle, or is it spectacularly sacred?\n\nTo know Jesus personally is to be in loving relationship with Him, one where He longs to be gracious to us because He loves us (Isaiah 30:18). The God who calls us His treasured possession is also the greatest treasure our hearts will ever know (Deuteronomy 7:6; Matthew 6:21). The intimacy and acceptance we crave is waiting for us. \n\n“Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.” \n\n– Matthew 7:7\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 8:1-34, 2 Samuel 22:16, Isaiah 53:4-5\n\nReading Matthew 8 reminds me of Sunday School. Every story—six of them in just 34 verses—is familiar, conjuring up memories of flannel boards and coloring pages from my elementary school days. Jesus heals a leper, He calms a storm, He casts out the demons into pigs … it’s like a WOW! That’s What We Call Miracles Greatest Hits compilation. If you grew up in the Church, you know these stories. \n\nWhen we know Bible stories like the back of our hand, we risk missing the miraculous. Perhaps more importantly though, we read them as just that—stories. But these stories are true. And more than true, they are promises. Each story is not just a historical event, something that Jesus did. Rather, they are glimpses of everything that Jesus will do. \n\nIn his book The Reason for God, Tim Keller writes:\n\nWe modern people think of miracles as the suspension of the natural order, but Jesus meant them to be the restoration of the natural order. The Bible tells us that God did not originally make the world to have disease, hunger, and death in it. Jesus has come to redeem where it is wrong and heal the world where it is broken. His miracles are not just proofs that he has power but also wonderful foretastes of what he is going to do with that power. Jesus’ miracles are not just a challenge to our minds, but a promise to our hearts, that the world we all want is coming.\n\nThe miracles of Matthew 8 are about people in a specific place and time. They are about a leper, a centurion and his servant, Peter’s mother-in-law, the disciples on an angry sea, and two men with demons. But each miracle is also about the Israelites who wandered and trusted the God who promised them that one day their King would come. Each miracle is about the Jews, torn away from Jerusalem, listening to Isaiah prophesy that a Messiah would come to take on their illnesses and bear their diseases. And each miracle is about us, with our mix of ancient faith and modern doubt. Each miracle proved to the Jewish people then and teaches us now that Jesus is who He says He is, that He fulfilled God’s promises, and that He will fulfill them again. \n\nI risk reading this passage purely at face value: people needed help, they asked Jesus, and He helped them, healing the dying and rescuing the scared disciples. In my own life, I am tempted to pray with the same expectation for earthly healing and immediate help. Every prayer is my own version of “calm the storm, Jesus!” But my own experience has taught me that Jesus doesn’t always work that way. Matthew is telling us that while Jesus can do all we could ever ask or imagine, He may not always answer our earthly needs in the way we think He should. Is it enough for me to know that the One who makes even the winds and sea obey Him will also makes everything new one day? (Matthew 8:27; Revelation 21:5).\n\nSo I continue to pray for miracles, yes. I pray with faithful expectation, and sometimes, with honest doubt. I live in the tension of the already and the not yet. \n\nGod has already fulfilled His promises, and we know that we can trust Him. But He has not yet fully restored His kingdom—what Keller called “the world we all want.” So we wait and pray, hope and trust. And we read these stories about Jesus, and take heart because we know they were true then, and they are just as true for us today.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 9:1-38, Numbers 19:11-21, Hosea 2:19-20\n\nI committed an embarrassing crime in my favorite pair of boots. With double-knotted laces and heels worn from hopscotch, those shoes supported me during some of my best moments, from resting on foot pedals during piano recitals to walking across the stage to accept awards for reading and attendance. They were impressive shoes for an equally impressive first grader, or so I thought.\n\nAnd then one day, I stepped off the school bus and sat at the kitchen table to begin my homework. From here, the details get a little foggy. All I know is that a light-hearted family conversation escalated to a hearty quarrel when I stood up, angrily seeking my next victim. Without my brain’s permission, my foot swung backward to gain momentum and forward to meet a target. I kicked a hole in my parents’ couch—not a small one, either.\n\nWhile my parents were certainly less than pleased, they soon realized this deed came with a built-in punishment. After the couch had to be moved down the stairs, out the door, and across town to be repaired, I would have to explain to any guests why we temporarily had no place for them to sit.\n\n“Oh, the couch? I broke it.”\n\nWhen I remember this story, I sometimes wonder if we’re all walking around with our own versions of kicked-in couches, whatever they may be, always aware of our brokenness.\n\nMy family? We’re struggling.\n\nMy job? It’s difficult.\n\nMy body? It’s hurting.\n\nMy heart? It’s suffering.\n\nMy circumstances? They’re unfair. \n\nIn Matthew 9, we find person after person in physical suffering, and yet, Jesus’ response to each one is very similar.\n\n“Have courage, your sins are forgiven” (v. 2).\n\n“Get up and walk” (v. 6).\n\n“Have courage, your faith has saved you” (v. 22).\n\n“Let it be done according to your faith” (v. 29). \n\nHere, Jesus isn’t telling us to brush ourselves off from the hurt; He is showing us what it means to be whole again. It’s more than the healing of our bodies, our families, or any other shattered piece we may be holding. True healing can only be found through forgiveness, and ultimately, through Jesus’ broken body and shed blood. He knew that “it is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are sick… For [He] didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners (Matthew 9:12-13).\n\nJesus calls out a truth that maybe we’re too afraid or wrapped up in our circumstances to admit: Broken lives require faith. We may not know what to do with broken pieces and messy circumstances, but He certainly knows what to do with the bold faith of His children. Jesus uses the broken pieces to draw us to His wholeness.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 10:1-42, Acts 1:13, James 2:1-7 \n\nHave you ever received a gift with no strings attached? Many of us may recall the joy of receiving Christmas presents as a child. When you’re young there are no expectations of repayment; the gift is freely given, and certainly, freely taken. \n\nDo you also know what it’s like to receive a gift with strings attached? Maybe you “won” a free night at the hotel in exchange for a timeshare meeting, or your friend loaned you their car with an unspoken debt to pay. It’s not so fun to receive a gift and find out later it wasn’t really free.  \n\nThe gift of salvation can only be received freely like a child. “Life to the fullest” is free to us because our generous God paid the price with His own Son (John 10:10). Not to mention, we couldn’t pay the fair value for such a precious present, even if we tried. “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).\n\nWhen Jesus sent out His twelve disciples for the first time, He warned them about the quid-pro-quo economy of the world (Matthew 10). Jesus was well aware that when you start healing people, driving out demons, or raising people from the dead, there will be loved ones willing and eager to compensate you. \n\nBut Jesus does not want people to believe they can buy God’s love or favor. The Lord doesn’t want you to confuse the gospel with a bait-and-switch timeshare meeting. Christ warned the disciples against the temptation to take those payments. He reminded them that they had received spiritual gifts without paying for them, so they should not charge others. “Freely you received, freely give,” He instructed them (Matthew 10:8).\n\nWe might not expect our neighbor or coworker to pay us money for our encouragement or service, but do we secretly expect them to pay us back with social favors or reciprocated acts? Are there spiritual gifts the Lord has given you that He wants you to spill out onto others lavishly? If you’ve been given the spiritual gift of encouragement, encourage others in the faith freely. If God has given you the spiritual gift of service, serve with a heart of generosity. \n\nEverything we have has been given to us. When we remember that our salvation, financial resources, and spiritual gifts are purely by the grace of God, we become stewards instead of hoarders. As followers of Christ sent into the world, we are given the same instructions as the twelve disciples. Give away the most valuable gift of God’s love at no charge, because that is how we all received it—freely.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 11:1-30, Isaiah 29:18-19, 1 John 5:3-4\n\nIt’s one of those moments so deeply seared onto my heart that I still glance at the memories and wince. I was in a Jamaican infirmary, tasked with offering some measure of comfort to the sick and dying housed there. Their beds were jammed together, packing every room. Conditions weren’t sanitary. Many patients wailed incessantly. My comfort-craving brain wanted to find the escape hatch, to look somewhere other than at the faces of these people I could do so little for. Maybe that’s why my eyes kept drifting out the windows at the sugary white sand and emerald blue Caribbean waters that sparkled just beyond the compound’s walls.\n\nThe juxtaposition of human sorrow and breathtaking beauty sticks with me still. Jesus was on the shore and in the suffering at the same time. We find a juxtaposition just as jarring in Matthew 11. \n\nJohn the Baptist was imprisoned for his faith, sitting on death row. Yet, Jesus was using John’s predicament as an object lesson for true discipleship when He delivered these comforting words:\n\n“Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls, For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (vv. 28-30). \n\nRest. Our bleary eyes and exhausted souls crave it, don’t they? And yet, John would remain in prison until his gruesome death. Humanly speaking, John’s yoke was not easy. His burden was not light. So, what did Jesus mean? \n\nI imagine John must have looked around his prison cell and felt tired from the weight of it all. He sent messengers to make sure Jesus had something better to offer (vv. 1-3). Our weary hearts often wonder the same thing, don’t they?\n\nJesus responds like this:\n\n“Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them” (vv. 4-5). \n\nRest from pain, suffering, and worry is certainly something we can all readily give our “Amen!” to. But then here comes that juxtaposition again—that same tension—when Jesus adds, “And blessed be the one who is not offended by me” (v. 6). \n\nWhen this world leaves me weary, I want to take a nap. But Jesus wants to give me a break from the tyranny of self. If the kind of rest Christ offers doesn’t look like I think it will, He must be promising so much more. \n\nIf a good night’s sleep and an easy life was all Jesus had to give John, it would not have been enough to keep him chained to Christ. John would die for his faith—not for a handful of miracles that had already happened, but for a tsunami of healing that was to come. Somewhere along the way, John must’ve resolved that the rest he needed most was not circumstantial. \n\nWe are all broken by sin, longing for a cure. Jesus walks among us, removing the yoke of sin that bends our backs and breaks our hearts. Suffering and sleeplessness may remain temporarily, but the burden of sin is no longer ours to carry. Jesus took that burden so we could know the kind of rest that seeps past our bones and into our weary souls.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 12:1-50, Leviticus 19:9-10, Isaiah 42:1-4\n\nRecently, at a dinner with friends, I noticed the person sitting next to me skip the pork tenderloin and serve himself an extra spoonful of brussels sprouts. This made no sense to me.\n\n“Are you a vegetarian?” I asked, hoping to avoid a pitch to join the fold. (I love meat.) \n\n“Oh no,” he said. “I’m just taking a break. We went paleo for a long time and I kind of went overboard.”\n\nI laughed. Sure enough, a few years ago my husband and I decided to go Paleo too. This was before the “Whole 30” eating plan was a thing. We were simply trying to do something different with our diet, and quickly learned how easy it was to make a meal out of veggies and protein. But it was also easy to use the “Paleo” rules to fill our plates with nothing but pork, bacon, and ground beef.\n\nIt’s easy to follow the rules but ignore the spirit and intent behind them.\n\nThat’s the heart of Matthew 12. At this time in history, Pharisees were a group of devout Jewish men who had tried to keep every letter of the law. Scribes, mentioned later in the passage, were essentially lawyers—men who copied and interpreted the law of Moses for the people. Both groups knew the rules inside and out. And sure enough, they were right about the rules.\n\nIn the book of Leviticus, the Lord instructs His people not to strip the farmland bare, but to leave the final portion to the poor and to immigrants. In fact, in the book of Ruth, we see Ruth, a poor, barren immigrant woman, benefitting from that compassionate law, as she gathers grain from Boaz’s field. But intent on proving Jesus to be a hypocrite, the Pharisees point out that He was breaking two laws: the harvesting laws and the laws prohibiting work on the Sabbath.\n\nI can almost see their self-satisfied smiles as they imagine Jesus stuttering to respond. But He doesn’t miss a beat. He says He is Lord of the Sabbath because He created it (vv. 6-8). He defined rest.\n\nAnd yet, the Pharisees continue to press. Entering the temple, they point to a crippled man and ask Jesus a theoretical question, as if they can stump Him with a bit of moral philosophy. In order to accuse Him, they asked, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?” (v. 9).\n\nAre you kidding me? How prideful! How arrogant! As if they wanted to go around healing crippled people, but the Sabbath was all that was stopping them? If I were Jesus, I would have yelled, “You Pharisees couldn’t heal whether it was on the Sabbath or not! Shut your traps!”\n\nBut thankfully, Jesus is not me.\n\nHe doesn’t answer them while screaming and shouting like I would have. Instead, He exposes their hearts with a simple story that even a child could understand, making the truth abundantly clear: There is no prohibition against mercy. Only He can heal, and only He determines when to do it.\n\nScribes and Pharisees dole out burdens and rules and loopholes and philosophical arguments. Jesus delivers hope. May we put our trust in His name alone.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Jesus Speaks in Parables",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 13:1-52, 1 Corinthians 5:6-7\n\nUntil last year, I had never seen the movie Star Wars. This was the cinematic equivalent of blasphemy for my in-laws, my friends—pretty much everyone else in the world, really. Star Wars is part of our cultural lexicon, but when you’ve never seen it, most references to it go unnoticed. It’s as if fans of the film franchise speak another language when they talk about it. Sure, I was familiar with the line, “Luke, I am your father,” but anything more than that, and I was totally lost. I’d heard about Star Wars a lot, but I’d never understood the context of what I was hearing. And I certainly couldn’t contribute to the conversation. \n\nWhen Jesus taught in parables, He was speaking to two audiences. Some, like His disciples, understood what He was teaching. And if they didn’t understand, they would ask Jesus to explain. Others belonged to the “you will hear but never understand” camp (Matthew 13:14). Much like being a part of a conversation about a movie you’ve never seen or a book you’ve never read, the latter audience could tune out Jesus’ message. \n\nJesus knew that by speaking in parables, His message would get through to the right people—the people who would open their hearts to Him and who would work to see the kingdom of God flourish. He also knew that the people who were out to get Him (the Pharisees, the Romans) would not understand the parables, and so to some degree, parables were a protective measure. \n\nReading the parable of the sower, I wonder where I land on the spectrum of listeners. As Jesus sows the seeds of His message, how receptive are my heart and mind? Do I have a hard heart and closed eyes when I read Scripture? Do I read the difficult parts with the same rigor and delight as I do the easier passages? Do I cling to the Jesus who heals and pardons, and shy away from the Jesus who turns over tables and calls out sinners? Do I let the double-edged sword of Scripture do its good, sanctifying work in me? \n\nEugene Peterson wrote it this way in The Message: “They stick their fingers in their ears so they won’t have to listen; They screw their eyes shut so they won’t have to look, so they won’t have to deal with me face-to-face and let me heal them” (Matthew 13:15).\n\nI know my heart is rocky and full of weeds that choke out the Word. The parable of the sower exposes my idols, holding them up to the light of Jesus’ message about the kingdom of God, about the freedom and peace He, and He alone, brings. But I am tempted to fall away when trials come, turning to my own strength instead of the Word of God. I chase the material, the next-best, and the greener grass, instead of running relentlessly after Jesus alone. My faith is weak, even when I long for it to somehow be enough. \n\nThe remedy for my fallow heart is the Word. \n\nThe Apostle Paul tells us that “faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ” (Romans 10:17). May it be so with us. May we be eager listeners with hearts rich with fertile ground, anxious know His teaching, and ready to whatever He asks of us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 13:53-58, Matthew 14:1-36, Deuteronomy 8:3, Isaiah 43:10-13\n\n“Have courage! It is I.”\n\nWhen we read these words in Matthew 14:27, from the viewpoint of our modern context, it’s easy to miss their significance. It’s easy to dismiss them as a much needed encouragement, and little more. The disciples, after all, are frightened. They are stranded in a boat, far from shore, their vessel “buffeted by the waves.” Jesus “goes out to them,” walking across the water, which only stokes their fears more (vv.24-25).\n\nTo calm their anxieties, Jesus says, “It is I,” clarifying who He is. And immediately, Peter recognizes his teacher. \n\nThe climax of the story would seem to come later, when Peter joins Jesus in the waves. But the truth is, this verse is a bombshell. Jesus is making a statement of cosmic proportions, so it’s important not to miss what is happening. \n\nIn these five short words, Jesus is not merely identifying Himself, not in the usual way. This statement is not like announcing yourself at your parents’ back door: “It’s me! Just popping by!” Instead Jesus is making a monumental claim, one that Matthew’s Jewish listeners certainly would have noticed. Jesus is not just identifying Himself as the man they know and love. He is identifying Himself as God.\n\n“It is I”—translated from the Greek words ego eimi, which literally means “I am”—is a clear reference to an Old Testament story. Thousands of years earlier, God identified Himself to Moses in exactly the same way (Exodus 3:14). Theologian Stanley Hauerwas explains, “Just as God names himself to Moses in the burning bush, Jesus identifies himself as ‘I am.’ This is the ‘I am’ of Psalm 77:19, the ‘I am” who provides a way through the sea, a path though the mighty waters.”  \n\nIn other words, Jesus isn’t simply identifying Himself in the midst of the storm; He is identifying His place in human history. Jesus is not just another prophet. He is not just another priest. He is not just another rescuer. He is not just another king. Jesus is no ordinary “good person” who loves God and happens to know a lot about Scripture. Jesus is God Himself, the God who delivered the Israelites and parted the Red Sea. He is the God who is more than able to command the threatening waves below Him.\n\nIt’s an audacious claim, blasphemous even, had it not been true. And it’s a claim that continues to assert its power over our storms today, promising that Jesus is not simply with us, but as God of the universe He is reigning over all creation. We are guaranteed both the intimate presence of the Son, and the almighty authority of the Father. \n\nBoth then and now, we have this comfort and this truth. Jesus is not just our teacher, not just a good example, and not just a friend. Instead He declares, “It is I”:\n\nI am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I am the God of Moses—the God who heard my people cry, and delivered them. I am the God who sees, who knows, and who cares. I am capable and faithful, steady and good. I am not the God who was, or the God who will be; I am the God who is—unchanging, unshakeable, unfailingly compassionate and near.\n\nAnd I, Jesus, have another name: I AM.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 15:1-39, Matthew 16:1-28, Zechariah 12:10, 2 Peter 1:16-18\n\nI am very good at proclaiming things:\n\nI’m going to run a marathon!\n\nI’m going to take music lessons!\n\nI’m going to write one poem a day!\n\nBut these are things that are easier said than done; therefore, I say them, but do not really do them. I ran a half marathon, not a full. I took voice lessons for a few weeks, then quit. I wrote about six poems—over the course of an entire year.\n\nDeclarations are good, but in order to follow through with them we must understand their implications. \n\nIn Matthew 16, Jesus asks His followers, “Who do you say that I am?” And Peter has the right answer: “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God!” he declares (vv. 15-16). \n\nBut just a few verses later, we see that Peter doesn’t fully understand the implications of his declaration. When Jesus explains to His disciples what will eventually happen to Him in Jerusalem, that He will suffer on the cross, Peter is upset. “Oh no, Lord!” he says, “This will never happen to you!” (v. 22). \n\nAs my IVP Bible Background Commentary notes, “Peter had divulged Jesus’ secret identity yet had retained a faulty concept of what that identity entailed.” In other words, it’s one thing to say Jesus is the Messiah; it’s another to understand the implications this has on our lives. \n\nJesus proceeds to very clearly explain what it means to believe He is the Messiah, saying, “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me” (v. 24). Three things: deny yourself, take up your cross, follow Jesus. For those of you who’ve been on this Christian journey for a while, you might be thinking what I’m thinking: Easier said than done. \n\nAll three of these commands are incredibly counterintuitive to our sin nature. “Deny yourself” implies denying your selfish desires, ambitions, and needs. “Take up your cross” implies being prepared for the ridicule and scorn of others, even being prepared for death itself. “Follow me” implies allowing Jesus to be Lord of your life, laying down your control, and giving it to Him. \n\nI can declare that Jesus is the Messiah all day long, but do my actions reflect that I truly believe this? Have I denied myself today? Am I more concerned with what others think than I am with openly being a Christ follower? Am I allowing Jesus to control my life, or am I still gripping the wheel?\n\nBacking up a little in this passage we see that Jesus first asked His disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” (v. 13). He wanted to know what the disciples had observed others were saying about Him. Then He asks, “But you… who do you say that I am?” (v. 15). To me, it feels like the emphasis is on that second question. Jesus is more concerned with who His followers believe Him to be than what other men are saying about Him. \n\nWho we, as Christ followers, proclaim Jesus to be is critical for the world that is looking on. And how we act—much more than what we say—reflects whether or not we believe Jesus is the Messiah. \n\nWe can say and not do, proclaiming Jesus is the Messiah but never denying ourselves, never actually following Him. Or, through the power of Christ in us, we can proclaim and do, showing those around us who Jesus is. Pointing them to Him with our lives. Pointing them to the true Messiah.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 17:1-27, Matthew 18:1-35, 1 Kings 8:10-13, Jeremiah 23:1-4\n\n“Lord,” he said, “have mercy.”\n\nThis was the plea of a father made on behalf of his demon-possessed son. It is a request we have all cried out at one time or another, in different languages and circumstances. In big and small ways, we are constantly asking for mercy from the Lord and from each other. \n\nGive us more time!\n\nHelp us find her!\n\nDon’t lay me down for a nap!\n\n(And as the years pass…) Please, just let me rest!\n\nWhen Jesus healed the demon-possessed boy, His disciples gathered around to understand why they’d been unable to work the miracle themselves. \n\n“Because of your little faith,” he told them. “For truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed… nothing will be impossible for you” (Matthew 17:20).\n\nThe disciples were unable to give this man and his son the mercy they needed because their own faith was so small. While the disciples couldn’t heal the boy or cast out the demon, Jesus could. In fact, earlier in this chapter, the mere radiance of His glory sent them falling to the ground in terror (v. 5). Indeed, Jesus is set apart by His glory.\n\nAlthough there are certainly other times in Scripture when the disciples were able to perform miracles, this case is especially interesting because the man specifically asked for mercy, and the disciples were unable to give it. Later, in chapter 18, Jesus shared the parable of a servant who owes his master a huge sum—a sum so huge that he would need several lifetimes to pay it back. But then that servant turns around and finds somebody who owes him a couple of nickels, and starts choking him to give back his money (vv. 23-28).\n\nAlthough we don’t literally put our hands around the throats of those who owe us something, we do choke others with our lack of mercy and forgiveness. There is a great chasm of difference between God’s mercy and ours, between God’s faithfulness and our faithlessness, between God’s glory and our need. Jesus’ parable forces me to look at the truth: Even when I actually want to be merciful and forgiving, in my own strength, my best efforts prove my ability to forgive is forever lacking.\n\nThe vastness of God’s never-ending mercy shows us our need for forgiveness is enormous. Grasping that need is the first step to understanding the gospel. \n\nIt’s difficult to remember mercy when someone hurts us. Some of us have been hurt so badly it feels like everything is ruined, that nothing can restore what’s been taken from us. The very thought of the offense can fill us with fear and loathing. But we do well to remember this: In order to forgive us, Christ had to die for us. He took the curse that we brought to Him and gave up everything, so He could give us mercy (Galatians 3:13). This is staggering.\n\nTrue forgiveness costs everything. But God loves us so much, He freely gave everything. While this passage does remind us that we are like the unforgiving slave, the bigger truth here is that God is our compassionate Master, and He piles love and forgiveness on us all.\n\nThe gospel is true! God’s great love and mercy for us are greater than all our sins.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 19:1-30, Matthew 20:1-34, Deuteronomy 6:4, 2 Peter 3:10-13\n\nI am very hopeful that my one-day husband’s last name will begin with a letter in the first half of the alphabet. You see, while I love my last name with my whole heart, it begins with a “W,” which means the line for almost anything ends with me.\n\nDuring college graduation, I imagine that my friends whose last names fall at the beginning of the alphabet —Austin, Brock, and Chapman—were all halfway through their family celebration dinners before it was my turn to walk across the stage. I have very big ideas about what it would mean to be first in line.\n\nGetting ahead is the name of the human game. We want nothing more than to be picked first for the kickball team, secure the best seats at the movie theater, win the affection of our coworkers, achieve financial success, and ensure our security and worth at every turn.\n\nSo in Matthew 19, when Jesus says, “Many who are first will be last, and the last first” (v. 30), it may be our first instinct to picture a world where the underdog wins the game of getting ahead—the least athletic kid gets picked first for kickball, and those without savings accounts win the lottery. This is the illustration Jesus gives us, but its main purpose is to point to something even greater: His own measure of success.\n\nGod’s goal isn’t helping us to get ahead—it’s helping us get to Him. His redemption does not work within the constraints of the world’s standards, but within the bounds of eternity.\n\nIn the parable of the vineyard workers in Matthew 20, the workers hired at the beginning of the day are angry by the end of it. They are complaining because the other workers—hired hands just as they were—had done nothing, yet had been made equal to them. None of the workers were underpaid or overworked. Some of them had just experienced “undeserved” kindness, leaving others to feel less superior.\n\nAt least, that’s how it looks from our perspective. But these aren’t just rules and concepts Jesus wants us to unlearn from the ways of the world. Christ is showing us that His kingdom is wholly better. In it, we will be fully loved by Him, forever united. This is the message that all of Jesus’ teachings in these passages point to: unity over divorce, children inheriting the kingdom, poor over rich, last before first. Jesus came to serve the undeserving with kindness; this is the heart of God’s economy.\n\nAs Tim Keller says, “The gospel is this: We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than we ever dared to believe, yet at the very same time we are more loved and accepted in Jesus Christ than we ever dared hope.”\n\nKnowing all our earthly measures are off, let us look to Him, for we are worse and He is better than we could ever guess. May our deepest goal and desire be to find ourselves not first or last, but close to Him. Amen.\n\n",

The hosanna-shouters must have been shocked to see the man on the donkey driving the sellers out of the temple with such authority. “My house will be called a house of prayer,” Jesus said to them. “But you are making it a den of thieves!” (Matthew 21:13).\n\nBut it’s what He did next that was truly radical: He invited the least inside. \n\nThe blind, the lame, the children all came in and Jesus welcomed them, healed them, confirmed their place among Him (vv. 14-15). He cleared out those who had profaned the temple and ushered in those who humbly sought after God. \n\nWhen I picture the scene I can see myself in the wings, on the outside looking in. I am nervous, I am afraid, but I am drawn to this house of God, and so I watch and wait. Those inside seem to have it together, bringing riches rather than sacrifice, doing religion like a business. All I have is this humble offering in my hands, carried the long journey from my home, over rocky roads and mistake-laden miles. \n\nThen I see Him. And right before my eyes I watch Him turn it on its side, all the pretension and injustice and darkness that kept me at bay. He sends out those who’ve come not for God but for gods. \n\nAnd then? He looks me in the eye. Me. Lame, frightened, filthy from days of travel. He looks at me and sees me. He motions for me to come in and then He tells me I belong. \n\nI had cried out “Hosanna! Save me!” not knowing what I was really asking. And He rode on through the streets and into the city, knowing exactly what was coming. He would soon die, but not before He cleansed His house of prayer and invited me in. \n\nThis is our Christ! “The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone” (v. 42). He welcomes in the defenseless, becoming their defense. He brings the weak to Himself and makes them strong. He desires not the shiny sacrifices our pride wishes to bring, but only a heart that is stayed on Him. He saves us when we call out to Him.\n\nOnly He knows what our hearts truly need as we cry out, “Hosanna!” He knew it even then.\n\n \n\n",

Just the other day, I woke to the sound of my phone’s beeping alarm. Ugh. That was my first response. But as my feet hit the ground, something seemed off. Oh, that’s right. It’s Saturday, isn’t it?\n\nIt’s sad but true: I’ve been known to get so caught up in the daily grind that I’ve forgotten about the glory and goodness of the coming weekend. \n\nThe Sadducees didn’t just forget about the good news; they completely denied the possibility of life after death. Anyone remember singing at Vacation Bible School, “I don’t want to be a Sadducee, because they’re so sad you see”? Well, the reason they were “sad” is because their sect of Judaism had no hope for bodily resurrection. The Sadducees wanted to make the idea of the resurrection look ridiculous, and Matthew 22 recounts their attempt to trap the Messiah with a trick question.  \n\nHow did Jesus respond to their attempts at trickery? He lovingly responded to them in their own language, and then offered them a challenge. Because the Sadducees esteemed Moses over all others, Jesus quoted what Moses had to say about the resurrection. When God appeared to Moses in the burning bush, He said, “I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob” (Exodus 3:6). The Lord used the present tense—“I am,” not “I was.” \n\n“He is not the God of the dead, but of the living” (Matthew 22:32). Jesus confirms that Abraham is living, Isaac is living, Jacob is living. There is life after death. Hallelujah!\n\nIt’s easy for us to judge the Sadducees’ unbelief because we have the full and complete gospel in mind. We know that Jesus went down to the grave and rose again. Still, while we might not outright deny the resurrection, do we sometimes forget about it? It’s easy to get so focused on our everyday lives that we lose sight of our heavenly future. We live in fear, cling to earthly security, and fight for status. We may not deny the resurrection with our tongues, but we do with our thoughts and actions. \n\nChrist’s response to the Sadducees is a response for all of us. The Lord understands where you’re coming from and wants to lovingly speak to you about what’s to come. He knows exactly what makes you forget the eternal hope—whether you’re struggling with anxiety, exhausted by caring for children, distracted by work, or any number of other things. He gets it, but He doesn’t leave us there. He gives us true hope. \n\nJesus also challenged the Sadducees to know Scripture better. Could the same be said for us? When we lose sight of the good news, let’s fill our minds with the truth of God’s Word and open our ears to the Lord who speaks to us. May we delve into our Bibles for wisdom from above and hold fast to the living hope of the resurrection.\n\n“Because of his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you.”\n\n– 1 Peter 1:3-4\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 23:1-39, Exodus 10:21-23, Romans 8:22-23\n\nToday’s passage is a doozy. In Matthew 23, Jesus holds nothing back, saving His harshest, sternest rebuke for two groups. \n\nFirst were the prideful Pharisees, who piled unnecessary burden onto the people. Rather than seeing God’s law as His love, the Pharisees used it as a weapon of position and power. Second were the sidelined scribes. They knew the law, but refused to speak up against the Pharisees’ hypocrisy, and therefore, became a part of the problem themselves. Fearful of the Pharisees’ power, the scribes kept silent, allowing the Pharisees’ perverted message to flourish. They could’ve been a voice for truth, but instead stood by and allowed the Pharisees to abuse the people.  \n\nJesus strongly condemned the Pharisees and scribes—but why?\n\nJesus saw their passion for position. The Pharisees were obsessed with increasing their own authority. They cared a lot about titles, requiring people to call them “Teacher,” “Master,” or “Father,” and racked up converts—not for the benefit of others’ souls, but for the sake of showing the power of their sect. They exalted themselves with false humility, and Jesus saw right through it. \n\nThe Pharisees perverted the Lord’s priorities. They were strict and precise when it came to small matters within the law, while being careless and loose about the things that mattered most. They pointed out small flaws in others while ignoring pervasive sin in their own hearts.\n\nJesus condemned the powerlessness of the Pharisees’ prescriptions. In their position of influence, Pharisees and scribes could have pointed people to deeper relationship with the Lord. Instead, they paved a road that led to destruction.\n\nThe Pharisees were preoccupied with perception. They cared deeply about what other people thought of them, wanting to be followed, trusted, honored, and revered. More concerned with their outward appearance than substance, they dressed to impress. In Deuteronomy, the Lord told His people to impress His commandments on their hearts, to “tie them on your hands and bind them on your foreheads” (6:8). Jews took that literally. During times of prayer, they tied small leather boxes called phylacteries onto their foreheads with Scripture verses hidden inside. The Pharisees made their phylacteries as large as possible, as if to say, “Look at how much Scripture I can carry on my forehead! More than you!”  \n\nBut does it really matter how beautiful you look on the outside, if you’re dying on the inside? Does it matter how beautiful the stone is, when all it marks is a grave?\n\nThe Pharisees were persistent in pride. They allowed themselves to carry on in the sin of their day, while still convinced they would’ve opposed the sins of their fathers. Jesus exposes their hypocrisy and self-deception under the microscope of truth. But the rebukes we hear in Matthew 23 aren’t angry rants—they are woes. Jesus feels deep anguish for the Pharisees and scribes, and for the people they are leading astray, to death. He isn’t smug. He’s not pointing fingers. He’s begging them to see the light. \n\nI imagine Jesus’ heart tearing in two as He speaks to them, longing for them to hear and receive the truth. He knows these are the very men whose hardened hearts will soon cry out, “Crucify!” These men and their pride, their empty passions—they will soon lead Jesus to the cross. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 24:1-51, Matthew 25:1-46, Daniel 7:13-14\n\nRather than organizing our lives into a zillion little categories like family and finances, work and leisure, God’s Word invites us to adopt a new filing system. Everything ultimately fits into one of only two categories: former things, which are destined to pass away, and forever things, which never will. There is no third option. \n\nIn language that feels equal parts inspiring and terrifying, Jesus reminds us to consider forever things here in Matthew 24 and 25. While the gravitational pull of our hearts is to spend our time thinking about the days on our calendar, Christ reminds us that a Day is coming soon that will forever sever our ties to the temporary.\n\n“Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with aloud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one of heaven to the other” (Matthew 24:30-31). \n\nWhen Christ returns a second time, the former things will be no more, and only forever things will remain. It’s a promise so spectacular our hearts can’t seem to absorb it. Jesus knows our tendency is to drop our eyes toward our navels rather than straining them heavenward, waiting for His return. In a parable designed to teach us how to wait well, He compares the Church to ten virgins waiting for their bridegroom. Five came prepared to wait as long as necessary. Five were foolish and did not (Matthew 25:1-12).\n\nJust like Jesus’ disciples who slept instead of standing guard with Him in the garden the night before He died, we are the sleepy virgins, prone to to become weary and distracted as we wait. But our Groom is coming. He’s already on His way. There’s still time to shift our focus away from bills and brokenness and toward our coming King. And while we do not know either the day or the hour, we do know that He’s called us to be alert and ready, waiting for Him with expectant hope of His return (v. 13). \n\nIn Revelation 21 we’re given a glimpse of what life will be like after Jesus rides in on the clouds. Jesus says, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God” (v. 3). Christ is coming back to save the Bride whose ransom He’s already paid. Our long separation from Him will finally come to an end. What then?\n\n“He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away” (v. 4, emphasis mine). Death, mourning, crying, pain—these will all become former things. As Christ teaches about His return, we find that it’s not that temporal things don’t matter, but a time is coming when they won’t. Jesus is coming back for us. On the timeline of eternity, it won’t be long now. May He find us waiting well.\n\n",

In this chapter of Matthew 26, we follow Christ through His final days and hours and watch, blow by agonizing blow, how He gives His life away in little pieces, even before He gasps His last breath on Golgotha. Judas plays his role, but Christ handed Himself over.\n\nWhat did it look like for Christ to give His life, while He still breathed, as He willingly walked to His death? He gives it away in so many big and small ways in this chapter alone, that I don’t have space here to touch on each. (If you can, take time to circle all the ways you see Christ giving away His life in these verses.) But we can look at a few here together.\n\nWithin the first two verses of the chapter, Jesus tells His disciples the exact day He will die. He specifies that it will happen in two days’ time. We don’t have a record here of their response, but judging from their other responses in Scripture, disbelief is a fair guess. Jesus gives His life by declaring His intention to do so.\n\nHe then allows the woman to prepare His body for burial. He defends her extravagance and celebrates her for seeing a small part of the truth of what would happen to Him, declaring her actions as noble (vv. 6-13). He knows what is coming, yet He doesn’t run from it. Jesus gives His life by preparing for His own burial.\n\nWhile He shares His final meal with the disciples, Jesus distresses His disciples by saying, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me” (v. 21). He suffers one of the deepest human sorrows: betrayal by a friend. In spite of their protestations, His disciples continue to betray Him as they fall asleep (vv. 36-46), desert Him (v. 56), and deny Him (vv. 69-75). Jesus gives His life by suffering betrayal.\n\nIn all these little ways and more, Jesus gave up His life for us. He suffered the whole gamut of human pain from heartbreak to torture. Reading all of this horror would feel gratuitous, except this is the narrative of our own happy ending. Because of Jesus’ thousand tiny deaths, and one literal death, we can live. We not only live, but we get to live happily ever after, with Him. This harrowing history is the key. He slayed the dragon of death and sin, and we can live in grateful joy for His precious sacrifice.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 27:1-66, Matthew 28:1-20, Psalm 22:7-8, 1 Corinthians 15:6, 2 Corinthians 3:18\n\nMy parents like to tell this story about me as a three-year-old.\n\nMy sister and I had a babysitter for the night, and my mom had made us brownies to have as a snack, with the instruction that we were each allowed one brownie. After the first brownie, I reached for a second. \n\n“No, Andrea,” said the babysitter. “You can only have one.” I looked at her, and with a scrunched up face and my hands on my hips, I declared, “You’re not the boss!” At the time, I had a speech impediment that softened my “R”s. So you can imagine how intimidating this sounded to my babysitter.\n\nI still have authority issues. Authority threatens my freedom. It says I am not in charge, not the boss of my own life. Yet, as Christians, we aren’t meant to live under the authority of our own rule. We have a King!\n\nThe Kingship of Jesus is highlighted in Matthew’s account of the crucifixion and resurrection. It was a Roman custom to name the crime of the offender on a plaque and place it above the criminal’s head as He hung on the cross. Because Pilate said Jesus had committed no real crime, he ordered this inscription instead:\n\n“This is Jesus, the King of the Jews” (Matthew 27:37).\n\nIt was a label given in contempt that could not have been more correct. \n\nScripture tells us Jesus is not only King of the Jews, but He is the King. As Revelation 19:16 says, “he has a name written on his robe on his thigh: King of Kings and LORD of Lords.” Still, I more often refer to Jesus as my Savior rather than my King. Charles Spurgeon says this is our tendency: “Men might be willing for Christ to save them, but not for Him to reign over them.”\n\nAcknowledging that Jesus reigns over me means acknowledging that I am not in control. But His kingship also means He is involved in the everyday—that His sovereignty covers even the nitty gritty of life. There is accountability that says we are called to a new, gospel way of living, and there is grace that says we aren’t doing this on our own. Both threaten our autonomy. \n\nSo we have to ask ourselves: Who’s the boss here? Me or Jesus?\n\nWhen we bow to Jesus as our King, we receive what we are most afraid of losing in the face of authority: freedom. Real freedom. \n\n“So if the Son sets you free, you really will be free” (John 8:36). \n\nThat’s the type of freedom I want. Not the kind that creates the illusion of my own control, but the kind that comes with the cross. The kind that comes with surrendering to the power that conquered death forever and rose victorious from the grave. \n\nThis is Jesus. He is the Son of God, the King of the Jews, the Savior of the world—and He is also the King of me. \n\nThe angel told the women, “Don’t be afraid, because I know you are looking for Jesus who was crucified. He is not here. For he has risen, just as he said.”\n\nMatthew 28:5-6\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Mark 1, Nahum 1:15, Malachi 3:1\n\nI sometimes study best with a pen in hand. \n\nThere’s probably some scientific reason to explain the powerful connection between our hands and head as they interact with the same thing—or maybe I just made that up. Either way, it totally works for me. When I really want to learn something, I use a pen to help me make a visual map of the text I’m reading. The book of Mark calls for pen-in-hand reading; there’s a lot going on and it all happens very quickly.\n\nThe apostle Luke spends the first two chapters of his Gospel beautifully telling the story of the expectation and arrival of the baby Jesus. Matthew walks us through one long (and super important!) genealogy of Christ before any real narrative begins. And John takes time to establish Jesus as the Word who was with God and is God. All wonderful stuff, critical to the canon.\n\nMark, on the other hand, hits the ground running. And really, he never stops. Heavy on directional language and light on details, the first chapter alone includes at least ten significant plot points, all connected with words like “immediately” and “right away,” as we whiplash into yet another important scene. (You know I marked every one of them with my trusty pen. Pun intended.)\n\nNow, I’m not accusing Mark of writing like he’s running out of time, but there is an efficiency to his message that tells me there’s no time to spare. The gospel is urgent, and there is much Mark wants his readers to know about the Christ he loves and follows.\n\nStill, amid the rapid-fire storyline of the first chapter of Mark, the moments of stillness have a way of standing out. (And yes, I marked these too.) Juxtaposing all the noisy action on the page, Jesus retreats to the wilderness (v. 12), silences an unclean spirit (v. 25), does not permit the demons to speak (v. 34), goes away to a deserted place to pray (v. 35), tells the healed man to keep quiet (v. 43), and ultimately begins preaching in deserted places (v. 45). This many instances of quiet become too loud to ignore on a page with so much activity.\n\nMark doesn’t waste any extra words saying what he wants us to know. From the very first line, he gets straight to the point: Jesus is “the Son of God” (v. 1). Later, God Himself addresses Jesus as His “beloved Son” (v. 11), and even the unclean spirit says to Jesus, “I know who You are—the Holy One of God!” (v. 24). According to Mark’s Gospel, Jesus’ divinity is non-negotiable. \n\nYou can see why the book of Mark appeals to me as a student of the Word. But that doesn’t keep it from being tender to my heart as well. “This is why I have come,” Jesus tells His disciples (v. 38). Not to be flashy, not to draw big crowds, but to preach the gospel with a contagious holiness that could drive out demons and heal the unclean. Yes, there is a lot of action, but the message is simple, spoken from the lips of Christ Himself: “Repent and believe in the good news!” (v.15).\n\nAs we embark on this journey into another exciting book of the Bible, let’s take out our pens, connecting our hands to our heads. Let’s pay attention to the inspired, intentional way this very unique book was written. But let’s not forget to also lay our pens down and engage our hearts, remembering Christ’s simple call to “repent and believe” that the gospel is true—that it is good news, and it is for all of us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebekah Lyons\n\nText: Mark 2:1-28, Mark 3:1-35, Hebrews 2:11-12\n\nI’m a fan of doctors, of their life-saving work. I’m not a fan of being the patient. \n\nI can always find a reason to avoid a visit. I’ll let an ailment linger for days, aiming to kick it with a home remedy or just some good ol’ fashioned pain tolerance. But a couple years ago, while living in downtown Manhattan, I couldn’t shake or will away an overwhelming, inexplicable illness. After writhing in pain for three days straight, common sense kicked in; I hailed a cab at midnight and headed to urgent care.\n\nDesperation will do this, when denial inevitably falls short.  \n\nThey gave me something to ease the immediate pain, and insisted I visit my primary care physician the next morning. We ran labs for three days and found that all my levels were off. I could barely walk, barely eat. I was coming off a season of constant adrenaline, and when the pace finally slowed, my body followed suit. I learned the hard way that forty years old is not equal to twenty. My top priority would become rest in order to give my body the healing it required.\n\nWhen I read the story of the paralytic in Mark, I’m struck by the desperation of his friends to see him healed. Perhaps he had suffered a lifetime of loss and missed opportunity. And since there was no taxi to be found at midnight, they simply needed to find a way to get him in front of the Great Physician.\n\nThere’s a crowd in the way? No matter. There’s a roof in the way? No matter. Nothing deterred them from getting the help they were seeking. Their faith in Jesus’ power to heal enabled them to break through any barrier—literally. \n\nTheir tenacity moved Jesus. Scripture says when He saw their persistent faith, He uttered, “Son, your sins are forgiven!” (Mark 2:5). Jesus started with the inner healing of the heart, but didn’t stop there. He then commanded the man to get up and walk so the resistant religious leaders could see He had the authority of God to not only heal bodies, but also to forgive sins. \n\nWe want the external; Jesus goes after the internal.\n\nWe want what is seen; Jesus goes after what is unseen.\n\nDid He want the man to walk? Absolutely. Did He go after the healing of his heart? Fundamentally. \n\nThe nature of Jesus never changes. He always heals, always redeems, always restores. Our role is to come. When we reach our moment of desperate brokenness, no longer denying our sickness of heart and mind, we will do whatever it takes to get well. There we will behold His face, hear His voice, and receive His healing touch. \n\nThat’s the gospel, simple and plain. Jesus said, “Those who are well don’t need a doctor, but the sick do need one. I didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners” (Mark 2:17). \n\nI want to be among the ones who know they are sinners—broken, weary, in desperate need of a Savior. I want to experience a break-through-the-rooftop kind of healing. I pray the Holy Spirit will convict me, moment by moment, again and again. His conviction is a grace, a kindness, and a revelation that all is not well. But the healing we need is found in the forgiveness of our Savior, Jesus.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Mark 4:1-41, Amos 4:13\n\nMy childhood house is on the market. (It still feels weird to say it.) On my favorite mountain, yes. On the street lined with elm trees, certainly. On school bus 24’s route, always. But on the market—for sale, like a cup of lemonade from the neighbor’s kid? No, thank you. \n\nThis is probably why homeowners aren’t invited to the Open House. It would just be too hard to let go. Still, I can’t help but want to give prospective buyers some helpful hints as to how to live in the house. Perhaps, I’d offer them a sticky note tour.\n\nWelcome to our—er, potentially your—new home! I’d write. Don’t worry about taking off your shoes; the puppy’s ruined the carpet already anyway. \n\nHere’s where we keep the plates. Silverware can be found in the drawer on the left, and the trash can’s under the sink. \n\nMy dad stoned in that fireplace the summer before I started high school, and my mom made the quilt draped over the couch the summer I graduated college.\n\nMake sure you leave this door open for the cat, and help yourself to snacks. (I hide the chocolate in the top right cabinet.) Keep the front door closed so you don’t let the raccoons in! (I’m serious.) \n\nIt’s then that I realize what I’ve tried so hard to forget: the house they’ll be moving into won’t have snacks or cats or hand-me-down china or my mother’s quilts. They won’t be joining my family in the house. After we move out, the sticky notes won’t make any sense. \n\nInitially, some of Jesus’ parables don’t make much sense either. As He talks about sowing and mustard seeds, I imagine the onlookers wondering how in the world any of it applied to faith. So, why did Jesus tell parables? Was He making His lessons easier to comprehend? Was He avoiding complicated theology? No, Jesus was actually choosing to not let them understand.\n\n“To those outside, everything comes in parables so that they may look and look, yet not perceive; they may listen and listen, yet not understand; otherwise, they might turn back—and be forgiven.”\n\n—Mark 4:11-12\n\nJesus’ instructions were meant for those living in His house—His Father’s house, the Kingdom of God. The secret of the Kingdom God isn’t a story or an equation, but a person. And a story without Him, the main character, isn’t a story, but a parable. \n\nWhen listeners don’t see Jesus as the entrance to the Kingdom, or are out to manipulate His words, He creates a fence around His house by telling a parable. Jesus proves that you don’t arrive at the Truth by becoming smarter, wealthier, or more important; you find Truth by following Him to His house! \n\nAs for His disciples, Christ never leaves them hanging. He’s always willing to explain the parables when asked and reassure them with Truth. Privately, He would explain everything to them (Mark 4:10). The Harvest has come. It is Me. I am here. Do not fear. \n\nAs Christ’s followers, we get to live in that house with a protective fence and no need for sticky notes because we have His Word, filled with all we’ll ever need know. Thanks be to God! \n\n“He is here: the One who forms the mountains, creates the wind, and reveals His thoughts to man, the One who makes the dawn out of darkness and strides on the heights of the earth.\n\nYahweh, the God of Hosts, is His name.”\n\n—Amos 4:13\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nText: Mark 5:1-43, Acts 9:39-41\n\nThe sheer magnitude of Christ’s sovereignty is a general theme of Mark chapter five. He is a really big God! The “Giant Jesus” motif of Mark’s gospel account actually begins at the end of chapter four, where the Good Shepherd proves He’s large and in charge. In the middle of a storm, He stands up in a rocky boat on the Sea of Galilee to calm the seas with this concise command: Peace. Be Still. With those three little words He confirms His complete authority over the natural world. \n\nAt the beginning of chapter five, Jesus demonstrates His supremacy over the supernatural world (Mark 5:1-13), and then goes on to prove His Lordship over death (Mark 5:35-43). But in my opinion, the best part of this passage is a story-within-a-story, which illustrates not only the incomparable power of Jesus, but also the tenderness of our big God (Mark 5:21-34).\n\nThe woman isn’t named, but she is framed by the symptom of her malady—blood—which was a gross violation of Jewish propriety (Leviticus 15:19-33). If you had an open wound or obvious hemorrhage, you were barred from communal activity, including worship. Much like a leper, this bleeding woman was considered ceremonially ”unclean.” She certainly wasn’t supposed to be in a public setting potentially contaminating her “clean” neighbors. \n\nBut she was so desperate for relief from her suffering that she chose to risk weaving her way through the crowd in hopes of touching the edge, or even just the tassels, of Jesus’ robe (Matthew 9 depicts this same story with that particular detail). \n\nHer trembling alone might have alerted Jesus to her presence (Mark 5:33). I imagine her there, breathing fast and hiding behind her veil, scared someone in the crowd would expose her for trampling on Torah rules, inciting a stern rebuke from the local priest, if not a stoning by the whole community.\n\nYet our compassionate Redeemer doesn’t reprimand her for breaking the law. Instead He leans in and listens to her whole story. Can you imagine how long it took her to explain the 12-year saga of losing her health, wealth, relationships, and reputation? \n\nAnd don’t forget the context here: Jesus is on His way to the home of a prominent local leader to attend to his dying daughter—a medical emergency, presumably one with priority. Besides, this woman’s already been healed physically. She’s had her turn, so to speak. It would’ve been completely understandable if Jesus had just kept on walking toward the gated community where Jairus lived. But He didn’t; instead, He stopped and gave His complete attention to a seemingly insignificant fringe-grabber.  \n\nOne of my favorite living authors is a lovely, humble pastor named Max Lucado. I’ve had the joy of getting to spend a little time with Max and his family over the past fifteen years, but prior to the privilege of meeting them personally, a friend shared a heart-warming observation she made while at a large gathering in their home. \n\nOne of the Lucado girls, who was six or seven at the time, idled over to the piano to play a simple tune she’d recently learned. When Max heard the first note, he politely excused himself from a serious conversation with several important publishing executives. Then he walked over, leaned against the wall next to the piano, and watched her play with obvious affection. He made his little girl feel like the most important person in the room that night. And she was—to her daddy, anyway.\n\nMark chapter five reminds us that while Jesus is the King of all kings, He’s also a perfectly personal Savior who delights in listening to His kids play Chopsticks. The beyond-colossal Ruler of the universe bends down to prove He’s absolutely crazy about you and me. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Mark 6:1-56, 2 Kings 2:11\n\nWhen Jesus invited His disciples to steal away, sit, and stop for a while, you can imagine how readily they took Him up on the offer. In a world where a young girl can ask for the head of a prophet on a platter, and see the king swiftly grant her wish for fear of looking like a fool (Matthew 6:24-26), Jesus’ followers must have wondered what they’d gotten themselves into. But they’d seen the Son of God in all His glory, healing and saving and bringing dead people back to life. They’d witnessed with their own eyes that He was who the prophet said He was. They believed! Most of the time.\n\nLife as one of the Twelve was certainly eventful. Some passages in Mark’s Gospel make it sound nothing short of chaotic. “Many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat,” Mark writes (v. 30). Sound familiar? The chaos swirls and the demands of the day rise like waves, ready to wipe out all our best intentions. But Jesus says, Come away. Find the quiet. Rest a while.\n\nThe disciples tried, but chaos followed. Jesus and the Twelve got into boats and sailed off “to a remote place” (v. 32). But someone caught sight of them and word spread, and there was a crowd waiting for them when they reached the shore.\n\nJesus, being the compassionate Son of God, got out of the boat and taught the people, right there at the edge of the shore, and kept teaching well into the night (v. 34). The disciples, naturally, got antsy. Send them away, they said. They must be hungry for dinner, they said. \n\nYou’re right, He said, You feed them. And when the disciples looked at Him like He was crazy, He gently nudged them forward to faith. He nudged them to believe.\n\nFeed them what? they asked. After all, He’d told them to bring nothing with them (v. 8). All they had was a few loaves and fishes… and Him.\n\nIt’s Me, you guys. Believe.\n\nAfter that miraculous feast, Jesus sent the disciples ahead again by boat, but chaos still followed—this time in the form of wind and waves. Jesus walked to them, holy feet on top of the water, and they cried out in fear at the sight. “Have courage!” He said. “Don’t be afraid” (v. 50).\n\nIt’s Me, you guys. Believe.\n\nAnd this would be the pattern. Where Jesus and the disciples went, a bluster of activity followed. People rushed through the streets to find Him, carrying the sick and ailing around on mats, hoping just to brush against the robe of the One who could heal. “And everyone who touched it was made well” (v. 56).\n\nThe Twelve saw it all; they were standing right there. Still, they struggled to believe. Still, Jesus had to constantly remind them that He was who He said He was.\n\nIt’s Me, you guys. Believe.\n\nWe’ve seen it, too, you know. Many of us have seen Jesus up close, in our lives and in His Word. We’ve seen Him change hearts and heal sickness and bring hope to the dark. And still, here in the chaos, we struggle to believe. \n\nBut the Son of God stands and calls to us, just as He called to the Twelve. He calls us to come away and rest for awhile, to remember He is who He says He is. Yes, we are weak and weary, but we are invited to stay near the very Son of God. We can rest in the knowledge that He still has the power to feed and calm and heal.\n\nIt really is Him, friends. We can believe. \n\n",

We talk about following it, as if it were a wise guide. We paint it onto greeting cards in February—beautiful, pink, and symmetrical. Can you imagine what a greeting card heart would look like if it were painted after the heart we read about in Mark 7? \n\nMaybe one side of it would be pretty and pink, but the other side? Scraggly, grey, ugly. A lopsided, scary-looking heart wouldn’t help greeting card sales, I know, but it would better match the heart Jesus talks about in this passage. He says that from our hearts come “evil thoughts, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders, adulteries, greed, evil actions, deceit, promiscuity, stinginess, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness” (Mark 7:21-22).\n\nThese evils are not caused by some outside force. They originate from within us (Mark 7:23). Nothing like being told your heart is the root of greed and evil actions to get your day going, right? But if we can sit with this truth for a little while, something very beautiful is revealed.\n\nI remember hearing my mom compliment her friend one time on how nice she looked. Her hair was fixed. She had on a new sweater. Her make-up was perfection. She looked lovely. \n\n“Thanks,” the friend said. “My mom always taught me that if you’re having a bad day, you can at least put on a cute outfit.”\n\nIsn’t this our natural response? To pull ourselves together from the outside in? We scrub our exterior as much as we can, hoping to fix what’s dirty and broken on the inside. This might look like a new outfit, or volunteering at church, or making sure you’re seen with the right crowd. None of those things are inherently wrong or bad, but when we do them in an attempt to heal something that feels broken, or to earn the approval of our Father, they begin to reflect what the Pharisees were doing: fixating on the law and rituals.\n\nJesus had something to say about these attempts of ours: “These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. They worship Me in vain” (Mark 7:6-7). Our rituals and outward behavior will not bring us into true communion with Christ because those things are not His primary concern. He is concerned with our hearts. He sees straight through the exterior into the real—into the dark, the grey, and the ugly.\n\nAnd here’s the beautiful part: Jesus chose to live right there, in our hearts, and to write the law under this new covenant. “I will put My laws into their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be My people” (Hebrews 8:10). \n\nThis is what makes the whole gospel thing such a life-changer. We don’t have to scrub ourselves clean. The blood of Christ has already done that.  \n\nIt’s all too easy for me to slide back into Pharisee mode, to put on a cute outfit and hope for the best. But Pharisee mode prevents true communion with Christ. Let’s not offer Him our perfectly-symmetrical-greeting-card hearts today. Let’s offer Him our real hearts and, in return, experience real worship.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText:  Mark 8:1-38, Mark 9:1, 2 Samuel 7:14-16, Daniel 7:13-14\n\nI love reading the book of Mark because he makes no apologies for Jesus’ seemingly oddball behavior. To bystanders, His acts might’ve seemed whacky or even alien—like He’s not from this world. You can see this so clearly in Mark chapter 8. \n\nAfter Jesus miraculously fed 4,000 people in the middle of nowhere and with next to nothing (Mark 8:17), He and His disciples boarded a boat. That’s where the disciples quickly realized they’d forgotten something essential: food. Somebody forgot the food!\n\nWhat follows might be one of the saddest statements recorded in the gospels. “Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: ‘Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?’” (Mark 8:17).\n\nHis statement was filled with great sorrow, not because the disciples were thick-headed, but because they were so deeply entrenched in the ways of this world that they still couldn’t trust the promises of heaven. Jesus wanted them to see that He is not bound by the limitations of the physical world, so neither were they. \n\nThe Son of God did not follow the rules of the world. Unconcerned about fame, He told those He’d healed to not to say a word (Mark 8:25). When His disciples professed their belief that He is the Messiah, Jesus told them to keep it under wraps (Mark 4:10-12). Jesus did the opposite of what someone trying to gather a following would do, because His fame was not bound to this earth.\n\nBut Peter desperately wanted Jesus to stay here on this earth. They were healing people, feeding people, changing lives! So when Jesus began to explain that He was preparing to die, it was no surprise that Peter told Him to stop talking such nonsense. After all, Jesus was only in His thirties. Death was a long way off. Wasn’t it?\n\nJesus’ words were a loving warning: “You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns” (Mark 8:33).\n\nWhat are your concerns today? Are you hungry? Are you deeply desiring a change in your life? Are you desperate for peace? Are you confused about which job to take, what city to move to, or how to discipline that child who just seems to laugh at you when you put her in time out? These are valid concerns. They are real. But they are temporary. \n\nLosing our life—picking up our cross to follow Him—doesn’t necessarily mean suffering death by political execution. As Christians, everyday life is our cross. We are called to live with God’s concerns at the forefront of our minds, even as the world is screaming its empty promises at us. \n\nJesus is calling us to believe that He is fighting for us while we are silent, while we are still (Exodus 14:14). He is inviting us to be whacky like Him—to be of another world altogether. Like our Messiah, we can hold loosely to this temporary life because we know there is another, more brilliant Kingdom that is our home. \n\nHis dominion is an everlasting dominion\n\nthat will not pass away,\n\nand His kingdom is one\n\nthat will not be destroyed.\n\n– Daniel 7:14\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Mark 9:2-50, Philippians 1:15-18\n\nI love to get down to business. If we are in a swimming pool, I can’t handle any of that standing and splashing around nonsense. I’d rather accomplish something and swim. If I have something important to tell you, I’ll rush it every time, forgetting to shoot the breeze first. I just love to keep things moving along and attend to the business at hand.\n\nWhen Peter suddenly finds himself face to face with Jesus, Moses, and Elijah transfigured, he immediately switches on his “Let’s do something!” response. Just look at his reaction. He doesn’t know what to do or say, so he scrambles and offers to build a tabernacle. Never mind that he doesn’t have tools or supplies. He sees God incarnate and his natural response is,  “Let’s build a place to honor—and maybe hide—some of this awful glory.”\n\nJust like Peter, when I think of how to interact with the glory of God, I want to rush to fix things, to hurry and set up the proper structure for Him. I’m inclined to scramble when faced with His glory, because I’m usually only focused on my own role instead of His.\n\nWhen Jesus appears transfigured with Moses and Elijah, one of the many things He’s proving is that He is His Father’s Man. He stands illuminated with Moses, a symbol of the Law, and Elijah, a symbol of the prophets, and shows us that He is the literal embodiment of both. But Jesus is not just some symbolic fulfillment; His actual person fulfills the words of the prophets and the strictures of the Law (Matthew 5:17). He is doing His Father’s will, and it is blindingly glorious.\n\nIn the face of this shining glory we find Peter. He was chosen by Christ to be the rock of the church (Matthew 16:18)—he’s a big deal among the disciples. But Peter was still trying to figure out what it really meant for Jesus to be who He is. I imagine it’s hard to see all the might and power of the universe sitting on the shoulders of a teacher and friend. On the Mount of Transfiguration, Peter is trying his best to work it all out. But his best is still human understanding, and when it comes to the infinite, there’s a point where we just have to acknowledge our limitations.\n\nWhen we glimpse the glory of God, we’re often like Peter: ready to go build tabernacles (or whatever seems right for the moment) and get started right away. But God speaks and gently redirects us, saying, “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!” (Mark 9:7). \n\nLater, when Jesus heals the sick child, the response of the boy’s father is beautiful, yet simple: I do believe, but help me to understand (Mark 9:24, my paraphrase). Peter’s response could have been the same as that grieving father’s: Jesus! I believe. Help me to understand!\n\nIt’s not about me. It’s not about my belief or my ability to solve problems quickly. It’s about Christ revealed. God’s own glory is the centerpiece, not any human notion. \n\nFather, give us eyes to see as You see.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Mark 10:1-52, Isaiah 51:17, 1 Peter 4:13\n\nI’ll never forget the day Larry broke his neck. Wedged between cardboard boxes and covered in bubble wrap, my beloved rocking horse sat in the corner of a moving truck that would take him to my family’s new house, states away. \n\nMy dad dreamed up Larry shortly after I was born. He carefully calculated each detail, making sure it was short enough for my little-girl stature, wide enough to fill the empty corner of my bedroom, and colorful enough to make me cheer with delight. His creation was the perfect combination of mint green, pastel yellow, flowered harness, rope hair, and toddler joy. \n\nBut one sharp turn and a loud “crack!” later, Larry toppled into the truck’s side, breaking in two. I can only imagine the nightmares the poor truck driver probably still has after coming between a little girl and her rocking horse. \n\nAs I’ve become more aware of brokenness, I’ve realized it doesn’t always make a loud “crack!” As people fractured since the Fall, do we even notice the cracks? It’s easier to classify some things as broken: adultery, sickness, murder. But I’m slow to remember their opposites—marriage, wellness, friendship—are cracked too. Even our best is broken. \n\nC.S. Lewis reminds us that even our joy is broken:\n\n“We are half-hearted creatures, fooling around with drink\n\nand sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us,\n\nlike an ignorant child who wants to go on making\n\nmud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what\n\nis meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are\n\nfar too easily pleased.”\n\nFar too easily pleased. Friends, this doesn’t mean we’re low-maintenance children of God. Rather, we are refusing to believe God is the supreme good. \n\nIn Mark 10, the crowds are asking Jesus questions about the Kingdom of God, each one revealing their half-heartedness; they want His approval on matters of divorce, salvation, and money. God never approves brokenness, but He does send someone to heal it. How easily we forget this truth. Even our memories are cracked!\n\nWe are adulterers; He remains committed to us.\n\nWe want possessions; He calls us His.\n\nWe are broken; He is whole.\n\nThe crowd asks pointed questions as they pick up the earthly, broken pieces to see where they belong in the big puzzle of the Kingdom of God. In each of His responses, we see Jesus point to God’s divine creation (v. 6), joining together (v. 9), covenant promise (v. 39), and sacred union (v. 39). Jesus mends even the brokenness we cannot see. \n\nAlthough Larry’s neck is now held together by Super Glue®, I love him the same way I did right after the final coat of paint was finished and I could behold my dad’s complete and perfect work.\n\nDespite our false notions and obvious cracks, Jesus looks at us the same way, remembering His Father’s creation and perfect union. “Come, follow me,” He says (v. 21). Like the healed blind man who can now see, may we follow Him on the road to His Kingdom. Amen. \n\nWake yourself, wake yourself up!\n\nStand up, Jerusalem,\n\nyou who have drunk the cup of His fury\n\nfrom the hand of the Lord;\n\nyou who have drunk the goblet to the dregs—\n\nthe cup that causes people to stagger.\n\n—Isaiah 51:17\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Mark 11:1-33, Zechariah 9:9, Psalm 118:25-26\n\nThe day our son was born, I was astonished.\n\nThe mere reality of birth was a surprise. One minute, there were four people in the room, and the next minute, there were five. The baby who was theoretically growing in my belly for nine months was an actual human being—he was here! He looked nothing like I’d expected, and his birth didn’t go anything like I’d planned, but he was here. I was shocked by how immediately I felt like a mother; the pride and protective instincts I felt for my child caught me off guard. The whole experience can only be described as astonishing. Unexpected, yet wonderful.\n\nFast forward six years. My baby boy was a kindergarten rock star, but one man hundreds of miles away made me feel fear like I’d never known. I was at the grocery store not far from my son’s school when I heard the news that Sandy Hook Elementary had been attacked by a gunman. Boys and girls my own child’s age were terrorized, injured, even killed.\n\nI’ll never forget counting the minutes until my little boy’s eyes met mine as he pounced, carefree, off his yellow school bus. He was fine, but I was not. I was not astonished that day; I was afraid. I wept into the night, praying for protection for my own son, and comfort for the mothers and fathers and children in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, whose lives would never be the same. \n\nAstonished and afraid. There’s a big difference, isn’t there? When I read Mark 11, I notice both of these reactions to Jesus upon His arrival in Jerusalem. Some were astonished and others were afraid.\n\nIn verse 18, just after Jesus overturned the tables and chairs in the temple, Scripture says the chief priests began “looking for a way to destroy Him. For they were afraid of Him.” But the crowd? In that very same moment, they were “astonished by His teaching.”\n\nLater, in verses 30-32, the chief priests weren’t able to give an answer to Jesus’ question about John’s baptism. Why? Because “they were afraid of the crowd.”\n\nThis dichotomy appears often in Jesus’ ministry—the crowds are astonished and the religious leaders are almost always afraid. In Mark 1:11, when Jesus cleansed a man of an unclean spirit, Scripture says the crowd was “astonished at His teaching because, unlike the scribes, He was teaching them as one having authority.”  \n\nThis dichotomy of astonishment and fear appears in our lives, too. We’re astonished at the skill of Olympic athletes, and we are afraid of heights. We are astonished by double rainbows, and we are afraid of loud thunderstorms. As we read the reactions of those who received Jesus’ authority and those who hoped to explain it away, I wonder, How do I react when I encounter Jesus’ authority in my own life? \n\nDoes it make me afraid? Does it compel me to hold tight to the things I love, lest He shake up my plans?  \n\nOr do I feel astonished at His power, the same way I was astonished at the wonder of meeting my baby boy? Am I surprised and delighted by the way Jesus works in ways I do not expect?\n\nAs we read the book of Mark today, let’s notice the authority with which Jesus rides into Jerusalem like the King that He is, how He surveyed the temple quietly in verse 11, then commanded the fig tree to wither in verse 14. Let’s watch the “unexpected, yet wonderful” way Jesus cleanses His Father’s house and answers the chief priests as they attempt to usurp Him. \n\nBecause Jesus is our King, and He is God’s Son, His authority doesn’t have to make us afraid. We can simply watch, astonished by the King of Kings, who has all authority in heaven and on earth!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nText: Mark 12:1-44, Isaiah 5:1-5, 1 Peter 2:4-8\n\nMany of us have heard the parable of the tenants found in Mark chapter 12. The owner of a vineyard leases it to careless tenants who eventually kill his son in order to keep the spoils for themselves. It’s about God’s chosen people, the Israelites, the ones who thought the work of salvation would take gusto and bravado, laws and legalities. \n\nBut they forgot who owned the vineyard, the grapes, and the wine, and that He’d only allotted it all to them for a time. Then one day He took it back and gave it to the entire world: to the Gentiles, Samaritans, Romans—the ends of the earth—and now to you and me. \n\nSometimes I find myself still tending to the vineyards and missing out on the feast He’s preparing (Isaiah 25:6). I swat at the people He sends my way, kill the inklings of hope in His name, and fight off those coming my way only to serve. \n\nI try to sacrifice Christ again and again with my sore attempts at gaining my own righteousness. I try to produce prize fruit on the merit of my own labors. Because when I laid my crowns at the feet of Jesus, I certainly expected to pick them back up somewhere along the way.\n\nPaul warns Christians that, to be in relationship with Jesus, we’d actually have to fellowship in His sufferings, becoming like Him in His death (Philippians 3:10). I must not have understood this because I most definitely did not expect to be so trampled down (Isaiah 5:1-5).\n\nI am the irresponsible tenant and the wild, overgrown grapes. I have mistreated my Father’s things and I have grown wild in going my own way. I have turned away from His feast, certain I can prepare and keep a better one. I have not submitted to His pruning, certain I can handle the shears on my own. But the ruined vineyard and the irresponsible tenants are no match for the Vinedresser.  \n\nHe clears the field again, gathers those stones again, and sets in its corner a Stone greater than all the other stones (Mark 12:10). He resurrects it again—stone by stone by living stone—building it all together into a temple for the Holy Spirit, leveling it on the ground of His Son, solid and firm (1 Peter 2:4-8). And the vineyards within bear fruit in abundance—the work of the Holy Spirit, the Vinedresser, and the Son in unison with one another. \n\nThis is the work of fruitful farming in the field of faith: to know He will send friend after friend to help guide us back to the right path. He will trample to death that which doesn’t bear fruit and He will even prune what’s good to make it healthier—and sometimes we won’t know the difference. This is the work of faith, to believe and to tend, to submit and to bear fruit. But it’s all done under the watchful, caring eye of the Vinedresser, within the safe haven of the living stones, and on the bedrock of the Cornerstone, Christ alone.\n\n",

(NO TEXTING AND DRIVING!) It’s a map app that updates in real time when there are accidents or other hazards on the road. It even updates for speed traps. \n\nA few months ago, as I was driving back home to Nashville, the app sounded its alert. There had been a major accident forty or so miles ahead, meaning my trip would be extended by thirty minutes.\n\nI appreciated the alert, but didn’t love the news. \n\nWithin a few miles, the app beeped at me again with a new route. I was supposed to get off the interstate at the next exit and weave through backwoods Tennessee for thirty miles. I’d never been that way before, and I had no idea where I was going; but the app did, and that was enough for me. \n\nAfter doing the bob and weave down two-lane country roads, I began to run parallel to the interstate and could see it backed up for miles and miles. Cars were stopped dead in their lanes, and drivers were out walking among them as the highway was now completely shut down. Now traveling in a steady stream of moving cars tracing the back roads, I wondered if they all had the same app and directions as me. Soon our caravan of strangers got back on the interstate right past the overturned tractor trailer, giving us a clear path back to Nashville.\n\nI felt sorry for the people stuck in the traffic. They had no idea what was coming when they were casually driving up I-24. And while it wouldn’t have changed the situation (that poor, unfortunate tractor trailer strewn across four lanes of traffic), it sure would have changed their response to it!\n\nThat traffic app is kind, in a weird way. It sees what I can’t see, warns me of things I want to avoid. It makes me feel safer to have the information.\n\nMaybe that’s what Jesus was doing on the hilltop overlooking Jerusalem. He chose to protect and care for the disciples—and us—through very hard times, by warning us that they were on the way (Mark 13:5-8). \n\nEvery building will fall apart?\n\nWars and rumors of wars?\n\nKingdom against kingdom?\n\nIt sounds scary and dangerous and altogether bad. This could not have been the disciples’ favorite conversation they’d ever had with Jesus. But what might sound harsh and frightening is really an act of Jesus’ love and protection. \n\nDo these warnings ever terrify me? WELL, SURE. But they are not meant to bring fear or worry. They are Jesus’ kindness to us. He sees what we cannot see, and sprinkles in a new set of directions throughout the text. “Be on your guard,” He tells us. “I have told you everything ahead of time” (Mark 13:23). And for that, we should be so grateful. \n\nWe can trust Jesus, no matter what is coming around the bend. We may not avoid pain and suffering along the way, but He promises we will see Him in the midst of it—because He’s already there.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Mark 14:1-72, Isaiah 53:2-3\n\nWaste not, want not. Right?\n\nWhen the woman at Bethany cracked the expensive jar of oil and poured it over Jesus’ head, her relatives flared their nostrils and demanded, “Why has this fragrant oil been wasted?” It seemed like a good question because the jug of oil was worth 300 denarii (Mark 14:4-5). Considering a day’s wages in Palestine at that time was one denarius (Matthew 20:2), this woman poured out a year’s wages on Jesus’ head, and all she had to show for it was oily hands.\n\nBut Jesus wiped His eyes and celebrated her gift, announcing that she had anointed His body in advance for burial. Indeed, in this chapter, the longest in the Gospel of Mark, we see Jesus in the center of several kinds of preparation as He walked through the days that led Him inexorably to the cross. \n\nThe preparations began with a plot to kill Jesus (v. 1), followed by the parenthetical anointing to prepare His body (v. 8). This led to the disciples’ preparation for Passover (v. 12) and concluded with Jesus’ prediction of betrayal (v. 18). And in the middle of all this preparation and betrayal, Jesus stopped and instituted the Lord’s Supper. He was preparing them for life without Him. \n\nIt makes sense that this indelible sacrament—one of His dearest gifts to us—was given as He was surrounded by betrayal on one side and suffering on the other. But the gospel is only realized in suffering. In fact, there is no gospel apart from Christ’s suffering. \n\nAs He broke the bread and offered up His body, Jesus was really giving us His whole “person” (Aramaic), His entire “being” (Greek). He then took the cup and said to them, “This is My blood that establishes the covenant; it is shed for many” (vv. 22-24). The Last Supper is the truest representation of our fellowship with Christ, and in this meal we see that His gift to us was complete.\n\nThe guests at Jesus’ final table would go on to betray Him—and not just Judas. In the end, they all deserted Him (v. 50). But even the most evil plots of men are within the scope of God’s providence. Isaiah prophesied that Jesus would be “despised and rejected by men” (Isaiah 53:3), and so it is fitting that the Lord’s Last Supper was attended by traitors. \n\nThe Lord’s Supper is not a table of virtue; it is a table of grace. Even on our best days we cannot earn His gift. He invites us to partake just as He invited the disciples—in spite of our betrayals and scheming against Him. Apart from Christ’s suffering, there simply is no gospel. \n\nNone of these preparations or promises made sense until He went to the cross. The great mystery of the gospel is revealed in Jesus’ death. \n\nThe jar that was broken to anoint Jesus was a complete gift. No one could pick up the shards and piece the pottery back together for another use later; the jar was smashed and irrevocably given (Mark 14:3). Christ was crushed for us, and His sacrifice is also freely, entirely, and totally given. We remember this every time we partake of the Lord’s Supper (Isaiah 53:5). His extravagant gift to us was not wasted and has changed the world forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Mark 15:1-47, Psalm 38:20-22, Hebrews 5:7-10\n\nHere we are at Mark 15—the crucifixion of our Savior. Would you enter into this text with me?\n\nAt the start of this chapter, we find Jesus standing before a crowd of chief priests, elders, and scribes. These men, along with Pilate, do not believe Jesus is the Son of God, and they accuse Him of many things.  \n\nFrom there, Jesus is taken in front of an even greater crowd, a “multitude.” They, too, refuse to believe He is the Son of God, and demand for Him to die a criminal’s death.\n\nThen, the soldiers take Him away and clothe Him in a robe and a crown of thorns. “Hail, King of the Jews!” they yell (Mark 15:18). But they don’t actually believe Jesus is the Son of God, and so they mock Him, beat Him, and then lead Him away. \n\nNow, as Jesus hangs on the cross, the bystanders and passersby do not believe He is the Son of God. They blaspheme Him and taunt Him. \n\nIt seems everyone—Pilate, the chief priests, the multitude, the soldiers—has denied who Christ is. Nobody believes. All are blind and darkness consumes them, both literally and metaphorically. \n\nThis is our Good Friday sermon, and we know it well. We know we have to wait until Sunday, resurrection day, before we can talk about hope and life. But if we look closely at this chapter, we see a glimmer of hope begin to slide its way in, right here, in the ninth hour as the darkness lifts and Jesus cries out His final words: “‘Eloi, Eloi, lemá sabachtháni?’ which is translated, ‘My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?’” (Mark 15:34).\n\nUntil this moment, all we have seen and heard is denial, skepticism, and accusation toward Christ. Now, in the midst of all these voices, rises one who believes: “When the centurion, who was standing opposite Him, saw the way He breathed His last, he said, ‘This man really was God’s Son!’” (Mark 15:39).\n\nFinally, the truth is spoken about who Jesus really is.\n\nAfter the centurion, Mark mentions the other believers who were present, like Mary Magdalene, “many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem,” and Joseph of Arimathea (v. 40-41). The story is still dark, Sunday is not yet here, but as these people are highlighted amongst the unbelievers, we begin to feel all is not lost.\n\nWhen I read the centurion’s words, I am reminded that our disbelief can never be so strong that it will change the truth about who Christ is. In our darkest moments, when everyone around us—in our country, school, workplace, or home—seems to deny Him, Jesus will always be the Son of God. Nothing we say or do, no amount of denial, can change that. What God ordained from the beginning of time cannot be thwarted by a mob. That was true in Mark 15, and it’s true today. \n\nI am really anxious for us to get to the next part of the story, the beautiful resurrection and the hopeful ascension. But as believers, we know there is hope smack dab in the middle of the darkness. All we have to do is look up at the cross and declare what that centurion did so many years ago. Only this time, let’s use present tense: This man really is God’s Son!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Mark 16:1-20, Acts 1:6-11, Isaiah 53:4-6\n\nWe’ve called Mark “the Gospel of Jesus on His feet,” and now we’ve seen it to be true.\n\nThrough fifteen chapters, we have watched as Jesus went about Galilee preaching the good news and healing the sick, feeding the hungry and teaching His disciples what it means to believe. We saw Him stand on His feet before the chief priests and their accusations, with only silence and truth as His defense. We saw Him climb a mountain and walk on water.\n\nBut then, the Gospel of Jesus on His feet came to an abrupt halt. The Messiah was led to a cross and crucified. One day. Two days. Three days in the ground, and then He was up again. The stone was rolled away, and a man shimmering in white stood to greet the women in the tomb. There was no body for them to anoint; He was gone. Jesus had been raised from the dead.\n\nAnd that’s how the Gospel of Jesus on His feet resumes, right here in Mark 16. Only now, everything has changed.\n\nHere, at the very end of Mark’s Gospel, there is a crucial shift: Jesus had completed the work He came to earth to do. He had healed and taught and traveled and forgiven and died and risen. And then, He commissioned.\n\nJesus implored and empowered His disciples to continue the ministry He began—the same disciples who, even upon hearing eyewitness testimony of Jesus’ resurrection, still didn’t believe until they saw Him for themselves. He called them to preach the gospel. Now, you go, He said to them. You heal. You teach. You spread the message of the forgiveness of sins. Get on your feet and go.  \n\nJesus called His disciples to stand up and step out, and then He did something stunning: He sat down.\n\n“Then after speaking to them, the Lord Jesus was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.”\n\n– Mark 16:19\n\nStill today, Jesus sits at the right hand of His Father. He sits because the saving work He came to do here on earth has been done. He declared as much from the cross when He cried out, “It is finished” (John 19:30). The act of salvation is sealed and cannot be undone. Now, with the assurance that our Lord lives and reigns, we get to respond to His call: Get on your feet, and go.\n\nThe disciples were not alone as they went. Jesus had promised to go with them (John 14:26), and He did.\n\n“And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them…”\n\n– Mark 16:20\n\nFriends, the Gospel of Mark is not just the “Pedestrian Gospel” because of the action of the fast-paced narrative. The Gospel of Mark is the Pedestrian Gospel because it is the plainly presented message of the gospel of Jesus Christ—the forgiveness of sins accomplished in full by His life, death, and resurrection. It is the Gospel for all of us. For her and him, for you and me.  \n\nWe’ve not just heard about Him. We’ve seen Him. By His power and grace, let’s get up and carry His good news to the world. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nThe older I get, the more wary I am of getting my hopes up. I’d hoped to get the lead in the school play, but I got a secondary role instead. I’d hoped to get into a master’s program, but I didn’t. I’d hoped that relationship would work out, but it ended. Because of this, I have become very good at what I call “hope management.” I never let my hopes get too high. In doing so, when my hopes fall, the landing is softer.\n\nThis is why I can’t blame Zechariah for questioning the angel Gabriel when he tells him, “Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will name him John” (Luke 1:13). Zechariah protests. He was an “old man” and his wife, Elizabeth, “was well along in years.” Although Zechariah was clearly in the midst of a heavenly encounter, his question has undertones of disbelief: “How can I know this?” (v.18).\n\nThis tells me that Zechariah and Elizabeth had gotten their hopes up about a child before, and Zechariah can’t face the disappointment again. He can’t name another unborn child in expectation, only to have those expectations dashed. But as a result of Zechariah’s unbelief, he is unable to speak until the day his son is born and he sees God’s promise fulfilled.\n\nMary’s response to Gabriel is different. She is told something equally unbelievable––that she, a virgin, will conceive a child. Gabriel instructs, “You will name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end” (vv.31–33).\n\nBut Mary’s question is more logistical than it is incredulous: “How can this be?” (v.34). As the CSB Study Bible says, “The difference between Mary’s response… and Zechariah’s is that Mary asked her question not from unbelief but from puzzlement.”\n\nThe nation of Israel had high hopes for a Savior for generations. I would not blame Mary for containing her hope. But she does the opposite. While Zechariah’s mouth was closed, Mary’s opens in praise: “My soul praises the greatness of the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior” (vv.46–47).\n\nThese words reflect the type of unmanaged, unharnessed hope I want to have in response to the promises of God. Instead of reserving my hope, smothering it, not letting it get too high, I want to hold hope with open hands, believing the Lord will do what He says, that He will make good on His promise to save.\n\nWhat I have that Mary didn’t at this point in her life is the end of the story. I know God made good on His promise to save. When that is where my hope lies, I cannot be not disappointed, and instead, I can declare:\n\n“The Mighty One has done great things for me, and His name is holy. \n\nHis mercy is from generation to generation” (vv.49–50).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nWhat is a book you’ve read again and again? Or perhaps a movie you’ve seen more times than you can count? Or a song you’ve had on repeat for years? Though I’ve read the words of my favorite book or watched the same scene of my favorite movie a dozen times, I often react to it differently depending on the day I’ve had or the season of life I’m in. I may feel a lot of emotion, or I may feel inspired. Other times, I may simply want to listen, watch, and savor the story. Let the words and notes sink in.\n\nSomething I love about Luke’s narrative of Christ’s birth is the array of responses from those who witnessed the Messiah, either at His birth or soon after. From awe to silence to praising God, I think we can learn as much about the significance of the incarnation from these responses as we can from the details of the birth itself.\n\nMary’s response to her son’s birth is quiet and contemplative. While the shepherds, after meeting Jesus, ran off and told everyone about what they had seen, Scripture says, “Mary was treasuring up all the things in her heart and meditating on them” (Luke 2:19). She savored the moment, holding it near to her, letting it sink into her heart and mind.\n\nSimeon, the righteous servant of the Lord, responded to meeting the Messiah by praising God and declaring the mighty works Jesus would do. As he tells Mary, “Indeed, this child is destined to cause the fall and rise of many in Israel” (v.34).\n\nThen there is Anna, the prophetess. Her response to the Messiah’s arrival was gratitude and, like the shepherds’, to spread the good news: “At that very moment, she came up and began to thank God and to speak about Him to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem” (v.38).\n\nJesus’s birth evoked silent awe, praise, gratitude, and the need to tell everyone about it.\n\nMost likely, the story of Jesus’s birth is not new for you. You’ve probably read it or heard it told again and again. But I wonder, what is it evoking in you today? Awe, joy, gratitude, praise? Do you want to shout about it from the rooftops like Anna, or do you want to be still and treasure it in your heart, as Mary did? Though our responses will vary, we are united by the reason behind the coming of the Messiah. \n\n“God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law,\n\nso that we might receive adoption as sons” (Galatians 4:4–5). \n\nWe are redeemed. We are adopted. We are a part of God’s family. No matter what kind of day you are having or what sort of season you are in—quiet and contemplative or loud and joyful—let the story of Christ’s birth remind you of these truths today.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nFrom what I can tell, John the Baptist was a man to be respected. He spoke with authority. Others came to him to be baptized. They asked him for advice. They called him teacher. Many of them even wondered if he was the Messiah.\n\nJohn could have told the crowd anything by the Jordan River that day, and the people probably would have followed him, but John used his God-given authority to point them to Christ: \n\n“I baptize you with water, but one who is more powerful than I am is coming.\n\nI am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals.\n\nHe will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire” (Luke 3:16).\n\nSeveral years ago, I took a trip to Italy with some friends. We visited the Vatican in hopes of seeing the renowned Sistine Chapel, where Michelangelo painted the ceiling. Tourist-friendly signs dotted the Vatican campus with the words “Sistine Chapel” and an arrow pointing in its direction. Or so we thought. Many of the signs simply pointed us to the next sign that said “Sistine Chapel.” We followed sign after sign until we almost gave up.\n\n“The Sistine Chapel isn’t here!” we declared dramatically. “These signs are lying to us.”\n\nWe did eventually wind our way to the chapel and see what we had come to see, but only after several detours that took us by other Vatican sites and gift shops.\n\nAs Christ-followers, we have been given a similar charge as John the Baptist—to be signs pointing toward the coming Christ. And yet, how often do I squander this opportunity? How often do I use my voice to point first to myself, rather than Christ? Speaking with authority, I take friends and loved ones on a detour of my own gospel. I give them all of my advice and all of my opinions when really what they need first is the comfort of Christ, the love of the Savior. \n\nAt the same time, I have often been a sucker for the signs, looking to others’ authority before Christ’s,  settling for my favorite pastor’s, author’s, or podcaster’s words, rather than allowing Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection to have the final word. \n\nAs we see in the response to John the Baptist, we are a people quick to worship humans and look for guidance from earthly sources. Many people claim to have authority. Dozens of signs promise to get you where you want to go, but there is only one Christ, only one Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world—and that is not John the Baptist, but the One to whom he was pointing. \n\nMay we look to Christ alone as our authority, and may we point others to Him as well, always quick to say, “one who is more powerful than I am is coming.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nTo begin His public ministry, Jesus returns to His hometown of Nazareth and preaches in the synagogue. His homecoming message is so controversial, the townspeople—the people He had known since He was a child—“drove him out of town, and brought him to the edge of the hill… intending to hurl him over the cliff” (Luke 4:29).\n\nThe crowd is with Him for the first part of His message, when He quotes the prophet Isaiah, saying He had come to preach the good news and to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor (vv.18–19). But when He mentions the widow in Sidon whom the prophet Elijah helped, and Naaman, the Syrian whom Elisha healed, the crowd gets upset. These are stories of Gentiles who were shown favor above Israelites.\n\nThe crowd would have been familiar with these stories, and they would have known their meaning. This good news Jesus was preaching was for everyone, not just the Israelites but the Gentiles also—not a popular opinion among God’s chosen people, as we can see from their response.\n\nNow, I’ve had some difficult homecomings. I’ve had disagreements with friends and family from time to time, but none of them has ever been so displeased with me that they attempted to hurl me off a cliff.\n\nIn this passage and elsewhere in Scripture, we see a common response to Jesus: People wanted His miracles, but not His message.\n\nThe crowd is amazed when He casts out a demon in Capernaum. They bring their sick to Him to be healed. They follow Him around, hoping to see Him perform other miracles. But when Jesus preaches the truth in the synagogue? They want to kill Him.\n\nJesus’s miracles were amazing, yes, but His message was convicting. People like to be amazed. They don’t like to feel convicted.\n\nI know, in my own privilege, I often prefer the turns-water-into-wine Jesus over the seeks-justice-for-all Jesus. If Jesus is just a miracle worker, I can sit back and enjoy the show. But if Jesus is first and foremost a justice-seeker, I have to get in the ring and be about His work.\n\nJesus’s message in the synagogue proves His priority was not to amaze us with His power, but to redeem us—Jews and Gentiles alike—with His blood.\n\nI can see myself in the Galilean crowd that tried to keep Jesus from leaving so they could witness more healings. I need the reminder Jesus turned and gave them: “It is necessary for me to proclaim the good news about the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because I was sent for this purpose” (v.43).\n\nThis is our purpose too. May we seek after Christ because we want to do as He did, not watch from the stands. May we remember that Jesus is our Redeemer, not a performer. And while we can stand in awe of His power to heal and cast out demons, may we be most amazed by His power to save.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nIntellect and logic would have told Jesus’s first disciples not to follow Him. They hardly knew the guy. They had stable jobs as fishermen and tax collectors. By the world’s logic, they shouldn’t have left steady paychecks to follow a practical stranger! But Jesus told Peter, James, and John, “Don’t be afraid; from now on you will fish for people” (Luke 5:10 NIV). No questions asked. No curiosity expressed at the utter strangeness of this statement. What do you mean, “fish for people”?  The men simply “left everything, and followed him” (v.11).\n\nIt was the same with Matthew. Jesus hadn’t yet shaken Matthew’s hand before He was inviting the man along, saying, “Follow me!” Matthew’s response? Leaving everything behind, “he got up and began to follow him” (vv.27–28).\n\nAs a result of the disciples’ responses, they ended up on the adventure of a lifetime. Full of pain and heartache, yes, but oh, how it was worth it.\n\nWhile reading today’s passage, I found myself feeling jealous of the disciples’ seemingly easy faith—and resonating with the Pharisees’ suspicious and questioning attitude. In some seasons, faith is easy. My heart believes. I see God at work and can faithfully follow. These days, faith is not coming as easily. My head is loud: This isn’t practical! This isn’t logical! Make a better plan for yourself! My heart is afraid: What if this doesn’t work out? What if Jesus was wrong? What if this will all be for nothing? I am uncertain of taking the next step Christ is calling me to. I am wary of the unlit path before me, even with Christ beside me.\n\nBut what does Jesus say? Don’t be afraid. Follow me.\n\nPerhaps the disciples’ faith is not the point here, so much as Jesus’s belief in them. He had faith in Peter, James, John, and Matthew, didn’t He? He saw something in them they did not see in themselves, or else He wouldn’t have asked them to follow Him. Maybe when my faith feels weak, I do not need to muster more. Maybe it’s enough to remember I was called. Sometimes faith precedes the step. Sometimes it comes after.\n\nThe response to Jesus by these first disciples is immediate and whole-hearted. They leave everything behind. They follow Him—not because they are pious or perfect, but because Jesus is worth following. All they know at this point is they want to be near Him. So do I. Let’s surrender our hearts and our heads to Christ today. Let Him lead us on the unlit path. It may have pain and heartache, but oh, my friends, I think it will be worth it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nHave you ever missed the party while it was happening? Looking back, you realized, Oh man, that was it! The magic was happening right in front of me and I didn’t see it! I find myself in this situation again and again. Hiking on a mountain but missing the view on account of stinging flies. Or brushing off my children’s impromptu theatrical performances to keep to my own schedule. I even remember being so caught up in the minutiae of pins, flowers, and curling irons on my sister’s wedding day that I forgot to take in the simple beauty and goodness of my sister transformed into a bride until we found ourselves giggling in the bathroom at her reception.\n\nWe are all prone to miss the important things. In the moment, it can be tough to even know whether something is vital until it’s too late. The Pharisees are missing a tremendous moment that is right in front of them. Because Christ wasn’t what they expected, they turned off their sense of expectation. But that’s the thing: Christ does not appear as we want Him to. His law, His logic, His person, His actions, even His teaching, do not conform to man’s way of thinking or living. He comes as Lord of the Sabbath, and if we are caught up like the Pharisees in what we imagine that to be, we miss Him as He is.\n\nIndeed, He is Lord of a kingdom that cuts against the grain of every human inclination. When He calls the twelve, He doesn’t pick from among the great or accomplished. He chooses the lowly, the ordinary, even the despised. When He heals, He does not curry favor with the high and mighty, but heals foreigners and the weak. His Beatitudes and the woes that follow overturn every modern notion of morality, self-esteem, and success. His call not to judge, but to love even our enemies, runs counter to every inclination toward self-justification and vengeance.\n\nThere are only two foundations: the foundation of Christ or the foundation of man’s natural disposition, which crumbles and fails. Instead of depending on the foundations that we build ourselves, we can stand on the foundation of the Lord of the Sabbath and stand secure. If we’re expecting Christ to be our personal sentimental version of newborn baby Jesus, we are going to miss the majesty and truth of Him as Lord of All.\n\nHere is the good news: Though we are prone to hypocrisy, to blindness, to judgment and folly, Christ comes to us anyway; He comes, loving His enemies and doing good to those who despise Him. He makes us His, and we can take comfort in this promise: “Everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher” (Luke 6:40). Christ calls us away from ourselves to Himself, and in so doing, makes us like Himself. “We know that when he appears, we will be like him because we will see him as he is” (1 John 3:2).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThis year, as part of our celebratory Christmas decorations, we set up a fantastic black-and-cream toy train under the tree. Once a day, I would let the kids play with it for a few minutes. They would sit on their tiny knees, leaning forward and exclaiming while the train made its allotted brave journey around the tree several times. Then I’d remind them to turn it off and move on with their day.\n\nOne of my best friends laughed at me for this, saying, “You’re limiting their Christmas magic so you don’t have to spend money on replacement batteries?!” Yeah, I guess I do tend to be a little parsimonious when it comes to… well, everything. Some of us are miserly with our resources. Maybe you are a bit freer with your spending; we’re all different. But if I had an alabaster jar filled with perfume I would reluctantly parse it out over many years, and I’d be hard-pressed to slop it all out in one afternoon over a stranger.\n\nWhether you are free or tight with resources, it’s important to know when it’s time to set aside your personal inclinations. Otherwise, we are like the Pharisee who invited Jesus to his house but held back on the hospitality. If the Pharisee had realized Who was sitting at his table, and what debt of gratitude he owed Him, would he have been so close-fisted in his actions? And centuries later, knowing Jesus’s purpose and intent, would we have washed His feet and offered Him a kiss? Unless we are aware of our great debt of love, it’s hard to remember who we are and what we are called to do.\n\nWhen we realize how much we have received—how much we have been forgiven—then everything comes into perspective. We too often hold back pieces of our lives for ourselves, because we fail to see how greatly we have been forgiven. If we were to comprehend the full abundance of God’s forgiveness, how could we hold back anything from Him? In Him we have received all things, beyond what we could ask or imagine.\n\nLike the woman in Luke 7, we who have been forgiven much can appreciate the depth of Christ’s love. The more we see our need of Him, the more opportunity we have for gratefulness and love for His deep forgiveness. He doesn’t speak of the woman’s shame, only of her love.\n\nIn John’s vision of heaven, the twenty-four elders cast their crowns at the feet of Christ, crying out: “Our Lord and God, you are worthy to receive glory and honor and power!” (Revelation 4:11). Everything changes because of who Christ is. By His sacrifice, He has given us abundant forgiveness and overwhelming love. He calls us to live our lives in thankfulness—and when we remember who He is and what He has done, how can we keep from falling at His feet in grateful love?\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Parables and Miracles",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nJesus used parables to teach both the crowds and His disciples. Typically, He first spoke the parable in the hearing of all, and then in private explained it to His disciples. But even the disciples were curious about this, and so they asked Jesus, “Why are you speaking to them in parables?” (Matthew 13:10).\n\nIt’s a funny thought. Why would Jesus want to make things more complicated? Isn’t the kingdom of heaven a sufficiently difficult idea to grasp without riddles? And isn’t it hard enough to comprehend what it means that Jesus is the Messiah, even when explained in plain Aramaic?\n\nYes! And here’s Jesus’s fascinating response, “Because the secrets of the kingdom of heaven have been given for you to know, but it has not been given to them” (v.11). What?! The disciples got secrets that everyone else didn’t get? But wait, there’s more. Jesus continued, “For whoever has, more will be given to him, and he will have more than enough; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. That is why I speak to them in parables, because looking they do not see, and hearing they do not listen or understand” (vv.12–13).\n\nThey think they understand, but they don’t. Now when we read Jesus’s parable of the sower and see the Word fall on unfruitful ground, we can see what He’s talking about. Some hearts are hard, and some hearts are not ready.\n\nChrist’s Word was at the center of His ministry. His Word is valuable—His Word is life—and not everyone understood it. We stand at a wonderful time in history because now we, like His disciples, get to be taken aside to hear Him explain His own Word. The messianic mystery is made even more understandable for us than it was for the disciples because we have access to the entirety of Scripture.\n\nLike the disciples, we need Christ to interpret His Word. Without the illuminating work of the Holy Spirit, we are like those who have eyes yet see not, and have ears yet hear not. Apart from Christ, we are unfit soil and will bear no fruit.\n\nLike the disciples, we are to listen attentively and carefully, seeking to know more. We are not to clutter our hearts with the vain loves and cares of this world. “Therefore, take care how you listen” (Luke 8:18). The light of the world has come to reveal all things, and in His light, nothing remains hidden. So let us look to the Lord and ask Him to give us eyes to see, ears to hear, and hearts to believe (Acts 28:27).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nIn the quiet following the large-scale, miraculous feeding of the five thousand, Jesus asked His disciples, “Who do the crowds say that I am?… Who do you say that I am?” (Luke 9:20).\n\nEveryone had their own version of who Jesus was. Many, like Herod, were curious but perplexed. Others believed Him to be Elijah, a prophet of old, or a resurrected John the Baptist. And I can’t blame them, because even with all the prophecy and typology in the Old Testament, no one had ever seen the Messiah. Jesus as Messiah was a completely new kind of being.\n\nBut good old Peter jumps right in with the correct Sunday-school answer: “God’s Messiah.” Bam! Atta boy, Peter. But even Peter’s confession was revealed to him, not by flesh and blood, but by the heavenly Father (Matthew 16:17). Even Peter needed help sorting out the right answer.\n\nAnd who is God’s Messiah? What does this designation mean? The true Messiah would be the One who would suffer and die for the sins of God’s people, and after three days rise again, though not even Peter had understood that much. The Messiah was not merely one of the prophets, or Elijah, or John. He was the One for whom John prepared the way in the wilderness. We have the advantage of history on our side, knowing that Jesus did suffer, die, and rise again. And we can use that advantage to answer with Peter, “You are God’s Messiah.”\n\nWhat should we do with this information? Right away Jesus follows Peter’s confession with: “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me” (Luke 9:23). Since I don’t have a physical, wooden cross handy, I can’t help but wonder, What does it means to “take up your cross”? Jesus laid aside His glory to bear the cross to Calvary; this was His greatest act of self-denial and obedience to the Father. It is self-denial for the glory of God.\n\nIn the same way, He calls us to set aside our own wills and be fully devoted to the Father’s will. Here’s the sticking point: This is the hardest thing on earth to do. I love doing my own will. It’s my favorite thing. And Jesus specifies that taking up one’s cross is a daily action. With the apostle Paul, our response to the risen Messiah is to die to ourselves daily (1 Corinthians 15:31). So every day, we are called to do the absolute hardest thing in the world—die to ourselves and set aside what we want.\n\nWe’re all like Peter; we can blurt out Sunday-school answers, but the very next minute, we need someone to say to us: “Get behind me Satan!” (Matthew 16:23). We aren’t able to set aside our own will so easily. So how do we take up our cross? We simply take up Christ. We fall at the beautiful feet of the One who has brought us the good news of the gospel (Romans 10:15). We cling to Him, leaning on His perfect righteousness, day after day.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nHave you ever watched kids wait for the bus? Our kids wait at the end of a long driveway, and somehow that distance makes them think they are surely out of my eyeshot. They imagine themselves in a Lord of the Flies world, where no adult can see them, and a child would willingly bludgeon his brother for fruit snacks. They act like the bus stop is a land of limbo where perfect impunity reigns supreme. But our driveway is just not that long.\n\nDrinking my coffee, I watch from the window as my own children frantically blow through a punch list of morning offenses. They are in such a hurry to let it all hang out before they find themselves under the next authority: Miss Pitt, the bus driver. She will brook no nonsense in a moving vehicle. The world is a sinful place, though, and Miss Pitt isn’t always looking in her giant rearview mirror, telling them to sit back down.\n\nMy kids aren’t outliers. We all enjoy the luxury of being out from under authority, to cut loose and do what’s right in our own eyes. And we are the people the Christ came to save. Those of us who are giving noogies, slapping faces, and stealing cookies at the bus stop—those of us who are hiding our shame, returning to our sins, and feeling beaten down by what we’ve done. We are the people Christ came to save. We’re all in the same boat. We’re just better at hiding our misdeeds than children are.\n\nThe day after Jesus’s transfiguration, He came down from the mountain, into the adorable, unwashed fray of regular humans, and He immediately encountered our brokenness. “You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long will I be with you and put up with you?” (Luke 9:41). He knows that we are trying to hide from authority, but this is exactly why He came. He came down from glory to heal a broken world.\n\nEven in the midst of His longing for our redemption, Jesus was about the business of healing, saying to the man in the crowd, “Bring your son here” (v.41). While the crowd and the disciples worried about who was supposed to be able to cast out demons, Christ had fixed His eyes upon the redemption of all things. He knew about the glory of God and was not confused by squirrely, bus-stop shenanigans. He knows that we are broken and full of terrible nonsense, but Jesus understands who He is, who His Father is, and who we are. He is not surprised that we are getting it wrong; that’s literally why He came.\n\nJesus came to save the lost and the broken. He shows forth the glory and greatness of God. Be astonished today, not at the misdeeds of man—that’s not surprising at all—but at the greatness of God’s love and grace for us. His name is great, and He is greatly to be praised (v.43).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI was born in the 1980s—before digital cameras, before text messages or Instagram or any other instantaneous method of sharing photos of newborns existed. My dad used to take pictures of me and physically mail them to his parents. According to family legend, when my grandmother opened the envelope, she would call my dad and ask, “Why did you mail me a baby picture of you?”\n\nMy grandmother kept pictures of her family everywhere, on almost every available square inch of her walls and tables. It was one of my favorite things about her house. Every time we’d visit, we’d look at the baby picture of me next to the baby picture of my dad and marvel at the similarity; I looked exactly like my dad as a baby.\n\nScripture tells us Jesus is the exact expression of God’s nature (Hebrews 1:5). He “is the image of the invisible God,” and all of God’s fullness—all of it!—dwells in Jesus (Colossians 1:15,19). Jesus reveals this to His disciples in Luke 10, giving them a glimpse into His divinity. Jesus was God in the flesh, walking around on earth—fully man, fully God. The invisible God (John 1:18) became visible, flesh and bone, to dwell with His people.\n\nThe technical term for Jesus’s humanity and divinity is the “hypostatic union,” the mystery of His perfect union of God and man. We don’t know how that union works; we only know that it does. Jesus also tells us why the Father it is a mystery: because the Father intended it to be (Luke 10:21).\n\nThe Word became flesh and dwelt among us… we have all received grace upon grace from his fullness… No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and at his father’s side—he has revealed him (John 1:14–18).\n\nJesus came because it was the Father’s good pleasure for the Son to dwell here, to live a fully human life, to stand in our place, and to take the punishment for our sin. Jesus came to reveal the Father’s lavish love and the riches of His grace. This Jesus, who loved sinners and outcasts, who died for His people to satisfy justice and turned over temple tables in perfect, righteous anger, who wept at the death of His friend and washed His disciples’ feet—this is our God incarnate, the full and perfect expression of who our God is. All glory and honor forever be to Him!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI was home alone one evening when someone started knocking at my door. We have a rather unwelcoming “No Solicitation” sign posted on our door, and it was past the time for a postal delivery. And yet, the knocking persisted. Generally, I don’t answer the door when I’m home alone, but I peeked around the corner and saw that it was our friendly neighbor, looking exceptionally apologetic.\n\n“Do you have a corkscrew we could borrow?”\n\nWe did, and I gave it to him, and sincerely told him to knock anytime.\n\nThe parable Jesus tells in today’s reading is about a persistent neighbor, only this one is knocking and knocking and knocking at midnight, after the whole house had already gone to bed. Some commentaries call this parable humorous, a quality we don’t always assign to Jesus’s words, but in this case, the story plays out a bit like a sitcom.\n\nA man and his family are asleep in bed, when a neighbor starts knocking. Eventually, the man gets up, begrudgingly, not out of the kindness in his heart, but because of his friend’s “shameless boldness” (Luke 11:8).\n\nThe point Jesus is making is not that we should be hospitable at all costs, even dragging ourselves out of a warm bed in the middle of the night to give our neighbor some bread. He’s telling us we should approach God with the same shameless boldness of the knocking neighbor in the parable. Some translations call it the neighbor’s “impudence,” or “shameless audacity.” These are not words I typically think of when I pray.\n\nI am learning, however, to be persistent in prayer, praying the same things over and over again—not out of disbelief, but out of belief and faith. Every night, I pray the same words over my daughters: “Please show them how much You love them. Give them hearts that love You, eyes that see You, ears that hear You.” It’s not laziness, but persistence. Over and over, I ask, seek, and knock at God’s door in prayer.\n\nJesus’s illustration of persistent prayer follows the Lord’s Prayer, a tangible example of how we should pray every day. His answer to the disciples’ request, “Teach us to pray,” is two-fold. First, pray for things like these. Second, pray persistently.\n\nYesterday, in Luke 10, we read about how Jesus came to reveal the Father. Today, He shows us how we can speak to the Father. Jesus invites us to know Him. And through Him, we’re invited to know the Father, too, to pray to Him without ceasing.\n\nMay we ask, seek, and knock with persistence and faith, knowing that God will always answer for the good of all those who love Him, and to make known the riches of His glory (Romans 8:28; 9:23).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nMore often than not, there are times when anxiety feels like my closest friend. It greets me in the morning, my heart rate rising with the sun. It follows me to the mirror, to the breakfast table, to the car, to work. It is the shadow I can’t get rid of, an endless churning of guilt and shame and fear in my heart and mind. It’s a disease, a chemical imbalance, a generational struggle.\n\nThis particular passage in Luke features a lot of anxiety, from the revelation that nothing hidden won’t eventually be known, to the fear of death, to the “unforgivable sin,” to Jesus’s famous command not to worry because we are worth more than the wildflowers and the sparrows.\n\nI tend to read Luke 12 as if it’s all about me: what I worry about, what I value, what I should or shouldn’t do. Don’t be like the Pharisees; fear God. Don’t be afraid; acknowledge Jesus as the Christ and don’t deny Him. Don’t blaspheme the Spirit (which is considered the “unforgivable sin,” the denial of Jesus’s work to the point that one considers it to be demonic). Don’t store up treasure for myself. Don’t worry about clothes or food—and on and on.\n\nWhile I do think Jesus is teaching us a lot about ourselves, our worldly impulses, and the things we worry about, He is also revealing much about God, His character, and His work. There are three specific truths I want to rest in today: first, the sovereignty and care of the Father; second, the advocacy of the Son; and finally, the provision of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe Father: In Luke 12:6–7, we see a clear picture of the limitless power and the all-surpassing knowledge that God possesses. Everything hidden will be revealed. This would be terrifying if it weren’t for the next part. Even though everything awful we’ve ever done will made public, our belief in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus makes us clean before God.\n\nThe Son: In verse 8, Jesus tells us that if we acknowledge Him, He will acknowledge us in the presence of God the Father (“before the angels of God” is a reference to God’s presence). He is our advocate in prayer before God, but He is also our advocate for salvation before God, the righteous Judge.\n\nThe Holy Spirit: Verse 12 teaches that the Holy Spirit is our provider, who will give us the words we need to acknowledge Christ when we are persecuted. Jesus promises His followers that the Spirit will give them what they need to continue in faith.\n\nIn a passage known for its treatment of anxiety, Luke assures us that God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit are working together in perfect unity, to care for us in perfect knowledge, perfect advocacy, and perfect provision.\n\nI may battle my anxiety until the day I walk into glory, but the death of my anxiety is assured because of the life of Jesus. The more the book of Luke reveals to me about the beauty of the Son, the closer I feel to the heart of the Father.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nIn Andrew Peterson’s beloved Christmas album Behold the Lamb of God, he sings the song, “Deliver Us,” based on Jesus’s lament for Jerusalem in Luke chapter 13. He sings, hauntingly,\n\nJerusalem, Jerusalem \n\nHow often I have longed\n\nTo gather you beneath my gentle wings.\n\nEven typing these words brings tears to my eyes. Peterson captures, in a way that only master songwriters can, the ache of the ages. The song ends with those lines, an answer to the previous verses that are sung from the perspective of God’s wandering people:\n\nOur sins they are more numerous than all the lambs we slay\n\nOur shackles they were made with our own hands\n\nJesus’s lament summarizes the history of God’s stiff-necked people. Jerusalem—used here both literally, in reference to the city, and also as a metaphor for God’s people throughout time—had a history of turning away from God and abandoning the prophets, judges, and even the Messiah God had sent to them. Even earlier in this chapter, we see a specific example of the Pharisees questioning Jesus’s miracles. The crowds believed, but the leaders rejected Him.\n\nDespite the innumerable sins of His people and their continuing self-imprisonment due to their own choices, Jesus weeps over the city and the people He came to save (Luke 19:41). God longs to gather His children, to protect them, to gather them under His wings (Psalm 91:4). Jerusalem is His greatest joy (Psalm 137:6), the people He will go to the greatest lengths to save. It is the promise of the whole of Scripture.\n\nJesus stands outside of the city where He will die, and His lament is not for His death. His lament is for the people He longs to save. He has just finished warning them, telling them that by not believing Him they will not join Him in the kingdom of God. But His lament shows us that He does not make these proclamations about the narrow way out of anger, but out of grief.\n\n“How often I wanted to gather your children together…\n\nbut you were not willing!” (v.34).\n\nEven in His lament over the past and current rejection of His people, Jesus knew He would be rejected yet again in Jerusalem. But the steadfast, faithful, persistent love of the Father through the ages, embodied in the person of Christ, never fails. Love would carry Jesus all the way to the cross, into the dark tomb, and ultimately, into the glorious resurrection—where He invites us to join Him, forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI am uncomfortable writing about pride and humility, precisely because I have too much of one and not nearly enough of the other. I dare say I’m not alone, either. I did a little bit of cultural research when I started writing this, because I wanted to see how other people talk about humility.\n\nFirst, I found a series of business articles in prominent journals about how humility is the secret to good leadership—including an article literally titled, “17 Reasons Humility Will Help You Get Ahead.” Later, I found an article about the power dynamics of choosing your seat in a business meeting, and research about the psychology behind your choice.\n\nWhat Jesus says in Luke 14:7–14 is exactly the opposite: “But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place” (v.10). When He tells this parable, Jesus isn’t teaching a large crowd. He is eating a Sabbath meal in the house of Pharisees, the group that would be largely responsible for later placing Him on trial.\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus confronts the Pharisees three times. First, He heals a man on the Sabbath, an issue over which the Pharisees had previously confronted Him. Second, having observed the Pharisees carefully choosing their seats at the Sabbath meal, He tells a parable about being humble and always choosing the worst seat. Third, He tells another parable about a wedding feast where none of the invited guests come, so the host extends the invitation to the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.\n\nThroughout Luke, we see Jesus inaugurating the kingdom of God and proclaiming its values. He challenges the Pharisees, and He challenges our hearts. The parables He tells are for His immediate audience, but they are also for us, showing us the way life should work in His kingdom. And in the kingdom of God, humility isn’t a tactic to get ahead. It’s not a carefully-calculated decision about where to sit in a meeting, or at a party.\n\nIn his book, The Freedom of Self-Forgetfulness, Tim Keller writes:\n\nGospel-humility is not needing to think about myself. Not needing to connect things with myself. It is an end to thoughts such as, ‘I’m in this room with these people, does that make me look good? Do I want to be here?’ True gospel-humility means I stop connecting every experience, every conversation, with myself. In fact, I stop thinking about myself. The freedom of self-forgetfulness. The blessed rest that only self-forgetfulness brings.\n\nI’ll pray through those words today, asking for self-forgetfulness and gospel-humility, asking for the Spirit to convict me when I put people and things before Jesus, and praying, inspired by the words of Paul in Romans, “Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud; instead, associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own estimation” (v.16).\n\n",

For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our message? 17 So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the message about Christ.\n\nRomans 10:14–17\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Lost and Found",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nIf you’re fortunate, it’s been long enough since you’ve experienced being lost, that you’ve forgotten the sheer terror of it. Dig into your memories and find yourself there again, tucked into a clothing rack at a department store, searching for signs of your mama, or wandering through an unfamiliar city without your GPS, and allow yourself to feel it anew. The sweaty palms, the dry mouth, the disorientation that comes from not knowing which direction to go, the desperation to find yourself safely tucked back into the arms of the familiar.\n\nWe can’t fault the Pharisees and scribes, not really. They saw Jesus breaking bread with the “lost,” and they forgot, bless them, how remarkable it is to be found. “And the Pharisees and scribes were complaining, ‘This man welcomes sinners and eats with them’” (Luke 15:2). And so Jesus lays out a series of lessons.\n\nHe starts with sheep, a relatively disposable commodity. As a sheep farmer myself, I can say with certainty that the flock matters, as do the individual hooves and horns that make it up, but a lost sheep or two is relatively minor. That is, unless you’re the Good Shepherd… or that one sheep who’s wandered off.\n\nAs the religious leaders listened to Jesus, perhaps they counted themselves among the ninety-nine, safe in the pen of rules and right thinking. And yet, whether in the pen or gone astray, the Good Shepherd deeply loves His sheep, all of them. Pay attention to the numbers in this first scene. The ratio of lost to found is one to ninety-nine, but Jesus is about to raise the stakes.\n\nConsider a woman with ten silver coins. One slips through her fingers. It’s lost but not forgotten. She searches earnestly until the coin is in her hands. In Jesus’s second story, the ratio of lost to found is one to nine. Perhaps the Pharisees were still stifling a yawn at this point. Who cares about a single straggling sheep or even a single roll-away coin? When it comes to livestock and treasure, value is all relative.\n\nBut what about a son? Would we disregard a lost son carelessly? A loving parent would exhaust every resource to bring their lost boy home. The ratio here is intimate. One boy at home and one gone astray, one obedient and one in rebellion. Each time the Lord teaches the principle, the margins narrow. Heaven can never become so full of the saved that the Lord will cease to care about the lost.\n\nThose who bear His image are not cattle to Him. He doesn’t think of us like pennies, barely worth being picked up off the sidewalk. We are His beloved children, the apple of His eye (Psalm 17:8). At the cross, He proved He would pay any ransom for us, even if we were the only one lost in the darkness of sin. What the Pharisees didn’t see was that Jesus wasn’t just eating a meal with the lost. He was searching for lost sheep, seeking missing treasure, and running to meet His beloved sons and daughters.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nWe tend to pluck out Christ’s teachings and deliver them as neat and tidy Sunday school lessons. Every word is true and useful (Proverbs 30:5; 2 Timothy 3:16), and yet, when we place ourselves in the sandals of the original hearers and listen as they would have listened, we discover a depth we might otherwise miss.\n\nLet’s use Luke 16 as our case study for this principle. Luke 15 sets the scene. A crowd of tax collectors and sinners had gathered around Jesus, annoyed that “this man receives sinners and eats with them” (v.2). The nerve! Jesus addressed their unrighteous indignation with a string of vivid lessons. If we were watching this text unfold as a theatre performance, our program might read something like this:\n\nScene 1: A sheep, a coin, and a son—three stories about the lost.\n\nThe curtains would then fall and rise again to…\n\nScene 2: A swindler, a beggar, and a rich man—two stories about true riches.\n\nChrist’s words, “One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much” (Luke 16:10, ESV), are scribbled into the bottom of my laundry baskets as a reminder that if Jesus can’t trust me to do laundry well and with joy, He surely can’t trust me with something more significant. Laundry aside, this is the point Jesus makes in the parable of the dishonest manager. Though at first glance it might seem Jesus holds up the manager’s swindling as model behavior, it’s not the dishonesty Jesus wants us to emulate; it’s that he views money as a means to an end. So should followers of Jesus; the accumulation of wealth should never be our goal, but if we can use earthly wealth for eternal good, we will prove ourselves faithful. “So if you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will trust you with what is genuine?” (v.11, CSB).\n\nFast forward a few verses. Jesus is still responding to the hard-hearted Pharisees (vv.14–15) when He tells the tale of a rich man and a beggar named Lazarus. Lazarus dies and is in glory; the rich man dies and is in torment. After the rich man pleads for Lazarus to go to his relatives and call them to repent, the lesson ends with these words: “If they don’t hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead” (v.31). God’s Word has been beating the same drum since the beginning: wealth might make things easier in this life, but it’s not what matters for the next. End scene.\n\nJesus was talking to people who valued wealth and saw it as a sign of God’s favor, but He reminds them that the kingdom doesn’t have quite the same economy. The faith of a child—not money or possessions—is all that’s needed. Money is alluring, but it is a master who ultimately disappoints. God looks at our hearts, not our bank account statements. “And he told them, ‘You are the ones who justify yourselves in the sight of others, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly admired by people is revolting in God’s sight’” (v.15).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nI’ve sung the hymn “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing” nearly every night for the past decade. It’s the lullaby I sing over my children as I put them to sleep. I’ve spent thousands of hours rocking a swaddled cherub in my arms and softly singing these words:\n\nCome, Thou Fount of every blessing\n\nTune my heart to sing Thy grace\n\nStreams of mercy, never ceasing\n\nCall for songs of loudest praise\n\nI mean it. Deep down in my gut, I swear I do. And yet, in the light of day, when life is hard, my heart doesn’t turn toward praise quite so easily. The Lord described us perfectly when He said, “They always go astray in their heart; they have not known my ways” (Hebrews 3:10). There’s no sense in trying to sugarcoat it.\n\nThe prophet Isaiah declared, “We all went astray like sheep; we all have turned to our own way” (Isaiah 53:6). It’s why Robert Robinson, writer of the hymn I mentioned above, included these words, “Prone to wander, Lord I feel it. Prone to leave the God I love…” And why I sing them to my babes, knowing they inherited their wandering hearts from me. I’m so prone to wander toward fear, doubt, and worry, instead of trusting that God will come through. If the measure of my blessings hinged on the amount of my faith, I’d have to go without.\n\nFaith is the only gift we have to offer the Lord. It’s what the Samaritan leper brought Jesus in Luke 17, and it was enough. “And he told him, ‘Get up and go on your way. Your faith has saved you’” (v.19). But unlike faith, the grace of God isn’t measured in mustard seeds. The “streams of mercy” we sing about are more like a tidal wave, capable of washing away our sin and guilt (Zechariah 13:1), even when our faith is frail.\n\nPerhaps the reason I’m so comforted by the words of Come Thou Fount, is because of a story I once heard about its songwriter. As it goes, one day Robinson was riding in a stagecoach when a lady asked him his thoughts on the hymn she’d been humming. Robinson reportedly replied, “Madam, I am the poor unhappy man who wrote that hymn many years ago, and I would give a thousand worlds, if I had them, to enjoy the feelings I had then.”\n\nI’m so grateful for and encouraged by the disciples’ request of Jesus, found in Luke chapter 17. They asked, “Increase our faith!” (v.5). Their words remind me of the tender prayer of a father desperate to see Jesus heal his boy found in Mark 9:24, “I do believe; help my unbelief!”\n\nProne to wander. Lord, I feel it. And yet, we serve a God who is relentless in pursuit of us (Luke 15:4). Whether you have faith the size of a mountain or a speck today, you can wrap yourself up tightly and rest in this:\n\nJesus sought me when a stranger\n\nWandering from the fold of God\n\nHe, to rescue me from danger\n\nInterposed His precious blood\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nIn my high school youth group, we used to play a game I loved. The game was Bigger or Better, and the object was simple: keep trading up for the biggest or best prize. To start, we were divided into teams and each team was given a single paper clip. We were then unleashed on a neighborhood with a simple assignment: “Come back with something bigger and better than this.” We’d go house to house, making trades. At first, we’d trade in the paperclip for something smallish, like a cup or dish. We’d trade that in for something bigger… say, a basketball or framed piece of art. And on and on we’d go, until we were called back together to display our spoils.\n\nTrading up is always a thrill. This is the message the rich ruler seemed to miss during his encounter with Jesus. He had his eyes on the prize of eternal life, but he misunderstood the path to getting there. Though he recognized Jesus as a “good teacher,” he missed God’s heart. This ruler was a good child who turned into a good man, and he wanted assurance that he was good enough.\n\nJesus rattled off a few of the ten commandments: “Do not commit adultery; do not murder; do not steal; do not bear false witness; honor your father and mother” (Luke 18:20). To which the man had the audacity to respond, “I have kept all these from my youth” (v.21). But even if this man had been perfectly obedient with these commandments, keeping the letter of the law is not the same as following the heart of the God behind that law.\n\nJesus offered him a trade up.\n\nInstead of keeping all the rules, the man could sell all his belongings. You see, Jesus knew that despite his outward obedience, the rich young ruler was missing out. His money was in the way. Rather than asking the man to make a tremendous sacrifice—another religious task—Jesus was really offering the man his freedom. But it does not always appear that way to those of us who hear such offers. No wonder the crowds declared, “Then who can be saved?” (v.26).\n\nJesus’s response: “What is impossible with man is possible with God” (v.27).\n\nGo on, bring to the Lord whatever you hope will save you. Bring your good works and best days. Bring your charity and church membership. Bring your idyllic childhood and productive adulthood. And trade them in. He may not ask you to sell everything and give the proceeds to the poor, but He will ask you to part with anything in your life that’s keeping you from knowing the love of God.\n\nAccept Christ’s invitation to lay down your goodness for something better. It’s a trade up.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nOne of the great riddles of being human is what to do with all the waiting.\n\nWe wait for the seasons to change.\n\nWe wait for our hurts to heal.\n\nWe wait for our children to grow up… then wait for them to return home.\n\nWe’re all waiting for something, and as my favorite rocker, the late Tom Petty, liked to remind us, “The waiting is the hardest part.”\n\nPay close attention to what’s happening in Luke 19, and you’ll see that while Christ’s followers were celebrating His triumphal entry into Jerusalem, they were waiting too. Verse 11 reveals, “As they were listening to this, he went on to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem, and they thought the kingdom of God was going to appear right away” (emphasis mine).\n\nThe crowds were following Jesus, expecting Him to bring an end to their waiting. They thought He would enter Jerusalem, exile the government that had been oppressing them, and establish the glorious kingdom He’d been telling them about. This is the moment, they must have thought, when all the waiting—for freedom, for peace, for victory—will surely pay off. \n\nBut Jesus wasn’t about to stage a coup. He was marching toward the cross. The crowd’s hopes and dreams for the establishment of Christ’s kingdom on earth would have to wait. (At least for the kingdom the way they had expected it).\n\nFast-forward to today. You’re still waiting too. So am I. We want to see God move in our lives. We want to watch Him come in power and abolish everything that causes us pain. Instead of wringing our hands and pacing the floor, what can we do while we wait?\n\n“The whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen” (v.37). Though at this point the crowds still assumed Jesus was going to lead a military victory, they were right to rejoice over what they had already seen in anticipation of what was still to come.\n\nThe greatest indicator of what Christ will do is what He has already done. In every season of waiting we can join with the “multitude” of saints in declaring the victories He’s already given. The disciples had no way of knowing they were watching a preview of a future celebration of Christ’s triumph, when He will one day return in glory:\n\n“Then I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse. Its rider is called Faithful and True, and he judges and makes war with justice… The armies that were in heaven followed him on white horses, wearing pure white linen… And he has a name written on his robe and on his thigh: King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Revelation 19:11,14,16).\n\nCelebrate every promise you’ve seen Him fulfill, every victory He’s ever secured, every blessing He’s every poured out. They are the down payment for the moment when all of our longings will be fulfilled. May we worship while we wait.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nPatrick and I sat in a tasting room with ten strangers, drinking wine from delicate glasses. Before us, an expanse of windows revealed a golden hillside. Our host raised a bottle of cabernet and smiled. As he poured the red wine, he told us about the vineyard’s renowned owner, John Shafer, a man who, in 1972 had left a successful banking career in Chicago to purchase farmland in California. A pioneer in American winemaking, John Shafer’s wines helped put Napa Valley on the map.\n\nEnraptured by the tale and tastes, I almost didn’t hear the door open behind me. Turning, I saw an elderly man walk in, using a cane. Wrinkled but smiling, he had blue eyes and a faint suggestion of hair on top of his head.\n\n“Well, here he is,” the tasting host said, standing quickly from the table. “This is John.”\n\nI could tell from the flabbergasted look on our host’s face, that this was no normal drop in. At ninety-two years old, the vineyard owner rarely made appearances. For decades, he’d put in the hard work of tending grapes. Now, he trusted his sons and staff to maintain his legacy. As I stared at John Shafer’s face, I felt like I was in the presence of royalty. In his presence, I cared a lot less about the wine and a lot more about the man who’d made it.\n\nThroughout Scripture, a “vineyard” is used as a metaphor for the nation of Israel. In Luke 20, the crowd listening to Jesus’s parable would have recognized that symbol. With this story, Jesus proclaimed that if the Israelites rejected Jesus, the promises and inheritance of God would go to new owners. In other words, God was about to offer His grace, kindness, and salvation to the Gentiles. The chief priests, scribes, and elders reacted quickly, shouting, “That must never happen!” (v.16).\n\nImagine if John Shafer had turned to me, and right there in front of his employee, said, “Claire, I’d like you to take over the day-to-day operations of this place.” Consider if he’d smiled, raised a hand, and pointed to the land outside those shining windows. “The whole thing is under your management.” Do you think his employee would have raised a toast? Not likely. Instead, they would have thought the owner had gone mad.\n\nFor millennia, Jews held claim to the exclusive privileges of being God’s people. They couldn’t believe those blessings could extend to anyone else. Jesus’s presence, His kindness to Samaritans and women and disabled people, His claims to be the Son of God—threatened everything the Pharisees held to be true. They were in the presence of the vineyard owner, and yet they refused to release their death grip on the grapes. They couldn’t see the person because their eyes couldn’t look past their own power.\n\nIf I felt awed by the presence of John Shafer in a tasting room, how much more should I be in awe of Jesus, who hands me the keys to His kingdom? It’s a kindness so kind, it might be seen as irresponsible. He has given us an inheritance that is “imperishable, undefiled, and unfading” (1 Peter 1:4). Some may reject Him, but to all who receive Him, Jesus gives the right to become children of God (John 1:12).\n\nHe steps forward, points to the vineyard, and says, “My beloved sister, enjoy.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nOne of the great perks of being a novelist is the research. Recently, for reasons that are not fully apparent to me, I’ve been devouring anything I can read about Italian orphanages during and after WWII. I’ve even connected with an eighty-year old Neapolitan man through Facebook. Through Google translate, he’s shared about his experience growing up under the care of a Christian family, the Santis, who ran the only Protestant orphanage in Southern Italy, a place called Casa Materna.\n\nThough Casa Materna is now closed, I immediately ordered every book on Amazon about the place. In reading about the Santi family during WWII, I was struck by one situation in particular. Under constant surveillance by Mussolini’s fascist spies, Papa Santi, the founder of Casa Materna, was arrested for his activities and his preaching. At the trial, the judge asked him what he preached every Sunday at the orphanage. In response, Papa Santi began reading directly from the New Testament! His unjust persecution turned into an opportunity for unparalleled witness.\n\nFrom my position of safety and wealth, WWII might seem like ancient history. But I am really just two generations removed from that reality—a reality that may have looked a lot like Jesus’s prediction of the end of the age.\n\nJesus doesn’t sugarcoat the truth for His disciples. He explains that the future is going to be full of war, famine, plagues, and natural disasters. He describes the destruction of the temple, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the persecution of believers. It is a picture of great chaos. And yet! In the midst of that chaos, His followers are to stand firm and lift their heads.\n\nMuch like Papa Santi in the midst of the chaos of WWII, Jesus’s followers are not to be distracted by the chaos of the kingdoms of the world, but to keep their eyes focused on the kingdom that is coming, one that cannot be shaken. Jesus is our only hope, our only comfort. Despite the chaos of the world, He will still come back. The Son of Man will not leave us as orphans. He will come with power and great glory. He is coming back to rescue us. It is a certainty. He promises, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away” (Luke 21:33).\n\nWe shouldn’t expect our future to look much different from what Papa Santi faced in his lifetime. But what Jesus told His disciples is still true for us. We do not need to prepare our defense against the world; we need only to draw close to the Defender.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nWhen I was a freshman in college, I grew in my faith like never before. I became captivated by the gospel, thirsty for truth, and passionate about Jesus. It was one of the sweetest and most vibrant chapters of my faith, but this explosive growth was accompanied by one negative consequence: self-righteousness.\n\nWith my newfound convictions, I felt strongly about the way things should be done, and the way things should not be done. When I went home on breaks, I lectured my parents about our home church and the things that needed to change. I pronounced harsh judgments on friends who were not following Jesus. I frowned disapprovingly when my boyfriend’s parents drank wine with their dinner. I was, in a word, insufferable.\n\nThankfully, my parents were patient and wise. They listened and gently challenged some of my thinking, but they also recognized I was young and in need of shepherding. In contrast with my demeanor, they showed grace.\n\nI will never forget that season of my life, when my love for Jesus resulted in some very un-Jesus-like behavior. I will forever be humbled by it, because it continues to remind me of the truth that human brokenness and sin runs deep, perverting even our noblest intentions.\n\nIn Luke 22, this aspect of sin is on full display. First we have the chief priests, who oversee Jesus’s arrest. In his commentary, The Gospel of Luke, New Testament scholar Joel B. Green explains that these religious leaders “believe themselves to be serving God, yet unwittingly serve a diabolical aim.” Then, we have a disciple who, in his desperation to defend his teacher, draws his sword and cuts off the ear of a chief priest’s servant. Swiftly and sharply, Jesus condemns this violence (v.51).\n\nWithin this scene we see two different types of people who are trying to honor God and doing just the opposite instead. How can we avoid doing the same?\n\nFirst, we must admit that we will inevitably do the same, because we are human. The same brokenness that runs through the high priests, and the same brokenness that runs through the disciple (Peter, according to the parallel account in John 18) also runs through us. We will get it wrong, and that is precisely why we need a Savior. Even our best efforts can become mangled by sin. That said, the Lord’s Table—which sits at the center of this chapter—is a compass of sorts.\n\n“And he took bread, gave thanks, broke it, gave it to them, and said,\n\n‘This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me’” (Luke 22:19).\n\nWhen Jesus instructs His disciples to remember, He is not only talking about His death. He is also talking about the example He set throughout His life. Jesus is the Savior who does not need weapons or worldly power to achieve His means. Jesus transformed the entire world by humbling Himself and laying Himself down—first in a manger, and then on a cross—and this is the standard to which we are held. This is how we preach Christ, without opposing Him in the process.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nOn September 11, 1934, theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote the following words in a letter to a friend:\n\n“We must finally stop appealing to theology to justify our reserved silence about what the state is doing—for that is nothing but fear. ‘Open your mouth for the one who is voiceless’—for who in the church today still remembers that that is the least of the Bible’s demands in times such as these?”\n\nBonhoeffer penned this plea as the Nazi regime was gaining power, the death toll was growing, and many of his fellow Christians remained silent. He watched in horror as the German church failed to speak up and do what was right, choosing instead the false innocence of silence.\n\nEighty-five years later, it is easy to look back and judge. It’s easy to wonder how Christians in Germany failed so miserably. And yet, to do so is to deny one of the most common tactics of sin: shifting blame.\n\nBlame-shifting is a thread that runs throughout Jesus’s trial in Luke 23. Pilate knows Jesus is innocent, and he does not want to execute him, and so he hands Jesus off to Herod (v.7). Herod, in turn, sends Jesus back to Pilate (v.11). Pilate then appeals to Jesus’s accusers, suggesting that a lesser punishment would be appropriate (v.16–20). But the crowds are unsatisfied. They will settle for nothing less than the death penalty. For a third time, Pilate pleads with the crowd to be reasonable (v.22), but they will not be dissuaded. Finally, Pilate finally hands Jesus over to them.\n\nIt would have been easy for Pilate to blame the crowd for Jesus’s fate. After all, he spoke up—multiple times!—but they insisted. What more could he have done? It also would have been easy for Herod to blame Pilate. After all, he didn’t kill the man. He simply handed him over to someone else.\n\nThis is what sin does. It shifts blame while insisting on its own innocence: So long as I wasn’t the one nailing Jesus to the cross, or rounding up my Jewish neighbors, or leading the lynch mob—I am innocent.\n\nHowever, when we read the story of Pilate, we are reminded that God holds us to a far higher standard. The story of Pilate chastens us with the truth that a holiness built on omission, inaction, and looking the other way is no holiness at all.\n\nIn Stuart Townend’s famous hymn, “How Deep the Father’s Love for Us,” he describes the events of Luke 23 this way:\n\nBehold the man upon a cross,\n\nMy sin upon His shoulders;\n\nAshamed, I hear my mocking voice\n\nCall out among the scoffers.\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine mocking our beloved Jesus. It’s nearly impossible to envision a time when we might look into His heartbroken eyes and jeer, impossible to imagine that we might be included among those for whom He prayed, saying, “Father, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing” (v.34). But the tragic story of Pilate reminds us that sometimes the loudest act of abandonment is choosing to say nothing at all.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nThis year, my husband and I started a church, and in many ways it has been the most amazing adventure of our lives. We have seen signs and wonders, answers to prayer, supernatural provision, and the fruition of God-given vision. My husband and I have been awed and amazed, and truly, we will never be the same.\n\nAnd yet…\n\nAll along, during these months of amazement, I have noticed something funny in my soul. Call it an “inability to digest.” I have seen the miraculous with my own two eyes. I have experienced it, and I have lived it. And still, a part of me wonders, Really? Did that really happen? It’s as if my faith cannot catch up. No matter what God does, no matter how powerful and unforgettable, my brain struggles to wrap itself around the truth.\n\nThis is the dilemma of being a finite human being who worships an infinite God. As long as we live on this earth, we will struggle to grasp the ways of God. We observe this struggle in Luke 24. First, there are Jesus’s closest female companions, who have followed Him and supported Him all the way. By this point, they should have “gotten it,” yet when they see the empty tomb, they still have to be asked, “Why are you looking for the living among the dead?” (v.5). Then, in verses 36–37, when Jesus appears to the disciples, they assume they are seeing a ghost. Even after studying His hands and feet, they were still wrestling with disbelief (v.41).\n\nWhat this tells us is that faith is much harder than we often like to admit, and we see this theme woven throughout the Gospels. Over and over, Jesus’s followers fail to understand Him, and they struggle to believe. Whether it’s Jesus’s purpose, identity, or plan they’re misunderstanding at any given moment, they are consistently unable to keep up. Their faith never does keep pace with all that Jesus is doing.\n\nAnd I get it. This year, I have found myself in that place again and again, fumbling for a faith that matches the magnitude of all that God is doing around me. It’s humbling and convicting.\n\nThankfully, the good news of Jesus Christ does not rise and fall on the size of our faith. If that were the case, Jesus’s disciples would not have accomplished very much. Instead, the gospel of Jesus Christ rises and falls on the reality of His life, death, resurrection, none of which is strengthened or diminished by our ability to fully comprehend it.\n\nThis is the grace we have in Christ. Our faith will never match the size of His works. Our belief will never catch up to all that He is doing. But the story of Luke is the story of God using imperfect people with imperfect faith to accomplish Christ’s mission in the world. All that God requires is a willing heart—willing to try, and willing to fail—trusting Him to redeem the whole of it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: John 1:1-50, Genesis 1:1-5, Isaiah 55:10-11, Hebrews 1:1-4\n\nGathered around the living room, we remained seated as the doorbell continued to ring. We didn’t need another casserole or vase of sympathy flowers; we needed words. \n\nVoid of compassion, the blank document—an unforeseen obituary—stared back at us, wringing all adjectives of their meaning, one after another. Each suggested description seemed to shrink our beloved boy, the one who held the titles of both my best friend and my younger brother, into someone foreign and unrecognizable. The task of fitting all of his life and all of our love into one small newspaper column was exhausting, so we traded our pencils for pillows and gave up for the night. \n\nA few hours later, unable to sleep, I rolled over to see a small beam of light coming from downstairs, and decided to follow it. I found my sleepy-eyed father furiously scribbling notes on a stack of white index cards. Between the light blue lines were favorite stories, memorable quotes, and beloved quirks. My dad handed me a stack, and as the dark sky faded into morning, our collection of cards finally created the outline of something familiar—someone familiar. \n\nI imagine the Apostle John sitting down to translate the encounters he’d had with Jesus into suitable words. To him, Jesus was not a faraway character, but a trusted friend and beloved Savior. Writing these words, this Gospel account, John probably recalled intimate details about Jesus—the way He smelled, what His favorite foods were, the sound of His laugh. He could clearly call to mind the expressions his friend made when feeling tired or excited or somber. Yet, John undertook the task of assembling words to describe the heaven-sent Son of God to those of us who didn’t know Jesus in the flesh.\n\nJohn must have had a wealth of stories to choose from when deciding how to open his eyewitness account. But, through the Holy Spirit’s inspiration, this dear friend of Jesus begins his narrative with the thing that identified Jesus most: \n\n“In the beginning was the Word,\n\nand the Word was with God,\n\nand the Word was God.”\n\n– John 1:1\n\nAfter years of witnessing Jesus’ parables, miracles, and interactions firsthand, John presents Jesus as the Word—a tangible love letter from God. Jesus did not come to merely deliver a message from God—He Himself is the message. \n\n“The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.”\n\n– John 1:14\n\nThe Apostle John’s words are not only the beginning to another chapter in the Bible; they are the beginning to understanding who Jesus is. He is our promised Savior. He is the one who has been with God from the beginning. He is the Word.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nText: John 2:1-25, Psalm 104:14-15, 1 Peter 4:11\n\nI have always wondered why Jesus gave permission to not believe on account of Himself alone. After all, wasn’t it He, who claimed to be the way, the truth, and the life? That no man comes to the Father except through the Son? (John 14:6). Why then, did Jesus Himself say, “If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me; but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works” (John 10:37,38). Even if, Jesus said. Even if you cannot believe His words, believe the works of His hand.\n\nPastor and author Tim Keller calls Jesus the Lord of the wine, the feast, the party, and basically, the greatest time ever. We know this because His very first miracle—the first work of His man hands—was the turning of water into wine. Nay, the best wine. And the disciples marveled, John tells us; they believed in Him (John 2:11). It was because of a miracle that His disciples believed in Him, and it was on account of His miracles that many came to Him. \n\nI find it hard to trust sometimes. Don’t you? It seems sometimes that God is intricately interested in the plans and futures of so many others, while He feels far off from me. His presence feels not as near and His words sound not as bright. I find it hard to believe Him in those moments. It’s much easier to believe the God who answers my prayers, clears my ways, and makes straight my paths. It’s easier to believe the God who is there. \n\nI think Jesus knew this. In our common vernacular, I imagine His words sounded something like this: “If you cannot believe me (even though I’m doing these works right in front of you), can’t you believe on the evidence of me?” \n\nI don’t know whether Jesus was disappointed with the people for being incredulous at what played out in front of their eyes, in their skepticism and doubt. But sometimes, when God feels far from me, I remember the glory of Jesus and imagine these words to be more tender than perhaps He meant them. I imagine He knows to believe is hard enough, and even harder when our hearts have grown hard and our hearing dull, and this is why He worked miracles during His short time on earth. He wanted so deeply for the people to believe and see and understand and come and follow Him. \n\nRecently, at Christmas, we celebrated the coming of God to earth not only as man, but as baby. That baby grew into a man, changed water to wine, healed blind eyes, raised the dead, commanded the storm to be silent, and then He died an unjust and brutal death. But this can never be the end of our gospel story, because the most miraculous event comes after: His own resurrection and the proffered gift to us of eternity with Him. Jesus is one long succession of miracles, from birth until death and then life again. His glory is on display from the beginning of time until now, this very second, even in my doubt and my struggle with belief.\n\nI know so many of us struggle to believe with all our hearts that all Jesus’ words and love are true. But do you see His miracles? He didn’t do them for the healed, calmed, and raised alone. He did them for you and for me, and for all humanity. His best glory is the belief of His children.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: John 3:1-36, Ezekiel 36:25-27, 1 Timothy 2:5-6\n\nJohn 3:16 wins the prize for the most well-worn verse in the Bible. Scribbled on bathroom stalls, held high on signs at basketball games, or added to the gear of NFL quarterbacks, John 3:16 is seemingly everywhere. When things become familiar, they sometimes lose their ability to “wow” us. But we still need John 3:16.\n\nIn John 3, we find Jesus in a clandestine conversation with Nicodemus, a Pharisee and influential Jew (v. 1). Nicodemus was trying to wrap his well-educated, powerful brain around the fact that the Savior of His people didn’t look like, act like, or teach like Nicodemus thought he should. What Nicodemus was really wrestling with was the gospel. \n\nI’ve always had a soft spot for Nicodemus, probably because I’ve stepped into the ring and gone a few rounds with the gospel myself. There is a tiny corner of my mind and heart that gets it: I am a sinner, deserving of eternal separation from a holy God. Through His death on the cross, Jesus paid the penalty for my sin and made a way for me to be reconciled to the Father (Romans 6:23). But I struggle to convince my whole self that the gospel can be this simple. \n\nSurely, I need a lot of good works to save me.\n\nI mess up so often, God must have changed His mind about me.\n\nMaybe if I run myself ragged, involving myself in every possible ministry, I will please God.\n\nThese are the things I tell myself nearly as often as John 3:16 shows up on the side of a semi-truck. It’s what we see when we read between the lines when Nicodemus said to Jesus, “But how can anyone be born when he is old?. . . Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born?” (John 3:4). \n\nA few short verses later, we see Nicodemus finally collide with gospel truth: \n\n“For God so loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.”\n\n– John 3:16\n\nThis is so good! Let’s keep reading: \n\n“For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.”\n\n– John 3:17\n\nWhen I try to create a list of requirements for my salvation, I do so out of fear and forgetfulness—like Nicodemus. I’m fearful of being punished and forgetful of God’s character. But God loves us so much! That’s why He sent Jesus here—not to condemn us but to save us. His perfect plan for salvation is laid out for us in John 3:16-17. \n\nMay these words from our Savior never grow stale in hearts and minds, and may we never grow tired of hearing them.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: John 4:1-54, Isaiah 55:1-3\n\nI wonder if she spotted Him from a distance, a man sitting at the well alone—her well, the one she visited daily. I wonder if, as she drew closer, she could make out Jesus’ face and recognize His nationality. A man—a Jewish man—sitting at her well?\n\nShe approached, probably confused. Maybe even a bit afraid. Then, Jesus spoke to her.\n\nIn this story from John 4, Jesus broke through at least three cultural and social barriers of His time:\n\n1. He spoke to a woman, and traditionally, Jewish men were not to be seen conversing with women.\n\n2. He spoke to a Samaritan, and as the Scripture says, Jews had no dealings with Samaritans at the time (v. 9).\n\n3. He spoke to a woman He knew was an “adulteress”—a woman who had more than one husband and was with a man she wasn’t married to.\n\nYet, Jesus spoke to her. A woman. A Samaritan. A sinner.\n\nAnd He didn’t just say hello. Over the course of their brief and profound conversation, He offered her the gift of a lifetime: living water, eternal life. “But whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty again,” Jesus said to her (v. 14).\n\n“Sir,” she said, “give me this water, so that I won’t get thirsty and come here to draw water” (v. 15). \n\nThere she was, standing beside the Messiah in the flesh, and she didn’t fully understand what He was telling her. She took His offer of living water literally. She didn’t get it—not yet.\n\nI love this part so much because it paints such a real and beautiful picture of grace. You don’t have to fully “get it” to receive it.\n\nThat part is hard for me, a lifelong Christ follower, to accept. Unlike the Samaritan woman, I have the knowledge. I like to think that I know Jesus and His story, that I know the right answers and theology. But this story says the gift of Christ is for anyone who wants to receive it—no matter how little you know, how little you have been taught, or how wayward you have lived. Grace reminds us how level the playing field is. \n\nThe Samaritan woman wanted what Jesus offered. She knew this if she knew nothing else. “Give me this water,” she said. And that’s all she had to say.\n\nThat’s all we have to say, too. From the woman frantically checking all her Bible-study boxes to the woman buried under the weight of past sin and shame, this promise is for all of us. Because we’re all thirsty. We’re all weary. We are all desperate for the Jesus who stands at the well offering the exact and only thing we need.\n\nGive me this water, we say, breathless and tired. And He does.\n\n \n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kim Cash Tate\n\nText: John 5:1-47, Exodus 20:8-11, Luke 6:5, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18\n\nI’ll never forget the day I sat down to study my Bible and discovered my toddler had beaten me to the pages. Scribble marks adorned two chapters in Luke—big loopy scribbles in permanent blue ink. “Oh, no!” reverberated within. This was my favorite Bible, the one I spent time with daily over a hot cup of coffee. I was learning to do inductive study with this Bible and marking key words with care. I’d cringe if I had to erase a bit of colored pencil, knowing it wouldn’t be clean. But this was more than a smudged word. Two entire pages had been ruined.\n\nI sat my little girl on my lap to explain gently that she couldn’t color in mommy’s Bible. She’d meant no harm, of course, but this was a teachable moment. She simply couldn’t go around taking pen to paper in books around the house.\n\nBut in that moment the Lord graciously spoke to my heart. My daughter hadn’t taken a pen to any other books, only this book. She was modeling what she’d seen.   \n\n“Sweetie, were you ‘studying’ like Mommy?”\n\nShe smiled, nodding her head big.\n\nIt became my teachable moment. Instead of focusing on “the rules” or my own angst over the pages, I could see the bigger picture. God had been moving in my little girl’s heart, drawing her to His Word. She wanted to interact with it in the only way she knew how. Lifting my focus helped me to see God at work, which changed everything.\n\nIt’s often easy to miss God’s hand at work, just as many did when Jesus walked the earth. I’m astounded when I read of the man Jesus healed by the pool of Bethesda, because of the scene afterward. People had seen this man laying around for thirty-eight years, and suddenly he was walking. Yet, no one said, “Wow! What happened? How were you cured?” No one praised God that he’d been delivered from decades of infirmity. Instead, the healed man is chastised for carrying his pallet on the Sabbath. And the Jewish leaders want to know, not who cured him, but who had the audacity to tell him to pick up his pallet and walk with it (John 5:12).  \n\nJesus, the Son of God, was there among them. A miracle had been done in their midst. Yet, focusing on the rules of the Sabbath, they missed the Lord of the Sabbath.  \n\nHow often do we do the same? How often are we so focused on one side of a circumstance that we miss God’s purposes altogether?\n\nJesus is the Author of life. And He brings not only life, but light, grace, and glory into that which seems dead, dark, and overwhelming (Acts 3:15; 2 Corinthians 4:6). We’re told to walk by faith and not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7) because when our eyes are faith-filled, we see the divine. We see God. \n\nJesus is always working, in every facet of our lives and the lives of those around us. Let’s pray to keep our eyes fixed on Him, so we can behold every moment.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: John 6:1-71, Acts 3:22-23, Psalm 29:10-11\n\nThe day after Jesus miraculously multiplied loaves and fish, the crowd He fed went looking for Him. They loaded into boats and stalked Jesus across the Sea of Galilee. When they found Him, Jesus knew the real reason they had come: “You are looking for Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate the loaves and were filled. Don’t work for the food that perishes but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you” (John 6:26-27).\n\nThe crowds didn’t yet understand the meaning of the Bread Jesus spoke of, so they took Him literally and hoped He would perform the miracle again. They begged, “Sir, give us this bread always!” (v. 34).\n\nIt sounds demanding, right? A little superficial? How could these people stand before the Son of God who offered them eternal life and demand more barley loaves instead?\n\nIt sounds ridiculous, but it also sounds familiar. I’ve done this before with my prayers and requests. I have often begged for bread (and when I am asking Him for bread, it’s the lower-case bread). I am asking for what I want instead of Jesus Himself. Because, admittedly, what I want is often not Jesus.\n\nOur conversations might go something like this:\n\nMe: I want a new job! I hate this one!\n\nJesus: Here is contentment. It will put your soul at rest. This is what you need. Not a new job.\n\nMe: I want a husband now because everyone else I know is getting married!\n\nJesus: Here is trust. Trust in me and our relationship will deepen.\n\nMe: I don’t know what to do. Give me a sign!\n\nJesus: Here I am. My Spirit lives inside of you, guiding you all the time.\n\nI need the same explanation the crowd did that day when Jesus said, “I am the bread of life.”\n\nThe Bread of Life is so much more than the bread I ask for. It endures (v. 27). It gives life to the whole world (v. 33). It is given freely to those who believe (v. 29). Those who eat it will abide in Christ, and Christ will abide in them (v. 56).\n\nThe true miracle of the Bread of Life is that Jesus is all we need. All that other stuff we are hoping will fill our bellies up? It is nothing compared to Christ Himself.\n\nAfter a bit of refining and a lot of grace, my hope is that we will look up one day and realize that our prayers for perishable things can be simplified into one prayer. May we grow to want only one thing and passionately learn to pray, “Give us Jesus, always!”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kim Cash Tate\n\nText: John 7:1-53, Leviticus 23:39-41, Joel 2:28-29\n\nWhen I was a young girl, I loved to visit my father’s elementary school. He was the principal, and being the principal’s daughter made me feel special. I especially loved the times he sent me on errands. I would walk into the cafeteria or library, looking like any other student. But when the staff learned who I was—and that I’d been sent by my father, the principal—it made all the difference. All that he represented was attached to me.\n\nI love that the book of John sets itself apart from the other Gospels in the way it showcases Jesus as the Son of God. While Matthew, Mark, and Luke together have a handful of instances in which Jesus refers to Himself as “sent” by God, John records more than thirty. As Jesus talked to the crowds—and in particular, to the Jewish leaders—He used some version of these words: “Him who sent me… the One who sent me.” \n\nJesus’ choice of words was purposeful. The Jewish people knew that God had promised to send a Savior. It’s amazing to me that Jesus would tell them so plainly, so many times, that He was the “sent” One. In chapter 7 alone, those words appear five times:\n\n“My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me” (John 7:16).\n\n“… but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him, He is true… ” (John 7:18).\n\n“I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me” (John 7:29).\n\n“For a little while longer I am with you, then I go to Him who sent Me” (John 7:33).\n\nAnd this one:  “I have not come of Myself, but He who sent me is true…” (John 7:28).\n\nGod the Father had been true to His promise. He had sent His Son for the salvation of mankind.  Yet, many who walked and talked with Jesus—who heard Him testify repeatedly that He was the sent One—did not believe.\n\nSo many precious truths are repeated this way throughout the Bible, and I can’t help but wonder at just how often I’m slow to believe them. For instance, while some version of “Do not fear” appears hundreds of times throughout Scripture, there are still countless circumstances arising in day-to-day life that tend to stoke fear deep within my heart. The Bible is replete with assurances of peace and joy despite what’s happening around us. But how long does it take to believe those assurances in a given situation? God trumpets His love for us, unconditional and eternal, a love unsurpassed by any human love we could ever experience. Yet, when we feel the sting of rejection from a friend or loved one, we suddenly feel alone.\n\nGod keeps His word. If a promise is given just once in the Bible, He is faithful to fulfill it. By His grace, He often repeats those promises, giving added assurance to our hearts. With faith, we can stand on those promises and believe, because there is another promise that’s often repeated: our God is true (John 7:28-29). \n\nNo matter how many promises God has made to us, they are all made complete in Jesus. He was sent from God for our salvation, making us daughters of the King. We can believe Him. And when we do, receiving His promises as His children, we bring Him glory (2 Corinthians 1:20). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nText: John 8:1-59, 1 John 1:5-7, Romans 2:25-29\n\nI used to be a morning person, when mornings used to be quiet, solitary, slow. This year they’ve been abrupt, noisy, shoving—everything mornings should not be. I am disgruntled while I tie my shoes. It’s barely past 5am. I know mothers and wives and fathers and farmers and workers all over the world wake up this early, but I am self-employed and childless and have convinced myself I’m owed uninterrupted sleep until at least 6am. Our dog does not agree, and in fact, seems to think the fastest way to my heart right now is through her leash. She noses me until I relent and meet her at the front door.\n\nOutside, the moon is a pregnant belly, super and bright, shining the whole still-dark neighborhood over. How strange, I think, that the Son of God would call Himself the “light of the world,” when the most constant earthly source of light disappears every night, then reemerges as varying sizes and shapes, a mere reflection of the original source. \n\nBut this morning I remember the pillar of fire by night and the cloud by day (Exodus 13:21-22); I remember the star shining in the east (Matthew 2:1-2), the day the sun stood still (Joshua 10:12-13), and the day the earth went dark (Matthew 27:45-54). I think about how the God of the universe created the orbs and commands them even now. He is the One who sets clouds the size of a man’s fist in the sky and makes it rain for forty days and forty nights (Genesis 7:11-12). Storms cease at the sound of His voice (Mark 4:35-41). \n\nJesus tells us, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life” (John 8:12). But the kind of of light He offers, is not of the natural, earthly sort. His light is supernatural and He freely offers it to whomever would follow Him.\n\nYes, Jesus is the light of the world, but when our hope is in anything or anyone other than Him, the world can go grow terribly dark in a hurry. I tend to believe Jesus is near and present when I can clearly see His hand at work in my life. But when I cannot see Jesus at work in my life, He seems absent, distant and busy, too tied up with more important things—more important people—than me.\n\nBut this morning, the supermoon shines a deceptive light on my path, blue, dim, shadowed. Not sunlight, but still of the sun—whether I can see it or not. Walking with the light of the world is like that, too, I think to myself. I am still walking in darkness but I know the light exists. \n\nI come back home to a still, dark, quiet house, with a somewhat less rambunctious pup. She snores beside me on the floor and I drink my coffee slowly, quietly. I have the light of life, I think to myself, even today, in this season that feels dark in many ways. I have the light of life because I follow Jesus, and He never fails to shine, even when His light feels hidden by this world and the brokenness within it. \n\nHe is the One, true light of this world—the sun pales in comparison to the light of His presence. Even darkness is not dark to Him (Psalm 139:11-12).\n\nI light a candle and the room, once dark, is light again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: John 9:1-41, Genesis 2:7, Romans 1:18-20\n\nI believe in Jesus with every cell He created in me. I know He’s the only hope for those who are adrift from His love and truth. And yet, when it’s time to share the gospel, sometimes my palms start to sweat.\n\nWhat if I take a detour off the Romans Road?\n\nWhat if I create more confusion than clarity?\n\nWhat if I get snagged on questions about the finer points of propitiation?\n\nWhat then?\n\nTucked here in John 9, we find a remarkable story about hope, healing, and the beautiful simplicity of the gospel. At the center of the story is a man born blind. Surely, every time he glanced toward something his eyes could not see, he was reminded of his brokenness and need for a Healer. \n\nWhen we come face to face with our inability to be holy as God is holy, or to “fix” ourselves, we realize our need for a Savior. We try to go a day without sinning and fail before our feet hit the floor, once again realizing just how broken we are.\n\nThen the God who healed this man’s eyes lifts ours.\n\nAfter his miraculous healing, the man is pressed by the religious establishment about his encounter with Jesus. He doesn’t debate the points of the Law, or drop a truth bomb, leaving the room in stunned silence. He simply tells his story. Pay attention. It sounds like the chorus of one of the Church’s sweetest anthems.\n\nHe answered, “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.”\n\n– John 9:25\n\nThis man didn’t have Jesus all figured out. He couldn’t explain a God willing to break tradition on the Sabbath He created. He couldn’t reconcile the Pharisees’ perception of God with the reality of his encounter with Jesus, but he did know one thing: “I was blind. Now I see.” He was preaching the gospel. \n\nWhatever else the gospel is, it most certainly is this: “I am a great sinner and Christ is a great Savior.” \n\nThose words were penned by John Newton, writer of the hymn “Amazing Grace.” What the blind man said before the Pharisees, Newton transformed into an anthem for the ages. He cuts to the quick of both our deep need and our source of hope. Like dead eyes revealed this man’s need for a healer, our sin reveals our need for a Savior. Both needs are met Jesus in alone.\n\nThe Pharisees simply could not stand against the undeniable testimony of the the man who had been healed. So radical was his transformation that his friends and neighbors declared him a changed man, “No, he only looks like him” (John 9:9).\n\nFriends, the gospel is not a treasure to be hoarded. The call on each of our lives is to shout it from every rooftop, whisper it in every coffee shop, declare it to every fellow sinner (Matthew 28:16-20). But how? Maybe it’s as simple as Jesus rubbing mud on a blind man’s eyes. \n\nWhen we simply put the story of God’s grace in our own lives on display, we declare, “I was blind. But because of Jesus, now I see.” This is our anthem of hope, and it’s hard to deny hope. We don’t have to have all the answers; our explanations won’t woo others to Jesus. But the aroma of Christ Jesus in us will. It’s His healing presence in our own lives that draws the lost and the blind to the One who brings healing.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: John 10:1-42, Micah 2:12-13, Numbers 27:16-17\n\nAs an Army brat, I did a lot of following when I was a child. Along with my two sisters and my mother, we followed my dad from station to station, Army base to Army base. We moved every few years from the time I was born until the time my father retired when I was sixteen years old. It was an adventure, a privilege, and at times, it was the worst. We didn’t get to follow orders when we wanted to; we followed them when they were given.\n\nWhen I think about my life as a Christian, I often assume it’s going to be like my life as an Army brat: God gives the orders; I follow. His leadership is cold, indifferent, and ultimately, His orders exist to serve His purposes alone, not my good. My feelings, fears, and preferences aren’t considered. I am not consulted; I am told, sent, and left to deal with the emotional fallout on my own. \n\n With that picture as my guide, my feelings toward God become a deadly cocktail of fear, hurt, and distrust. I’m left wondering if He even loves me.\n\nThankfully, through Scripture, God gives us an entirely different picture of how He leads us in this life. And that picture, time and time again, is not of a cold General leading unsuspecting troops into battle, but of a Good Shepherd tending to His flock, caring for their needs, guiding their grazing.\n\nI have to admit, I couldn’t tell you the last time I saw a sheep in a field. But a little internet detective work revealed this: sheep rely heavily on their incredible range of peripheral vision—they can even see behind them without turning their heads. But their depth perception is so poor, they literally cannot see what lies right in front of their noses.\n\nI can say with conviction that these things are true of me, too. It’s easy for me to look to the past behind me, and to the side at what other people are doing. But when I look out in front of me, everything is incredibly hazy. If I’m honest, most of the time, I have no idea where I’m going.\n\nGod knows this about me. He knows I have a weak sense of vision, and so He guides me with His voice. He speaks in many ways, and even when I fear He is silent, Scripture reminds me of just how near He really is: providing for me, leading, renewing, and comforting me (Psalm 23).\n\nThis is the love of the Good Shepherd in action. With Scripture as my guide, I can see God as He truly is. I can learn from the posture of the sheep: I can follow and rest. I can take in beauty and comfort, even in seemingly dark times. I can love the Shepherd, and trust that no one will ever snatch me from His hands (John 10:28).\n\nThere are times when I’d still prefer to follow a god who sends orders via envelope or email, telling me explicitly where to go and what to do next. But that’s not real relationship. The direction and assurance I seek—that each of us need—are found solely in Jesus, the Shepherd-God. \n\nWe move toward Him, not only because we want to, but because He is the only Way. His voice is the only one we were meant to follow.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: John 11:1-57, Daniel 12:2-3, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-14\n\nJohn’s Gospel invites readers to “come and see”—not just to hear Christ’s words, but to engage with Him, to “come and see” who Christ is. This was the way of Christ Himself. When His followers had questions, when they were troubled about the world, Christ invited them to come and see the answer: Him.\n\nWhat is the answer to sin, death and darkness? Christ. Won’t you come and see? \n\nThe phrase “come and see” appears four times in the Gospel of John, and the pattern that appears is this: when we see Christ and what He has to offer, we see life, but when we see what man offers, we see death.\n\n“Come and you’ll see,” He replied. So they went and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day. It was about 10 in the morning (John 1:39).\n\n“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Nathanael asked him. “Come and see,” Philip answered (John 1:46).\n\n“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did! Could this be the Messiah?” (John 4:29).\n\nIn all three instances above, we are invited to “come and see” Christ as the Messiah, to see what He is doing. In contrast, when we focus on what we see in the world, all we’ll find is death and darkness.\n\nIn John 11:34, Jesus asks after his friend Lazarus, saying, “Where have you put him?” “Lord,” they tell Him, “come and see.” But this “come and see” doesn’t point to Christ; instead it points to death.\n\nDeath is all this world has to offer. The only solution to sin and darkness is Christ Jesus. When Christ bids us “come and see,” He shows us life. When the world bids us “come and see,” we find a man laid in a tomb. We find death. \n\nThe next verse, verse 35, tells us that “Jesus wept” for his friend Lazarus. Death has struck a blow, and Jesus weeps to see sin and its consequences in a fallen world. But His tears are not an indication of defeat. Instead, there at Lazarus’s tomb, Christ wages war on death, arresting the powers of death and decay, and reversing them. \n\n“I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in Me, even if he dies, will live. Everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die—ever. Do you believe this?”\n\n– John 11:25-26\n\nThe raising of Lazarus from the dead is a foreshadowing of Christ’s work on the cross, which will come just a short time later (John 19-21). Defeating death once and for all, Jesus Himself is raised from the dead. This time, it is Mary Magdalene who weeps, while looking for the body of her Lord. Jesus asks what she is seeking, then simply calls her by name: “Mary” (John 20:16). He’s calling us too (Isaiah 43:1).\n\nWe have seen who Christ is. The light has come. “Life was in Him, and that life was the light of men” (John 1:4). The invitation is no longer just to “come and see,” but to follow Him, to walk with Him (John 8:12). Now that we have seen the light, we are called to abide in it and bear witness to its power and goodness. \n\nBehold Christ, the light of life. Love Him. Walk with Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Carolyn Denny\n\nText: John 12:1-50, Psalm 118:25-26, Isaiah 6:10, Isaiah 53:1\n\nThere’s an old church joke that the answer to every question in Sunday school is “Jesus.” As I am trying to teach my boys the gospel, I’ve realized how true this is. The answer to almost every major question really is Jesus.\n\nUnfortunately, one of my sons has a terrible time remembering names. Our conversations might go a little something like this:\n\nMe: Who came to save us?\n\nMy boy: God!\n\nMe: Who died on the cross for our sins?\n\nMy boy: God!\n\nMe: And what’s God’s other name?\n\nMy boy: [Silence]\n\nI’m constantly wondering how he can possibly forget the Great Sunday School Answer. But when I read through John chapter 12, I’m see he’s not the only one.\n\nModern culture often wants to distance Jesus from God, to turn Jesus into a great teacher or a prophet. If He were just a good teacher, a great man—anything but the Son of God, and God incarnate—then we could pick and choose from what He said. We wouldn’t have to submit to Him.\n\nWhen we read the New Testament we see this is not just a figment of modern culture; it was a part of first-century culture, too. The religious elite attacked Jesus for blasphemy because they understood that He was claiming to be God. They knew what Jesus meant when He said He was God’s “only Son” (John 3:16), doing His Father’s will (John 6:38). Up until that point, no one else would have dared to call God their “Father” (John 5:18).\n\nIn this chapter, we again see Jesus fulfilling His calling as the Son of God: speaking life to all who will listen, shining light in the darkness, and bringing glory to God the Father. We even catch a glimpse of the relationship between God the Father and God the Son, as Jesus wrestles with what’s to come:\n\n“Now My soul is troubled. What should I say—Father, save Me from this hour? But that is why I came to this hour. Father, glorify Your name!” \n\nThen a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again!” (John 12:27-28).\n\nIt is a precious insight into the Trinity, our relational God. He has come at great cost to Himself in order to seek relationship with us, offering us the resurrection and the life. \n\nNo wonder Mary was led to worship Him. No wonder the Greeks wanted to see Jesus (John 12:20). No wonder the crowd sang, “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord” (Matthew 23:39). God—Jesus—truly is the answer to our most important questions, the remedy for our greatest fears.\n\n",

What comes out of our mouths when life squeezes us in its vise grip is the stuff we’re really made of. \n\nAt the Last Supper, we find Jesus in the tightest situation imaginable. He knows unthinkable suffering is right around the corner. Since His disciples are still presuming He is going to lead a government takeover, it’s a burden He must carry alone. Jesus knows there will be no military coup. He will secure the Kingdom victory, but through suffering—not conquest. \n\nIn that crucible of suffering, the real Jesus shines through. We don’t catch one hint of self-pity or bitterness in His words or actions. He would soon be poured out on our behalf, yet Jesus remained faithful to who He is and what He came to do.\n\nHe never stopped teaching. Using bread and wine for an object lesson of cosmic consequences, Jesus taught truths in advance that His disciples would not grasp until He was gone (John 12:16). As modern Christ followers, we have access to this Upper Room as a classroom. We’re able to wrestle with the lessons of His atoning sacrifice every time we come to take communion. \n\nHe never stopped serving. Knowing that within hours His own would be nailed to a tree, Jesus took the time to wash His disciples’ feet. “So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done for you” (John 13:14-15). This moment wasn’t mere ritual. Jesus was showing them how to care for one another after He departed.\n\nHe never stopped loving. When I study the Last Supper, I am most grateful for this truth: “Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end” (John 13:1). To the end. Our Savior never stopped loving the undeserving, helpless sinners He came to die for. He never chose hatred or contempt. He didn’t shame or ostracize Judas, the one who would sell Him out for a few silver coins. Instead of pointing His finger at him, Jesus offered him bread.\n\nWhen hard-pressed on every side, Jesus never resented the sacrifice He chose to make on our behalf. It was in His suffering that our Savior displayed His true strength.\n\n“But he was pierced because of our rebellion,\n\ncrushed because of our iniquities;\n\npunishment for our peace was on him,\n\nand we are healed by his wounds.”\n\n– Isaiah 53:5\n\n",

Sometimes even a small decision can lead to an overwhelming list of pros and cons. In my heart of hearts, I know I want pizza for dinner, but maybe I should want the soup, or the salad… or the chicken. You’d think dinner would be a simpler decision. (The answer is pizza. Always choose the pizza!) When it’s so easy to complicate the tiniest of decisions, how do we come to any sense of peace and assurance about the bigger matters in life?\n\nThe Christian faith is simple and complicated at the same time. We are called to have faith like a child (Matthew 18:3), and also to grow toward maturity (Hebrews 6:1). In some places the Word of God seems so straightforward, and yet the psalmist declared some knowledge too wonderful and lofty to grasp (Psalm 139:6). The seeming contradiction between this simplicity and complexity speaks to the mystery of the gospel. But when it comes to our salvation, Jesus doesn’t want there to be any confusion.\n\nIt’s funny—and oddly reassuring—just how human the disciples were. By the time we come to John 14, they were well into their ministry alongside the Son of God. You would think after all the miracles and face-to-face teachings from Jesus, they would have learned the basics. But when Jesus talked about the way to heaven, the disciples seemed totally and utterly confused!\n\nSo, once again, He spoke clearly, telling them:\n\n“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. If you know Me, you will also know My Father. From now on you do know Him and have seen Him.”\n\n– John 14:6-7\n\nJesus spells it out for His disciples—and for us, too—so that there can be no misunderstanding. He is the way to freedom. He is truth and life.\n\nThere are parts of our faith that are truly complex because we love and serve an infinite God. There are some questions that don’t have simple answers. The gospel is like an intricately woven tapestry, with threads intertwining in hidden places, forming the most epic story of all time. God gives us minds to think and question and analyze these mysteries with humility, so that we might grow in our understanding and love.\n\nBut, some parts of the Word are crystal clear. \n\nJesus came to our world in the form of a man so that His followers could see, know, and touch the love of their Father. In a world full of confusion, God wants His people to know exactly who He is.\n\nIf you know Jesus, you know the Creator of all and the way to salvation. As you “work out your salvation with fear and trembling” (Philippians 2:12), may you find peace in the straightforward declarations and promises of our Lord.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: John 15:1-27, Zephaniah 3:14-17\n\nI’m the queen of focusing on the wrong things.\n\nMy daughter makes an amazing piece of 9-year-old art and declares it dedicated to her mom (that’s me!)—and I silently lament the sea of paper covering the floor and the glue stick smashed into all the creases of the dining room table.\n\nA long-lost friend says she and her family are coming to visit for a weekend—and I spend more time worrying about the condition of the guest room than rejoicing in the long conversations and late-night laughter to come.\n\nMy husband spends hours creating new storage solutions for our mudroom (slash laundry room, slash pantry, slash coat closet, slash place the dog stays during dinner so he won’t eat food off our plates)—and I involuntarily scowl that my tired, dirty, three-compartment clothes hamper will no longer fit. (Three compartments! You can understand my sadness.)\n\nAnd here, in John chapter 15, Jesus says this:\n\n“Remain in me, and I in you. Just as a branch is unable to produce fruit by itself unless it remains on the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without me”\n\n(vv. 4-5, emphasis mine). \n\nThis is what He says. But do you know what I hear? I hear, “Bear fruit.” Or, to be more specific, “Hey, you, why aren’t you bearing fruit?” I, the Queen of Focusing On The Wrong Things, read Jesus’ words and hear all of the goal and none of the grace. I want the end but forget the means.\n\nYes, bear fruit. Yes, love others. Yes, give grace to a world that will misunderstand and even hate us. But look back through John 15. Jesus is not commanding His disciples to bear fruit. The command is to remain. When we remain—when we abide in the never-ending, unconditional, forever love of Christ—then the fruit will come. \n\nWe bear fruit when, and only when, we are grafted into the True Vine. His Holy Spirit in us is the fruit producer; we are simply the branches who have the privilege of displaying His fruit.\n\nJesus Christ comes to make us new. He comes to redeem the dead branches that we are and give us abundant life! Remaining in Him—resting, dwelling, abiding in Him—is the only source of our strength, our goodness, our fruit. \n\nLet’s focus our eyes on the True Vine today. Let’s be about the business of remaining in Jesus, and trust His Spirit to be about the business of bearing fruit in our lives. \n\nLord, teach us what it means to remain when all we want to do is produce. Help us to rest in your never-stopping love. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: John 16:1-33, Isaiah 32:14-18, Romans 8:12-17\n\nMost mornings, I go to a local coffee shop in East Nashville where I order my two-dollar coffee, sit in a corner, and try to bang out a few words on my machine. They know my name here. They welcome me in the door, ask how my writing is going, and never give me the slant-eye when my coffee goes cold, while I continue to suck electricity from their walls and Wi-Fi out of their air. Here, it’s easy to pretend that life is all lattes and progress.\n\nBut the reality is, everyone around me is experiencing their own pain. The girl who stops by my table just had a miscarriage. The grey-haired man eating his oatmeal while reading the paper just lost his wife last year. The exhausted, lonely mother at the register keeps trying to order her coffee, but stops to run out the door after her two-year-old escape artist. The newspaper sitting next to me screams its headlines of tragedy: War Rages On! Politicians Still Lie! Poverty Eats Away at the Hungry!\n\nWe’re all acquainted with our own brand of heartache. It’s enough to bring you to the same conclusion as Solomon in Ecclesiastes: “I observed everything going on under the sun, and really, it is all meaningless—like chasing the wind” (Ecclesiastes 1:14).\n\nThis view of suffering is the fare the world offers up to us for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The world tells us that if we’re hurting, it’s up to us to change our circumstances so we won’t hurt anymore. We’re to follow our heart, chase our dreams, and forsake everything—even our responsibilities, family, and God— in order to secure our own happiness in the world. But in the midst of all that noise, Jesus provides a much different view of suffering. \n\nWith some of His last words to His disciples, Jesus predicted that trouble was coming. He said they would be kicked out of the temple—losing the social center of their lives (Luke 21:5-6). They would be ostracized, killed, and separated from one another. But most importantly, He told them to expect these things, to not be surprised when they happened. Grief would be a part of their experience here on earth, just as it’s a part of ours. \n\nBut Jesus doesn’t leave us in our sorrow. He promises to turn our grief into joy (John 16:20). He tells us we’re to have courage because He’s already conquered the evil in this world (John 16:33)—and, in fact, He’s making us a new one (Isaiah 65:17).\n\nThe world tells us to break free from grief because our time here is limited. Jesus invites us to welcome our grief as the precursor to eternity. In that way, our pain is not a state of being that needs to be avoided; it is an access point to the throne of God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: John 17:1-26, Isaiah 42:8, 1 John 5:20\n\nThis has been a difficult week for me. I am heartbroken. I am utterly aching with loss. I feel upside-down in my sadness. Have you ever felt this way? Honestly, I wonder who hasn’t. What is your heart aching for today as you read these verses in John 17?\n\nSometimes when I find myself in the depths, cracking my Bible open is the last thing I want to do. But for some reason, today, I craved falling into Scripture. I felt that God had something for me here, in this passage. And oh, how rich this passage is, especially for the aching heart.\n\nThe hour had come for our Savior. As I read His prayer, I can almost feel His aching, His longing to protect those who’ve come to believe in Him. As He anticipated the events to come, He pleaded with the Father for the disciples He loved:\n\n“Now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to You, Holy Father, keep through Your name those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We are.”\n\n-John 17:11\n\nCan you imagine being in the presence of Christ as He is praying for you? Sitting in the same room with Him, hearing Him say just before, “in this world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world,” and then watching Jesus turn His eyes heavenward and, in prayer, put your life and soul into the Father’s care?\n\nWhen I read Jesus’ prayer today, something cracked open. I felt the fervent love He has for me, the fervent love He has for us all. Right after He prayed for the disciples, He prayed for those who will believe (John 17:20). Jesus prayed for you, and He prayed for me, too—for all who would come to trust in Him.\n\nHe knew this world. He lived it, walked it, saw the desperation and the brokenness. He knew what it would mean for us to be here—that we would face a seemingly endless stream of trial and tribulation. Knowing what was to come for His disciples and for who would believe, He said:\n\n“I am not praying\n\nthat You take them out of the world\n\nbut that You protect them from the evil one.”\n\n-John 17:15\n\nHe did not pray for our suffering to end, or for the pain and sorrow to cease. Instead, He prayed for our protection as we face these trials and circumstances. He prayed that we would not face them alone, but with the support of our community and our God.\n\n“May they all be one,\n\nas You, Father, are in Me and I am in You.\n\nMay they also be one in Us,\n\nso the world may believe You sent Me.”\n\n-John 17:21\n\nThe idea that Jesus is not only near us, but in us—not only for us, but a part of us—brings comfort to my heart as nothing else can. “I in them, and You in Me” (v. 23)—this is His will for the Church.\n\nWhatever you face today, we as believers are one in Him, and this oneness tells the world of the glory of God. Perhaps that is why writing this has felt so healing for me: it has reminded me that I am not alone in heartache. We are all still in this world, though not of it, and whether it is joy or suffering that binds us, God is glorified in our unity.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Not of This World",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Carolyn Denny\n\nText: John 18:1-40, Daniel 7:14\n\nThe hour Jesus was born for had finally come. He’d been predicting it, waiting for it, knowing what it would require of Him: arrest, pain, and death. For anyone else, this would be a crisis moment, to be sure. For the Son of God, it was an opportunity for the most profound display of obedience, love, and humility ever known.\n\nJohn’s account of this night shows us the holiness of Jesus, God incarnate—deliberate, powerful, wise, and gentle. Put simply, He is not of this world. But the people surrounding Him? They proved themselves to be oh-so very human.\n\nAt this point, Judas’ secret sin had finally consumed him. All those months on the road—stealing from the disciples’ treasury, betraying his friends—had prepared him for this moment, and he intended to capitalize on it. Jesus responded as only He can: by declaring His deity, revealing His glory, and protecting His disciples. And even as He submitted to His arrest, Jesus gave Judas one last chance to see His true identity.\n\nPeter was a man of action, refusing to sit around and wait for Jesus to die. He followed his heart, despite Jesus’ teaching and example—despite knowing better. First, he sliced off the soldier’s ear to protect his Lord, then he denied Jesus altogether. His Savior’s response was not one of condemnation, but of grace. He protected Peter, gently rebuked him, and restored him (John 21). He continued to build Peter’s faith, even in His darkest hours.\n\nAnnas was one of the richest, most powerful Jews of his time. There was no way he’d be willing to let some upstart from the outskirts destroy everything he’d spent a lifetime building. Believing Jesus was leading the people away from his agenda, Annas had no problem breaking a few laws to get rid of Him. But Jesus had nothing to hide, no secret life to reveal. So He turned the tables on Annas, subtly challenging the leader’s interrogation of Him (which had been done in secret, and therefore, was against their civil laws). \n\nAs for Pilate, he’d learned not to interfere in Jewish matters and had become skilled at shifting responsibility. To him, this was a Jewish problem for the Jews to work out amongst themselves. But to Jesus, this wasn’t just a Jewish issue but a human one, an eternal one. It was about a Kingdom impacting the whole world and beyond, a Kingdom rooted in Truth.\n\nIn this series of events, John’s Gospel makes one thing clear: our Savior is fundamentally different from this world. His response is never fed by deception or greed or fear, but rather by an otherworldly compassion for His people and command over all circumstances. He will always accomplish His gracious plan, often in unforeseeable ways.\n\nLike the events in John 18, life can seem like one long, dark night, leaving us feeling betrayed, wounded, and scared. It’s easy to relate to Peter’s impulse to fix the situation, or Pilate’s attempts to distance himself from it. But then I see Jesus walking into the darkness, knowing all there is to fear, yet bolstered by confidence in the Father’s plan to rescue all who love Him. \n\nIt’s tempting, perhaps even good, to feel inspired by Christ’s example. But I’m finding I don’t always have the wherewithal to follow Jesus’ lead. I need to lean on Him, push against Him, knowing He will never falter or fail. Seeing His response to such an array of broken people is healing and soul-nourishing for me, a sinner. Our Savior was gentle, trustworthy, and sovereign on the darkest night in history, and He will be so with us today, even now.\n\n",

They stood outside for hours—5 hours, come to think of it—watching their kites soar in the air. They flew kites while singing songs. They flew kites while dancing. They flew kites while running in circles and they even flew kites while lying down. My personal favorite? When they flew kites while singing AND lying down.\n\nAs I sat on a blanket and watched the event unfold, it reminded me of a Billy Graham quote about the wind. You fellow youth group kids of the early 90’s know the one; I’m pretty sure it was spliced into the beginning of a DC Talk song: “Can you see God? You haven’t seen him? I’ve never seen the wind. I see the effects of the wind, but I’ve never seen the wind. There’s a mystery to it.”\n\nBelieving in what we cannot see can be downright hard. Even those who walked the earth with Jesus wanted to see more of Him in order to believe or hold onto belief. The crowds followed Him, pushing in closer and longing to catch a real, live glimpse of the Messiah in action.\n\nMary Magdalene was one who followed Jesus faithfully. Even after His death she went to the tomb, anxious to see the body of her Savior; and when He wasn’t there, she wept. \n\nMary needed to see Jesus. Then He appeared to her there where she knelt crying, and she saw Him and believed! \n\nThe disciple Thomas heard the news that Jesus had risen from the dead. “We have seen the Lord,” the others told him (John 20:24). But Thomas was a doubter, like I’m prone to be. \n\nThomas needed to touch Jesus. “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe” (v. 25). And Thomas touched his hands to Jesus’ hands and believed!\n\nWe can understand our sister Mary and our brother Thomas, can’t we? In the hurry and sorrow and uncertainty of this life, we need a hope we can see and feel. But unlike Mary, we don’t get to see Jesus face to face. And unlike Thomas, we don’t get to put our fingers on His nail-scarred hands. Yes, we can see God’s mercy at work in the world, making broken things new. We can feel the Holy Spirit changing our hearts, softening what once was stone. But the darkest valleys leave our eyes and hands searching for something we can’t seem to find. \n\nJesus knew this would be hard for us. It’s why He gives us faith—to believe. Paul tells us faith is a gift, not something we muster up on our own (Ephesians 2:8). And Jesus calls those who have it blessed (John 20:29). He has also given us His very Spirit to live within us (John 14:26), and His Word to guide us (Psalm 119:105). Though we can’t yet lay eyes on Christ, He lays His hand of mercy on us by the indwelling of His Spirit and the gift of His Word. \n\nThere will be times when we struggle to believe what we cannot see. But the risen Savior is ever near, as alive as He was the day He spoke to a distraught Mary, and the day He beckoned Thomas to touch His side. When we have trouble seeing Him in our lives, we can see Him here, in the pages of His Word. \n\n",

My brain was so clouded by pregnancy hormones and sleep deprivation that I didn’t know what I needed or how to ask for help. \n\nSo Mandy made me pancakes. \n\nMandy and I weren’t friends, exactly. We mostly smiled at each other in the halls of our church, but she called me one evening with this invitation: “Come over tomorrow morning, first thing. Bring your little guy and stay in your jammies. I’m going to make you pancakes.”\n\nNot typically the kind of gal to show up at a stranger’s house in my jammies, I’m surprised I accepted her offer. I’m usually more of a “spiff everything up and look like you have it together” kind of girl. Even so, the next morning we headed over to Mandy’s in our comfies. \n\nThose were the best pancakes of my life. Food eaten on dishes I didn’t have to wash was a lifeline of sorts. That moment of simple compassion stuck with me long after I cleaned (okay fine, licked) my plate and headed home. \n\nYears later I was surprised to find a similar story in John 21. \n\nAfter a night of fruitless fishing to punctuate the best and worst months of their lives, Peter, James, John, and a handful of other disciples found themselves staring out at the same waves Jesus had walked upon. Everything had changed since then. Jesus had been arrested, crucified, and buried. Their hopes were dashed and they scattered, fearing for their lives. Peter’s grief was compounded by the agonizing memory that he denied the Savior not once, not twice, but three times. \n\nAlmost immediately after everything went so terribly wrong, Jesus started setting it right again. His death was trumped by His resurrection. His scared disciples were refocused by His return. Even Peter’s denials got reversed. \n\nJesus called His fishing friends to the shore. Peter was so anxious to be with his Savior that he jumped right out of the boat fully clothed (John 21:7). When they got to shore, they found that Jesus had made them breakfast. It was a simple gesture that demonstrated profound care and compassion. In His glorified state, Jesus tenderly met His friends’ physical needs before offering an even better portion. \n\nDuring a post-breakfast stroll, Jesus gave Peter not one, not two, but three chances to declare his love. For every denial, Peter got to make a proclamation (John 21:15-17). Though sinned against, Jesus initiated reconciliation and offered tender mercies. \n\nIn this last chapter of John’s Gospel, we see the risen Christ doing more of what He’d done all along: love and serve, invite and forgive. In fact, John ends his account of Jesus’ life by stating there were so many more things that Jesus did, “if they were written one by one, I suppose not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written” (John 21:25). Volume after volume of love and service. Book after book of invitation and forgiveness. \n\nPerhaps emulating Jesus is simpler than we think. Offer grace. Pursue reconciliation. Forgive freely. Whenever possible, love others well by serving them. Pancakes optional.\n\n",

It feels significant, doesn’t it? Even the “men in white robes” acknowledged there was a mystery to Jesus’ comings and goings (Acts 1:10). The way Jesus departed was mysterious; it didn’t make sense. And it was also somehow certain—beyond a shadow of a doubt—according to the tribe of eyewitnesses. \n\nWhen I think about the mysterious and certain things I’ve experienced in my 33 years, my mind immediately goes to Thin Mints® cookies. There have been occasions upon which I have settled into a stack of four or five cookies and a nice book, only to find myself shocked when, as I reach to lift another cookie from my stack, they are all certainly, and mysteriously, gone.\n\nI sometimes daydream when I’m driving on the interstate and suddenly realize I have mysteriously, but quite certainly, missed my exit by three miles. \n\nThen there was the time when the life of our friends’ son was mysteriously, but certainly, spared. He climbed out of a crumpled car that had flipped over several times and wrapped around a telephone pole—yet he walked away with nary a scratch. \n\nGranted, disappearing cookies are far less mysterious than a spared life that, by all practical and scientific realities, should have been taken. Sometimes things are mysterious because we’re not paying attention, and other times they are a mystery because we were never meant to fully comprehend them. Not yet. \n\nThe mystery of the gospel is the latter. Jesus ascended mysteriously into heaven with the words, “It is not for you to know,” fresh on His lips. I love that so much. “But you will receive power,” He continued, “and you will be My witnesses.” And with that, He was taken up “as they were watching” (Acts 1:7-9). It was mysterious, but certain. \n\nOne element of Jesus’ ascension, however, was not mysterious at all: He left with a clear command to get up and go “to the ends of the earth.” To go become a Church. Go spread the good news of His life, death, and resurrection to the entire world. And to go with a parting gift: the power of the Holy Spirit, who would accompany them, and from whom they—and we—would receive power to carry out this not so mysterious commission. \n\nThe book of Acts begins with a heavenly mix of both mystery and certainty, and the combination will dance artfully across all 28 chapters. \n\nThere will be mystery: the things of God’s Kingdom might not seem to add up, as they so often do not by our earthly standards.\n\nAnd there will be certainty: the gospel of Jesus Christ will move with the clarity that only comes from the Father. It will sprout and spread, beginning in Judea, then moving on to Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\n\nThe birth of the early Church is our story. This is where we come from, and it’s where we are going. It’s the story of how we are called to reach out, and how we are called to come together. \n\nCome, read with us—all six weeks, all 28 chapters. Watch the gospel grow legs and walk around. Watch the early Church figure things out, learn how to love each other in community, and discover how to resolve legitimate conflicts with care. See how they give their lives in faith for the Man they watched—with their very own eyes—live, die, rise, and ascend into heaven.The Man they knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, really is the Son of God. The Man the Church still believes will return, just as certainly and mysteriously as He left. \n\nLet’s enter into the book of Acts with hearts full of wonder and minds filled with confidence that the gospel changes everything.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Coming of the Holy Spirit",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessie Minassian\n\nText: Acts 2:1-47, Joel 2:28-32, Psalm 16:8-11\n\nBig grew from small.\n\nTrue to form, God chose a small house, in a small city, in a small country, to be fertile ground for a new gospel Kingdom—the one Jesus had been preaching about, training His disciples to understand, and preparing the Jews to anticipate.\n\nOn the day of Pentecost, the promised Holy Spirit burst forth into this Kingdom, rolling outward and across the city, the nation, and beyond. If the book of Acts is the birth story of the Church, then the coming of the Holy Spirit was the initiating event—the dramatic impetus powering every account we read about in the rest of the book.\n\nSo let’s take a closer look and mull this over a bit. Let’s take the time to appreciate the magnitude of what happened on that very first Pentecost.\n\nHe knew they were distraught, but Jesus assured His disciples that it was necessary for Him to leave the earth. It was for their benefit that He go so that Someone else—the Counselor and Advocate—could come “convict the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment” (John 16:5-8).\n\nJesus taught,\n\nand the Holy Spirit would illuminate and convict.\n\nJesus held all knowledge,\n\nand the Holy Spirit would come and declare those truths to the world. \n\nJesus had authority over the future,\n\nand the Spirit would “declare what is to come” (John 16:13).\n\nThe Counselor is not a consolation prize. The Holy Spirit is God’s gift to the Church.\n\nWhile Jesus’ coming was as quiet as a Holy Night, the Holy Spirit’s arrival was radical (Acts 2:2-4), and rightly so. It had to be. The impressive signs—the thunderous sound of wind, tongues of fire, and speaking in foreign languages—were intentionally bold, giving credence to the equally audacious claims the disciples were about to make. But their words would not be their own. When Jesus commissioned His uneducated, ragtag crew, He promised they would “be given what to say at that hour” (Matthew 10:19). The Spirit of God Himself would speak through them.\n\nPeter’s first sermon showcased the power and authority of the Spirit (Acts 2:14-40). He delivered a rousing message, but not because of his religious pedigree or even his training under Jesus. Peter’s soul-splitting message was the Holy Spirit’s glory on display. Without such extravagant signs, the crowd most likely would have dismissed Peter’s outrageous claim that Jesus, the Messiah promised of old, was very much alive.\n\nFrom that first sermon on, the Holy Spirit’s influence spread like holy concentric circles, empowering each new believer to live in a revolutionary way—selling personal possessions to meet the needs of others, sharing meals together, and living in harmony with other sinners (Acts 2:41-47). By the power of the Spirit, the early Church learned to do life together in gracious, generous, and intentional ways.\n\nGod’s new Kingdom was worthy of its epic announcement. As Jesus said new wine must be poured into new wineskins or both will be lost (Mark 2:22), this new Kingdom needed a new paradigm to be effective in spreading the gospel to the nations. God got their attention on that very first Pentecost. He allowed them to see the Holy Spirit on the move, rolling out like a wave across the city of Jerusalem and beyond, filling new believers with a power no one saw coming.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Acts 3:1-26, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, Deuteronomy 18:15-19\n\nBisque. It’s a soup I’d stirred in a bowl, warmed in a saucer, slurped with a spoon, but never actually learned how to pronounce. (Say it with me now: “bisk.”)\n\nThat is, until it was too late.\n\nI was an over-eager high schooler, working my first job as a waitress in a retirement home. My first task at the beginning of each shift was to shuffle my non-slip shoes to each table of residents and recite that evening’s dinner menu. They would all nod in unison at the mention of pork chops and green beans, mashed potatoes and yeast rolls—a rotating list most of them could have recited themselves. Oh, and the soup of the day, you ask? Butternut bisque.\n\n“Butternut bis-kway,” I projected enthusiastically. (In my defense, the “q” makes it look all fancy and foreign and makes me want to speak in an accent, okay?)\n\nEyebrows furrowed and whispers ensued as I skipped confidently into the kitchen to inquire about—what I assumed to be—an exotic new dish I’d get to introduce. But I was soon called out, forced to correct my mistake. Butternut “bis-kway” was, in fact, the same ole butternut “bisk” that had been served every Tuesday for years. Those sweet residents never trusted me with their soup orders again.\n\nIn Acts 3, Peter is calling out the early Church—not because of a silly mistake or mispronunciation, but because of a miracle. When a crippled man known around town for begging at the temple gates encountered Peter, he didn’t get the silver or gold he asked for; he got something much, much better.\n\n“I don’t have silver or gold, but what I have, I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, get up and walk!”\n\n-Acts 3:6 \n\nThe man was healed. He could walk. A miracle indeed! But when the crowd around them looked at Peter and John with shocked faces, Peter asked, “Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this?” (Acts 3:12).\n\nWhy was Peter so frustrated? What did the people get wrong?\n\nThe Israelites misread the miracle. \n\nIn Acts 3, God empowered Peter to give the crippled man more than what he asked for, yet exactly what he needed, surpassing human limitations in doing so. The onlookers’ amazement suggested they believed this extraordinary act was the result of superhuman powers or even a fluke. But Peter set them straight, explaining that everything they witnessed was in line with the Truth he’d been trying to tell them all along.\n\nThey would misunderstand the purpose of miracles altogether. \n\nSince this is the first miracle mentioned in the book of Acts, it’s a pivotal time for the early Church—and you and me—to learn the real deal about miracles. Peter didn’t start a fire with his hands or make the beggar levitate—he healed him. Miracles are given to awaken confidence in God and to heal humanity. Each miracle Jesus and His apostles performed gave a glimpse into God’s plan to restore all things (Acts 3:21). Each act pointed to the truest miracle of all: Christ Himself.\n\nThey would mispronounce the gospel of Christ. \n\nThe crowd watched as the beggar took his first steps, but they themselves would walk away believing and preaching a false gospel. They missed the point entirely; miracles aren’t just for our physical benefit, but for our spiritual benefit. While Peter said, “Get up and walk!” to the beggar, the miracle whispers two more words to us: “to Christ.” \n\nGet up and walk to Christ. \n\nFriends, may we do the same. Instead of skipping away with false assumptions, may our hearts rest in the Truth of the One, true miracle.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: Acts 4:1-22, 2 Corinthians 3:12-18, 1 John 5:12\n\nAnnas and Caiaphas were trying to do damage control—and fast.\n\nThey’d conspired to kill Jesus, and as far as they could tell, the plot had been successful. Of course, a rabble of people claimed Jesus had risen from the dead, but that was preposterous—wasn’t it? All they needed was to imprison a few more people, defame a few more miracles, and then this whole charade would be over for good. Things could get back to normal.\n\nNormal. That sounds familiar.\n\n“I just can’t wait for things to get back to normal.”\n\n“I’m looking forward to getting back into our regular routine.”\n\n“Once _______ (fill in the blank) happens, things will settle down again.”\n\nI’ve said these words before. They give me a false sense of control, a sense of hope that soon all the chaos will be behind me and the storm will pass.\n\nI’ll go to great lengths, trying to maintain a sense of normalcy. I’m desperate for it. So desperate that, the more God tries to change my circumstances, the more I gripe and moan and disobey because it hurts to lose what I’ve worked so hard to construct as mine.\n\nAnnas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas (John 18:13). As high priests, their “normal” meant power, prestige, and position. The two worked side by side to make atonement for the people of Israel (Leviticus 16:32-34). Minor celebrities in their culture, they spent their days clothed in beautiful linen garments and purifying the holiest of places within the temple. Without their atoning work of sacrifice, all of Israel would fall away from the Lord into sin and destruction.\n\nThat is, until Jesus.\n\nIf what Peter and John preached was true, then Annas and Caiaphas’ work no longer held any meaning. If Jesus had really risen from the dead, then He was the real High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16), and life as Annas and Caiaphas knew it was over. It meant they were unemployed, power-hungry murderers, with no role to play in society. And rather than accept the fact that they were just as sinful as the people they’d been trying to atone for, they tightened their fists around their own power.\n\nBut Peter and John stood before the Lord’s murderers unfazed. Filled with boldness, eloquence, and joy, they proclaimed the Truth: there is salvation in no one else (Acts 4:12).\n\nHow’s this for a paraphrase: Hey, Annas, Caiaphas. You think you’re making a legacy for yourselves, but this is all going to come to an end. Your efforts to circumvent God are not going to work. And you are just as sinful as you’re afraid to admit. \n\nI imagine Solomon nodding his head: in Ecclesiastes, he reminds us that everything we pursue is absolute futility (Ecclesiastes 1:1-11). And in Corinthians, we’re told that even feeding the poor, having faith, and donating all our money mean nothing unless we have Love Himself (1 Corinthians 13:1-3).\n\nThere is salvation in no one else. Not outside of your marriage. Not inside a better routine. Not with that pair of shoes. Not once you lose fifteen pounds. The storm of change has come into your life, and His name is Jesus. His rival is your sense of control over what’s “normal.”\n\nPeter and John knew that the storm was only just beginning. They could be bold and fearless because they knew, without question, that they were anchored in the only Truth that can sustain the volatile winds and waves of that storm.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Acts 4:23-37, Acts 5:1-16, Deuteronomy 15:4-6, Hebrews 6:13-20\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was scared of the dark.\n\nAt night, I would quicken my step down the hallway when passing a darkened room. My own room was upstairs, and before bedtime, I would run up to dark windows to pull down their pink shades; large trees loomed just outside, holding who-knows-what in the darkness.\n\nI was afraid of what I did not know, and certain that the unknown could, and would, hurt me.\n\nMy heart’s inclination is to treat the story of Ananias and Sapphira like those darkened windows in my childhood bedroom. I want to run past it, afraid to stop and look for fear of what I might find. \n\nThe chief priests and elders were afraid too. They saw the wonders and heard the testimonies brought on by the spread of the gospel, and they demanded that the apostles stop preaching (Acts 4:17). They were afraid of what they did not understand. But the gospel is true even when we don’t believe.  \n\nThe apostles knew this. Their intimate experience of Christ’s salvation so affected them, they not only refused to stop preaching and healing in the name of Jesus, they prayed that the Holy Spirit would equip them to preach and heal all the more (Acts 4:29-30).\n\nAnd so the effects of the gospel continued to spread, in spite of the Council’s warnings. The power of the gospel was so great that this newfound church poured out all they had for the glory of God and the good of their fellow believers. “There was not a needy person among them” (v. 34).\n\nThis was the context in which Ananias approached Peter with a portion of the proceeds from the land he’d sold, and a premeditated lie about the full amount of the sale. Picture that: while the church was literally giving their all—preaching the gospel and being arrested, giving freely and relying individually and collectively on the grace of Jesus—Ananias and his wife cooked up a plan not only to deceive the church, but to deceive God. \n\nThe couple did not fear God as holy. They did not trust God as good. They believed God could be tricked, and they set out to do just that. And we know what became of them: in pretending to give all, they lost all.\n\nBut the story of Ananias and Sapphira isn’t about money. \n\nThis story is not a departure from the stories of gospel power demonstrated in the chapters preceding it—power that healed the sick, fed the hungry, provided for the poor, and saved souls by the thousands. This, too, was the living God at work, and the living God is to be revered as holy and powerful and good, because He is.\n\nI don’t have to be afraid of this holy God the way I was once afraid of the dark. He is not unknown, like the night time darkness lurking outside my bedroom windows. No, our God has intentionally and carefully made Himself known. Through the person of Jesus Christ and through His Word, we are invited to know the real, holy Him. \n\nWe may not fully understand His ways, but we can see His fingerprints on each page of the whole Story. We see them when He gives His covenant to Adam and Abraham and David, and when He pursues His people, though they run. We see them in Jesus’ life and death and in the glory of the resurrection. We see them when we are given forgiveness and mercy, instead of judgment and death. And we see them in this story, too, as God reveals His unquestionable, uncompromising holiness to His people in a powerful way.\n\nHe is holy. And He is wholly good. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nText: Acts 5:12-42, Isaiah 40:6-8, 1 John 2:15-17, John 6:66-69\n\nI have always been enchanted by the glamour, music, and energy of the Roaring Twenties. Naturally, The Great Gatsby is a favorite book of mine. If you haven’t read the book or seen the movie, the plot centers on Jay Gatsby, a man with one goal: to win the heart of the charming Daisy Buchanan.\n\nMr. Gatsby doesn’t consult God about his grand plans to win over Daisy. Rather, he sets out to make himself a new man worthy of her pedigree—a man of fame and fortune. But despite Gatsby’s best efforts, (spoiler alert) he does not ultimately end up with his lady love. And while hundreds—maybe thousands—once attended his infamous parties, Gatsby’s funeral is a lonely affair, and he’s quickly forgotten by most.\n\nHow could someone who worked so hard with such a singular purpose, fail and be forgotten?\n\nWhen we look at the book of Acts, we see the apostles giving everything they have to accomplish a goal. Unlike Gatsby, these men are driven by God’s purpose rather than their own desires. And the outcome couldn’t be more different.\n\nEven with God leading them, the apostles’ journey wasn’t without difficulties. When the apostles started to gain a following for the Lord, the jealous Sadducees imprisoned them. But the plans God had set in motion could not be stopped, and the men were miraculously freed to continue preaching. When dragged before the Sanhedrin, they remained committed to the mission the Lord had called them to, bravely proclaiming:\n\n“We must obey God rather than men.”\n\n-Acts 5:29\n\nHonest though the apostles’ explanation was, it didn’t sit well with the Sanhedrin, who’d become intent on killing them (Acts 5:33). But Gamaliel, a wise and respected Pharisee among the council, persuaded the others to leave the men alone. “For if this plan or this work is of men, it will be overthrown; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You may even be found fighting against God” (Acts 5:38-39).\n\nJay Gatsby was a man with plans to make his own name great, but his plans failed and his legacy was forgotten. The apostles, on the other hand, were not working in their own power or crafting their own strategy for success—they were listening to the Lord and joining in His plans as “fellow workers” (1 Corinthians 3:9). Even when the apostles faced imprisonment, beatings, and the threat of death, they were strengthened in the Spirit to endure such trials and to spread the gospel, a teaching with eternal value.\n\nIt’s tempting to follow our own desires apart from God, striving for recognition and trying to make a name for ourselves. We can easily become confused by our own motivations. Are we pursuing this job or relationship to bring glory to God, or to build our own kingdom? Are we walking in our own strength, or by the guidance of the Spirit? \n\nJesus promised that apart from Him, we can do nothing (John 15:5). Instead, we will struggle to build false kingdoms of our own that won’t last and will never fulfill. But thanks be to God, whose plans can never be thwarted! Like the apostles, may we seek to obey Him, rather than man.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Wilbert\n\nText: Acts 6:1-15, Genesis 4:3-7, 1 Timothy 3:8-13, Exodus 34:29-30\n\nWe can disavow the prosperity gospel with our words but still believe it in our hearts. We shake our fists at God, saying, “I did what you told me to and this is how you repay me?” I’ve done this a time or two in my life and am guilty of doing it again as recently as this morning. \n\nStephen was a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit (Acts 6:8). He reminds me of a few other men who came before him: Abraham, Noah, Job—men the Bible tells us were full of faith and for whom things went terribly wrong. I sometimes wonder if being “full of faith” is a prerequisite for all sorts of calamity. Not exactly the way we were told it would turn out, though, right?\n\nCome to Jesus and the things of earth will grow strangely dim.\n\nCome to Jesus and He’ll make your life better.\n\nCome to Jesus and His beautiful plan for your life.\n\nThese are true things, but the caveat to the clause should read something like this: \n\nCome to Jesus, die, and then be raised to life with Him eternal. \n\nComing to Jesus involves a death of self we’d often rather forget. \n\nDid Stephen know this when his name was counted among the first deacons of the early Church? Being full of faith and the Holy Spirit, did he know he’d be arrested just a few short verses later? \n\nCome to Jesus, display His fruit, and stand before the council for your stoning!\n\nI’ve spent a good portion of my Christian life in pursuit of the faith, grace, and power the Holy Spirit brings. I’d be just fine with being known as “that girl”—the one full of faith. But I now know enough about suffering that, as I stand before the council of the world, I’m unsure and wobbly, shaky and fearful. I’ve disavowed the prosperity gospel, yet I’ve believed it all the same. Do this, be like this, follow this, and it will always go well for you. Yes, but… well, what about when it doesn’t? \n\nGod was not in the debt of a man like Stephen or anyone else. It was Stephen—the servant and deacon who performed great wonders in His name—who was indebted to God. We get this backwards all too often. We center our energies on what God owes us, center our beliefs on what we’ve done for Him. While He is a good, faithful, kind, and generous God, He’s no puppet on the strings of our whims. \n\nGod was with Stephen there, in the place of his arrest, before the appointing of his death, and Acts 6:15 tells us, “They saw his face was like the face of an angel.” There’s a certain type of unshakeable peace for those who are the true servants of God, and Stephen knew this before he ever opened his mouth to speak. His peace wasn’t a peace the world could give, and it wasn’t something he could conjure up himself. It was the peace of God, given to a servant of God. \n\nThere is peace for the one who knows there is no bargaining with the God of the universe. \n\nBe full of faith, friends, and full of the Holy Spirit, grace, and power. Do mighty wonders in His name (Psalm 77:14). But do not fear or be surprised when you’re called before the council, when hard things happen, calamity occurs, and difficulties rise. There is a good and strange peace for you there. \n\nWe serve a God whose actions do not depend on our goodness. Let us praise Him for it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: Acts 7:1-53, Genesis 15:13-14, Deuteronomy 18:15\n\nDragged before the Sanhedrin, Stephen’s platform was a courtroom packed with men determined to put an end to the shockwaves caused by Christ’s resurrection. He’d endured a trial shored up by false witnesses and fabricated stories. And now, staring down the barrel of a trumped-up guilty verdict, perhaps knowing he’d be sentenced to death for his faith, Stephen went for the spiritual jugular. \n\n“Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They even killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become. You received the law under the direction of angels and yet have not kept it.”\n\n-Acts 7:52-53\n\nStanding before them, Stephen mapped out the long history of idol worship among the Jews. He didn’t have to bribe witnesses or plant evidence to prove that God’s people chronically looked to idols instead of turning to the one true God. The Jews were prone to put their hope in: \n\nTheir promised land instead of the God who created it (vv. 2-3).\n\nTheir house of worship instead of the intended object of worship (vv. 43).\n\nTheir law instead of the God who handed it down (vv. 53). \n\nWhen we look at Scripture through a rearview mirror, it’s easy to adopt a posture of chronological snobbery. We read stories like Stephen’s and see the religious leaders through the lens of “us vs. them.” They are the villains of the New Testament. Perhaps when we read Stephen’s sermon, we imagine ourselves in his place, preaching our guts out for the glory of God. But it’s good to remember that we could easily swap places with the judges who condemned him to death.  \n\nIdols have a gravitational pull on our hearts too. There is a tendency among God’s people in every generation to worship something or someone other than the one true God. And we still have a nasty habit of throwing stones toward those who remind us that our own idol worship is futile and sinful. \n\nBut read Stephen’s sermon again. Let it marinate. Stephen’s words map out Israel’s rebellions, but there’s a parallel trajectory telling the story of God’s remarkable faithfulness. \n\nHe was faithful to Abraham, and to Joseph, too (vv. 2-6, 9-10).\n\nHe never turned His back on Jacob, the deceiver (vv. 12-16).\n\nHe remained with Moses (vv. 17-36).\n\nThe Israelites may have rejected their human leader as they wandered around in the desert, but God never did. He never has. He never will. \n\nStephen was sharing this key truth with the Sanhedrin: all of humanity—every last one of us—is prone to reject God’s gifts and worship idols instead, prone to hide from the God who made us. That’s been true in every generation since the Garden of Eden.\n\nBefore a call to repentance pierced our own hearts, we also rejected the Truth that Jesus is the Promised Savior we desperately need. But even so, God is faithful and merciful in every season. Therefore, we ought to repent and believe, because Jesus, the Righteous One, was murdered to pay the penalty for all our sins for all time.\n\nOur hope is built on Christ alone—not land, or temples, or laws. The religious leaders may have covered their ears and tried not to listen, but they couldn’t change the truth Stephen died telling: God is faithful. He was with Stephen that day, and He is present with us now. Looking back we see His grace and forgiveness. Looking forward we see His coming rescue.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nText: Acts 7:54-60, Acts 8:1-40, 2 Kings 2:11, Isaiah 56:3-5\n\nAt this point in the book of Acts, God’s Spirit is moving and empowering the members of the early Church to emulate the gospel-bellowing boldness of Peter. They’re fleshing out the declarative promise of Jesus at the beginning of this New Testament story: \n\n“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.”\n\n-Acts 1:8 ESV (emphasis mine)\n\nAlthough not everyone they witnessed to was so receptive. In his final sermon before the Sanhedrin, Stephen rebuked their stubbornness before God, and he condemned their murdering of Jesus, the Promised Messiah. Being confronted with these truths, the leaders became infuriated, ultimately murdering him as well (Acts 7:51-60). \n\nStephen, likely a relatively new Christ-follower, was also was one of seven men the apostles had chosen to manage and allocate charitable giving, because there’d been some fussing about how some of the needy folks were getting more financial assistance than others. So they chose a few good men (which many congregations now refer to as deacons) to sort it all out (Acts 6:1-4). \n\nTherefore, it stands to reason that Stephen, being a chosen member of the very first deaconate, was a wise, honorable, well-liked kind of guy. And we know for sure that he was passionate about the gospel because Luke literally describes him as “a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit” (Acts 6:5). \n\nSo it’s not hard to imagine the collective shock and grief that rippled through that neophyte church community when he was stoned to death by a militant, anti-Christian mob, simply because of one straightforward sermon about their generational stubborn streak and desperate need for Jesus.\n\nHumanly speaking, it would’ve made sense for the early Church to recoil and then retreat after the tragedy of their dear friend’s gruesome murder. It would make sense if they’d chosen to circle their proverbial wagons and focus on consoling the core group of their fellowship—maybe hire a grief counselor, a crisis manager, and some administrative help to wade through all the insurance and liability issues. \n\nBut they didn’t shrink back in fear. They didn’t go underground and become a secret, self-protective, cultish kind of crew. They didn’t allow a horrific homicide to curb their cause. Nope. They did the exact opposite. \n\nOn that day the church of Jerusalem began to be persecuted, and all the believers, except the apostles, were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. And some religious people buried Stephen and cried loudly for him. Saul was also trying to destroy the church, going from house to house, dragging out men and women and putting them in jail. And wherever they were scattered, they told people the Good News.\n\n-Acts 7:51-8:4 NCV (emphasis mine)\n\nTheir commitment to love others for the sake of Christ didn’t get buried with Stephen—it rose up and got bigger! The enemy’s knock-out punch didn’t send them reeling to the canvas; it propelled them out to share the gospel in every corner of the world.\n\nHere’s the ironic thing about hardship: it tends to have the reverse effect on those of us who’ve put our hope in Jesus rather than in our circumstances. Instead of staying down when we’re walloped, God’s people tend to bounce back with more oomph. In fact, church history proves that opposition often works like Miracle Gro on the Body of Christ. The power of the Holy Spirit enables us to have Rocky-like comebacks, pointing to the undefeatable, redemptive power of the Gospel. We may be down, but we’re never out.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Acts 9:1-31, Galatians 1:11-16, 2 Corinthians 3:12-13\n\nCan you imagine if Paul had not done what God called him to do? If he’d had the show-stopping, life-altering moment on the road to Damascus and then went home and holed up, instead of spreading the gospel fervently to the nations? Paul’s miraculous conversion ordained by God would have gone no further than Paul. He himself would have been saved, but what about the countless others he would go on to meet, as well as those of us who read his words today?\n\nPaul had excuses to shrink back and hide away. As soon as he was converted, his ministry was met with opposition. His former cohorts, the Jews, conspired to kill him (Acts 9:23), and his new tribe, Jesus’ disciples, were afraid of him (Acts 9:26).\n\nMy (recovering) people-pleasing heart and I would have had a hard time with this. Whenever I am taking the first shaky steps toward something God has called me to do, it is always the opinions of those closest to me that can make or break me. If they hesitate, or question, or pose all-out opposition, I begin to question what the Lord said. Wait, God, did you really want me to do this? Because so-and-so says this, and so-and-so thinks that… \n\nWe don’t see this type of hesitation in Paul. In fact, we see the opposite. Scripture says Paul immediately began preaching the name of Jesus in the synagogues (Acts 9:20), the very place he once condemned believers and the very place his old buddies hung around. We also read that he preached boldly (v. 28)—as opposed to me, who would have been afraid for my own life, fearfully whispering over and over again the words of what others thought of me. \n\nIf Paul were reading this today, he’d be quick to point out that it wasn’t Paul who made Paul bold. In his letter to the Galatians, he says, “I no longer live, but Christ in me” (Galatians 2:20). It wasn’t Paul’s boldness that set him apart; it was Christ in him who set Paul apart and promised to complete a mighty work in him (Philippians 1:6).\n\nI love what Paul says about conversion in his first letter to the Thessalonians: “For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, in the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance” (1:5). When we believe in Christ, it’s not just a cognitive shift. It’s a full-body, full-heart shift. We are changed completely, as we see in the complete 180 Jesus made in Paul’s heart.\n\nThis truth—that we have the power of the Holy Spirit—is a game-changer when it comes to taking those first shaky steps into ministry and into calling. For if we have the same Holy Spirit that Paul had, whose opinions do we have to fear? What opposition can make us crumble? What power can come against the power that lives inside of us? \n\nSure, we may not always have people cheering us on from the sidelines, but we will always have the Holy Spirit in us, giving us the strength and assurance we need to keep going.\n\nLet’s Praise God for this today—for the grace of His Son, the power of His Spirit, and the promise to complete the good work He began in us, by no power of our own.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: Acts 9:32-43, Mark 5:21-43, Psalm 36:8-9\n\nYears ago, after returning from a mission trip, I joined my church staff for lunch to share my experiences. As I described some patients we’d met while visiting an infirmary, I noticed my tablemates shifting uncomfortably in their seats. I couldn’t blame them. I pushed my plate away, my appetite dissolved in the memory of such deep and devastating need. \n\nWhen faced with the reality of true abject poverty, my instinct is to look away. I’ll never be able to unsee the sick and dying, lying in beds crammed ten to a room, but deep down I don’t want to. Witnessing that cloud of suffering has helped me to see God’s rich mercy and compassion with greater clarity. \n\nIn Acts 9, we meet two people in desperate need of such mercy. Their stories reflect the realities I saw in a third world infirmary and the suffering I see all around me when I force my eyes to look up. The first is Aeneas, a paralytic who’d been bedridden for eight years (v. 33). The second is Dorcas, a disciple of Christ and vibrant member of the Church who’d fallen ill and died (vv. 36-37). Their two stories illustrate a stark juxtaposition. \n\nAeneas was from Lydda, a pagan settlement filled with blue-collar workers.\n\nDorcas lived in Joppa, a beautiful and thriving port city with a long Jewish history.\n\nAeneas had been bedridden for nearly a decade.\n\nDorcas had lived a vibrant life of service before becoming sick and dying unexpectedly.\n\nAeneas had nothing to offer, no good works to give, as she’d been immobilized.\n\nDorcas was “full of good works and acts of charity” (v. 36).\n\nYet, by the power of Christ, both of them were fully healed. \n\nThere are ugly corners of my sinful heart that think healing can be earned, that God’s touch is reserved for the deserving. I see the reality of my own brokenness and worry He’ll turn away from my need. But the contrast between these two miracles proves that Christ’s compassion is not dependent upon our deservedness.\n\nOver and over again during His earthly ministry, and later through His disciples, Jesus offered healing to people on every rung of the social and economic ladder. Each miraculous encounter shows us that His grace is a free gift, extended to both the greatest and least of us. We can’t twist God’s arm to make Him intervene in our lives. Nor can our good works or earthly belongings offer Him anything in return. His work in our lives is always an outflow of His mercy and grace. \n\nAeneas and Dorcas were tied together by a God who saw their suffering and refused to look away. Their stories remind me that I can ask for God’s help and expect Him to respond based on His character, not my merit. He shows compassion to me, not because of what I deserve, but because of who He is. \n\nLet us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\n\n-Hebrews 4:16\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Good News for the Gentiles",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Acts 10:1-48, Isaiah 52:7-10, Galatians 3:13\n\nThe gospel is for everyone. Thanks be to God. \n\nEven when we aren’t sure it can extend to cover our sins.\n\nEven when we want to keep it just for ourselves like Jonah.\n\nEven when we cannot imagine it being powerful enough to cover the wickedness of the world.\n\nChrist died for the world and ascended into heaven, leaving His disciples with a command to preach His gospel to all people. \n\nToday’s passage is deeply significant to us as believers. It is the moment in church history—in world history—when God makes plain to both Jews and Gentiles that we “should not call any person common or unclean” (Acts 10:28) as “God shows no partiality” among those who fear Him (Acts 10:34).\n\nThis is the moment that allows us to trace our fingers across the pages of our Bibles to see God’s gospel plan throughout, beginning with the Abrahamic Covenant in Genesis, where God “brought [Abram] outside and said, ‘Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them… So shall your offspring be’” (Genesis 15:5). \n\nAs our fingers follow the hand of God across centuries and generations, tabernacles and temples, kings and kingdoms, we stop here at this moment in Acts chapter 10—where the children of Abraham grow exponentially to “sand and stars” status—when God extends His family of sons and daughters to every kindred, tribe, and nation. \n\nHis long-ago promise of “I will be your God and you will be My people” (Exodus 6:7), which was once kept for the Jewish nation only, is now made available to all, the entire world, making “no distinction.” Repentance is now for everyone. \n\nDo you see it, too? God’s covenant to Abraham is fulfilled in the new covenant by Christ’s blood, right here in black and white, in the pages of His Word (Luke 22:20).\n\nOf course, God operates in significance, and this moment is no exception. From Acts chapter 1 until chapter 10—from Christ’s Great Commission to Peter’s vision—there were exactly three categories of people: Jews (God’s holy nation), Gentiles (anyone who wasn’t a Jew), and converted Gentiles (non-Jews who believed in the gospel of Jesus).\n\nHis invitation of life to the rest of the world was significantly personal. He did not send a Jew to tell the Gentiles they’d been grafted into God’s plan (Romans 11:11-31); He sent one of His own angels to appear to the newly converted Cornelius, a Gentile. Only then—a day later—did He send an angel to appear to Peter with the official word that from that point on, “God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him” (Acts 10:34).\n\nIt was a meeting arranged by God. He gave Peter the message to share and Cornelius ears to hear it. He made sure both of His sons knew they were both equally His, that there was no longer any distinction or need for categories. No matter Jew or Gentile, we who believe are now all sons and daughters of Abraham.  \n\nPerhaps you haven’t looked at it this way before. Perhaps you’ve forgotten that you, too, “were once far off” (Ephesians 2:13). But now because of Jesus, “God has granted repentance that leads to life” for all who believe (Acts 11:18).\n\nHe has granted us repentance. It is a gift, an invitation to bow before Him and not be called common. An invitation to repent and to be forgiven. To be called sons and daughters of Abraham—sons and daughters of God Himself. Thanks be to God, indeed.\n\n“The Lord has displayed his holy arm in the sight of all the nations;\n\nall the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.”\n\nIsaiah 52:10\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Acts 11:1-30, 1 Peter 4:16-19, Romans 15:25-28\n\nI slinked into my church’s Saturday night service and quietly sat in a row near the back. It had been a hard week, and I wanted to be alone. With a quick glance, I saw a few people I knew scattered about the room. It would have been good for me to stick around and chat with them, but instead I left after the closing prayer and sat in my car. Alone. \n\nThis is often my default when things get hard: be by myself, pray, journal, figure it out. It might be your default, too, and that would be understandable since we’re both living in a culture that promotes individualism and a DIY attitude toward all things. \n\nI don’t know the origin of this isolating cultural perspective, but I know it wasn’t learned from the book of Acts. In this chronicle of the early Church, we’ve read story after story of unity and togetherness. Scripture tells us “all the believers were together and held all things in common,” that they “were of one heart and mind” (Acts 2:44; 4:32).\n\nActs 11 carries on this unity theme, first with Peter defending the Gentiles. To say a Gentile could also be saved and receive the Holy Spirit was a big deal at the time. Until then, only Jews were considered candidates for Christianity; so letting Gentiles into the club was sort of like letting freshmen on the varsity team without a try-out. You just don’t do that. But Jesus did. \n\nAfter listening to Peter’s defense, the skeptics responded, saying, “So God has granted repentance resulting in life even to the Gentiles!” (Acts 11:18). Here we see the Church embracing the outsider in the name of Christ. In Jesus, salvation was—and is—offered to all, regardless of our labels.\n\nNext, we hear about the revival at Antioch. The number of conversions was so great that Barnabas went searching for his buddy Paul for help. At Antioch, they labored together for an entire year. Barnabas could have manned the Antioch church by himself, but he pulled in a friend to be with him on the journey. The disciples knew that ministry together was better than ministry alone. \n\nFinally, we get to the part that is my personal favorite, where believers are united not only in deed, but also in name as the term “Christian” is introduced (Acts 11:26). Before any other title we may hold—Jew, Gentile, mother, daughter, sister, friend, co-worker—is this one: Christian. It sets us apart as believers in the death and resurrection of Christ. Even stronger than a bloodline, is the Christ-line we all share. It is what makes the Church body a family. \n\nI thought of this while I was sitting in my car, in the church parking lot, alone. A building full of family sat in front of me, yet I was operating like the Lone Ranger. I had forgotten that the purpose of the Church is to do what Barnabas did at Antioch: “He encouraged all of them to remain true to the Lord with a firm resolve of the heart” (Acts 11:23). I had forgotten that salvation was for all weary sinners and I was welcome here, even on my worst days.\n\nSo I did what was not in my nature to do—I reached out to the Body, in the form of a group text. Thirty minutes later, I was sitting with friends, eating chips and guacamole. I shared a little and laughed a lot, and I was reminded that we were never meant to do this alone, that believers are united by an unbreakable thread in Christ. Before we are anything else we are Christians, and that makes us more than friends. That makes us family. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Acts 12:1-25, Mark 10:35-40, Isaiah 42:8\n\nPeter’s position seemed dire. He was in prison and scheduled for execution the following day (Acts 12:6). But I love the response of the Church here; they didn’t start a letter-writing campaign, or stage a protest—they gathered together to pray. And after they gathered together, instead of just angrily shouting about what to do next, they actually prayed.\n\nThis was their solution to an impossible situation. God was teaching His people what it means to be the Church. He was teaching them—and us—how to solve impossible problems. The answer is simply this: pray. It’s such a simple answer that they found it hard to believe it would actually work. They were surprised when Peter showed up at the door with the shackles off his hands (Acts 12:6-16).\n\nGod is so abundantly good, sometimes we don’t even see it. When He moves in a direct response to prayer we are inclined to miss it; we’d never dare to dream that His goodness extends far enough to answer our requests. In fact, sometimes we forget to pray at all!\n\nWhat if God uses pain to draw us to Him? It’s possible that dangers and struggles come to drive the Church to prayer—not because He needs us to pray, and not because He needs us to give glory to Him, but because He’s turning our gaze back toward Him. Surely, God’s glory and purposes aren’t subject to what we do or don’t do. In his book The Problem of Pain, C.S. Lewis put it this way: “For you will certainly carry out God’s purpose, however you act, but it makes a difference to you whether you serve like Judas or like John.”\n\nGod uses trials to bring us to prayer—to change us. He calls us to do His work, and sometimes that work feels impossible. Unthinkable things happen to us, marriages fail, parents get sick, our sweet new babies die—our hearts are broken. But we are not called to despair, or even to fear (Isaiah 41:10), because it’s in the places of deep darkness that God does His greatest work.\n\nLet us join with the saints of the early Church and use every hardship as an occasion to pray. We, too, can believe in God’s abundant goodness, and see how the gospel can flourish and multiply (Acts 12:24), even in times of persecution. \n\nAre you hurting today? Are you mourning the loss of the life you imagined? Does it seem like there is no solution, no hope? You are not alone. Receive that: you are not alone. Let your sadness, hurt, and despair prompt you to pray. \n\nGod is at work, even when we struggle to believe. \n\n",

Paul and Barnabas knew what was at stake and that at any moment their lives could be taken from them. But God had given them a task: to preach the good news of Jesus Christ to the nations. \n\nWhat an emotional roller coaster they must have experienced those few weeks in Pisidian Antioch. One week they proclaimed the truth that Jesus is the promised Messiah, and the people were receptive to their message. So much so, they invited Paul and Barnabas to speak again. I envision Paul and Barnabas as they headed away from the crowd, jumping for joy and praising God for the incredible response from that day. \n\nThe next week, the whole city turned out to hear the word of the Lord (Acts 13:44). Can you imagine? It must have been so encouraging for Paul and Barnabas to realize the part they were playing in spreading the message of Christ. \n\nBut then it happened. The Jews became filled with jealousy (Acts 13:45). They began to oppose Paul and Barnabas and their message. \n\nThis wasn’t the first time Paul and Barnabas had faced opposition to the gospel message (Acts 9:29). Had they given up at the first sign of trouble, they would have missed out on participating in the incredible work God was doing in spreading the good news.\n\nPaul and Barnabas were able to withstand the emotional highs and lows they faced throughout their ministry because they were resolved in their task, and they knew God was with them. They were confident God had called them to preach the message of Christ to the Gentiles. Regardless of what happened, they would do their very best to remain faithful. \n\nGod has given all of us tasks as well. He has placed them on each of our hearts and calls us to complete them. Maybe it’s a short-term task, changing daily. Or maybe it’s long-term, spanning the days and weeks and months ahead. \n\nWhatever our unique calling, God doesn’t expect our perfection, but He does desire our faithfulness. As God used Paul and Barnabas to proclaim the truth of Scripture to the people in Pisidian Antioch, He has called each of us to be part of His saving work on this earth. \n\nEven so, the outcome is not up to us. Paul and Barnabas were faithful. They may have felt like they had failed when the Jews rejected their message. But in His sovereignty, God used what seemed like failure to bring many Gentiles to Himself. \n\nFriends, let us keep pressing on. Let us aim to be faithful to God’s calling, and learn to let go of our own expectations for perfection. We can rest easy in this truth: we are ultimately not responsible for the outcome of our efforts. That lies in the hands of our incredibly powerful and overwhelmingly sovereign God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessie Minassian\n\nText: Acts 14:1-28, 2 Timothy 3:10-12, Colossians 4:2-4\n\nI have a friend who understands the illusion of fame well. \n\nOne summer, he was on stage in front of thousands of teens. As he walked behind a group of girls before a performance, he overheard them talking about how much they loved him. In a bold move, he approached the girls and entered into a conversation with them. Realizing they didn’t recognize him, he even offered to introduce them to that “guy on stage.” They giggled and talked excitedly, never knowing they had just been talking to the “star” himself. \n\nIt’s part of human nature to look up to those we admire. Obviously, that’s not all bad, but we can easily inflate and blow that admiration out of proportion. Paul and Barnabas learned this lesson nearly two thousand years ago.\n\nThey were empowered by the Holy Spirit; their words were eloquent and cut to the heart. Scripture tells us that when Paul and Barnabas preached, they “spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed” (Acts 14:1). They were certainly well-known, and in today’s culture we might even say they’d grown “famous.” And like most prominent people, they evoked two common—though extreme and unhealthy—responses: they were either loved or hated.\n\nWe see the first example of this in Iconium. The Jews were piping mad at the apostles’ powerful message. In response, they made personal attacks, threatened physical violence, and stirred up as much trouble as they possibly could (Acts 14:2). \n\nBut the people of Lystra had a different destructive response to Paul and Barnabas: they went absolutely gaga for them! The people were so taken with the message they preached that they began to idolize them. I know—garlands and animal sacrifice sound a bit extreme (Acts 14:18), but don’t let their pagan cultural response blind you to the modern implications. \n\nThink about the famous teachers of our time. More often than not, they teach—verbally or through written word—in ways that move us deeply and stir our hearts toward God. We are drawn to gifted teachers and come to admire, respect, and learn from them. But because of our sin nature, we’re also tempted to idolize them.\n\nAs for Paul and Barnabas, they weren’t having it. The apostles refused to receive the people’s misplaced accolades. \n\n“Men! Why are you doing these things? We are men also, with the same nature as you, and we are proclaiming good news to you, that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and everything in them.”\n\n-Acts 14:15\n\nWe will always be tempted to worship gifted people with powerful messages. So we must guard our hearts against worshiping the messenger instead of the God to whom we all belong. At the end of the day, the gospel will flourish because of Him, just as it thrived in those early days of the Church. \n\nThat’s what I love most about the close of Acts 14. Despite the misguided responses of Jews and Gentiles alike, the good news was preached, and souls were added to the Kingdom. God can and will use the power of earthly fame for His purposes, but He alone is worthy of our praise and adoration.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Is Christ Enough?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nText: Acts 15:1-35, Romans 2:17-24, Galatians 5:1\n\nThose first Jewish individuals who converted to Christianity were initially a bunch of scrupulous rule-followers. It’s no wonder they were having a hard time with the fraternity of Gentile converts, who’d seemingly sailed in from a laissez-faire, lawless background without “earning” the grace of God they were now reveling in. \n\nAnd so, the Jewish Christians decided to erect a hierarchical ladder with a few more steps leading to redemption (Acts 15:1-6). They adapted the “Faith in Jesus + Nothing = Salvation” message that Peter, Stephen, and Paul had preached, into a “Faith in Jesus + A More Restrictive Menu and Circumcision = Salvation” lecture. I imagine they secretly surmised it was a harmless enough edit.\n\nI mean, we aren’t expecting non-Jews to adhere to all 613 Torah rules or anything—just the biggies. All they have to do is order their steaks medium-well and agree to get their private parts tweaked a bit. That’s just a teensy outpatient surgery. Heck, we’ll even pay for the ice packs!       \n\nThis prejudiced-based friction between Jews and Greeks—officially titled “The Jerusalem Debate”—endangered the fellowship of the early Church. It caused such a rift in Antioch that Paul and Barnabas left, traveling back to Jerusalem to sort the matter out with the rest of the elders and apostles. Imagine the murmurs of differing opinions rippling through the multi-ethnic congregation of our mother Church when Peter stood up to address them:\n\n“Brothers, you know that in the early days God chose me from among you to preach the Good News to the nations. They heard the Good News from me, and they believed. God, who knows the thoughts of everyone, accepted them. He showed this to us by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us. To God, those people are not different from us. When they believed, he made their hearts pure. So now why are you testing God by putting a heavy load around the necks of the non-Jewish believers? It is a load that neither we nor our ancestors were able to carry. But we believe that we and they too will be saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus.”\n\n-Acts 15:7-11 (NCV)\n\nThe first point Peter argues is that the gospel they’d been preaching (Faith in Jesus + Nothing = Salvation) had already resulted in an international harvest of salvation. Obviously, the Holy Spirit was able to soften sinners’ hearts unto repentance without first whacking them over the head with a 50-pound rulebook. The testimony of Jesus Christ crucified and resurrected was perfectly sufficient to compel the lost to find their living hope in Him. \n\nI bet most of the men listening to Peter argue his case were now dumbfounded, slack-jawed with the realization that he’d just nailed them to the wall with his observation: the weight of the law almost broke your back, so why in the world are you so determined to strap it on someone else’s shoulders?     \n\nHere’s the deal about the judgment God declared as a result of humanity’s sin against Him (Romans 3:23): WE CAN NEVER BEHAVE WELL ENOUGH TO SATISFY IT. We can’t get good enough. No matter how many biblical rules we’re able to keep, it’s impossible for humans to attain perfection, and perfection is the only remedy for God’s wrath. This is why He sent His only begotten Son into the world, wrapped in a suit of skin: to live a perfect sinless life and shed His perfect blood during a sacrificial death, making perfect atonement for our sin. \n\nJesus is the only One who could justify us and reconcile us into a right relationship with our heavenly Father. If we could close the gap with God ourselves, Jesus could’ve just kept chilling out in Glory and skipped the whole sordid “Redeeming Mankind” mission.    \n\nThe Mosaic Law these well-intentioned Jewish Christians were so eager to push onto the Gentiles never had the power to save anyone. That wasn’t God’s intention when He gave it to Moses in the first place. God didn’t proclaim those commandments on that ancient pinnacle so that by them we could be saved. He gave them so we’d realize we can’t save ourselves! \n\nThe Old Testament moral and ceremonial stipulations underscore our absolute inability to achieve perfection. They were always, always, always meant to lead us to Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Start of the Second Missionary Journey",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nText: Acts 15:36-41, Acts 16:1-15, John 15:26, 1 Corinthians 9:19-21\n\nIf you’ve been a Christian for any length of time, you’ve probably heard countless stories of rifts, splits, and politics in the Church. Maybe you or someone close to you has been really hurt by the way the imperfect people of the Church handled certain situations. It’s devastating when God’s people let their flaws get in the way of ministry, doing more harm than good.\n\nHowever, the Church is sometimes so afraid of discord that it swings too far the other way. Trying to maintain the unity Christians are called to (1 Peter 3:8), we can unintentionally create cultures that stifle any questioning or difference of opinion. The push for unity can be taken so far that it seems sinful to disagree at all. There must be a better solution to preventing the type of pain that church conflict is known to cause.\n\nThe struggle of Christians to balance unity with uniqueness is nothing new. In Acts, we read about the ministry of Paul and Barnabas, two exceptional men who gave their lives to preaching the gospel. But even these god-fearing men had a sharp disagreement. Barnabas wanted to bring Mark with them on their journey, but Paul didn’t think it would be wise, given that Mark had ditched them on a past journey. \n\nThere doesn’t seem to be a moral issue here, just a difference of opinion or perhaps a difference in what these men felt God was calling them to do. Barnabas was thinking about his cousin, and Paul was thinking about the dangers ahead. Even though the men decided to part ways, this story doesn’t paint either man as a villain. \n\nIt is so rare for us to view a disagreement like this without assigning blame to one party or the other. Surely someone is in the wrong! That was my reaction when I first read this story of Paul and Barnabas. But the more I dug, the more I found that most scholars don’t see a moral issue in the way these two godly men disagreed and parted.\n\nWhile it might not have been ideal for Paul and Barnabas to be on different pages, God used their parting of ways to reach more people and spread the gospel. In the end, their disagreement does not lead to a damaged relationship, nor do they appear to hold any ill will toward one another. In fact, Paul goes on to later speak very respectfully of Mark, calling him a fellow worker who had brought him comfort (Colossians 4:10-11). \n\nSometimes there is unavoidable pain from conflict because one or both parties are in the wrong, acting out of sin. Those situations are distinctly different in nature from the disagreement we here see between Paul and Barnabas. \n\nTheir conflict affirms that we can disagree and even be angry without sinning (Ephesians 4:26), if we do it with a gentle and humble spirit. We can part ways when needed without hurting others, if we understand that there does not always have to be a villain. Conflict can feel yucky, but in non-moral issues such as this, God can use it for His good purposes.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: Acts 16:16-40, 2 Corinthians 10:3-4, 1 Peter 2:19-21\n\nLocked in prison and bound in chains, Paul and Silas make strange poster boys for freedom. When we conjure up images of freedom, we are more likely to picture an eagle in flight or a child running uninhibited through a field, than to picture two fellas in a shared prison cell. But make no mistake, even in prison, Paul and Silas were free. Their story reminds us that when God’s people live as though they’re free, the shock waves of radical faith radiate out into the world.\n\nIf you’re someone who likes to underline (or circle, doodle beside, or watercolor), grab your Bible and pen or paintbrush, and get to work highlighting verse 25: \n\n“About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.”\n\n-Acts 16:25\n\nPaul and Silas had been arrested for disturbing the peace, and were then dragged into the marketplace where they were stripped and beaten with rods. Their response? They had church.\n\nThere simply wasn’t a dungeon dark enough to snuff out their status as the “light of the world” (Matthew 5:14). No earthly shackles could compare to the chains of sin Christ died to free them from. The key had been turned on the cages of death and condemnation, and no prison sentence could strip them of that freedom. Though imprisoned, they chose to live out the message of that favorite children’s song, “Hide it under a bushel? No! I’m gonna let it shine.” The prisoners in chains all around them couldn’t help but listen in. \n\nI can’t get enough of the jailer’s conversion from this passage. This man who held the keys to an earthly prison exchanged them for the keys to the Kingdom of heaven (Matthew 16:19). What a beautiful picture of the gospel!\n\nAs the earth shook beneath him and the prison doors flew open, perhaps he saw his own chains for the first time. When God’s people live freely, those in bondage all around us are moved to look at their own chains and repeat the jailer’s question:\n\n“What must I do to be saved?”\n\n-Acts 16:30\n\nDon’t miss this! If we are in Christ, we are free indeed (John 8:36).  \n\nFree from the law of sin and death (Romans 8:2).\n\nFree from the enslaving weight of sin (Galatians 5:1).\n\nFree from the bondage of corruption (Romans 8:21).\n\nFree from eternal condemnation (Romans 8:1).   \n\nJesus is the great abolitionist. From the cross, He shook the foundations of our prison cells and flung open the doors to our hearts, freeing the bound and enslaved so that we might freely live. \n\n“For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.”\n\n-Galatians 5:1\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellie Holcomb\n\nText: Acts 17:1-34, Zechariah 12:10, Romans 3:21-26\n\nI’ve read Acts many times before, but something changed for me as I was preparing to write this. The She Reads Team suggested that, in addition to reading through the whole book of Acts, we might want to listen through the whole book as well. (There are tons of free ways to do this online. Try it!) I’d never thought to do it before, but it was remarkable. \n\nAs I simply listened to the story Paul was so adamant in telling—of his conversion, Jesus’ resurrection from the dead, and the crazy beautiful way God brought Jews and Gentiles together with the gospel of good news—I was transported from my own story and swept up into God’s. And like Paul, it made me want to share the gospel.\n\nIn Acts 17, we see that Paul continues to look for any opportunity to share the gospel of the resurrected Jesus. But while in Athens, he is greatly troubled to find that the city is full of idols.  \n\n“…as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.”\n\n-Acts 17:23\n\nI had to press pause on my phone. The phrase, “I looked carefully at your objects of worship” echoed in my heart. \n\nI don’t have images in silver or gold placed throughout my house that I treat as idols, but I was so convicted as Paul spoke about worshiping an unknown god. I thought about how many things I’ve tried to replace the love of God with in my life, and I began to ask the Lord if there were currently any unknown gods I’ve been worshiping. \n\nThat’s where it began… a “re-ordering of the loves” in my heart, as Augustine called it. As of late, I’ve been searching for my worth in the way that I perform as a mom, as a daughter, and as a friend. I measure how much I matter by what other people think about me or by how they respond to me. And once again, I am so deeply convicted of ascribing more worth to what others think of me than to what God thinks of me—of what He has done for me. \n\nI feel it deep in my bones, the discontent that comes when I look to anything other than Jesus for my identity and happiness. Tim Keller says it like this: “Disordered love always leads to misery and breakdown. The only way to reorder our loves is to love God supremely.” Loving Him first is the only way (John 14:6).\n\nPaul goes on to proclaim to the Athenians the beautiful truth about our God:\n\nHe “made the world and everything in it” (v. 24).\n\nHe “gives everyone life and breath and all things” (v. 25).\n\n“He is not far from each one of us,” for it’s in Him that we live (v. 27-28).\n\nHe counts us as His children (v. 29).\n\nThis is the God Paul points us to. May we learn to love Him supremely and find sweet satisfaction in His grace.\n\nFather, forgive us for worshiping false, even unknown, gods. By Your grace, please reveal them to us. Help us to shift our gaze from all the lesser loves to You, the One true lover of our souls. By your mercy, re-order our hearts as You see fit, and teach us to worship You alone. Amen.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nText: Acts 18:1-28, James 4:13-15, Isaiah 51:1-2\n\n“There’s nothing to be afraid of.”\n\nThey were lying. I had plenty to be afraid of.\n\nI had just climbed up a steep lakeside embankment with nothing more than a swimsuit, Chaco sandals, and the intent of jumping off a 50-foot cliff into the water. My brother and his best friend were doing all they could to convince me everything would be fine, that there was nothing to fear. \n\nWhat if I slip as I’m jumping and hit my head?\n\nWhat if I hit the water at a bad angle?\n\nWhat if this water isn’t as deep as we think it is?\n\nWhat if I land on a floating tree branch?\n\nFear. It’s a big deal. It can keep us from doing things we’d really like to do. It can also keep us from doing exactly what God has asked of us. It can even cause us to live our lives in ways that leave us no room for faith; we become so seemingly independent that we begin to believe we don’t need God or anyone else. \n\nI don’t know if you’re like me and have every “Do not fear” in the entire Bible circled, underlined, and highlighted. It makes sense to see it in the Old Testament, when the heroes of Israel are heading into battle. But Paul? Is this the same Paul who had already faced oppression, persecution, and imprisonment for the gospel? That Paul was afraid? \n\nThen the Lord said to Paul in a night vision, “Don’t be afraid, but keep on speaking and don’t be silent. For I am with you, and no one will lay a hand on you to hurt you, because I have many people in this city.”\n\n-Acts 18:9-10\n\nDo not be afraid. The Greek phrase used in verse 9 means “you must not be afraid any longer.” Literally, stop being afraid!\n\nThis is confirmation that yes, Paul was, in fact, already afraid. The text doesn’t give us much more context for Paul’s fear. Was his fear the “thorn in his flesh” that would always plague him (2 Corinthians 12)? Was this a one-time situation where he was especially afraid? The Jews had opposed him and abused him before, but that can’t be something one gets used to. \n\nRegardless of the details, we can be sure of one thing: Paul was afraid and God commanded him to not be afraid any longer. \n\nLike Paul, I’ve faced some crippling fears (yes, even more terrifying than that time I jumped off a cliff). God has called me to things and I’ve stood frozen, still paralyzed by a fear of failure or defeat. Instead of embracing the strength and victory He promises (1 Corinthians 15:57), I’ve let fear dictate what I believe and what I do. \n\nEven in the most intimidating situations, God is faithful. He gave Paul the assurance that He would protect him. Just look at how perfectly God provided for Paul: \n\nHe brought him fellowship and friendship with Aquila and Priscilla (Acts 18:18).\n\nHe provided for his physical needs, allowing him to continue working as a tentmaker (v. 3).\n\nHe allowed him to spread the gospel in Corinth for another year and a half (v. 11).\n\nOur God provides for us too. Despite the moments we feel crippled with fear, He knows exactly where we are and what we’re feeling. We can trust that God is bigger than all our fears. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Paul’s Third Missionary Journey",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: Acts 19:1-41, Luke 3:16, Ephesians 6:12\n\nI’ve been spending a lot of time in New York City lately, and I love it. People there are beautiful and stylish, moving at a pace that seems faster than humanly possible. You get the feeling that everyone is on an important mission, chasing their dream and making it happen. The energy is intoxicating. \n\nBut there’s also a sense that it’s all hanging in a very tight balance. Life in the commercial center of the world is expensive, fast, and hard. The margins are slim between living and not being able to make rent. That energy is fraught with anxiety, loneliness, and an underlying fear that it all could slip away.\n\nThis is the world Paul stepped into when he arrived in Ephesus. \n\nLocated in the far western corner of modern-day Turkey, Ephesus was the epicenter of the Mediterranean. The city’s theater had capacity for 25,000 people and the temple of the goddess Artemis towered over the city, nearly four times larger than the Parthenon in Athens. This was a place to see and be seen. A place to live your dreams. And Paul wasn’t just passing through; he moved in. \n\nUnlike his peers in the city, Paul had no economic agenda. Genuine and unassuming, he was a person people wanted to be around because he wasn’t there to leverage every relationship into a better job or status. He just wanted the Ephesians to know the Truth. It was only a matter of time before someone realized they were staring at a serious economic opportunity. \n\nSceva’s sons name-dropped with the best of them, hoping to ride Paul’s and Jesus’ momentum to fame and fortune. They were enamored with the miracles, but not with the One who made them possible. \n\nIn the oddest way, I love the evil spirits’ response to their half-hearted healing (Acts 19:14-15). Even demons believe in God and shudder (James 2:19), but speaking His name is powerless unless you truly know Him. \n\nAfter this violent encounter, a wellspring of believers realized their own mistake with the prosperity gospel. Convicted and impassioned to make a change, they made a public display of their repentance, setting aflame 50 thousand drachmas—the equivalent of 136 years’ worth of work. A huge portion of Ephesus’ GDP.\n\nClearly, that shift in values didn’t sit well with everyone in the city. As more Ephesians fell in love with Jesus, the silversmith, Demetrius feared for his livelihood, the future of the temple, and the future of his city. Perhaps he was driven by more than money, or maybe he wasn’t. Regardless, Demetrius chose to riot rather than repent. \n\nHaven’t we all? \n\nHas God ever messed with your economy? \n\nIt isn’t easy to let go of our jobs, our money, or our city. Those things feel like life. But God loves us too much to let money be our god, to let fame lure us away from Truth, or let us live a life of name-dropping, rather than heart-knowing. \n\nIs it possible that Jesus was calling Demetrius to abandon his meaningless silver souvenirs, into a more creative life? Did fear kidnap his chance to be the artist God created him to be?\n\nOne thing is certain. Jesus promises us a full, abundant life—greater than anything we can ask or imagine (Ephesians 3:20-21). His whisper is honest and true. There’s more, beloved. There’s more.\n\nIt waits for you on the other side of the fire.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Acts 20:1-38, 1 Corinthians 16:1-4, Philippians 1:20-21\n\nThe price we pay for the sun-drenched joys of summer camp are the sad farewells. I was seventeen and my legs were completely covered by bug bites, from my athletic sandals to my cuffed jean shorts. Bending over to scratch an ankle while Emily and I propped up the last of the mattresses in our cabin, I allowed myself a moment to peek into my sadness. Back at home, I was “Becky,” but at camp, I’d managed to introduce myself as “Rebecca,” and after a summer of feeling so grown up, I was sad to leave.\n\nEmily, sunburnt and still wearing a camp t-shirt, hugged me and said, “See you in heaven!” And she left. Just like that. I remember sitting alone in the fading light of our empty cabin, smelling the warm cedar and thinking, “See you in heaven?! Can she even say that to me?” It felt so final, and yet so hopeful. No one has said those words to me since, and I don’t think I’ll ever see Emily again, so she was probably right.\n\nHer words stuck with me, however, and when I read Paul’s lingering goodbyes to the Ephesians, I’m reminded of how hard it is for us to say our final farewells. Small things receive huge significance when they are the last things. Even the dust motes floating in the air, illuminated by shafts of sunlight, seem important in our last moments with those we love. \n\nSet in the context of eternity, all these things—all these moments—are the last things. My summer camp goodbyes are mostly forgotten, but that one reminded me that this world is passing away (1 Corinthians 7:31). Paul’s last address to the Ephesians invited them to see the world in the light of eternity, to make much of little things, because our goodbyes in this world are many and often.\n\nKnowing that none of them would ever see his face again, Paul slowed everything down to cry and savor their time together. Some of Paul’s last words to them were simple: \n\n“But I count my life of no value to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of God’s grace.”\n\n-Acts 20:24\n\nIn his final moments with dear friends, Paul wanted to speak to them about only the things that truly matter. Whether we die at the ripe old age of 110 or at breakfast tomorrow morning, these moments on earth are so dearly short compared to eternity. These sunlit days are brief and full of petite goodbyes. Paul uses these moments to commit his beloved friends “to God and to the message of His grace” (Acts 20:32).\n\nIn the midst of the sadness of all our goodbyes, the small and the huge farewells, God’s presence continues to go with both parties. When we are joined together in Christ, He promises that we will share an inheritance together in heaven (Romans 8:17). Indeed, we have His word that, “In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Acts 21:1-36, Joel 2:28-29, John 19:13-16\n\nYou know those movies with the sad endings you watch again and again? You know how they end, but something in you hopes beyond hope that somehow the ending will be different this time. The guy and the girl will get together. The epic battle scene will end in the good guy’s favor. But it never happens, does it? Because the ending has already been written.\n\nThis is how I feel when I enter the final chapters of Acts. I know Paul’s imprisonment is coming, but I want it to end differently this time. I want Paul to be free to bring the gospel everywhere and to everyone. When I read Acts 21, I don’t want that fateful day in the temple to come—the day that changed Paul’s course forever. For the remainder of the book, our friend is either in prison, en route to prison, or under house arrest. This is the last we see of Paul as a free man. \n\nWho hasn’t experienced a change of course? There we are, trucking along, doing fine and—BOOM—something happens that changes our direction. Something messes with the end of the story we’d planned for ourselves—an unexpected, and often unwanted, shift. \n\nWhen this happens to me, I look at God with shrugged shoulders. “What are You doing?” I ask. “Why is this happening? What now?” \n\nI’m not often given specific answers to these questions, but these shifts always remind me that God is the author of my story, not me. When I surrendered my life to Christ, I gave up ownership of myself (Galatians 2:19-20). I no longer call the shots, and a change of course is a good, though hard, reminder of this critical part of the Christian life.\n\nWhile we can’t predict how or when these shifts in our stories will occur, we can expect them. Paul did. When his friends warn him about his potential fate in Jerusalem, he asks, \n\n“What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”\n\n-Acts 21:13\n\nKnowing full well the danger he faced, Paul continued the ministry he was called to. He didn’t allow the unknown to paralyze him. He had been transformed on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:1-25), filled with the Spirit, and now he lived as though his life were not his own.\n\nAs a Christ follower, I want to do just that: follow Christ. I want to live life with open hands, being prepared and ready for what God has in store, rather than resistant to it. Under God’s care, we may not always know what’s coming next, but we can trust Him, come what may.\n\nSome of the stories in our lives will have sad endings we’d like to change. But the Story of our lives? We know how it ends. We’ve been promised the best ending imaginable. Our good and faithful God will prevail, and we will get spend eternity with Him. \n\nIn the meantime, let’s trust God with the other stories, the changes of course—no matter how trying, no matter how unexpected. Knowing that He is God and He is good, let us say with confidence, “The Lord’s will be done!” (Acts 21:14).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Wilbert\n\nText:  Acts 21:37-40, Acts 22:1-30, Acts 23:1-11, 1 Peter 3:21-22, Hebrews 10:19-22\n\nIn the last few verses of Acts 21, we find Paul has been arrested yet again and taken by Roman soldiers to the barracks. There he makes his defense, culminating in the reality that he is a Roman citizen and, as such, cannot be treated like he is being treated (Acts 22:23-29). When the Romans realize they have made a serious political mistake, they hand him over to the Jews, where Paul pulls the same defense—that he is one of them, a Pharisee and a son of Pharisees (Acts 23:6). That’s some impressive genealogical gymnastics, and it’s a lesson for us all. \n\nWho are we? \n\nMy pastor once said that every time the Enemy comes to remind him of his sin, he reminds the Enemy he’s right. \n\nHe is a liar.\n\nHe is guilty of the lust of the flesh.\n\nHe is like a murderer in his heart.\n\nHe is a thief, a scoundrel, and an unworthy son of God.\n\nBut no matter what we are or what we’ve done, the truest thing about us is who we are in Jesus. As my pastor so faithfully reminds me, Christ has taken our sin and borne it on our behalf. So though we are guilty of countless things, we are not identified by them. \n\nThe Enemy is a liar, but his best tactic is to take the truth and twist it just enough—leave out enough of the whole truth—that I am caught in his lair. I forget who I am, or I exaggerate who I am, or I minimize it. And, what’s more, I forget who God is. \n\nIn this passage, Paul is caught in the lair of two enemies—the Romans and the Jews—and his best defense is to say the whole truth to both. \n\nTo the Romans, he is a Roman citizen by birthright. He is endowed with all the rights and perks of his citizenship. And to the Jews, he is a Pharisee of Pharisees. He is a prince of Pharisees, student of the Torah, and righteous rabbi. Paul is not swinging from two extremes in this passage; he is telling the truth—the whole truth. \n\nSo often we get caught in the web of lies about who we are and who God is. In those moments, it’s easy to forget the cross, the blood of Christ, the resurrection, and the hope of eternity. It’s easy to forget who we are by our birth in Christ. \n\nIn those moments, remember Paul. Say to the Enemy who comes to kill, steal, and destroy (John 10:10), “I know who I am and who God is. I know my sin and my wrongdoing. And I know that all the righteousness of God has covered over me.” \n\nWe, like Paul, are on trial with “respect to the hope and resurrection of the dead” (Acts 23:6). And, friend, we will one day rise again with all the people of our eternal home country. Until then, this is the gospel antidote to the lies of our enemy: “Yes, but…” \n\n…we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ the Righteous One.\n\nHe Himself is the propitiation for our sins…\n\n– 1 John 2:1-2\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText:  Acts 23:12-35, 2 Corinthians 4:8-12, Job 33:4\n\nPaul was on the road to his death, a journey to Rome he suspected would end in martyrdom. Yet, in spite of the uncertainty ahead, he was exuberantly alive in Christ. This paradox of death and life exists for us all. Trusting in God’s good providence is life, but trusting in our own strength means only death.\n\nThough faced with a fierce opposition that constantly threatened his life, Paul did not set his hope on his own strength, nor place his trust in earthly and human things. His sight was always set upon Christ and His kingdom. The Jews, however, were a remarkable contrast. They, too, were committed to a kingdom in this life-and-death struggle, but it was not the Kingdom of Christ. \n\nForty of these men swore an oath not to eat until they killed Paul (Acts 23:12). Translators render this phrase both as “oath” and “curse,” and it comes from the Greek word anathema. I’ve heard this word used in English for strong dislike (i.e., “After she stole my boyfriend at the party, she is anathema to me.”), but that’s such a sad watering-down of this big, meaty word. Anathema is a declaration, a curse, or vow that a thing is devoted to destroying (Numbers 21:2-3, Joshua 6:17). It is a thing accursed—something set aside because of moral worthlessness.\n\nIn fact, another place this word is used in the Bible is Peter’s third betrayal of Christ. Peter was using his strongest language to emphasize the distance between himself and Christ:\n\nThen he started to curse and to swear with an oath, “I don’t know this man you’re talking about!”\n\n-Mark 14:71\n\nIn His mighty grace, Christ forgave Peter. His forgiveness is so deep. But to plot evil is to seek death instead of life. The prophet Micah reminds us that to lie in bed at night and devise evil schemes is bad, but to wake up the next morning and vow to commit yourself to them is to make a covenant with evil (Micah 2:1). It’s like the difference between crimes committed in the heat of passion and a cold-blooded resolve to do evil. \n\nIn cold blood, these men took a vow devoting themselves to the destruction of Paul, believing it was for the good of society. This combination of spiritual blindness and self-reliance is deadly. They believed that if they didn’t act, justice would never be done. But trying to take justice into our own hands shows contempt for God’s providence. The plans of those forty Jews were foiled because they’d bound themselves to do evil, which is death itself.\n\nHow often do we believe that God depends on us to wrangle our version of justice in the world? Instead, we must depend on Him and His sovereignty. Let us bind ourselves to Christ and His Kingdom, not to death and anathema or by taking things into our own hands. God is sovereign, and His is the way of life.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Acts 24:1-27, Jeremiah 29:10-14, Hebrews 13:15\n\nOn my daughter’s dresser sits a white ceramic sheep that sat on my own dresser when I was about her age. The sheep is small—a couple inches tall—and sits on its bottom, straight-legged, like a person sitting on a floor. Its front legs are pointed up, two little sheep-feet wrapped over the top of a stack of small 1×3-inch cards, each displaying a Bible verse.\n\nI always loved that sheep. Even now, when I go in my daughter’s room, I can’t resist the nostalgic urge to slide the stack out of its arms and put a new verse on top, then slide it carefully back into place.\n\nThere is something strangely compelling about encountering a Bible verse in this happenstance sort of way—a momentary feeling of mystery that ignites when I come across a verse unexpectedly. I stare at it like a puzzle piece, wondering where and how its truth fits into my current circumstances. “What does it MEAN?” I wonder.\n\nPut me in a situation like Paul was in—standing trial before yet another ruler, facing yet another set of false accusations—and I’m sure to read into every detail. Conflict isn’t exactly my specialty, so I’d probably internalize it all, anxiously assessing how each and every factor affects my main character: me. Leaving the matter unresolved is my worst-case scenario. Uncertainty is my kryptonite.\n\nThis back-and-forth with Felix went on for two years (Acts 24:27). TWO YEARS. While I’m pretty sure the uncertainty alone would be enough to kill me, I don’t get the vibe that it kept Paul up at night. I’m not sure he even regarded uncertainty as uncertainty. In his monologue before Felix, Paul said, “I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets” (Acts 24:14). It follows, then, that Paul knew and believed this little gem:\n\n“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.”\n\n– Jeremiah 29:11\n\nHere’s the difference between Paul and me (as if there’s only one): I believe God has good plans for me, but I assume His plans fall within the boundary lines of my own. In other words, God’s good plans for me are His expert version of my first draft. Paul knew better.\n\nThat little verse, presented all alone on the sheep’s card, is true because God’s Word is true. But in the context of Jeremiah 29, it is even better. That verse and those around it are God’s message sent to His people in exile through the prophet Jeremiah. We don’t have to zoom out very far to see that this message of hope from God to His people was not the quick, tidy bow we often make it out to be:\n\n“For thus says the Lord: When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place. For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord… I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.”\n\n– Jeremiah 29:10-14\n\nSeventy years. That’s how long they’d be in exile—an exile that, according to verse 14, God sent them into. Were these the plans they were hoping for? Not likely. Were they a ridiculously good promise from their ever-faithful God? Absolutely. Their exile was not the end. \n\nPaul knew this, too. He knew Scripture is true—not in part, but in whole. He knew the gospel of Jesus is true—not in part, but in whole. Paul knew God is sovereign and good—not sometimes, but all the time. Not within the boundaries we give Him, but through all of history and time and space. Our hope does not die when our hands are chained or when life seems at a standstill. Our God is sure and faithful. \n\nPaul did not know how all the pieces would fit together, but he knew his exile was not the end. Because of Jesus, neither is ours. \n\n",

There are only two front-facing windows downstairs, but for a few moments the sun angles in just right and, from front to back, there’s a rush of light across the house. It’s my favorite time of day. \n\nThis morning, I am sitting at our dining room table trying to sort through my workday needs (this post being at the top of the list). And in that stream of light, all I can see are the particles of dust floating, the worn edges of chairs and tables in the living room, and the small cobweb growing in the corner of the window. The light, beautiful as it is, reveals the grime. \n\nI’ve been busy, see, trying to do what I think God has called me to these days. I’m caring for the needs of my home and trying to figure out what my purpose is in this new foreign place we’ve moved to. I’ve been so preoccupied with learning to be faithful in these things, that I haven’t even noticed the cobweb in the corner of the window. But the light reveals my lack.\n\nNone of us likes to have our sin brought out into the light and revealed to ourselves, let alone to others.\n\nNo one wants to have that Paul-on-the-Road-to-Damascus moment, where the light as bright as the sun shone around him, pinning him to the ground, and delving into the darkest parts and intentions of his heart (Acts 26:13-14). But God once called the light good (Genesis 1:4), and we have to believe this is one of the reasons why. The light reveals what the night has hidden and brings to sight what has been forgotten. \n\nPsalm 37:28 says, “the Lord loves justice,” and I am a little like that. But mostly I love justice when it’s given to others. I squirm when I myself come under the light—my faults revealed and my sins displayed. I hate justice then. I feel the same about the dust particles and cobwebs as I feel about my propensity to doubt, to fear, to sin with my words and deeds. \n\nIn the light I am embarrassed, ashamed, and fearful of being found out. But God loves the light. \n\nAs we see in this passage, He wants His children to turn away from darkness and step into the light. The thing that makes us feel most naked and exposed is one of the things our God loves most—not because of the pain and discomfort we feel in the midst of it, but because it reveals our greatest need: God Himself. \n\nWhat is the light exposing in your life today? What dust particles and cobwebs have been lurking in the living room of your heart? What besetting doubts and fears have taken up residence in your soul? \n\nGod is preparing for you a Damascus Road experience, whether here or in eternity, in which every one of your thoughts and sins will be exposed. But He is also like the father of the prodigal son in this and in every moment: picking up His robes and running, undignified, toward His child who has come to his senses and come home (Luke 15:11-32).\n\nDon’t run from the light today, friends. Go stand in it, be blinded by it, and see the manifold magnificent grace of the Father who shines it on you. \n\n \n\n",

In fact, I don’t think they even knew each other existed or had anything in common, except for the fact that they were characters played in the same production of 42nd Street by the same actress—me. \n\nThey were polar opposites. Gladys was a seasoned Broadway showgirl, singing her heart out while teaching the lead how to tap dance. Ragamuffin #3 was an unnamed beggar, wearied by the Great Depression. I’d love to know what was running through the director’s mind as she cast the roles. When she spread out all of the submitted headshots and stared into those hopeful faces, I wonder what made her point to mine and think, Gladys! and… Ragamuffin #3.\n\nBackstage, my dressing room had two separate racks. Gladys’ was all sequins and show, while Ragamuffin #3’s was bare and battered. During the show, I’d shuffle behind the curtains to apply or remove lipstick, change and adjust wigs, and look down to make sure I wasn’t wearing tap shoes with my beggar’s clothes. Any small change could poke holes in the audience’s perception of the story, so it was up to me to make sure Gladys and Ragamuffin #3 didn’t meet during the show. \n\nIsn’t it funny how even the smallest details can create or destroy our perception? \n\nIf I take a seat in the audience of my own life, I begin to cast myself and my circumstances in the leading role. When I get a new job and move to a new city, I’m bathing in sequins for days. But when I’m tossing and turning, worrying about my relationships, I’m costumed in tattered old rags. \n\nI wonder if those aboard the ship in Acts 27 felt like they were auditioning for forgotten, unnamed roles. The ship was seemingly built to wreck, the storm to destroy, the disease to kill, the crew to die. Any audience member would assume they’d been cast and chosen for the role of suffering. And yet, our circumstances don’t write our story; God does. \n\nThe ship crashes on the island of Malta and the turning point is seemingly nowhere in sight, when Paul breaks out of character, shedding the costume of suffering, and healing those around him. Now, the curtain could fall here and tell the wrong story, encouraging us to serve from our suffering and applaud the go-getter. \n\nBut what if that’s not what God has for us here? What if Jesus wants to meet us backstage and between the curtains, past the crowd and the circumstances? I don’t think God spreads our faces across a board, separating His children into categories of “suffering” and “celebrating.” Instead, He just claims us as “His,” over and over again. We are a chorus of His beloved sons and daughters. \n\nWhen we let His truth about our identity create our perception, the focus is no longer the role of suffering or serving, but the One who combined the two on the cross. We need Ragamuffin #3 just as much as we need Gladys; but just as they are cast to tell a story, so are we. \n\nMay we renew our faith in the Director, and assume our appointed roles in the truthful pages of His gospel. Amen.\n\n \n\n",

He is wearing his hospital gown, sitting in the chair in his hospital room, and my three small children are sitting next to him, perched in a row on the window sil. Dad is grinning at them, eyes bright, and the kids are all carefree smiles and laughter, no idea the end was so near.\n\nWe visited him as often as we could back then, in the hospital and at home, stealing every moment with him we could get. And he was always glad to see us, drinking up our presence even on his hardest days. \n\nIt never occurred to me that he didn’t have to welcome us in. I never considered that the vulnerability of those final days was not just thrust upon him, but something he chose to embrace. We saw each day as an opportunity to be with him, and despite having every reason to opt out, he chose to see it as the same.\n\nThis last chapter of Acts does not tell us about Paul’s death, but we know he was eventually martyred in Rome. And we know this is how he spent his final years:\n\n“He welcomed all who visited him, proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with full boldness and without hindrance.”\n\n– Acts 28:30\n\nIf it were me, I think I would need a minute. All those years of faithfully preaching the gospel, traveling from city to city, raising up young churches and mentoring new pastors, not to mention being falsely accused and imprisoned time and time again for speaking the truth—after all that, I would view house arrest as an overdue opportunity for a long, well-deserved nap. Not Paul. Paul didn’t need a minute.\n\nPaul knew what awaited him.\n\nCould he see his martyrdom coming? Possibly. But he could definitely see beyond it. Paul wasn’t living for this vapor of a life here on earth. He was living for something bigger. Paul was living for the gospel. And here’s how he did it: he lived for the eternal by making the most of the temporary.\n\nThe apostle didn’t while away his time on earth just to get to the next chapter. He did something radical—he believed the good news was true and he lived like it.\n\n“From dawn to dusk he expounded and witnessed about the kingdom of God.”\n\n– Acts 28:23\n\nThe book of Acts reminds us that, like Paul, we are part of the biggest picture—we, the Church, are part of God’s story. This is our story, and Paul is our brother. But the call of this book is not to be like Paul. The call of this book is to be like Christ.\n\nJesus, too, looked beyond the present while embracing it. Jesus, too, poured Himself out “as a drink offering” to His final day (2 Timothy 4:6). But He did so much more. \n\nThe Christ who was the hope of the Apostle Paul is also our hope, having taken upon Himself all of our sin—past, present, and future—and suffered separation from the Father so that we might be reconciled to God (2 Corinthians 5:21). Then, having endured the punishment of death that was due us, He was resurrected, making us alive in Him (1 Corinthians 15:20, 22). And now—right now—He sits at the right hand of the Father, actively advocating on our behalf (Romans 8:34).\n\nThis Christ is our hope. \n\nYou and I are vulnerable like Paul. We, too, will have last days. But we can live those and all our days fully, joyfully pouring out every last drop, knowing that our hope in Jesus will never, ever end. Thanks be to God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 1:1-17, 2 Samuel 7:12-16, 2 Corinthians 5:17\n\nIf you could have access to only one book for the rest of your life, which would you choose? \n\nJudging from their devoted habits and bold commentary, it seems a great many theological giants in Church history would have made Romans their go-to text for a lifetime. Early church father John Chrysostom had the book read aloud to him once a week. Poet and preacher Samuel Taylor Coleridge called it “the profoundest piece of writing in existence.” The famous sixteenth-century Bible translator William Tyndale wrote of Romans, “It is the principal and most excellent part of the New Testament… No man can read it too oft.” Martin Luther, St. Augustine, and John Wesley all came to assured faith through the impact of Romans.\n\nWhat is it about this book that has captivated the attention of believers across the ages? What makes Romans so unique? \n\nAll Scripture is God-breathed and equally valuable—God’s special revelation given to us that we might know Him. But Romans is distinct in that it provides the most comprehensive expression of the gospel found in the Bible. This book reaches back deep into the Old Testament to walk us through the origin and problem of sin, the reality of guilt, and the impossibility of saving ourselves. And it presents, systematically yet succinctly, the ultimate rescue we’re given in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn short, Romans contains the essential gospel.\n\nFrom the opening statements of his letter, Paul makes clear his purpose for writing: to present and promote the gospel of Jesus Christ. He introduces himself as Christ’s servant, “set apart for the gospel of God” (Romans 1:1). He addresses the letter to “all who are in Rome, loved by God,” expressing his commitment to telling them “the good news about [God’s] Son” (vv.7-9). And he conveys how desperately he has desired to visit the city personally: “I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome” (v.15).\n\nPaul then turns from his brief introduction to make a stunningly clear pronouncement on where he stands when it comes to the message of Christ:\n\nFor I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.\n\n– Romans 1:16\n\nPaul was confident in his calling to preach the gospel because he was certain of the saving power of his God. I am a servant of Christ… I am an apostle… I am set apart for the gospel… I am eager to preach the good news… I am not ashamed. \n\nIt is with this unshakeable confidence that Paul, the self-proclaimed “worst of sinners” (1 Timothy 1:15), wrote to the believers at Rome—to explain to Jewish and Gentile converts alike what it means to believe in and be redeemed by Jesus Christ. For this is no metaphorical salvation; it is the real-life rescue of broken and complicated people by the all-powerful hand of a merciful God.\n\nLean in close as Paul presents his longest letter in Scripture, a sermon on what it means to be a Christ follower in this life. Listen as he tells of God’s holiness, justice, and compassion. Read this book as though it is telling a single story—the story of how God rescues us through the sacrifice of Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Righteousness and Wrath of God",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 1:18-32, Proverbs 1:7, 2 Timothy 3:1-9\n\nIn all of Paul’s letters, there are few bleaker passages than the one we encounter in Romans 1:18-32. Here Paul paints a picture of total depravity, gleeful rebellion, and blind rejection of God—all of which incur the deserved wrath of God. It’s dark and it’s grim, but there is one thing you especially need to know about it:\n\nIt’s your story.\n\nIf you’re like me, that might sound strange. Like many lifelong Christians, I was raised in the church, a rule-following “good girl” who never colored outside the lines. My life looks nothing like Paul’s portrait of self-destruction. And yet, his language is intentionally vague. He never specifies who this passage is about. Scholars have speculated—perhaps it’s about Adam and Eve, or perhaps he is describing non-Christians. But most scholars, like Dr. Douglas Moo, a professor at Wheaton College, interpret his words more broadly: “[Paul] has in view human beings generally, prone to turn away from God because of the original fall into sin.” \n\nIn other words, this passage is about us. \n\nPaul speaks of the “godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth”—the people who struggle with “envy, murder, quarrels, deceit, and malice” (vv.18, 29). And those people he’s describing? Well, they’re us—all of us. Paul isn’t singling out a particular group of people; he’s diagnosing the human condition. \n\nLeft to our own devices, sin distorts our souls like water-warped wood. For every human ever born, that is our story. At least, it would have been our story had God not intervened.\n\nWhat we see in Romans 1:18-32 is a vision of our fate, had God not planned our rescue. Without God’s grace we were all “by nature deserving of wrath” (Ephesians 2:3). To understand exactly what these harsh words mean, we must be careful not to confuse God’s “wrath” with human forms of anger. Theologian John Stott describes human anger as “irrational and uncontrollable emotion, containing much vanity, animosity, malice, and the desire for revenge.” God’s wrath, on the other hand, “is absolutely free of all such poisonous ingredients.” \n\nBy comparison, God’s wrath is His “holy hostility to evil.” This hostility is not arbitrary. God does not pick rules out of a hat, and smite those who fail to conform. No, God directs His hostility squarely at the destructive effects of sin. Sin steals, kills, and destroys everything it touches, including the crown jewel of His creation: humankind. It degrades and dismantles us, and God’s response to this cosmic terrorism is total opposition. God opposes sin because He is good and righteous and just. \n\nHe also opposes it because of His love. Like a father’s white-knuckle rage at his son’s addiction, or a mother’s howling grief at her daughter’s eating disorder, God’s wrath is an expression of His love. It is hostility towards that which devours His children whole.\n\nThis side of eternity, we may never understand the mysterious balance between God’s active condemnation and the natural consequences of human sin. But together, these two elements constitute God’s righteous wrath against all human sin. That is our story—every one of us. Apart from the grace of God, we would only choose death. \n\nWhenever we read these words, we must ask the Spirit to reveal ourselves within them, because we cannot have the good news without the bad news. We cannot call it “salvation” if we are not being saved from something—namely, ourselves. Self-ruin is the only place our sin will ever take us. But, thanks to Jesus, it doesn’t have to.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Vivian Mabuni\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 2:1-16, Deuteronomy 16:18-20, Titus 1:15\n\nHead shaking, brow furrowed, she looked perplexed. Confusion filled her dark brown eyes. “I don’t understand,” she said.\n\nI explained further. “The Chinese and Japanese character used to translate ‘sin’ is the word zui, which means ‘crime.’”\n\nShe nodded and motioned for me to continue.\n\n“I think that translation can be somewhat limiting. I imagine you haven’t really spent time in jail or committed a crime like robbing a bank. I imagine you consider yourself a pretty good person.”\n\nShe nodded again. \n\n“I used to think of myself as a pretty good person, too” I said. “But then someone asked, if a movie were made of my life, if there were certain scenes I’d want deleted. I knew exactly which scenes I didn’t want anyone to see. And these scenes were not just of the times I did things I knew I shouldn’t, but also when I didn’t do things I knew I should. Our sin problem shows itself in both ways—in the things we do and the things we don’t do. We all sin. No one lives a life free of scenes they wouldn’t want others to see.”\n\nPaul goes to great lengths in the first three chapters of Romans to help us understand the totality and consequences of our sin. He lists the manifestations of sin at the end of chapter one, then goes on to explain how his readers not only judge others, but also practice the very things for which they pass judgment. \n\nAnd it’s true: most of us consider ourselves “good” people, qualified to judge others for their many shortcomings—that is, until we place our own sin-plagued lives next to Christ’s righteousness. Jesus is the only one who lived a perfect, God-honoring, shame-free life. \n\nBoth Jews and Gentiles—and both you and I—fall short under God’s holy judgment. We are all guilty, often of the very same things for which we condemn others. But there is good news: \n\nFor God loved the world in this way. He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.\n\n– John 3:16\n\nWe are born spiritually dead, our sin separating us from a life with God. But God, in the person of Jesus Christ, has made a way for us to know Him, both in this earthly life and for all eternity (John 17:3). \n\nJust as God Himself provides the way for us to be reconciled to Him, He also does the work of revealing to us our sin—of showing us how our “goodness” falls short of His righteousness. The Holy Spirit does the convicting (John 16:8), which frees us to love and to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15).\n\nIn Romans, Paul writes systematically to knock away our sense of ever being righteous in and of ourselves. God’s invitation is not to mere ethics or manufactured goodness, but to the utter, complete transformation that takes place when we are made new in Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nMay God melt away our pride that keeps us from total dependence on Him. By His grace, may we love others, even as they fall short like we also do. And may we recognize and receive God’s kindness that leads us to repentance. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 2:17-29, Deuteronomy 7:25-26, Psalm 51:1-12\n\nIn one of my seminary classes, we were to read Athanasius’ On the Incarnation, as well as— according to the syllabus—the book’s preface written by C.S. Lewis. Paying close attention to the syllabus (thought not that close), I read both the preface and the introduction.\n\nA few weeks later, during his lecture, the professor pointed out that we technically didn’t have to read the book’s introduction, but he said if we’d been smart, we would have. He explained this had been his intention—even if the syllabus hadn’t spelled it out explicitly.\n\nWas he assuming we were mind readers? Not really. He just had expectations. \n\nAt some point, we all give instructions—to colleagues, to children, to friends, to husbands—that may not be perfect or exact, but we hope the recipient will pick up on our intent, on the spirit of what we’re asking them to do. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t. \n\nPaul is giving a similar instruction here to the Jewish Christians in Rome. He is echoing Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, asking Jesus’ followers to read deeper into the Law. Paul tells them it’s not about following the letter of the law. It’s about following the heart of the One who wrote it. \n\nPaul’s laundry list of law-breaking activities in verses 21-23, reads similarly to what Jesus said in Matthew 5:\n\nYou have heard that it was said to those of old, “You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.” But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment.\n\n– Matthew 5:21-22\n\nJesus preached these words to some who knew the Law backwards and forwards, but He was holding up a magnifying glass to their hearts. They weren’t out murdering people—they were law-following Jews, after all—but what was going on in their hearts? Were they angry with their brother? Jesus said then they, too, are deserving of punishment. The spirit of the Law was broken, even if the exact rule was not. \n\nPaul does the same for his readers. He questions their obedience to the Law, but then he reminds them it’s the posture of their hearts that matters most. These proud Jewish Christians came from a long heritage of trying to earn righteousness by following the Law. They too easily forgot that Jesus came to fulfill the Law for them, to make them righteous by simply believing in Him. \n\nIt’s not hard to see myself in the Jewish Christians of Rome, slipping back into trying to follow the rules rather than the One who wrote them. It’s easy to think my righteousness comes from  acting the right way, rather than from “the Way” Himself (John 14:6). But as the psalmist tells us, “would God not discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart” (Psalm 44:21).\n\nIf I’m honest, what’s going on inside my heart is usually much uglier than how I act on the outside. Thankfully, Jesus came to wash me clean from the inside out. This is the beauty of the cross and the gift of the Holy Spirit: to compel me to seek God’s heart first, and obey His law by the help of His Spirit.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Carrie Gaul\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 3:1-20, Psalm 14:1-7, Ecclesiastes 7:20\n\n“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”\n\nIf you read Paul’s letters enough, you’re bound to catch this recurring theme.\n\nWhy did he find it so important for believers in the first century (and us!) to understand they were sinners?\n\nBecause God loves sinners.\n\n“But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us!” (Rm 5:8).\n\nJesus came to earth for sinners. He lived, died, and rose again for sinners. He forgives sinners. And sinners who place their faith in Him are welcomed into His family.\n\nThat’s really good news for sinners, right? And Scripture leaves no doubt. You, me, and every person on earth… we’re all sinners. That’s the bottom line Paul lays out in Romans 3:23.\n\nWe’re all broken, needy, and messed-up in a way that simply being “good” can never fix.  \n\nSince the Garden of Eden, our identity as humans has been marked by our tendency to rebel against God. That’s why we can never behave our way into a right relationship with Him. The most well-behaved, law-abiding, church-attending, choir-singing, modest-dressing, moralistic person alive, apart from Jesus Christ, is still dead in her trespasses and sins (Eph 2:1).\n\nThe heartbeat of the gospel is not, “Clean up your act, obey the rules, and God will forgive you.” That’s moralism, not Christianity. Any one of us who has ever tried to be a perfect person, even for a day, knows that approach simply doesn’t work. That false gospel stands in direct contradiction to the true one: Christ died for sinners. Because He loves us, remember?\n\nDo we encourage each other—and ourselves—to obedience? Absolutely! But let’s also remember that righteousness does not come through our obedience. Right standing with God comes only through faith in Jesus—His works and not our own. As Paul says in verse 24, “They are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”\n\nThrough Jesus, grace flows freely to sinners. Through Jesus, those guilty and condemned are declared righteous—justified by His sacrifice, by grace through faith. And through Jesus, polluted sinners exchange filthy rags for robes of righteousness.\n\n“I greatly rejoice in the Lord,\nI exult in my God;\nfor has clothed me with the garments of salvation\nand wrapped me in a robe of righteousness… ” (Isaiah 61:10).\n\nEditor’s Note: In Romans, Paul is building a case for the good news that is ours in Christ by faith. He uses these early chapters to establish our guilt before God—which he does to establish our need for a Savior. One of the most challenging aspects of the gospel is that it is based on the death and resurrection of Christ, necessitated by our own sin. We cannot understand the depth of God’s love for us in Christ without understanding the depth of our need for that sacrifice and the sin it covers. Because of Jesus, our sin is not counted against us, so we are never just “sinners.” We are redeemed sinners. A new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). What an amazing gift it is to know that “God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 3:21-31, Ephesians 1:7-10, Colossians 1:13-14\n\nI love a good “before and after.”\n\nWhether it’s watching the last ten minutes of an episode of HGTV’s Fixer Upper or following a designer’s Instagram feed, I just can’t get enough of those visual transformations. Give me all the before-and-after shots of your kitchen, bathroom, closet—even your hair!—magically morphed from cluttered to clean. I never, ever tire of them.\n\nReading Romans 3:21-31 reminds me of my makeover obsession. These verses are all about our “after”—who we are because of God’s grace “by the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (v.24). The power of this passage lies in its contrast to the one before it. What would an “after” photo be if we never saw the “before”?\n\nA beautiful kitchen is a beautiful kitchen. But when we see that kitchen as it once was—dated tile, linoleum floors, and missing cabinet doors—compared to its transformed state of marble countertops and hardwood floors, we appreciate its newness and beauty that much more.\n\nSo let’s back up to Romans 3:20, our “before” shot that says, “For no one will be justified in his sight by the works of the law, because the knowledge of sin comes through the law.” That’s bad news for us. It means all the good stuff we did last week, all the good deeds and hard work—it’s all meaningless in itself.\n\nBut…\n\nBut now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the Law and the Prophets. The righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.\n\n– Romans 3:21-22\n\nThis, friends, is the good news! No, we are not justified by the law, but we are justified in Christ.\n\nGod presented him as an atoning sacrifice in his blood, received through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be righteous and declare righteous the one who has faith in Jesus.\n\n– Romans 3:25-26\n\nNow, imagine knowing this good news with no understanding of the bad news that preceded it. Imagine seeing the “after” without seeing the “before.” It wouldn’t really be good news then, would it? In light of the bad news, the promise found in verses 25-26 is that much brighter, more hopeful. The contrast is everything.\n\nOur before is not a pretty picture. It is devoid of God and, therefore, full of despair. As Paul quoted the Hebrew scriptures, “all have turned away…ruin and wretchedness are in their paths” (Romans 3:12,16).\n\nBut…\n\nThis passage today is our after. The ones who have faith in Jesus are righteous. Not the ones who do the most, achieve the most, or follow the letter of the law the best. Unlike those HGTV makeovers, it’s not the amount of work we put in that brings us from before to after; it’s Christ’s work on the cross that transforms us. He, and He alone, declares us righteous before the one true God.\n\nPerhaps this is why I love seeing visual transformations so much. They help me to remember the gospel’s redemption in my own life. It’s a reminder I desperately need to hear, over and over again. It was not our blood, sweat, and tears that brought us back into relationship with God. It was His.\n\nWe are forever grateful, Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 4:1-25, Psalm 32:1-2, Ephesians 2:4-7\n\nLet me tell you what everybody’s talking about these days: kale. I know, first telegrams were all the rage, later to be followed by fast food drive-thrus, “The Electric Slide,” and space travel. But now we’ve finally peaked with an affection for curly leaves that sprout from the ground.\n\nAt first, I really thought I was missing out. Kale seemed to be every celebrity’s best kept secret, every magazine’s healthy choice, and every grocery cart’s consistent companion. So, I tossed a bunch of kale into my produce bag and raced to the checkout line, anxious to taste this treat of the century. In the car, I tore the stem off like a cupcake wrapper, stuffing a handful of leaves into my mouth. I wanted to like it more than anything, but friends, gag reflexes don’t lie.\n\nIn contrast to the controversial kale, it would be difficult to find someone who didn’t like Abraham. His popularity was well-deserved, his reputation flawless, his character impeccable. The Jews looked up to him as a forefather paving the trail of faith, a man whose righteousness, they hoped, would inspire their own. If they were anything like me, they’d stuff themselves silly with anything that promised a chance at gaining his status.\n\nPerhaps some Jews tried to duplicate Abraham’s righteousness with their own try-hard attempts at earning favor with God. But no matter their determination, the results would remain bitter and unsavory. Exhausted, they might look to him and wonder, How does he do it?\n\nI asked the same of my friend Amanda, who eats a salad for lunch every single day and, consequently, is very well versed in the area of all-things-kale. She laughed, explaining that no one eats kale plain. Apparently (you probably already knew this), you drench it in dressing, blend it in a smoothie, or soften it with olive oil. By itself, kale isn’t the star ingredient, but when covered in other flavors, it gets all the credit for being delicious. Abraham’s secret had a similar flavor: “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness” (Romans 4:3).\n\nAt first glance, it’s easy to assume that if anyone could achieve righteousness, it would probably be a guy like Abraham. But like you and me, he had sin pumping through his veins. And so Abraham is not the achiever in this passage—God is. Abraham simply believed God and His promises.\n\nNow to the one who works, pay is not considered as a gift, but as something owed. But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who declares the ungodly to be righteous, his faith is credited for righteousness.\n\n– Romans 4:4-5\n\nHear this good news, friends. Because Christ was righteousness in our place, we, too, are drenched in His goodness, credited with His coveted status—we’re the very fragrance of Christ before our Father (2 Corinthians 2:14). May we always believe with the faith of Abraham, receiving God’s promises with open hands and thankful hearts. Amen.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Hope That Will Not Disappoint",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 5:1-11, Galatians 4:6-7, Ephesians 2:18-22\n\nSeven years ago I found myself so emotionally, physically, and spiritually debilitated that just getting out of bed in the morning was difficult. I’d never struggled with acute depression before, but after soldiering through the deaths of several of my loved ones and a cancer scare of my own, my get-up-and-go was totally gone. All I wanted was to wave a white flag at life and crawl under the covers, venturing out just long enough to grab another pint of ice cream.\n\nIf someone had given me some perky acrostic or suggested I listen to a sermon entitled, “Ten Things Victorious Christians Do to Kick Disappointment and Despair to the Curb,” I’d have kicked them in the shins. Fortunately, Lynn, the Christian counselor I’ve gone to for years, doesn’t prescribe the dangerous meds of “minimizing grief” or “multiplying guilt.” Instead, she was silent as I sobbed, empathetic as I lamented.\n\nLynn gave me this advice: “Cling to Jesus and do the next right thing.” \n\nShe told me to stop trying to tackle the troubles of an entire day, much less a week, month, or year. I was simply to move forward one step at a time. Some days I’d wake to the alarm clock only to be hit with a shock of emotion as I remembered my circumstances. And other days, just whispering the name of our Savior gave me enough grit to pull back the covers and get out of bed.\n\nDay by day, inch by laborious inch, Jesus led me by the hand through that dark valley of life— one step at a time. \n\nI know far too many people who have lost their joy and all but lost their faith in Jesus because endurance was an overlooked muscle group in their Christian vocabulary. And so they’d stop attending Bible study, then church, fading away from their faith community in the midst of their malaise. Some have been wounded by that very same community of believers. Others have simply lost the energy and will to put on a happy face, to pretend their get-up-and-go hasn’t left them too.\n\nSurely our Creator-Redeemer weeps over the gaping holes in the fabric of His covenant family. We weren’t created to be wincing, jaded isolationists. We were created in God’s image, in the image of the triune God who exists in perfect relational harmony with Himself as Father, Son, and Spirit (Genesis 1:26). We’re hardwired for relationship, for communing with others of the faith.\n\nWhen life leaves us disappointed, disillusioned, and despairing, we need to resist the urge to withdraw from the body of Christ. Instead, we need to move toward other passionate—albeit flawed—Christ-followers to walk with us toward healing. We need to be honest with them, with God, and with ourselves about the true state of our hearts. We need them circling around us, crying out, “Abba Father!” on our behalf, reminding us of the Truth: we are no longer slaves, but daughters of the one true God (Galatians 4:6-7).\n\nTogether, we can persevere toward the living hope of the Lord Jesus Christ to whom we’ve been called. \n\nOnly God can love us unconditionally. Hoping in Him will never disappoint us the way the world does time and time again. Because “God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit” we can learn to rejoice and hope again, even in our pain (Romans 5:3,5). But it’s only in clinging to Him that we will find the strength to move forward in faith, one step at a time.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melissa Zaldivar\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 5:12-21, Genesis 3:17-19, 1 Corinthians 15:21-22\n\nSometimes, the weight of living this life just gets to us. It feels sticky and scratchy, less graceful and more gritty. We wander into and out of seasons that leave us asking where God is in the middle of grief or loss or emptiness. \n\nA few weeks ago, I lost my grandfather slowly and suddenly. He was tired one day and hospitalized the next. Not three weeks later, he was gone.\n\nIn those days between admitting him to the hospital and him meeting Jesus, I couldn’t seem to rectify the fact that what was happening felt so foreign and yet so expected. Death is a terrible reality that we live with, an awful and haunting sort of event that wrecks us. But, as we learn early on, it’s inevitable: death is a part of life.\n\nOne night, as I was adjusting his oxygen mask, my fingers combed through his hair, damp with sweat because his breathing was so labored. It reminded me of my nieces waking from a nap, their fine hair damp and sticking to their foreheads. And then I thought of my grandfather as a young boy, running around, playing and sweaty. His mother must have pushed his hair off his forehead, just as I was doing now.\n\nLater, after he was gone, a friend would remark to me, “You know, we labor into this world and we really labor out of it, too.”\n\nOne evening around dusk, I pulled him up to a sitting position, and together we shuffled over to a chair by the window. I sat in front of him, asking question after question about his life. The vesper light caught his eyes as he told me about a career of flying planes all around the world for the Navy. We both knew things were drawing to a close. Still, in that moment, I sensed a very real peace. We both did. It was as if we both understood that our bodies may break down, but Christ has given us life that will carry on for the rest of eternity.\n\nPart of me couldn’t believe his earthly life was coming to an end. But another part of me knew better: this is what happens. Sometimes, we live so deeply rooted in our fallen, fragile reality that we forget there is another, better, truer one.\n\nFor if by the one man’s trespass the many died, how much more have the grace of God and the gift which comes through the grace of the one man Jesus Christ overflowed to the many.\n\n– Romans 5:15\n\nWhen I’m in the throes of hospital visits and errands and trying to make the best of every moment, I can forget the truth. Because of Jesus, life is more than survival or death. It is eternal (Romans 5:20-21).\n\nThese days since my grandfather’s death, I’ve been thinking about how, as a Christian, I live a life marked by beautiful disagreement. Even when it seems death is the only option, the life and light of Christ finds a way to break through. Even when 21 shots are fired and a flag is folded graveside, there is still hope. Even as we watched the setting sun one last time together, we saw the beauty in the darkness.\n\nEven in death, grace reigns.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Our New Life in Christ",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebekah Lyons\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 6:1-14, 2 Corinthians 5:18-21, Colossians 3:1-11\n\nMy daughter was baptized a few months ago.\n\nShe decided to follow Jesus in her elementary years, and considered baptism a long while until she entered middle school. The week prior, a pastor from our church sat down in our kitchen to talk to her about the weight of this decision. She was choosing to publicly testify Christ as her Lord to anyone who asked. This was a commitment to follow and serve Jesus no matter what, even when it was difficult.\n\nThe following Sunday she wrote a letter to Jesus, just between them, and pinned it to a wooden cross at the front of our sanctuary before taking her turn in the waters. As her daddy lowered her beneath the water he offered the words, “buried with Jesus in the likeness of His death, and raised to walk in newness of life” (Romans 6:4).\n\nScripture says we joined Jesus in His death when we were baptized. Death no longer rules over Christ Jesus, nor does it rule over those who believe in Him. What’s more, when we died with Christ, we were set free from the power of sin. “For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time.” As believers in Christ Jesus, we are to “consider [ourselves] dead to sin and alive to God” (vv. 9-11).\n\nBut if we’ve truly died to sin, why do we continue to live in it? The act of sharing in Christ’s death wouldn’t be a one-time thing any more than taking communion would be a one-time thing. In fact, we’re told to examine our hearts before we take the bread and the cup (1 Corinthians 11:27). We ought to examine our hearts in everything and invite God to search our hearts too (Psalm 139:23).\n\nWhen we take a lackadaisical approach to our sin, we give it room to rule over us, to distract us. As those who have been crucified with Christ, sin is no longer our ruler. We are not under the law but under grace (Galatians 2:20; Romans 6:14).\n\nThis begs the question: What in my life needs to die each day? What has become an idol, a security, a focus, or a prop that has pushed God aside? I never seem to see sin enter my heart until I hear it roll off my tongue—a little sarcasm here, a critique there. Then envy soon follows, before resentment settles in and camps out. \n\nFor starters, my pride needs to die. It needs to die a thousand deaths. It’s the temptation of the religious leader to get puffed up by our words, thinking the message is ours. But the truth is that God has planted His Word in our hearts (Hebrews 10:16). We are simply called to speak His Word when summoned.\n\nThere’s something else that needs to die for me in this season: production. It’s time for me to get quiet after a long season of pouring out. Making room for the death of an idol opens wide the gates for a new beginning, a new imagination for what God will bring about in the days ahead. I’m walking out these days with an expectant heart, putting my ear to the ground, and listening for a fresh refrain of reverence.\n\nI wonder, is there something that needs to die for you today? When you are joined in Christ’s death through faith, you are also raised with Him in newness of life. Laying down your idols will open the floodgates for freedom to reign once more, making room for new life to spring forth again.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "From Slaves of Sin to Slaves of God",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 6:15-23, Galatians 5:13-14, 1 Peter 2:11-17\n\nWhen I was in elementary school, I decided I was going to grow an apple tree in our backyard. I didn’t tell my family about it. I wanted to do it secretly so that one day when there was a blossoming apple tree growing out of my mother’s flower bed, everyone would be amazed and I could reveal that I had grown it.\n\nI hoarded an apple seed from an apple I had eaten earlier in the day and smuggled it into the backyard when no one was looking. I dug a shallow hole in the flowerbed, placed the seed inside, and covered it with dirt. Then I hoped for the best.\n\nIn our last Romans passage we learned that Jesus’ death and resurrection does not mean life is a free-for-all, or that we can live however we like because of God’s grace. It means our motivation has changed. We don’t live under the yoke of the law any longer; we live under the covering of Christ, and that gift of grace motivates us to live by God’s Word.  \n\nIn Romans 6:15-23, Paul gives us another reason why Christians should not continue to sin simply because grace is now at play: fruit.\n\nBefore you knew Christ, Paul says, you were slaves of sin (Romans 6:17). And “…when you were slaves of sin, you were free from allegiance to righteousness. So what fruit was produced then from the things you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death. But now, since you have been liberated from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification—and the end is eternal life!” (Romans 6:22).\n\nWhen we interpret the message of grace as permission to continue sinning, we miss out on living a life that bears fruit, and instead, we live lives marked by death, for that is what sin is. This is not only harmful to our own souls; it is harmful to our witness. First Peter 2:12 says, “Conduct yourselves honorably among the Gentiles, so that when they slander you as evildoers, they will observe your good works and will glorify God on the day he visits.”\n\nOur lives do not bear fruit in order for us to look good to others. Our lives bear fruit so that others will see it and know its Source. A fruitless life does not point to our Creator. A fruit-filled one glorifies Him with each step we take (John 15:8).  \n\nYou can probably guess what happened with my apple seed in the backyard. Absolutely nothing. While I had the big idea right—apple seed leads to apple tree—I went about it all wrong. If you really want to grow an apple tree in your backyard, it’s much more complicated than burying a seed and hoping for the best. I looked it up. The real process involves things like “germinating” and “grafting” and transferring the plant from various-sized pots until it is ready for the ground. Then maybe, hopefully, your tree will grow and bear fruit.\n\nI eventually forgot all about my apple tree. Days, weeks, and months went by, and since nothing was growing, I forgot about the seed and my little secret plan. It had been a fruitless effort because I had not properly cared for its growth.\n\nOh, that my Christian life would be the opposite of that poor, non-existent apple tree, that I would live motivated by grace so that others would see a life in full bloom, and that its beauty would point them to its source.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "How Can Death Bring Life?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Annie Downs\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 7:1-13, Proverbs 1:19, John 14:6-7\n\nMy buddy Andrea wrote yesterday’s post, and I loved it. But no offense to her, sometimes real, live fruit can show up without much planning. Here’s what I mean.\n\nI follow one of my favorite Instagram accounts specifically for the Insta-stories. One account I adore is of an incredibly fun mom living in Florida. Last week, she did three or four videos of the same tree: an avocado tree. Hanging from the branches were dozens of avocados.\n\n“Look at these beauties!” she yelled to the camera, “And my husband takes all the credit for this tree!”\n\nApparently, a few years before, he’d planted the pit of an avocado there in the backyard, just behind the pool, and voila! AVOCADOS! He didn’t plan it or even care for it. Just planted the pit once the original avocado was eaten and then didn’t think about it again.\n\nJust a dead pit. Buried in the ground.\n\nWhat viewers like me saw was the tree—the product, the fruit grown from the death. But the part we didn’t see were all those days in the middle. The dead days. The days where nothing grew and nothing changed on the outside, but everything was changing on the inside.\n\nI need to see the avocados. And I need to see the dead days too. Because I feel them. Don’t you? There are stories in my life that just plain feel dead. It feels like I did all the work I knew to do, and yet nothing seems to be growing or changing.\n\nBut death brings life. So it is with us because of Jesus.\n\nTherefore, my brothers and sisters, you also were put to death in relation to the law through the body of Christ so that you may belong to another… (Romans 7:4).\n\nTo be a Christian means that we belong to Jesus. And He belongs to us. Our sin was there on the cross. Our flesh was crucified with Him. And when He went to the grave to conquer death, He took our sin—our past, present, and still-to-come-future sin—with Him and buried it all there.\n\nAfter those three dead days had passed, Jesus came back, fully alive, and brought us, His made-new creation, with Him (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nI’m not a huge avocado fan, but I can see an object lesson when it’s before me. So I went to the grocery store, found two avocadoes that felt ripe-ish, and bought them. I didn’t have a plan—I just knew I needed them.\n\nI got home, sliced one open, and no kidding, the minute I saw the pit I started crying. Because I saw it, right there in the middle, the death that had grown life and sustenance. I pulled it out with a knife, washed it off in the sink, and just held it. And prayed.\n\nI asked God about all the avocado pits I see in my life, things that look dead. And I asked if they were ever going to grow into something that mattered. Did they matter? Did He even see them?\n\n…You belong to him who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God (v.4, continued).\n\nWhile the Holy Spirit whispered truth to me, I already knew it; I saw it there in the avocado. Of course, He sees it all. He alone brings life from death, even when it feels like no new fruit will ever will grow in those dry, barren places.\n\nI breathed a prayer of thanks. And then I made guacamole.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 7:14-25, Galatians 5:16-26, 1 John 1:8-10\n\nSure, I was terrible. But it was the fruit flies’ fault.\n\nI’d been at war with them all week, using every trick Google assured me would work. Bowl of vinegar mixed with dish soap? Done. A trap made of fruit and plastic wrap? Yep. Pour diluted bleach down the drain and hope for the best? Affirmative.\n\nI’d done all the entire internet knew to do, to no avail. The fruit flies were multiplying, not disappearing, and I was over it.\n\nI was trying to cook dinner, plotting against the irritating insects in the interim as the pasta boiled and the sauce simmered. I was annoyed—and not just at the state of my kitchen, but at what seemed to be the state of my life. Why couldn’t I just get it all under control already?  \n\nThat’s when David walked in.\n\nI married a good man. He is kind and gracious and funny. And when he walked in the door during my fruit-fly and general-life crisis, I did what any human being would do: I let him have it.\n\nI was as passive-aggressive as I knew how to be and then some. I started slyly with some innocent questions, and then I went in for the kill, attacking his actions and decisions and, in the end, his character. It was awful. I was awful.\n\nHere is what I cannot for the life of me understand: I had no desire to treat my husband with such unkindness and disrespect. I did not stand there in my kitchen, stirring that spaghetti sauce and thinking, When he gets home, I’m going to give him a piece of my mind. Honestly, I don’t know that I’ve ever thought that about him.\n\nI love David. And I love how he loves me. I want nothing but the absolute best for him. But my best intentions were not calling the shots that night. My humanity was.\n\nI’m so grateful for this passage in Romans 7. I’m grateful that God not only knows us fully, but He reassures us of this in His Word. I’m grateful for Paul’s confession that so clearly articulates the struggle I feel in my own heart on a daily basis.\n\nI don’t want to sin. Really, I don’t. But I do it anyway.  \n\nI want to obey the Lord. Really, I do. But I disobey anyway.\n\nPaul’s description of his own sin struggle in Romans 7:14-25 can seem confusing at first read. But read it again, slowly this time. Read it aloud. Do you hear the desperation? Paul, like me (and like you?), does not want to sin. But in and of himself—in his “flesh”—he does not have the ability to be sinless. And he seems pretty frustrated about this. I am, too. Aren’t you?\n\nSin is a disease we are born with but cannot heal. Sin is a slavery we are born into but cannot escape (Romans 3:23; 1 Corinthians 15:22).\n\nSin is a condition we cannot fix. But Jesus can. He has.\n\nThe message of the gospel of Jesus—the gospel that causes Paul to cry, mid-frustration, “Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (v.25)—is that Jesus has rescued us from “this body of death” (v.24). We are more than just our weak-willed bodies; we are souls who have been redeemed by the sinless life and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\n\nYes, we struggle with sin. We struggle to “keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:25), to choose a moment-by-moment life guided by the Spirit of the Lord rather than our selfish desires. But we do not struggle in vain. Our struggle is a fight—a fight to live in the freedom that has already been secured by the Savior who defeated darkness once for all (1 Corinthians 15:55-57).\n\nThanks be to God, for He invites us into a life governed not by our wants or our whims, but by His truth and love.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 8:1-17, Isaiah 53:10, Mark 14:32-36\n\nIndoor plumbing was a luxury in the Haitian village where my adopted daughter, Missy, grew up. And soft, two-ply toilet paper—that was even more rare. When I brought her home to Tennessee, flushing the toilet with copious amounts of Charmin quickly became one of her favorite pastimes.\n\nHow darling!\n\nThat was my thought in those early days as I observed her wide-eyed delight at watching massive plumes of paper spiral downward. But after a while, wading through ankle-deep wastewater in my bathroom and writing large checks to repairmen lost its allure.\n\nSo I was at my wit’s end a couple months ago when I walked into my bathroom—past my innocent-looking daughter splashing in a bubble bath—slipped on the wet tile, and quickly discovered water gushing out of the commode like Niagara Falls. After a heavy sigh, I morphed into the put-upon persona my mother used when I did something especially naughty as a child:\n\nDoggone it, Missy, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU not to use giant gobs of toilet paper like this?!\n\nI angrily set about cleaning up the mess. The entire time I was plunging and fussing and mopping up that yucky pond with beach towels, I had my back turned to Missy.\n\nAs the water and my irritability subsided, I turned around to see my precious little girl staring at me mournfully, big tears streaming down her beautiful brown cheeks. I’d all but crushed her spirit over something innocent and insignificant. She wasn’t trying to cause a mess. She hadn’t been willfully disobedient or disrespectful. This was a plumbing issue—not a heart issue.\n\nI lifted her out of the tub, dried her off with our last dry towel, and rocked her back and forth until she stopped crying. I carefully explained that it was wrong for Mama to raise her voice, that I’d made a very bad choice, and that I was so sorry I’d hurt her feelings.\n\nThat night I called my contractor, who seemed perplexed when I asked, “Hey, Jack, you know those really powerful toilets on cruise ships that sound like they could suck your leg off when you flush them? Can you install one of those in my bathroom?”\n\nLess than forty-eight hours later, our brand-new supersonic vacuum version of a toilet was installed. I cheered so enthusiastically after Missy’s inaugural flush, you’d have thought she’d won an Olympic medal.\n\nOur recent toiletastrophes have reminded me just how much I love, value, and cherish my little girl. They’ve also reminded me of how God the Father loves, values, and cherishes me, His kid.\n\nI’m overwhelmed by the beautiful, redemptive ways He’s moved in my life. How He chose a former Haitian orphan, who lost her first mom to AIDS and never knew her biological father, to effectively rip out the last stubborn roots of the orphaned, fatherless spirit that have been growing in my own heart since long before I was Missy’s age.\n\nFor those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory\n\n(Romans 8:14-17, NIV).\n\nChildren. Heirs. Coheirs with Christ.\n\nGod continues to employ my unlikely, only-by-grace, position of motherhood as a constant, colorful illustration of how He cheers Himself hoarse over every ungainly cartwheel we do (Zephaniah 3:17). How He leans down and hangs on every word of our mostly narcissistic prayers. How—despite our proclivity to make huge messes—He is so completely for us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebekah Lyons\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 8:18-25, Isaiah 65:17, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Revelation 21:1-6\n\nIt begins as far back as we can remember. Right before we run off to school, we smear on our mama’s lip gloss and clamp down as many hair clips as our endless bangs will allow. We hope for another attempt to fit in with the others, to measure up, to belong.\n\nGrowing up, I often found myself hanging in the balance between enjoying the moment and anticipating the next one. As a young child, my hopes centered around a 25-cent soft serve ice cream cone after church on Sunday nights. My hopes matured as I did—working to make the swim team, racing to the finish line at a track meet, striving to win an award. I hoped for slumber party invitations, a certain new sweater for Christmas and, of course, beating my brother at checkers.\n\nThose early years of putting my best foot forward, I hoped the appearance of having it all together would win me friends. But years down the line, the stakes of life loomed larger, and deep heartache entered in—nevermind the lip gloss or hair clips.\n\nIn truly tragic moments, our hope is put to the test. And if it’s misplaced, it will be found wanting. \n\nThe hope we read about in Romans offers us a greater understanding of the hope God offers. It takes us from tangible evidence we can see, and pushes us deeper into a faith that asks for what we cannot see. In fact, all of creation is wired for this. If something breaks, we are hardwired to figure out a solution. Most problems can’t be solved in a day, so we work and test and try until we receive the desired outcome. But there will always be a hope offered by God that requires all of Him, and no amount of our working and testing will bring it to pass. This is the hope of Christ, our Rescuer and Redeemer.\n\nBecause of Christ, we are free to hope in even the most difficult or uncertain circumstances. In the first chapter of his epistle, James tells us to “consider it a great joy” whenever we face trials because the testing of our faith produces spiritual endurance (vv. 2-3). Trials are accompanied by hope. Hope is a gift. Hope is critical, and the gospel gives it to us in unending supply.\n\nNow in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience (Romans 8:24-25).\n\nAny suffering we endure here and now is incomparable to God’s coming glory (Romans 8:18). The measure of trials we have endured directly relates to the measure of hope we offer the world. This is the beautiful gift of hope.\n\nOne day our groans will give way to glory. While we wait, we place our hope in Jesus.\n\nHe will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away (Revelation 21:4).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 8:26-39, Psalm 44:17-22, Philippians 1:6, 2 Thessalonians 2:14\n\nI hope your summer fun list includes a trip to an amusement park or two. Nothing gets the blood pumping quite like circling a track at 100 miles per hour while simultaneously crying, laughing, and screaming. That’s good stuff.\n\nBut before you fill the water bottles and load the kids into the minivan for a day of sweltering, screaming fun, I need to let you in on a secret your brain already knows.\n\nIt starts with a feeling sociologists call “museum feet.” It’s a phenomenon our brains experience when we’re in a big space like an amusement park or a museum. It’s a general sense of being lost or exhausted that comes from hanging out in such a large space.\n\n“Museum feet” could give park-goers a bad experience, causing them to leave the park and not return. But architects have learned that if they include a large visual landmark, we’re less likely to become overwhelmed. They’re looking out for us, and their bottom line, by ensuring we’re willing to stay on the grounds long enough to fork over the cash for overpriced lemonade and nachos.\n\nThink about it: Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World. Spaceship Earth at Epcot Center. The 150-foot “Big Wheel” Ferris wheel at Six Flags. Each offers their own brand of fun, sure, but they also give a reference point to come back to, something to focus on when we feel overwhelmed, overtired, or just over it.\n\nPaul never made it to Disney World, but he must’ve known a thing or two about feeling anxious, overwhelmed, or disoriented. Here, in Romans chapter 8, he shoots up a flare of truth for the believer to come back to every time we feel the same.\n\nAnd we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28).\n\nIf this is one of those feel-good verses that’s become so familiar you’re tempted to race past it—STOP. This is the mother lode, friends! If God can use all things for our good and His glory, nothing can knock us off kilter. He makes us sure-footed. It’s the kind of steady posture that caused Paul to restate the truth of Romans 8:28 for the church in Philippi.\n\nI am sure of this, that he who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus (Philippians 1:6).\n\nPaul is describing the process of redemption—that supernatural metamorphosis whereby God makes all things new. Paul was so anchored in the gospel that no wind could capsize him. That’s not new news, but this may be: the steadiness of Paul is possible for us too.\n\nGod’s promise in Romans 8:28 means He’s already at work, reshaping everything for our good. Tribulation, persecution, famine—God can redeem all of these and more (v.35). Nothing can stop the redemption process (vv.38-39). Not death, not life, not angels or rulers. Not this moment or all the tomorrows to come. Nothing can stop God from working all things for good—not even you.\n\nLife is big. It’s easy to feel lost or overwhelmed or like we want off the ride, but God’s truth anchors us against museum feet. The story of redemption gives us a point to come back to when we feel alone or afraid. The next time you feel overwhelmed, overtired, or just plain over it, look up. The same cross that steadied Paul in the face of unthinkable trials will steady you.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "God’s Mercy and Compassion",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 9:1-19, Exodus 32:30-32, Ephesians 1:3-6\n\nYou’ve probably been there—that terrible moment when you feel like you’re watching a train about to wreck. Your roommate chooses to stay in a toxic relationship. Your child makes a series of self-destructive decisions. Your brother or sister persists in a state of total denial. Your friend walks away from God.\n\nHelplessness is a special kind of agony, especially when it comes to our loved ones. This is the agony Paul expresses in Romans 9 about the choices of Israel. Having had his eyes opened to the light of the gospel, Paul realizes with great anguish that many of his people—God’s people—have not awakened to the good news of Jesus Christ. Theologian N. T. Wright describes Paul’s reaction this way: “[Paul] was like someone driving in convoy who takes a particular turn in the road and then watches in horror as most of the other cars take the other fork.”\n\nPaul’s sorrow is so great that he would rather take their place: “I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the benefit of my brothers and sisters” (v.3). This chapter, then, is not a cold, calculating explanation of Israel’s history and fate. Instead, Paul is wrestling with the mysterious ways of God, and he doesn’t arrive at many neat and tidy conclusions.\n\nIn Romans 9, Paul engages some complex theological questions, but if we zoom in a bit and look at his heart, we might recognize our own. Most of us have walked in Paul’s shoes—grieving the rebellion, blindness, or self-destruction of someone we love. From Paul’s own wrestling with heartache, we can discern two spiritual principles:\n\n1. None of us can boast. None of us stands on moral high ground. God’s grace was not extended to us on the basis of human merit, but divine mercy. That is the principle Paul points to throughout the history of Israel: Isaac, not Ishmael; Jacob, not Esau. These men, these chosen ones who constituted the line of Abraham, were not selected because of their outstanding moral character, but because of the free compassion of God. As Paul explains, “It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy” (v.16). In other words, none of us can pat ourselves on the back for our good choices or our strong faith, while silently judging others. It is all a gift, so that none of us should boast.\n\n2. God is sovereign. The relationship between God’s power and our free will is a mysterious one, indeed. But when it comes to the decisions of a loved one, God’s sovereignty removes a great deal of weight from our shoulders. Namely, we cannot force someone to make the right choice. We cannot yell someone into wisdom. We cannot wrestle someone into agreeing with us. And we cannot compel transformation. There is only One who directs the streams of human hearts, and that is God alone.\n\nThe sovereignty of God does not permit us to become callous, nor does it permit complacency. Like Paul, we should mourn destruction whenever we encounter it. But it can relieve us of a burden we were never meant to bear.\n\nOnly God knows the whole picture and the entire story. Our task is to share the good news to the best of our ability, in humility, and then prayerfully leave the rest to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 9:20-33, Jeremiah 18:1-6, Ephesians 1:11-14\n\nI did an internship in Washington D.C. the summer before my junior year in college. The job was good enough; I coordinated summer camp logistics for kids interested in politics. Yes, it was as nerdy as you’re imagining, and yes, I was a former attendee. But the best thing about that summer wasn’t licking envelopes and herding hormones. It was meeting a new group of friends at church.\n\nI don’t know if you’re familiar with the town of Stars Hollow from the TV show Gilmore Girls, but those quirky, fictional characters had nothing on my new, real-life friends. Despite the fact that I was a stranger in town, and only planning to stay for eight weeks, they grafted me in, constantly hounding me to join them for weekend adventures of camping, floating down rivers, or taking long motorcycle rides through the Shenandoah Valley. It was as dreamy as it sounds, and healing for my soul in many, many ways.\n\nWe talked about the gospel, too, and one of those conversations led to the topic of the providence of God—what some call “predestination.” The candor of the conversation shocked me. Who talks about this stuff anyway? And what does the providence of God even mean?\n\nI was kindly pointed to today’s passage in Romans, and from there one friend explained the idea that God knows, plans, and orchestrates everything. All the days ordained for me (and you, for that matter) were written in His book before one of them came to be (Psalm 139:16). We are God’s workmanship created to do good works that He prepared in advance for us to do (Ephesians 2:10). Salvation itself is a righteousness that comes by faith, and even that comes from Him.\n\nAt face value, the concept that God is in control of everything might seem offensive. We humans have a cosmic authority problem. We don’t like to believe that Someone else has the final say in our lives. When Paul asks in Romans 9:20, “Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’”, I want to scream, “Yes! That’s what my prayers to God sound like on a regular basis!” But if we are to take Romans 9 to heart, we have to concede that God is ultimately the one in control of His creation.\n\nIn the years since my dream summer in D.C., I’ve learned a lot about faith. I’ve read much more of the Bible. I’ve spent countless hours with Jesus. And despite all that, God’s providence is as mysterious to me now as it was then. But I do know this: I would rather believe in a loving God who is fulfilling His purpose for me, than a cosmic universe that is inflicting its chaos on me.\n\nI look at the seasons, coming and going in their time. I look at the ocean waves, which know their boundaries. I look at my face in the mirror—imperfect, yes, but a masterpiece in the Master’s hands. I look at the miracles of birth and life and death. None of it is a mistake. This beauty is His creation, and He is sovereign.\n\nIf we trust Him—if we believe His love—we can put away our questions of Why did you make me like this? and put on the posture of Thy will be done.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 10:1-21, Isaiah 52:7, Joel 2:32, Galatians 3:7-14\n\nI sat on the plush, cream-colored sofa, helping my mentor fold laundry while her two-year-old played on the floor. I was a senior in college, involved in campus ministry and leading a Bible study, and I enthusiastically updated her on both endeavors. I’d begun telling yet another story when she calmly interrupted me with a simple, matter-of-fact statement: “You believe in a works-based gospel.” \n\nWe’d known each other a while, and her statement stunned me. Was she serious? \n\nI quickly brushed it off in the moment. But later that week, I found myself kneeling by the side of my bed, soaking my plaid, purple bedspread with tears. She was right. \n\nThere I was, wallowing in my sin, wanting desperately to be back in the loving arms of my Savior. I had asked for forgiveness, but the relief wasn’t coming. As I poured my guilty conscience onto the pages of my journal, I was struck by one word: time.\n\nThat’s what I thought I needed: time. I didn’t really want forgiveness. I wanted time—enough time to fill my life up with the right things, the good things, to settle the score. It was salvation by works at its worst. \n\nAll my striving, all my desire to put time between myself and my mistakes, it was another attempt to earn my salvation through my own effort. Rather than trusting the work of Christ on the cross for my righteousness, I had become dependent on my own actions to save me.\n\nI was living exactly like the Israelites Paul describes in Romans 10:\n\nSince they are ignorant of the righteousness of God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to God’s righteousness (v. 3).\n\nAfter Christ’s death and resurrection, Israel was still working hard to keep the Law of Moses in order to gain righteousness. They were working to save themselves, forgetting that “Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes” (v. 4). \n\nThe law, our works, the right things—they were never supposed to save us. God had planned our salvation and redemption through Jesus Christ all along. Christ is the only perfect fulfillment, the only victory we have over sin and death. His perfect life allows us to be justified through our faith alone. Faith and nothing else, just Jesus—this is the message of Christ.\n\n“For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (v. 13). \n\nAs I knelt beside my bed that day, I realized Jesus truly was all I needed. His sacrifice covered me then, despite all my striving, and it covers me today. I need His righteousness, not my own. He is enough. \n\nFriends, no matter what our past, present, or future holds, the only work that can save us is the work Christ completed on the cross. May we call on His name.\n\nOne believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation (v. 10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 11:1-24, Hosea 14:4-7, Ephesians 2:8-9\n\nThe first time I read Romans 11, I saw God as very kind. \n\nBut today, that kindness seems far away—30,000 miles below me, to be exact. This time, I’m reading Romans from seat 12B, squished between two strangers. And the pilot has just warned us that “significant turbulence” is ahead. \n\nA hush fell over the cabin in that awkward “I’m playing it cool” kind of way. Because it’s totally going to be fine. I mean, how likely is that whole “unlikely” in-case-of-an-emergency situation, anyway?\n\nWe’re all eyeing the flight attendants to gauge their uneasiness.\n\nJust when you’ve settled into your seat and become comfortable with God’s kindness, the winds shift. His tender mercies can also feel severe. Regardless of how much we show it, we’re all afraid of crashing.\n\nThe Romans were afraid of this too. After all, Israel had taken a hard fall following God’s rejection, so it only seemed natural for this band of new believers to begin bracing themselves for a similar emergency landing. They were afraid that if God didn’t turn out to be who He said He was, they’d have to take matters into their own hands. \n\nIt’s in moments like these that sweet songs about God’s kindness and goodness do not trump the truth about His severity. Just like we need the fullness of God’s character, we need to know the fullness of His Truth.\n\nAlthough the pilot reassures us that everything is under control, I’m tempted to entertain anxious questions. Did they check the plane to make sure it was safe before we boarded? Is the pilot keeping something from us? Is everything really just fine?\n\nWhen bad things happen that we don’t understand, are we just naïve to keep hoping? Will God reject us like He rejected Israel? It’s when we face the unknown that we find out how well we trust God’s character… which brings me to Jello.\n\nCreated by pilot and therapist Captain Tom Bunn to illustrate turbulence, the Jello Exercise compares a plane’s high-traveling, air-thickening speeds to being encased in Jello. While turbulent bumps may make you feel like you’re falling from the sky, it’s actually more like tapping the top of a Jello mold: the plane can bounce up and down, but it cannot fall. In fact, it barely moves at all. Regardless of the bumps, the plane is sustained, completely, by a force we can’t even see. \n\nSo are God’s people.\n\n“Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, though a wild olive branch, were grafted in among them and have come to share in the rich root of the cultivated olive tree, do not boast that you are better than those branches. But if you do boast—you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you” (Romans 11:17-18).\n\nIt is by grace that we cannot fully comprehend what it takes to sustain us. Not only does God know exactly what it takes, but in His kindness He sent Jesus to endure the severity for us. When love isn’t taken lightly, grace must also be severe.\n\nIt takes an intense, thickening wind to keep a plane steady in the clouds. It takes a kind, severe God to sustain us for His glory. Today, He is not only kind, but also severe, and exactly Who we need.\n\n“The people will return and live beneath his shade. They will grow grain and blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon” (Hosea 14:7).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 11:25-36, Isaiah 40:13-15, 1 Corinthians 12:4-11\n\nPerhaps you’ve heard the not-so-fairy-tale-like stories of the children of Israel. Like the one where God rescued them from slavery, and they responded by grumbling about the flavors missing from their menu (Numbers 11). Or the one where they got impatient with Moses as he met with God on Mt. Sinai, so they decided to worship a golden calf (Exodus 32). Or the time when they came to the border of the promised land and listened to their knees knocking and hearts racing, instead of listening to the voice of God (Numbers 13).\n\nWhen we flip forward in our Bibles to the New Testament, we find God’s people still stuck in the ruts of rejection and rebellion. It was, after all, the Jewish leaders who led the charge to have Jesus arrested, tried, convicted, and crucified (Matthew 26:3-5). After the resurrection, they remained resolute in their opposition of Jesus, doing everything in their power to squelch the message of the Church. \n\nYet here in Romans 11, Paul reminds us that despite their chronic grumbling and wilderness wandering, despite their golden calf worshipping and Savior scourging, the Jewish people remain God’s “beloved” (v. 28). \n\nOur human logic may balk at this, but Paul warns against trusting only what makes sense to our brains (Romans 11:25). Try as we might, we cannot understand God’s love using our flawed standards for love and acceptance. Chapter after chapter, verse after verse, the story of God’s commitment to His chosen people doesn’t make sense. Human understanding leaves us wondering, Why did God choose them? But through the lens of the gospel, the story of the Jews suddenly makes sense. Look at Deuteronomy 7:6-8.\n\n“For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth” (v. 6).  \n\nLean in. Listen closely to this next part. \n\n“It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all the peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath he swore to your fathers. . .” (vv. 7-8).\n\nGod knew His beloved were weak and frail—incapable of keeping their side of the covenant. Still He chose them, loves them, and keeps His promises to them. \n\nThe Bible is not the story of a wayward people but of a faithful God. \n\nIn the shadow of the cross, we are God’s chosen people. Because of the gospel, our identity has been changed from “not my people” to “my people” (Romans 9:25). Christ’s sacrifice made a way for us to be among the “beloved.” The gifts God has lavished upon us are so extravagant, and we are so undeserving, that we sometimes worry He’ll take them back. But “God’s gracious gifts and calling are irrevocable” (Romans 11:29). \n\nThe depth of God’s wisdom is matched only by the depth of His love. He has promised unfathomable gifts to us and He will never snatch them back. If every one of God’s acts of love and faithfulness toward the Jewish people could be contained, they’d overflow the seas. We, too, can stand on the shore and see the unmistakable faithfulness of God. \n\nWe are weak.\n\nWe are wayward. \n\nAnd yet, the Prince and the kingdom are irrevocably ours.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jill McDaniel\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 12:1-8, Hebrews 13:15-16, Ephesians 4:1-16\n\nPersonal discipline isn’t one of my stronger giftings. To put it another way, I stink at it.\n\nI’m the one in my family who excitedly asks, “Who wants to go get ice cream?” rather than stick to our sensible meal plan. I’m notorious for drafting a shiny new routine that lasts for three days before I’m ready for spontaneity again. Despite my best efforts to implement structure in my life, I’m all over the place. I’ve come to accept that flexibility is just part of who God made me to be.\n\nBut here’s the truth. For me, that acceptance spills over into a lack of spiritual discipline. The world tells us that fulfilling our every desire or whim in the moment is a sign of happiness, success, and freedom. But I can say from experience that ignoring spiritual disciplines only leads to chains, not freedom.\n\nPaul warns us, “Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,” and I find myself staring longingly at his words (Romans 12:2). I want that. I want my body—my whole self—to be “a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God” (v. 1).\n\nI tried renewing my mind by attending church, but I didn’t make time to engage with God at home. I’d sit half-dazed in front of my computer, reading about fall fashion trends rather than reading my Bible. I’d watch one more episode of my favorite show and skip my prayer time. I wanted to read my Bible and pray and live out Romans 12:2, but my propensity for distraction and gluttony grew. I couldn’t control them on my own, no matter how guilty I felt or how many times I vowed to change.\n\nI’d forgotten that only God can transform my heart. And that transformation takes place in the context of the body of Christ, His Church—not just out here on my own, accompanied only by my best intentions.    \n\nMaybe your struggle is the opposite of mine, and routine and productivity are the desires that take the place of true renewal. Or perhaps your days are bound by a structure that you don’t want God to bend, a rigidity where spending time with Him in Scripture and in prayer are items on a checklist rather than intimate interaction with your heavenly Father. Whatever your personality, spiritual disciplines are tools that lift our eyes from our circumstances and desires and focus our hearts on God’s presence. Prayer, fasting, Bible study—they’re all disciplines that renew our minds and refresh our spirits. But unlike a resolution, a diet, or an exercise regimen, they aren’t sustained by our willpower.\n\nTrue spiritual growth is rooted in the Spirit’s work in us, not in our effort. God is the Giver. We are the recipient. He empowers. We surrender. We do this individually, as God’s daughters and sons, and we do this corporately, as His children and Church.\n\nMay we truly worship the Lord today by offering Him our whole selves, surrendering our desires to His will and our efforts to His strength, “according to the grace given to us” (Romans 12:6). Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 12:9-21, Matthew 5:44-47, 1 Corinthians 4:6-13\n\nReading Paul’s list of exhortations to the Romans makes me tired. Seriously. Rid your life of hypocrisy. Love deeply. Outdo one another in showing honor. Do not lack diligence in zeal. Share with the saints. Pursue hospitality. Live at peace with everyone…\n\nWith everyone? Really?\n\nDude. Paul. I need some coffee. And also, when am I supposed to binge-watch my TV shows?\n\nIn all honesty, when I compare my life to the lives of the disciples, I begin to see why Paul fills 1 Corinthians 4:6-13 with so much irony. I practically live like a queen compared to Christ’s beloved friends back in the day, and compared to much of the world today. Most of my time is spent concerned about how I’ll choose to spend my time.\n\nI catch myself daydreaming about the life the world tells me I should have: a life with a passionate (never rocky) marriage to my soulmate, a clean and immaculate house, a career that’s advancing, children that are thriving, and plenty of time at the gym maintaining the body of a teenager. To top it off, the world tells me I need to portray this “perfect” life to the world on social media, to attract more followers.\n\nWith this world as my guide, adding Paul’s list to the mix is absolutely impossible. There are not enough hours in the day to do both what the world demands of me and what God desires for me. And so I have to choose.\n\nEvery single day I have to choose whom I will serve: my flesh or my God. Some days I make the right choice. Some days I make the wrong one. This is the life of a work in progress, one that God promises to bring to completion in His time (Philippians 1:6).\n\nPerhaps that’s why Paul tells us to “cling to what is good” (Romans 12:9). If good was an easy, simple thing to hold onto, why would he tell us to cling to it? I know that in my own life, if I’m not clinging to God, the natural inclination of my heart is one of jealousy, coveting, and destructive daydreams. So while it seems like what Paul is cautioning us to do should be obvious, I know it to be oh-so difficult to put into practice. Detest what is evil; cling to what is good. I know that If I’m clinging to something, then I’m desperate, grasping. I’m holding on for dear life.\n\nThese passages remind me that my very life is at stake, and that evil really is evil. Paul pokes at my carefully built life, reminding me that Christ’s path of goodness and stillness and quietness is the only route to peace. I can rest knowing that the battle is the Lord’s. But I can’t assume that rest and peace will come without effort on my part, without my choosing God. I must cling to Him and let go of everything else.\n\nDear Lord, help me to hold on.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Christian Duty",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 13:1-14, Daniel 2:19-23, Hebrews 11:32-40\n\nThe Bible is filled with the stories of people who have defied authority. Moses stood up to Pharaoh then led the Israelites out of Egypt. Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego all refused to worship any other god but Yahweh—and were then thrown into the lions’ den and fiery furnace, respectively. (Spoiler alert: God saved them all, and for His glory.)\n\nStephen defied the ruling Jewish Council, preached the gospel of Jesus, and was stoned to death for it. Paul and other apostles were martyred by the Roman government during the persecution of Christians.\n\nAnd yet this same Paul, who likely later died at the hands of his government, urges believers to honor and respect those in authority. Paul—who knew many examples throughout Jewish history of standing up to corrupt rulers—says to obey, seemingly without question. What are we to make of this?\n\nOf course, it’s natural to wonder, What if the government was urging murder, stealing, or some other form of not loving one’s neighbor? What if the ruling authorities were, as Nebuchadnezzar did, asking their people to bow down to another god? Or no god at all?\n\nScripture has given us plenty of evidence that Christ is the ultimate authority in heaven and on earth. Paul isn’t contradicting that here. What he is doing in Romans 13, is laying down a foundation for Christian living—reminding us that our ultimate authority is Jesus. Our first and truest loyalty is to Him.\n\nPeter gives a similar exhortation in 1 Peter 2. After telling the people, “you are a chosen race, a holy priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession” (v. 9), he says:\n\nSubmit to every human authority because of the Lord, whether to the emperor as the supreme authority or to governors as those sent out by him to punish those who do what is evil and to praise those who do what is good… Honor everyone. Love the brothers and sisters. Fear God. Honor the emperor (vv. 13-14,17).\n\nPeter starts by reminding believers of who they are: the body of Christ, a holy nation of God that extends beyond borders. This is a beautiful truth for us to cling to as well, especially in times of deep confusion, national partisanship, and turmoil within our own institutions.\n\nBoth Peter and Paul tell early Christians to honor their government, but they do so in the context of the whole story of Scripture (and their own writings), affirming that Jesus is Lord over all. Therefore, we obey the government when it doesn’t contradict God’s commands—and we do it joyfully, as a way of honoring God.\n\nJohn Piper says it this way: “And it is very important to stress that, just as we may have to disobey the civil authorities for Christ’s sake, so all our obedience should be for His sake as well. We never have two masters … Every time we say yes to any law, it should be a yes to Jesus.”\n\nOur every action should be motivated by our identity as followers of Christ and citizens of God’s kingdom:\n\nThe night is nearly over, and the day is near; so let us discard the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. Let us walk with decency, as in the daytime: not in carousing and drunkenness; not in sexual impurity and promiscuity; not in quarreling and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and don’t make plans to gratify the desires of the flesh (Romans 13:12-14).\n\nThe Bible offers many examples of what godly citizenship looks like in an earthly kingdom. Let us pray continually that we will seek first God’s Kingdom, listening to the promptings of the Holy Spirit as we engage thoughtfully with our own earthly governments. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Annie Downs\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 14:1-12, Colossians 2:16-17, Hebrews 10:19-25\n\nToday is my birthday. It’s a day I really love. Tonight my friends and I are headed to watch the Nashville Sounds play minor league baseball. There, I will hug everyone too many times, introduce friends who don’t already know one another, drink multiple Coke ICEEs, and maybe catch a foul ball. Then I will fall into bed tonight sure that I’m the luckiest woman alive.\n\nMy life is far from perfect. But the life I’ve spent 37 years putting together is turning out alright. Not perfect, not problem-free, but pretty awesome nonetheless.\n\nThe older I get, the more I draw boundaries in my life, making it the life I want to live. Some of my life rules wouldn’t work for you, and I’m okay with that. For starters, I’m dairy-free (it’s an allergy thing), but I wouldn’t ask you—or any of my friends at my birthday party—to live without milk, let alone eat cake WITHOUT ice cream. That beautiful stuff should never go to waste!\n\nThen there’s the matter of rest. My day off each week is almost always a Wednesday. That doesn’t mean it needs to be your weekly day to rest. It simply means Wednesdays work best for me.\n\nAnd then there’s the soccer. I watch it every chance I get. But you don’t have to do the same. Though, I’d highly recommend it because it’s just the best. Period.\n\n The beauty of maturing, and also growing up in my faith, is that I no longer want to look like you. In high school I wanted to look like you, sound like you, and like what you like. Not now. Now, I want to live MY life. I want to look like me—the best, healthiest, kindest, truest version of me. There’s this thing we get to do whenever we’re tired of comparing our lives to other people’s lives: we get to live our own.\n\n You know what it is? It’s the difference between bondage and freedom. Freedom is not a life without boundaries or borders or rule. It’s a life full of the good kind of boundaries, the kind that keep you healthy and strong, living the life God made you to live. It’s the life that is uniquely yours.\n\nFor none of us lives for himself, and no one dies for himself. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord (Romans 14:7-8).\n\nWe often think freedom as just wide open space. But I’ve never found that to be true. Real freedom is found in knowing Jesus. It is giving yourself permission to live wide open in the spaces where God has placed you and in the ways He has made you. My fences around my spaces are going to look different from yours, but there is such safety and health and permission inside the boundaries built just for you.\n\nScripture tells us that if we’re Christ-followers, then the life we get to live belongs to Him  anyway. Galatians 2:20 says, “The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.”\n\nThat right there—living for Jesus—is living your best life.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 14:13-23, 1 Corinthians 8:8-13, Ephesians 4:25-32, Ephesians 5:1-2\n\nI’ve always heard this passage in Romans 14 interpreted according to clothing, music, alcohol, smoking, and more—all in terms of “not being a stumbling block for others.” I was tender to my power to be a stumbling block of every sort, both to the believing and the unbelieving, checking over my shoulder to see the carnage I’d left in my wake. Truth was, I left hardly any, but it didn’t stop me from metaphorically cutting off arms and legs, gouging out eyes and the like, in pursuit of protecting my brothers and sisters.\n\nThe Christian life, I thought, was more about what I couldn’t do than what I could.\n\nHow glorious, then, when the true gospel began to take root in my heart. I began to understand that freedom in Christ meant I was truly free to live. As it turns out, Christ had declared me more than clean. He’d declared me redeemed.\n\nFor all the ways I’d formerly applied this passage, though, the one I’d not considered was food. I knew all food had been declared clean, that we’re no longer under the law of Moses in our dietary restrictions. But what I didn’t understand was the law of our current world with regard to food: the diet and exercise industry. Everywhere I look, the acceptable Christian message of caring for the temple of the Holy Spirit turns into what I imagine Paul might’ve called the “god of the belly” (Philippians 3:19).\n\nIn Philippians 3, Paul warns of the dangers of gluttony. But today, in modern culture, the opposing god—though a no less despicable one—is the one who demands less food, more restrictions, better supplements, flatter stomachs, tighter abs, and the list goes on. In an attempt to care for the temples of the Holy Spirit with eating and exercising, we can destroy our bodies (which are wasting away, whether we like it or not) and cause harm to the impressionable hearts and minds of others who jump on every new regime or diet we offer.\n\nWe want to be well, to eat healthy, whole, good food. We love the rhythms of feasting and fasting we see in Scripture. We want to move our bodies, staying limber and active. But we don’t want to destroy our hearts by lusting after what we don’t have: slimmer physiques and sculpted thighs. We don’t want to destroy our bodies by rebounding from one quick-fix supplement to another. We don’t want to destroy our minds by believing our approval comes from certain lifestyles or appearances.\n\nThere are countless difficulties in life, opportunities to be divided over race, gender, theology, and history. And food, instead of becoming a means to crush those divides—to draw near to one another, armed with soups, fruits, breads, vegetables, and meats—has become one more line of division.\n\nChrist died for all; this is what the Bible says. I don’t want to be known by what I eat or don’t eat. I want to be known by how I love and Who I’m loved by.\n\nSo then, let us pursue what promotes peace and what builds up one another. Do not tear down God’s work because of food (Romans 14:19-20).\n\nWhatever struggle you’re caught in the throes of today, know that you are loved by Christ. He spread His own body, bleeding and broken, to fit a cross you could never bear on your own. Don’t destroy your own body by what you do or don’t eat. Christ died for all—every curve, every bulge, and every stretch-mark—all of it.\n\nFor “the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit” (Romans 14:17). God gives us food as a means of provision, not division. Instead of fostering false divisions today, let’s bake a cake, make a soup or a sandwich, and share it with someone in the pursuit of peace.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 15:1-21, 2 Samuel 22:50-51, Psalm 117:1-2\n\nSome of my fondest memories as a kid include long summer days spent at the pool. These memories are filled with flipping off the diving board, shouting “Marco Polo,” and of course, playing King of the Mountain. The goal of King of the Mountain was to be the only one on top of the raft, ruling your kingdom by any means necessary. Growing up with brothers, I had to be scrappy and strategic to win at this brutal game. From a young age, I learned that only the strong survive.\n\nI’m told that as a grown-up, it’s not cool to push people off rafts at the pool. The thing is though, we still want to be on top. We just have different rafts now, and we’ve learned to defend our turf in more covert, “polite” ways. \n\nSo much of how we respond has to do with the season we’re in. When we’re treading water, we hope and pray for a gracious hand to help us onto the raft. But when we’re on top, it’s easy to become prideful in our position. It gets especially ugly when we believe there isn’t enough room on the raft for everyone. Even in the Church, we can foster the belief that the kingdom of God only has space for the “good” people, whether we’re conscious of it or not. \n\nIn our reading for today, Paul was writing to a Roman church comprised of two very different people groups: the Jews and the Gentiles. Even from its earliest days, it seems there were divisions amongst the believers in that region. Those who were “strong” didn’t want to help those they considered weak. But Paul challenged the Romans to accept one another, just as Christ had accepted them (Romans 15:7).\n\nPaul points out that even the strongest among us, Jesus Christ, did not use His power to please Himself. If anybody had a right to boast it was the Lord, yet He took our weakness upon Himself to the point of sacrificing His very life. \n\nWe are all in need of God’s grace. In that humility we can seek to be like Jesus, freely passing on the strength and encouragement that has been gifted to us. If the Lord of the universe humbled Himself and bore our weaknesses, how much more eager should we be to do the same for those whom He’s placed around us?\n\nIn addition to following the sacrificial example of Jesus, Paul also calls the Roman church to accept one another for the glory of God. When we’re competitive and exclusive in our churches, how do you suppose we’re seen from the outside? Our witness is compromised by our selfishness. But if we’re a countercultural people and can demonstrate with love and sincerity that there is room at the table of God, then we will have something divinely different to offer.\n\nIt’s tempting to believe the lie of this world, that we must fight to be on top. But in the kingdom of God there is always enough for everyone. As believers, we’re called to lay down our lives for others just as Christ did, to love both the strong and the weak. If we stop trying to protect our little rafts, together we will glorify and join in celebration with the one true King, who lives and reigns over all the mountains. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melissa Zaldivar\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 15:22-33, Isaiah 52:14-15, Hebrews 2:2-4\n\nI like to know what’s coming—what could happen and what my options are. I think constantly about what works and what doesn’t. In short, plans are my jam.\n\nIn my final year of seminary, a job opportunity arose. It was one of those really great, safe jobs that worked in all the practical ways. I would have a plan—in case, you know, God didn’t come through. I walked through the interview process until the final meeting, when we were to discuss terms for my employment. That morning I confessed to God that I was more concerned about my five-year plan than His plans for me. Then I did what I knew I had to do: I walked into that last interview and said, “This is just not where I need to be.” \n\nAt first, I felt amazing, like that scene in The Devil Wears Prada where Anne Hathaway throws her cell phone into the fountain. Life felt extraordinary, like I was jumping off of the proverbial cliff of my ordinary, planned-out life into the unknown. Later, as I sat alone, it hit me: I had no backup plan and only a few months until graduation. Panic set in, and I did what most of us do in crisis. I told absolutely no one that I was struggling.\n\nOne Sunday, my friend Laura cornered me at church. She barely had to acknowledge the look on my face before I spilled my doubts and fears of being a failure and a fool. I felt shame. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t even know how I was going to buy groceries that week.\n\nLaura didn’t miss a beat. She saw past the facade and grabbed my arm, looked me in the eye and said, “I don’t have an answer for you. But I can tell you that God is with you. Even when you can’t believe that, I’ll believe it for you.” Laura reminded me of the blessing that is mine as a follower of Jesus—a peace greater than my plans. \n\nPaul’s life was filled with adventure and excitement (think: shipwrecks and jail time) but he, too, was created for community. In Romans 15:23-24, he writes, “I have strongly desired for many years to come to you whenever I travel to Spain. For I hope to see you when I pass through and to be assisted by you for my journey there, once I have first enjoyed your company for a while.” In these moments we catch glimpses of Paul’s ordinary life, even in the midst of extraordinary journeys. \n\nI imagine he felt lonely at times. I wonder if part of him didn’t want to admit his own struggles. \n\nIn a moment of need, I didn’t even have the words to ask my friend to pray for me. But Paul’s letter reminds me that gospel community is the life we’re called to. Paul knew firsthand that when we experience fellowship within the body of Christ, we are experiencing the very kingdom of God. “I know that when I come to you,” he said to his fellow believers in Rome, “I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ” (Romans 15:29). Then he asked for their prayers. \n\nMay we be a people who confess aloud how much we need Jesus, and push one another back into His presence. We don’t simply write postcards from a distance and wish one another luck or prosperity. No, we have the honor of inviting each other to encounter the living God, the giver of salvation and peace.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 16:1-16, John 13:16, 1 Peter 5:14\n\nOf all of the roles I’ve had in my life, my least favorite, without a doubt, is “new girl.” \n\nShe’s clumsy and uncertain, always draining her phone battery with GPS directions to the grocery store and back home again. With brave intentions and shy tendencies, she’s perfected the art of introducing herself, yet allows her next-door neighbor to call her the wrong name yet again. She doesn’t know when trash pickup is or where to find the office break room. And her best friend, states away, knows she’s always on call for both late night and early morning pep talks.\n\nI’ve been the new girl enough times to know what makes her feel welcome. Paul has a pretty good idea, too. After all, he could have easily ended the book of Romans with chapter 15, one of the biggest mic-drop opportunities of all time. Instead, he reintroduces us to the gift God gave us in each other. \n\nAfter “amen,” Paul continues on with a crucial reminder: we are not alone. He introduces us to his friends by name, explaining their significance and telling us why we’ll love them. \n\nPhoebe, whom Paul reminds us is already our sister, is on her way to Rome (and may be the one carrying his letter!). He encourages us to befriend her and take care of her during her stay. Priscilla and Aquila, more dear friends, put themselves on the line for our buddy Paul. So, of course, we’re honored to greet them and their church. The list goes on and on, and as it grows, Paul continues to build up God’s people with encouragement, delivering each name as a lifeline to the full body.\n\nIn this intimate portrait of Paul and his fellow believers, we see a lasting truth: The body of Christ is a built-in reminder that redemption is an extraordinary reality for everyday people. \n\nIt’s easy to misread the Bible as “The Book of People Who Had It All Together,” when really, there’s only one Hero in this story. The simple truth is that we all need Jesus, and we all need each other. \n\nIn Romans, Paul emphasizes that God’s plan is good news. But his writing isn’t just for well-versed theologians—it’s for ordinary, faithful people living in small, unseen obedience. It’s for us. If you are in Christ, your name is written there among the greatness and glory of God’s plan.\n\nHere in our temporary home, we never stop being the new girl who needs to relearn grace and remember truth. But praise the Lord—we don’t have to do it alone. \n\nGreetings, friends. And peace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus (1 Peter 5:14).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 16:17-27, Matthew 7:15-20, Jude 24-25\n\nI took a personality test the other day, and I wasn’t thrilled with the results. It confirmed what I already knew: I avoid conflict like the plague. Put me in a tension-filled room and I’ll moonwalk away so fast, you’ll never even know I was there.\n\nI tell you this not to confirm that I was raised in the 80s (which I was), but so you’ll understand why I so desperately want to misinterpret today’s passage from Romans. I’ll show you what I mean.\n\nHere we’ve come to the close of the longest of Paul’s letters. We’ve heard him preach on sin and salvation, grace and faith, and now we’re leaning in to see how he’ll land the plane. What does one say to wrap up what would become known as the most comprehensive expression of the gospel in all of Scripture?\n\nHe begins his conclusion with a warning:\n\nNow I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who create divisions and obstacles contrary to the teaching that you learned. Avoid them… (Romans 16:17).\n\nThis is where my comfort-loving ears perk up. Steer clear of those who cause problems? Avoid conflict at all costs? If that’s what our friend Paul is selling, I’m buying in bulk. But he continues:\n\n…because such people do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites. They deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting with smooth talk and flattering words (v. 18).\n\nNo smooth-talkers allowed? Yep, works for me.\n\nIn my humanity, I want Paul’s words to leave me right where I am: a well-intentioned gal who doesn’t like to rattle or be rattled. I want a divine endorsement for a head-down, hands-off way of living. I want to look to the folks on my right and my left and say, I’m fine. You’re fine. Everything’s fine. In short, I want to read Paul’s words as permission rather than admonition.\n\nHe keeps writing:\n\nThe report of your obedience has reached everyone. Therefore I rejoice over you, but I want you to be wise about what is good, and yet innocent about what is evil. The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you (vv.19-20).\n\nCrushing evil is not a passive activity. Our holy and sovereign God is currently and constantly at work, overcoming darkness with light (John 5:17). As Christ followers, our work is not passive either. We are called to right doctrine and right living—to cling to Christ and to His gospel, shunning all false gods and gospels that beg our worship. This is Paul’s parting reminder.\n\nIt’s true that I’m predisposed to being a coaster—a person who’d rather stay the course than question questionable coordinates. But the gospel Paul presents in this letter is not a matter of right or left. It’s a matter of life and death. The mystery of Jesus Christ has been “revealed and made known through the prophetic Scriptures, according to the command of the eternal God” (Romans 16:26). Our Savior has come. He has opened the way to God, the rescue and restoration of our wrecked, restless souls.\n\nThe truth is, you and I are not fine. We “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). But in God’s great love and compassion, we have been “justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Romans 3:24). What’s more, “since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). \n\nThis is the gospel. This is our hope. \n\nThis is what we cling to, what we live by, what we fight for—to the glory of the One who created us, saved us, and calls us His own.\n\nTo the only wise God, through Jesus Christ—to him be the glory forever! Amen (Romans 16:27).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 1:1-31, Exodus 19:5-6, James 1:18\n\nI work with a truly spectacular group of people, but we don’t always see eye to eye. \n\nJessica, for example, is fiercely protective of words, watching over grammatical details like comma placement and hyphen length with laser-like focus. Ryan, I’m convinced, will defend the creative integrity of the She Reads Truth brand as long as he has breath, and Abby has yet to sit through a meeting without bringing to our attention the needs and desires of you, the Shes who read Truth with us. We all have different jobs, and sometimes it is our job to disagree. \n\nRaechel and I learned this early on in working together, back when it was just the two of us: seeing things differently is a gift to be stewarded, not a tension to be avoided. Today there are eighteen of us at SRT headquarters, each bringing different skills and perspectives to the conference room table. But we are a team. We are here for each other, for the work set before us, and for you. Above all, we are here to hold out God’s Word and bring glory to Him. Our differences help, not hinder, this pursuit. \n\nIt’s easy for me to see God’s provision in the differences among our team members. But I’m embarrassed to admit that I often expect homogeneity in the Church. I find myself frustrated by our differences, bothered that we can’t all agree on large and small aspects of our faith and life as followers of Jesus. I’m saddened when these differences go beyond disagreements to cause division, and discouraged when these divisions are not easily overcome. I forget that God’s Word and perfect wisdom are not diminished by our limited understanding or altered by our various opinions. \n\nIn his letters to the church at Corinth, the Apostle Paul encourages this congregation of young believers to embrace their common and primary identity in Christ. He desires for them to know and act on the truth that “we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body” and “we were all given one Spirit to drink” (1 Corinthians 12:13). The image of the Church as one body appears throughout these letters, making clear Paul’s resounding declaration: We are many, but we are one in Christ. \n\nEven here, in the first chapter of 1 Corinthians, we can sense Paul fighting for the unity of the Church. His tone is somber, even harsh at times, because the topic is not casual; it is critical. God has welcomed us—different as we are, different as we are designed to be—into His family through the grace and power of Jesus Christ. He did not call us because we are wise or powerful or strong. Rather, Christ Jesus “became wisdom from God for us—our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, in order that, as it is written: Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord” (1 Corinthians 1:30-31). We are part of this fellowship by grace alone, and it is by grace that we live and grow in unity with one another.\n\nAs you read 1 & 2 Corinthians, ask the Holy Spirit to open your eyes to see the Church all around you. Ask Him to teach you more about Himself, His body of believers, and the truth of His Word. Like the church at Corinth, we come to this text from a colorful array of backgrounds, experiences, and traditions. But we have a Savior who binds us. May His mercy and grace unite us as we read. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 2:1-16, Romans 8:26-30, Ephesians 1:13-14\n\nI recently listened to an interview with Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia. Wales said he started Wikipedia because he wanted to make information available to everyone for free. Today, I’m sure most of us with an internet connection have benefitted from Wales’s aspirations.\n\nWith Wikipedia, as well as countless other sites on the web, we can know almost anything about any person, place, or thing. It is the Information Age, after all. The Information Age has given us the illusion that we can know everything. It has given us the illusion that we no longer need to grapple with the unknown. And it’s tempting to believe that knowledge—the kind that’s available to us with the click of a button—is equivalent to wisdom.\n\nBut it’s not.\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 2, Paul writes about the difference between the wisdom of men and spiritual wisdom. The wisdom of men is “coming to nothing,” he says. “On the contrary, we speak God’s hidden wisdom in a mystery, a wisdom God predestined before the ages for our glory” (vv.6-7). \n\nPaul then explains that God’s wisdom is no longer hidden in mystery because it has been revealed to us by God’s Spirit. What is this wisdom? In short: “Jesus Christ and him crucified” (v.2). It seems so simple—too simple, especially in the Information Age—for the idea of wisdom to be boiled down to this one simple truth. And yet, this is what Scripture tells us.\n\nThe temptation is to fill up our minds with as much “wisdom” as possible. We gather knowledge in an attempt to be the smartest in the room and because we find security in thinking all of our questions can be answered with a Google search. \n\nBut spiritual wisdom frees us from relying on our own knowledge. It frees us from having to answer every question, and it opens up our lives to the power of the Spirit. In this, paradoxically, Scripture says we are able to “evaluate everything” (v.15). When we are not sure what to do, where to turn or who to talk to, we have the Spirit. When we are confused, disheartened, angry, we have the Spirit. And this Spirit is wisdom. This Spirit gives us more than the entire archive of Wikipedia ever could. It gives us “the mind of Christ” (v.16).\n\nDo you believe you have the mind of Christ? Do you trust the Spirit who has been given to you? Or are you still scrolling the internet looking for answers?\n\nKnowledge is a wonderful tool, and I am grateful to live in an age when we have such ready access to it. But no matter how much knowledge I acquire, it will never measure up to the Holy Spirit within me. That quiet, still, discerning voice. The very Spirit of God who gives me the very mind of Christ. \n\nLet us seek spiritual wisdom first. Let us ask the Spirit for guidance first. Let us cling to our hope that is not in knowledge or the Information Age, but in Christ Himself.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Readings: 1 Corinthians 3:1-23, John 5:24, Romans 5:1\n\nMy first year of high school, I was placed on the junior varsity cheerleading squad. This shouldn’t have been such a big deal. I was a freshman, after all. But most of friends had made it to the varsity squad, where the girls were clad in glittery uniforms, while the JV team only had t-shirts with iron-on decals. \n\nAt the first JV football game of the season, I tumbled across the track, throwing my back handsprings like a circus performer. I wanted to make sure the varsity cheerleaders knew a mistake had been made: clearly, they should have given me a spot on their coveted squad. When I got home that night, exhausted yet satisfied that I’d done the job, my mother let it slip that she’d “enjoyed the Claire show.” Her words stung, but I got the message. I was being prideful, and she’d seen right through my charade.\n\nWhen I think about pride, I often think about myself at that JV game. I was so convinced I deserved a position on the varsity squad that I spent the night showing off, rather than actually paying attention to the football game. After all, football was the whole reason we were there. The cheering was secondary.\n\nPaul calls out the Corinthians on this same kind of sophomoric pride. He calls out their useless squabbling over their allegiance to a teacher—as if by following Paul, they were more righteous than their friends who followed Apollos. Whether they knew it or not, the Corinthians had lost sight of the most important point of all—that is, Jesus—and had turned their focus completely on themselves. \n\nThat’s what pride does. It turns all of our attention inward. \n\nFor adult-me, self-pity is the most common form of pride. When I feel left out by a group of friends, the sadness that creeps up isn’t just sadness at the rejection; it’s also a prideful entitlement, which shouts, I should have been invited! Pride can hide in our allegiances—to particular brands, particular books, particular ways of eating, thinking, or voting. Rigid loyalty to anything other than Christ should alert us to destructive pride hiding beneath the surface.\n\nPaul criticizes the Corinthians for falling victim to that distraction, and he doesn’t mince words. He calls them babies! He says they’re acting like typical, worldly people. And I wonder, Am I really all that different from them?\n\nPerhaps my cheerleading story is a silly example, but I think it applies. When it comes to Christianity, what am I holding onto that is secondary to the gospel of Christ? Do I take pride that I’m a part of a certain Bible study, small group, or online devotion series? Do I feel hurt to be left off of a specific worship team? Do I have allegiance to a certain writer, church community, or social-justice mission? \n\nThose things are all well and good. As Paul says, they might be part of the house we’re building, but they will never be the foundation. The gospel is never Jesus and—it’s only Jesus. When it comes to our faith, Paul calls us to let go of everything that’s not Him.\n\nWe are not typical; we are temples. The Spirit of God lives in us (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). And as such, we need no ornaments. We need no special brands. No special invitations. No special groups or labels. No allegiances to a specific preacher. The foundation is Jesus. Anything else can stay or go; only our pride tells us otherwise.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 4:1-21, Zephaniah 2:3, 1 Peter 5:5\n\nYou don’t have to have a Bible college diploma hanging on your wall. You don’t need a passport stamped from developing countries. Your name need not appear on the official list of staff members for your church. Plant your feet firmly in this truth: If you are a follower of Jesus, you are already a minister for the gospel. Because the stakes are high, this reality can paralyze us. We throw around words like “calling” and “ministry” so often, but we secretly suspect we’re somehow doing it wrong. \n\nWhile confirming our assignment to be followers and leaders, Paul invites us to rest in this call. He offers us a two-word job description for ministry here in 1 Corinthians 4, inviting us to throw giftedness, opportunity, and needs into a pot, and boil ministry down to its very essence. What is ultimately required of us as ministers? To be “servants of Christ and managers of the mysteries of God” (v.1).\n\nWe are “managers of the mysteries of God.” Gulp! That sounds weighty, but in the same passage, Paul warns us “not to go beyond what is written” (v. 6). In other words, stick with Scripture. The mysteries of God we’re responsible to carry are the good news of the gospel and the Word of God. \n\nEvery believer—from the youngest to the oldest among us, both Bible scholars and Bible newbies—is a carrier of the good news with a shared responsibility to know and proclaim the Word. Paul is urging us, as disciples in ministry, to think of the Bible like a treasure. And it is! Like finding a cache of jewels buried in the backyard, we didn’t create this treasure, yet we get to claim it as our own as we carry it and deliver it to both the fellow believers and non-believers we rub elbows with each day. \n\nGod’s Word is a treasure because it reveals who God is. He is supreme, sufficient, spectacular, and in the full-time business of saving us from our sin. This cannot help but bend our knees and turn our hearts. As we steward God’s Word, we step into the other shoe that comes with ministry; we become servants. \n\nWe are willing to serve Christ’s Church because of all He has done for us. We are willing to serve those who don’t know Him by sharing who He is. We are willing to serve each other because we know now, deep in our guts, that none of us deserves a seat at this table. The chord we are bound to is grace, and it makes us want to share it in abundance with one another. \n\nRegardless of your day job, no matter what titles you hold, and in spite of your sin and failures—you are a minister of the gospel if you are in Christ Jesus. His grace is your qualification. So serve faithfully and joyfully the God “who will both bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the intentions of the hearts. And then praise will come to each one from God” (v.5). Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 5:1-13, Leviticus 18:8, Galatians 6:1-10\n\nAre you shocked when you read the latest news headlines? According to Paul’s letter to the Corinthian church, we shouldn’t be surprised at all by the terrible acts of the world. After all, if a man is not anchored in Christ, why should he walk in the way of Christ? Why wouldn’t his every action ultimately come from greed and selfish ambition?\n\nPaul tells us there is a fundamental difference between Christians and the world. We are fully changed by Jesus, and therefore, we are measured by a different stick altogether. Everywhere you look, the world is going to cheat and deceive, but why not? If we do not know Christ and are not changed by Him, there is no reason not to cheat and steal if we can get away with it. But as Christians we claim the name of Christ, and He has changed our hearts. We have every reason to choose what is right, even when no one is looking. And not only do we have reason, we have a responsibility. \n\nIn 1 Corinthians 5, Paul takes on the topic of immorality with the Church, and he does not do so casually. Sin among members of the body of Christ affects the whole body of believers. “Don’t you know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough?” Paul asks, an undeniable urgency in his tone. Though he is not with them in person, Paul is “present in spirit,” and he demands his brothers and sisters act in a manner worthy of Christ’s sacrifice (v.5). He asks them to remember their new measuring stick: the gospel and grace of Jesus.\n\nSo what are we to do with those in the world who don’t know Jesus, and who continually and exuberantly choose what is evil? Paul addresses this, too, explaining that it is God and God alone who judges (1 Corinthians 5:13). \n\nIt’s such a relief that it’s not our job to busybody around and judge the world for doing exactly what the world is wont to do. God will judge. Instead of our judgment, God is calling us to give our energy and “not [tire] of doing good” (Galatians 6:9). We can share the gospel and we can do good, but there’s no need for us to hustle our judgment on the world—it’s not even our job.\n\nAnd what about our brothers and sisters in the faith who do wrong? According to Scripture, reconciliation is the goal. Listen to these fiercely kind words from Galatians:\n\nBrothers and sisters, if someone is overtaken in any wrongdoing, you who are spiritual, restore such a person with a gentle spirit, watching out for yourselves so that you also won’t be tempted. Carry one another’s burdens; in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.\n\n—Galatians 6:1-2\n\nLook out for each other! “As we have opportunity, let us work for the good of all, especially for those who belong to the household of faith” (v.10). Have zeal for doing what is right, restore your Christian brothers and sisters with patience, and do not grow weary in your work of doing good. The Lord transforms His children, and He makes them fit for the task.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 6:1-20, Matthew 18:15-20, Titus 3:4-7\n\nLast August, I started snapping photos of waiting rooms in doctors’ offices. In an attempt to manage my pre-medical exam nerves, I snapped the first picture in an empty, grey walk-in clinic during my lunch break. I assured myself that when I walked out of the room and closed the door, I’d look back at the picture on my phone and laugh at how silly my fear was.\n\nAlmost a year later, I’ve amassed quite a collection of waiting room images. I still have the strange spasm in my shoulder that causes pain and is now considered chronic, at least by those doctors. It keeps me up at night, and hurts most while doing the work I love and feel called to—namely, writing. This year has brought more questions than answers, leaving me insecure about my pain. In the end, I feel like my body is more a vessel of shame and weakness than a temple of praise.\n\nIn some ways, our bodies ache with sin and pain. Our muscles, memory, and metabolism may fail us. Our bodies betray us with limits, and we betray our bodies when we disregard those limits. All this brokenness is an ever-present reminder of Christ’s body broken for us, our sin, and our shame.\n\nThe apostle Paul tells us we’ve been washed, sanctified, and justified “in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God” (v.11). Therefore, because of Christ’s sacrificial death and resurrection for us, our bodies are no longer our own; they were bought with a price. “So glorify God with your body” (vv.19–20).\n\nPaul tell us to flee from sexual immorality, to not be mastered by anything, to avoid legal disputes with one another—all in an effort to glorify God. Without the context of Jesus, this can begin to sound like a legalistic to-do list. But as theologian Henri Nouwen says, “The church is not an institution forcing us to follow rules but a community inviting us to still our hunger and thirst at its table.” \n\nIn 1 Corinthians 6, we find ways to still our hunger and thirst (1 Corinthians 4:11), but when we try to do so without filling them up with heavenly things instead, our bodies still feel like empty vessels of shame. Jesus is the only one who can truly fill us up and sustain us. When we turn to Him, we’re reminded that it was His body that was broken, His blood that was shed, for us. \n\nTo glorify God with our bodies means to place physical trust in His plan to bring redemption to our brokenness. It means taking part in the groans of humanity and the painfulness of sin. It means remembering His promises to bring wholeness and healing now, even if we don’t know when it’s coming. \n\nAcknowledging our aches and limitations is at the heart of what it is to be a child of God. He is all that we will ever need to withstand our heartache, pain, and sin. In our weakness, His power is perfected, and He is glorified (2 Corinthians 12:9). \n\nWe are not our own. We are His glory vessels. Thanks be to Him.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Principles of Marriage",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 7:1-40, Genesis 2:24\n\nAlmost half of marriages end in divorce, and the average length of a marriage that ends in divorce is only eight years (according to 2014 US census data). Eight years! It’s shocking that we stand up and promise “‘til death do us part,” yet only half of us make it past eight years. Marriage is hard. And indeed, the skills necessary to simply get along long-term with other people, not just spouses, are really difficult to come by. When we concede that marriage doesn’t have to last, we also allow that friendships don’t need to last. When the going gets tough, it’s just so much easier to find new friends and start over. Except it’s not.\n\nOn paper, marriage is an unachievable task. Paul commands wives to submit to their husbands, and then he turns to the husbands and piles onto the first unbelievable task this astonishing humdinger: “Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church” (Ephesians 5:22-25). In one fell swoop, it seems Paul is making an open-and-shut case that marriage is just never going to work. He even follows this up by saying, essentially, marriage is too much for him, and he’s chosen to keep out of the fray; and if anyone else has the constitution for it, they should stay unmarried also (1 Corinthians 7:8).\n\nBut here’s the problem: not everyone has Paul’s self-control, and instead we, ahem, “burn with desire” (v. 9).  We fall in love, and that love leads us to make wildly extravagant promises to each other. We promise, in our best clothes, in front of all our aunts and uncles, to love and honor one another for the rest of our lives. These are the bravest, most ridiculous promises I’ve ever made.\n\nI want to write a book titled, ’Til Death Do Us Part, and Other Lies I Told While Wearing a White Ball Gown. Because even though I’ve been married for thirteen years, have I truly kept my wedding vows? Have you? Even before we’d driven off into the sunset, I had already broken my vows. My heart was full of love, but my soul was still inclined to offer my new husband far less than the love I’m called to give. But that’s really the whole point. And that is why marriage is a covenant. We make extravagant promises that we cannot keep, but God keeps His promises. He created marriage and designed it to last. \n\nGod has called us to live in peace (v. 15), and it’s His peace that makes it possible for us to do so. I can rely on Him. He keeps His promises. He is there in the ceremony, walking through the covenant just like He did in the Old Testament. He makes our covenants, and He keeps up both ends of the deal. May we look to Him to preserve our marriages, our friendships, and our families. He is the One who takes our brave words made on brave days and makes them come true.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 8:1-13, John 10:14, 2 Timothy 2:14-19\n\nI love the phrase “read the room.” I distinctly remember the first time it became a phrase our friend group started to use. We were hanging out, reacting to a situation that had not gone the way I’d hoped it would. Some folks in the room were making light-hearted remarks, and I started glowering at them. READ THE ROOM, I thought, not even bothering to veil my frustration. I was hurting, and they didn’t see it. The words might not have been directed at me, but I was intensely vulnerable. \n\nPaul is helping the Corinthians navigate a similar sort of tension in this passage. Someone has asked Paul a question: Is it okay for Christians to eat meat that has been previously sacrificed to pagan idols? In Corinth at the time, most meat available had been used as part of temple sacrifices. So Corinthian Christians were wondering if it was okay to eat that meat, whether they purchased it in a market or were dining with non-Christian friends. \n\nPaul’s answer is pretty straightforward. Basically, if you’re asking this question because you’re a Christian, then you know that idols are nothing, so it would be totally fine because “all things are from him, and we exist for him” (1 Corinthians 8:6). But it’s not really about you, Paul explains. “Not everyone has this knowledge,” he says, so “be careful that this right of yours in no way becomes a stumbling block for the weak” (vv. 7,9). The warning Paul gives here isn’t about eating meat; it’s about how knowledge leads to pride and a feeling of superiority over weaker brothers and sisters in Christ. It’s about reading the room. \n\nFor some new Christians, eating meat that had been sacrificed to an idol would have been difficult. Paul says it could “wound their weak conscience,” which is a sin against Christ (v.12). If Christians who were still a bit unsteady in their faith saw more mature Christians eating sacrificed meat, it could cause confusion. Those who had been tempted to pray to pagan idols in the past might be tempted to see the meat as something more than it was, while to more mature, discerning eyes, it was just meat. \n\nPaul gives the Corinthians, and us, a basic template for answering this and similar questions: put others first. Let your conscience be guided by whatever is best for your brother or sister in Christ. Throughout 1 Corinthians, Paul makes this point that we are to act in love, care for others, and live in the freedom of Christ that allows us to put others first. \n\n“Read the room” is a sarcastic, modern phrase that reminds us that there are others present. Paul is much more winsome, but no less pointed, in reminding more mature Christians that there are new believers watching, learning from them. This reminder is poignant for me as well. I’m often tempted to be sarcastic, to push the boundaries of humor, or cross other lines that might be confusing for non-believers or new Christians.\n\nBut putting my witness to Christ first and caring for those around me requires that I live differently. It requires that I always read the room, and know that how I act, speak, and treat others reflects my identity in Jesus. Paul says that if meat were to cause a brother to stumble, he would never eat meat again. I pray for that sense of discernment in my own life. I long for a careful, caring heart like Paul’s and, even more so, for a heart like Christ’s.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 9:1-27, Matthew 15:11, Romans 15:17-19\n\nI was a gangly eighth grader with the athleticism of an opossum. As one does in middle school, I signed up for the track team strictly because my friends had done the same. There was not a cell in my hormonal body that wanted to run the four-lap race assigned to me. I lumbered to the starting line hauling a bundle of nerves and a posture of defeat. \n\nThen… Bang! The starting pistol fired, and we began circling the track. As I crested the final turn of my third lap, I noticed a few frontrunners were crossing the finish line a full lap ahead of me. Hungry for glory, I sealed my fate in the Track Hall of Shame. I squared my shoulders and crossed the finish line in style, confident no one would notice I still had a lap left to run. \n\nAssuming I’d successfully cheated my way onto the winners’ platform, I celebrated my victory. It was a brief moment of glory followed by a humiliating spectacle of defeat. As the last of the runners crossed the finish line, I felt a tap on my shoulder. \n\n“You,” said a man with a stopwatch in his hand. “Run your last lap.” I ran the final lap of the race on an empty track. It was the opposite of a victory lap. \n\nSuch is the image Paul paints for us. As disciples and disciple makers, we are runners on the track of faith. God’s truth is a baton that has been passed from Abraham to Isaac, to the apostles, to Paul, to us. We are pushing toward the prize of making Christ known. Yet, it’s easy to forget what we’re doing here. We’re so often distracted by the crowd in the stands or the other runners pumping and huffing beside us. Paul reminds us that those sideways glances can cost us the victory. \n\n“Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified” (vv. 24-27). \n\nThe apostle isn’t writing about salvation here. No amount of training or self-discipline could earn us that. Salvation is ours forever because of Christ’s work, not ours. But, let’s be honest; it’s possible to be saved, but not sowing. To be redeemed, but not reaping. To be an ambassador of faith, but not a good one. It’s possible to run the race of faith, but not run it well. \n\nPaul’s obsession with the gospel (vv. 15–18) is what glued his eyeballs to the finish line. He could face criticism, hardship, and scarcity, and still keep running because allegiance to the gospel was the medal he imagined hanging around his neck. \n\nSince we don’t want to cross the finish line with heads hanging in defeat, how do we keep our own eyes on the prize? Like a runners cadence, we repeat. . . \n\nIt’s about the gospel.\n\nIt’s about the gospel.\n\nIt’s about the gospel.\n\nLet us keep running!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Wynter Pitts\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 10:1-11:1, Exodus 13:17-22, Philippians 2:1-2\n\nWhen I was a little girl, I loved doll babies. I’m sure I’m not alone here, but I will admit that my affection for the plastic figures may have been a little extreme. I didn’t have any sisters, and my one and only brother is six years older than me. So in a lot of ways, my dolls were my friends. I’d spend hours dressing them, teaching them, taking them for walks. I sat them in circles for storytime, and made sure they were “fed” before bedtime. They were special to me, and although I had way more than I needed, I still longed for the latest, prettiest, most updated versions available. And I never wanted to share any of them, with anyone. \n\nI remember one particular day at my grandparents’ house, a new friend was visiting. As usual, I was busy playing with the set of babies my grandparents purchased just for their house. I was doing what brought me joy, and it never occurred to me to share. Before long, my grandfather casually said, “Wynter, which doll can your friend play with?” Unsurprisingly, I refused to part with any. \n\nIt’s easy to think back on this story and see my actions for exactly what they were: selfish. My loving grandfather would have been completely justified in taking each of my dolls from me. After all, my actions had proven me to be undeserving. But in his love for me and his desire to see my heart changed, he did not take my dolls. Instead he pulled me close and explained how my lack of care for another person had not only hurt someone else, but had also disappointed him.\n\nWhen our Heavenly Father notices our selfishness, He gently reminds us of what real love actually looks like. In 1 Corinthians 10, the apostle Paul says, “No one is to seek his own good, but the good of the other person” (v. 24). We have all been blessed by God’s matchless goodness. Jesus didn’t just give up a part of what He had every right to hold onto. Instead, He gave it all, His very life. \n\nJesus’ choice to pursue goodness for everyone is the ultimate measure of seeking goodness for another. May we imitate His love because He first loved us.\n\nIf then there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any affection and mercy, make my joy complete by thinking the same way, having the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.\n\n—Philippians 2:1-2\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 11:2-34, Matthew 26:26-28, Romans 3:25-26\n\nIn an early episode of I Love Lucy, Lucy is pregnant, distracted, and she hasn’t fixed Ricky dinner. The poor man is irritated, miserable, and hungry. He declares his need for steak and potatoes, but with time running short, Lucy counters with a fried egg sandwich—and he scoffs at this paltry offering. At this point, my husband and I had to stop the episode and look at each other: “He literally can’t make food for himself? She’s had a busy day and he won’t accept a simpler meal?” The difference between the dinner expectations of 1952 television husbands and 2018 television husbands are surprisingly different.\n\nThe cultural expectations for the roles of men and women have changed even more dramatically since Paul wrote this letter to the Corinthians. Paul’s instructions about head coverings and spheres of authority make us a little uncomfortable. But head coverings for women were pretty normal, even as recently as 100 years ago. Just because our husbands can make their own dinner and we wear our hair in loose, glorious ringlets, doesn’t mean we’re getting it exactly right. It just means we happen to be the generation walking around right now. It doesn’t make us smarter or better equipped to appreciate authority than generations past.\n\nWho should be making dinner? And who’s hair should be blowing in the breeze? It’s tempting for us to get caught up here in these little brambly questions but miss the important issue here of authority. Who is our authority? First, you know what my answer will be: Christ is the Lord of creation, the Lord of men, women, communities, families. All authority has been given to Him on heaven and on earth. So, if you had any adorable delusions whether the ultimate authority is your own self, or the president, or your two-year-old, put them to rest. There is one final authority.\n\nThis same Lord of all, the ultimate authority, yielded up all on our behalf, giving His very body and blood to rescue us from just condemnation.\n\n“On the night when He was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread, and when He had given thanks, broke it, and said, ‘This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.’\n\nIn the same way also He took the cup, after supper, and said, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.’ For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes” (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).\n\nThe question of authority comes down to yielding our own will to the will of someone else. When we eat and drink “in remembrance of” Him, do we truly yield our all to Him? Do we remember the glory He laid aside for us, or do we seek our own glory? When we hold back in order to honor ourselves—seeking our own will, based on our own understanding—the result is the same as it was in Corinth: divisions arise, each man seeks his own gain, and some fall to excess, while others are neglected.\n\nHe served us dinner and washed our feet, without hesitation and without reservation. And for the meal before Him, which signaled His own agonizing death, He gave thanks. Our hearts ought to be full of thanksgiving in turn, full of a desire to serve and honor others. When we see the world as Christ’s, we can make the dinner, we can love our neighbor, we can honor our husbands, we can yield to God’s will for us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 12:1-31, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Thessalonians 5:19-21\n\nMusic and theater were a big part of my upbringing. My sisters and I were not the most athletic kids, so choir, voice lessons, and musicals were our sport. I was never really content with just being a member of the choir, or a background part in a musical. I always wanted the solo or the lead.\n\nPerhaps there was a church member or two in Corinth who felt the same way. Maybe they were trying to steal the show, or maybe they were trying to prove their gifts were better than someone else’s. Paul enters and tells them that as believers, we operate as one unit, not solo performers. We are all members of one body, and “the body is not one part but many” (1 Corinthians 12:14).\n\nEven though I said goodbye to my music and theater days long ago, I still struggle with this truth. I still want to stand out. I still want the “best” gifts. I still crave that recognition. (My family didn’t nickname me “Drama Mama” for nothing.) But if we look at what I Corinthians 12 really says about our gifts, we see that it has little to do with our individual talents, and much more to do with the way they unify us as believers.\n\nThe variation of gifts in Christian community highlights our need for one another. Where I am weak, another member of the body is strong. Where someone else is weak, I am strong. Individually, we can only go so far with our own gifts. Together, we are a full cast, the complete body of Christ. This makes us able to serve our community, one another, and in turn, bring glory to God. Our gifts serve a greater purpose: unification.\n\nAs Paul explained, “Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit. There are different ministries, but the same Lord. And there are different activities, but the same God activates each gift in each person” (vv. 4-6). The emphasis here is on what’s the same about us, not what’s different. We all have the same Spirit. We all have the same Lord. We all have the same Father.\n\nThe Church is at its best when we operate as one unit, not as talented individuals trying to outshine each other. When we operate as a unit, we reflect Christ,  “[f]or as the body is one and has many parts… so also is Christ” (v.12).\n\nIn spite of my desire for the spotlight, I am learning that the Christian life is not always a loud one. What we do in love and service to our Lord may not always have an audience. So much of this journey is spent using our gifts in quiet ways that may not bring us individual attention, but will bring balance and unity to the body—this is how our gifts were intended to serve.\n\nMay we stop running after the spotlight and find contentment working backstage. May we seek unity above our own glory, and may we be grateful for diversity in the body and all the gifts of the Spirit bestowed on us by the Father.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 13:1-13, Ezekiel 20:35, Galatians 5:5-26\n\nLove, as framed in 1 Corinthians 13, was framed for me as a child of six. It was a perfect square made of 15 smaller squares, each cross-stitched in pastel blues and pinks and yellows. I stared at it for hours of my childhood because it sat above the baby grand piano at which I endured years of piano lessons. \n\nEvery week I would stare at those squares in the dim light of my piano teacher’s studio and count with the metronome until I could leave. It’s no wonder she told my parents I was a hopeless case and to put me in soccer or horseback riding when, after four years of lessons, I was still incapable of playing the most rudimentary scales. I wasn’t listening to a word she said. But I still remember the cross-stitched squares perfectly today. \n\nI don’t know about you, but love is hard for me. Love as a noun is okay. It’s very ethereal and nebulous and conjures up good feelings, emotions. “Love is love,” is what the cool kids are all saying. Okay, well… yes, but milk is milk and books are books and, of course, a thing is what it is. But what does that mean? Love as a noun is something, yes, but love is so much more than the smell of a newborn, or the flutters of a new relationship, or the feeling you have toward street tacos or 230-calories-per-serving ice cream or getting the thing you want. Love is so much more and so much harder than those things. It often feels more like a tone-deaf person practicing scales than it does anything sweet or nice or pastel.\n\nIf I’m honest, real love (the kind Paul writes about in this chapter) sounds like a symphony I’m never going to be able to play. It sounds beautiful and hopeless at the same time. I am never going to be capable of being perfectly patient, perfectly kind, perfectly without envy or boasting. I can barely bear some things, but how could I possibly bear all things? If what Paul is talking about is the definition of love, I’ve been practicing for a long time, and I need to find another hobby.  \n\nThe comfort of this chapter, for the ones who are as hopeless about love as I am, is further down: “Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known” (v. 12, emphasis mine).\n\nThe harmony of these two sections clue us in to the true meaning of this text: just as my knowledge is partial, my love is partial. But just as I am fully known, I am fully loved. By whom? By the only One whose love is perfect. By the only One whose love is perfectly patient, perfectly kind, perfectly able to bear all things, believe all things, hope all things, and endure all things. There is only One who has endured all things, and this is Christ. \n\nPractice will not make my love perfect or even easy in this Christian life, no matter how hard we run our scales. Discipline is good and sanctification is sure; kindness will come more easily, patience more freely, but still imperfectly. But Paul assures us our dim sight won’t last forever and the scales will someday fall. Even still, “these three remain: faith, hope, and love” (v. 13). One day we will see fully and be seen fully by the greatest of all these—Love Himself, Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 14:1-39, Exodus 25:8, 1 John 4:1-3\n\nIn a few short weeks, my husband and I will board a plane to China to bring home our son. We’ve never met in person. He’s seen photos of us, and he knows to call us “Mama” and “Baba.” But he doesn’t know us, not really, nor do we know him. Yet God has tethered our hearts to one another in a way I think I may not fully understand this side of eternity. God has made us a family even now, before we’ve met, and that is a fact that overshadows all others. \n\nI’m nervous about bringing our boy home. I’m excited, overjoyed, in tears with anticipation; but the unknowns that lie ahead make my chest tighten. I have to remind myself to practice what I learned when waiting for our first three children to arrive: Breathe. Just breathe. \n\nI wonder how he’ll adjust to his new home, to his big sister and big brothers, to his two big dogs and the cat and the chickens in the backyard. I wonder how he’ll take to American culture and American food. But lately, I’m most nervous about the language. He speaks Mandarin; we speak English. Will we be able to communicate? Will he understand our botched renditions of “I love you” and “You are our son” and “It’s okay” in his native tongue? \n\nHow and what we communicate to our son matters. Everything we say, from playful banter to earnest conversation, should flow from our love and desire to care for him. Our words are rooted in the fact that we are family. \n\nWhen Paul addresses the gifts of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 14, specifically the gifts of prophesying and speaking in tongues, he says some things that are tough for our modern ears to understand. But if we look at the chapter as a whole, we can see a theme emerge: “Seek to excel in building up the church” (v. 12). In this lengthy chapter, Paul acknowledges that the Holy Spirit is real, that the Spirit indeed gives gifts that can only come from God, and that these gifts are good and God-honoring. But in the same breath, he offers a warning about how these gifts are to be used—and, as importantly, why they are to be used. According to Paul, the reason is more straightforward than we might expect: “Everything is to be done for building up” (v. 26). \n\nThe Church, the body of believers, is God’s dwelling place on earth. Just as God’s presence filled the tabernacle in the Old Testament, His Spirit fills those who have put our faith in Jesus. The way we conduct our worship and our gatherings matter because God is in our midst, and “God is not a God of disorder but of peace” (v. 33). Furthermore, our interactions and our meeting together ought to be governed by unity, not discord. We are a family—a family established by God Himself. Our words and actions are rooted in this eternal truth. \n\nThe diversity within the family of God is a beautiful, purposeful thing. May the Holy Spirit that binds us make our hearts tender toward our fellow family members, seeking to love the Church and build her up in all we say and do. May we worship in a way that causes the unbelievers in our midst to proclaim, “God is really among you.” \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Essential Resurrection",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 15:1-19, Ephesians 2:4-7, Hebrews 2:5-9\n\nI thought I was going to be a lawyer when I grew up. I wanted to be a doctor for the longest time, but once I got to high school and realized science was not my strong suit, those dreams flew swiftly out the window. Being a lawyer was the next best option; I enjoyed reading and writing, and history was my best subject. And, as my parents would tell you without hesitation, I could pick an argument with anyone over anything, and I usually won. I presented many cases to my parents over the years, from bedroom renovations to puppies, and everything in between.\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 15, Paul is making a case for the resurrection of the dead. Paul accuses some of the Corinthians of saying there is no resurrection of the dead: that is, once Christians die, they will not be raised with Christ. Paul then argues that if they believe in the resurrection of Christ, then they must also believe in the resurrection of the dead. Paul’s argument is not to prove that Christians will be raised in resurrection with Christ, but to say that the people who deny the resurrection of the dead are wrong. His argument forces the Corinthians to come to the realization that there is, in fact, hope for the future resurrection of those who believe in Christ.\n\nPaul’s argument to the Corinthians is fit for a trial court. He’s making them decide whether or not they actually believe what they say they do. Paul reminds the Corinthians that “Christ died for our sins… that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15:3-4). Paul challenges the Corinthian church to remember what they say they believe, because if those things are not true, then all of their proclamations are in vain.\n\nThis passage is one that is read often at funerals and memorial services of loved ones who have passed away. It’s comforting to think about the resurrection in the face of death. It grounds us, reminds us of who we are and where our true home lies.\n\nToday, let this passage remind you of the power and might of a God who sent His Son to die for us, and raised Him on the third day so that we, too, might live with Him in eternal resurrection. We should put our faith and our hope in this God, the God who “raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavens” (Ephesians 2:6). Our citizenship does not belong here on earth, but to the new heavens and new earth that come with the resurrection. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Victorious Resurrection",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 15:20-58, Philippians 1:12, 1 Thessalonians 4:17\n\nTexans are obsessed with our state flower, the bluebonnet. Bluebonnets are wildflowers that bloom in early spring. For several weeks each season, they line our interstates and take over our fields. They are a sudden flower, nowhere to be seen for months and months and then, suddenly, they are everywhere. They don’t space out their arrival. It feels like they decide to bloom all at once. And overnight, Texas is a sea of blue.\n\nThis is why I was surprised to learn that if you want to plant bluebonnets to bloom in the spring, experts suggest planting the seeds in late summer or early fall. Though it looks like the wildflowers appear overnight, they are actually growing beneath the soil for months.\n\nI thought of the bluebonnets while reading Paul’s words in 1 Corinthians 15, when he compares our resurrection to seeds being sown: “So it is with the resurrection of the dead: Sown in corruption, raised in incorruption; sown in dishonor, raised in glory; sown in weakness, raised in power; sown a natural body, raised a spiritual body” (vv. 42-44). In the resurrection, we will be completely transformed, and Paul says this change will happen suddenly, “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye” (vv. 51–52).  \n\nMy temptation when reading these words is to look forward to the change to come, and ignore my need to change now. Great, I think, in the end when I am resurrected, all will be well. I will be the person I was made to be. I, and the entire world, will be restored and redeemed.\n\nBut the last verse of this chapter suggests another way to think about this sudden change. Paul says, “Therefore, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the Lord’s work, knowing that your labor in the Lord is not in vain” (v.58).\n\nThe instruction isn’t, “Therefore, sit back and relax, it’ll all be okay in the end.” The instruction is, “Therefore keep working, steadfastly, immovably, excelling at the Lord’s work because none of this is in vain.” The change to come will seem sudden, but really, just as the bluebonnet is sown in fall to bloom in spring, we will have been working toward change all along.\n\nThis is incredibly convicting for me. This is incredibly convicting for the church. We have been sown, and now we must do the hard work of growing. This is the Lord’s work: we care for the poor. We work toward reconciliation. We confess. We repent. We forgive. And we do all of this now because we know it is not in vain. What the Lord plants, He will grow. The work He begins, He will complete (Philippians 1:6).\n\nSo today, may we look toward our final resurrection, made possible through the resurrection of Christ, with great hope. But let’s not allow our hope for the future to distract us from the work at hand. There is much to do. Therefore, let’s be steadfast, immovable, and excel at the Lord’s work on earth, knowing we may not see all the fruit of our labor now, but all will be in bloom when the trumpet sounds.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Lord’s Work",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 16:1-21, Leviticus 23:15-22, Deuteronomy 31:6-8\n\nAlmost everybody works in some way. Whether we’re raising kids, conducting high-powered business meetings, teaching in a classroom, or polishing nails at the local salon, most folks know what it’s like to have a job. You know what’s frustrating, though? Doing a ton of work, but having no idea what’s expected of you. This is what the apostle Paul is trying to avoid in his letters to the Corinthian church. \n\nThe Corinthian church was multicultural, multiethnic, and socioeconomically diverse. It seems the only thing everyone in this group of folks had in common was their decision to follow Jesus. I’m guessing the members of this community had their work cut out for them! Not only were they charged with the tasks of being the salt of the earth and the light of the world, but they also had to figure out how to live and work together in order to present themselves to Christ and to the world as a unified body—not an easy undertaking.\n\nPaul is aware of this, and so, in a way, the book of 1 Corinthians serves as a job description for the early Church. The apostle makes clear what is expected of the community of believers who bear the name of Jesus Christ, and in the very last chapter, he closes with highlighting three growth areas for the Corinthian church. \n\nGenerosity. Paul is encouraging this church to share liberally from their financial resources to support the church in Jerusalem, which was experiencing difficult times. Note this: he didn’t ask the Corinthian church as an institution to support the Jerusalem church, but instead asked each person to set aside a portion of their income for the cause, every week. And if you earned a higher income, you were expected to give more.\n\nHumility. Paul acknowledges four leaders who should be honored because of their work in the Lord. For Paul, honor and submission go hand in hand; you honor others by submitting your will to theirs. \n\nLove. Paul commands, “Do everything in love” (v. 14). The motive for every word and every action should be love. It’s love that compels Paul to labor for the sake of the gospel, and it’s love that prompted him to write this letter to the Corinthian church in the first place.\n\nGenerosity, humility, and love. What do these three have in common? They are major attributes of Jesus Christ, the common denominator in the Church. Jesus was generous to humankind, becoming poor so that we could become rich. He humbled Himself by obeying the Father, even to the point of death. Jesus’ love was so great that He laid down His life for those who were His enemies. \n\nThis is good news for us! Just like the Corinthians, working as a unified Church is tough. But thanks be to God that we’ve got clear expectations lined out for us in God’s Word. And not only that—we have a perfect example in Jesus Christ, who sent the Holy Spirit to empower us to be the people God has called us to be.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 1:1-24, 2 Corinthians 2:1-4, Isaiah 40:1-2, Romans 5:8-10 \n\nOf all the people excited about my parents moving into a new house, I wasn’t one of them. Although I live in an entirely different state, hours away, I was under the impression that my mom and dad would live in the house I grew up in for the rest of their lives, tending to my childhood belongings and keeping our memories safe. But ultimately, that wasn’t the best plan for them, and while I understood that, I didn’t want to accept it.\n\nAll I could think about was how their new house wouldn’t have the staircase I’d walked down while wearing my high school prom dress, the room where my brother learned to play the trumpet, or the end of the driveway where the school bus used to wait for us. It wouldn’t have a hidden nail polish stain on the bedroom carpet, or our cat’s favorite spots to lie in the sun. It wouldn’t have neighbors who stopped by on birthdays or just because, and it certainly wouldn’t have an address already known by heart.\n\nAnd yet, after the moving trucks had gone and the boxes had been unpacked, I visited my parents’ new house and was surprised to find it less empty than I’d imagined. Inside, I was greeted by a hallway of family photographs, the scent of my favorite brownies wafting through the air from the kitchen, and the cat snuggled up and basking in the sunlight. Sometimes, comfort comes with us. God’s presence always does, that’s for sure.\n\nMany times, it’s easy to forget that we don’t face suffering alone the way Christ did. Because of His sacrifice, we get pain and comfort in equal proportion, not one without the other. “For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so also through Christ our comfort overflows” (2 Corinthians 1:5).\n\nSuffering may bring us to new places we’d never choose to go, but God’s comfort promises to follow. It may not take away all the pain or change the situation entirely, but it does something even more significant: it reveals to us God’s heart for His people, His love for us. He didn’t want us to know the wrath of pain without knowing the eternal promise of its relief. Comfort reminds us of the end game of eternity. It acknowledges God’s power and ultimate plan to set things right again.\n\nMay God’s comfort be the thing to rearrange our afflictions and lift us to joy. May the promises of His tenderness meet us in our griefs and sorrows, disappointments and not-yets. May the kindness of His character find us and make even darkness an occasion to seek light. And may we feel at home and at rest in His comforting presence. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Sinner Forgiven",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 2:5-17, Matthew 6:14-15, Colossians 3:12-17\n\nFor weeks, I have grappled with these passages in 2 Corinthians. Forgiveness is such a complicated, messy, and integral part of the Christian faith. And if I’m honest, I don’t know if I understand how it works, or whether I’m practicing it well in my life. \n\nWhen I really let myself think about forgiveness, it touches raw nerves. It calls up painful memories of the times I’ve been hurt, and the times I’ve done the hurting. And that doesn’t feel good. In fact, I’d rather just forget about those parts of my life and move on. \n\nBut contrary to popular belief, Jesus does not call us to “forgive and forget.” Christian forgiveness does not require rose-colored glasses or some “spiritual” version of denial. What it does require is faith that if Jesus has carried the weight of our sin, He can also carry the weight of our wounds.\n\nGod doesn’t minimize our offenses. He doesn’t wave them away with a magic wand of denial. Nor does He offer empty cop-outs. Instead, He enacted an eternal, and costly, plan to set things right. \n\nThe God-man of great sorrow, Jesus, was well acquainted with the evil of this world (Isaiah 53:3), and He refused to ignore it. Instead, He chose to bear the debt on His own back. Knowing that God could not be in the presence of unholy people, Jesus put on our unholiness and gave us His perfect record in return. The sin was heavy, and Jesus carried it, though He didn’t resent us while carrying the cross. He didn’t wait for us to ask Him to do it, either. He forgave us before we even knew we needed forgiveness—because He loved us first. \n\nAs impossible as it sometimes feels, we are called to emulate Christ. “For to God we are the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing” (2 Corinthians 2:15). Still, forgiveness is not easy. It does not eliminate pain. Forgiveness is an active, voluntary choice to carry the weight of someone else’s sin. It does not guarantee that we will be reconciled to that person, nor that the relationship will ever be the same. Forgiveness says, “You no longer have to make up for what you did to me. I will carry the cost.”\n\nBut I’m not Jesus. So even my ability to forgive is imperfect. One of Jesus’ disciples once asked whether it was fair to forgive someone seven times, and Jesus replied,\n\n“I tell you, not as many as seven… but seventy times seven” (Matthew 18:22).\n\nI don’t believe that is a call to be abused over and over again by the same person. In my life, that has meant actively forgiving someone for the same crime, even as I find myself feeling resentful again. When the bitterness returns, I can choose to let that old wound fester, or I can put on the salve of forgiveness. There may still be a scar, but I am no longer keeping the wound open in order to prove how much I’ve been hurt. \n\nWhen forgiveness is hard, faith reminds me to focus less on what someone did to me, and more on what Jesus did for me. It is in that posture of humility that I can bring my wounds and my sins back to the feet of Jesus. It is there that He reminds me that even when my suffering feels heavy, He is the one who ultimately carries it all.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 3:1-18, Jeremiah 31:31-34, 1 John 3:2\n\nAs someone whose greatest love language is words of affirmation, handwritten letters are a huge deal to me. My mom put a note in my lunchbox every day when I was growing up. My friends and family wrote letters to me before I left to study abroad for a semester. And my best friend knows that the quickest way to brighten my day is a quick note delivered with a fresh cup of coffee. I keep a box of letters from loved ones on my desk to read when I’m having a hard day. They have brought me encouragement in my darkest moments, reminding me that I am loved and cherished.\n\nIn the days of the early Church, letters served an even greater purpose than they do now. Letters functioned similarly to recommendation letters written for employment or educational purposes; they were vouchers for people when they entered into new churches and new communities. \n\nWhen I was applying for graduate school last spring, I toiled over choosing the professors and mentors who I would ask to write my recommendation letters. I wanted to make sure they had the best impression of me. I wanted to be confident I was worthy of their recommendation, that the letters they sent to admissions offices would include the best version of me I could present. And so I sent those professors my most stacked resume and the best version of my application essays. In short, I wanted to prove I was good enough—both to the people writing my recommendation letters, and to the people who would read them.\n\nWhen Paul tells the Corinthians that they are Christ’s living letters, he’s reminding them of their identity as the people of God. He’s reminding them of who they are, of their identity as the body of Christ. He’s reminding them that the Spirit of God has written the law of love on their hearts, doing away with the old covenant and making way for a brand new one: the covenant they can be part of because of Christ Jesus. Our recommendations and our accolades don’t hold any weight in the new covenant because “our adequacy is from God” (2 Corinthians 3:5). Our worth and our confidence are in Christ Jesus—not in ourselves, nor in the things that are praised by others.\n\nWe, too, are able to be a part of this new covenant—the covenant that replaced the law of Moses and gave us the ability to act in boldness. This covenant gives us life, hope, and freedom.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 4:1-18, Romans 6:5-7, 2 Timothy 4:3\n\nMy husband and I have a saying in our home, “Fidelity (or faithfulness) to the Word of God and not to an outcome.” We say it to one another and to others often, because the truth is we are often more interested in controlling the outcome of a situation than we are in abiding by the Word of God. \n\nWe want success.\n\nWe want freedom.\n\nWe want peace.\n\nWe want “the scoop.”\n\nWe want to be seen rightly.\n\nWe want to defend our actions.\n\nWe want time to ourselves.\n\nWe don’t want to confront sin.\n\nWe don’t want to do hard things.\n\nWe don’t want to be held responsible.\n\nHow then, we usually find ourselves asking, can we get the desired outcome out of any situation? \n\nI don’t think we’re alone in this. It’s human nature to spin the story, cast blame, make excuses. From the beginning of time, cunning words have been practiced and God’s words have been tampered with (Genesis 3). All it takes is a cursory glance around at the state of the Church, the government, family, and my own heart to see the practice of cunning words abounding and God’s Word still being tampered with. We are all playing chess with people, circumstances, God’s Word, and His timing—trying to get the outcome we desire or avoid the outcome we don’t want. \n\nWithin today’s passage, this is what strikes me most about Paul’s words to the Corinthians: “For we are not proclaiming ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for [Jesus’] sake” (2 Corinthians 4:5). The main thing we’re doing when we try to control the outcome, hide the truth, and circumvent the hard things, is proclaim our own glory and significance. We’re trying to make ourselves look good, look right (or at least less wrong). We’re trying to raise ourselves in the estimation of others. \n\nBut look again at what Paul tells the Corinthians: “God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of the darkness,’ has shown in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus” (v. 6). This is a powerful picture, if we pay attention. \n\nGod’s glory (Christ Jesus) shines into our hearts (darkened by sin and brokenness), giving us the light of knowledge. As we’re tying ourselves into knots trying to control the narrative and the outcome, God is shining the light of Jesus into our dark hearts and giving us knowledge, the very thing we lack. (For if we had it, there would be no need to feel anxious about outcomes, because we’d always make the perfect decision.) And what knowledge is this? Look back to the beginning of the chapter: \n\n“Therefore, since we have this ministry because we were shown mercy, we do not give up. Instead, we have renounced secret and shameful things, not acting deceitfully or distorting the word of God, but commending ourselves before God to everyone’s conscience by an open display of the truth” (vv. 1–2). \n\nDo you want to walk in all of life with a good outcome? Do you want to be above reproach? A worshiper of the one true God? A humble, faithful, kind, gentle person? Let the light of Christ Jesus shine on your darkened heart, the one more prone to seeking out its own way than making way for God. And, having walked faithfully and according to God’s Word, let others see the outcomes in your life as they truly are—as someone holding fast to God’s truth, not their own, whose heart is alight with Christ Jesus—even if the outcomes of your life look foolish to the world. Your fidelity is to His Word and His will first.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 5:1-6:2, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Titus 2:11-14\n\nLast summer, we ventured out west where we spent about a week sleeping in a tent with our five children. Driving from Washington back home to Tennessee, we passed the base of Mt. Rainer, the Grand Tetons, and other increasingly brave and out-of-the-way places. As we were driving through the Yakima Valley one evening, we realized it was late and getting dark, and we hadn’t settled on a place to set up camp for the night. And so we stopped along the Naches River on an abandoned stretch of highway with tall hills on both sides of the camp.\n\nBy this point we had a travel system in place; everyone knew their job, so we all worked together quickly to set up our tent. Once we’d settled in, we realized we were not alone. Just a stone’s throw away, tucked behind the sagebrush, cooking hot dogs over a fire, was Frank. I helped the kids play/bathe in the river and helped them to some supper, while my husband, Caleb, introduced himself. Frank lived in his tent full-time and had a lot of really good ideas for long-term, electricity-free refrigeration. We exchanged kindnesses and small gifts, and fell asleep in our respective tents. For us, that night was the bravest, most rugged camping we’d ever logged. But for Frank, it was just a Tuesday. \n\nI love the hope that Paul gives us in this passage from 2 Corinthians, because no matter how comfortable or uncomfortable we are in our earthly tents, they will all be packed up and folded away someday. Because of Jesus, this is not our home. The Father “made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:21).\n\nPaul acknowledges that we are groaning in our earthly bodies, some of us living with pain that won’t go away until Jesus comes. Some of us carrying a weight of sadness that makes us long to go home. No matter what kind of tent we are living in, it will be destroyed.\n\nThe thought of my own death fills me with concern for my children. But setting that hefty thought aside and clinging to the truth Paul is teaching in this passage, I see that our earthly death means the ending of a short, uncomfortable camping trip, and the joy and relief of finally going home—where things are clean and warm and beautiful, and there’s good food and good company. But we have never seen it. So we hold on to our tents, even though they are fraying and growing holes and starting to let the rain in. These tents are awesome, don’t get me wrong. But they are not the final stop. In the meantime, Paul says, we sit in our tents and we groan.\n\nBut Paul exhorts us, “So we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord” (2 Corinthians 5:6). While we are still here on earth in these awesome and leaky bodies, biding our time, we have the mighty hope of our future eternal home with Christ. During these camping days, we aim to be pleasing to Him and long for the day when He will finally bring us home.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 6:3-7:1, Ezekiel 37:26-28, Philippians 2:12-13\n\nSalt and light, stewards and servants—these are among the descriptors used to define the people of God. Like so much about faith, they feel like square pegs that refuse to be shoved into the round holes of the world’s expectations. \n\nAnd yet, these are more than pretty platitudes. Church, this is who we are. This is how God’s Word calls us to live. Having our paradigm for identity and success shifted so radically by the gospel can feel disorienting. There’s a temptation to use all the wrong litmus tests to gauge if we’re getting it right. In our homes and our churches, our culture and our community, how can we know if we’re building a ministry without fault? If success cannot be measured in accolades and “Atta girls!”, what rewards are given to faithful servants? These questions make me grateful that Paul provides us with a new set of gold stars to aspire to from today’s reading in 2 Corinthians 6. And they are: great endurance, purity, truthful speech, and the power of God (vv. 4, 6-7).\n\nPaul identified these as hallmarks of a ministry no one could fault (v. 3). He surely knew a thing or two about measuring ministry successes all wrong. His former colleagues in the religious elite considered his ministry a heresy. His fellow Christ-followers often questioned his methodology. Even his co-laborers questioned his decision-making on occasion. Yet, we find in Paul a minister unmoved. Though still sinful, Paul was steadfast. Paul knew why he ministered (to spread the gospel), and he knew how to measure his success. This, friends, is liberation. \n\nWe, too, are free to stop measuring our success as Christian parents by how our children behave in any given moment. We are free to stop considering the wishes and whims of culture as an indicator of the Church’s effectiveness. We are empowered to use our gifts to share the gospel and build up the body of Christ without fretting if no one seems to notice. We are set free from the doubt that inevitably comes when we worry God has our ministry under a microscope. \n\nSince none of this can be measured by human standards, we are free to throw out the measuring stick altogether. When we look to God alone to reward our faithful service, we find that He is the true reward. “For it is God who is working in you both to will and to work according to his good purpose” (Philippians 2:13). \n\nThe invitation Christ extended from the cross must bleed over into our concept of successful ministry. Christ does all the heavy-lifting, and thus He deserves every iota of glory. Our job is so simple in return. We keep serving, never tiring of doing good. We keep clinging to God’s Word, refusing to let other voices pollute the truth we know. We keep telling the truth, again and again and again. We keep bragging on our weaknesses, confident in how they bend the spotlight away from us and toward the indisputable power of God. \n\nSuccessful ministry rarely looks like we think it should. Paul reminds us that this, too, is grace.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 7:2-16, Lamentations 3:19-24, Acts 3:19-20\n\nHave you ever been confronted by somebody when you knew you were in the wrong? As a counselor, there have been many times when I’ve witnessed a spouse calling out their partner for some glaring, painful sin. When this happens, I’ve consistently seen one of two reactions take place: ownership or defensiveness. It’s hard to hear the truth about ourselves. To not only stare our failure in the face, but also have somebody else observe it too, can feel shameful. \n\nWhether we respond with ownership or defensiveness is a matter of the heart. Of course, all of this is presuming the confrontation takes place in a godly manner. I’m not talking about unhealthy conflict or persecution that is neither godly nor loving. But when our flaws are confronted or even rebuked in love, as Paul did with the Corinthians, how we respond shows what we believe about the gospel. Are we going to allow the Spirit to convict our hearts, or are we going to cover our ears and point the blame elsewhere?\n\nWhile it’s scary to admit we don’t have it all together, when we do acknowledge our sin we can turn toward Jesus in repentance and know we are forgiven. When our sin saddens us, we experience “godly grief,” which “produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, but worldly grief produces death” (2 Corinthian 7:10). \n\nThis is a heart pain we will never regret. If we’re not torn up by our brokenness, we won’t understand how badly we need to be saved from ourselves. As Jesus said, “It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners” (Mark 2:17).\n\nIf we’re honest, it’s exhausting, trying to “manage” our sin and remain pure in our own strength. Luckily, it’s okay to admit we’re a mess! If we didn’t have a forgiving God, that would be a different story. But Scripture tells us that “if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9). Because Jesus’ sacrificial blood covers us so completely, the Father will never again look on us with anything but steadfast, unwavering love.\n\nWe can take responsibility for our wrongdoing because our God is outlandishly gracious. Of course, we shouldn’t abuse the Lord’s grace by purposely sinning (Romans 6:1–4). But when we do fail, we can remember the story of the prodigal son returning home and his forgiving father running toward him, arms opened wide to welcome him (Luke 15:20).\n\nIn the same way, our Father in heaven runs to embrace His returning daughters. When the Spirit convicts our hearts, we ought to lean in to that godly grief with nothing to fear in Christ. Our sins are already forgiven in the finished work of Jesus. When we turn to God in repentance, we are returning our gaze back to the One who longs to be gracious to us and show us compassion, over and over again (Isaiah 30:18).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 8:1-24, John 1:1-3, Philippians 2:4-11\n\nI like to think I’m a generous person.\n\nI happily give to people and causes that matter to me. My family supports campus ministers, international children’s relief organizations, and our local church. We donate stuff we don’t want or use anymore. We pat ourselves on the back, sometimes share on social media, and then go on our merry way. It doesn’t hurt, and it makes us feel good. But are we generous? \n\nHere’s what we really are: comfortable givers. \n\nPaul is writing to comfortable givers in this chapter of 2 Corinthians. He is fundraising for the Jerusalem fund, a task he mentions throughout his letters as he travels and writes to various Gentile churches. Specifically, he is asking Gentiles (non-Jewish converts to Christianity) to send money for the poor in Jerusalem (likely Jews), which Paul references in Acts 24:17. \n\nIn 2 Corinthians 8, Paul tells the wealthy Corinthians about the overflowing generosity of the poor Macedonians for the Jerusalem fund. “They begged us earnestly for the privilege of sharing in the ministry to the saints,” he writes of the Macedonians’ eagerness to give (v. 4). \n\nIn essence, Paul is describing the Macedonians with an unnatural equation: severe trial + affliction + extreme poverty = abundant joy + wealth of generosity. \n\nThis equation can only be true in the math of mercy. Paul has no shame about telling the Corinthians how generously the Macedonians have given, and that he expects them to do the same. He is asking them for money—and a lot of it—using words like “surplus” and “generous.” \n\nBut here’s why it seems Paul isn’t afraid to ask for money, why he is bold in telling the Corinthians just how much the Macedonians sacrificed to give: because we learn to give from the great giver Himself, Jesus. Paul is reminding the Corinthians—and us—that when we believe in Jesus, our hearts are molded in the shape of His. “For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: Though he was rich, for your sake he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich” (2 Corinthians 8:9).\n\nWe love because Jesus loved us first (1 John 4:19). We give because Jesus gave everything for us and to us. And so we don’t just give money; we give ourselves. This can look like radical or everyday hospitality—acts of service on a grand, public scale, or little ones like changing the millionth diaper or washing yet another dish, simply so someone else doesn’t have to. \n\nGenerosity isn’t a series of acts or financial decisions. Generosity is a posture, a way of living in the way of Christ. Generosity is worship, an act done in response to the ultimate generosity of our living King Jesus. We don’t give or act generously to feel good or to check a box. We give to respond to Jesus. We give to break our hearts of their grip on material, physical comfort and let them reset in the shape of Jesus’ perfectly generous heart. \n\nWe live in a world of self-care and me-time and “treat yo-self.” We are entitled to comfort, or so we believe. When the Bible’s call to radical generosity rubs up against our idol of comfort, it should chafe a little. As members of Christ’s church, we’re called to be more than just comfortable givers. We look to Jesus and we see everything poured out for us. And becoming like Him, as we endeavor to “adopt the same attitude as that of Christ Jesus” (Philippians 2:5), means pouring everything out for Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 9:1-15, Psalm 126:1-6, Hosea 10:12\n\n“Jesus talked about money more than any other topic!”\n\nGrowing up, my dad issued this statement every time he spoke about stewardship. I have no idea if he was actually right—I have never tallied up the passages myself—but he was certainly on to something. Jesus was, without a doubt, concerned about our possessions. Between His parables and His one-on-one interactions, Jesus often addressed wealth, greed, investment, and stewardship. Whatever the precise frequency may have been, Jesus talked about money a lot.   \n\nIn 2 Corinthians 9, Paul seems to pick up where Jesus left off. He is bold and unashamed in instructing the Corinthians to give. His tone is straightforward, and He seems totally unembarrassed by the indelicate topic of money. \n\nThe combined witnesses of Jesus and Paul remind us of an oft overlooked truth: how we talk about money matters. God doesn’t simply want us to give; He wants us to do it for the right reasons, and to think about our finances in a holy way. Along those lines, Jesus and Paul both steer us away from two common errors in our language about finances. \n\nThe first error is thinking of our finances as private. When it comes to money, many of us have a hands-off approach; we don’t want to be told what to do with it. I have heard stories of church attendees walking out of the service, never to return again, simply because the sermon was about stewardship. Money is a touchy subject, and as a result, pastors can be skittish about discussing it. Some even apologize to their congregations on the rare occasion that they do address finances.  \n\nPaul, on the other hand, is unapologetic. He does not mince words when he warns, “Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly,” (v. 6). Based on passages like this one, it’s impossible to read Scripture and conclude that our money is nobody else’s business. God is not ambivalent about our wealth, but instead lays claim to it, so we cannot balk when our church community invites us to be generous.\n\nThe second error in our thinking about money is that of the prosperity gospel. This error gives inordinate attention to wealth, and it worships a transactional god whose grace is something we earn. The prosperity gospel interprets Paul’s words in a materialistic way, promising that if you give your money away, you are guaranteed to make much more in return.\n\nPaul’s words in 2 Corinthians 9 seem especially vulnerable to the distortion of prosperity preaching, since he promises “whoever sows generously will reap generously” (v. 6). However, what distinguishes Paul’s message from the prosperity gospel is motivation. The prosperity gospel is motivated by material gain, whereas the “cheerful giving” that honors Christ is motivated by gratitude. Put another way, we express our gratitude to God by being generous with others, just as He is generous with us. \n\nWhat is interesting about these two errors is that they produce the opposite effect. One discourages us from talking about money, while the other over-emphasizes it. But Scripture offers a third option. We can and should talk about money, but in the right way and for the right purpose: to the glory of God, the love of others, and the good of the world. \n\nIn truth, our finances are really not our own. They are God’s resources, which we are called to steward well. “And God is able to make every grace overflow to [us], so that in every way, always having everything [we] need, [we] may excel in every good work” unto to Him and for His glory (v. 8).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 10:1-18, Jeremiah 9:23-24, Ephesians 2:8-9\n\nMany of us who engage with social media have seen it: folks emboldened by relative anonymity in the virtual world of the internet, or by the perceived distance from those with whom they interact. On social media a person can have a mouthful of opinionated vitriol to spew, but face-to-face they’re silent as a lamb. Those folks have what kids today call “Twitter fingers” (derivative of the phrase “trigger fingers”), a term used to describe someone who is always at-the-ready to take a proverbial “shot” at someone else on social media, while hiding behind an online persona or handle.\n\nI wonder if the Corinthians church thought Paul was guilty of the same kind of communication. His letters to them are certainly stern and authoritative, but in person, the apostle seems a good bit more tame. But Paul doesn’t take their accusations lying down. In 2 Corinthians 10, he fires back at the Corinthians’ claims, saying they are off-base because they are judging strength and boldness in the same way the world does. The world expects strength and authority to manifest as brute force or powerful, charming speech, but Paul argues that those things are inferior to the spiritual authority he’s been given in Christ. The apostle’s strength and authority are waging war in the spiritual realm—where the real work is done.  \n\nPaul’s words are strong, and they should be! He should speak as strongly as possible because he’s asserting that his authority comes from the Lord! It was by God’s power that Paul was even able to evangelize and establish the Corinthian church in the first place. It was because of the Lord’s grace that Paul had the strength, wisdom, and patience to have a shepherding presence for their community. \n\nThe Corinthian church had it all wrong. They thought Paul couldn’t support such bold words with action, and therefore, his spiritual authority shouldn’t be taken seriously. In truth, they should’ve been more eager to submit to his leadership because his authority was manifested with demonstrations of spiritual power. In fact, their own Christian lives were the fruit of Paul’s boldness and authority.\n\nFriends, I think the same is true of us. Yes, we’re supposed to be marked by our meekness and gentleness and patience, but let’s not mistake those characteristics for weakness. On the contrary, when we’ve cultivated the fruit of the Spirit of God, we are actually reflecting the God of heaven and earth more accurately. We don’t have to be the best speaker, the most outgoing, or the smartest person in the room to move and act in the power of the Spirit. I’d argue that the less emphasis we put on our own strength to win the favor of people, the more we rely on the Spirit of God to empower us to be the people God has called us to be. That way, whenever victory is won, all glory goes to God! \n\nSo be encouraged, and don’t worry about impressing others. Let us boast in the power of God instead, which lives in each one of us (2 Corinthians 10:17). May we be quick to boast of knowing Him, enjoying Him, being found in Him, and loved by Him (Jeremiah 9:24).\n\n",

It’s not a word I would typically use to describe myself in the classic sense. I’m rather small and hold limited muscle on my frame. I don’t exercise intensely, and frankly, I prefer rest and relaxation to exercise and exertion. What’s true of me physically is mirrored in my mental life. I’m a go-with-the-flow kind of girl with just enough “go” to make things happen, if needed. Striving and goal-setting aren’t ideas that get me too excited, and they definitely aren’t words that come out of my mouth with joy. \n\nWhen I’m operating at my best, I’m moving methodically, without too much urgency and typically without any real sense of the final destination. I prefer to envision the next stop along the path. And that is why it is absolutely hilarious when I’m asked, often, how I’ve accomplished what I’ve accomplished.  \n\nOver the years, I’ve met with success professionally. I’m now asked to speak and share my story of perceived success and strength with others. But what they are seeing isn’t me at all. They are witnessing the Lord’s hand in my life, and He has given me more strength than I could have ever imagined. God alone has grown and sustained the work in my life. At times it’s tempting to believe the hype myself and to focus on my accomplishments. Even to boast in them. But taking even a moment to dwell on these thoughts would be short-sighted and misguided.\n\nIn 2 Corinthians 11, Paul is sharing his temptation to do this very thing—to boast in his own strength. Some believed he was inferior to the “super apostles,” false prophets who were attacking him in order to discredit the gospel of grace Paul was preaching. \n\nIn a rebuttal of sorts, Paul begins to share his resume: his status as both an Israelite and servant of Jesus, whose accomplishments and suffering for the cause of Christ would supersede most anyone’s in his time and in ours. He brings up his shipwreck, his floggings, and the dangers he endured for the sake of the gospel. But just when you think he’s going to give the final uppercut, he flips the script and says:\n\nIf boasting is necessary, I will boast about my weaknesses.\n\n—2 Corinthians 11:30\n\nIn this chapter, Paul creatively reminds himself, the Corinthians, and us, that boasting of anyone or anything other than Jesus is foolish. Any boasting we partake in should point to God’s power and grace. Paul’s perspective brought him back to gratitude for our Savior. Finding Jesus in our weaknesses should do the very same thing for us. All glory and all praise belong to Him alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 12:1-21, Mark 14:32-36, Philippians 4:10-13\n\nIt was just a common cold, then an infection, and then another infection from the antibiotics the doctors had given me to fight the first infection. Then, after being in bed for a week, my lower back started to hurt. To add insult to injury, I cracked one of my molars on a seed in my bread, and ended up having to get a root canal. For four weeks it was one thing after another. I don’t get sick often, so this debilitating month was like an object lesson in the absolute frailty of my body. Nothing was really related to anything else; it was just a perfect cluster of unfortunate events all smashed up against one another. \n\nI don’t know about you, but I can manage a simple cold. I can even manage a tweaked back. But when all the world seems to conspire against me when I simply get out of bed, eat anything harder than yogurt, or I’m on my third round of antibiotics in a month—well, I begin to despair. In that moment, I couldn’t remember what it felt like to be well, let alone remember what it felt like to be cheerful or whole or able to manage anything. I felt like a walking mistake.\n\nHave you ever felt like that? \n\nMaybe it’s not physical for you; maybe it’s emotional. Or maybe it is physical, but to an extent that makes my month of maladies seem like a walk in the park. Perhaps it’s mental or spiritual—I don’t know. But I do know that sometimes God’s grace does not feel sufficient for my weakness. Nothing about me, or Him for that matter, seems sufficient in days and weeks and months like these. \n\nYet, in 2 Corinthians 12, Paul lists the weaknesses in which he finds contentment: insults, hardships, persecution, and calamities, not to mention the thorn in his flesh God hasn’t removed. Paul is not saying these things don’t exist or that they aren’t hard. He isn’t putting on a brave face or being courageous in the midst of difficulty. He’s not even saying it’s okay to simply accept the thorn as it is. No, he begs God to remove it. But, in the midst of all this very real pain and difficulty, Paul’s contentment is not in his ability to weather the storm, bear the pain, or be brave. His contentment is in the sufficiency of God’s grace. \n\nWhen I’m struggling with anything, I want to find contentment in God’s sovereign ability to change everything in an instant, to heal what is broken right now, to right what is wrong. What I don’t want to be contented with is simply walking through the difficulty—be it physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual—in the knowledge that His grace is sufficient, that He is bearing this with me, and He hears me. And even if He hasn’t answered my prayer according to my wishes, He is still sufficient for me in my weakness, emptiness, pain, and sorrow. \n\nPaul’s words to the Corinthians in this passage remind me that sometimes God doesn’t change our circumstances, not one bit. But He does change our hearts in the midst of everything, making us more like Him. Jesus’ words to Paul and to the Corinthians are a promise to us as well: \n\n“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is perfected in weakness.”\n\n—2 Corinthians 12:9\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 13:1-13, John 15:1-8, Colossians 1:9-12\n\nThink about the words you would use to describe the Church today. \n\nWhen Paul wrote his letters to the Corinthian church, he didn’t know what the Church today would look like. Designations like Catholic and Protestant, Reformed and Arminian, even conservative and liberal, didn’t exist. And yet, in the newly formed Church of Paul’s day, they still needed to pursue unity. Dissension fractured the new body of believers, much as it has for centuries. The study of Church history is the study of fractions, disjointed parts that make a whole. \n\nThe last chapter of 2 Corinthians is Paul’s plea to his Corinthian brothers and sisters. A brief review of Paul’s relationship with the church at Corinth might be helpful here as we close our study of both letters. \n\nFirst Corinthians is Paul’s instruction manual to Corinth. He clarifies new Christian traditions and social positions (everything from spiritual gifts to marriage to the Lord’s Supper). Factions in the church had begun to form around different interpretations of these traditions. Church leaders who opposed Paul began to gain traction around their interpretations, and Paul responded with a strong letter of rebuke (which was lost). \n\nMany Corinthian believers responded well to Paul’s rebuke, and found sure footing again. But dissenting factions remained, and it is to these people that Paul addressed 2 Corinthians. Paul really puts himself out there in this letter. It is his apologetic for himself as a leader, but also for the cause of Christ. 2 Corinthians is emotional and strong, like the closing arguments of a political debate or a courtroom drama. \n\nMany scholars and commentaries refer to 2 Corinthians as Paul’s apologia pro vita sua, a latin phrase which means “a defense of one’s life.” He defends himself, he defends the body of Christ, and he defends the faith. Church unity is one of Paul’s soapboxes. He returns to it over and over, and in his closing statements to the Corinthians, he says this: \n\nAim for restoration, comfort one another, agree with one another, live in peace.\n\n—2 Corinthians 13:11\n\nRestoration, comfort, agreeableness, peace—as the body of Christ, Paul calls us to these things in this important epistle. Can you imagine if those words described the Church today, let alone the Church throughout history? \n\nHere’s what I believe about the Church, in a rather church-y metaphor. When you look at a piece of stained glass, you see one of two things first. You can see the whole beautiful picture, or you can see the hundreds or thousands of smaller pieces of glass. All of those different pieces of glass have a purpose; they bring a unique color, perspective, shape, or function to the whole piece of art. But the primary goal of all of those little pieces is to come together to present one beautiful message to its audience. \n\nUntil Christ returns, the Church will always be made up of thousands of pieces, expressions, or denominations. Each one brings something different to the body, yet all too often, we err on the side of contentiousness, distrust, or outright anger toward those other parts of the body. But our prayer should always be, as Paul’s was, that we present a mature, unified picture of the body of Christ, being of the same mind, at peace with one another and with God. In this way, we will display the glory and the heart of our King, Jesus Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nYesterday I went to visit my husband at his office–a newly constructed, all-glass-exterior building with marble floors and a sense of importance that seemed to demand awkward elevator silence, especially as I stood there with my out-of-place bag of ice cream from the shop across the street. \n\nI stepped out of the elevator and onto his floor, greeted by a kind receptionist who asked me to fill out a form on the tablet on her desk. It asked my name and then for my “host.” I typed in my husband’s name, and out popped a nametag: my name, followed by my host’s. My entrance into the building was guaranteed by his name.\n\nWhen Paul opens his letter to the Galatians, he goes through the same practice: “Paul, an apostle—not from men or by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead” (Galatians 1:1). Paul gains entrance into the church by his apostleship, dependent wholly on the person and work of Christ. He establishes his authority not by his own work or identity, but that of Jesus and His resurrection from the dead. \n\nPaul’s identity is the righteousness of Christ, and he repeats it throughout his letters. In his first letter to the Corinthians, he writes, “By the grace of God I am what I am” (1 Corinthians 15:10). In other letters, he introduces himself as “Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God” (2 Corinthians 1:1; Ephesians 1:1). And in Philippians chapter 1, the apostle refers to himself (as well as Timothy) as a servant of Christ Jesus. Paul fully embraces his new identity because it was given to him through faith in Christ, summing it up in this way: \n\n“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation;  the old has passed away, and see, the new has come!  Everything is from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation…  Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ…” — 2 Corinthians 5:17–18, 20\n\nWhen Paul introduces himself, it is as though he is writing on one of those “Hello! My Name Is” stickers, one that says: “Hello! My name is Paul, and I belong to Christ. Everything I am is because of everything He did.” \n\nGalatians opens with a precious reminder and a challenge to remember: If we are in Christ, then we belong to God, and our identity is now bound up in Christ’s death and resurrection. We are sealed by His Spirit, waiting for the day Jesus returns. And we can trust Him, as the psalmist says, because He is our portion and our cup of blessing (Psalm 16:5). He holds my future in my hands, and the boundaries He has drawn around my life are good for me (v.6). \n\nThere are so many days I feel like a hundred pieces of a puzzle, strewn about on the floor just waiting to be put together. I am a wife, mother, employee, friend, volunteer coordinator, chef, sister, daughter, and also somehow sometimes my own person. It is deeply refreshing to remember the truth today—that I am Melanie, through Christ and by the Spirit, a servant of God. From that one identity, everything else should flow, all for His glory. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nMy daughter is in a truly delightful developmental stage that is characterized primarily by make-believe. She spins magical tales and recites them with flourish, keeping us entertained and amazed at her creativity and sense of humor. Some of her stories are easy to identify as play—I know empirically that, no matter how awesome it sounds, a seagull did, in fact, not land on her head and take a seashell that she had balanced there. \n\nBut some of her stories are harder to sift out truth from make-believe. Did she really swim without a life jacket at camp? Despite all the assurances that she would always have a Personal Flotation Device, it’s possible the counselor forgot. Maybe? Sussing out fact from fiction in these scenarios is hard, a delicate balance of demanding honesty and encouraging her storytelling, creativity, and play. \n\nWhen fiction is easy to identity, we delight in the power of story. When the line between truth and embellishment blurs, it is easy to believe first and question later. This is exactly Paul’s point in today’s part of the letter to Galatians. “I am amazed,” he writes, “that you are so quickly turning away from him who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—not that there is another gospel” (Galatians 1:6–7). Paul pulls no punches, telling them, “If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, a curse be on him!” (v.9). \n\nFurthermore, in 2 Corinthians, Paul admonishes, “For if a person comes and preaches another Jesus… you put up with it splendidly!” (2 Corinthians 11:4). The warning is two-fold: Stay true to the one true gospel and to Christ, and do not follow or teach a false gospel. \n\nMore often than not, the false gospels I am drawn to are not patently false at first glance. They dance on the line of biblical orthodoxy, skirting around it and often adding to it. A real Christian should live this way! they say, along with a pseudo-salvific claim to living out some expectation of modern life. Today’s false gospels bend Scripture, asking it to do or be something it’s not— adding to it to say something it does not say, or twisting what it actually does say. Which is exactly what the false teachers in Galatia were doing: adding a requirement of circumcision and following other Jewish laws to become a Christian.\n\nI actively fight against the temptation of false gospels every day by engaging in Scripture, the north star that always points us exclusively to Christ. Filtering out falsehoods and embellishments is the work of the Holy Spirit in my heart through the means of grace that is the Word of God. I am so thankful for it. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\n“The gospel is about transformation,” a friend of mine said while standing in my kitchen a few days ago. We were talking about a series of current events in the Church, sad and hard and deeply personal stories that call us to question our place in the current manifestation of God’s kingdom on earth, as all such stories tend to do. His statement hardly revolutionary, nor was it original, but I’ve found it’s been rolling around in my head ever since.\n\nWithout total transformation, a turning-inside-out by grace, it can be hard to stand firm in the faith. Every day it feels like I see another domino fall, the ripple effect of false gospels and faulty foundations. I say this full-well knowing that I could be next. Every day I pray for a deeper and greater transformation of my heart. Prayer, Scripture, Spirit—these are my lifelines to a new heart and a closer communion with God. Without them, I’m weak and tired. With them, I am transformed. \n\nAs we’ve read through Galatians 1 this week, Paul has been building a case for the rest of his letter using his own story of transformation. First, he identifies himself and his motivation: an apostle through Jesus. Second, he introduces his critique: the church in Galatia has fallen under the spell of a false gospel. Third, he qualifies his critique and message because of his own past and the total transformation he experienced through Jesus. \n\nPaul uses his story, constructing it carefully, to set the stage for the rest of the letter, in which he will challenge false teachers who argued that new Christians had to submit to Jewish law. Paul had been a pharisee, self-described as “extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors” (Galatians 1:14). He knew the law. He lived by it and for it. \n\nThen Paul explains his own total transformation as “when God, who from my mother’s womb set me apart and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me” (vv.15–16). Paul became an apostle of Jesus; he knew his Savior, and lived by Him and for Him. God called Paul to Himself, and through the work of Christ and the indwelling of the Spirit, Paul was totally transformed. The same transformation is offered to us by God’s grace. \n\nI love how God calls them to Himself in Joel 2 (harkening back to Exodus 34) where God reveals His character to Moses: \n\nEven now—\n\nthis is the LORD’s declaration—\n\nturn to me with all your heart,\n\nwith fasting, weeping, and mourning.\n\nTear your hearts,\n\nnot just your clothes,\n\nand return to the LORD your God.\n\nFor he is gracious and compassionate,\n\nslow to anger, abounding in faithful love,\n\nand he relents from sending disaster (vv.12–13).\n\nThis is the invitation before me this morning: to turn to God, to anchor myself in prayer, Scripture, and the Spirit. Because I can trust God and His character, I can trust His process of transformation—His grace, compassion, patience, and steadfast love.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nWe named our cat “Maple” after a Robert Frost poem of the same name, about a girl named Maple who lives her whole life beholden to a name that almost everyone gets wrong. Everyone thinks her name is “Mabel,” because that’s a real name, and it is much more comfortable to call someone a real, normal name than a strange name. \n\nHer teacher’s certainty it must be MabelMade Maple first take notice of her name.She asked her father and he told her, “Maple—Maple is right.”“But teacher told the schoolThere’s no such name.”\n\nA name with no eponymous history made a girl feel strange and unseen, as if because her name wasn’t real or familiar, she wasn’t either, and thus goes the poem and her life story. \n\nWhen Paul writes the letter to the Galatians, he calls out the false teachers who cried, “you can’t be Christian without being Jewish,” and asked Gentile (non-Jewish) Christians to follow Jewish laws, particularly those regarding circumcision and food. Their ideas were rooted in ethnic and cultural expectations that Paul was unafraid to challenge. \n\nSimilar to the teacher in “Maple” who wanted her name to be “Mabel,” the Judaizers assumed that Christians should look and eat like Jews (see Acts 15:5), because that made sense to them. The message of “be like us to be a Christian” is deeply wounding, rooted in racial superiority and cultural authority. It is not unfamiliar to any era in Church history, from the first to the present.\n\nThe radical transformation of faith in Christ, Paul claims, equalizes everyone. Sin flattens us, all unworthy. But Christ redeems us, and presents us beautifully clean, whole, and unified before God. Christianity is open and welcoming to all, and in it “there is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male and female; since you are all one in Christ Jesus,” Paul writes in the next chapter (Galatians 3:28).\n\nPaul talks often of the body of Christ (Romans 12:3–8), and the rubber of ethnic differences meets the road of his ministry in Galatians. And in chapter 2, he specifically explains that the apostles to the Jews (James, Peter, and John) agreed with him that there was no need for Titus or other Gentile Christians to submit to Jewish ritual law. \n\nIt feels so personal to wade into this water: the rolling waves of our differences as humans. I feel Galatians reading me as much as I am reading it. What expectations do I have for other believers, and for myself? What do I think Christians should look like, act like? How should they think and feel? What do I add to the truth, or what do I believe that others have added? \n\nIn his commentary on Galatians, Martin Luther wrote, “The world bears the Gospel a grudge because the Gospel condemns the religious wisdom of the world.” The gospel calls us into deep and equal fellowship with all other believers. Anything less is hypocrisy. \n\nOver and over, Jesus confronted the religious wisdom of the world. Paul shows us how true discipleship and evangelism should be shaped by Christ, not the world. It is as simple, and as profoundly complicated, as “God does not show favoritism” (Galatians 2:6). We can substitute categories from centuries of Church history into the slots of “Jew” and “Gentile,” but the truth does not change. The gospel is just as true for you as it is for me or anyone else. Our salvation is based only on the finished work of Christ—nothing we do or don’t do can change it. We are secure in our Savior. Thanks be to God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI once took a conflict assessment (like a personality test, but for workplace conflict styles) that revealed to me that I have a “collaborative” conflict style. This means when conflict arises, I try to identify solutions that work for everyone. This is often a recipe for disaster. \n\nI like to present a lot of options and then back slowly out of the room (metaphorically) and not make any decision that will make other people upset. I am a problem solver, but in the “here are a bunch of ways to solve it, you decide!” kind of way. \n\nPaul is not like that, and especially not in his conflict with Peter. \n\nThe latter half of Galatians 2 is one of the strongest rebukes of an apostle in the Bible. Paul calls Peter a hypocrite who deviated from the true gospel. Peter had been eating non-Jewish-law-approved meals with Gentile Christians. But when a group of radical Jewish leaders called the circumcision party disapproved, Peter stopped eating with Gentiles. The Judaizers believed that to be a true Christian, a Gentile had to become Jewish first and follow Jewish law. \n\nIn his book, Galatians for You, Tim Keller writes, “Paul did not simply say: You’re breaking the rules (even though Peter was), but: You’ve forgotten the gospel: your own gracious welcome in Christ. Paul did not focus so much on the sinful behavior as on the sinful attitude of self-righteousness that lay beneath it.”\n\nLiving out the gospel often rubs against cultural best practices, be they ancient or modern. More often than I wish, I capitulate like Peter. I wonder, how can I live out my faith but in a way that doesn’t make other people angry or uncomfortable? I live in the irreconcilable tension of seeking the approval of both God and man (directly antithetical to what we read a few days ago in Galatians 1:10). \n\nAfter rebuking Peter, Paul goes on to make one of the most impassioned, beautiful expositions of the true gospel. He says, “a person is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ… I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing” (vv.16,21). \n\nPaul spends the rest of Galatians building on this truth: the traditional Jewish law does not save or purify people, only faith in Christ who died and rose again. The approval of other people doesn’t save you either, and you only need acceptance by God the Father, gained by the righteousness of Christ given to us when we believe. All we need is in Christ. All we have is Christ. Christ did not die for nothing; He died for you and me.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nAs an early twenty-something, I loved crafting handwritten letters. Throw in some turquoise calligraphy ink and a wax seal, and you had an elegant artifact from the past. Letters have a level of intimacy and importance that texts simply can’t convey, and each one is a labor of love. \n\nDuring this letter-writing phase, I also had what you might call a spiritual crush on the Apostle Paul. (C. S. Lewis was a close second, but, you know, he can’t compete with an actual apostle.) Paul’s legendary passion for truth was compelling, and as a twenty-something weaving together a worldview, his letters served as models for discipleship in my life. One evening at Starbucks, I handed out “epistles” to my friends—handwritten notes of encouragement that challenged them to persevere with hope. \n\nThe book of Galatians is considered one of Paul’s most intense epistles. Although his language was strong and corrective, it was also a labor of love. His intent wasn’t to admonish the Galatians just to cool his head; it was to expose a false gospel that had begun seeping into the community. This false gospel was reverting back to justification through law. When Paul calls these people “foolish” and like those with “a spell” cast over them (Gl 3:1), it’s because their version of the gospel had them in bondage. With a sharp prod, he pushed back against their habits. “Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law,” asked Paul, “or by believing what you heard?” (Gl 3:2). \n\nThough they had first believed the Spirit through hearing, they soon sought salvation through human performance again. I admit, I understand the temptation. Following a law is so much easier because it’s a visible, measurable act. But the realm of belief? Well, that can feel far more terrifying—a mere “whistling in the dark,” as Frederick Buechner puts it. But Abraham’s promise of faith is more than just a haunted optimism. It’s the very foundation of his covenant with God (Gl 3:7–9).\n\nAs an apostle of Christ, Paul’s role spurred him to awaken people out of disobedience by calling out ungodly behavior. Yet, as an apostle of Christ, he wasn’t calling them out from a place of anger or indifference. He was moved with compassion over how their efforts were sabotaging their own freedom. \n\nBecause it was for our freedom that Christ came.\n\nIt’s hard to trust God if we distrust his method of salvation. The promise of faith is a gift, but goodness gracious is it hard to accept sometimes. I’m thankful for figures like Paul or Martin Luther or, most importantly, the Spirit on this faith journey. When we surrender our own strength or desires to control the outcome and give ourselves over to the work of the Spirit, true freedom awaits. Let’s keep walking that long obedience in the same direction, together. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nLight wanes\n\nOn Wednesday evening of this last Holy Week, I attended the Tenebrae service through a local Anglican church. Held at the Belcourt Theater, this service draws its name from the latin word for “darkness” and is intended to capture the depth of sin and brokenness—without resolution. \n\nOn the stage, there was a tier with twelve candles. Traditionally, one candle at a time is snuffed out until the room is completely dark, encouraging people to leave the room in silence. The purpose is to sit with the sorrow of Christ’s death longer than we feel comfortable with so that the triumph of Resurrection Sunday is all the more joyous. \n\nI was nervous to attend. Friends described it as being a pretty visceral experience, and since I already have a personality that’s sharply attuned to darkness and suffering, I wasn’t sure it was the best idea. But the event was meant to commemorate the fact that Christ had been crucified to break the curse of sin and death. The very least I could do was sit in an old theater seat.\n\nDarkness grows\n\nIn the dark rows, candlelight flickering, we watched the opening piece: the music video to Johnny Cash’s song, “Hurt.” I couldn’t help but see the connection between that haunting lyric and Christ’s agony in the garden of Gethsemane:\n\n“What have I become, my sweetest friend? Everyone I know goes away in the end”\n\nIn Galatians, Paul says that “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us” (3:13). Although God set the law in motion, it could never save us. It always pointed to the cross. Because the law leads to death, only death could satisfy sin and lead to eternal life. \n\nThe heaviness of what I felt during this Tenebrae service was just a sliver of what Christ felt on the cross. He carried the weight of the whole world’s suffering on his shoulders. Can you imagine? Yet, somehow, “for the joy that lay before Him, He endured the cross” (Heb 12:2). \n\nDarkness overcomes\n\nOver the course of the evening, I could feel my breaths grow shallow and staccato-like. My friends were right. It was hard to sit through. More than once, I closed my eyes and breathed deeply, hoping to ground my body, while at the same time hold close the story of my Lord’s suffering. Thinking about Christ being made a curse for our sake makes me shudder because there was such a cost to fulfill the demands of the law—a cost so great that the earth grew dark from the sixth to the ninth hour (Mt 27:45). \n\nLight reemerges\n\nBut the shocking beauty of the gospel is that this “great reversal” transforms Christ’s persecution into our blessing. The law is fulfilled and replaced with a promise, and we never need to fear the darkness again. The curse has been lifted. It is finished. \n\nLight endures\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nWhile reading the Bible, I’m often struck by what it must have been like living under the law—especially after Christ’s ministry on earth. For so long, the world followed an established, works-based system. How could people not be skeptical or disoriented by this new way of thinking? Even if it led to freedom, human nature often returns to what’s familiar if the cost outweighs our own good.\n\nThe gospel made it so that salvation was no longer dependent on perfect execution of the law. With Christ, it was all about receiving, not doing. Belief, not effort. Grace. \n\nTalk about feeling your way around in the dark! When you’re used to managing your own righteousness, trading in the safe familiarity of rules for the wild realm of belief sounds foolish at first. I totally understand why they were wary of this “good news.” But the law was never the whole story. The law’s purpose was only ever to serve as a placeholder “until the coming faith was revealed” (Gl 3:23). \n\nIn Galatians, Paul describes the law as being our guardian until Christ came. Maybe I just haven’t read that passage in the Christian Standard Bible translation before, but until now I’ve never, ever thought about the law in this way. Truly, how beautiful this is! In our cultural moment, I think it’s easy to condemn ancient God followers (especially the Pharisees) as being resistant to relinquishing their system. But the reason they held the law so close to their hearts was because, at the time, that was the direct path to righteousness. As it turns out, it wasn’t the ultimate path to life, but it had its own purpose to accomplish. \n\nI don’t know about you, but I’ve never loved the darkness. Whether it was navigating a dark night of the soul or waking up in the middle of the night to eerie tree silhouettes dancing on the walls, I usually regard darkness as the enemy. However, I recently encountered a new idea: darkness also nourishes, holds, and prepares. I just love this. You can see it in the creation story. Darkness always comes before light, but that doesn’t mean that light renders it irrelevant. It just fills and overwhelms it by its very nature.\n\nI think the law was God’s severe mercy. We couldn’t justify ourselves, and neither could religion, but God didn’t leave us to our own ends. He provided this strange guardian—holding, preparing us until Christ’s death and resurrection fulfilled the law and the prophets. \n\nNow, we have the sweet, sweet privilege of releasing our anxious work and resting in the knowledge that “through faith you are all sons of God in Christ Jesus” (Gl 3:26).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nOne of my closest friends, Rory, has a fierce loyalty to both Jesus and quality coffee beans. Lately, while coffeeshop crawling around town, we seem to keep coming back to the same topics: G. K. Chesterton, the Enneagram, men, and what she likes to call “ecumenical dialogue.” \n\nAlthough we don’t share a love for coffee, we do share a passion for the Church in all its broken, messy complexity. Having had exposure to a wide range of church traditions, these conversations always remind us that we long for deeper unity—remembering that God doesn’t align more with one end of the faith spectrum than the other: He is the spectrum. \n\nWhen Paul calls for unity in his Galatians epistle, he declares, “There is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male and female since you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Gl 4:28). Human nature just wants to divide. It doesn’t seem to matter if it’s denominational or sociopolitical or any other categorization: it wants to raise and lower inherent value to seek and further its own good. But the gospel is a hospitable, open table where everyone is honored. \n\nDuring Paul’s missionary journeys, he needed to clarify the heartbeat of the gospel to an ancient world that devalued Jews, slaves, and females. Religion was just one more system that marginalized them. The temptation to reserve the gospel for those who didn’t seem to need it as much began to quelch what should have been “good news.” Good news for all—not just those who already had all the freedom they needed. \n\nPaul urges us to remember that the kingdom of God isn’t discriminatory. It’s heaven extending its hand and inviting us to a feast as brothers and sisters. We are, communally, made in the complex image of God. No individual, no matter how impoverished in mind, body, or resources is exempt from His lavish hospitality. Although we’re born into this world enslaved, He adopts us and makes us not “a slave, but a son” and an “heir” (Gl 4:7). We are now all heirs to this grace.\n\nNo community is perfect, but my home church back in California does a beautiful job at pursuing unity. It’s quirky and hard to pin down theologically. The air circulation isn’t great, and the worship flows in and out of syncopation. But, boy, does that church know how to love. On any given Sunday, on your way to the Eucharist table, you may meet those who are wealthy or who ride a bicycle to work. Who have a PhD in early church history or who have never taken a college class. This church doesn’t quite fit or belong to any one denominational stream. And maybe the reason why I gravitate to churches like this is because I, too, never quite feel like I fit or belong. It’s churches like these that remind me why the gospel is good news. \n\nMay we always have a spirit of hospitality toward our brothers and sisters. After all, we’re all just looking for a family in which to belong, and Jesus has made us this hopeful promise: “I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you” (Jn 14:18).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nLast year, I told a good friend that my life felt characterized by loss. We were sitting in a two-story coffee shop, iced chai in hand, and I felt guilty as soon as I said it. After all, this wasn’t entirely true. Loss didn’t always steal my joy in those times of tasting God’s goodness and His many good gifts, but it always overshadowed it once my attention drifted to what had been taken away. My friend then did what he does best: challenge that belief. This didn’t need to be the story, or lens, through which I interpreted my life. We could learn to look for what was there, rather than what was missing. \n\nThe truth was I was enslaved to this false narrative, just like the Galatians were enslaved to former ways of living. It’s easy to read the New Testament and wonder why it was so hard for people to stay faithful to God after an encounter. These people had known God and been known by Him, yet they turned away. Why? How do people who were living so close to the time of Christ—and the formation of the early church—turn away from it? This was the question also burning inside of the apostle Paul. “But now,” he said, “since you know God, or rather have become known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elements? Do you want to be enslaved to them all over again?” (Gl 4:9). \n\nPaul is implying that real relationship should inspire loyalty and freedom. Instead, the Galatians had become enslaved to “weak and worthless elements” by reverting back to worshipping false gods. You see, human nature is human nature. Even after encountering God today, like the Galatians encountered Him back then, we still allow ourselves to be enslaved by untrue stories or objects of false hope. \n\n“Where, then, is your blessing?” Paul asks (Gl 4:15). We can’t receive the blessing of being sons and daughters if we are enslaved to the law, or false gods, or any other object outside of Christ. That is, in fact, the very curse of sin that Christ came to break. \n\nPaul so deeply desired that these people find freedom and a genuine commitment to God that He said He was “suffering labor pains” until Christ was formed in them (4:19). This type of personal interest only comes from someone who encounters Jesus, finds transformation, and seeks the eternal well-being of others. \n\nStaying close to Jesus is the only way to release the things we’re enslaved to. Whether it’s the narratives in our heads, or other tangible idols, we will never be able to fight hard enough against the inclinations of our own flesh. Victory comes through Christ alone. Victory and blessing. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI think a lot about how the circumstances of our birth affect our futures. I bet Isaac and Ishmael did too. Their mothers, Sarah and Hagar, represent the old and new covenants. Sarah was Abraham’s wife, and when she didn’t conceive, she impatiently sent her servant to conceive in her place. Her servant Hagar bore Ishmael. Sarah later bore Isaac. God established the old covenant to teach us our need for a Savior. When Christ came, He fulfilled the law and the covenant. And he ushered in the new covenant of grace.\n\nThis was an abstract and new concept for the Galatians, and the Judaizers were all over them—trying to draw them back into confusion and slavery to the law. Paul is trying to help us understand by putting it in terms we are familiar with: human efforts to solve divine problems. It’s in our nature to try to settle things on our own terms. And the ancient Mediterraneans of Galatia couldn’t fulfill the law any more than we can. Paul demonstrated that the Judaizers, in deceptively drawing the Galatians to rely upon the law of Moses for their justification, are not acting in accord with the promise given to Abraham, but are turning from that promise. \n\nSalvation does not come to us by the works of the law, even the law of Moses, which was literally given by God at Sinai. The pursuit of salvation by works of the law is not sufficient. The end result, as it was for Ishmael and Hagar, is to be driven out. Why? Because the only means of attaining the inheritance promised to Abraham, of true fellowship with God, is by faith. To rely on deceit, or only on the law, is to reject true salvation and freedom, which comes only by faith in Christ. \n\nNeither Isaac nor Ishmael could control the circumstances of their birth. Paul is reminding us that our identity is not established by what we have done or will do. It is not something we can earn. Rather, our identity is fixed with Christ. This should have a radical impact on how we live and think. We are simultaneously set free from the exhaustion and impossibility of earning God’s favor, and filled with gratitude for the inheritance we have so freely received. This gratitude, not the threat of the law, is the motive for Christian living.\n\nSarah represents the covenant of faith and grace, but Hagar represents the covenant of failed human effort. Ishmael was Abrahams and Sarah’s plan, but Isaac was God’s plan. The law is not a means to leverage salvation. Isaac received the inheritance of the promise. “Now you too, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.” (Galatians 4:28)\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nGive us an inch, and we’ll take a mile. Christians can fall prey to the same temptations as everyone else. It can be hard to know where to draw the line in our Christian freedom. We’re “called to be free,” but how free? (Galatians 5:13). What movies should we really allow ourselves to watch? How much time can we spend on our phones every day? How often do we actually need to be in church on Sunday morning? We are not bound by the ten thousand commandments, and we instead enjoy the freedom and grace of two: \n\n“‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’  This is the greatest and most important command. The second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’  All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commands” (Matthew 22:37–40). \n\nReally, in just these two commands, all are fulfilled. In this we see what Paul means when he calls the Galatians to “faith working through love” (Galatians 5:6). With this in mind, suddenly, it seems we actually have a lot of freedom.\n\nThe law of the Spirit is not rooted in a slavish obedience to the law of Moses, but in a loving obedience to the God of grace. The law itself was never designed to save us, as the Judaizers were teaching; it only signifies our guilt and condemns us, because we are unable to keep it (Matthew 5:17–20). But the gospel of grace delivers us from bondage to the law and its condemnation. We are indeed free! For in Christ, there is now no condemnation (Romans 8:1).\n\nThe Ten Commandments allow for freedom in Christ, but that freedom is not for us to see how much we can get away with; rather, it is freedom to bear the fruit of love for one another, as brothers and sisters. It is not to be used as an opportunity to return to the flesh. So how do we use our freedom rightly?\n\nThe Holy Spirit must quicken us inwardly. Our hearts must be circumcised, not our bodies. “Circumcision benefits you if you observe the law, but if you are a lawbreaker, your circumcision has become uncircumcision” (Romans 2:25). Outward acts of faith are not a measure of our identity in Christ. It is the inward washing of the Spirit alone that sets us free.\n\nIn fact, a faith that looks amazing from the outside can be deceptive. Man judges by the outside, but God judges the heart (1 Samuel 16:7). Our hunger for outward approval and reputation often ensnares us, and distracts us from our need for the inward work of the Spirit. The end result is a shallow and fruitless faith, which actually makes us “alienated from Christ” (Galatians 5:4). Furthermore, the pride of self-reliance also produced discord in the church at Galatia, prompting Paul’s warning: “If you bite and devour one another, watch out, or you will be consumed by one another” (v.15).\n\nTrue freedom is found in the love and Lordship of Christ, which “compels us” to love others as He has loved us (2 Corinthians 5:14–15). In Christ Jesus, we are free from bondage to the law, and free to serve Christ instead. He has called us to walk in the liberty of love. May we use our freedom to show our gratitude to Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI’m a list maker. I need them to clarify my thoughts, and my brain works best when I put pen to paper. There are the staples—Christmas lists, to-do lists, and grocery lists—but I also keep lists of the national parks we’ve visited (Glacier really is the crown of the continent), my favorite things about my good dog (that nuzzly pink nose), and foods I never, ever want to eat again. (I’m looking at you, Hot Pockets.)\n\nLists are a helpful way to show us all the angles of an idea. One word says a lot, but seven pointing to the same big idea really leave no room for confusion. In this passage, Paul gives us two lists: a list of death and a list of life—the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:19–23). And boy, do I love the look of that “fruit of the spirit” list. I want that list to be the accounting of my days—not the nonsense in other list.\n\nBut life is busy and complicated, and we often find ourselves shifting back and forth between these two lists. How do we find victory over sin that ultimately only leads to death? Paul very succinctly declares that the only means by which we may find victory over sin is to “walk by the Spirit and [we] will certainly not carry out the desire of the flesh” (v.16). Notice Paul doesn’t say we might not succumb to our flesh; he says we will certainly not—what a declaration!\n\nOur flesh wars with the Spirit (James 1:14–15), but Paul encourages us in this manner: “If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:25). This is a powerful image! We’re not expected to walk out our faith journey alone; instead, we must learn to yield to the Holy Spirit. In daily life, our heart’s proclivities lead us away from the Word and drown out the voice of the Spirit; it’s easier to listen to our senses, our circumstances, and our vain desires. Our inattention to the Spirit causes us to fall out of step with Him. Theologian John Owen put it this way: “Be killing sin, or it will be killing you.” \n\nDaily, hourly, we are to fix our attention on the Word, hide it in our hearts, and yield our desires to Christ— not by our own strength, but by yielding to the Spirit within us. We must bring our bone-dry souls to the Fountain of Life. As God promised to Ezekiel: “You will know that I am the LORD, my people, when I open your graves and bring you up from them. I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live” (Ezekiel 37:13–14).\n\nHere’s the good news: this is all God’s work; a life in step with the Spirit grows out of the Spirit of adoption that we have already received by grace. God calls us to live in the Spirit that He has already given, “for [we] are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from [ourselves]; it is God’s gift” (Ephesians 2:8). Though the world, the flesh, and the devil continually vie for our attention, God has extended to our very lips “the spring of the water of life” (Revelation 21:6). Drink freely. Drink deeply. Drink continually. Walk in step with His Spirit.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nSeptember is a busy month for all of us. In my neck of the woods we’re packing, renovating, homeschooling, working—and I’m still nursing a baby. You may also be experiencing a season like this right now. When I’m busy, it’s harder for me to deal tenderly with everyone else’s particular struggles. It feels like quite enough to manage my own burdens without even entering into the burdens of someone else.\n\nBut God has entrusted us with precious souls. Our friends, our parents, our children, our spouses—anyone the Lord brings before us—we are called to deal tenderly with each other. There is a huge cultural impulse toward “self-care,” but this is not what we as Christians are called to focus on. We are called to bear one another’s burdens, to walk alongside each other on this faith journey. We are called to focus on the Lord and care for others. Even when we’re busy. Even when the burdens of others seem inconvenient. Even when we really, really just want to push them away.\n\nFortunately, Paul delivers some practical direction for us. He shows what walking by the Spirit looks like in some very common and practical circumstances. His first instruction: deal tenderly with those overtaken in wrongdoing (v.1). To be overtaken in wrongdoing is to be caught by temptation and then falter. This is very different from someone who has chosen to deliberately walk in sin, willfully pursuing it. In order to love others well, we need to remember our own sinfulness and God’s grace to us. Yes, sin must be treated as sin, but always in the spirit of love, and in light of God’s forgiveness and constant love for us.\n\nAnd then we must make the way home easy, restoring them with a gentle spirit, responding in love rather than in wrath and fury. Remember the parable of the Prodigal Son? (Luke 15:11–32). We ought to make the way home easy, welcoming them, celebrating and rejoicing because what once “was lost [has been] found” (v.32).\n\nIt’s far too easy to deal with other people’s sins, well… sinfully. Ironic, huh? But knowing full well the battle between flesh and Spirit that actively wars within each one of us (Galatians 5:17), we ought to show mercy and tenderness toward those who stumble, because we, too, live only by the tender mercy of God. Apart from His grace, none of us could stand before Him.\n\nPaul’s second instruction is to carry one another’s burdens, both the circumstantial burdens of this life, like finances, food, and shelter, and also the burdens of sin and temptation. We are to be a strengthening influence for our fellow sojourners in the faith—succor in time of need, encouragement in time of weakness, support in times of faltering. “In this way,” Paul declares, “[we] will fulfill the law of Christ” (v.2). \n\nWow. What a statement. We like to make sure our neighbors are dotting their I’s and crossing their T’s, instead of seeking ways to love and serve them as Christ has loved and served us—as a humble servant, laying down His life in love for us. May we learn to follow the pattern of Christ, not in duty, but in love. In this way, we will not tire of doing good, but will reap the fruit of faithful love in the communion of the saints (Hosea 10:12).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nAt summer camp, I won an award for having curly hair. The curliest, naturally curly hair. I felt pretty proud of myself that night. The next morning at breakfast I assumed everyone was whispering, “Is that the curly hair queen?” Yes, yes, it is I!\n\nSigh.\n\nAnd goodness, isn’t this about the level of all the things we boast about? Things we truly have no control over? We can certainly work hard and make good choices. But our eye color and our physical achievements, our successes and our relationships—aren’t all these things really just gifts from God? \n\nInstead of boasting in what amounts to little more than circumstances from our birth, we are called to boast in the Lord (Galatians 6:14). And “the one who boasts should boast in this: that he understands and knows me—that I am the LORD, showing faithful love, justice, and righteousness on the earth, for I delight in these things. This is the LORD’s declaration” (Jeremiah 9:24).\n\nThe Hebrew word for God’s “enduring, covenantal love” is hesed. In his book Inexpressible, Michael Card defines hesed beautifully as, “When the person from whom I have a right to expect nothing gives me everything.” Our boasting then, is to be in the undeserved and overwhelming love of Christ, who—while we were His enemies, helpless in our sin—gave His life for us, so that we could be children of God (Romans 5:6–11).\n\nPaul’s benediction appeals to this same hesed, as he speaks to the Galatian church that had foolishly followed after the false teachings of the Judaizers, and wandered from the life of the Spirit. As he had earlier called on them to deal gently with those who are overtaken by sin, so also Paul deals gently with the Galatians. Why? Because Christ has dealt gently with Paul. And so Paul can boast in one thing only: the hesed of God, seen most clearly in the cross of Christ. He exhorts the Galatians to do the same.\n\nThe apostle then blesses the Galatians with a benediction that can only result from the steadfast love of God. Because of God’s undeserved and faithful love, we have fellowship with one another. We have restoration when we are overtaken in sin, and reconciliation with those we have offended, including Christ our Lord. Because of His love for us, we are part of the family of God, brothers and sisters, and co-heirs with Christ to the inheritance of God’s eternal kingdom.\n\nPaul goes on to bless the Galatians with the grace of Christ, for it is His grace alone which saves, restores, sustains, secures, and transforms us into His own likeness. This He does by the work of His Spirit in our spirits, in our hearts, and in our minds. In Him, we are a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nThe final note of Paul’s epistle to the Galatians is a resounding praise of Christ, in whom alone we boast. Next time you get ready to toot your own horn over your own achievements, remember that there’s no need to rejoice over ourselves, because our Creator already rejoices over us with singing (Zephaniah 3:17). Let His rejoicing over us be enough, and may we instead glory in Christ alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nI have a dear friend who wants to be a foster mom so badly, she can hardly speak of it without tears pooling in her pretty eyes. She longs to be a safe place for children without a home, to give graciously to those whose lives are marked by need, to be a friend to the teenager who is convinced she’ll always be alone.\n\nThinking about this, of course, makes me cry. Because I know my friend, I know the weight of these gifts she’s giving. And I know they aren’t simply gifts to one person or a few, but they are gifts to us all. So, all I can say is YES. Thank you for giving what you are not obligated to give to those who cannot repay you for your gifts. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nThis kind of overwhelming gratitude is Paul’s tone as he begins his letter to the Ephesians. Well, this times infinity. Paul isn’t giving thanks for a gift given only to himself, or only to a few. He is praising the Lord for the gifts given to all believers— indeed, to ANYONE who would believe in Jesus as Messiah.\n\nPraise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavens.\n\n– Ephesians 1:3 HCSB\n\nWhat are these blessings that have Paul borderline giddy, with his praise hands held high? In verses 3-14— which were a actually one, long sentence in the Greek— Paul declares three gifts, or blessings, that are irrevocably theirs (and ours!) in Christ. Let’s see if we can identify them together.\n\nBlessing #1: God the Father elects. (Ephesians 1:3-6)\n\nI know, words like “chosen” and “elect” and “predestine” make me squirmy, too. But they’re there, in black and white (and not just there, but throughout Scripture. Use John 6:44, Romans 8:29, Ephesians 1:5 as starting points for further reading). But before we get put our defenses up, consider this with me: What if we focused less on the selectivity we perceive in these words and more on the surety they present?\n\nWe know God saves us according to His love and mercy, not in response to any works of our own. (This is what Paul spent an entire letter scream-talking to the Galatians about in our last study! See Galatians 3:11.) Because our salvation is by Him alone, it must be intended and carried out by Him alone. He is the only one able to do it! Now, couple that with this glorious passage in John 1:12: “But to all who did receive Him, He gave them the right to be children of God.” God gives guilty sinners undeserved gifts and makes them our right.\n\nElection is not a hoop to jump through. Election means there is no hoop! God chose us. All the hoops are null because Christ jumped through them all for all.\n\nBlessing #2: the Son redeems. (Ephesians 1:7-12)\n\nThe first blessing is eternal—God chose us before He poured the world’s foundation, and we reap the benefit yesterday, today, tomorrow, forever. Likewise, our redemption in Christ is a present and eternal promise. We are forgiven now, and we will be forgiven still. The redemption gained by Christ’s blood will never expire.\n\nNot only that, but Christ’s sacrifice unifies all believers. Paul’s letter was written to the earliest Christians, who knew people as belonging to one of two categories—Jews and Gentiles. That God’s plan of redemption included any and all who would believe, regardless of their ethnicity, was radically good news.\n\nBlessing #3: the Spirit seals. (Ephesians 1:13-14)\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the fulfillment of Christ’s promise to send a Counselor (John 14:26). But the Spirit is also Himself a promise, a down payment of our full redemption and future glory. God is the only One who can give eternally, not bound by time and space or any other limitation. His promises are as good as fulfilled the moment He makes them! God gives us the Holy Spirit to be with us now as we await Glory, but also as our Glory guarantee (Romans 8:30).\n\nWhew. That’s a lot of blessing, you guys.\n\nIt’s no wonder Paul rattled all this off in one, long, Greek sentence—this is incredible and incredibly life-changing good news! Salvation is a gift sovereignly and freely given by God, redemption is fully accomplished by the Son, and our future glory is safely sealed by the Spirit. \n\nFriends, this message was not just for the churches in and around Ephesus. This message is for you and me. We have been given a wealth of gifts we can never earn, a heap of blessings we can never repay, only because our good God desires to give them.\n\nYES. Thank you, Lord, for giving what You are not obligated to give to we who are only made worthy by the sacrifice of your Son. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Annie Downs\n\nIt’s not unusual for me to be in a room full of people who are smarter than I am. It’s partly because that’s a goal of mine: to surround myself with people who are significantly better at life than me. But it’s also because I’m just not Harvard material. I may have an above average funny bone, but my brain is pretty average.\n\nA few years ago, I was selected to be in a month-long class full of people who are massively impacting the world and doing it with their impressive brains and contributions to society, through technology and non-profit work. I kind of snuck in—it was the favor of God for sure. For an entire month, I sat around a table with ten people of different religious and regional backgrounds from me, and certainly a much higher pedigree. My average brain and I were one of a kind.\n\nEarly on in that first week, I realized I didn’t have what it took to hang with that crowd; and the worst part was, they knew it, too. It wasn’t long before I was being overlooked in conversations and ignored by my peers when group work was being done. They had weighed my brain and found it wanting.\n\nEach day, I took the train from one side of town to the other in order to attend this symposium, and the commute gave me time to read my Bible and journal a bit. I was desperate for God’s help every day, nervous to go in and sit with that group of rockstars, wishing to avoid the embarrassment of not being smart enough for them.\n\nBut God steered me toward Scripture about what our minds can really do—what MY mind can do. We can pray for our brains to be enlightened because we’ve been given the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16). Our actual thinking and ideas are sharpened by the indwelling of our all-knowing and all-powerful God! Even better, we can present those ideas with full integrity and honesty, because we have the mind of our perfect Savior.\n\nI began to pray earnestly that God would increase what my brain could do—not because I wanted to be the brainiest person in the group for that month, but because I realized I was the only representative of Christ in that room. How my brain showed up reflected Him. If Jesus really fills all things in all ways like Ephesians 1:23 says, couldn’t He do that with my mind? I wanted a transformation, a new wineskin (Matthew 9:17), a better mind. I wanted the mind of Christ.\n\nAnd as I prayed each morning, it happened. I don’t consider it an exaggeration to tell you it felt like a miracle to me. My capacity to remember increased, ideas came to me more quickly, and it felt like my brain muscle was getting stronger. As the month rolled on, my relationships around that table changed as they started hearing me, trusting me, and allowing me to equally contribute to the conversations. \n\nMaybe I’d become way smarter. But maybe, above all else, my confidence was through the roof. I HAD THE MIND OF CHRIST. I could share any idea, and whether it was loved or not, I believed it was a good one. Jesus had changed me; the power of prayer had worked for my good and for His glory.\n\nYears later, I am changed by that month, but not just by what happened in the classroom. I am far more changed by my time on the train and what God taught me there. The power of Jesus changes our lives, but it changes our minds, too. \n\nThese days, I run my own business. I write books for a living. I have to have a mind that is focused and increasing in knowledge constantly. I read books, I listen to podcasts and lectures. But the honest truth about any smarts I have is because of exactly what Ephesians says: I pray for spiritual insight. I pray for wisdom beyond my years and in spite of my tendency towards foolishness. I ask Jesus to do in my mind the miracles only He can do—fill me with the immeasurable greatness of His power. Everything good in me is for the glory of Christ (Philemon 1:6).\n\nOur strength is limited, but His strength is vast. Our hope wanes, but His hope is eternal. His Word says His riches and power are now ours (Ephesians 1:18-19). Let’s believe Him.\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sarah Matheny\n\nThe best day in all of social media, I would argue, is Thursday. On Thursdays we are treated to a little something the kids are calling “Throwback Thursday,” or #tbt. I don’t pretend to be able to keep up with social media trends, so I hope you’ll forgive me if I’m #doingitwrong.\n\nRegardless, Throwback Thursday is, in a word, awesome. After all, everyone loves a good makeover. Whether it’s simply to ridicule the past or embrace the present, I think we can all agree that witnessing a transformation is tremendously satisfying. That is, unless you are the casualty of someone else’s #tbt, and are left having to untag a very public photo of yourself sporting a spiral perm, Aqua-Net-frozen bangs, acid-washed jeans, bright yellow slouchy socks, and knock-off Keds. (That description alone confirms that I am indeed too old to be talking about any kind of current trend whatsoever.)\n\nWhen reading Paul’s words in the opening of Ephesians 2, we’d be remiss to equate his description of transformation with some sort of cute, little makeover. Not only would it minimize the transforming power of the love of Christ, which we’ll get to shortly, but it would also gloss over the depravity of sin.  \n\nPaul writes that when “we followed the ways of this world” we were dead (Ephesians 2:1-2).  He’s obviously not speaking of adhering to sad fashion trends here, or any other poor choices we’ve made, really. He’s talking about who we are in ourselves, about the nature of our flesh, and about the Enemy at work in our disobedience of God. He’s talking about death.\n\nWhen I think of the horror of sin in light of who Christ is and has created us to be, I remember those PSA-style posters they showed us in high school, the ones depicting the decline of a methamphetamine user. Each picture shows the individual falling further into their addiction, gratifying their flesh despite the severe cost to their wellbeing. The physical deterioration is alarming. Even more horrifying, though, is that you can almost see the life leaving their eyes. How can death be what God intended for His workmanship? It isn’t!\n\nSisters, this is what it looks like for any of us— or our neighbors, friends, and family— to live a life apart from Christ. Paul adds that we, left to our nature, are deserving of this dark fate and, even worse, the wrath of our our Creator (Ephesians 2:3). I’m so grateful there is a “but” in these verses!\n\nBut God.\n\nBut God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love that He had for us, made us alive with the Messiah even though we were dead in trespasses. You are saved by grace!\n\n– Ephesians 2:4-5 HCSB\n\nGod is the Author of our lives and of the change in our lives—not because we deserve it, but only because of His goodness, His mercy, and His love. There is no behind-the-scenes footage to be shown of the good works that earned us such a gift. No, this soul-deep change is made in spite of our behind-the-scenes footage! We are saved by grace. \n\nWe can marvel at the transforming power of His love. It’s a love that raises us up with Him on the resurrection side of the grave and makes us truly alive. It’s a love that makes us new. This is what we were made for! Not the death, depravity, and suffering we experience while trying to live life apart from Him.\n\nWe are His masterpiece. “He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things He planned for us long ago” (Ephesians 2:10, NLT). Obedience, service, Kingdom-building—these are no longer duties and burdens to be carried but blessings to be fulfilled. They are byproducts of being made new in Christ!\n\nThough God gently reminds us— by His Word and in His love— of who we once were, He will never leave us or abandon us. He will never throw us back, not even on a Thursday.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nIt’s so tough that we have to live with people.\n\nI mean, we would be so lonely without them, but it’s hard to get along, you know? My family is seven people. Seven mouths to feed, fourteen feet to shoe, one-hundred-forty fingernails and toenails to trim, and a million ideas about the purpose of a Saturday. It’s complicated. Even if you don’t have that many folks under your roof, it’s hard to keep the peace anytime we’re forced to rub shoulders with other imperfect humans.\n\nEven when times are so good, unity can be so hard. I always expected family life, or roommate life, to just feel like a basket of kittens. So why aren’t we all adorably snuggling and saying meow, meow already?\n\nThe early church had the same problems with unity that we have today. Paul tries to halt their squabbling by reminding them of this key truth: Christ is the cornerstone. Obviously your house is going to fall down if it’s not built on the cornerstone. Unity is enormously difficult, and the only way to have unity with each other is through Christ.\n\nBecause the folks in Ephesus were so busy slapping and kicking each other in the shins over whether or not circumcision is the one true way to salvation, Paul uses metaphors to get their attention and gives them a veritable technicolor slideshow of unity.\n\nPaul actually uses illustrations like this a lot in his letters, to deepen our understanding of our relationship to each other in Christ. Look how many I found with only a quick, cursory search:\n\nTogether, in Christ, we are:\n\na holy sanctuary (Ephesians 2:21, 1 Corinthians 3:16) \n\na body (Ephesians 2:15)\n\na city (Ephesians 2:19)\n\na family (Ephesians 2:19, Galatians 3:26, 29)\n\ncovered (Galatians 3:27)\n\nsons, not slaves (Galatians 3:23-26)\n\na creation (Galatians 6:15)\n\nWhew! As I noticed that Paul really rolled out the whole barrel of metaphors, I realized this concept of unity in Christ must require more than just passing consideration. It demands real attention to the texture of this truth, like we could comprehend more if we examine it from different angles. Let’s look at three of these pictures of unity together today.\n\nI am most intrigued by the picture of us as family in Christ (Ephesians 2:19). The issue of seamless family connection has always plagued me because I, like many of you, come from a home of divorce. So my family isn’t tidy or shiny; it’s funny and sometimes awkward. But Paul is saying we are “members of the household of God.” We have a rightful place, together, in Him.\n\nI’m also fascinated to think of us as a holy sanctuary (Ephesians 2:21). We are joined together to make a holy temple for the Lord. Together we are a place that is set apart, a place that God loves. It’s amazing.\n\nFinally, we can see our unity in the image of the city (Ephesians 2:19). I really like this one. In a city, everyone does different jobs, but it works because we are pulling together, just like we learned on Sesame Street. Except this unity works because we are in Christ—not because we are motivated by civic duty.\n\nGod brought the Jews and the Gentiles together. He’s still doing it today. He’s bringing the Hatfields and the McCoys together. He’s bringing me and my crazy family together. It’s super messy and complicated. Honestly, it’s horribly messy.\n\nHere we are, and God wants us all to be His people. Me, you, and your lunatic uncle. How can we all come together? In Christ. Christ is our cornerstone. We build on Him. He is the only source of unity.\n\nBefore you get out your mortar and trowel to start building, remember that unity comes from the Lord, and it is begun and completed by Him. We can’t achieve unity by our good work or our hard work—but He achieves it by His grace!\n\nLord, bring unity to our families and our communities. Give us the humility to see that our hands aren’t enough to build the Kingdom, but that your hands have already built it. You are our cornerstone, and “in you we are made one” (John 17:22).\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nSo say there’s this girl. Let’s call her Izzy. And there was a bully who taunted Izzy and beat her up, starting in kindergarten by calling her teeth yellow, and continuing to senior year by calling her heart yellow.\n\nWhat a relief to graduate and move on! But then, on her wedding day, her tormenter showed up at the reception, uninvited, eager to share champagne, strawberries, and first dances with Izzy and her new husband. Izzy tried to ignore it. But when she and her beloved reached to cut the cake that symbolized their new life together, a third hand tenderly joined theirs on the knife. Izzy couldn’t take it any longer. She shouted:\n\nGET OUT OF MY SPECIAL MOMENT! This is our special covenant together, and you are not included!\n\nThis awkward narrative makes us so mad and squirmy, but this is how the people of Israel felt when the Gentiles came out of the woodwork to join the church. This is our wedding feast. Go find your own.\n\nThe term “Gentiles” pretty much means everybody who’s not Jewish. It meant the Egyptians, Medes, Persians, and Babylonians— all those guys who tossed Israel around like game of keep-away. These are the nations who bullied and slaughtered Israel on and off for half of the Old Testament. \n\nIsrael did not want anything to do with these bad guys. And they had always seen the promise of the covenant as specific and exclusive to Abraham and his descendants (Romans 11:1-2). When they sang “Father Abraham…had many sons…” they meant it literally and ethnically.\n\nThe idea of including the enemy in their special family covenant was radical and unwelcome. Why would Israel want all the mean and dirty Gentiles involved in their intimate covenant with God? Wasn’t He their God?\n\nPaul lovingly tries to bring them around to the idea. He argues that this was actually God’s plan from the beginning (Ephesians 3:11). And not only was it God’s plan, but it’s God’s great grace to the Jews to allow them to minister to the Gentiles. God gave them the opportunity to become more like Christ—to show grace (Ephesians 3:7-9). The Gentiles became fellow heirs in Christ. And I am so grateful, because any of us who don’t literally come from the “many sons” of Abraham are technically Gentiles too.\n\nThankfully, my husband and I didn’t have to share our special nuptial moments with an intruder, but ours is a small picture of a greater marriage. At the marriage supper of Lamb, we will sit side by side with people who wouldn’t have chosen us to attend their special moments on earth. At the moment the Jews start feeling possessive about the covenant as their own, Paul admonishes them that it’s only due to God’s great grace and kindness that they are at the marriage supper at all.\n\nThe same is true for you and me. Yes, the covenant is ours, but we are that creepy third-wheel bully that doesn’t deserve to be there. We all picture ourselves as the bride, but the big news of the gospel is this: I’m actually the problem in the story. We are the ones who have been undeservedly invited in.\n\nOh, the depth of the riches of both the wisdom and the knowledge of God (Romans 11:33)!  We receive the goodness of God’s truth, His grace, and His salvation, and we get to share it. We may be natural born enemies, but we are equal heirs to the inheritance of the gospel.\n\nAfter this I looked, and there was a vast multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language, which no one could number, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were robed in white with palm branches in their hands.\n\n– Revelation 7:9\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nA word to the wise: do not prank call my parents today to ask if their refrigerator is running.\n\nThat is, of course, unless you’d like to trigger their post-traumatic stress involving a certain recent refrigerator leak… turned flood… turned home renovation. It was a rough time, you guys.        \n\nIn all seriousness, this Whirlpool really lived up to its name, creating a lagoon of lettuce water beneath the wooden floorboards, which curled up like soggy noodles. After clearing out all of the furniture and listening for weeks to the hum of many vacuums, my parents were relieved to make it to the simplest part of the process: choosing a replacement refrigerator. They ordered the model closest in appearance to its predecessor, measuring the length and width of the cabinet opening, checking and rechecking its size.\n\nIf you know anything about my dad, it’s that his yellow measuring tape is a force to be reckoned with. It’s always precise, down to the milli-est of meters. So it was with utmost confidence that my parents declared the dimensions of the new fridge’s home.\n\nBut when the delivery man placed the refrigerator in its compartment, there was a slight problem. Now, if you’re afraid I’m going to tell you the precious, yellow measuring tape was wrong, do not fear! Oh, it was correct. The length and width of the new Whirlpool slid snugly into the pocket where the former fridge once stood, but… it stuck out about 6 inches too far. While the length and width had been calculated to the exact millimeter, no one had considered the depth.\n\nEach time my parents step foot in the kitchen, they are stonewalled by the refrigerator’s annoying edge, an ever-present reminder of their miscalculation.\n\nWhen I read Paul’s words in Ephesians 3, I imagine they are the kind he’d like us to place in a conspicuous spot in our homes, maybe with magnets on the refrigerator:\n\n“I pray that you, being rooted and firmly established in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the length and width, height and depth of God’s love…”\n\n– Ephesians 3:17-18\n\nWe can guess that Paul, being the energetic guy we all know and love, didn’t intend these words to be admired only during our late-night cookie-dough raids. No, I think he was calling us out on our own miscalculations about God’s love.\n\nIf we, as Christ’s followers, understand and proclaim one thing about God, shouldn’t it be His love?\n\nSince love is the currency and cornerstone of our faith, and others will know we are Christians by that love (John 13:35), we’d like to think we have that part all figured out. But what if we don’t? Are we doing love wrong?\n\nPaul gives us this assurance: God’s love cannot be constrained by our own lack of understanding. God guarantees that His love will always obnoxiously stick out further than we think, bumping into our warm, fuzzy expectations with a reminder of Himself.\n\nIts length embraces us in a wingspan of Alpha to Omega.\n\nIts width includes us in the family tree of all believers.\n\nIts depth reaches us buried beneath the wages of sin.\n\nIts height draws us to eternal heavenly glory.\n\nLove establishes and anchors us in the gospel. It is longer, wider, deeper and higher than any dimensions we can muster. We can spend our days settling for a comfortable, comprehendible love, or we can seek to be stretched by the true fullness of His love.\n\nToday, may we make a space for Him to surprise us without limitation, so that we may see the true length, width, depth and height of the Father’s love. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nI’m a beach girl. I love the sun, the sand, the surf—everything. I can’t get enough. Recently, my brother moved to Jacksonville, Florida, and I’ve had the privilege of free beach vacations the last few years. Yes, please!\n\nWhile visiting my brother this past summer there was a tropical storm about 200 miles off the coast. Those were some of the biggest and most consistent waves I’ve ever seen.\n\nMy brother ran through the water and easily made it out to a calm sandbar. As I tried get out past the breaking point, the waves continually knocked me backwards, sideways, and underwater. Just when I made a little progress, an enormous swell came into view. In an effort to hit it head-on, I started running toward it, jumping forward and diving into the wave.\n\nAs the wave rolled over, it rolled me right along with it. Suddenly, I was somersaulting underneath the wave, no control over my body and no idea which way was up. I finally found my footing and came up from under the water. But as soon as I took a breath, another wave knocked me off my feet and pushed me even closer to shore.\n\nNeedless to say, I waved to my brother and went back to our towels. This was definitely a tanning day.\n\nThat feeling of no control, of not knowing if you’ll ever surface, doesn’t just happen in the water and the waves. It’s one we can experience spiritually, too. If we remain immature in our faith, we can easily be tossed back and forth by the craftiness, manipulation, and deceit of false teachers.\n\nSo how do we guard against this? According to Paul, our spiritual gifts play a huge role.\n\nChrist grants each believer unique gifts in order to serve the body of Christ. We are all created differently and given different gifts by our Creator, so that together we can work to reach unity in the faith and in our knowledge and understanding of Jesus Christ. In Christ, our diversity is an asset and, ultimately, a peace-maker.\n\nChrist’s design for spiritual gifts is to build up His Bride, the Church. The goal is for the body of Christ—the whole body— to reach maturity. Using our gifts in the right context, with a humble and willing heart, builds us up individually and collectively. It builds up the whole body of believers.\n\nThis is what Paul urges of the Ephesians: in order for the body to reach maturity, we must fully embrace the unity to which Christ has called us. His desire is for us to function as one, not function alone.\n\nI love Paul’s words in Philippians 1:27 which echo this calling, charging us to live in “a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ.” We are to stand firm with one mind and spirit, guarding each other, using our unique gifts, and working side by side as we advance the gospel.\n\nIn this way, Christ’s Bride will be presented, fully mature and unified, on the day of glory.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Vivian Mabuni\n\nI picked up a crumpled foil gum wrapper by the staircase. Three steps up I found another one. And then another. At the top of the stairs I found a few more. Curiosity piqued, I turned the corner to peer into my son’s room. Under a maroon-colored blanket I saw the shape of a preschooler. In front of the mound of blanket-covered-preschooler, I found a pile of gum wrappers. I walked up to the mound.\n\n“Michael? Are you under the blanket?”\n\nThe shape shook his head.\n\n“Michael? Are you chewing gum?”\n\nAgain, the shape shook his head.\n\nI lifted the blanket to find my son, cheeks stuffed like a chipmunk. His mouth was so full, he couldn’t bring his lips to close. Barely able to chew, Michael had managed to stuff an entire pack of chewing gum in his mouth.\n\nWhen it comes to sin, I’m not so different from my preschool-aged son. Like Adam and Eve in the garden, my first response to sin is to hide and cover (Genesis 3:7-10). Instead of an actual blanket, I often hide under a cloak of defensiveness or rationalization when I sin. You know what happens in the place of hiding and covering? Rotting, stinky, cold, isolated living—that’s what happens in the darkness.\n\nPaul brilliantly establishes in the first half of Ephesians our position in Christ and then spends the remainder of the letter addressing the practice of the Christian life. Our position should inform our practice, but often we confuse the order and attempt Christian conduct apart from understanding our standing before God. When we flip practice and position, we may seek to adhere to stringent dos and don’ts out of fear, or to earn brownie points. But living the Christian life through self-effort is unsustainable.\n\nGod did not abandon us to live the Christian life in our own strength. He is our Source and Provider. We invest time studying God’s Word in order to know Him, not just know about Him. As we know Him, we will love, trust, and obey Him, and our conduct flows out of this love relationship. We know Him by walking in the light, and we walk in the light by knowing Him.\n\nWhat’s more, God provides His Spirit to empower us to walk in the Light. The secret of the Christian life is being filled by and walking in the Spirit (Ephesians 5:18, Galatians 5:16), which comes through confessing our sin and yielding our lives to God in response to His goodness and mercy (Psalm 145:9). The word “confess” comes from a word meaning “to speak the same.” Speaking the same about our sin is to admit we blew it. No rationalization, no excuses, no hiding, no hiding under the blanket of our shame— only recognizing the beautiful truth that our forgiveness is complete because of Christ’s finished work on the cross.\n\nWhen we know our position— children of God who are forgiven, renewed, and provided for in Christ Jesus — then we can practice walking in the light, being imitators of the God who created us and saves us (Ephesians 5:1).\n\nLike lifting the blanket to expose my gum-chewing son, the gospel of Christ gives us the freedom to throw off our old sinful nature and be renewed by the Spirit (Ephesians 4:22-23). The darkness may feel deceivingly comfortable to us for a time, but true healing, freedom, warmth, connection, and community only happen in the light of Christ.\n\nFather, we want to know you and walk in the light. Show us through your Spirit the places in our heart where we hide and cover. Give us courage to yield our whole lives to you. Thank you for your perfect timing and perfect provision. We love you. Amen.\n\n \n\nVivian Mabuni is an author and speaker, and a sushi, white Christmas lights, coffee-with-friends-lover.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nShe was five and I was seven. The sun had just set, but there was light enough for our tasks. We had rhubarb leaves to gather, Rose of Sharon flowers to collect, and lightning bugs to catch. She ran back and forth with a run as cute as it was enthusiastic. I sat enthroned on an industrial wood spool and shouted orders: “Not those flowers, those are Queen Anne’s Lace!” We were storing up treasures and there was a lot of work for us to do. Well, work for her to do. Someone had to manage the operation, and if seven years had taught me nothing else, they had taught me that I loved to be the boss.\n\nMy little sister has always been game to help me achieve my goals. Whether I’m filling baskets with pink flowers or purchasing a new sofa, she’s got my back. But it’s taken me a long time to learn how to fully appreciate our relationship and not turn it into a power play.\n\nWe all have a little megalomania in us, whether we are the big sister or not. We all have an impulse to control. Henry Cloud points out that “all people were designed by God to be control freaks. But because we shy away from controlling what we are supposed to control (ourselves), we resort to controlling what we are not supposed to control (others).”\n\nOuch.\n\nWhen Paul addressed the Ephesians, he wasn’t just delivering a few tips for getting along with friends and coworkers; he was revealing how the gospel transforms all of our relationships. The gospel takes the power struggle out of the equation.\n\nOur sinful hearts are naturally inclined to rebel against authority. It’s (profoundly) hard for wives to submit to husbands, children want to rebel against parents, and who hasn’t had a hard time respecting a boss? (Ok, I know this passage also talks about slaves and masters, but I just can’t even right now with the complex issue of Old Testament slavery.) We squirm and wiggle to get out from under authority.\n\nOn the other side, our sinful hearts are inclined to control those under us. Husbands control and hurt wives, and wives undermine and control husbands. Parents try to control and micromanage their children, and employers steamroll workers all the time. We don’t want to submit, and we don’t want to lead with mercy.\n\nHere’s the good news: the gospel actually does change our relationships. It changes the nature of both our intimate and professional bonds. Yes, our sinful hearts want to control others and rebel against authority, but God only calls us to control ourselves (Galatians 5:23).\n\nHow can we control ourselves and understand this mystery of love, submission, and authority? Two ideas from scripture: Do a good job with a good heart.\n\nPaul encourages us to do a good job by enjoining us, “Don’t work only while being watched, in order to please men, but as slaves of Christ, do God’s will from your heart” (Ephesians 6:6).\n\nAnd Paul invites us to have a good heart: “Whatever you do, do it enthusiastically, as something done for the Lord and not for men, knowing that you will receive the reward of an inheritance from the Lord” (Colossians 3:23-24).\n\nBut our hearts are precisely the problem! How can I do a good job with a good heart when my  heart so bent on controlling others? The gospel never sets works before the transformed heart. It begins with Christ’s transforming work in my heart. Christ is the one who does all this.\n\nWhy does Paul go to all this trouble? To help us sort out little peccadillos with coworkers? To keep kids from getting out of hand in the grocery store? To help me not be grouchy to my husband?\n\nYeah, actually. Yes. All our relationships are about Christ. They mirror different facets of our connection to Him, so these interactions with other folks are like a training ground. We are learning to love Christ better through our relationships on earth. This mystery is profound (Ephesians 5:32).\n\nHelp your little sister when she’s gathering rhubarb, and listen to your mom if she calls you inside. God gave these people to you. When that old impulse to control strikes, use it to control yourself by submitting your heart to Christ.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nYou and I could gather around our screens and Bibles today like we were kids in Sunday school, felt board placed front and center. We’d label the felt man with his felt armor, giving each other a pep talk about putting on the full armor of God— not that shoddy, DIY armor we tend to wear. Then we’d retire to the Fellowship Hall for breakfast casserole while the choir practiced in the next room.\n\nThe conversation (and the casserole) would be worthwhile, but I’m wondering if today we might dig a little deeper into the text together.\n\nWhat is this spiritual battle Paul has us suiting up for in the first place? To find the answer, let’s hop over to Revelation 12.\n\nThe text describes a dramatic event where “the ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the one who deceives the whole world” is thrown out of heaven with all his angels (Revelation 12:12). We know how the story ends: death and Satan are conquered by perfect sacrifice of Jesus, the Lamb, on the cross (Amen!). But where is the Defeated One now? Look at Revelation 12:11-12:\n\nThey conquered him\n\nby the blood of the Lamb…\n\nTherefore rejoice, you heavens,\n\nand you who dwell in them!\n\nWoe to the earth and the sea,\n\nfor the Devil has come down to you\n\nwith great fury,\n\nbecause he knows he has a short time.\n\nPaul entreated the Ephesians to dress for battle because the battle is real and ongoing. The evil one has been defeated, but he is not going down without a fight. He lives to destroy goodness and steal the true life that only the Christ can bring (John 10:10).\n\nThis is no ordinary battle, and it calls for extraordinary armor.\n\nBut wait! Before we suit up and give it the ole college try, putting forth our very best efforts (ahem) to fight for victory, let’s remind each other of a few, very important things.\n\nFirst, the victory has already been won by Jesus. We know the outcome of this battle. Our efforts do not win the victory. Christ’s life, death, and resurrection won the victory (1 Corinthians 15:15).\n\nSecondly, you and I are not average soldiers. We are co-heirs with the Great High Priest, children of the undefeated King! The armor described by Paul in Ephesians 6:14-17 bears striking resemblance to the high priestly garb described in Exodus 28. What’s more, check out how the prophet Isaiah described the coming Messiah, our Jesus:\n\nRighteousness will be a belt around His loins;\n\nfaithfulness will be a belt around His waist.\n\n– Isaiah 11:5\n\nHe put on righteousness like a breastplate,\n\nand a helmet of salvation on His head;\n\nHe put on garments of vengeance for clothing,\n\nand He wrapped Himself in zeal as in a cloak.\n\n– Isaiah 59:17\n\nSound familiar? And, the Old Testament often describes God as a shield:\n\nAfter these events, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision:\n\nDo not be afraid, Abram.\n\nI am your shield…\n\n– Genesis 15:1a\n\nHow happy you are, Israel!\n\nWho is like you,\n\na people saved by the Lord?\n\nHe is the shield that protects you,\n\nthe sword you boast in.\n\nYour enemies will cringe before you,\n\nand you will tread on their backs.\n\n– Deuteronomy 33:29\n\nAs for the feet? The high priests donned bare feet because they stood on holy ground. And, of course, bare feet were Jesus’ jam (John 13:4-5).\n\nNow, back to Paul’s letter: he already reminded the believers of their new spiritual clothing two chapters earlier. “You took off the old self,” he said, and “you put on the new self” in Christ (Ephesians 4:22-24). He wrote it in his letter to the Romans, too: “Put on the Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 13:14).\n\nDo you see it? This armor is all His— His truth, His righteousness, His salvation, His Word. He fought the battle and won, and He laid the armor of victory on us.\n\nSo, yes— suit up today. Put that felt helmet, shield, and belt on your little felt figure. Pray earnestly at all times and “with every prayer and request,” just like Paul describes (Ephesians 6:18). Pray for boldness—not to proclaim all the answers, but to proclaim the mysterious gospel (Ephesians 6:19). \n\nIt is indeed a battle—a battle both won and ongoing—but you and I were made to fight it. Not by armor of our own making, but by the already tried and true armor of the Mighty One, our High Priest, our Messiah and King.\n\nMay our feet spread His gospel as long as we have breath.\n\n\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nNot everyone makes dinners from scratch. Nor do they set the table while singing folk songs in four-part harmony, no less. No, not everyone does these things. But the Trudeau family does. And years ago, when disease broke into their family, my friends still continued to welcome people into their home, investing great care and attention into making their space a refuge since so much of their time would be spent there due to illness. \n\nReceiving an invitation to dinner at the Trudeaus’ home is special because there are just so many things for them to juggle on an average night, let alone one with company—a warm hearth for cold bodies, hand-crafted dairy-free dressings, detoxifying herbal tea, gentle noise levels. But their home has always been a warm place because this family is the essence of hospitality. When you leave, it feels like you’ve actually been touched by grace and peace. Not merely abstract concepts on a page, grace and peace are felt in the Trudeaus’ home—as real as the gift of hospitality, evidenced by their thoughtfulness and intention, not to mention the gloriously sautéed pork chops or a round of acapella sing-a-longs.\n\nIn Paul’s letter to the Philippians, he begins by giving them something: “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (Philippians 1:2). It may seem like a simple greeting, similar to “Hello!” or “Nice to see you!” But the phrase carries more spiritual depth along with it. In Paul’s day, letters were the primary way to convey personal information from afar. It wasn’t like today, where you can text your relatives across the world or confess your love on Facebook Messenger and, best-case scenario, hear back within the hour. Because writing and sending letters required valuable commodities, there was often more intentionality behind it. \n\nPaul’s message to the believers in Philippi was even more important because his words were the closest he could get to being there with them in person. Being imprisoned, he wanted to thank this church for their financial support and faithful friendship, for being his partners in the gospel (Philippians 1:5). And after personally experiencing the grace of God and His peace that surpassed all understanding (Philippians 4:7), Paul desired for his brothers and sisters in Christ to experience these things too.\n\nWhen Paul wrote to the saints in Philippi, he extended a spiritual blessing. Both “grace” and “peace” were common salutations in Paul’s day, but he reimagined the phrase and used it to remind his readers of the gifts already imparted to them by God’s Spirit. By greeting fellow believers in this way, Paul encouraged them to remember what was theirs in Christ Jesus. \n\nMay we seize these blessings from Paul’s church greeting, remembering that grace and peace are real and active gifts that the Father gives to us through the Holy Spirit and makes accessible through His Son. They are ours today, if only we would receive them. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nEarly into this past Advent season, I wrote letters until the ring finger on my right hand blistered. For two days straight, I wrote cards of gratitude and joy for each of the volunteers in the children’s ministry I lead, followed by cards filled with stickers and sweet words for every child (ages three and over) in my ministry. In each child’s card, I wrote a variation on a similar theme, but all had the same conclusion: “I hope you always remember how much Jesus loves you.”\n\nI assume these cards were tossed aside in the holiday hubbub, or purged in the seemingly requisite January clean-out that most families undertake. As I wrote, I kept thinking, Do these words matter? Is it worth the time? Maybe the cards matter, maybe they don’t, but I know the words on them do. And every time I penned that phrase, I prayed the child who received the card would take it to heart. \n\nPaul’s letter to the Philippians starts with similar sentiments, echoing ancient truths and the hope that the words within the letter would sink down deep into the hearts of those who would read it. This opening exhortation to his readers in Philippi offers a template for godly relationships of believers deeply committed to sharing the love of Christ. Paul expressed gratitude for the Philippians, “for every remembrance” of them (Philippians 1:3), as well as their partnership in the spread of the gospel. \n\nPaul has a history with the Philippians, and it is on this rich foundation that he builds this really beautiful letter. In Acts 16, we see that when Paul first came to Philippi, a woman called Lydia was converted to faith, and then she and her family invited Paul to stay with them. Their generous hospitality was marked by open ears, open hearts, and open homes. \n\nLater in the chapter, Paul and Silas were arrested, and in the end, the Lord delivered them from prison. However, during their imprisonment, one of their jailers became a believer, and also welcomed Paul and Silas to his home: “He brought them into his house, set a meal before them, and rejoiced because he had come to believe in God with his entire household” (Acts 16:34). \n\nPaul seems to care very deeply for the Philippians. As modern readers, we know the rest of this letter will hold both caution and affection. But this beautiful opening reveals the heart and intent behind Paul’s words. We see in these verses how godly relationships work when they are anchored in love for the gospel; there is push and pull, earnest prayer, and deep care for one other’s true well-being and spiritual growth. \n\nAs I write, I see the faces of those believers who I know I can cling to with the same godly affection Paul has for the Philippians, who balance their love for me with their desire for me to grow more like Jesus every day. They aren’t afraid to whisper (or shout) rebuke in love, and they bathe their strong words in prayer for my sanctification. These people have partnered with me in the hard work of sharing the gospel with a world that has become increasingly hostile toward it. \n\nI am so thankful for these friends, and today I pray for them in the same way Paul prayed for his friends in Philippi: “that [their] love will keep on growing in knowledge and every kind of discernment,” and that they would “be pure and blameless in the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God” (Philippians 1:9–11). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nYears ago, I gave a talk about fear and anxiety. About thirty women settled into a cozy room as I began sharing some of my story. Looking back on my childhood, I see a little girl who wanted to play it safe, who perpetually problem-solved worst-case scenarios, one who felt shadowed by a vague sense of fear. This stream of anxiety ran steadily throughout my life, but no one would have known. I was the kid who easily made friends, loved school, and didn’t cause much trouble. I was the strong, steady one—until I wasn’t.\n\nIn my late twenties, in the midst of young marriage and new motherhood, the stream of anxiety became a flood. Panic attacks began to torment me. For the first time, my underground anxiety burst out and threatened to take center stage. I felt embarrassed and ashamed. I didn’t want to admit my confusing fears, and I certainly didn’t want others to see my struggle. After all, I was supposed to be the strong, steady one. \n\nAt this point in my talk, I told the women that I had a secret. I began unbuttoning my shirt. Awkward silence filled the room. Underneath my faded, denim top I wore a white t-shirt and cold, bulky metal chains. No one had suspected that I was wearing chains, yet they were there the whole time—pinching, constraining, and weighing me down. We don’t always know the chains people are wrapped up in, do we?\n\nThe apostle and missionary Paul wore chains too. In his letter to the believers in the city of Philippi, Paul explains that he is “in chains for Christ” as he endures house arrest (Philippians 1:13 NIV). For years he has been misunderstood, criticized, slandered, and beaten, and now he is jailed in Rome. \n\nSome could view Paul as a failure. Some could question his faith or even the power or goodness of God. Yet Paul is convinced that his current suffering is nothing to be ashamed of or to hide. On the contrary, he insists that his circumstances advance the gospel message. He tells the Philippians, “Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly” (Philippians 1:14 NIV). Even in jail, Paul rejoices that his guards are hearing about Jesus and that other believers are encouraged and empowered. \n\nWe may marvel at Paul’s perspective, but let’s not romanticize our chains. In 1 Corinthians 2, Paul reveals his weakness, fear, and trembling (v.3). We all chafe and wrestle with painful circumstances, those things we would never choose for ourselves, yet God still allows. \n\nWhat pinches you, constrains you, or weighs you down? Our anxieties, our fears, our sufferings are heavy and costly. But we don’t have to hide them or be ashamed. Even our struggles can deepen our dependence on Christ and point others to the one who walks us through our darkest valleys and who redeems us—chains and all. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jen Rose Yokel\n\n“So, have I missed anything during my Twitter vacation?” I asked my husband, half joking, half serious. Every January, I take an annual social media break. Whatever I call this—a fast, a disappearance, a protest, a spiritual practice, an act of self-care—I’m always astonished how the break makes my world feel quieter. It’s sobering to notice how I’m being shaped by the constant noise of life online. And I wonder how Jesus might be calling all of us to a better, humbler way.\n\nIn His letter to the church at Philippi, Paul has quite a bit to say on the subject of humility. He writes, “Consider others as more important than yourselves” (Philippians 2:3), before drawing comparisons to Jesus Himself in 2:5–7. \n\nIf this tempts you to empty yourself into silence or challenges your natural fighter instinct, please know this isn’t an invitation to be passive. Jesus was a man who frequently challenged power, debating religious leaders and touching the unclean, and defending the dignity of people on the margins of life. So no, humility isn’t about shrinking into invisibility. There are certainly things worth fighting for.\n\nPerhaps humility is more of a posture. And if humility is our posture and Christ is our example, then we can walk in love and know how to respond when we come up against the messiness of the world, acting from a place of love and security rather than reacting. We can know when to rage against the darkness and when to be still.\n\nWe can also learn when to sit and listen. We can fight the darkness while honoring each other’s humanity. We can acknowledge that even the corrupt and the cruel are loved by a God who grieves for them, who longs to lead them out of the darkness and welcome them as sons and daughters.\n\nSo, the social media thing? You don’t have to scroll far to see the human tendency to posture with pride. I see it when I ask a question and I’m already planning what to say next. I see it when my love for a person cools because I don’t like their behavior online. I see it when we slip into performative debates for the cultural currency of likes and retweets.\n\nIn life online and off, what would it look like to look out for the interests of others before my own? How might we learn to consider others with more importance, even when we disagree? What kinds of questions ought we learn to ask before we speak? And how will it empower us to know when our words really matter?\n\nQuestions like these might help to foster humility. And no doubt, we need the help because humility is a hard way. But it’s also one we don’t have to walk alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nIt was an early morning in June when I logged into my work computer at our university library. I hadn’t been online for more than a minute before seeing tributes pouring in from church leaders, moms, and others whose lives have been enriched by this one woman and her heart for God. Elisabeth Elliot had died. \n\nElisabeth’s writing helped guide my spiritual formation after I stumbled across her work somewhere around the age of twenty years old. An American missionary, wife, author, and speaker, she was a modest saint, one who would never call attention to herself. She saw our lives as “chalices” or “empty vessels willing and ready to be filled with the life of God.” But on this June morning, people seemed to think it right to honor her long walk of faithfulness. \n\nDuring his missionary journeys, the apostle Paul honored his ministry partners in a similar way by speaking well of them. When he wrote to groups like the one in Philippi, he vouched for his friends and elevated their good qualities so there would be no question of their credibility. Timothy was a “like-minded” man doing the Lord’s work with “proven character” (Philippians 2:20, 22; 1 Corinthians 16:10). Epaphroditus was his “brother” who should be welcomed with “great joy” (Philippians 2:25, 29). Paul also asked these churches to recognize and hold in high regard those among them who were risking their lives for the kingdom (1 Thessalonians 5:12–13). \n\nJesus tells us, “You will have suffering in the world.” (John 16:33). I’ve always found it strange when we describe life as having seasons of trials and tribulations. Instead of life being a static plane of serenity with intermittent times of trial, it sometimes seems that life itself is the trial with intermittent times of serenity. One thing that gives us strength while following Jesus is our friendship with others and their encouragement on the journey. \n\nI hope people pointed out the good they saw in Elisabeth Elliot while she was alive. I imagine that her modest personality was challenged now and then by opportunities to focus on affirmation from others. But even if not, I hope her story inspires us to follow Paul’s model and affirm the God-honoring qualities we see in our brothers and sisters. This isn’t to draw self-serving attention or make them arrogant; it’s an opportunity to build up the Body of Christ in a world so often marked by anything but serenity.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nWhen my husband was in business school, he had to develop an “elevator pitch” as part of his job search. An elevator pitch is a fairly standard business practice with the goal of selling something (a business idea, a person for a job, or a product) in the amount of time it takes you to ride an elevator with someone. For my husband and his fellow students, the idea was simple. At career fairs with large companies who hired the best and brightest from top business schools, you need to make yourself stand out in thirty seconds or less: say who you are, why you are different, and why you can bring unique value to the company. \n\nIn the first eleven verses of Philippians 3, Paul offers his own succinct and beautiful elevator pitch for gospel transformation. He lays it all out, right there: who he was, who he is now, and why it matters.\n\nSo who was Paul? He was the Hebrew born of Hebrews, who said of himself, “If anyone else thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I have more” (Philippians 3:4). Paul, a Pharisee whose life mission was to persecute and kill Christians, had all the right answers. He followed the law, which he knew backward and forward and to the letter. \n\nBut when confronted firsthand and face to face with the truth of who Jesus really is, Paul declared, “Everything that was a gain to me, I have considered to be a loss because of Christ” (v.7). Despite the perfect resumé, the right pedigree, the unflappable credentials—Paul had nothing to offer before God. What a radical gospel transformation Paul experienced! It’s incredible, his confidence in the gift of grace that Christ offers to us. \n\nI often feel so very lost in the darkness of my own sin. I know I have nothing to offer, despite my best efforts. But this confidence Paul describes? I don’t always believe it is available to me, too. My brain and its twisted paths of anxiety, fear, too many words and not enough faith, often lead me down the road of relying on my own flesh. I reason, I’m not good enough for God, but if I work harder, read my Bible more, pray more, be nicer to people, maybe then I’ll become more like Christ.\n\nBut here, in his eleven-verse elevator pitch for the gospel, Paul reminds me again that those thoughts are not true. My righteousness cannot come from my own flesh or from the law, but only through faith in Christ (vv.9–10). Jeremiah 9:23–24 echoes the same promise: \n\nThe wise person should not boast in his wisdom;  the strong should not boast in his strength;  the wealthy should not boast in his wealth.  But the one who boasts should boast in this:  that he understands and knows me— that I am the LORD.\n\nHe is the Lord, mighty to save and full of abounding grace. What He requires from us is a desire “to know Him and the power of His resurrection” (Philippians 3:10), a power that is available to all who receive the gospel of grace. May we remember, and always be thankful for, the privilege of being able to stand on the merit of Christ alone. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jen Rose Yokel\n\nThere’s a quote attributed to Maya Angelou that somehow gives comfort to my inner critic: “I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.” I’m not sure if these are actual words written by Dr. Angelou or if it’s one of those quotes that has been passed around so much on Instagram nobody knows the true source. But wherever it comes from, I like it. Something in it resonates with me, an echo of much-needed grace.\n\nI’d like to think this is a message someone in the church at Phillippi needed to hear when Paul’s letter came to town. In Philippians, Paul isn’t writing to correct an issue or fight a dangerous teaching. Instead, he’s sent an extended thank-you letter, a note of encouragement, and a rally to keep going.\n\nMetaphors about running races and winning prizes aren’t all that unusual in Paul’s writing, but if we look a bit more closely, we’ll find the words of a gentle, loving coach here. His letter to the Philippians includes a heartfelt thank you for their support, and the reminder that there is still so much work to do for the kingdom (Philippians 1:21–24). He points to Jesus’s obedience unto literal death as the ultimate example of humility (Philippians 2:8), a stark contradiction to his own list of credentials for “confidence in the flesh,” which is enough to make any zealous striver or recovering perfectionist wither. It’s also a false confidence Paul now recognizes as utterly empty (Philippians 3:4–6). His priorities have changed. \n\nYes, there is work. There is effort. There is a goal to pursue, a race to run, a job to do (Philippians 3:12–13). But look for the grace between the words: there is no striving in his words. Paul calls this way of thinking a mark of maturity—the realization that all we need is God. This is not the anxious striving to appease an angry Father. This is not fearfully walking on eggshells. Instead, Paul appeals to his readers’ identity as “citizens of heaven,” and encourages them to “live up to whatever truth we have [already] attained” (Philippians 1:27; 3:16).\n\nAnd so, there is the tension: to work hard for God’s purposes, but trust that Christ has taken hold of us. To embrace our identity as kingdom citizens, while knowing we won’t live this life perfectly, nor could we ever earn our way back into a right relationship with God. To be content where we are while seeking to grow, and trusting that when the time is right, the Holy Spirit will reveal truth and nudge us in the direction that will lead us to look more like Jesus. “Forgetting what is behind and reaching forward to what is ahead,” we learn to pursue the ultimate prize: Christ Jesus Himself (Philippians 3:13–14).\n\nWe grow. We learn. We know better. We do better. Until the day we step into the kingdom and the breeze on our faces feels like home.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nThe blaring siren and flashing blue lights jerked me out of my daydream. How fast was I driving, anyway? Turns out I was cruising along at 53 miles an hour in a 40-mile-an-hour zone. And it wasn’t the first time. There’s a reason my dad often told me I had “a lead foot.” This time, the police officer was firm yet gracious. He urged me to keep my speed down, but let me off with a warning instead of a costly ticket. \n\nI may sometimes be too speedy, but nothing compared to Mario Andretti, the professional racecar driver. He would regularly race at speeds over 200 miles an hour. When asked for a racing tip, he quipped, “Don’t look at the wall.” His point was that a driver’s car follows what he is focused on. Where you look is where you go. If you keep looking at the wall, you’ll crash into it.\n\nIn his letter to the church in Philippi, Paul is urging the impressionable believers to keep their focus on Christ. Paul longs for them to flourish in the faith, not to crash into walls of false teaching. In chapter 2, Paul warns the church against legalism. This deception rejected the sufficiency of Christ’s righteousness that comes from God through faith. Then and now, legalistic thinking insists that it’s a person’s best efforts and striving that make them right with God and with other people. I crash into a wall of legalism when I assume God merely tolerates me instead of remembering that He deeply delights in me as His beloved daughter. I crash when I’m critical and judge others for not meeting my personal expectations and preferences.\n\nIn chapter 3, Paul warns against another danger. While speeding away from the wall of legalism, some may over-correct and ricochet into the wall of licentiousness. This deception insists on throwing off moral restraint in hopes of satisfying all appetites and desires. “Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is their shame,” says Paul (Philippians 3:19). Licentiousness says “anything goes,” that if it feels good, you should do it. I crash into a wall of licentiousness when I pridefully believe that I’m above temptation and fail to recognize my need for God’s good boundaries. I crash when I foolishly allow my desires to drive me to do things that hurt myself and hurt others.\n\nAt the root of all legalism and licentiousness is a worship of self above all else. Paul is, in essence, warning, “Don’t look at the wall!” Where you look is where you go. When we focus on ourselves, it’s not long before we crash. But this does not need to rule us. We can stand firm in the Lord as we remember that our true citizenship, our true allegiance, is in heaven with God (Philippians 3:20). May the Lord capture our hearts and affections, enabling us to focus on Him, worshiping Him alone. The One who made us is also the only One who can save us. Only He truly satisfies our deepest longings and desires, and only He can safely lead us home.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kimberly Girard\n\nCompany was coming to town, the house was in disarray, I had mounds of laundry and cooking before me, and I was apologizing to my 10-year-old daughter for being impatient. She gave me a hug and said, “Mom, look at the things you have finished, not the things you haven’t.” In essence, the Lord was graciously reminding me, through my daughter, to “rejoice in the Lord always”—in everything—even while in the midst of a list of to-dos (Philippians 4:4). \n\nAs daughters of the King, rather than living in worry and fear, we can rejoice in “the riches of his grace that he richly poured out on us with all wisdom and understanding” (Ephesians 1:8–9). I don’t know about you, but so often, I live in and wrestle with worry. When I hear that command to rejoice, I fall into discouragement because I know my life’s not marked by rejoicing. Paul was in prison when he wrote “Rejoice!” So why can’t I rejoice where I am today? I spin my wheels trying to figure out how to cultivate a life of joy and peace. Today’s reading reminds me that the answers to how we live this life of faith are found in God’s Word. \n\nGod knows how to bring us peace because He is the God of peace (Philippians 4:9). He knows what will bring us true joy. He is always near, and so there’s no reason to worry; His peace will guard our hearts and minds (vv.5–9). \n\nWe cannot add one moment to our days by worrying, and so we are to set our minds on the Spirit, who offers us “life and peace” (Matthew 6:27; Romans 8:6). Whatever is true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, commendable—these are the things we should dwell on (Philippians 4:8). All of these things and more we are able to receive through His Spirit and His Word; He uses both to draw us to Himself.\n\nWill we continue to worry, to set our minds on things of the flesh? Yes, we may always struggle with that. But we are saved by grace, works in progress; the One who’s begun a good work in us will carry it on to completion (Philippians 1:6). And that is truly a great cause for rejoicing, because “as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us” (Psalm 103:12). Wherever we find ourselves today—even in dark seasons and in overwhelming situations—we can rest in Him and rejoice because the gospel is true.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jen Rose Yokel\n\nSome call it “liminal space,” the time or space between what has been and what lies ahead. It might be a time of waiting or even transformation. These places can be painful or beautiful: a time of singleness or the joyful, anticipated waiting during engagement. The days of longing for children or the day after the youngest leaves for college. The darkness of depression or the lifting of anxiety. In these uncertain places, how can we learn to be content?\n\nIt’s likely that Paul wrote his famous declaration of contentment from inside the walls of a Roman prison, and yet his words brim with gratitude. His friends in Philippi were concerned, doing what they could to help him, and he acknowledged that just knowing they care is enough. He tells them, “I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I find myself. I know both how to make do with little, and I know how to make do with a lot” (Philippians 4:11–12). In other words, “Thanks for your concern, but don’t worry! I’m going to be okay.”\n\nIn this letter, Paul is warm and optimistic, shifting the focus off of himself to encourage a church. His words radiate joy and humility bound up in a deep truth. Contentment doesn’t lie in comfort, and it doesn’t even lie in freedom. In this liminal space between living free or dying a brutal death, Paul shares this secret from behind bars: “I am able to do all things through Him who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13).\n\nIn our own liminal spaces, maybe we can find a little bit of that strength too. Not in a naively optimistic way that ignores or denies reality, but in a solid confidence that someday this, too—everything, really—will be made right. And in this contentment, we can take the steps we need toward the changes we desire, from making friends in a new city, to scheduling a doctor appointment, to leaning on Him to get up and take each day one step at a time.\n\nConsider the journey of a caterpillar becoming a butterfly. This old metaphor of free-flying beauty springing forth from a squirmy, leaf-munching creature can sound a little cliché. But there’s a reason this image resonates and endures. The caterpillar doesn’t just spin a little capsule and pop out fully formed. It liquifies to a death-like state. It waits. It struggles to tear out of its chrysalis, strengthening its wings so it can fly. Stop the process too soon, or attempt to help a butterfly escape, and it’s over. Every step of the process is vital. \n\nPerhaps our own waiting spaces are like that. Changing, struggling, and finding contentment in the shelter of God—over and over again, until we are made completely new. But regardless of the space we currently inhabit, whether moving forward in a joyful burst of enthusiasm or in a seemingly endless season of waiting—we are not alone. “In any and all circumstances,” we already know the secret of being content: Jesus Christ is our peace. And by His Spirit we are strengthened and equipped, enabling us to do all things.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Colossians 1:1-2, Romans 1:7, 2 Corinthians 1:1, 1 John 3:1-2\n\nThere’s a monster in my closet named Anxiety. He’s been hanging around for about five years now, long enough that his presence no longer surprises me but not quite long enough for me to predict exactly when he’ll burst out the door, let alone what it will take to put him back in.\n\nHe appeared a few days ago when my husband and I were talking about a big, vague possibility that tore my stomach in knots for reasons I couldn’t quite identify. Anxiety kicked open the closet door and came out roaring, taunting me and tossing out lies faster than I could dodge them. My husband started taking aim at those lie grenades, knocking them out of the sky, one by one. He told me true things until I started to hear them, and eventually, Anxiety went sulking back to his closet and closed the door, defeated.\n\nLies are toxic. The only sure antidote is Truth.\n\nThe people in the newly-founded church at Colossae were under fire. They were a Christ-believing, gospel-professing people in a world that refuted the basic tenets of their faith. They worshipped God in a society that worshipped angels; they believed Jesus was the Son of God in a culture that believed all flesh and matter were evil. In the midst of a lie-shouting world, the church struggled to hold fast to faith and grow in the gospel. Sound familiar?\n\nPaul, from prison, put pen to paper to speak truth into the hearts and minds of this church family he had never met, but nevertheless held close at heart. His letter to the Colossian believers is a gospel antidote—an injection of truth to counter the heresy that confronted them.\n\nTo catch Paul’s vision and heart for this short, heartfelt letter, let’s take a moment to digest the opening verses:\n\n“To the saints in Christ at Colossae…”\n\nStraightaway, Paul identifies his audience, and boldly so. The word “saints” is no haphazardly applied label— this is gospel truth! The believers at Colossae were holy and set apart before God in Christ Jesus. (And friends, if we are in Christ, this bold label applies to us too! See Romans 8:16-17.)\n\n“…who are faithful brothers.”\n\nAs he often did, Paul used familial terms to reiterate his relationship to the men and women of the church, as well as their relationship to one another. The Body of Christ is created to live and serve with one another, modeling the gospel in how we love. [And don’t let the “brothers” throw you; Paul may have addressed his letter to the men in the room, but his sentiments applied to the women too! Remember how he appealed to Euodia and Syntyche in his letter to the Philippians (Phil. 4:2-3)? Our brother Paul was mindful of his sisters. We are all one in Christ Jesus (Galatians 3:28).]\n\n“Grace to you…”\n\nIf anyone knows the boundlessness of grace, it was the apostle Paul (1 Timothy 1:15). Grace was the foundation of the Colossians’ faith—and it’s ours too. Paul consistently reminds us in his letters of this incredible truth: When it comes to grace, we can’t have too much, and we will always have enough.\n\n“…and peace from God our Father.”\n\nA prison cell is not the place you’d expect to find peace. Yet, Paul not only displayed peace, he prayed peace for his brothers and sisters. Paul knew the false teaching the Colossians were fighting, and he knew the fight was not easy. But he also knew where true peace comes from (John 14:27). As he begins this letter of bold truth and unabashed gospel teaching, Paul sends “peace from God our Father,” demonstrating his sincere love for his fellow believers.\n\nAs we prepare to read this letter together over the course of the next two weeks, let’s join Paul in pushing back the lies by giving thanks for what is true. Let’s give thanks to God for our fully undeserved, yet fully secure, standing in Christ Jesus, and for our place in this broad, beautiful family of faith. Let’s remember God’s grace, accepting a fresh dose of it anew and resting in the peace that is ours from God our Father.\n\nLet’s ask the Lord to prepare our hearts to hear the good news of the gospel once again. It is the truth that defeats all the lies, the only antidote for our ailing souls. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nMy obsession with lists runs deep. I’ve never understood how some of you can live without them. How do you keep track of all those to-dos? More importantly, how can you resist the satisfaction of making a list just to cross off all the things you’ve already accomplished?! It’s a mystery to me. \n\nLists give me a sense of structure and focus—a bit of clarity in an otherwise confusing and chaotic world. If you ask me, Paul was a list guy too. For starters, he lists all the reasons he and Timothy are thankful for the church in Colossae:\n\nThey had love for God’s people (v. 4).\n\nThey received the gospel (v. 4-5).\n\nThe gospel in them was bearing fruit in the world (v. 5).\n\nThey recognized God’s grace in the truth (v. 6).\n\nTalk about encouraging! Who doesn’t love a list like that?\n\nBut Paul’s list-making tendencies move on to an even more profound purpose: he sets the tone for the rest of his letter to the Colossians by spelling out his specific prayer for them as a church. Look at this brief but powerful list Paul prays for the Colossians in this short passage:\n\nThat they would grow in the knowledge of God (v. 10).\n\nThat they would endure by Christ’s power (v. 11).\n\nThat they would have patience by Christ’s strength (v. 11).\n\nThat they would give thanks to God the Father (v. 12).\n\nWhy does Paul ask these things for his brothers and sisters at Colossae? The answer is in verse 10: “so that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him.”\n\nWorthy. That’s a heavy word. I don’t know about you, but I have a difficult time seeing myself as worthy of lots of things, let alone the God of the universe. The harder I try to earn my worthiness, the more I seem to become aware of my shortcomings. When I rely on my own strength and strive to live worthy of my God, I fall flat on my face. Perhaps you, like me, see this calling from Paul in Colossians 1:10-12 and start looking for ways to check the boxes to worthiness. It’s difficult to turn our focus away from doing all the “right things” when it’s spelled out for us like this. It’s tangible, like our to-do lists, and we like to see our progress and accomplishments as we work through these things.\n\nBut there is only one thing that makes us worthy of the Lord: faith in Jesus. We can’t obey the call to walk worthy without remembering where our worthiness comes from.\n\nGalatians 3:13 promises this: “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law.” We no longer live under the checklist curse, having to follow every letter and check every box in order to please God. As we grow in our love for Him and our understanding of His love for us, our focus gradually shifts from our attempts at making ourselves worthy, to giving thanks for a Savior who has redeemed us and made us worthy.\n\nBefore we close our Bibles today, let’s look at one more list. In Colossians 1:12, Paul reminds us of the incredible blessings we have as followers of Christ:\n\nWe share in Christ’s inheritance.\n\nWe are rescued from darkness.\n\nWe are welcomed into Christ’s Kingdom.\n\nAnd we have received redemption from sin and death!\n\nNow, that is a list we can all get excited about. It is the list that has been fully checked off by Jesus on our behalf, and none of our shortcomings can subtract from it. May we cling to Him today, trusting that we are worthy because of His saving work in us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Debbie Eaton\n\nEvery Tuesday I meet my mentor for a walk in the woods, where a dry dirt path meanders through pine and California oak trees. Wild flowers change with the season and dry shrubbery reminds us of the drought. The path takes us to a picnic bench with a stunning backdrop of the Cleveland National Forest, majestic mountains reaching to the sky. \n\nThere we sit for an hour, in deep conversation about God. Recently our dialogue was directed by this multi-part question: Who do you believe God is? Who or what has influenced that belief? Is that belief true?\n\nIn all honesty, our conversation made me realize how easy it is to be influenced by the world’s view of God. Culture can all too easily distract and misguide us unless we know, really know, who God is by reading His Word and believing its truth (Colossians 2:7).\n\nPaul knew well the need to understand the truth of who Christ is, and he emphasized this vital truth as he evangelized and ministered the good news of redemption to others. At the time of this particular writing Paul was in prison, likely in Rome. A man named Epaphras, who is believed to be the founder and leader of the Colossian church, visited Paul and requested his help in dealing with the false teaching confronting the church. Having never been to Colossae himself, Paul wrote this compelling letter. It includes, in verses 15-20, a hymn thought to have been sung by the very early church—a statement of faith exalting the supremacy of Christ in both creation and redemption.\n\nAccording to God’s Word—and this old hymn of the church as “sung” here by Paul— this is who Christ is:\n\nHe is the image of the invisible God.\n\nHe is the firstborn over all creation.\n\nHe is the creator of everything in heaven and on earth.\n\nHe is before all things.\n\nHe is the One who holds all things together.\n\nHe is the head of the church.\n\nHe is the beginning.\n\nHe is the One in whom all the fullness of God dwells.\n\nHe is the reconciler of all things.\n\nHe is the ultimate peacemaker.\n\nTake a moment to soak in these words today. Go back and read Colossians 1:15-20, and give thanks for a Savior who is indeed all these incredible things. Read these verses silently, shout them aloud, or even sing them with joy! Ask God for fresh eyes to see the divine nature of Christ.\n\nHe is the one who created you and called you, who holds all things together even now, even today. He is the beginning and the end. He is the loving God who took on flesh and made peace with His children through the blood of His cross.\n\nPaul’s hymn of adoration is a reminder for us today that Christ is alive! He is alive and present in our world, in our community, and in us, that we may be rescued, redeemed, and resurrected in new life. Who Christ is does not change, no matter the view from where we sit today. May these beautiful words from Paul’s letter direct our hearts to worship Him.\n\n…yet for us there is one God, the Father.\n\nAll things are from Him,\n\nand we exist for Him.\n\nAnd there is one Lord, Jesus Christ.\n\nAll things are through Him,\n\nand we exist through Him.\n\n-1 Corinthians 8:6\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Vivian Mabuni\n\nSituated right near the bathroom, our side of the dorm floor drew high traffic. The sound of laughter competed with the high whizzing of the blow dryers. Bits of conversation could be overheard each time the door squeaked open. Constant commotion filled the halls, day and night.\n\nThis particular Friday afternoon an abnormal hush permeated the hallways. My roommate, like the rest of the girls on the floor, had left for the weekend. My door was left open out of habit. I paced back and forth inside the room, talking under my breath, and glanced up from my notes when I heard a knock. Kimberly, from down the hall, popped her head in and asked, “Hey! What are you doing?”\n\n“Oh, I’m just practicing for a talk I’m giving tomorrow on training people how to communicate about their relationship with God. Wanna listen and give me some feedback?”\n\nI tried not to look surprised when she nodded and plopped down on my bed. I invited all the girls on my floor to our dorm Bible study every week, but Kimberly never showed interest.\n\nI was just a young college girl, still learning the depth of the gospel, but even then I knew I played a part in a holy calling: “to make God’s message fully known” (Colossians 1:25).\n\nAs I went through the presentation, Kimberly smiled and nodded, playing the part of supportive, interested listener. I finally reached the part explaining two circle diagrams. One circle had Christ on the throne inside the life and self surrendered to Christ. The other had self on the throne and Christ outside the life.\n\n“Which circle best represents your life, Kimberly?” She pointed to the circle with Christ outside.\n\n“Which circle would you like to represent your life?” She pointed to the circle with Christ on the throne.\n\nAt that point I put down my notes. “Kimberly, really, you’ve been so great listening and paying attention and all. You don’t need to pretend about the circles.”\n\nBut Kimberly wasn’t pretending. She wanted to know Christ, and I had the joy of introducing her to Him. We talked for a bit more and then, with tears in both our eyes, we prayed together as she surrendered her life to Jesus and joined God’s family. And the hallways around the dorm floor filled with angels celebrating new life (Luke 15:10)!\n\nLike Paul, our holy calling is to make the gospel known wherever we are, to proclaim Jesus—not empty doctrine, not some moral or ethical code (Colossians 1:28, 1 Corinthians 2:2). Paul’s letter to the Colossian Christians is infused with rich language focused solely on the person and work of Jesus Christ. Note how many times “in Christ” occurs in today’s reading. In Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge (v. 2:3). We are to walk in Him (v. 2:6), be rooted and built up in Him (v. 2:7). The focus and source of life is found in Jesus.\n\nAs believers, new and seasoned alike, we have the privilege of proclaiming Christ to those around us, to help them grow in their understanding of Him. Whether the dorm floor or workplace, neighborhood or soccer field, we are placed there by God to point others to Him (Acts 17:26)! He is our holy calling.\n\nMay we faithfully proclaim Him, so that others might see Christ in us, “the hope of glory” (Colossians 1:27).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Colossians 2:8-15, Matthew 15:1-9, Romans 7:4\n\nHave you ever seen a throw pillow with something like “sticky baseboards and messy laundry means you really love your family” embroidered on it? That kind of talk really burns my buttons. I like to think there is a direct correlation between clean floors and a well-loved family. I feel this so strongly, I have tried to enforce daily cleaning chores. \n\nEVERYONE MUST CLEAN, I declare, and start drilling my six-year-olds on sanitation protocols and urging my four-year-old to truly attend to the crumbs under the chair legs. By the time the house is clean, my oldest is a griefy mess and my long-suffering husband wishes I could have just let well enough alone. I am a ridiculous Faires-Pharisee about the whole thing. (My last name is Faires. Sometimes the pun is a little too close for comfort.)\n\nWhen all is said and done, my house is very clean, doggone it. But my people are all wilted and miserable. In my passion to love my family by working together and making our home clean, I can totally miss the point of loving my family. I get all turned around and fixated on the sticky floors and the messy laundry instead of the people. Clean floors are so awesome, but in getting there, I lose sight of why we clean floors in the first place—for people.\n\nThe folks in Colossae were missing the point too. It’s so easy to do. They were fixated on checking off their boxes on their salvation to-do list. Those guys couldn’t let go of their idea of how salvation ought to be achieved—through the law. So instead of looking up from their busy law-attending to see the true freedom given through Christ, they created more and more rules for themselves.\n\nThe Colossians believed their salvation was incomplete without a little extra action on their part. In effect, they were saying, Christ did a great job and all, sure, but we still need to hustle and bustle to complete the salvation package. But this is not only exhausting, it’s heresy (Galatians 2:16).\n\nPaul said we are complete in Christ. Christ erased the certificate of debt (Colossians 2:14). We can’t erase our own debt, but Christ wiped away everyone’s outstanding balance in one fell stroke. We couldn’t pay our own debt because we were dead in our trespasses.\n\nWe can’t climb out of our own graves by trying really hard—we are dead. Jesus quotes the prophet Isaiah in Matthew 15:8 when he reminds us:\n\n“These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”\n\nWhat simultaneous censure and freedom is found in these words! Don’t worry, Christ has already fulfilled the law for you. So keep your britches on and don’t go out and create your own pseudo rules for salvation.\n\nTherefore, my brothers, you also were put to death in relation to the law through the crucified body of the Messiah, so that you may belong to another—to Him who was raised from the dead—that we may bear fruit for God.\n\n– Romans 7:4\n\nGimme that embroidered on a pillow!\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sarah Matheny\n\nText: Colossians 2:16-23, Romans 14:1-23, Hebrews 8:1-6, Hebrews 10:1-10\n\nI’ve heard it takes 21 days to make a new habit stick. In theory, after three weeks of going through the paces, whatever habit you’re trying to adopt will finally stick. The shadow of who you want to be, in 21 days, will have been fully eclipsed by a new, truer you—a sugar quitter, a regular exerciser, or one of those responsible individuals who skips the Netflix binge-watching and goes to bed early. In theory.\n\nThe tricky part—which anyone attempting such goals will tell you—is getting through those 21 days without quitting. Keep in mind, this is coming from the woman who has twice caved during 30-day sugar detoxes to cookie dough ice cream and peanut butter cups (days 8 and 11, respectively).\n\nIn an effort to maintain consistency, we easily-tempted humans utilize all sorts of “self-help” tools of various rules and rituals, not to mention accountability via hashtags online, social media check-ins, wellness apps, and maybe even real live community groups. While these things can be useful in getting us closer to our goal, we also run the risk of making them our sole and supreme focus.\n\nThough Paul certainly isn’t referring to quitting sugar in these words to the Colossians, he is speaking to the danger of being so lost in religion and ritual and how-tos that we never truly taste the goodness of God. He is preaching against asceticism, a severe, man-imposed self-discipline that serves as self-serving checkmarks rather than true submission to God (Colossians 2:22-23).\n\nPaul feared Christians in Colossae were becoming more occupied with these acts of “merit” than with the living Christ Himself.\n\nFriends, don’t we do our own version of these empty acts today? Take my daughter, for example, making “breakfast” in her play kitchen and then gnawing on a plastic waffle. Are we tasting the real thing or just going through the paces? Are we doing spiritual things because they’re “good,” or are we doing them out of love for Christ?\n\nThese “virtuous” disciplines, as Paul writes, are simply a shadow. The substance is Jesus (Colossians 2:7). When we buy into these practices apart from the person of Christ, we undervalue God’s grace, presuming that He needs our righteousness. He doesn’t. Christ is perfectly righteous, and we can only find our fullness in Him. In love, He calls us to live in a way that is good and holy and right—not out of fear of losing our salvation, but out of our adoration of Him.  \n\nA full life in Jesus doesn’t mean 21 days of going through the paces, making a prideful display of spiritual acts we think will make us more holy. We can’t be satisfied with the shadow, not when we have the Savior. The gospel offers real fullness in Christ, freely given. And believe me, friends, nothing tastes sweeter (Psalm 119:103-104).\n\n",

I’m sitting in my bedroom writing this morning, and it looks like a bomb went off in here. I have yet to unpack from three different trips we’ve taken this month, the laundry basket was long ago lost under the mountain of dirty clothes that have piled up, and my desk is littered with mail I haven’t read, invitations I haven’t RSVP’d to, and about 30-50 post-it notes my two- year-old drew on yesterday while she was “working.”\n\nThe state of my bedroom matches the state of my heart. It’s a mess in there. I’m looking at a “to-do” list of things left undone and the mess around me, and all the lies are coming. “You are terrible at life. You’re worthless. You can’t get anything right.” I feel stressed, anxious, overwhelmed, and sleep-deprived, and looking at the state of my heart and my bedroom makes my shoulders tight. I am also grieving some brokenness in the lives of dear friends, and the weight of it all feels like too much this morning.\n\nWhen I’m overwhelmed like this, I revert back to my old friends Shame and Fear, and the company they keep with me is terrible. But then I read this:\n\nSet your minds on what is above, not on what is on the earth.\n\n– Colossians 3:2\n\nAnd I’m reminded of something my pastor told us a few years ago: “For every look you take at yourself, take ten looks at Jesus.”\n\nI remember practicing this years ago with our small group. We would sit around and share what life was throwing at us, and for each struggle, we would move our eyes together from the trial to the cross—to the promises God has given and the life He’s called us to live. The practice was and is transformative.\n\nThis morning, as I turn my mind from the mess both around and inside of me to the face of Jesus, something is shifting. I’m remembering His love and how He covers me even when I make a mess of things (Colossians 3:3). I’m remembering that He is a God who is not afraid of our messes but who enters right into the middle of them.\n\nI’m remembering that I am no longer a slave to sin (Romans 6:6), and that He’s called me to something better. I may struggle with the same junk over and over again, but each time I struggle is an opportunity to draw near to Jesus. Each struggle is an opportunity to put off the old self and take hold of that which Jesus has already taken hold of for me (Colossians 3:5-11, Philippians 3:12).\n\nToday I’m sitting here in this room, remembering that you and I have a beautiful invitation to a new life in Christ. As we put off all our sin, we get to put on His love—and His love looks good on everybody (Colossians 3:12-14)! I’m remembering that I get to choose how I think. I can choose to let the “peace of the Messiah” control my heart rather than fear and shame. And I can choose to be thankful, even when life breaks my heart and doesn’t turn out like I wish it would. In light of what Jesus has done for all of us on the cross, there is always a reason for thanksgiving.\n\nMost of all, I’m remembering that I am “dearly loved,” and that changes everything (Colossians 3:12). So sisters, instead of just focusing on ourselves today—on what we’ve done or left undone, on how we ache, or on how we wish things were different than they are— let’s turn our eyes, over and over again, to the One who knows and loves us best.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Alyssa Joy Bethke\n\nText: Colossians 3:18-4:1, Matthew 6:33, Ephesians 5:22-6:9\n\nIt’s been a rough week in the Bethke household.\n\nMy husband has had some extremely long work days, and we’ve hardly seen him. Then he got sick. Then I got sick. And now we’re packing to leave home for a month, baby girl in tow.\n\nI’m overwhelmed. I feel drained and in need of a break. And if I’m completely honest with you, which I’d like to be, today I have had a terrible attitude. The inside of my heart looks a little like this:\n\nBut I’m exhausted too! Can’t I have a nap? Can’t someone make ME soup? I know somebody has to keep the ship sailing, but why does it always have to be meeeee?\n\nTerrible, right?!\n\nBut, do you know what? God knows my heart, even on my terrible days. He knows your heart too. And He knows relationships are messy because, the fact is, we’re messy. And so, through Paul’s letter, the Father gently lays out Colossians 3 for us, telling us what actions to put off and what actions to put on. Then, in Colossians 3:18-4:1, Paul gets into the nitty gritty of certain relationships. Husbands and wives. Parents and children. Masters and slaves. (We get the distinct sense this list of two-party relationships could go on.)\n\nHe sums up these diverse relationships with this:\n\nWhatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.\n\n-Colossians 3:23-24\n\nRelationships can be tough for everyone. We feel forgotten, misunderstood, and underappreciated. We try hard to please and we get caught up in comparisons. We can feel brought down, discouraged, frustrated, angry—we can feel a lot of things.\n\nBut in the quiet, the Lord whispers to us, My child, I know you. And I love you. Do all that you do, FOR ME (Psalm 139:1, Romans 8:38-39, Colossians 3:23).\n\nWhen we take our eye off Jesus, we put them onto ourselves and those around us. But true love, hope, and joy don’t come from ourselves or others—they come from our Savior! We can find joy in difficult moments, relationships, and circumstances because God is the only One we need to please, and we can rest in His unending love and grace. We don’t have to earn His love; He freely is pouring it out on us every moment of every day (Romans 5:5).\n\nMy friend, you are not forgotten. You are seen (Psalm 139:2).\n\nYou are not underappreciated. You are greatly rejoiced over (Zephaniah 3:17).\n\nYou are understood. God made you who you are (Psalm 139:13-14).\n\nThe gospel should be the fuel of all our relationships, in the joyful moments and the tough moments. The messy moments will happen but, like us, they are not beyond Christ’s redemptive reach. When we keep our eyes on Jesus— remembering that He is the one we serve when we love others— the perspective and attitudes of our hearts will be laced with the grace of Christ.\n\nMay we do all things for Him and for Him alone.\n\n“But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you.”\n\n-Matthew 6:33\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Colossians 4:2-6, Psalm 145:18-19, Philippians 4:6-7, Matthew 5:16\n\nIf you want to experience heartache and hope in the same breath, read the “Missed Connections” section of Craigslist.\n\nThis regret-ridden virtual message board, similar to a milk carton ad for “missing persons,” contains the pleas of locals who cannot shake the weight of a missed opportunity. They lay awake at night, deciding that if different words (or words at all, for that matter) had been spoken to the girl across the room or the boy at the bus stop, they would be together frolicking in daffodils, tasting wedding cakes, or binge-watching Netflix. (A girl can dream, right?)\n\nA few years ago, I might have been tempted to post my own message to that guy across the crowded room:\n\nTo the boy in my favorite coffee shop who asked if I was a football fan,\n\nI said no because I was trying to play it cool. I’ve never missed a game.\n\nAlso, I just found out you happen to be our new quarterback. Let’s get married.\n\nIt’s just so embarrassing to feel misunderstood, isn’t it? But even worse, we can’t leave it alone. Our unquenchable need to be seen and heard curls its fists, marching backward and demanding another chance to be acknowledged. Vowing to only curate attractive qualities and pleasing viewpoints from then on, we rest assured people will treasure our perspectives forever. They don’t.\n\nAnd yet it is our clumsy, shaky voices that are chosen to communicate something so precious: the gospel. This call is so high and so important that I immediately fear it. If my words are jumbled and my speech begins to stutter, can I cause someone to bypass an encounter with Christ?\n\nAs Paul wraps up his letter to the Colossians, he addresses these concerns, advising them to “act wisely toward outsiders, making the most of the time” (Colossians 4:5). He continues, “Your speech should always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should answer each person” (Colossians 4:6).\n\nBefore our insecurities rise again, let’s focus in on the interesting way Paul uses the word “salt” here, because it changes everything. Friends, he’s talking about grace! Our job is simply to allow others to taste the salt of grace. We are side-by-side consumers of God’s provision, sharing plates with those around us.\n\nSalt causes thirst. God’s Word doesn’t need our PR efforts. Its mere mention causes sin to salivate for grace. Our job is not to concoct our own savory presentation of the gospel; every ingredient was chosen to feed our own innate hunger. Instead, our task is to speak words from our personal thirst, pointing to the source of Living Water (John 7:37-39).\n\nSalt is a preservative. Grace goes before and behind us, allowing even our faultiest efforts to proclaim His glory. Because of this, we don’t need to focus on results and reactions, but on the surety of God’s control. We can share generously and graciously from a sound-minded spirit.\n\nGod does not need us to share the good news, but He chooses us as His vessels of grace. As sharers of the gospel, our job description is less about defending our stance and more about gluing our eyes to His posture.\n\nMay the salt of grace season all of our encounters today, and may we be thankful for our God who never misses a connection. Amen. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Final Greetings",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Colossians 4:7-18, Romans 15:30-33, Philippians 1:3-7\n\nI like to think of the final greetings in Paul’s letters as the “say hello to your mother for me” section. He opens with his typical “grace and peace,” follows with some thanksgiving and prayer, then gets down to business. By the end, he often zeroes in on some very specific housekeeping matters before he closes.\n\nHave you noticed this pattern, too?\n\nGrace & peace.\n\nI’m thankful for you. I pray for you.\n\nDo not forsake the true-true-true gospel.\n\nBut really, don’t forget what being a Christ follower means and what it doesn’t mean.\n\nBe good to each other.\n\nSay hi to so-and-so for me. (Or, put more accurately: When you bump into these people, listen to what they say and take care of them. Oh, and this person says hello!)\n\nAlso, this really is me sending this note. (Paul often dictated his letters, then signed them with his own hand at the end.)\n\nIt’s the housekeeping piece at the end that, though often overlooked, contains some of the most interesting little details of Paul’s letters. He’s naming names. Arranging meetings. Making sure people are looking out for each other. He’s caring for the church as a whole—the body of Christ.\n\nFor fun (and because there is always something to learn!), let’s take a closer look at the people Paul mentions. What is so important about these folks, anyway?\n\nTychicus was a native of Asia Minor who delivered this letter to Colossae, as well as the letter to the church in Ephesus and Paul’s personal letter to Philemon. (Isn’t it so cool that God used Tychicus as a courier for some of the most important mail in Christendom?)\n\nOnesimus may be my personal favorite. He was Philemon’s slave, but when he escaped to Rome he met Paul and then Jesus. (The book of Philemon is a super-quick, super-compelling letter from Paul to Philemon, calling in a big favor: he asks Philemon to take Onesimus back, not as a slave, but as a brother in Christ.)\n\nAristarchus was from Thessalonica. He joined Paul on his journey and gave his life and freedom so that others may know Christ.\n\nMark actually had a bit of a reputation because he bailed on Paul early on, which caused a falling out between Paul and Barnabas (Acts 13:13, 15:39). As Mark matured spiritually, he returned to work alongside Paul, who instructed the church to welcome Mark back.\n\nEpaphras was from Colossae, too. Colossians 4:12 says he “contended” for the Church in his prayers. The Greek word for “contend” here means “to fight for.” (Isn’t it good to remember that one of the best ways we can fight for Christ’s church is by praying for her?)\n\nLuke was, of course, the author of the Gospel that bears his name, as well as the book of Acts. It seems Luke stayed with Paul throughout his imprisonment, aiding in the ministry of the gospel.\n\nDemas has sort of a bummer of a story. He deserted Paul because “he loved this present world” (2 Timothy 4:10). (Man, I hate how painfully close-to-home Demas’ two-second story feels.)\n\nNympha was a Christian woman who had a lot of money and hosted the church in her home. She gave what she had for the gospel.\n\nFinally, Paul charges Archippus (possibly the son of Philemon) to pay attention to the ministry he has received in the Lord, so that he may accomplish it (Colossians 4:17).\n\nYou guys. That is a lot of people. None of them were perfect, yet Paul intentionally and affectionately included them by name in his letter. Among this web of individuals and cities, there was a lot of brokenness, disappointment, and even betrayal.\n\nDoes it help you to see that the church then looked a lot like the church does today? It was full of flawed people who needed to forgive and be forgiven. They forgot the true gospel was for them and for each other. There was real hurt and genuine restoration.\n\nAs we close out this series of letters from Paul to the early church, let’s pay attention to how wildly relevant even his final greetings are to us as the church today.\n\nRestoration among believers is still possible.\n\nFighting for the church sometimes just means praying for her.\n\nThe temptation to love this present world isn’t a new one.\n\nAnd best of all? The truth of the gospel hasn’t budged one bit.\n\nIt was true for Paul and his friends then. And it is true for you and for me today. Thanks be to God!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Acts 16:1-40, Acts 17:1-34, Acts 18:1-5\n\nEditor’s note:\n\nThe Scripture reading for today is longer than the others and comes from the book of Acts. These chapters in Acts provide context for our study of 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and give us a foundation for understanding the Apostle Paul’s relationship with this church.\n\nMy grandmother had five siblings, and by the time I came along, the six had married to become twelve. I grew up around their vegetable and flower gardens, in their kitchens that smelled of soup beans and cornbread. I listened to them tell stories late into the night, sat by as they played cards amid uproarious laughter, even stood outside in my pajamas after dark as they howled old songs by the light of the moon.\n\nI rarely think of one of them without thinking of all of them. In my mind they were a set—always connected. That’s not to say they were always together over the years. They saw wars and endured moves and raised children in different states. But when life separated them, they built bridges with letters. They wrote letters home from overseas, sent postcards when they traveled, mailed handwritten pages of updates from one address to the other.  Even now that only two of the twelve remain, they write letters to us, their family. They keep us connected still. \n\nLetters encourage in a way email never will. They speak to a part of the soul that social media comments can’t quite reach. When I read the letters from the Apostle Paul to the church at Thessalonica, I hear the earnestness of words written by hand and carried on foot. I hear a weary pastor, a brother in the faith, longing to see his congregation—his family. \n\nToday’s Scripture reading gives us context for our study of the letters of 1 and 2 Thessalonians. Acts 16 and 17 tell how Paul visited Thessalonica on his second missionary journey—a journey that included many other cities and countless trials along the way. The apostle faithfully preached the gospel to anyone in earshot, and they ran him out of nearly every town he dared enter. But Paul’s work was not in vain because the Holy Spirit was at work. Families of faith formed along his route—one of them in Thessalonica.\n\n Paul’s letters to the Thessalonian believers are like so many of his other letters, filled with instruction on how to live the Christian life. But these letters do more than clarify theology; they are filled to the brim with affection and encouragement for the men and women whose belief in and hunger for the gospel encouraged him, their teacher. Paul wrote to build up his Thessalonian faith family, not with empty platitudes, but with a hope rooted one truth: “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah” (Acts 17:3). \n\nAs you walk through 1 and 2 Thessalonians in the coming weeks, read with a heart for the present and an eye to the future. We are here on this earth for a time, connected as sisters and brothers in the faith. But we are only here for a time. The greatest encouragement we have to offer one another is the hope of Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 1:1-10, Romans 8:35-39, 1 Peter 4:12-14\n\n“I would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought, and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.”\n\n– G. K. Chesterton\n\nI went to a high school with clean carpets, new lockers, and teachers who cared. Whenever adults mentioned the school and its shiny gymnasium floors, they would say, “We’re so blessed to have this facility.” Our teachers would smile as they paraded us to the library full of new books: “We’re so blessed to have this facility.”\n\nIt became a joke, at least between my sister and me, who were still learning the ropes of gratefulness. We’d lounge on the beautifully upholstered purple furniture, looking at original paintings of eagles hung on the walls while chanting to each other in our best Michigan-mom accents, “We’re so blessed to have this facility.”\n\nSomehow, blessedly, we moved from lying around, idly kicking at our backpacks, to being contributing members of that community, and our hearts moved from mockery to genuine thankfulness for the incredible, undeserved blessings in our lives.\n\nIf we can consider Chesterton’s words that the highest form of thought is thankfulness, then ungrateful mockery is possibly the lowest form of thought. Paul is setting the example for his beloved Thessalonians by weaving his thankfulness throughout this letter to them. And he doesn’t just thank them for doing a great job; he thanks God for all the saving benefits bestowed on them, and celebrates the evidence of the gospel in their lives (1 Thessalonians 1:2-5). His thanks are, above all, to God. \n\nAll good comes from God, so no good can be hoped for by sinners but from God. Paul’s thanks to God are appropriate because God is the author of all that is good—not just all the good that comes to us, but even all the good that is done by us.\n\nI think of myself as a pretty thankful person—maybe you do, too—but I hadn’t thought of it as a duty. Matthew Henry goes so far as to say, “Thanksgiving to God is a great duty, to be performed always or constantly; even when we do not actually give thanks to God by our words, we should have a grateful sense of God’s goodness upon our minds.” We are to set our minds always in the gear of gratefulness.\n\nDo you find yourself in a habit of gratefulness to God, or are you set in mockery? When I consider the percentages of the words that come out of my mouth, I’m definitely teasing or complaining at least as much as I’m blessing and thanking.\n\nIf you also find yourself struck by the mockery and ungratefulness that escapes your lips and hangs around your mind, you’re in good company. But don’t just grit your teeth and try harder. Paul immediately points us to the three cardinal graces: faith, hope, and love. And he doesn’t say, “Try harder, y’all! Get you some more faith, hope, and love!” Instead he names the cause of these graces: our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nAll good comes from Him, and any change in our hearts comes from Him. He is the object and also the instigator of our thankfulness. For the gospel also comes to us not only in words, but in power (1 Thessalonians 1:5).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 2:1-20, 1 Corinthians 9:3-14, Hebrews 4:12\n\nI send more emails every day than I can count, but there’s one that brings me an inordinate amount of joy. It’s not work-related, requires many pop culture references, and has low standards for correct grammar. Any questions as to why it’s my favorite? \n\nYou see, a few years ago, I was sitting at my desk at a new job when an email popped up from a name I recognized, yet hadn’t talked to in quite some time. “LONG LOST FRIEND” was in the subject line, and the unnecessary capitalization has become our own kind of necessary in the hundreds of emails that have been sent and received since. \n\nWhat started out as a lighthearted attempt for two girlfriends to catch up over lunch breaks and between meetings became a regular rhythm in my day, and eventually, the sweetest lifeline. This email chain connected two very different lives: one single and dating, and the other newly married; one in Tennessee and the other in Mississippi. But despite our different seasons of life, both of us needed encouragement, typed-out prayers, and echoes of “me too” in ways we couldn’t before describe. \n\nPaul’s letter to the Thessalonians puts words to why the silly emails between my friend and me aren’t so silly after all: God created our lives to be shared. When the Thessalonians read Paul’s words for the first time, I like to imagine them getting the same silly grin I do when an email pops up from my modern-day pen pal. Paul was their guy! He understood them! Thessalonica was going through their own share of suffering and affliction, but this letter was filled with gospel truths—the motivation they needed to help them endure. \n\nPaul’s letter illustrates that being a family of faith involves knowing and being known. His writing assumes a prior two-way relationship, one that repeats phrases like “for you yourselves know” and “as you know.” Closeness in community is vital for any gospel-centered relationship—in ministry, in suffering, and everything in between. But this closeness is not merely circumstantial or emotional; it is rooted in truth and grown in grace.\n\nOne of the best ways to receive and offer encouragement in community is through God’s Word. Paul knew the importance of communicating the truth about Jesus, mentioning Him by name in every single chapter of 1 Thessalonians. As sisters in Christ, we too ought to permanently carry the gospel of hope on our tongues. \n\nGod gives us pieces of His own love when He gives us friendship with one another. Whether with a faraway friend via email or a coworker over coffee, we get to witness redemption, encourage growth, and partake in God’s goodness when we share with others “not only the gospel of God but also our own lives” (1 Thessalonians 2:8). Thanks be to God.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Wynter Pitts\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 3:1-13, Matthew 4:1-11, Romans 8:16-21\n\nI enjoy being alone. If I’m honest, I should go ahead and admit that it’s actually one of my favorite things to do. After a busy weekend or a house full of activity, I long for a quiet space, large window, soft blanket, and a cup of hot goodness. This is my happy place, and I could stay there for what seems like forever. I am especially prone to long for my alone time when my outward circumstances weigh heavily on my brain and my heart longs for an escape. \n\n I often joke that I just want to sleep it—whatever “it” may be—off. In my ideal world, when things are not going my way, when suffering comes and danger knocks on my door, I simply want to retreat, disappear, and not return until all is well again. And I’d prefer to do this alone.\n\nThough being alone provides a much-needed space to quiet the noise and refocus my thoughts, something dangerous can happen when I retreat to my happy place in order to avoid the discomforts of my reality.  I create an open space for fear to grow, an inviting environment for lies to build and pain to settle in. It becomes easy to lose sight of truth, and I inevitably pull further and further away from Christ. \n\nI know that it is during these times especially that I need to pray and intentionally focus my attention on God’s Word. But can I be honest? In the midst of suffering, this becomes harder and harder to do alone. \n\nIt is during these exact times that I am grateful for my community—friends who will not sit back and watch me sink, but instead will selflessly show up at my door and sit with me. Sometimes they come carrying a load of their own, and our prayers for each become what we both need in order to stand. Whether I want to admit it or not, it is the presence and prayers of others that help keep me secure.\n\nThere is danger in suffering alone. But Christ knew this about us; therefore, He has called us to care for, love, and support those around us regardless of our own personal discomforts. He uses our pain, our circumstances, and stories to grow us in both love for Him and for His kingdom. Paul said it this way to the Thessalonians: \n\n“So we have been greatly encouraged in the midst of our troubles and suffering, dear brothers and sisters, because you have remained strong in your faith.”\n\n– 1 Thessalonians 3:7\n\nClearly, Paul does not avoid the topic of suffering. He knows it all too well. However, he also knows that his ability to love, encourage, and pray for the people around him is directly connected to his dependence on Christ. \n\nWhen relying on our personal strength to stand, we will surely fall. However, Christ calls us to trust in Him in all circumstances. It is only the outpouring of His love that strengthens us to stand, and encourage those around us. Thanks be to God who knows us better than we know ourselves, and gave us the gift of community. “And may the Lord cause [us] to increase and overflow with love for one another and for everyone” (1 Thessalonians 3:12).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 4:1-12, Ezekiel 36:26-27, 1 Peter 1:15-23\n\nThe word “holiness” is one of those terms that, depending on your background, can carry a lot of baggage. For some of us, it’s connected to feelings of guilt and shame, an impossible standard hanging over us. Others associate it with harshness and judgment after hearing it taught legalistically.\n\nAt first blush, 1 Thessalonians 4 might seem to play into these stereotypes by linking holiness with sexual morality. Paul exhorts the Thessalonians toward holiness by cautioning them from indulging in “lustful desires” (v. 5), and instead encouraging them to “control their own bodies.” Just another Christian prude, our present-day culture might think. However, there is more going on here than first meets the eye.\n\nFirst is the Thessalonian culture, which is remarkably similar to our own. Many New Testament scholars note that the pagan Thessalonian culture had a liberal view of sexuality. Sex outside the bounds of marriage was not only permissible, but even encouraged.\n\nThe second thing to note about this passage is the tone. It’s tempting to read instructions about holiness in a thundering voice of condemnation, but that was not Paul’s approach. In verse 1, the Greek word erotao—translated “entreat” or “encourage”—has a connotation of gentleness and friendship. Paul isn’t dropping a hammer of judgment; instead, he is clarifying and affirming a community he loves. \n\nPaul can see the Thessalonians are living their faith well. They are honoring Christ with their lifestyles. They are pursuing holiness in every area of their lives. But as they continue to do so, Paul wants them to make a distinction between the teachings of their culture and the teachings of Christ, which diverge on the issue of sexual practice. \n\nThis context matters, especially in light of popular stereotypes about Christian holiness and sex. For Paul, holiness is not a measuring stick we should use to compare and condemn. By its reckoning, we all fall short.\n\nInstead, holiness is our witness. It’s how we point the world to the character of God and proclaim, “This is what God’s love is like.” God’s love is intimate and invested. It is constant and covenantal. It is dignifying rather than degrading. It does not use and abuse. It does not take advantage for a short-lived thrill. It isn’t rooted in selfish desire but self-giving faithfulness. Our holy lives bear witness to all these things.\n\nIn that sense, holiness is not simply about being different or set apart, but reinvigorating the imagination of a world which misunderstands both God and sex. Rather than sneer at our culture and its sexual norms, we can humbly and joyfully point to something better. Our holy lives can serve as the embodiment of God’s best for humanity, a vision of freedom, honor, and dignity.\n\nHoliness was never meant to be a spiritual bludgeon. And it is much more than a set of boundaries and rules. It is our witness to a world that has forgotten how to live. It is our witness to a world that has forgotten what we are for. And it is our witness to a world that has forgotten what God is like.\n\nEverything about us—our bodies, our sex—is a part of that witness. We, the people of God, exist to point people to God. Love is His song, and holiness is the dance.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, 1 Thessalonians 5:1-11, Joel 2:31-32, 1 Corinthians 15:42-49\n\nGod keeps His promises.\n\nIt’s an indisputable fact that no one can keep promises better than God. I will not be persuaded otherwise, and neither should you. After repeatedly attempting to achieve lifelong happiness by setting my hope on the promises of friends, boyfriends, or family members, and then finding myself picking up the pieces of my broken heart after the carpet got yanked out from under me each time, I finally can speak this truth: There ain’t nobody NOWHERE that can keep a promise like God can! \n\nAllow me to elaborate.\n\nIn 1 Thessalonians 4, Paul encourages believers not to grieve hopelessly when fellow Christians die.  Grieving like there is no hope is what the world does, not what Christians do. Paul isn’t trying to be callous here—of course there is room to grieve when a loved one dies. He’s using that example as a way to illuminate a substantial promise from God: Life in this world is only the beginning.\n\nHere’s the thing: the same power (God’s power) that raised Christ from the dead is taking up active residence in every believer. God’s power transforms us from those who were once walking in darkness into children of glorious light. This illuminating power enables us to lead lives of godliness and holiness— teaching, correcting, convicting, guiding, and comforting us. And it is that very same power that gives God’s people strength and peace in their dying hour. \n\nBut God’s power doesn’t stop working there. Today’s reading promises that His power is working even after death, resurrecting believers into life eternal. This is the great hope: when this life has been lived, we get to spend eternity in paradise! Paul urges his audience to build up fellow weary believers with the truth of this promise.\n\nIn today’s decidedly postmodern, secularist world, the idea of spending an eternity in paradise seems pretty far-fetched. We’re taught to trust what we can see and can be proven with tangible evidence. But as citizens of the kingdom of God, we’re instructed to trust One that we can’t see or touch. How do we do that? Well, it takes faith. But not blind faith—informed faith. We need faith that relies on what we already know to be true about God and His promises. Here’s a small pool of evidence:\n\nGod promises Abraham that He would make him a great nation… Check!\n\nGod promises to deliver the children of Israel from slavery in Egypt… Done!\n\nGod promises to send a Messiah… Yep!\n\nGod promises to send the Holy Spirit… Again, check!\n\nEven with just a few examples, it’s plain for us to see that God promises big, but He always delivers. Even if no one else in our world can keep a promise, God can. But listen, don’t keep this good word to yourself!  “Encourage one another with these words” (1 Thessalonians 4:18). Let another sister know that when we’re tossed around by the broken promises of others, or when it seems that we’re just spinning our wheels in this life of faith, we’ve got to remember this promise from God: This life is only the beginning.\n\nAnd you can take that to the bank.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 5:12-28, 2 Chronicles 31:4-10, Ephesians 4:11-16\n\nWhat is God’s will for my life?\n\nOh, the anxious hours I’ve spent with this question on repeat, searching for a spiritual formula to solve life’s riddles. My college years especially were a mishmash of trusting the Lord with newfound abandon yet agonizing over every decision. What am I supposed to study? Am I supposed to go on this mission trip or that one? Should I break up with this boy? Should we get back together?\n\nThe weight of my young world balanced precariously on so many question marks. Sometimes it still does.\n\nThe uncertainties I’ve faced in each phase of life have felt big and I’ve felt small, like life is the sum of a million puzzles, most of them missing a piece (or ten). But as the years pass and draw me closer to the Lord, a surprising truth has become clear: God’s will is not a problem to be solved.\n\nGod’s Word tells me His faithfulness does not depend on my wisdom (Lamentations 3:22-24).\n\nGod’s Word tells me His grace does not depend on my performance (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n\nGod’s Word tells me that no matter what shape my life takes, His steadfastness and goodness trump whatever is going on around me (Psalm 136).\n\nFriends, our circumstances are big, but our God is bigger. And as we learn to trust the bigness of our God and the sureness of His sovereignty, we find that His will is not just a path—it is also a way of walking.\n\nIn his letter to the church at Thessalonica, Paul reduces all our agonizing life questions to a non-formula so simple it makes the perfectionists among us a little crazy:\n\n“Rejoice always,\n\npray constantly,\n\ngive thanks in everything;\n\nfor this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.”\n\n-1 Thessalonians 5:16-18\n\nNo hoops to jump through. No tests to pass. No situational tidiness required. Only actively resting in our God.\n\nWhy an active resting? Because rejoicing is not a passive pursuit. Thanksgiving is not an emotion. We are to declare God’s goodness in every circumstance. We are to let the world know what He has done and what He is doing. We are to pray to Him, seek Him, give Him thanks with an expectant, joyful heart. This is God’s will for us in Jesus.\n\nThere are heartaches among us today. So many question marks, so much waiting, so many puzzles missing a piece. And with so much confusion surrounding us in this world, Paul tells us to “test all things” with the help of the Holy Spirit, and then to cling to what’s true and “hold on to what is good” (v. 21). And we know this: In everything, our God is good. \n\nGod’s love for you is steadfast, no matter the path you’re walking. His promises hold even when your world is crumbling. It is not up to you to be the god of your circumstances. It is for you to give thanks to the One who is greater than any circumstance you will ever face.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Thessalonians 1:1-12, Isaiah 66:15-16, Romans 8:30\n\nI am more of the abundant grace mindset, that all my sins, infractions, and struggles are covered by the spread of the gospel’s cloak. The idea that I must be made worthy of my calling as a child of God rubs raw against me. I don’t like it, if I’m honest. I know my soul, my sins, the weights that so easily entangle me and my proclivity for veering off the seemingly impossible bullseye of perfection. I will not be found worthy. I will be found wanting. \n\nIt seems I am always looking for loopholes in my Christian life. I am by nature lazy and despise boundaries and constraints unless they’re of my own making. I look for ways out and around and over or under, but rarely through because through is hard—and I don’t like hard. This is why I like the abundant grace theology: I can fail hard all my life, kick against the pleasant boundaries God has set for me, and I’m still in.\n\nThis is what Dietrich Bonhoeffer called cheap grace—dependance on a cosmic cloak with nothing of form beneath it: “Forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline. Communion without confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ.” When I make the gospel simply about grace and not about the specific work of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I have cheapened the work. It becomes another form of godlessness. All about me, my performance, and an automatic pass regardless. \n\nPaul, in 2 Thessalonians, gives me the perfect “gospel catch-22.” I am caught up in a story written before the foundation of time that was written by God and not my own worthiness or sense of it. “To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power” (1:11, emphasis mine). Whose calling? Not mine, His. Whose power? Not mine, His. So whose work is this staying worthy? His work by His hand. I cannot wriggle out of this work even if I tried. I am caught in an endless loop of His calling and His power. Caught. Stayed. All in. \n\nThere are ways we usurp the gospel’s full work in us, by neglecting to acknowledge the One whose work all this is. It is His power to will and work in us, and any power we might have is a mere shadow, a substanceless trick of the light. He compels and pursues us, He guards us and guides us, He protects us and provides for us, He completes the work of salvation by the power of the Spirit, through the work of the Son and under the care of the Father. This work is by and for and with and about Him—not us. Even my wriggling out of the careful and pleasant boundaries He has laid for me point to His calling and His power (Psalm 16:5-6). \n\nWhere are you omitting God from the gospel today? How are you making it simply about grace and your own work? Where are you forgetting the wonderful catch-22 loop you’re bound by and set free within? His calling, His work, and by His power. This grace is not cheap; you were bought with a price (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). But this grace is also entirely free—by the work and hand of God—for you.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Thessalonians 2:1-17, Daniel 11:36-37, Matthew 24:30-31\n\nI’m not sure who began the rumor, but somebody did. Somebody in the church at Thessalonica whispered to somebody else that the Day of the Lord had come, and panic began to spread. \n\nPerhaps this person saw evil happening around him and drew his own conclusions. Perhaps someone misinterpreted Paul’s first letter that described Jesus’ Second Coming to be a warning that the Second Coming was upon her. We don’t know, but from the way Paul addressed the issue, we do know that this rumor caused anxiety. \n\nPaul pleaded with the church,  “We ask you, brothers, not to be easily upset in mind or troubled, either by a spirit or by a message or by a letter as if from us, alleging the Day of the Lord has come. Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way” (2 Thessalonians 2:1-3). \n\nPaul’s strategy to dispel this rumor was to fight it with the truth. Referencing a visit recorded in Acts 17:1-13, he asks: “Don’t you remember that when I was still with you I told you about this?” (2 Thessalonians 2:5). He then details the events they had gone over together in Scripture, the events that would precede the End Times, how Christ would prevail over the evil one, and how all of this would happen under the sovereignty of God’s timing. \n\nIn their state of confusion, Paul used the truth to reassure the church. The truth can do the same for us. What rumors do we fall prey to? What causes us to feel fear or to panic? \n\nIt is not only rumors about the End Times that can upset us. It can be rumors about other aspects of our faith. Rumors about people we know. Rumors about people we don’t know. Rumors are so dangerous because beyond misleading people with falsities, they cause unnecessary fear and anxiety. They cause us to trust the story rather than our God. Or, they cause us to judge others based on what we’ve heard about them, rather than what God says about them.\n\nThough rumors may be impossible to avoid, especially in our social-media-driven culture, they are not impossible to dispute. As Christ followers, we are also truth followers, and as truth followers we should also be truth seekers. The ones who—before buying into the rumor—ask ourselves, as Paul did with the Thessalonians: \n\nWhat is the truth here?\n\nWhat does Scripture really say about this?\n\nWhere is the Holy Spirit guiding me on this topic, or this story?\n\nIn this way, we will not be deceived. \n\nRumors cause shadows of confusion, but the truth exposes lies to the light. Rumors cause fear and panic, but the truth brings freedom and peace. Rather than adding to the rumor mill, may we be the ones who put a stop to it with truth—a truth that says God loves us and has given us eternal encouragement and good hope by grace. Now that is a story we can trust in.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Thessalonians 3:1-18,  2 Corinthians 11:7-9, 1 Peter 5:8-11\n\nI try not to follow ambulances, rubber neck at traffic accidents, or stare when someone drops a whole bag of marbles on the ground. But when something goes terribly wrong, somehow we all want to turn our heads to watch. I think it comes from twin desires to help, but also to gawk.\n\nA few years ago, my then eight-year-old daughter and I walked into the food court of our local mall. There we found ourselves pushed to the front of a crowd that must have been nearing 100 people. They were encircling a lifeless boy on the floor, who looked to be no more than two years old. Together, we stood helpless, looking on while EMTs performed CPR on his little body.\n\nI don’t know a lot about medicine, but I do know you only implement CPR if there is no pulse or breathing. It’s our way of manually keeping a body going. Since that was already being done, there was really nothing left for the other 100 of us to do.\n\nAnd so we all stood still and watched. His mother didn’t cry; she paced, she moaned, she shouted. We felt powerless to help the child or his mother. It was shocking to see so many people standing there, hands at their sides, while the battle between life and death was fought right in front of us.\n\nIt’s awful to face our own powerlessness. I like to really lean my shoulder into a job and then promptly see a result for my effort. But when it comes down to it, when things are really important, I’m like that crowd of people, rendered helpless, left watching and waiting.\n\nIn 2 Thessalonians 3:5, Paul prays, “may the Lord direct your hearts to God’s love and Christ’s endurance.” The whole Christian walk is one of dependance. The air we breathe, the gravity that holds us to the earth, and the ability to wonder at it—it all comes from God’s common grace. We have no endurance apart from the endurance of Christ. \n\nMoments of calamity and tragedy unveil our deep neediness and utter helplessness. They direct us to our only strength and recourse, which is Christ. And it is only by His strength that we will not grow weary in in our faith and in doing good in the name of the gospel (2 Thessalonians 3:13).\n\nWhen we saw the baby and his mother in crisis, I took my little girl by the hand and led her around the corner where we found a quiet spot to pray. But even our prayers are a recognition of our enormous need. Prayer is not about what we do, but about running to the God who can do all things. It is an avenue for God to impart His love and endurance to us. \n\nWhat a tremendous grace this is, to know the God who loves perfectly and to be in relationship with the God who endures endlessly. In the face of our overwhelming sorrows, He directs our hearts back to Him. His is the real strength in our ever-present weakness. \n\nThe God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, establish, strengthen, and support you after you have suffered a little while. To him be dominion forever. Amen.\n\n—1 Peter 5:10-11\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessica Lamb\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Timothy 1:1-11, Psalm 119:1-7, Acts 16:1-5\n\nMy maiden name was regularly mistaken for a similarly spelled, but distinctly different, last name. People confused the two enough that my father, brother, and I often answered to the wrong name without much thought. My mother, though, never let the wrong name slide. She’d politely smile and correct every person, sometimes more than once, who added an unnecessary “r” to the pronunciation of our last name. Though it was only part of her name by marriage, she fiercely defended its integrity. \n\nWhat remains fascinating to me about this common mistake is how often people disagreed with her correction, telling her the way they misunderstood our name was, in fact, more accurate. It was as if their opinion of what our last name ought to be was more important than what our name truly is. Persistent as they were, they could not change the truth. \n\nThe fight for preserving what is true is at the heart of today’s reading, and of 1 Timothy as a whole. Paul wrote to Timothy, his coworker and protégé, to encourage him to guard the heritage of the Christian faith—a faith that was being challenged by false teaching and a skewed understanding of what it meant to be a follower of Jesus. \n\nIn Acts 16, we catch a glimpse of how Paul’s mentorship of Timothy began. Timothy left his family to travel with Paul on his second missionary journey, sharing the gospel and establishing the early Church. He became one of Paul’s most trusted disciples and coworkers, ministering alongside Paul as he wrote much of the New Testament. Paul wrote this first letter to Timothy while the young protégé was serving as pastor to the church in Ephesus. \n\nWe see the depth of their relationship in how Paul addresses Timothy. More than just a coworker, Timothy is Paul’s “true son in the faith” (1:2).  That affectionate reference is, in part, a reminder to Timothy that he, and all believers, are part of a spiritual heritage. When we come to faith in Jesus, we become part of the family of God (1 John 3:1-2). In this family, part of our ministry is to guard the lineage of our faith by remembering what it means to be a believer and then passing those truths down to future generations. \n\nThe believers Timothy pastored were distracted by empty speculations and false doctrine. We have to guard against the same—whether in our own hearts, in our own conversations, or in how we teach others about our faith through our words and actions. \n\nGod Himself is the best authority on our faith. His Word isn’t a list of meaningless rules; it is light in the darkness, a lamp that shows us where to place our feet as we live lives faithful and true to the heritage of the gospel. When we keep our focus on growing in affection for God and His Word, we stay true to our pursuit of love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith. \n\nJessica Scoggins (not Scroggins) Lamb consumes books, tea, and street-style tacos with equal ferocity.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Timothy 1:12-20, Acts 8:1-3, Acts 9:1-22\n\nI never wanted to join the circus. And yet, here I am, breathlessly perched on the tightrope of terrified obedience. It’s that narrow road we’re called to walk as followers of Christ. The stakes get higher when our faith in Christ compels us to go and to do, to serve and to minister, knowing we don’t have what it takes to do so on our own. \n\nAs we read Paul’s words in 1 Timothy, we can squint our eyes and see him walking on the tightrope ahead of us. As he describes his qualifications for ministry, it’s clear Paul knows how unqualified he truly is. \n\nIt was Paul, after all, who approved the persecution of Stephen. That event was the spark that ignited a raging fire of persecution among God’s people. While the Church wept and wailed, “Saul… was ravaging the church. He would enter house after house, drag off men and women, and put them in prison” (Acts 8:3). \n\nPut that on your Bible college application.  \n\nBased on Saul’s resume, there’s not a single one of us who would pick him to teach the gospel, encourage the saints, plant churches, spearhead missionary journeys, and appoint church leaders. And yet, God Himself described Saul (a.k.a. Paul) as His “chosen instrument” (Acts 9:15). \n\nThis is the seemingly upside down way of our sovereign God. He never calls us into kingdom work because we are the most fit, the most prepared, the most gifted, or the most popular. He doesn’t ask us to do things that we could easily do in our own strength and power. \n\nInstead, He invites us out onto that tightrope where we know we aren’t qualified, where we must trust His Spirit for every step. A life of ministry and obedience can feel scary because we know we cannot grit our teeth and do what is required on our own. We aren’t capable of reaching a lost and dying world or serving selflessly in our own strength. We can’t generate enough elbow grease to produce faithfulness on our own. Our resumés are just good kindling in God’s economy. \n\nThat reality can paralyze us. And yet, when human eyes only saw Saul’s failures, God looked at him and saw future faithfulness:\n\n“I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord who has strengthened me, because he considered me faithful, appointing me to the ministry” (1 Timothy 1:12). \n\nWhile we tend to evaluate our qualifications based on what we see in the rearview mirror, only God is able to see our forward faithfulness. In His sovereignty, He knew that Saul was too weak and sinful to surrender and serve, but He also saw the coming tsunami of grace that would sweep Saul away from his rebellion. \n\nThe next time you look at the ways God calls you to live, love, and serve, thinking “I can’t do this,” know that you’re right. We can’t walk the narrow road on our own. May the gospel steady our feet as with eyes on Jesus we dare to take the next step toward future faithfulness.\n\n",

I glanced at 1 Timothy 2 and read the last few verses and my stomach sunk. This chapter has been hotly debated by theologians far more versed than I in the original languages, in historical context, and in all kinds of study. How can I possibly add to the conversation? \n\nTo write about 1 Timothy 2 for a community of women who will all have some sort of pain or story or lens through which they read this chapter feels too daunting for me. But then my eyes catch the last words of it: “continue in faith, love, and holiness, with good sense” (v. 15). What does it mean, first, for me to honor and obey these words before I think of communicating them to others? Chiefly it means to exercise self-control and read from the beginning. My eyes moved back up the page to these words: \n\n“First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone, for kings and all those who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. This is good, and it pleases God our Savior, who wants everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth” (vv. 1-4).\n\n“First of all, then… ” \n\nThere is an order to these words. Paul wants to communicate something to Timothy: that all people in all places need “petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings” made on their behalf, and in doing so it leads to a “tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity” (v. 1). It gives dignity to all people everywhere when we pray for them, thank God for them, and intercede on their behalf. \n\nIt seems to me the enemy’s best ploy is to steal our dignity, our quietness, and our peace by disordering our reading. Enticing us to lack self-control and skip passages, cherry-picking the most difficult or most beautiful to meet whatever need we have in ourselves or see in culture. But to live quietly, peacefully, and with dignity, we must read in order and, in some ways, do in order. \n\nBefore we argue about hotly debated subjects, do we first dignify one another by praying, interceding, and giving thanks for each other? Are we first people of peace by offering supplication (the action of asking or begging for something earnestly or humbly) on behalf of their personhood, character, story, theology, and personality? Are we primarily people of quietness, trusting that it is God who changes hearts and minds and stories—not us? \n\nThere is so much division in our world today. One needs only a cursory glance at the news to know brokenness abounds. But it’s not just in culture; it’s in the Church, too—this passage is a prime example of passages that divide instead of unite. How, then, can we be people who first pray before debate, who first intercede before we interject, and who first give thanks before we theologize? \n\nThis morning, as I write, I want to stay in the first few verses of 1 Timothy chapter 2 before I move further down in the passage. I want to learn to pray with this kind of open-handedness to the God of the universe on behalf of all people everywhere. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Mystery of Godliness",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Timothy 3:1-16, Romans 9:15-24\n\nThe hymn “In Christ Alone” has been my church’s unofficial anthem for several years now. I say “anthem” because whenever the worship leader begins to play the familiar chords, the energy in the room changes. Everyone’s attention seems to become more focused, both forward and upward. People stand without prompting, and by the end of the song, we’re all sort of yell-singing our favorite line: “Up from the grave He rose again!” We are declaring in this anthem what we believe. We’re reminding each other of what’s true, and the power of this is tangible in the room.\n\nPerhaps this is why Paul slipped a hymn into his instructions for Timothy. “The mystery of godliness is great,” he says in 1 Timothy 3:16. He then explains what that mystery is by using lines from what some scholars believe was a popular hymn of his time.\n\n“He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory” (v. 16).\n\nThey are the basic tenets of Christianity—truths Timothy knew well. Paul understood our human tendency to forget the truth and simply begin to follow a religion or set of rules for the sake of following something. Using the power of an anthem—his “In Christ Alone,” shall we say—Paul reminds Timothy of the gospel before diving into further spiritual instruction. We need the same thing. \n\nThere’s a method to our godliness, and it’s crucial to understand the reason behind what we do and Who we live for if we’re going to stand strong in our faith.\n\nIn almost the same breath that he declares the mystery of godliness, Paul also delivers a warning to Timothy, saying that in later times there will be false teachers, deceitful spirits, and many who depart from the faith (1 Timothy 4:1-2).\n\nPaul was right. Heresy, deceit, and hypocrisy are not only things of the future; they are rampant in our world now. Knowing, understanding, and believing the mystery of godliness—the gospel of Jesus Christ—is more crucial than ever. Without God’s truth as our anchor, we will float from here to there with each person who enters our lives touting a new philosophy or theology (James 1:6). But with our anthem close to our hearts, we remember who Jesus is and we can distinguish His truth from the lies.\n\nJust as Paul did in his letter to Timothy, we must remember and remind one another of what is true. We declare our anthem to one another again and again, “giving thanks always for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Ephesians 5:19-20).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Timothy 4:1-16, Ecclesiastes 9:7-9, Colossians 2:16-23\n\nFlossing is the elephant in the room when it comes to dental hygiene. It’s right there, we all know we should be attending to it, but few of us are hitting the bullseye.\n\nWhen I first draw out the fresh clean length of floss, all’s fair. As the glistening rope is shimmied between rows of teeth, its usefulness preserves its privilege to be allowed access to my mouth. But the second the act of flossing is over, the string of floss immediately shifts from valued instrument to absolute and unequivocal garbage. Once I’ve finished flossing and set the floss down for even a second, there is no circumstance that could persuade me to take that floss up again and begin the process afresh. Something in my brain tells me that once the floss has left my hands, it’s no longer something useful—now it’s appalling and gross.\n\nArbitrary rules like this usually stem from an important kernel of truth, ranging from harmless to helpful, and even downright quirky. Some people won’t let one food touch another. Others mandate that the proper orientation of toilet paper is out instead of in. But we stray into dangerous territory when we position our cute, quirky opinions as moral law. Paul is writing to Timothy about this precise problem.\n\nFolks at the church in Ephesus had gotten carried away with their opinions, and instead of sticking to the simple truth of Scripture, they added their own rules and declared these as essentials of the Christian faith. Rather than commending them for adding more strictness to the law, Paul condemns these extra rules, reminding them that creation is good. These additions are actually a departure from the faith. Legalism is a natural bent of the human heart. We adore making up our own rules and setting up our opinions as law. Our inclination toward rulemaking is as strong in matters of faith as it is in dental hygiene. But we are not called to simply follow rules; we are called to pursue the living Christ.\n\nPaul encourages us to train ourselves in godliness. God gave us the law to train our sinful hearts. In Paul’s letter to the Galatians, he calls the law our tutor: “Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith” (Galatians 3:24). We need training wheels to point our hearts in the right direction. We need guidance to orient our lives in the ways of grace. God laid out tracks for us to follow, and as we learn to wobble in His ways, we start to think like Him—start to act more like Him. We find we are no longer focused on the rules, but running after the Father with all our might.\n\nThe leaders of Ephesus were getting it all backwards; they were focused on things with limited benefit. But Christ invites us to Himself, for He is beneficial in every way (1 Timothy 4:8). They couldn’t see the forest for trees—or anything important because they were fighting over whether or not they should eat ham. We can’t lead others to Christ when we aren’t seeking Him ourselves. \n\n Look to Christ. Run to Him. “For this reason we labor and strive, because we have put our hope in the living God” (v. 10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Timothy 5:1-6:2a, Matthew 18:15-20, 1 Corinthians 7:39-40\n\nIt was my first time driving in a funeral processional. I’d always been a passenger, not the driver. But on this day I was in the car alone, hazard lights flashing, trusting the cars in front of me to lead me safely to the funeral home. A couple dozen cars drove along, speeding up and slowing down in unnatural rhythm, trying our best to keep too much space from forming between each car in the line. A police officer in a black sedan with flashing lights would block an intersection until some of us passed, and then he’d speed up, siren blazing, to beat the lead car to the next intersection.\n\nThe last stretch of the drive took us down a busy four-lane highway where we came to a stop, assumedly due to afternoon Nashville traffic. But the cause of the delay soon showed itself: two long lines of cars had parted, moving to either side of the road and stopping in silent, reverent lines, waiting for us to pass. I felt like an Israelite driving through the Red Sea on dry ground, passageway granted by a supernatural turn of events. Maybe that sounds melodramatic, but in a world where we daily insist on our own truth and our own way, the gesture struck me as an unlikely bastion of decency in an individualistic society. The last shall be first. Those who mourn shall be comforted. It was the gospel in everyday clothes.\n\nIn our reading today, Timothy, a young pastor of a young church, was learning to lead his congregation in caring for one another. Paul, an older, more experienced brother in the faith, was writing to bolster Timothy’s faith and offer some practical advice. The headline of this particular part of his letter? Support and honor. \n\nThese are actions most of us agree to in theory. Support those in need; honor one another as fellow image-bearers of God. Those who do not know Jesus recognize these concepts too, even if they call them by a different name. It’s the reason the line of cars didn’t plow over the police officer that day and insist on their right to the road: we recognize there is a “right” thing to do. The problem comes in moving from theory to practice; we might agree that supporting those in need is good and important, but exactly who is “in need” and how to support them—there’s the rub. \n\nThe first two verses of today’s reading set the crucial premise for the detailed, context-specific instructions Paul gave Timothy on the subject: “Don’t rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers, older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters with all purity” (1 Timothy 5:1-2). Fathers, brothers, mothers, sisters. In other words, regard your fellow church members as family and act toward them accordingly. \n\nThe Church—the family of God—is to care for one another in love and sincerity. We are to move past good intentions and into action, even though it means risking tension, disagreement, and misunderstanding. If we are indeed family, then we can work it out together, forgiving our imperfections and ignorance along the way, gently helping one another grow in the ways of truth and love as imitators of Christ. And if we are followers of Christ and co-laborers in His gospel, then His reputation, not ours, is what is ultimately at stake. \n\nAs a family who knows the life-changing, life-giving grace of Jesus, may the countercultural support and honor we show one another cause the world to stop and wonder: Who taught them to love like this?   \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Timothy 6:2-21, Psalm 90:1-17, Matthew 27:11-14\n\nI have the gift of always ordering the right thing off the menu. Most of the time, I just look at my husband and ask, “Do you just want me to order for us?” (In truth, it’s more of a statement, than a question.) And 99% of the time, I end up with the best dish. \n\nBut that other 1% of the time, I end up disappointed and usually blame what I consider to be an erroneous menu description, perhaps one that highlighted the wrong ingredient. Or maybe I’d assumed that something would be roasted and instead is raw—that sort of thing. \n\nWhen reality doesn’t measure up to our expectations (whether it’s a movie we’ve been wanting to see, a meal at a fancy restaurant, or a blossoming relationship), it can be devastating. Paul is warning the church at Ephesus about this very thing: false teaching leads to bad fruit. And he is calling on Timothy to guard the truth, the legacy of the faith.\n\nPaul chides those who claim to speak the gospel but believe that “godliness is a way to material gain” (1 Timothy 6:5). He lists signposts of their wayward focus: envy, quarreling, slander, evil suspicions, constant disagreement. He warns Timothy, but then he takes it a step further.\n\nPaul’s warning is not passive. This passage is full of strong action words that charge Timothy and his congregation with the weighty responsibility of representing the faith. John MacArthur wrote that this passage outlines what a man of God should be known for—“by what he flees from, follows after, fights for, and is faithful to.” \n\nAnd what is the north star for this calling, for our calling as Christians? What is the standard to which we should evaluate the things, people, and ideas we flee from, follow, fight for, and are faithful to? What tells us what we should guard? Scripture, that’s what. \n\nWhen Paul uses the word “guard” in verse 20, he uses the Greek word phylassō, which appears approximately 30 times throughout the Bible. Jesus used it when He said, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it” (Luke 11:28).\n\nWe represent the Word of God. We image God Himself. We are mirrors, reflecting the beauty of Christ out into the world. And Paul dares us to do so with integrity to the faith as written in the Holy Word.  \n\nIn a sermon on this passage, Ligon Duncan said: \n\n“Paul calls on Timothy and his congregation, and us, to retain the truth, to hold fast to it; to refrain from dabbling in worldly speculation and false teaching; to realize that false teaching will lead sheep over the edge into destruction; and to be utterly dependent, as we hold fast to that truth, on the only thing that can hold us up, which is the grace of God.”\n\nThanks be to God that we have such a steadfast anchor in the person of Christ and in the Word. And in a world marked by postmodernism, swaying between “your truth” and “my truth” and, so often, no truth at all, I pray that we will lean on the Father’s grace as we guard the heritage of our faith.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Timothy 1:1-18, 2 Corinthians 3:4-6, 1 Thessalonians 5:16-22\n\nThe exact details of the story have faded in my memory. I’m not sure where I heard it or the name of the man at the center of the narrative. I don’t need to know his name to want to be just like him. \n\nHis story goes something like this… \n\nChristians were gathered in a home church in a country where worshiping Jesus was strictly forbidden. Authorities raided the home, forcing the terrified worshipers to lie on the floor, then brutally beat anyone who dared to resist. Despite this violence, they could not stop the man; he was determined to rise. \n\nOver and over, he simply stood up silently, squared his shoulders, and looked his attackers in the eye. He was beaten back down each time only to rise to his feet again. He did not fight. He did not argue. He simply stood, no matter how bloody and bruised he became. Eventually, his attackers relented. Like Paul’s words to Timothy—penned despite imprisonments, beatings, abandonments, and trials—this man’s faith could not be shaken. He would not be kept down. \n\nI may never face the butt of a gun as a result of my faith in Jesus. I may never know Paul’s fate of repeated imprisonment for declaring the gospel. The stakes may not look as dramatic, but we all know how it feels to be beaten down in some way or another. We feel the pressure to play it safe and be quiet about Jesus. But we cannot. Over and over and over, we must continue to rise. We must.\n\nPaul’s powerful words echo throughout time, to the Church in every era. Whatever obstacles we face in culture or in the parthenon of public opinion, whatever makes our knees buckle, whatever threatens to silence us, or makes us want to simply lay low—when we weigh them against the heavy weight of the gospel, the scales are easily tipped. \n\nWe must speak out.\n\nWe must live boldly.\n\nWe must rise.\n\nFear cannot become our default. Let us remind each other often that we are a people uniquely armed with power and love and self-control (2 Timothy 1:7). Through the silent testimony of our sold-out lives and words seasoned with grace, we must declare, “But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me” (v. 12). \n\nWhat inspired Paul to declare the gospel so boldly? He refused to forget the stench of the prison of sin he had been delivered from. Every other cell smelled like freedom. He remembered how it felt to be buried by the weight of his own sin, but through Jesus, he had been invited to rise and walk a new life. \n\nPaul’s declaration to Timothy, and our declaration to each other is this: I am not ashamed of the gospel, because the gospel is not ashamed of me. Church, we do not deserve such extravagant grace. We are a ragamuffin bunch called to reach the world with radical truth. \n\nThere will always be opposition. Even so, let us rise. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Timothy 2:1-13, Romans 6:5-10, 1 Corinthians 15:3-8\n\nTwo weeks into my first year teaching history at a private school in Nashville, the Latin teacher stopped at my door. He was tall and round about the middle, with short hair, deep eyes and a soft-spoken voice that carried kindness on every syllable. His oldest daughter was in my class, and when he asked if I wanted to share lunch at the picnic tables, I hesitated. Life had taught me to suspect older men, to assume their intentions were nefarious. But Ben Ellis just wanted to share turkey sandwiches and talk about history. Trying my hand at trust, I said yes.\n\nOver the next year, Ben made a habit of stopping at my door, checking in, dropping off history resources and pep talks in equal measure. His wife and five children became regulars at our dinner table; my husband and I at theirs. Ben was one of the first people to encourage me in my writing, buying a copy of the crappy short story I wrote about birds and pretending not to notice the typos. \n\nAnd then everything changed. Esophageal cancer invaded his body. Soon, he was no longer round about the middle. Soon, he was no longer teaching. \n\nDuring his months of treatment—even up until the last days on earth—Ben enjoyed singing hymns, in particular a call-and-response song that goes like this: \n\n I am bound, (I am bound)\n\nI am bound, (I am bound)\n\nI am bound for the Promised Land.\n\nIt was true of him, and it is no less true of me. We are bound for another place. But it’s important to remember that the word “bound” has many different meanings.\n\nOf course, “bound” can mean you are headed somewhere, and we are headed for eternity with God. Jesus promises that He is preparing a place for us, so that we can be with Him forever in that place. We can be confident in that promise because Jesus’ resurrection was not a fairy-tale. It was a historical event verified by more than 500 witnesses (1 Corinthians 15:6). Because Jesus destroyed death, death no longer determines our final destination.\n\nBound can also mean shackled, as in, bound in chains. On earth, we are certainly entangled with suffering. Paul tells Timothy not to shy away from that truth. He reminds Timothy that our temporary struggle is like that of a soldier, an athlete, or a farmer—people who sacrifice willingly, trusting that their efforts will reap a later reward. But as Christians, our reward is not a prize or a harvest. Our reward is not a change in our circumstances, or the healing of our cancers. Our reward is the person of Jesus Christ. We are bound, yes, but we are bound for something. We are bound for Him. \n\nPaul was bound for the Promised Land too. He was literally shackled—his only connection to the outside world, his pen. And he proclaimed the gospel loudly, disregarding that his message almost certainly would lead to his execution.\n\nBut in all the ways we are bound, God is not bound. While we are moving toward heaven, He is unhindered by time and space. While we are limited by our lack of resources, depleted energy, and grief at the suffering all around us, He does not grow weary. His Word is at work in the world—everywhere, always. And that is great news.\n\nAs I consider the limitations on my life, the suffering I wish was over, I cling to God’s promise. Though I am weak, He is strong. Though I am bound, He is already here.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Timothy 2:14-26, Galatians 5:22-25, 1 Peter 3:14-16\n\nWords have the power to heal or destroy. “Sharper than a knife,” we say. When a simple turn of phrase has cut you, you know what I’m talking about.\n\nI’m not prone to physical violence. If anything, I avoid it at all costs. But if I’m truthful, which is the whole point here, I can’t begin to count the times I’ve wounded another with careless syllables, intentionally and unintentionally. I imagine I’m not alone in this.\n\nWhen Paul urges Timothy in his second letter to warn believers to “avoid irreverent and empty speech” (2 Timothy 2:16) he is talking about more than petty gossip. This letter, written shortly before Paul’s death, focuses on the importance of teaching God’s inspired Word correctly. If all words hold incredible life-giving and death-bringing power, imagine how the divine Word of God can alter a life. Sadly, Christians have been known to twist and abuse the Word of God far too often. This was a problem Paul addressed around AD 67, and it’s a problem that still plagues our communities today.\n\nI’m sure we can all call to mind a person in our day and age we might consider a heretic or false teacher. While it’s natural to want to defend the faith, and guard the hearts and minds of others, Paul’s teaching directs us to check our own mouths first. \n\nPaul cautions Christians not to fight about words or get caught up in quarrels over small matters of interpretation. Now, I’ve known many people who enjoy arguing about theology. While there can be productive debate among believers and instances when we must call out false teachings, often these squabbles turn into a hypocritical and discouraging witness. \n\nThe trouble comes when we start preaching about things we don’t understand, or building walls around beliefs that Christ never promoted. Traveling down that road, we can become a hindrance to the faith of others. As Paul put it, you can actually lead to the “ruin of those who listen” (v. 14). Yikes! Now that is something I definitely don’t want to be guilty of! \n\nAs women in the Word, God will hold us accountable for our stewardship of this precious gift of faith. It’s a great responsibility to wield the most potent Word in all of humankind; as the Gospel of Luke says, “From everyone who has been given much, much will be required” (12:48). \n\nWhen we stand before our Lord, we will want to stand “as one approved, a worker who doesn’t need to be ashamed, correctly teaching the word of truth” (2 Timothy 2:15). In order to do that, we must be careful how we speak about holy things. We need not be afraid to share our faith, but we should do so “with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience” (1 Peter 3:16).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Timothy 3:1-17, Exodus 7:8-13, John 15:18-21\n\nTrials are the anvil on which our faith is formed, and yet it is within those trials that we need more faith. Often times, the thing we need most desperately in the midst of trial is the thing still yet unformed in some ways. How, then, is the Christian to prepare for difficulties? How do we prepare for the moments when “evil people and imposters go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived” (2 Timothy 3:13)? I know in those moments I’m most desperate for the lifeboat of a proven faith and not a thing that feels feeble, unfinished, or in process. I want bedrock and my faith feels like it rests on sinking sand. \n\nPaul tells Timothy that the answer for how to “continue in what you have learned and firmly believed”—even though it is still being formed—is in “knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus” (vv. 14-15).\n\nThe answer to a robust faith in the midst of trials is meditation upon Scripture, shoring up our belief, our faith, and our certainty that God is both good Himself and doing good in all our situations. These words of life are able to make us “wise for salvation, through faith in Christ Jesus” (v. 15). This is an astounding promise and a perfect guarantee. Scripture never returns to us void. It always produces the fruit of righteousness: wisdom through faith in Jesus. Not wisdom in our own ability to get through trials or wisdom in proven methods of success. Wisdom through faith in Jesus. \n\nWhen we believe Jesus is who He says He is and will do what He says He will do, our faith is bolstered and we are reminded of the hope within us. Apart from Christ Jesus, we can continue in nothing. Apart from faith centered in Him, we can continue in nothing. Apart from wisdom through faith in Him, we can continue in nothing. Apart from Scriptures from which wisdom is gained through faith in Him, we can continue in nothing. And so, in a beautiful full circle, apart from God giving us Scriptures from which wisdom is gained through faith in Him, we can continue in nothing. Everything begins and ends with Jesus, sweet Jesus. \n\nHow do we continue in what we have learned and firmly believe? Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Every day in every way. If trials are the anvil on which our faith is formed, Christ is the hammer and the fire and the blacksmith, and the finished thing is more perfect and beautiful for it all.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Timothy 4:1-22, Deuteronomy 31:6-8, 1 Corinthians 9:24-27\n\nI’ve run exactly one marathon—actually, a half marathon. It was the winter of 2012, a mild winter, and most mornings, I could survive my five-mile training run with no more than leggings, a long-sleeved shirt, and a hat to keep the wind off my ears. The online guide I’d printed out for first-timers alternated short runs with longer ones, and as I checked the calendar, I realized I was about to hit a new milestone: six miles. I’d never run that far in my life. Every time I passed the five-mile marker, I started walking. That was enough right? Why go further?\n\nMy mind told my limbs that it was too hard, too boring. And so I stopped. Nashville has a renowned running club, which offered half-marathon training, and I knew if I had any chance at hitting my goal, I needed help.\n\nThe following Sunday morning, I showed up to the running club, amazed that there were so many, like me, who needed the help of others. A short Indian man led my pace pack, and when I fell out (at mile five, again) he fell back with me, using his watch to push me to run for a minute, walk for a minute, until my body overpowered my mind. Within a few weeks, I was running seven miles, then ten. And though I was slow, I persisted. \n\nRunning is such an easy metaphor because it is so applicable to our life as Christians. Living a life of self-control and faith can leave us asking, “Why?” What’s the point of waiting until marriage, when there’s so much romance and sex to be had now? What’s the point of trusting in God, when things aren’t going the way you’d planned anyway? What’s the point of staying married, when the days blend together, one never-ending drone of laundry to wash, messes to clean, and cooking to complete? The mundane rhythms of a faithful life are like the pain of a solitary run—one foot after another, breathing, willing yourself not to stop, or to be diverted to another path. It’s not easy, and most of the time, it’s not fun. But it is worth it. \n\nPaul tells Timothy not to grow discouraged in his particular race. Persist, he says, whether it is convenient or not. In fact, I’d venture to say that persistence is most evident when it’s not convenient. When life gets boring and painful, like a long and solitary run, we are so quick to turn for relief, for permission to stop, for a detour. We itch to hear some new truth that indulges our desire for comfort. But our comfort isn’t in the race ending; our comfort comes in the form of great partners, running at our side. \n\nFor a while, Timothy had Paul by his side, like my friend in the running club, offering advice, encouraging him onward. But Paul knew his race was nearly finished. As death lingers in the near future, Paul tells Timothy that he will have to go on alone. But even alone, we are not alone. Paul tells him, “Everyone deserted me, but the Lord stood with me” (2 Timothy 4:16).\n\nI do not know what particular race this day holds for you. This month. This year. Perhaps you are staring at the uphill climb of divorce, a valley of infertility, or the flat plains of our mundane world. Run, my friend. Run slow, if you have to. Enjoy your Christian running mates, if and when they are there. And when they are gone, run, knowing that Jesus is by your side.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Titus 1:1-16, Ephesians 4:11-13, Hebrews 6:13-20 \n\nHave you ever worked under poor leadership? Sadly, most of us have had a run-in with a bad boss or two. If you have ever worked for someone you couldn’t trust, respect, or follow, you know how frustrating and even hurtful those experiences can be. \n\nThankfully, I have had the experience of working under good leadership more often than not. When you operate under people you trust, respect, and want to follow, it positively impacts your entire life—not just at work, but at home too. It’s easy to spot models of healthy and unhealthy leadership in the workplace, and of course the same can be said for our churches.    \n\nThe Apostle Paul took Christian leadership seriously because he understood the impact of an authoritative voice. In his letter to Titus, Paul begins with a declaration of his identity, calling himself “a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ” (Titus 1:1). He also lays out his mission statement: to build up the church in the truth so their lives would change and they would receive God’s promised eternal life (vv. 1-3). With Paul as a model of faithful leadership in the early Church, we see that a godly leader finds their identity and purpose in the Lord. \n\nWhile Paul starts the letter with the state of his own heart, he continues by addressing the requirements for elders, saying in short: it matters how you live your life. He warns against corrupt leaders who are “full of empty talk and deception” because he knows the damage those people wreak (v. 10). Instead, Paul calls for an elder to be “not arrogant, not hot-tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a bully, not greedy for money, but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled, holding to the faithful message as taught” (vv. 7-8). To use a well-worn but apt cliche, a godly leader is not just someone who can “talk the talk,” but a person who “walks the walk.” Better still, a godly leader is one who walks toward Jesus.\n\nWhose lead are we following today? And where are we leading those who follow us? This is not a call to ignore our bosses or disregard those in leadership over us, but rather to be conscious of who is shaping us on a soul level. Are we following those whose identity and purpose are found in the Lord, who live godly lives? \n\nPaul’s letter to Titus gives a good template for what godly leadership looks like, but ultimately, our only perfect leader is Jesus—Jesus, who came in the fullness of God, yet took on the form of a baby and served the broken people of this world to the point of death on a cross. Jesus is the only leader who understands our every feeling and can wipe away our every sin. He is a better guide than any worldly influencer and the only one worthy of surrendering your life to. If you’re looking for a leader who will never fail you, look no further than the feet of Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Titus 2:1-15, Malachi 3:17-18, 1 John 3:2-3\n\nWhen my husband and I went to graduate school, we found a darling old home to rent on a popular street in St. Louis. It had antique door knobs, stained glass windows, and an old-fashioned brass post box that the mailman would slip our mail through each day. I swooned when we moved in, enchanted by all the architectural elements and the original hardwoods and the stunning, old stone fireplace. \n\nI loved that house, until I didn’t. Until we found a mouse, until the emerald green tile in the shower collapsed on my visiting brother-in-law, until our gas bill was more than $400 in the wintertime, the foundation literally started crumbling into the basement, and the water that ran from the taps turned brown inexplicably and then stayed that way. The house was beautiful and charming, but it wasn’t sound. \n\nWhen Paul writes to Titus, the church in Crete was experiencing a similar sort of story. Many people were teaching a Christianity that looked appealing, but was antithetical to the gospel. Titus 1 explains this in detail as Paul tells Titus that the false teachers are “ruining entire households” (v. 11). Theirs was an unsound gospel, and Paul knew the church in Crete was not safe on such a weak foundation.\n\nIn Titus 2, Paul exhorts each member of the household to carry their own weight toward sound teaching. Everyone had a task: older men and older women, young women and young men, slaves and their masters. From “teach what is good” to “be sound beyond reproach,” Paul’s instructions were serious, so that “God’s word would not be slandered” (vv. 1–9). \n\nPaul probably could have stopped there. He was respected by Titus, who would take his words to heart. Paul could trust Titus to put the gospel first. But Paul continues on. In Titus 2:11–14, he recounts the glorious gift of the gospel. Paul’s ballast is Scripture; he is stabilized by grace. Paul is hardly one to say “just do this,” but instead illustrates why someone ought to. He writes:\n\n“For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, instructing us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly way in the present age, while we wait for the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ” (vv. 11–13).\n\nI can’t help but think of my toddler, who adores Laura Numeroff’s picture book, If You Give A Mouse a Cookie. The rest of that sentence is, “he’ll ask for a glass of milk.” The theme goes on and on, a series of if-thens that build throughout the book. \n\nPaul’s closing statements in chapter 2 are a cosmically important “if-then,” telling Christians how to act: If Jesus really brought salvation, then you have to deny worldly lusts and live in a godly way. \n\nThe false teachers in Crete were not living out a gospel that matched the work of Christ. Sound theology mattered to Paul; integrity to the gospel should matter to all of us. May we continue to rely on the unfettered grace that God gives to us to live out our lives in a way that honors him. May we rest soundly on the gospel, our foundation in faith.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Titus 3:1-15, 2 Corinthians 1:3-11, Ephesians 2:8-10\n\nGoodness, this passage reads like such good advice! The kind of advice I usually receive is more like:\n\nLay the baby on her front. (Read: late 80s.)\n\nLay the baby on her back. (Read: early 90s.)\n\nDon’t sit on cold concrete. (Why?)\n\nClean the baseboards every week. (Please don’t make me.)\n\nIf you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all. (This is actually pretty good advice.)\n\nNever miss an opportunity to go to the lavatory. (It’s just true.)\n\nOf course, receiving good advice and following it are two very different things. (I definitely don’t keep my baseboards properly cleaned.) We are often tempted to think that just knowing the right thing should be enough, a kind of salvation-by-information or salvation-by-education. But, as Paul points out, we aren’t the kind of people who just need another good bit of advice. We aren’t following the good advice we’ve already heard.\n\nIn fact, Paul is writing something much different from an advice column. He is talking about a transformation of life. We, left to ourselves “were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures” (Titus 3:3). And it wasn’t merely a bit of good advice that saved us. It was not someone offering an odious, “Here’s what you oughta do…” No, it was grace. God poured out His Spirit on us through Jesus Christ. We were justified, not by following a nifty list of suggestions, but purely by grace.\n\nThis salvation by grace, through Christ, by the work of His Spirit, is what we are to insist on. It is this which actually transforms us. Yes, there are things we ought to do and ought not to do, but grace alone is sufficient to transform us from fools who refuse sound wisdom, to sons and daughters who walk in the righteousness of Christ. “Insist on these things,” Paul says, “so that those who have believed God might be careful to devote themselves to good works” (v. 8). Devotion to good works is the fruit of God’s gracious work of transformation.\n\nDon’t worry about advice. It’s tempting to read Paul’s words as a list of how we are falling short, and how we need to change our behavior so we fit in as God’s kind of people. We are already God’s people. While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. And because of His sacrifice and His grace, He is changing us from the inside out. The work is done by Him. Step into the waters of regeneration and walk out a new creation. Paul is describing a whole new kind of humanity, one not achieved by human effort, but by God’s redemptive grace.\n\nThanks be to God!\n\n",

As a senior in college I enrolled in a sculpture class—while majoring in German. I understand words, but I do not understand shapes. Trying to sculpt a three-dimensional representation of the human head turned out to be the only collegiate task that could reliably make me cry. I could not comprehend how to shape the turn of a lip or the curve of a nose. The rest of the class would talk about differing angles or closing one eye while looking at the model, but it was an impenetrable mystery to me.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews is trying to explain something completely different to an audience of Jewish Christians who were already being persecuted for their faith. Though they were believers, the concept of Jesus as Messiah was something would have been difficult to imagine until about 70 years prior, when Jesus was born. Some knew He was the Savior, although what that meant to them varied and was still largely misunderstood. The author is still trying to introduce us to this nearly incomprehensible concept: the God-Man. Without talking down to the reader, he explains clearly, from the very beginning, the nature of this strange and wonderful person who is both God and man.\n\nIn the first chapter of Hebrews, the writer essentially asks the question, What is the nature of the Son? and what’s more, Why does the nature of the Son matter? \n\nFirst, the Son replaces the prophets and fulfills their prophecies. He is both the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of God’s nature. Worthy of all worship, He is superior to the angels and remains the same forever (Hebrews 1:3–11). Indeed, God “has spoken to us by his Son” and “has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him” (vv.1–2). \n\nHow awesome is Christ, the Son! And yet this very Christ, the creator and sustainer of the world, is also the One who purifies us from our sin by His own sacrifice. He speaks directly to us and acts on our behalf—the same God whom all the fiery angels serve! Both the new covenant and the eternal priesthood of Christ are the unfathomable gift of God to a sinful people in need of a Savior.\n\nWithout Christ there is an overwhelming barrier between us and God, between our sinfulness and His holiness. But in Christ we find an even more overwhelming answer. We cannot comprehend the greatness of His glory or the awesomeness of His majesty, yet in Christ we are made daughters and heirs of His kingdom, having been washed clean by His blood.\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her five little people.

But today’s passage in Hebrews starts with a verse containing the conjunctive adverb, “therefore” (the CSB translates it “for this reason”), so a little grammar ditty may help remind us what exactly a conjunction is and, well, how it functions. \n\nLike a regular conjunction (such as “and” or “but”), a conjunctive adverb connects two words or clauses; however, it also shows the relationship between two ideas. Therefore, the author of Hebrews must be trying to draw a connection for us between two related thoughts. While we can assume the writer didn’t set out to begin the chapter this way (chapters weren’t added to the Bible until the 1200s), we can look back to the preceding chapter to see what the first idea is.\n\nIn chapter 1, the author establishes that Jesus is the Son of God, and that He is superior to the angels in authority, as Creator, and in His role as the author of our salvation. In chapter 2, we read that because Jesus is superior to the angels, believers should hold tight to their belief in Him (v.1). That while He is superior to everything and everyone we could ever imagine, He is also the God who remembers us and cares for us (v.6). \n\nAt the time of this letter, the original audience of Hebrews was in danger of walking away from their faith. They were persecuted, misunderstood, and targeted for their belief in Jesus Christ. And so the author is writing a book-long defense of believing in Jesus, beginning with this one conjunctive adverb: therefore or\n\nbecause.\n\nBecause Jesus is superior to the angels…\n\nBecause His gospel is better than the Law given to Moses…\n\nBecause Jesus is co-equal with God, but also because He became fully man…\n\nBecause of His signs and wonders and miracles…\n\nBecause everything is subjected under His feet…\n\nBecause of His suffering and death—\n\nListen! Don’t drift away. \n\nThe temptation to drift away was not just a concern for this audience of Jewish Christians; it is real for all of us, all of the time. From the ancient believers who found themselves facing death or being treated as outcasts because of their faith, to modern-day believers like us who struggle to believe for a myriad reasons, this passage in Hebrews reminds us that our faith is anchored in the person and work of Jesus. \n\nAll of Hebrews sings this song: Jesus is who He said He was, and He is who God promised He would be. Therefore, we believe.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 2:10-18, Hebrews 3:1-6, Genesis 12:1-3, Acts 10:34-43\n\nI fell in love with our old farmhouse before I knew I already loved its builder. We’d just made an offer on the place and were giving my husband’s family a tour when his grandpa (affectionately known to us as Papaw) said, “I remember when I built this house.” \n\nWe bumped into each other at the base of our oak staircase banister as if someone had just pulled an invisible emergency break, bringing the tour to an abrupt stop.\n\n“You built this house?” we asked, astounded. \n\nOur home was built long before either of us was born. Papaw was a much younger man then, running his own contractor business. We’d picked out our house online and made an offer on the spot without even considering who had laid the foundation so many years before. The idea that we had chosen a home carefully constructed by a man who chose to love us was a precious dose of unexpected grace.  \n\nPapaw is gone now and we are blessed to remember him every time we run our hands down the banister he installed, shuffle our socked feet across the hardwood floors he laid, or gaze out the large picture window he set into place. Our house is more sacred to us because of whose hands swung the hammer that put it together. \n\nIn today’s passages, the writer of Hebrews is asking his readers to lift their eyes off of Moses and onto the Greater One. We might not fixate so much on the greatness of Moses these days, but we do tend to treasure the wrong prize. A cosmic shift occurs in our souls when we acknowledge that everything we love and treasure ultimately belongs to God. It all matters because He matters so much. “Now every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God” (Hebrews 3:4). \n\nThis circles back and underscores a thought from the second chapter of Hebrews. We find it sandwiched between two commas, yet it deserves its own exclamation point: “For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, is bringing so many sons to glory…” (v.10). \n\nWe hear it in the words of Colossians 1: “For everything was created by him, in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things have been created through him and for him” (v.16). \n\nAnd we see it again in the first chapter of John’s Gospel. It reads: “All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created” (v.3). \n\nIt’s tempting to think we’re the ones buildings something here: We’re building a family. We’re building a career. We’re building a home. But all of these things are God’s handiwork; they are already His. He crafted it long ago—every beam, every person, every bloom. \n\nJust like the Hebrews, we tend to elevate the message over the Messiah, the prophet over the High Priest, the creation above the Creator. But Scripture pulls an invisible emergency break on this tour of our pride. How much better it is to trust in the Builder than in the building (Hebrews 2:13).

    "devo_title": "Warning Against Unbelief",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 3:7-19, John 3:16-21, Romans 11:1-6\n\nHands down, my favorite day of the year during elementary school was field day. On field day, each class wore matching t-shirts and competed in outdoor events like the 100-yard dash, Red Rover, and the ultimate team challenge: tug-of-war.\n\nI always felt a rush of nerves as my class stepped up to the rope to compete against the other classes in our grade. I was tall and lanky, not the strongest kid, but I knew none of that mattered in tug-of-war, because it took everyone’s strength to win, not just mine. And when I got tired, I could loosen my grip knowing my classmates would pick up the slack.\n\nOur passage today points to this type of teamwork—not in the context of field day, of course, but in the context of faith and the community effort it so often requires.\n\nWe can assume some individuals from the community addressed in Hebrews had been loosening their grip on their faith, swaying toward unbelief, the type of unbelief that leads to rebellion against God. The writer warns, “Watch out, brothers and sisters, so that there won’t be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God” (Hebrews 3:12).\n\nAs God’s people, we have a long history of this type of unbelief. From the Israelites wandering in the desert, to the early church addressed here in Hebrews, to Christians today—our tendency is to believe in ourselves and our own way over God and His. Fortunately, the writer of Hebrews provides a strategy to guard ourselves against unbelief: \n\n“But encourage each other daily, while it is still called today,\n\nso that none of you is hardened by sin’s deception” (v.13).\n\nIn other words, if you want to stay away from unbelief, stay together.\n\nThe more I walk this road of faith, the more I realize how corporate the practice of faith must be if we are going to maintain it. The very nature of our faith is communal. We serve a triune God who from the beginning has been committed to communing with us. So much so, that He came to be with us in human form through the person of Jesus Christ, who then died so that we might commune with God for eternity.\n\nWe are not meant to believe alone. I think this is why the writer of Hebrews so earnestly warns against unbelief, and then in the same breath reminds us to encourage one another. When I am on the brink of unbelief, it is always community that pulls me back to the truth of the gospel. If I’d had to face the other team alone, I surely would have abandoned the rope long ago. But knowing I have others there who have strength when I don’t has provided the encouragement I’ve needed to stay in the game.  \n\nThis is why I find this passage so hopeful. Just as much as it is a warning against unbelief, it is also a reminder that we don’t have to go up against unbelief alone. Because our Messiah is our companion, we have companionship with each other.\n\nAndrea Lucado is a freelance writer, Texas native, and the author of the memoir English Lessons: The Crooked Path of Growing Toward Faith.

    "devo_title": "The Promised Rest",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 4:1-13, Psalm 95:7-11, 1 Peter 1:3-5\n\nThe promised rest.\n\nIn today’s busy culture, especially in the United States, that phrase seems too good to be true. I tend to crave rest in different ways, depending on the season I’m in. When I was in college, running myself ragged, I would have given anything for a quick cat nap during the day, but now I just long for a solid eight hours of sleep at night. \n\nThe kind of rest described in Hebrews chapter 4 is not the nap our bodies beg for after a busy day. God invited the Israelites into His rest, into the Sabbath, when they were wandering in the wilderness. However, they rebelled and did not enter into His rest because of their disobedient, discontented hearts. We are offered this same rest; it is promised to us because of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross. But the full Sabbath, the truest rest promised to us by God, will not occur until we are face to face with our Maker in eternity. \n\nIn the meantime, of course, God gives us a Sabbath each week—a day to rest, reconnect with God, and recenter our lives around Him. But if I’m honest, a real Sabbath feels unattainable to me today. Maybe the busyness our culture has come to call “normal” speaks to our true priorities. Or maybe we’re just looking at the Sabbath through the wrong lens. \n\nWhat if practicing the Sabbath includes sinking our teeth into the things that provide us with a taste of heaven? What if it’s savoring the morning light as it streams through our curtains, or relishing the feeling of propping our feet up on the coffee table after a long day of work? What if rest comes in cherishing moments of laughter and tears with the people around us who pull us closer to Jesus? What if we were to breathe all of this in as it happens, thanking God for these things in the moment, with the knowledge that our ultimate rest—our eternal salvation—is secure in Christ?\n\nThe true rest we long for will not fully come this side of heaven. The author of Hebrews tells us “a Sabbath rest remains for God’s people” (4:9). He encourages us to “make every effort to enter that rest” (v.11). The price has already been paid by Jesus. The “effort” we now make is to remain in Him as He remains in us (John 15:4). So we continue the work He’s given us to do, living in the tension that the kingdom of God is here and now, but also still to come and greater than we can imagine. We keep leaning in to God for strength as He builds His kingdom through us. And we find Sabbath rest where we are, in the presence of God Most High.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 4:14-16, Hebrews 5:1-10, Psalm 110:1-7, Matthew 4:1-11\n\nI used to think I had to sacrifice a lot of things in order for God to love me. \n\nI have this vivid memory from my high school youth group. At one particular meeting, we listened to one of the “stars” of our youth group give a testimony about how he believed God was calling him to quit baseball and give all his time and energy to God. So he quit. His choice to make a big sacrifice was glorified and applauded. And I wondered, What is God calling me to sacrifice? What do I have to give up for Him to love me? What would be enough?\n\nOof.\n\nIt took me years to identify how traumatic that message was for me. Though I don’t aim to judge one person’s actions and how they follow the promptings of the Spirit, the glamorization of that choice was embedded in my mind. I lived in fear that if I didn’t sacrifice the things I loved to do or wear or make or buy, then I wasn’t doing enough for God. I thought He would punish me instead.\n\nAnd so I walked around afraid that God was going to take everything and everyone I loved away from me. I began to see my relationship with Him as a give-and-take where He only took, and I only gave. I didn’t know that is literally the opposite of what the Bible tells us.\n\nI didn’t understand that what I owe to God is more than I could ever give. I didn’t understand that “sacrificing” wouldn’t make me a better Christian. In fact, it wouldn’t make me a Christian at all. I didn’t understand that the debt I owe to God is because of my sin, and that Jesus is the only One who could pay it. Without Jesus, I was—and I am—helpless to stand before God.\n\nThe truth is God does require something for the payment of our sins, because His is a perfect justice. But thankfully, the balance of His mercy does not rest on me. It rests solely on Jesus, who “became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him” (Hebrews 5:9).\n\nThe closing verse of Edward Mote’s classic hymn, “My Hope is Built on Nothing Less,” says: Oh, may I then in Him be found, / dressed in His righteousness alone, / faultless to stand before the throne. Today’s passage from Hebrews beckons us to do the same, to “approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in time of need” (Hebrews 4:16).\n\nBoldness. Some translations say “with confidence,” which we have only in the security of Christ. We don’t have to approach the throne with fear, with everything we love bundled up to lay on an altar, thinking that what we have to offer is somehow going to be enough to pay for our sin—because it isn’t.\n\nOnly Jesus is enough.\n\nJesus is our Great High Priest (v.14). Traditionally, high priests would offer sacrifices to atone for the sins of the people and themselves, because they sinned too. But Jesus’s sinless perfection made His sacrifice the source of eternal salvation for everyone who would ever believe.\n\nThis is an eternal, unchanging truth: We are not enough. Only Christ’s righteousness allows us to approach God’s throne with confidence, to receive the grace and mercy He offers us. Thanks be to God!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 5:11-14, Hebrews 6:1-12, Philippians 3:12-16, 1 Peter 2:1-3\n\nI feel like I’m a great gal. I go to church (but only when all five of my kids aren’t sick). I read my Bible (unless I am very tired or very busy or extremely lazy). I pray (especially when I have lost my glasses). And I write about Scripture (because it’s my dream job and people pay me to do it). \n\nOkay, so I’m a great gal with some mixed motives. But here’s the trouble: It’s actually pretty possible to look like a believer, enjoy the fellowship of believers, and even do a lot of the right things externally, but still not touch the heart of the matter. It’s possible to do all of these things without maturing in the faith and truly knowing God. \n\nAll of these good works may make me think I’m a great gal. They can certainly look like the fruit of the gospel at work in my life. But Scripture tells us our works are dead when we depend on them for our salvation (Romans 3:27–4:5). The author of Hebrews is warning us to stop focusing on such “elementary teaching about Christ and go on to maturity” (Hebrews 6:1).\n\nNo matter how many orphanages you visit in Haiti, you cannot save yourself. No matter how many women you rescue out of slavery, you cannot rescue yourself. Christ alone saves us. His desire is that we grow in maturity by the Holy Spirit, working out our faith to full assurance, which is only found in Christ (v.11).\n\nIf we are keeping lists of our own merits, even if just in our heads and hearts, it is a real danger. We cannot work our way to righteousness. But the temptation to rely on our own merits is powerful. The Church is warned about this in no uncertain terms. If we seek after good works more than we desire Christ, we are in grave danger. Beware, lest we fall away and come short of salvation! Only Christ is sufficient to save.\n\nYet “God is not unjust; he will not forget [our] work and the love [we] demonstrated for his name by serving the saints—and by continuing to serve them” (v.10). When we look to Christ for our salvation, our humble doings flow from gratitude to the One who saves us. We love others because we imitate the One who is love (1 John 4:8). We serve because He is the servant of all. Our good works don’t earn our salvation; they are the result of our salvation, fruit born of the Holy Spirit at work in us (Galatians 5:22–23).\n\nLet us look beyond the work of our own hands and instead place our hope in Christ’s finished work on the cross. May we hear His call to daily repentance and obedience. And may our works flow out of total thankfulness to God, our Creator and Redeemer.\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her five little people.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 6:13-20, Hebrews 7:1-10, Genesis 22:15-18, Romans 8:28-30\n\nI discovered my first gray hair this week. Being in my mid-twenties, I’ve always believed this event would unfold naturally and gracefully decades from now, like a badge of honor for a seasoned and experienced woman. It did not happen that way. However, as I sifted through my dark brown strands to find the one that wasn’t, I couldn’t help but think of my grandmother. I’ve never gotten through a conversation with someone who knew Polly without mention of her rare poise, cheeks full of laughter, and of course, her beautiful silver hair.\n\nThere are some things I inherited right away from my grandmother, like the pearl earrings she’d received on a special anniversary and the cooking tools that still smelled like her house. I inherited her love for music, the same knack for penmanship, and a preference for extra-sour lemonade. And then there are things I didn’t know I’d get from Polly, even after she was gone—things like her fountain pen, which my aunt gave me because I became a writer, and the aforementioned early appearance of gray hairs.\n\nThere’s something about an inheritance that roots you in a sense of belonging. Or in some cases, you find out there’s been a place for you all along. In Hebrews 6, we find that our inheritance is both current and eternal. It is everything we need, exactly what we’d hoped, and all we never thought to ask for.\n\nI love how thorough God is in His promises. It’s as if He takes joy in watching His children read His Word and learn His Will, savoring each gift along the way. Two big themes in the book of Hebrews are revelation and redemption, and God’s covenant with His people is what bridges the two.\n\n“Because God wanted to show his unchangeable purpose even more clearly to the heirs of the promise, he guaranteed it with an oath, so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us” (Hebrews 6:17–18). Notice the two unchangeable things here: God’s promise and God’s oath. He wants to make doubly sure we know that our inheritance in Him is true.\n\nMaybe we don’t realize our inheritance through the way we age or through hand-me-downs in the cupboard, but just like He did for Abraham, God makes sure we know we’ve obtained the promise. He is the only One who can give us the sweetest inheritance of all: Himself. “We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure” (Hebrews 6:19). May we continue to hold fast to Him, our hope and our prize. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 7:11-28, Genesis 14:18-20, 1 John 2:1\n\nI am raising four boys on a farm full of mud. \n\nThrough much threatening, cajoling, scrubbing and—okay, I’ll admit it—bribing, I can occasionally get everyone clean. But there isn’t enough soap and water in the universe to ensure that they will stay clean. Most often, we don’t even make it to the car before someone (or everyone) becomes more soiled than spiffed up. \n\nThe Levitical priests could surely more than feel my pain. Once a year they would go to great lengths to ask the Lord to clean out the record of sin accumulated by His people. After extensive preparations, a priest would enter the most holy place inside the veil to present a sin offering (Leviticus 16:2–34). Verse 30 tells us: “Atonement will be made for you on this day to cleanse you, and you will be clean from all your sins before the LORD.” And so when the priest exited, God’s people were clean. It was a holy scrubbing, but never a permanent one. \n\nYear after year, the priests would enter the tabernacle to atone for the people’s sins, only to return again a year later. This was not an exercise in futility, but God’s provisional means of covering their sin. It was also an object lesson for generations to come, teaching them that nothing we could ever do—no matter how meticulously planned and executed—to make these “filthy rags” clean. We can scrub and scrub and scrub and the muck of sin will stick to us, making it impossible for us to be in the presence of our holy, holy, holy God (Revelation 4:8).  \n\nSo we keep scouring, don’t we? Until our hearts and souls feel raw from the effort. We need the reminder that we cannot obtain perfection through human striving. God’s law doesn’t polish us up to a high shine; instead, it exposes every gritty imperfection (v.19). \n\nThe priests couldn’t keep us clean because they were stained by sin too. We’ve always been the blind leading the blind, the stained scrubbing the stained. We needed someone untarnished by sin to enter the Holy Place on our behalf. “For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens” (v.26). Christ is the true high priest, and His is the superior priesthood. He is the only permanent solution to our sin problem. His blood alone, shed on the cross, has the power to truly cleanse us. \n\nThe lyrics of Elisha A. Hoffman’s old gospel hymn, “Are You Washed in the Blood of the Lamb,” sum it up well:\n\nHave you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?\n\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?…\n\nAre your garments spotless?\n\nAre they white as snow?\n\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?\n\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is an invitation to stop our scrubbing and to bathe in the deluge of grace that flows from the cross. Our perfect Savior made a way for us to be cleansed—permanently. May we fully trust in His grace this hour, and the next, and all the ones to follow.\n\n",

To get there, we traveled to a remote location in central China on a bus that swayed along treacherous roads. I refused to look out the window for the majority of the drive because I was certain my gaze would draw us down to the canyon below. But soon enough a series of brown tapered roofs came into focus, hanging from the side of the mountain like an ancient rock climber with a strong grip. \n\nTo this day, Xuan Kong Monastery—also known as “the Hanging Monastery”—is one of the most interesting places of religious worship I’ve ever visited. Built 1,400 years ago, the walls and floors creaked with every step. My sense of awe may have actually been fear as I walked the narrow hallways, worried that at any moment the whole thing might crumble to the ground.\n\nNot too long ago, I read through a She Reads Truth study called See the Lord’s Salvation: A Lenten Study of Exodus, where I studied the God-given plans for another remarkable place of worship, one designed to honor God and built by His chosen people, the Israelites. (Go back to this study of Exodus to see the deep and intricate meaning of each detail in those plans.) But no matter how beautiful the tabernacle might have been, it was a human creation, a copy and a shadow of what was in heaven (Hebrews 8:5). Just like the Hanging Monastery in China, the tabernacle was fragile.\n\nOur churches and pastors and priests today are weak too. The walls creak. The leaders fail. Sometimes it feels like the sanctuaries do nothing more than remind us of our need. If that’s all they do, I’m okay with that. I need a better priest than the best on earth. I need a better temple.\n\nHere’s what’s amazing. “The true tabernacle set up by the Lord” (v.2) isn’t a destination with walls and nails. It is a communion we have with God in our hearts. For we are God’s temple and the Spirit of God lives in us (1 Corinthians 3:16–17). And Jesus, our High Priest and Good Shepherd, “is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises” (Hebrews 8:6). \n\nJesus is the kind of priest we need in a better sanctuary than we could ever build. He takes us with all our heartsickness, sin, and need, and gives us access to the Father. In that secret room, the one in our spirit, our Father waits, ready to meet with us. \n\n",

It’s hard to imagine things will ever look much different than this, what’s right in front of us today. \n\nI doubt that even the most imaginative Israelites in Egypt could have fathomed their miraculous escape from slavery across the dry ocean floor (Exodus 13:17–14:31). The disciples huddled together in Jerusalem could not have foreseen the power of Pentecost, even in their wildest dreams. I mean, tongues of fire? Crazy! (Acts 2:3). And when we were slaves to our sin, we could not have comprehend being truly free (Romans 6:17; John 8:36). It seems our God is always moving us toward something better, something brighter—something more than we dare to ask, imagine, or hope for (Ephesians 3:20). \n\nThose who worshiped under the Old Testament covenant surely could not have grasped all that Jesus would usher in. That a day would dawn when sacrifices of animal blood were no longer required because Christ’s blood was sufficient to atone once and for all. That God’s presence wouldn’t rest between the angel’s wings on the ark of the covenant (Exodus 25:17–22), but would move freely in our hearts. That a time was coming when the law would not be written on slabs of stone, but instead on the hearts and minds of God’s beloved children (Jeremiah 31:33). That the curtain of the tabernacle would be torn in two, making a way for sinners to enter the presence of God (Matthew 27:51). \n\nYet, here we are, “speaking of a new covenant, [by which] he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away” (Hebrews 8:13). Today, we are the recipients of the avalanche of grace Moses could only dream of. We are free in a way even the Israelites who fled Egypt never knew. Under the new covenant, we have been saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. This is a gift from God by which all our wrongdoing is forgiven, our sins never to be remembered again (Ephesians 2:8–9; Hebrews 8:12).\n\nThe old is gone and the new, superior covenant of grace is better than our wildest hopes. But we are also broken people, still stuck in this broken world and so easily convinced that this is all there is. Yet God is moving us onward, toward something unthinkably good. All that we see is ready to vanish away because our God is making all things new (Revelation 21:1–5).\n\nMaybe you can’t quite picture it. Perhaps your heart doesn’t dare believe it, but that won’t stop the Lord from delivering it. The best is truly yet to come.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 9:1-15, Leviticus 16:6-19, 2 Corinthians 1:10\n\nMaybe it’s this season of life I’m in where everything seems ridden with uncertainty and doubt, but sometimes it’s hard for me to remember that God is near to me. It’s hard for me to remember that I have access to Him through the Holy Spirit at all times. It’s hard for me to remember that even when I don’t have the words to speak, He still listens.\n\nUnder the old covenant described in the first part of Hebrews 9, God’s people were unable to communicate with Him directly. While the priests could enter into the first room of the tabernacle to perform their ministry of sacrifices, God’s presence was contained inside the holy of holies of the tabernacle, a place only the high priest could enter but once a year, and only then to provide a sacrifice for himself and God’s people to cover the sins they had committed. \n\nThe author of Hebrews consistently uses Old Testament references and stories to tell his readers about the better hope they have in Christ. In referencing the old covenant, which they were undoubtedly familiar with, the author is reminding them of the freedom they now have in Christ—freedom to acknowledge God’s nearness and drink in His presence. Christ took the place of the high priest, entering into the most holy place, sacrificing Himself, and cleansing us with His blood (Hebrews 9:11–14). \n\n“[Christ] is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance, because a death has taken place for redemption from the transgressions committed under the first covenant” (v.15).\n\nChrist is the Great High Priest, and because of His sacrifice on the cross, God is ever-present with us. We don’t have to rely on a human high priest to go before God on our behalf; Christ does that for us. He looks at us and says that we are His children, His people—that nothing can separate us from His love (Romans 8:38).\n\nIt’s not always easy to remember that we have instant access to our Father. In situations where we don’t know what to say or pray or do, we feel alone. We forget He is already near to us—nearer than our very breath. But reminders of this new covenant ministry, a ministry we are now an active part of, keep us grounded in the knowledge that God is with us and for us. Always.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "What Forgiveness Requires",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 9:16-28, John 10:10, 2 Timothy 1:8-10\n\nWhat is the cost of forgiveness? \n\nI can forgive my husband for forgetting to feed the dogs and it costs me nothing. I can forgive someone for hurting my child, but it costs me a little more. I can even forgive the person who has hurt me most in this world, and it still costs me only the decision to forgive, even if I have to make the decision again and again. But what good does my forgiveness render? Certainly peace for me, and possibly some kind of peace for the one I forgive.\n\nOur forgiveness is vitally important, but there is a greater forgiveness that changes everything. Our forgiveness doesn’t actually yield eternal pardon for the offender, and that’s why it doesn’t cost us much. But in order to actually pay for one transgression of God’s law, someone has to literally die. That’s the deal. The wages of sin is actual death (Romans 6:23). A sacrifice must be made. But the sacrifice has to be totally without sin, so none of us can just valiantly die for our own sins. We need a sinless sacrifice. \n\nOur forgiveness is only possible because Christ is that sinless sacrifice. \n\nNow, because sin has been paid for, we have life and joy abundantly. By sacrificing Himself, He has removed our sins (Hebrews 9:26). When Christ comes again, He will come bringing the fulfillment of our salvation: everlasting life in glory.\n\nThis passage in Hebrews 9 seems to be about establishing the justice and legality of what Christ did. It is delivered in covenantal and transactional terms. Why? It is important to know that what Christ did, He did rightly. He didn’t cut corners, or sweep sin under the rug. He dealt with it fully, fairly, finally. Because of this, we can have great assurance and security in Christ. When Satan attempts to undermine our faith with doubt, we can lean on our righteousness of Christ. His payment for sin is fully sufficient. His grace is greater than all our sin, and nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews further his point with a comparison. The first covenant was also inaugurated with blood (v.18). But all the blood of bulls and goats could not fully satisfy the demands of justice. The blood of animals was sprinkled on the earthly tabernacle and its furnishings. But the blood of Christ, the only perfect and sufficient sacrifice, has purified even the heavenly things (v.23). His payment for our sin has paid our debt from the depths of earth to the heights of heaven.\n\nForgiveness requires the shedding of blood. And Christ’s blood has been shed for us. \n\nWhat then can man do to us? What can Satan say to topple such a salvation? Thanks be to God, we are secure in Christ. When Christ returns, we are told, He will come, not to pay a further debt (all our sins have been paid for!), but to bring salvation (v.28).

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 10:1-18, Psalm 40:1-17, 1 Peter 2:24\n\nTwice, my girlfriends have talked me into running a half marathon. And twice, my knees have revolted. Both times I hobbled across that finish line, I was so ready to be done. But can you imagine if I had decided to just keep running? I surely cannot. Yet, oftentimes in our spiritual lives we keep running a race that’s already been won. We keep thinking that if we just jog another lap, add on a few more miles, somehow we will be more qualified.\n\nThe thing is, Jesus ran the perfect race and won the final victory for us. With the sacrifice of His life He proclaimed, “It is finished” (John 19:28–30). So why don’t we accept the gift of grace? And if we have accepted it, why don’t we choose to live into it?\n\nGrace can be difficult to accept. While we all want forgiveness and unconditional love, the world has taught us that forgiveness is not easily won and love always comes with limits. It can be hard to live in the reality of God, in the truth of the gospel. We might picture our heavenly Father like an earthly one, disappointed or angry or withholding. We might think He judges us with a harsh eye. But God’s love is like nothing in this world, and until we open our hearts to His grace we will keep on needlessly trying to prove ourselves.\n\nUnlike the priests who had to daily return to their work, when Jesus offered His sufficient “sacrifice for sins forever, [He] sat down at the right hand of God” (Hebrews 10:12). He sat down. This symbolized completeness and finality. He didn’t pace around. He didn’t wring His hands. He didn’t find more busywork to do. He sat down at the right hand of His Father.\n\nChrist’s sacrifice is complete. It was also made “once for all time” (Hebrews 10:10), which means the gospel is always fresh. And because our hearts so easily forget this news that seems too good to be true, we need to be reminded again and again: every morning when we step out of bed, weary from a world we’ve barely woken to, every time we stumble and fall, and every time we believe the lie that we need to somehow earn the love of God. The repeated sacrifices of the old covenant can now be replaced with repeated proclamations of the gospel to ourselves and to our brothers and sisters.\n\nMaybe God is inviting you to sit down at His feet today—to just be with Him. To soak yourself in Christ’s finished work for you. You are saved, not by your own will or work, but by the perfect blood of Jesus. Rest easy in the presence of your Redeemer.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 10:19-39, Deuteronomy 32:35-36, Matthew 27:50-54\n\nThe universal law of cause and effect says that for every effect there is a cause, and likewise, for every cause there is an effect. Why am I giving you a refresher course in seventh-grade natural science? Because applying this law to our passage today is crucial in understanding hope in light of Christ’s faithfulness to us.\n\nHebrews 10:23 says, “Let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, since he who promised is faithful.” With “since” being the key word, we can determine that the law of cause and effect applied to this verse would go something like this:\n\nCause: He who promised is faithful.\n\nEffect: We hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering.\n\nWhat if we changed the placement of the word “since” to read, “Since we hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, he who promised is faithful”? It would entirely change our cause and effect, right?\n\nCause: We hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering.\n\nEffect: He who promised is faithful.\n\nIn the first set of cause-and-effect statements, we hold on to hope because Christ has been faithful to us. In the second, Christ is faithful to us because we hold on to hope.\n\nIf Christ’s faithfulness to me is contingent upon my hope, I’m in big trouble. My hope is not consistent. It varies from day to day, depending upon my circumstances, the weather, or how much coffee I’ve had. My hope can be high one hour and plummet the next.\n\nFortunately, Hebrews does not say we hold on to hope because we are a people who are so very good at hoping. It says we hold on to hope because Christ has been faithful. As the verses leading up to this one emphasize, “since we have boldness to enter the sanctuary through the blood of Jesus… and since we have a great high priest over the house of God… let us draw near… Let us hold on to the confession of our hope” (Hebrews 10:19,21–23).\n\nThe blood of Jesus, our Great High Priest, His faithfulness—this is why we hold on to hope.\n\nIt has taken me a long time to grasp this idea that living a life of faith is so much more about God’s faithfulness to me than it is my faithfulness to Him. To be honest, I still don’t think I completely get it. If I did, I would have far less anxiety, I would sin far less, and I would have much more hope. I need this reminder as much as the early Church did. When I feel hopeless, I need to repeat the cause again and again:\n\nSince He…\n\nSince He…\n\nSince He…\n\nHave hope today—not in your ability to hold onto hope, but in Christ’s faithfulness to you. It does not waver. It is the same day in and day out—yesterday, today, and forever. When we rely on His faithfulness alone, our posture toward life will be one of hope and not fear, of trust and not turning away. As the writer said, “We are not those who draw back and are destroyed, but those who have faith and obtain life” (v.39).\n\nAndrea Lucado is a freelance writer, Texas native, and the author of the memoir English Lessons: The Crooked Path of Growing Toward Faith.

    "devo_title": "Living by Faith",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 11:1-16, Psalm 33:6-7, John 1:9-13\n\nI recently read a novel by Min Jin Lee called Pachinko. Set in WWII, the story follows an immigrant Korean family that lives in Japan for four generations. The book chronicles their bold acts of faith, fortitude, and survival in the midst of oppression and racial prejudice. I won’t spoil the ending here, but rest assured the ending isn’t what makes the book worth reading. It’s the beginning, middle, and end, all woven together like a symphony. I’ve bought multiple copies, handing them out like candy.\n\nLikewise, the author of Hebrews recounts a family history. Our family history. Each tale is a marriage of belief and action—basically, faith and verbs. \n\nBy faith Abel offered.\n\nBy faith Noah built.\n\nBy faith Abraham obeyed and went.\n\nBy faith Sarah received.\n\nIt’s important to take a moment to really consider what those verbs cost our ancestors. Though Abel’s gift was accepted by God, he was still violently murdered by his brother. Though the ark provided rescue to Noah, he still suffered years of ridicule from his neighbors. Though God kept His promises to Abraham, Abraham still had to walk away from everything he knew and follow God into the desert. As the author of Hebrews says:\n\n“These all died in faith, without having received the promises, but they saw them from a distance, greeted them, and confessed that they were foreigners and temporary residents on earth. Now those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland” (Hebrews 11:13–14).\n\nI think the reason I like Pachinko so much is that it introduces a family seeking a homeland, experiencing rejection in the place where they live. As a Christian, I seek to embrace that same humbleness, embracing the truth that I am a temporary resident here on earth. This is not my final home. For that reason, I can sacrifice it all, including the comfort of home, if that is what God calls me to do. \n\nThese passages prompt me to ask myself: What are the verbs that God is asking me to act out in my life? Can I boldly trust that He will use those actions for His glory, no matter the cost? No matter the ending?\n\nOne thing is certain: God never spoils an ending. And He makes promises I can hold on to while I walk through the middle. I am chosen and never forsaken. God will go with me—He always arrives to the scene first, and acts as my rearguard. God promises He will complete the good work He started in me (Philippians 1:6). He promises that nothing will be wasted, but all things will be restored (Revelation 21:4–5). While I take these steps, any tears I shed will be like liquid words and God promises to read and store them all (Psalm 56:8).\n\nBut this is about more than just me and you. The author of Hebrews says that acts of faith make non-believers turn and watch. In other words, when we put our our faith into action, we create living proof to a dying world that God exists. Our “faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen” (Hebrews 11:1).\n\nThat is no small thing.\n\n",

Oh, and I’d probably already have put in a request for your favorite song to make sure you sing karaoke before the night is over.\n\nRegardless of where you’re going, everyone knows the best way to find the best tips: ask the locals. Your server at dinner will have more insight than any guidebook you read on the plane, and the friend you’re staying with is guaranteed to keep you from going to the restaurants that didn’t live up to their online reviews.\n\nBut when it comes to faith, it’s even more important to have a guide. And when it comes to struggle or not knowing where to turn, the best thing to have on your side is someone who’s been through it before you. And that’s exactly what we’re given in Hebrews 11: examples of people who have lived by faith. “Faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen” (v.1), and yet, God is gracious enough to fill our eyes with hopeful images of our brothers and sisters who have successfully lived by the words He has promised.\n\nWe’re reminded of Abel’s sacrifice, Enoch’s protection, Noah’s motivation, Abraham’s obedience, Sarah’s conception, Isaac’s birth, Jacob’s worship, and Moses’s suffering—“all these were approved through their faith” (v. 39). But we’re given these examples not because we’re supposed to be more like each of these human men and women, but because they, too, were afraid. They, too, were unsure and doubtful and wondering if the things they were putting their trust in were actually real. They, too, hoped their faith was more than just wishful thinking.\n\nInside God’s Word, we get to learn from the locals, those who have gone before us and have seen the goodness and truth of our God in all things. But even better, we see time and time again that their go-to move isn’t to look to their own flesh for answers—it’s to ask their Creator. Their stories invite us to do the same, joining a long, tried-and-true legacy of faith.\n\nThe stories of God’s people point us to His face. May they continue to do so, and may our own stories be marked by faith as well. \n\nKaitlin Wernet is a twenty-something who lives to tell stories with a backbone of hope.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 12:1-13, Romans 12:18-21, 1 Timothy 2:5-6\n\nJesus invited His followers to take up their crosses and follow Him. From the outset of His ministry, He wanted us to know that the Christian life is not free from struggle. The writer of Hebrews encourages believers to “strengthen your tired hands and weakened knees” (Hebrews 12:12). Tired hands and weakened knees are not the result of a life on cruise control; they are the result of labor, opposition, and striving.\n\nSome of us may be all too familiar with this reality. Through trial and tribulation, we’ve become well aware that the way of Jesus isn’t always the smoothest path. Still, in times of plenty there is a tendency to brush over the hardships of faith and tough teachings of Scripture. In a comfortable season of life, we might be tempted to believe that our work as a “good Christian” means that God will bless everything we put our hands to. We can forget that walking in the way of Jesus is not without suffering and that, in Jesus, even our suffering has a redemptive purpose. \n\nListen to this encouragement from Hebrews 12:\n\n“Endure suffering as discipline: God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline? … Furthermore, we had human fathers discipline us, and we respected them. Shouldn’t we submit even more to the Father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time based on what seemed good to them, but he does it for our benefit, so that we can share his holiness. No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it” (vv.7-11).\n\nScripture is clear: God uses everything—struggle and hardship included—for the believer’s good (Romans 8:28). When we assume our way should be easy easy, we forget that Jesus promised the opposite (John 16:33). When we see all pain as a problem to avoid, we miss the opportunity to “rejoice in our afflictions, because we know that affliction produces endurance, endurance produces proven character, and proven character produces hope” (Romans 5:3–4). We miss the opportunity to become more like Christ.\n\nIt’s tempting to go through our places of struggle alone, not wanting God or anyone else to see us at a low point. But when we recognize dark days as an expected part of a life of faith, we can look to the One who has walked this road before. Jesus, our victor and champion, suffered betrayal, persecution, and excruciating death. A “man of sorrows” (Isaiah 53:3), He understands our pain. And He is with us through every hardship when we trust in Him. \n\nWhen your time of suffering comes, look to Jesus. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 12:14-29, Genesis 4:8-13, Isaiah 62:6-12\n\n“You don’t know what you have until it’s gone.” \n\nWe’ve all heard this old adage, or perhaps even experienced the painful truth of it at some point in our own lives. But it’s not really a case of not actually knowing what you had, is it? It’s more a matter of not appreciating that thing, that someone, that blessing—until it’s no longer yours. Maybe you never appreciated it because you never imagined a world in which you’d have to live without it.\n\nSuch is the case with Esau and the oh-so unwise forfeiting of his birthright to his twin brother for the immediate comfort of a home-cooked meal. Whether he truly “despised” his birthright or was merely indifferent to it, Esau did not place great enough importance on his blessing as Isaac’s firstborn son—the blessing that promised both divine protection and authority over other nations (Genesis 25:27–34; 27:29).\n\nWhile the Christians the writer of Hebrews was addressing weren’t merely fighting off hunger pangs, in the face of severe persecution they were tempted to forego their faith in Christ, exchanging the promises of the new covenant for the supposed comfort and familiarity of the old covenant. And so the writer of the book of Hebrews reminds the readers of what’s at stake, comparing the Israelites’ relationship to God at Mt. Sinai under the old covenant of the law (Exodus 19), with the blessings of salvation in Jesus Christ under the new covenant. \n\nThe comparison is a stark one. Their encounter with God at Mt. Sinai left the Israelites, and even Moses, shaken to the core (Hebrews 12:18–21). But that’s not the case for the Hebrew Christians, or for anyone whose faith is in Jesus Christ. \n\n“Instead, [we] have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God… to the assembly of the firstborn whose names have been written in heaven, to a Judge, who is God of all… and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant…” (vv.22–24).\n\nThe old covenant instilled a holy fear in the hearts of God’s people, putting a safe distance between them and God’s holiness. But the new covenant has torn away the veil separating us from God. Christ, our perfect Mediator and Judge (1 Timothy 2:5; 2 Timothy 4:8), put on skin and came down to endure the judgment of our sin. He eliminated the distance between God and His people, bringing us squarely into right and redeemed relationship with Him. “Our God is a consuming fire,” and His sacrificial love for us should should incite awe and reverence in our hearts, not indifference (Hebrews 12:29). \n\nTo know Christ is to be wrapped up in His grace—a hard-won grace that cost us nothing but did not come cheaply. It cost Jesus His life, the agony of bearing the weight of sin for all of humanity for all time and, for the first and only time in history, separation from the Father (Matthew 27:46). The writer of Hebrews is warning readers, cautioning us to not become hardened by persecution or indifferent to Jesus’s sacrifice, to the grace and salvation that can only be found in Him. “Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful” (Hebrews 12:28).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 13:1-25, Joshua 1:5-9, Matthew 25:34-40\n\nAfter thirteen chapters of establishing our great hope and exhorting us to godly living, Hebrews closes with a succinct reminder that all hope comes from Christ who is the “same yesterday, today, and forever” (Hebrews 13:8). The root of all godly living is the person of Christ. He is both our hope and our source of righteousness.\n\nAt the close of the this book, the author recommends a handful of what Matthew Henry calls “excellent duties”: show love and hospitality, care for the mistreated, honor marriage, eschew the love of money, and be satisfied with what you have. This final exhortation to contentment certainly loosens the reins and makes the other excellent duties easier. If one is content, the love of money can’t tempt and the shine of someone prettier or younger doesn’t lure.\n\nHave you ever known someone who is truly content? The author of Hebrews points us first and foremost to the example of Christ. But we are also encouraged to watch the fruit of other leaders and, if that fruit is good, imitate their faith. \n\nThe most contented person I know is Nell. You probably don’t know her; she’s not famous. I met her in college, but she wasn’t the first friend I made. She was quiet and I was so busy making sure everyone knew how much fun I was, I didn’t notice her.\n\nBut once I did notice her, I couldn’t stop. Nell doesn’t push, she doesn’t demand, even though she has stronger opinions than most. But she loves like a fountain, and she is content. These days she homeschools her six children in a small house by a river. She is teaching them the art of contentment by giving them what they need, but not what they demand. She shows them how to be content by being at peace herself. Instead of chasing the world, she has found that her rooms crowded with love hold the very best the world has to offer her.\n\nLight your corner of the world, friends—wherever it may be. And if these excellent duties of love and contentment seem impossible, do not fear; they are impossible. This is why the book of Hebrews was written: to point us always back to our need for Christ. He is our helper, “who promises to never leave us or forsake us” (v.5). \n\nLift your eyes to the eternal glory of Christ, for He is our hope in things both large and small. Any excellence and contentment that flows out of our lives will come from Him. Because of His sanctifying blood, we are made new creatures—creatures capable of hospitality and contentment. Jesus is our hope. He is our strength. And He is the same, yesterday, today, and forever.\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her five little people.

    "devo_title": "How Can We Rejoice in Suffering?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nScripture Reading: James 1:1-18, Jeremiah 31:7-14, Matthew 4:1-11, 1 Peter 1:6-7\n\nHave you ever noticed how in times of pain or trial, we comfort our friends, loved ones, and even ourselves, with words like:\n\n“You’re going to make it through this.”\n\n“Tomorrow will be better.”\n\n“What can I do to ease your pain?”\n\nOur endgame is an end to suffering. We pray for the bad times to go away. We beg that they would never come at all. A whole industry of mylar balloons and teddy bears exists bearing the sentiment, “Get Well Soon!” We ask the Lord to remove our thorns, to help us endure our hardships, and to bring us through suffering as unscathed as possible. \n\nBut Jesus’ brother James, the author of this short letter, has an entirely different take on trials.\n\n“Consider it a great joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you experience various trials.”\n– James 1:2\n\nDon’t get over them. Don’t rush through them or past them. Rejoice in them.\n\nJames tells us not to be so hasty to escape the faith-testing valleys because those valleys contain the fertile soil needed to produce steadfastness. And steadfastness—being immovable, unable to be shaken, deeply rooted—is perhaps the true “wellness” we should be seeking. \n\nAs Christians, we eagerly say we want to be like Christ. But many of us are really only asking for the good stuff. “Lord, make us loving and patient and joyful!” we sing in chorus and with enthusiasm. \n\nJesus was indeed all of those things, but He was also described by the prophet Isaiah as “a man of suffering who knew what sickness was” (Isaiah 53:3). Christ Himself learned obedience through His suffering (Hebrews 5:8). And so it is for us. It is from those dark yet fertile valleys that steadfastness begins to spring forth—first sprouting from faith, then budding into love, and flowering into patience and joy.\n\nToday, or tomorrow, or whenever you find yourself in a place of trial—do not minimize it or rush through it. Instead, give thanks to the Lord. Pray for endurance and steadfastness from the One who has already endured and proven Himself steadfast. \n\nAs backwards as it may feel, this difficult trial or painful suffering is a time to thank the Lord. This is the time to rejoice.\n\nWe do not rejoice because bad things happen, or because this poor, fallen world is full of death, injustice, and sorrow. No. We rejoice because the sovereign Lord calls us His own. He loves us enough to descend with us into the dark yet mysteriously fertile valleys, to produce in us a steadfastness which cannot be shaken.\n\nThanks be to God.\n\n“Blessed is the one who endures trials, because when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.”\n– James 1:12\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Both Hearing and Doing",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: James 1:19-27, Proverbs 10:19, Ephesians 4:26-27, Romans 5:20\n\nI’ve always been a little uncomfortable while getting my hair cut. Perhaps it’s my nervousness that I’ve directed my stylist the wrong way, or that the color we picked won’t work at all with my skin tone. But beyond the anxiety that comes from letting someone else take control for a few hours, there’s a measured amount of discomfort that comes from looking at myself in the mirror for that long. \n\nEvery blemish seems to glow under the lights of my local salon. My eyebrows seem significantly more unruly than I thought they had become, and the makeup I had so carefully applied hours ago has mostly melted away, revealing the oh-so-telling dark circles under my very tired eyes. \n\nAnd yet when I leave, somehow I always feel so much better. I’ve been transformed—or at least my hair has. \n\nIt is transformation and the confidence that comes with it that James is urging us to seek through the reading of the Word. Of course, it’s much less superficial and quite a bit harder than sitting in a salon chair. James tells us that when we hear the Word of God and don’t act, then we are just like a man sitting in front of a mirror, seeing all his blemishes and yet walking away without caring, without doing anything. \n\nIf looking in the mirror is hard, looking deep into the Word of God is harder— especially when reading James’s words. They reflect back to me my own anger, my quickness to speak, my moral failures, my pride. \n\nBut being transformed by the Word means becoming a doer, not just a hearer. It means inviting the Holy Spirit to carve out those ugly places and fill them with the righteousness that Jesus gives, so that I might live out what James calls a “pure and undefiled religion” (1:27). The Word becomes more than a book to me; it is a means of grace, a tool of the Spirit’s sanctifying work in my heart. \n\nJesus said it this way: \n\n“Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.  And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.  And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.  And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”\n– Matthew 7:24-27\n\nJesus is the Word made flesh, sent to dwell among us. We are called to look daily not into a mirror, but into the Word—into the very face of Jesus. \n\nThe gospel-filled life Christ calls us to is not one full of quick and angry words, self-serving pride, or self-sufficiency, but of sacrificial love and humility. We are called to let the Word do its work inside us—to read it daily with fresh eyes as it, by the Holy Spirit, reads our hearts and transforms us, making us more and more like Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Mercy Triumphs Over Judgment",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Vivian Mabuni\n\nScripture Reading: James 2:1-13, Zechariah 7:9-10, Matthew 7:1-5, Romans 13:8-10\n\nWith the precision of a surgeon’s knife, the Holy Spirit sliced into my heart, convicting me. It caught me off guard—my sin of favoritism.\n\nHours before, I’d watched a video on discrimination alongside my ministry team. The clip highlighted how easily we can fall into judging and favoring others. To further illustrate the point, we were divided into two different groups based on one aspect of our lives, something we had no control over: our eye color. People with blue eyes were to be treated differently than those with brown eyes.  \n\nSoon comments and accusations were flying back and forth. The responses of those discriminated against felt strangely satisfying to me. One woman in particular spoke with such disdain; her condescending attitude only proved her lack of awareness of those who live in the margins every day. I confess I was happy to have her sit in the back of the room as a member of the “discriminated” group, so she could experience a lack of equity. \n\nThe next day, our group entered into a time of prayer, confession, and lament. That’s when God opened my eyes in a new way to Galatians chapter five, where Paul lists the works of the flesh: enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy. The very things our team had sought to address and combat head-on were now being revealed in my own heart. I had judged that woman, and in thinking less of her, I showed partiality toward others who appeared more self-aware and further along in their faith journey. \n\n“My brothers and sisters, do not show favoritism as you hold on to the faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ… haven’t you made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?”\n– James 2:1,4\n\nThis sin—my sin of judging some and favoring others—is cautioned against throughout Scripture. In His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus couldn’t be more clear when He says, “Do not judge, so that you won’t be judged. For you will be judged by the same standard with which you judge others, and you will be measured by the same measure you use” (Matthew 7:1-2).\n\nThe Lord is the only one worthy of being the Judge. He’s the only one capable of judging fairly. “For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7). It’s not our job to do the work of the Holy Spirit in convicting others of their sin, but we are called to respond to the Spirit’s conviction in our own hearts.\n\nWhen we try to take God’s place as judge and jury, perhaps it’s because we’ve lost sight of just how great a debt Jesus died to pay on our behalf. Now, God’s “mercy triumphs over judgment” (James 2:13); His justice has been satisfied once and for all who love Jesus (Romans 3:25-26). \n\nWe’re all on a journey, learning to honor the Lord through loving one another well. Daily, as we walk in step with the Spirit, may we speak the gospel into our waking moments. As sin is exposed, let us draw near to our Savior. Mercy triumphed over judgment when Christ died for us, sinners, and rescued us from deserved condemnation. And mercy triumphs still, as a holy God looks at us and sees the spotless image of His Son.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Faith Made Complete",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: James 2:14-26, Deuteronomy 6:4-5, Romans 3:23-26, Ephesians 2:8-10\n\nFor it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n\nI love that Christian freedom is based on this principle: free, radical grace exists for the undeserving through Jesus. There’s nothing we can do to receive it; there’s nothing we can do to reverse it. Incredible, wonderful, scandalous grace.\n\nThat’s why reading James’ words can feel confusing. Is he contradicting grace, saying we’re justified by our works—that without those good works, our faith is as good as dead?\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time grappling with these passages, asking God to open my eyes to what He was saying through these two disciples. On the surface, it seems like they are contradicting one another. Then He reminded me of a breakfast I shared with a friend recently. \n\nI’ve known this friend since I was ten years old. She’s gorgeous, extremely athletic, and was always popular in school. Over the twenty years we’ve known each other, we’ve stayed loosely in touch. Over coffee and eggs, she shared the circumstances of her life—mostly that it hadn’t turned out like she’d planned. \n\nAs we talked, I felt God pressing me to speak. It felt strange, so I hesitated, afraid of sounding cheesy or trite. I knew things between us could get awkward. But then I didn’t really feel like I had a choice. So I said it: \n\n“I don’t know why, but I really feel like God wants me to tell you that He loves you.” \n\nI cringed after saying it, wondering if I’d gone too far. But in that moment, something softened. Tears fell down her cheeks. Rather than turning awkward, the entire moment felt sacred. \n\nHebrews chapter 11 recounts the spiritual giants whose faith in God was counted as righteousness. But that faith wasn’t void of action. A quick perusal of the list and you’ll see it over and over again: verbs.\n\nBy faith Abel offered.\n\nBy faith Noah built.\n\nBy faith Abraham obeyed.\n\nOur God is a God of action. So if you have faith in Him, get ready to move. \n\nThis is the beauty of Christianity: our faith in Jesus saves us, and it also frees us from striving to be enough, trying to earn approval, stature, or recognition through what we do. I can do good works without having to worry about measuring the outcome. Faith in Jesus’ final, finished work gives me the security to do good without worrying that I’m doing enough.\n\nThis is where it gets crazy. My friend called me a few weeks later to tell me something had radically changed in her heart. From that moment we shared at the breakfast table, she’d felt God in hot pursuit of her. Since then, she’s been spending every morning in His Word, falling in love with Him again. \n\nIs it possible God can use us like that? Is it possible that I’d just experienced a good work He’d prepared for me in advance, one He’d planned for me to do all along? After all, the work isn’t really mine. I’m just His workmanship (Ephesians 2:10). I’m an instrument in His hands, playing an essential part in His eternal symphony. \n\nWhat a gift. \n\nTo be saved by grace.\n\nTo be invited into God’s work.\n\nTo see that, in the end, it’s all His.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Controlling the Tongue",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: James 3:1-12, Genesis 1:26-27, Psalm 12, Matthew 12:36-37\n\nThe idea of “controlling the tongue” is not just religious-speak to me. It is not just a heading in my Bible or a topic that generates good, honest conversation at a Bible study. It is one of the most sincere prayers of my heart and one of the darkest manifestations of my sin.\n\nEspecially since becoming a mother, I’ve realized my words have the power to give life and hope or to steal them away. I’ll never forget the look in my young daughter’s eyes the first time I tossed sharp, careless words at her like a grenade and saw her wince at the explosion. I surrendered my tongue and its words to the Lord that day, and I’ve surrendered them countless times since.\n\nIn chapter 3, James describes the tongue as the epitome of hypocrisy. “With the tongue we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in God’s likeness” (James 3:9). And here’s the kicker: We are all guilty of this—every one of us, in every phase of life.\n\nJames does not give us a tidy “how-to” at the end of this passage, no foolproof answer for ending this struggle which takes place in each of us. Instead, he provides one analogy after the other, illustrating the way our words can bring life and direction, or death and destruction.\n\n“So too, though the tongue is a small part of the body, it boasts great things. Consider how a small fire sets ablaze a large forest” (v. 5).\n\nOur words have more power than we usually care to acknowledge. If we knew—really knew—the weight our words carry in each person who receives them, how would that change what we say? Would the flames of hypocrisy overcome us if we could see the fires we spark?\n\nThis forthright passage from James should bring us to our knees. Our struggle to control our tongues and rein in our thoughts should cause us to plead to the Father for wisdom in how to honor Him and build up others with our words. This is just what James encourages us to do in the first chapter of his letter: \n\n“Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God—who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly—and it will be given to him” (James 1:5).\n\nPraise God that He hears us! \n\nJust as grace pours into the darkest parts of our hearts, igniting the hope of the gospel, so does His grace pour over the fires we start with our words. The hope of Jesus and the forgiveness of the Father extend to this place, too. As a woman who’s flung more sparks than I care to admit, I am so incredibly thankful.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Wisdom from Above",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: James 3:13-18, Proverbs 11:18, Romans 12:9-21, Galatians 5:22-23, Hebrews 12:11\n\nYou could fill an entire library with all the bad dating advice heard around the world. As early as elementary school, girls are told to change their style or personality to woo a crush. In high school, magazines tell girls to pretend to laugh at his jokes or play hard to get. Even in our twenties, thirties, and beyond, the barrage of bad dating advice from media, friends, and professionals is inescapable. Advice rooted in jealousy, insecurity, and selfishness has engulfed our culture.\n\nWe’ve all sought advice from the world, whether on dating or some other aspect of life. We all face experiences that challenge and confuse us—they’re often the moments that grow us the most. As James says from the very beginning of his book, the trials of life produce maturity (1:2-4). But where we choose to turn with our questions when we’ve lost our way can dramatically change the course of our journey.\n\nAs a counselor, people often turn to me for advice and wisdom while in the throes of crisis. And the truth is, I don’t have all the answers or the perfect advice for every person. Thankfully, my work is more about supporting people along their journey, rather than telling them which steps to take. The desire for clarity isn’t wrong, but there is only one all-knowing and perfect Counselor—and it sure isn’t me.  \n\nWe need to be careful whom we trust to speak into our lives. Hear me on this: it is immeasurably valuable to open your life up to guidance from your trusted church community. But we need to remember that all of us are broken vessels, imperfectly reflecting the image of God. The Lord speaks through people (Matthew 10:20), but we must weigh the words of others with the help of the Holy Spirit to discern what God Himself is saying.\n\nJames does not take the matter of bad advice lightly, going as far as to call it demonic (James 3:15). Why is it such a big deal? Because bad advice can wound people and even destroy lives. There is a sharp distinction between wisdom from above, and wisdom from below. Knowing how serious the consequences can be, we need to be careful with both the counsel we take and the counsel we give. \n\nThankfully, James describes what godly “wisdom from above” looks like. Wisdom from God is “pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering without pretense” (3:17). \n\nInterestingly, those descriptions don’t sound anything like the most “influential” voices in our culture. But is there anyone that does come to mind when you read James’s description of wisdom? Those are the people we ought to turn to for advice, the people we should hope to grow more like over time. \n\nOf course, the life of Christ is the ultimate example of godly wisdom in action. If anyone knows what it is like to face trials, it’s Jesus before the cross. And ultimately who does He seek for comfort and wisdom but His Father? (Luke 22:39-43). This is God’s best for us too.\n\nIn times of crisis and pain, when we’re looking for direction, may our hearts learn to hear the instruction of the Holy Spirit. May we seek first the wisdom of our Heavenly Father. Even now, He longs to be gracious to us, to generously give us wisdom when we ask Him for it (Isaiah 30:18; James 1:5). We’ll know it’s from Him because true wisdom from above carries with it the sweet aroma of gentleness and peace.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: James 4:1-12, Psalm 9:19, John 4:23-24, Galatians 1:10, 1 John 5:13-15\n\nI remember the last time that I humbled myself before the Lord. I didn’t really have a choice. I woke up before the sun, an hour from home, stared at the ceiling, and writhed in the sheets, trying to get out of my own skin. I didn’t want to be me anymore. “Me” had screwed everything up. I wanted to be someone else, or find a way to go back in time and undo all the wrong I had done.\n\nI wanted to start over.\n\nIf I could just go back to the beginning of the year. Or, no, the beginning of last year. Really, if I could go back to before college, that would be best. Or, possibly back to childhood. I was happy then, right? Maybe back then I was okay. I turned to punch my pillow. I know I can never go back far enough. I am who I am. Because of sin, there wasn’t a specific moment in time when things started to wrong. And that is humbling.\n\nI eventually got out of bed and got in my car to drive home. There was an accident on the highway—the kind that makes you put your car in park. I screamed and slammed the steering wheel and didn’t care who saw me in the next lane. The car was pointed home, but I didn’t know where I was going. I just needed to be alone with God and scream at Him and apologize to Him and beg for His forgiveness. Every twenty minutes or so, my mom called to check in on me. She knew I was in a dark night of the soul. “Keep screaming,” she said. “All God requires of us is to acknowledge we have done wrong and turn around.”\n\nThose words had never touched my soul so deeply. \n\nThis is the truth: The world seduces us with its material goods, its experiences, its flushes of beauty and its moments of lust. When we’re proud, we walk along that destructive path, trying to feign confidence. We fill our hands with the world’s pleasures, but like sand, it falls through our fingers. We dig and dig, but in the end, we’re left dirty and empty-handed. All the castles we build are eventually swept away.\n\nHumility is admitting the truth: I have nothing. That’s what I screamed to God in the car. That’s what James wants us to shout to the Lord, too. And thankfully, beautifully, God stands arms open wide, ready for us to turn to Him. He holds our hand when we let go of everything else.\n\nDo you know what’s amazing about this kind of humility? Letting go of the world actually gives us the power—God’s power—and strength to live in this world. It’s a paradox. When we put our entire identity in God, we are no longer slaves to the world’s trends or its approval. We can stand up for justice, at the risk of looking foolish. We can endure ridicule, rather than fight for our reputation. When we have humbled ourselves before God, we don’t need the world’s applause, because our treasure is in heaven.\n\nThank God for humility. And thank God that when we finally, finally, fall to our knees, screaming and ugly-crying before Him, He comes to lift us up.\n\nPunch a pillow today, friend. Tell God the truth about who you are. He already knows. Still He waits for you. He longs to hold you, even though you have nothing but yourself to give.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melissa Zaldivar\n\nScripture Reading: James 4:13-17, Proverbs 27:1, Acts 18:19-21, 1 Corinthians 5:6-8\n\nThe other morning I sat down and thumbed through some old journals from earlier in my 20s. (Incidentally, if you want a good laugh, go back to another season in life and read about what was important to you then.) Sometimes I mentioned an upcoming event or trip or a boy or some kind of debacle that I’d found myself in. But I always had some kind of a plan in motion.\n\nThe trend started early. I once found a to-do list from when I was about eight years old that included “play outside for 1.5 hours.” Because childhood is way more fun when you plan it.\n\nTo this day, my tendency to plan is in full effect. Each and every day starts off with a to-do list of what I want to accomplish. I even add the tasks I’ve already finished, just for the satisfaction of checking them off ‘the list.’ Anyone else?\n\nMy junior year of college, some of my dearest and I planned a retreat to the suburbs of Chicago. As we pulled onto the freeway, I was in the passenger seat in charge of navigation, giving me the much-appreciated perception of control. So you can imagine my surprise when I looked up from my map to see the car in front of us at a full stop—while we cruised along in pace with the rest of the highway. \n\nWhat happened next felt so slow that I can remember every moment, but it was, in reality, mere seconds. Everything became eerily silent. My last thought before impact was, You’re about to be in a car accident. \n\nCome now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will travel to such and such a city and spend a year there and do business and make a profit.” Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring—what your life will be! For you are like vapor that appears for a little while, then vanishes.\n– James 4:13-14\n\n Nothing prepares you for a crash. For the smell of exhaust. The sound of bending metal and shattering glass. The taste of airbag dust. The shock.\n\nAs things settled, I leaned my shoulder into the car door and stepped out of the wreckage into the stopped, shocked traffic, the Chicago skyline rising up around me. I brushed the airbag dust off of my shirt and cheeks and took a few shaky steps. For months, I would wrestle with the crash in my dreams as I waded through the feeling of helplessness.\n\nIt’s inevitable. We get phone calls or texts or emails that stop us dead in our tracks. The devastating news comes—on-screen, in a letter, or across someone else’s lips. Or maybe, like me, you’ve witnessed or experienced something horrific, something tragic or traumatic. Suddenly, your plans get pushed aside and those to-do lists get burned. You’re left raw and broken, trying to catch your breath.\n\nThat’s the moment when you remember the truth: you’re not the one upholding anything. You remember not to “boast about tomorrow, for you don’t know what a day might bring” (Proverbs 27:1). Christ alone holds all things together (Colossians 1:17).\n\nTomorrow could bring beauty; it could bring heartache. But as I’ve been reminded, even in my darkest moments, Christ holds me fast. Each moment is laced with His grace.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: James 5:1-6, Matthew 5:38-42, Hebrews 10:35-39, Revelation 20:11-15\n\nMy husband and I were on our way to a dinner party, when we cut through a neighborhood on the nice side of town. As we drove the luxurious streets, we stared out our windows at the soaring homes with custom architecture and perfectly manicured lawns. Each house looked like the perfect place to live, its own little heaven on earth. We drove in silence, until my husband turned to me and laughingly apologized, “I’m sorry I’m a pastor.”\n\nThis is a running joke between us, though I can’t help but detect a hint of truth in his voice. We have every single thing we need, and more, but that doesn’t stop comparison from knocking on our door. On more days than I care to admit, I peek over the fence into my neighbor’s greener pasture, and I yearn for it. \n\nDeep down, my husband and I both know that “more” will never scratch the itch of envy. More money, more house, more things will not relieve the pain—and the lie—of comparison. It’s a bottomless pit of need, with endless demands which are never satisfied. We know this, but we also need reminding. \n\nThis is the gift of James 5, which reminds us what is true about all our pretty possessions. Preached with the same fire-bellied conviction as the Old Testament prophets, James has harsh words for wealthy people who misuse their riches. According to New Testament scholar Douglas Moo, James is not targeting all wealthy people, but those who put their wealth to unrighteous ends. Or, those who are simply stingy with it. For those believers, James reserves his harshest judgments.\n\nHowever, James has a more universal message too. Whether we have wealth or we don’t, whether we misuse our money or we don’t, our possessions amount to very little. Drawing on earlier biblical imagery of moth and rust (Matthew 6:19), James reminds us that even our finest earthly possessions will one day be gone. Their Kingdom weight is slight. Their investment yields even less. Money and possessions cannot, and will not, give us what we want. \n\nSo, how do we escape the wretched emptiness this passage describes? \n\nFirst, feed on God, not things. Our pursuit of possessions is a lot like trying to satisfy deep hunger by eating a single lettuce leaf. It will not fill us. Our appetites can only be satisfied by the “bread of life,” Jesus Christ, who promises, “No one who comes to me will ever be hungry, and no one who believes in me will ever be thirsty again” (John 6:35).\n\nSecond, be generous. Too often, we resolve not to love our possessions too much, a mindset that is well-intentioned but without accountability or discernibility. The world will only know we hold our possessions loosely if we actually hold them loosely. This is why Jesus exhorts us to radical acts of generosity (Matthew 5:40-42). Jesus commands this, not simply because it’s a “nice thing to do,” but because it sets our hearts—and, therefore, our feet—on a different path, away from the destruction James describes. \n\nThese are truths we must speak over ourselves again and again. The sparkle and shine of worldly goods are a powerful illusion, but the more we return to these biblical truths, the more they will start to sink in. \n\nNow, whenever my husband apologizes for what we cannot afford, I turn to him and smile to say, “You know what, they don’t have anything we don’t already have in Christ.” \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: James 5:7-20, Joel 2:23, Matthew 5:33-37, Hebrews 11:32-40, 1 Peter 4:7-11\n\nWhen I see the word “patience” listed in Galatians 5, along with the other fruit of the Spirit, I groan. I’m reading happily along with love, joy, and peace, and then… patience. Ugh.\n\nI know I’m not patient. Watch me try to fold a fitted sheet. But patience, as talked about in the Bible, is much more than remaining calm in the midst of fitted-sheet frustration.\n\nTake the new believers in the book of James as an example. These people were Jews recently converted to Christianity. Because of their new beliefs, they were rejected by their own people. They were persecuted by everyone around them, and James tells them to do what? \n\n“You also must be patient.”\n– James 5:8\n\nThe Greek word often used for patience in Scripture is makrothumeo, which means… well, it means words that make me uncomfortable, such as:\n\nLongsuffering\n\nSlowness in avenging wrongs\n\nSteadfastness\n\nForbearance.\n\nPatience is much deeper than something you practice when someone is hogging the bathroom. Patience—the longsuffering kind of patience—is something that arises when real trial strikes.\n\nA few months ago, my own longsuffering was tested. I wish I could tell you I turned to God, fully trusting Him during this dark time, but no. Instead, I shook my fist, and I shook it hard. I was angry at God, and I tried desperately to escape the anxiety and darkness by my own means.\n\nYou could say I was the opposite of longsuffering. I was short-suffering, tiny-suffering, microscopic-suffering. I realized in those few months that my pain threshold is nearly nonexistent and, even still, I know most of you reading this have weathered much worse. My life was not bearing the fruit of patience because somewhere deep down inside of me I didn’t trust my God. And somewhere even deeper inside of me, I had lost hope and convinced myself I was alone.\n\nBut there’s an amazing thing about the word longsuffering in the New Testament: it is almost always an instruction given in the context of hope.\n\nRomans 8 says, “For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together with labor pains until now. . . We ourselves who have the Spirit as the firstfruits—we also groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies” (vv. 22-23).\n\nAnd in Galatians 6:9, we’re told, “So we must not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don’t give up.”\n\nWe groan. But we don’t give up. Better still, we do not wait without hope! \n\nWe do not wait in vain. We wait for our God—the God who has promised and secured our full redemption through Jesus Christ.\n\nMay we do the same for each other in the face of our trials. Let’s practice longsuffering together. Let’s look at our lives with an eye to that glorious day in the future when suffering is but a long, forgotten memory of this earth.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nI have sepia-toned memories of wearing a pillowcase veil, grabbing a handful of dandelions, and marching my scrawny, little-girl legs down a grassy aisle, pretending to be a bride. To six-year-old me, the wait for my real wedding seemed impossibly long, but that didn’t stop me from actively hoping the day would eventually come. Nearly forty years of hindsight reveals that the gap between the hope and the reality was itty bitty. All too soon, I’d traded in cotton for tulle and weeds for roses in the blink of an eye.\n\nSo it is with the promises of Christ. Here, in the first chapter of 1 Peter, the apostle reminds us of our “living hope” (v.3). He doesn’t leave us guessing about what we’re hoping for. Through the resurrection of Christ, we have gained: rebirth and a salvation ready to be revealed, as well as an imperishable, undefiled, unfading inheritance (vv.3–5).\n\nLike a little girl trying to picture her future groom, these promises can look a little fuzzy around the edges. Yes, Christ has saved us, and He is changing us even now, but so much of our hope is in what’s been stored up for us in the future, or as Peter reminds us, what’s being “kept in heaven” for us (v.4).\n\nWe have a storehouse of hope. It is the ultimate trust fund, a hope chest full of the promises of God. While we have yet to see our God face to face, we’ve been given the gift of faith to believe in Him, know Him, and love Him now. And we “rejoice with inexpressible and glorious joy,” because even as we await His return, we are receiving the goal of [our] faith, the salvation of [our] souls” (vv.8–9).\n\nOurs is a living and active hope in a living and active God, who has unfathomable blessings in store for His bride. And yet, there are days, lots of them, when our living hope seems to be doing little more than gathering dust. Peter alluded to this early on. We are the “chosen, living as exiles” (v.1). We are chosen, yet sometimes unpopular in this world, never quite at home here. Sometimes our very cells seem to groan for more.\n\nWhen will we know what it’s like to be made new, fully shedding the broken version of ourselves? How long until the Lord shows His hand, demystifying the “salvation ready to be revealed in the last time”? (v.5). How much longer until we can open the hope chest to touch and feel our imperishable inheritance?\n\nIt will happen in the blink of an eye.\n\nYou are being guarded by God’s power through faith for salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. You rejoice in this, even though now for a short time, if necessary, you suffer grief in various trials (vv.5–6).\n\nThe gap between this present moment and future glory may seem impossibly large. Still we rejoice. Because we have a hope kept in heaven that can never be destroyed. One day we will trade in the suffering of these “various trials” for the many gifts God has tucked away for us.\n\nIt won’t be long now.\n\nThat is why, among the people of God, hope will always be alive and well.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nThe list of things I know for certain is short, but I know this: I am not holy.\n\nI hear Peter’s charge to “be holy in all your conduct” (1 Peter 1:15) as he echoes the Lord’s words to “be holy, because I am holy” (Leviticus 11:44), and I feel the gravitational pull of defeat. Because it doesn’t seem to matter how much I want to be holy. (And trust me—I really, really want to be holy). There aren’t twelve steps I can take to become holy. There aren’t bootstraps big enough to pull me up toward the perfection of God. There’s no self-help guide to blamelessness. If personal holiness is up to me, it begins to feel like an impossible equation.\n\nThere are times when I get fed up with chronically missing the mark. I want to be holy because God is holy, but instead find myself broken because the world is broken. I was having one of these fed-up moments while driving down the highway recently. In my frustration I cried out to the Lord, praying, “How long, Lord, until I become like you?!”\n\nThis phrase came to mind; “In a moment.”\n\nFor a nanosecond I worried I was about to hit a semi head on, because I know I will not fully become like Christ this side of heaven. But no collision came. My heart was simply recalling the gospel hope I cling to. Scripture tells us that when Christ returns, we will be changed “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye” (1 Corinthians 15:52).\n\nPeter isn’t tasking us with a moral standard our broken selves can never attain. He’s preaching the gospel. We can’t hear it too often. He reminds us of what’s truest about us as Christ-followers:\n\nFor you know that you were redeemed from your empty way of life inherited from your fathers, \n\nnot with perishable things like silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, \n\nlike that of an unblemished and spotless lamb (1 Peter 1:18–19).\n\nYes, I am broken as my parents were broken.\n\nMy children are broken, as I am broken.\n\nYou are broken, as all people are broken.\n\nBut that is not our story, and it’s not our identity.\n\nOur brokenness and Christ’s holiness are two sides of the same gospel coin. And so we need to stop staring at our failed attempts at holiness. We need to flip the coin over, and instead gaze with wonder anew at the gospel of grace. Again, we cannot do it too often.\n\nMy power over sin rests not in me, but in the one who burst forth from the grave (v.21), the “holy, holy, holy” One (Revelation 4:8). I am holy, because Christ is holy, and I am hidden in Him (Colossians 3:3). Yes, my flesh is broken. But praise be to God, “All flesh is like grass and its glory like the flower of grass” (1 Peter 1:24).\n\nBut the holiness of God is mine forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nHaley and I sat down at a picnic table. Her four young children ran to the playground.\n\n“So what do you want to know?” she asked. I took in a deep breath and looked at my notes. Where to begin?\n\nEarlier that year, I’d begun interviewing female veterans as research for a novel. Tall and blonde with striking blue eyes, Haley was dressed in casual jeans and a tee-shirt. You would never guess that just a few years ago, she had been deployed to Afghanistan, leading an engineering platoon.\n\nWhile they were deployed, she told me, her platoon built outposts for incoming NATO troops. Every few weeks, she and a group of 20 soldiers would travel to a remote location in the desert, where they’d construct wood platforms, assemble huge Army-green tents, and dig a trench as a temporary latrine. While they worked, an infantry unit provided security around the perimeter. They had to build quickly; the opposition was everywhere.\n\nThe image of Haley holding a hammer in the middle of enemy territory comes to mind as I read today’s passage. After all, Jesus calls us to begin constructing the kingdom of God here on earth—even though we will face resistance.\n\nPeter wrote his letters to a specific population of Christians who lived just before Roman Emperor Nero’s brutal persecution of the church, which began in 64 A.D. At the time, Christians experienced slander, ridicule, and discrimination from their neighbors. They were facing opposition on all sides, and Peter knew that the pressure was only going to get worse.\n\nBut in the midst of a dire situation, there was hope. Peter leans on a construction metaphor, explaining that they were being built up, like “living stones” into a spiritual house (v.5). And the resistance? The rejection? The reviling? None of that would come as a surprise to Jesus. He warned His followers that they would face persecution, opposition, and even open hatred (John 16:33). He knew they would face these things, because when you build a new kingdom in the middle of enemy territory, the enemy takes aim.\n\nAt the heart of this passage is a call to keep building—even if we’re afraid, even if it’s hard. (Perhaps especially if it’s hard.) I am a builder in the midst of enemy territory. So are you. There might be differences among us—race, age, nationality, background—and yet, our shared identity as Christ-followers gives us the freedom to stand side-by-side, raising our hammers together, participating in the construction of the kingdom of God.\n\nWhen the hammer gets heavy, 1 Peter 2:10 stands as a reminder: “Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people; you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.” And Jesus? He is our cornerstone, the first piece of the foundation and the rock upon which the whole structure rests. Without Him, it would all fall apart.\n\nKeep building the spiritual house in the midst of this world. Do not grow weary. It may seem futile at times, but all our building is not in vain. With Jesus as our cornerstone, we are the beginnings of a city that will endure forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nInjustice of any kind is hard to bear. When I’m on the receiving end of hate, my natural inclination is to defend myself. To fight back. I have little strength to shoulder the weight of false accusations, unfair treatment, or slights on my character. And yet, that’s exactly what the passage in 1 Peter 2 is asking me to do: put down my rights and “submit to every human institution” (v.13).\n\nBefore we continue, it’s important to address the part of this passage that tells slaves to submit to their masters. The Greek word used here refers to household or domestic servants who would’ve also been slaves. Slavery in the first century was different than the American version of race-based slavery of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Peter is not advocating for slavery as a system. He is instead dealing with it as a reality that some of the recipients of his letter lived under. For our purposes, it’s best to read this passage with the phrase “lowly workers” in mind. Peter was instructing Christians to endure their pain with grace.\n\nPeter would know. On more than one occasion, an oppressive government imprisoned him for his beliefs and preaching. He would eventually be crucified. In that place of oppression, he continued preaching the gospel, trusting that God would use every ounce of his suffering for the good of the world. He submitted to the path that God had paved for him, even though that path included hardship.\n\nIf you cringe at the word “submission,” you’re in good company. Submission is extremely counter-cultural in our “YOLO” society. An acronym short for you only live once, YOLO is a rallying cry that places happiness as the ultimate aim of life. If we only have this one life to live, we might as well make it a great, fun, exciting one, right? I have to admit, it’s a pretty attractive philosophy. But it stands at complete odds with Christianity.\n\nWe also live in a society that rails against injustice with ever-increasing outrage. Police brutality, racial bias in our judicial system, gender wage gaps, sexual abuse and harassment in the workplace—these are serious problems, constantly dominating my news feeds. But the problem with focusing all of my attention and outrage on the world’s ills is that I can so easily lose sight of my own sin. I begin to want change out there far more than I desire change in my own heart.\n\nRather than focus his eyes on the injustice leveraged against him, Peter chose to focus on the injustices he’d perpetrated against God, forgiven by Jesus’s blood. He knew the truth: Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection replaces our temporary perspective with an eternal one.\n\nHe himself bore our sins in his body on the tree; \n\nso that, having died to sins, we might live for righteousness (1 Peter 2:24).\n\nAs a Christ-follower, you’re not only going to live once—you’re going to live forever. Discomfort, pain, and injustice are real, but they are fleeting when compared to the glory and love of our Savior. I’d rather serve Jesus than my own happiness. And I can trust Jesus to use the injustices I see around me for the good of His kingdom.\n\nHow do I know this? Because He suffered a sham trial, a wrongful conviction, and bloody death—on my behalf. And thank God He did. Jesus transformed the ultimate injustice into the world’s greatest good.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nJust before Thanksgiving, Patrick asked my father for his blessing to propose. An Army Colonel who’d spent nearly 30 years serving in the U.S. Military, my father has all the outward trappings of intimidation. Patrick braced for the third degree. Instead, my father laughed, shrugged, and smiled.\n\n“You’re both smart,” he said. “If Claire wants to marry you, then you have my blessing.” Before Patrick could breathe easy, my father put up one finger as if he’d just remembered something important.\n\n“You know, Claire has a tendency to want to take charge,” he said.\n\nWay to go dad. I can’t blame him for saying that—it’s true. I do have a tendency to want to take charge. For that reason, reading this passage is difficult. It’s easy to read verses about how God loves me. It’s hard to read about what God expects of me. But deep down I know the passages of Scripture that make me most uncomfortable are likely the passages I need to engage with the most.\n\nWhen I read this passage the first time, all I could think about were women who’ve been mistreated, oppressed, and abused by men who have used these Scriptures to justify their abhorrent behavior. But Peter isn’t writing this passage for society at large. He’s telling individual women to submit to their own husbands, not for all women everywhere to be subordinate to men in general.\n\nIf my father’s first warning weren’t enough, nine years of marriage have likely taught my husband that my ability to submit isn’t my best quality. Whenever there’s a decision to be made, my knee-jerk reaction is to grab the reins—not out of kindness, but out of pride and fear. My desire for control is more powerful than my desire for deeper marital connection. All the while, the world tells me that I can be superwoman, have it all, remain young-looking, and raise a family. Soon, my hands are full of reins, but my heart is empty of peace. God invites me into a new way of living. The new way is slower, quieter. Because God loves me, I can trust that obeying His guidance won’t lead to more harm but, ultimately, to His blessing.\n\nAt the end of the previous chapter, Peter outlined Jesus’s suffering and sacrifice on the cross. He begins this chapter with these words: “In the same way, wives submit yourselves to your own husbands” (v.1). Peter then calls husbands to do the same, especially taking in to account the societal norms of the day, which saw women as “weaker” and less than their male counterparts. He instructs:\n\nIn the same way, you husbands must give honor to your wives. Treat your wife with understanding as you live together. She may be weaker than you are, but she is your equal partner in God’s gift of new life (v.7).\n\nJesus gave us a model for sacrificial love. And if we’re following His model, we cannot be surprised when loving well is sometimes hard and messy; it may cost us something in return. Jesus put down His rights in order to grant us access to the kingdom of God. In the same way, we’re called to put down our own need for control, trusting His ways are best.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nThe year was 1967. Crowds had gathered outside the Pentagon to protest the ongoing Vietnam War. Members of the 503rd Military Police Battalion formed a semi-circle and pointed their rifles toward the protestors. It was a tense moment, in a tense era, in a tense world.\n\nBut then hope seemed to break right through the moment, as a young man stepped forward to place carnations inside the officers’ barrels. American photographer, Bernie Boston, captured the moment in a shot entitled, “Flower Power.” The photograph moved the nation so profoundly, it earned Boston a nomination for the Pulitzer Prize, and the ethos of an entire generation was captured and preserved.\n\nWhatever your political beliefs, as Christ’s followers, we’ve been given clear marching orders to protest the evil so prevalent in our world. We don’t fight with rebel fists, clenched in rage. Our assignment is to do good, to combat evil with righteousness, darkness with light, lies with truth, hatred with love.\n\nThough it sounds warm and fuzzy, we cannot expect the world to respond to us with heart eyes. Jesus Himself warned us that they would instead take up arms against us.\n\n“If the world hates you, understand that it hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own. However, because you are not of the world, \n\nbut I have chosen you out of it, the world hates you” (John 15:18–19).\n\nThis battle is not new. There is no bait and switch. Jesus is clear: we will offer love and receive something else in return. Our good deeds may fall on deaf ears, or worse, turn others against us. Knowing this to be true from his own experience, Peter sought to encourage believers who faced suffering for the sake of the gospel. He told them, “It is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil” (1 Peter 3:17).\n\nBecause of Christ, we are free to face such reactions from the world without the element of surprise. As in all things, Christ goes before us. He absorbed insults for His wisdom, betrayal for His faithfulness, and lashings for His love. Because of Him, we can bless when we are cursed, do good when others seek to harm us, and love when we are hated. We stand ready with hope, in a dark world that needs hope so desperately.\n\nMay we follow the example of our humble Savior, Church. May our hope in Jesus prepare our hearts for the battles we may face because of our love for Him. Let the world hurl their worst in our direction. Because of Jesus, we stand ready, eager to see hope break through.\n\nBut in your hearts regard Christ the Lord as holy, ready at any time to give a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you. Yet do this with \n\ngentleness and respect (1 Peter 3:15–16).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nI’m a big fan of the bottom line. Get me to the point, and fast. Perhaps that’s why I love this gem, found near the middle of the book of 1 Peter: “Above all, maintain constant love for one another, since love covers a multitude of sins” (4:8).\n\nThis is the axis upon which the book of 1 Peter pivots. If we take a zoomed out approach, we see Peter tackling all manner of tough topics in this little letter. From holiness, to submission, to suffering, to leadership—Peter went for the jugular in his appeal to the Church. But all of it rises and falls and culminates with love.\n\nBecause what is “holiness,” divorced from a love for God? It’s rule-following at best, and legalism at its worst. What is submission apart from love? Manipulation? Fear? The ugly counterpart to dominance? Who wants a loveless marriage or cold-hearted shepherd? Not me. Not you, I’m sure.\n\nLove is the linchpin that holds us all together. That’s why Peter reminds us that as Christ’s followers, love is what we are to strive for “above all.” But look again. This is not just is not the run-of-the-mill love we have for our favorite brand of ice cream. It’s not even the kind of deep love we feel for the people who mean the most to us. This love, “covers a multitude of sins” and shortcomings and heartache. Peter is reminding the Church of the first century to mirror Christ’s love, demonstrated most profoundly by His sacrifice on the cross. In Christ, we are a new creation, and as such, we ought to seek to live like one—free from the bondage of sin and shame.\n\nFor we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be rendered powerless so that we may no longer be enslaved to sin, since a person who has died is freed from sin (Romans 6:6–7).\n\nThe center of Peter’s letter—of the entirety of God’s Word, really—and of our faith is this gospel truth. Christ’s abundant love, manifested in His sacrifical life, death, and resurrection, covered my sins. It covered yours. This is the gospel, in its boiled down, beautifully simple form. Love is the bottom line.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nThese days, there’s a pair of boxing gloves resting on the passenger’s seat of my car, and it makes me entirely giddy. While I’m certain I’m also improving my self defense skills and I hope to intimidate all those around me at the sight of my gloves, that’s not why I have them at all. I recently joined a boxing gym with one of my coworkers. It’s something I never thought I’d do for a million reasons, and exactly why I love it so much.\n\nYou see, the past year I’ve battled opponents like chronic pain, fatigue, and depression, which wiped me out and put me on the sidelines for weeks-turned-months on end. I am still far from winning these matches, but I’m thankful that some of the very worst parts have lifted, leaving a little space for hopeful and fun activities like exercise—things I had missed immensely. So I guess you could say my jab-jab-cross-uppercut enthusiasm is fueled by gratefulness for my newfound health and the growing distance between me and long, sleepless nights. I am doing this for my former self who couldn’t.\n\nSuffering can feel like a tough blow to the head or a punch right in the stomach, but Jesus has already fought for us and given us strength we could never muster for ourselves. And now, we suffer differently, for our former selves who couldn’t survive sin at all. Instead of backing down to pain, we rejoice when His glory is revealed, and even we “are ridiculed for the name of Christ, [we] are blessed” (1 Peter 4:13–14). We do not suffer in the same way others do because we know exactly how the battle ends.\n\nOne of the first things I learned in boxing was how to wrap my hands before putting them inside the gloves. Using a cloth bandage, I begin by wrapping my wrists, then criss-cross around my hand, covering each knuckle and protecting each finger. And because I do this, I know I’ll be safe, no matter how hard I hit the punching bag.\n\nWhen we face hard times as children of God, we are given something to wrap around our hearts for protection: the truth of who He is. We cover our minds in Scripture, trusting that no matter what we face, we do not face it without our Father, who wears a belt of righteousness and a sash of faithfulness (Isaiah 11:5).\n\nWith these words, He makes sure all our doubts are answered and all our fears are covered by His love for us. So when we step into the ring of discomfort, we already know the outcome; we are called blessed by the Lord, our God. Thanks be to Him.\n\n“Blessed are the poor in spirit,\n\nfor the kingdom of heaven is theirs.\n\nBlessed are those who mourn,\n\nfor they will be comforted.\n\nBlessed are the humble,\n\nfor they will inherit the earth.\n\nBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,\n\nfor they will be filled.”\n– Matthew 5:3–6\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nI’m a girl very much in love with creature comforts like yoga pants, guacamole, and on-demand TV. I’d rather not be uncomfortable, much less suffer. I mean, I’m not alone in this, right? While we may not suffer isolation or oppression like the readers of Peter’s letter, we all have places of hardship and difficulty.\n\nYes, despite my affection for stretchy pants and binge-worthy programming, life for me has sticky places. Places that reveal my selfish heart and prickly pride. I have relationships that are tense and less than loving. There are situations that bring me a ton of stress and, to a mild degree, “suffering.” But tucked here in 1 Peter 5 is a tiny, often overlooked admonition that might help soften the blow of those situations.\n\nPeter is encouraging church leaders, called elders, to shepherd and serve the people of God well. Why would Peter interrupt his commentary on suffering and Christian living in an ungodly culture to talk to church leadership? It seems Peter knew that their wise counsel and tender care would be critical in helping God’s people persevere.\n\nBut I wonder if Peter was also speaking to this group of men because he knew they would experience their own unique brand of suffering because of their call to shepherd God’s flock? Are we surprised? Living in relationship with Christ-followers is hard and messy because living in any relationship is hard and messy. We sometimes glamorize or expect more from our brothers and sisters in Christ, but friend, though Jesus is King of my heart, I can still be super selfish, prideful, and easily frustrated. How about you?\n\nI don’t want to cause anyone undue suffering, especially not someone who is sacrificially serving the body of Christ. Our leaders are called, and I think equipped, to demonstrate grace and humility toward the people of God. But look at what Peter says to you and me: “All of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another” (1 Peter 5:5). We can all partner together to make the work of living together as Christ-followers a bit easier by putting on humility.\n\nWhen we choose to believe the best about the girl whose short reply kind of hurt our feelings, we put on humility. When we extend grace to the friend who blew us off (again), we put on humility. When we focus on our leaders’ strengths rather than berating them for their weaknesses, we put on humility. When we gladly serve, even as others do less than their fair share, we put on humility.\n\nThis call rings loudly within the context of Christian community, but think about the places in your life where you are currently suffering. Could Peter’s charge to be clothed with humility let you stretch in grace, persevere in patience, or extend forgiveness? Perhaps none of our hard places will feel as comfortable as our yoga pants, but might humility be the thing that makes us more comfortable in those less than comfortable circumstances?\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nIn this world, we are going to suffer. It’s true. That’s what Peter is saying at the end of his letter. There are spiritual things going on in this world that he wants us to remember. First, we have an enemy, and a very real one at that. And his most successful tactical move toward defeating us is perhaps our own tendency toward distraction. We’d much rather look for ways to explain our pain and suffering, or find ways to numb or ignore it—anything but lean into it.\n\nThe world is blind to the schemes of the enemy, who has also blinded their eyes to the light of the gospel (2 Corinthians 4:4–6). This is why Peter is pleading with Christ-followers to “be sober-minded, be alert.” Because our “adversary the devil is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for anyone he can devour” (1 Peter 5:8).\n\nNow, I can assure you that when facing down a lion, real or hypothetical, my first instinct will always be to flee, not stand and fight. And this lion Peter is warning us about is very real, indeed—whether we’re aware of him or not—and he is always stalking us, circling, looking for a weakness to exploit. Therefore, we are to “resist him,” standing “firm in the faith, knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced by [our] fellow believers throughout the world” (v.9). We must be awake to his schemes.\n\nSuffering throughout a fallen world? The enemy would far rather we continue to be surprised by it, especially if, in the midst of our pain, we begin to doubt the goodness of our God. And so we must remember that our personal pain and suffering this side of heaven are not the exception (1 Peter 4:12). Nor are our struggles really with one another; they are with evil itself (Ephesians 6:12).\n\nThis enemy will use every weapon in his arsenal to abuse us and tear us away from the path God has called us to. He wants to keep us from maturing in the faith, and he most definitely does not want us to become who God created us to be: devoted lovers of God, who display His love and splendor to the world. Our enemy wants to wound us and will stop at nothing to do it.\n\nBut here’s the most important thing to remember: Jesus Christ defeated death and evil itself (John 16:33), and if we are in Him, we’ve conquered them too—the enemy cannot harm us (1 John 5:4, 18–19). We belong to a loving, all-powerful God, who does not abuse us through suffering. Instead, He draws us closer to Him, healing and transforming us through our pain—not in spite of it. Because of this, we will never be crushed under the weight of persecution or affliction. This suffering is only temporary, but our salvation is secure, our relationship with our Creator everlasting (2 Corinthians 4:7–9, 16–18). And after we have suffered a little while, God Himself will restore us and make us strong, firm and steadfast (1 Peter 5:10). Thanks be to our God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nAt first, Peter just doesn’t get it. After all, he’s the guy who cut off a guard’s ear in the garden and denied Christ three times before His crucifixion. Peter was quick to speak, but understanding took years. The mystery of the Messiah was a true mystery to him. He didn’t fully understand Christ’s purpose, or how He was truly God.\n\nBut in this letter, it’s clear Peter finally understands. Here he makes one of the clearest declarations of Christ’s divinity found in the New Testament, calling Him “our God and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 1:1). After Christ’s death and resurrection, Peter finally grasps who Christ really is.\n\nWinston Churchill once quipped, “Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing has happened.” Ah, Winston, how do you know us so well? When we see the truth of Christ as Messiah and Savior, it’s sure easier to dust ourselves off and hurry on like we never caught a glimpse of the truth. The truth was hard for Peter, and it’s still hard for us to understand today.\n\nBut truth of this saving knowledge of Jesus is central to Peter’s letter. So what does he mean by “the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord”? (v.2). This knowledge is supposed to multiply grace and peace to us. Saving knowledge of God leads us to grow in our faith. God’s grace is the source of all godly living, thus God’s grace results in godliness.\n\nPeter’s list of godly qualities does not detail the prerequisites for salvation, but the natural outpouring of a heart that seeks knowledge of God. It’s possible to be Christians and still be “ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord” if we aren’t increasing in the qualities of godliness (v.8, ESV). Even with the saving knowledge of Christ, we still need His grace. That’s why Peter prays, “May grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord” (v.2).\n\nThen Peter enjoins believers to “make every effort to confirm your calling and election, because if you do these things you will never stumble” (v.10). This is the proper activity of the Christian life. We are to know Christ, and by knowing Him, to grow in Him and abide in Him.\n\nSeek Christ. Don’t squander His grace. All who abide in Him will bear fruit. If your faith is not bearing fruit, something is wrong. Many have deceived themselves, thinking their faith was genuine. Others have stunted their own growth in the faith by negligence and sloth. The answer to either peril is the same: run to Christ, whose “divine power has given us everything required for life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness” (v.3).\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI’m so pregnant right now. I’m past taking chipper walks and decorating my nursery. I’m at the stage where I can’t sleep anymore, so I just cry while I watch reruns of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. I love being pregnant, and I was such a good soldier for so long. But there’s something about the difficulty of the last few weeks of pregnancy that primes and steels a woman for the intensity of labor and delivery. It makes us ready and willing to undergo any hardship just to be delivered from the close quarters of late pregnancy. That, and I’m tired of performing a trust fall every time I try to sit in a chair.\n\nI love having babies. But when pregnancy gets hard, I have to remember the end goal—the baby! Somehow in the muddle of pregnancy and labor I forget all about the baby and focus on my heartburn and my contractions. I literally forget about the baby. This is true for so many things; when times get dark, it can be easy to forget the one, most important thing and instead get caught up in all the peripheral ephemera. But when it’s dark, we need the lamp of truth to lead us home.\n\nGod’s Word is that lamp shining in a dark place. His Word was delivered by prophets and then confirmed in the person of Jesus Christ. He inspires and fortifies our faith by the eyewitness accounts that again and again confirm what the prophets spoke and wrote.\n\nPeter was one such eyewitness, a man who stood on the mount of transfiguration and heard the voice of God. I can’t even imagine. Somehow Peter managed to pry himself off the ground and listen to the words God spoke: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased!” (2 Peter 1:17). God is constantly bringing us the light of His Word to illuminate our confusion.\n\nDon’t allow yourself to be confused or distracted. We do not hold to a cleverly devised myth, but to Truth itself. Christ came in space and time, walked before eyewitnesses who beheld “his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). We have the witness of the Word, strongly confirmed in history, bearing witness to Christ, our Light and Life (2 Peter 1:19).\n\nWe must hold tight to the things that are true. We know that Jesus is God’s son (Matthew 17:5). We know that He came to save us (Romans 6:23). And we know that His Word is a light in the darkness (2 Peter 1:19).\n\nToday, even though I have both heartburn AND contractions, I am looking forward to holding my baby. Instead of letting ourselves get caught up in the passing peripherals, we must remember that Christ is the one important thing, and we have the truths of God’s Word to hold us steady when the rush and press of life threatens to tip us over.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nIn high school, we learned the basic structure of a great story: conflict, climax, and resolution. You start with conflict; the obstacle in the story that the main character must overcome. Then you need a climax; the dramatic turning point where the battle is faced head-on. And finally, you give the reader resolution; the conflict is defeated, and the story concludes. You’ll notice most of our beloved books and movies follow this format.\n\nI’m sure I don’t need to tell you that life doesn’t usually play out like a movie. There’s not always a simple three-part storyline. And sadly, there is sometimes no obvious resolution to our problems.\n\nOur reading from Peter’s second letter addresses the resolution coming for false teachers. Peter calls out religious teachers profiting from a blasphemous version of the gospel. Make no mistake, Peter saw this as a serious offense. Yet, while their sin was worthy of death, many of the false teachers seemed to keep prospering in their work.\n\nPeter’s letter to believers essentially says, “You may not see the resolution right now, but let me tell you how this story is going to end.” Peter declares that God is for the good of His people, and the Lord will fiercely defend His children from evil. Peter reminds us that God fights for His people. He’s not some fairy godmother who shows up to grant our wishes. Peter recalls how the Lord destroyed whole cities and even sent a flood because of His wrath and judgment against wrongdoing.\n\nSometimes we squirm a bit when we hear about God’s wrath. We might feel more comfortable with depictions of the sacrificial Lamb or the overflowing Spirit. But when we cut out the God of justice, we miss out on a vital part of the Lord’s heart. Perhaps we squirm because we know deep down we deserve wrath too. But the greatest story of all time shows we have nothing to fear.\n\nThe story of Jesus started in the garden, where the great conflict of sin entered stage left. From that time on, men and women tried to overcome their flaws and put the world back together with little success. It’s not until Jesus took center stage, bearing the weight of the world’s sin on the cross, that we reached the true climax of the story. Because the Lord knows how to rescue us (2 Peter 2:9), He knew how death needed to be defeated. Christ was raised victorious, and all who call on His name will enter the kingdom of heaven with Him. When you’re in the midst of a struggle with no resolution in sight, remember how this grand story ends.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nYou know when you make a big deal out of something pretty insignificant? Maybe your day didn’t start on the right foot, and you just hit a tipping point. Now you’ve completely lost perspective on the matter at hand and can’t seem to right your focus. Does this ever happen to you?\n\nIt’s easy to get caught up in the struggles of the daily grind. While we believe the very breath in our lungs is a gift from God, we lose our grasp on the miracle of life when the kids are fighting, a stressful project is due, or a relationship goes awry. It’s natural to focus on the things in our lives that need attention, but how can we do that without losing sight of the bigger picture?\n\nIn Peter’s second letter, he reminds believers not to lose sight of the greater story. For Peter, one of the most encouraging things to remember in times of trials was the coming Day of the Lord. So often, we focus on the death and resurrection of Christ but forget His promise to return. When we do, we lose sight of where our lives are headed.\n\nPeter even said that there will be false teachers who question God’s timing and try to convince believers that Christ isn’t coming back. But our hope rests in the trustworthy promises of the Lord. And because Christ said He’ll return like “a thief in the night,” we need to be prepared for His arrival at any moment (1 Thessalonians 5:2).\n\nWhat does it look like to be prepared? It’s not about storing up good deeds, because nothing we ever do will be perfect enough to deserve heaven. All we need to do is place our trust in Jesus, our Savior. He stands in the gap and covers all our sin. “Based on his promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness dwells” (2 Peter 3:13). These promises rest not on our merit, but on His.\n\nIn knowing that Christ will come back at any moment, the stressors of our lives seem less significant. In the new heavens and new earth, a bad grade on a test or an embarrassing moment won’t mean a thing. In fact, “Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away” (Revelation 21:4). We will be with the one who created us, the one who fulfills our every need. In the midst of the messy and mundane, let’s refocus our eyes upward as we wait expectantly for the coming of the Lord.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nCan’t we all just agree that cookie dough is best when consumed raw? (Yes, I am aware of those four little words—“do not consume raw”—on the package that would say otherwise.) I don’t know if it’s the taste of sheer rebellion or the perfectly gooey texture, but regardless, I am never totally convinced that sacrificing the delicious and immediate taste of cookie dough is worth the patience and distress of waiting for the dough to actually become warm cookies.\n\nPerhaps the English proverb “Have your cake and eat it too” should apply to any type of baked good. We want to experience the good thing that’s available now and still have the good thing to come later. Thankfully, Peter’s letters don’t ask us to make that choice. Unlike the cookie dough warnings, Peter encourages us to savor our relationship with God both now and forever, because that’s how much time we’ve been given to enjoy our Savior.\n\nGod’s economy is different from anything we’ve ever experienced here on earth. His understanding of time and other resources is complete, whereas ours is limited. But being His children, we don’t need to worry about saving or storing up His goodness in order to make sure they will last another day. Nor do we need to feel ashamed for fully enjoying God and His blessings too much; His glory is consistently and eternally abundant.\n\nNow, we await the day when all His promises will come to fruition (Romans 15:4). Throughout eternity, we will have the privilege of learning more about the One who made those promises to us.\n\nNow, as an act of submission to a loving God, we attempt to live up to our calling as people who are already spotless in His sight, fully loved and wholly accepted (2 Peter 3:16). Throughout eternity, we will enjoy the righteousness Christ has won for us. Sin will be a thing of the past.\n\nNow, God’s ways appear to be hidden from us, but we can trust that they are always better than our understanding (Isaiah 55:8–9). And throughout eternity, we will see Him face to face and know Him as He truly is (1 Corinthians 13:12).\n\nNow, we are called to be on guard, to be sober-minded, so we will not be led astray. Peter instructs us to do this as we “grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 3:17–18). Throughout eternity, we will reign with Him.\n\nEven as we prepare for God’s coming kingdom, He has given us “everything required for life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness” (1 Peter 1:3). As he concludes his second letter, Peter reminds us of this truth that is everlasting: God’s own glory and goodness are ours to receive, enjoy, and share, from now until eternity. To Him be the glory, always. Amen.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nWhat do you do when God’s plans for your life unfold differently than you expected? \n\nThis question arises again and again throughout the Bible. Abraham is promised descendants, but then his wife is barren. Joseph is promised leadership, but then he is thrown into a pit. The disciples are promised a Messiah, but then He is arrested and killed.\n\nOver and over throughout the Bible, God’s people live in a tension between the promises of God and the reality of their present circumstances, and this tension is the context of Revelation.\n\nPrior to the writing of this book, the world had experienced an unprecedented outpouring of the Spirit of God. People saw miraculous signs and wonders. The gospel spread like wildfire. Thousands came to Christ. Lives were changed. It all must have felt fast and furious and wonderful.\n\nAnd then, as if someone had slowly turned off the faucet of God’s power, the revolution seemed to stall. In its place, persecution. Roman authorities increasingly pressured Christians to worship Caesar or face severe punishment. The hostility toward Christians intensified, and this left them wondering: \n\nWhere was God?  What happened to His promises? Is Jesus still coming back?  What do we do now?\n\nSooner or later, we all find ourselves in this place of uncertainty. We wonder if we misheard God or if we did something wrong to provoke Him—or if He is even there at all. And in this place of tension, it’s tempting for doubt to become our compass, instead of faith.\n\nThis is where the book of Revelation begins. The people of God are struggling, and the mission feels unclear. As a result, some Christians are compromising the truth of God’s Word and caving into the culture. Some are disobedient, while others are simply lukewarm. So God reiterates His promises with a “revelation” to John that is glorious and startling and surreal.\n\nIt’s easy to get lost in the imagery of this book, but the first chapter of Revelation holds the key. All we really need to know of “the First and the Last” (v.17) is that Jesus Himself is the definitive “revelation” for the world. Everything we need to know about God, we know through Christ. Everything we need to know about our past, we know through Christ. Everything we need to know about our future, we know through Christ. \n\nNot an inch of God’s Word or God’s plan is out of character with the Son of God, and this is the lens through which we should read everything contained in Revelation. It is tempting to be dogmatic about the meaning of these abstract images, but the point of this book is simple: to direct our trust toward the “Living One” who was dead and is now “alive forever and ever” (v.18).\n\nThis truth about Jesus—about His life, His death, and His resurrection—does not change with our circumstances or with our doubts. It holds. Whatever may come, Jesus is our unstoppable hope, from first to last. That is the message of Revelation, and the message for our lives.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\n“Things are getting worse and worse.”\n\nWhen we look at the news, the culture, the entertainment, and even the Church today, it’s easy to feel as if everything is slowly getting worse. It’s tempting to believe that the world is gradually unraveling, and that we are moving further away from truth, instead of toward it.\n\nWhenever we feel this cynicism begin to creep in, the temptation is to idealize the generations that have gone before us. We think, Our parents’ generation, our grandparents’ generation, the earliest Christians—they had it all together. Things weren’t as bad back then!\n\nI struggle with this mentality often. There are days when I feel jaded about Christians and about the Church. I log onto social media and see division and in-fighting, or I read about a pastor failing his congregation and his family. I see name-calling and judgment and the drawing of big, deep lines, and my heart wants to harden toward it all.\n\nOn those days when we are tempted to dismiss the world with a flick of the wrist, when we find ourselves looking down on other Christians who “aren’t doing it right,” and when we despair that the Church’s reputation is hopelessly smeared, Revelation 2–3 has a word for us.\n\nIn these chapters, written just a generation after Jesus’s resurrection, many churches are distracted and lost. Although they are working hard and striving to be faithful, God also levels the following charges against them: \n\nThey had forsaken their first love (2:4).\n\nThey participated in pagan rituals (2:14).\n\nThey were sexually immoral (2:14).\n\nThey embraced false teaching (2:15, 20).\n\nThey had a reputation of being alive, but they were dead (3:1).\n\nThey were lukewarm, neither hot nor cold (3:16).\n\nAll this, only sixty years after Jesus walked the earth.\n\nWhat this tells us is that the world is not simply getting worse, and neither is the Church. Following Jesus has always been hard. Faithfulness to God has always come unnaturally. Ever since sin entered the world, human nature has found it difficult to obey. \n\nAnd that is exactly why we need a Savior. \n\nThe good news of Jesus Christ begins with the bad news that we are broken. We have always been distracted. We have always resisted the truth. It was true two thousand years ago, and it is just as true today. Therefore, these letters to the seven churches in Asia minor are important for us as well. “Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches” (Revelation 2:29).\n\nBut our brokenness has never stopped God. Our division, our fighting, our apathy, our immorality, even our bad theology—none of it has ever stopped God. So when we read Revelation 2–3, we can do three things. First, we can remember that humanity is not getting worse, and neither is the Church—the temptation to turn away from God and His ways has always been there. Second, we can welcome this list of rebukes as an opportunity to identify our own areas of need. \n\nAnd finally, we can hope. In Revelation 3:19, God says, “Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline” (NIV). When we see darkness in the world—no matter how great—we don’t have to despair, and our hearts don’t have to grow hard. Instead, we can consider the possibility that God is allowing us to see these things, so that He can redeem them. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nOne of my sons’ favorite bedtime stories is The Sword in the Stone. As a child, I grew up watching the animated version of this tale, in which a lanky, awkward boy named Arthur unwittingly prepares to become king. Set in twelfth century England, the legend describes a country in turmoil, where the king has died without an heir to take his place. In order to resolve this dilemma, a wizard named Merlin places a sword in an anvil with the following words inscribed upon it: “Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise King born of all England.”\n\nAs the story goes, plenty of strong men and mighty warriors attempt to remove the sword, but every one of them fails. That is, until Arthur. This young, scrawny, misfit approaches the sword and is able to pull it from the anvil, finally restoring order to the kingdom.\n\nThe legend of Arthur is only a myth, but it echoes a story that is not. In chapters 4 and 5 of Revelation, we encounter a similar scene, but in place of a sword we have a scroll (5:1). We don’t know what exactly is inside the scroll, but New Testament scholar N.T. Wright speculates: “We rightly guess… that it contains God’s secret plan to undo and overthrow the world-destroying projects that have already gained so much ground, and to plant and nurture instead the world-rescuing project which will get creation itself back on track in the right direction.”\n\nMuch like the sword in the stone, what is significant about the scroll is not simply what is inside of it, but Who is able to unseal it. Like the sword, there is only one who is worthy to unleash its power. That chosen one, we soon discover, is Jesus—the “Lamb,” the “Root of David,” the “Lion from the tribe of Judah” (5:6,5). Christ alone can initiate God’s plan to rescue and redeem the world. \n\nThat is how the two stories are similar. This is how they differ:\n\nIn The Sword and the Stone, Arthur does nothing to earn the title of king. Although legend holds that he was secretly a royal heir, Arthur’s worthiness (much like Abraham, Moses, and David) comes solely from the fact that he is chosen for the task. He does not earn it, and he does not deserve it.\n\nChrist, on the other hand, is a different kind of hero. He is not simply plucked from thin air. Instead, the Lamb is worthy for two important reasons. First, He is worthy to redeem the brokenness of the world because He is the only one who did not contribute to it. And second, He is worthy to rescue humanity because He purchased us by His blood (5:9). \n\nUnlike most of our favorite heroes, Jesus was not chosen in spite of Himself. Even our greatest heroes, our noblest heroes, our most perfect heroes are still only a shadow of the Hero we have in Christ. By virtue of His identity and by the power of His blood, He alone is able to open the scroll and initiate God’s plan to redeem the world.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nEvery year, wildfires break out on America’s west coast, decimating forests and grasslands, threatening homes, and turning the sunset skies into a haze of pink. The power of fire is terrifying and awesome, and we’ve all seen the danger it poses to homes and lives in its path. While fire holds a mighty power for destruction, the land on the west coast actually needs a certain amount of these fires; they clean forest floors, pare down the plants that consume the water, kill plant diseases, and release seeds from trees that require fire to start the next generation. Don’t let the power and terror of fire mask the severe good that it serves.\n\nThe coming of God’s judgment is a terror to the wicked, but it is a comfort to His children. God’s judgment is not blind punishment. It is the setting right of all things. God comes to judge sin and avenge injustice. And in Scripture we see that He holds back judgment for a time so that many more might come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). To those who trust in Him, His judgment is a refining fire that strips away sin and removes the sting of death. God’s judgment sets the world right again.\n\nHe comes to undo the curse and make all things new. God’s judgment carries this beautiful promise: “They will no longer hunger; they will no longer thirst; the sun will no longer strike them, nor will any scorching heat” (Revelation 7:16). What a joyful declaration! Our king will take away the curse of sin and death and bring us to a place of satiety and comfort. I love that the God of the universe cares whether or not I’m hungry or too hot. Our personal comfort seems so small on the universal scale of things. God’s concern for even our thirst is an indication of His tender, personal love.\n\nGod’s final judgment comes to reveal His reign. For all things are His. The whole book of Revelation (indeed the whole canon of Scripture) is about Christ, and this is what it says about Him: He’s seated on a throne (v.17); He is wise and powerful, never caught off guard (v.12 ); He shelters us, and we are safe in Him (v.15); and His gospel is true (v.10).\n\nThe burning fire of God’s judgment is unquestionably a terror to those who do not know Him. But to those who are called by His name—to His own children—the coming of His judgment heralds the setting right of all things. He comes to rescue His children and bring them home.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThe language in today’s passage is full of rich imagery: a flaming mountain is thrown into the sea, a third of the stars are blackened, and crowned locusts ride horses with scorpion tails into battle. It’s both chillingly specific and massively cryptic—and why are there seven seals, anyway? Before we get carried away, we have to remember that Scripture must first be interpreted through the lens of Scripture. So where else in Scripture do we see the number seven? It’s a parallel to the seven days of creation, the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, Jacob’s seven years of service to Laban, the seven trumpets of Jericho, etc. In God’s Word, seven is a number of completion.\n\nIn all the swirling imagery, the central purpose of all Scripture is to teach the good news of the gospel: Christ has come to save. And the whole book of Revelation is just the same. These judgments show us the completion of God’s good work. And the end purpose of God’s work of salvation is that He should abide with us, and we with Him. He is our God, and we are His people.\n\nBecause we are His, we can rejoice at His coming, and at the restoration of righteousness. Judgment must come. Justice is necessary because He is justice. He will make all things right. He will not allow wickedness to go on forever. \n\nGod’s judgment is total, and our only escape is Jesus. For those of us in Christ, our judgment was paid by Christ at the cross. The weight of our judgment has already fallen on Him. Therefore, we should rejoice at God’s coming judgment, because it will restore righteousness.\n\nWe are His, and so we need not fear any present tribulation. The consequences of evil in this world are scary, and the threat to believers is real. But the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous (1 Peter 3:12). He is always with us, and He cares for us. His ears are open to our prayers, and He is not indifferent to our cries. Even in judgment, God is merciful to those who love Him. \n\nWe need not fear, because we are His. Instead, we can be people of hope, joy, and peace. This is cause for great rejoicing. His justice is ongoing, and this passage is not the final judgment but a picture of God’s ongoing work in the world. He is constantly doling out mercy to us, deferring judgment, calling us back to Him. His work is not done in our families or in our communities. Therefore, have hope for your children, for your parents, and for your neighbors who are not yet believers. God is constantly at work.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThe Arctic Tern gets more sunlight than any other animal on earth. These birds migrate from pole to pole every year, covering about 25,000 miles. Summering at the north pole, they enjoy weeks of 24-hour sunlight, and at the other end of their migration, they bask in the same full-sun days at the south pole. They literally chase summer all over the globe. If it weren’t so hard, we might all be tempted to do it—imagine a beautiful summer that never ends.\n\nThe point of the whole book of Revelation is the glory of Christ. His glory is so big and so wonderful that I have to imagine endless, gorgeous, sunshine-filled days to get in the right frame of mind. We can’t even grasp what it would be like to live in the glow of His glory, but I know that it will be good. So good.\n\nWe get a glimpse of His glory in the mighty angel standing astride sea and land in today’s reading (Revelation 10:5). Based on the being’s majestic description, many commentators believe this “angel” to be Christ Himself. Regardless of one’s interpretation of this particular passage, however, the whole of Scripture points to this beautiful truth: Christ is worthy. The end result of the judgment and war brings us back to where we began: the Word made flesh mercifully for us.\n\nBecause Christ is worthy, we know that the nations and kingdoms of this world are only temporary. God’s kingdom is the only one that will last. The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever (Revelation 11:15). Christ receives all the kingdoms as His inheritance, which He delivers to the Father (1 Corinthians 15:24–28). And for those who love and trust in Him, the eternal kingdom becomes our inheritance in Christ (1 Peter 1:3–5).\n\nFinally, God finishes His work. “Then he said to me, ‘It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end’” (Revelation 21:6). There is no stopping or undoing what God has done. Our redemption is sure and complete in Christ. And He will bring to completion the work of sanctification and glorification when He comes again. And so we pray: “Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10).\n\nIn Revelation we see Christ, fully worthy and glorified. He is the beginning and the end of all our stories. And we will bask in the warmth and light of His glory for all eternity. It is more than I can imagine. Come quickly, Lord Jesus!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nOne of my favorite hymns is “For All the Saints.” I was reminded of it when reflecting on today’s reading. Every verse of the song compels us to cling to “our Rock, our Fortress,” and “our Captain” in the battle, as we keep our eyes trained toward a more glorious day yet to come. It echoes this truth from Revelation: God is and forever will be seated on His throne, and all the heavenly hosts give glory, honor, and thanks to Him. The hymn continues:\n\nAnd when the strife is fierce, the warfare long; Steals on the ear the distant triumph song.  And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.  Alleluia! Alleluia!\n\nThe strife really is fierce, and it has been since the serpent sowed deceit and destruction in the garden of Eden. Our fear of God, alienation from Him and one another, deceit and pride and endless greed—these things tore the fabric of our human existence before the curse was pronounced upon the serpent. \n\nAnd yet in the midst of Genesis 3, God declared a message of hope that has echoed throughout human history: the offspring of the woman would one day “crush” the serpent’s head (v.15). True, the serpent would “crush” (yes, it’s the same word in Hebrew) the heel of Eve’s offspring—a lethal blow, but one that would end in the greatest, most victorious event in human history: the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. \n\nThat malevolent serpent has since donned many hideous characteristics, and Revelation 12 does not mince words when describing the evil one. We read that the “great fiery red dragon” has been intent on devouring the woman (representing Israel, God’s people) and her Son, Jesus the Messiah. There is an appallingly fierce war in the heavenly realms, one we can hardly imagine. The grim powers of evil and the mighty forces of good tangle with each other. The dragon is identified as the ancient serpent, the devil, who leads the whole world astray. This is serious in the extreme, not to be dismissed with a wave of our enlightened hand. (We often do that.)\n\nIn other words, our battle here on earth is not done. We face the rage of the devil who knows his time is short and his end sure (v.12). But we also know the perspective from God’s throne:\n\nThen I heard a loud voice in heaven say, “The salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have now come, because the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night,  has been thrown down” (v.10).\n\nAs painful as our suffering here on earth is, victory is ours by the blood of the Lamb (v.11). We are empowered by and rest in the assurance that God has made us alive in Christ, that Lamb sitting on the throne. His shed blood has cancelled out the debt we owe, and the enemy has been disarmed completely. The serpent’s head has been crushed at the cross (Colossians 2:13–15). \n\nAlleluia indeed. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nThere is just no way around it. The apocalyptic scene described in Revelation 13 is horrifying. It appears that every possible embodiment of sheer evil will be turned loose on the world—particularly against those who “hold firmly” to the testimony of Jesus (12:17). Add to that, supernatural deception and oppressive brutality will be the all-encompassing order of the day (13:13–17). Everything is utter calamity. How can we possibly face the prospect of such disasters? I don’t know about you, but I’d prefer to simply disappear before the catastrophe begins.\n\nBut what about today, here and now? As we consider our own times, what can we say to encourage God’s people who are currently facing such ferocious animosity? How do we pray for believers whose lives are threatened day in and day out by vicious, nearly unimaginable manifestations of hatred? While Revelation 13 may be part of a much more comprehensive and sober glimpse into the future, there are also crucial lessons for us today.\n\nBottom line for now: there are no easy answers when God’s people are faced with cruel injustices. There are no detours around the painful suffering brought about by those who practice evil. Instead, “this calls for endurance and faithfulness from the saints” (13:10). We are called to stand with those who are subjected to persecution, insults, and unjust treatment (Hebrews 10:33–34). \n\nAnd how can we best do that? With fervent intercessory prayer. Scripture tells us that God is always with us, but with fervent intercessory prayer, we can pray for His presence to be known and felt by those who suffer. We can cry out on their behalf, asking God to grant them peace. \n\nIn talking with friends and acquaintances whose suffering makes my own experiences pale in comparison, I have been both humbled and amazed by what their words have in common. As a result of their truly grim circumstances, they have come to know a deeper intimacy with God. May such be true for all of us!\n\nIt’s difficult to pray well, but it’s important to proclaim God’s “great and precious promises” (2 Peter 1:4) on behalf of those who need endurance for each coming hour. May they (and we) be assured that the One who is coming will not delay (Hebrews 10:37) and that there awaits us “a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 1:11, NIV). We cling to these truths even when everything else seems to give way at the very foundations (Psalm 46). \n\nThat “rich welcome” that awaits God’s faithful and enduring people has stayed generations of believers. The book of Hebrews assures us that we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses as we run the race set before us. I like to think of them cheering on God’s faithful people as we feebly struggle, yet keeping our eyes on “the source and perfecter of our faith” (Hebrews 12:1–2). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nThe thundering voice from heaven.The new song before God’s throne.The proclamation of the eternal gospel across the globe.\n\nIn reading Revelation 14, we begin to hear the echoes of hope, when each mighty angel from the heavenly realms announces that the final hour of judgment has come. We’re told there will be harvests—first the reaping of ripe grain and then the gathering of clusters of grapes for the winepress, God’s wrath. And while the image of God’s wrath and judgment seems unimaginable and terrifying, it’s actually good news: Those who’ve worshiped the beast, the embodiment of evil, and carried out his vicious schemes will one day drink the wine of God’s wrath (14:9–11).\n\nWine is an image reverberating out from Old Testament prophets (Isaiah 51:17–23; Jeremiah 25:15–31; Habakkuk 2:16), through Psalm 75:7–8, and into the garden of Gethsemane (Matthew 26). It’s there that Jesus, knowing full well what was coming, prayed that the “cup” might be taken from Him. Then in utter and complete submission to the perfect will of His Father, He said, “Yet not as I will, but as you will,” and took in the full cup of God’s righteous wrath (v.39).\n\nBut as the redeemed, we have hope, and this is where our hope lies: with the victorious Lamb who takes away the sin of the world and rescues us from God’s coming wrath (John 1:29; 1 Thessalonians 1:10). Until that day, we are called to remain faithful and endure (Revelation 14:12). Death has not yet been dealt its final lethal blow, but in the meantime, we trust in the promise that those saints “who die in the Lord” will one day find “rest from their labors” (v.13). \n\nLooking forward, the author of Hebrews assures us that we are headed for the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the living God. We are headed to the welcome of thousands upon thousands of the angelic host, as well as other believers, whose names are written in heaven. It’s there that Jesus, our perfect Mediator, faithfully intercedes for us, even today (Hebrews 12:22–24).\n\nSo let those who have been redeemed from the hand of the enemy—those gathered from all the lands, east, west, north, and south—give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! (Psalm 107:1–3). Let those from every nation, tribe, language, and people join in a mighty chorus of praise for the Lamb who has overcome. And let us join as a mighty chorus, praising and worshiping “the one who made the heaven and earth” and then redeemed them for eternity (Revelation 14:7).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nWhen it comes to how to respond to the righteous judgment of God, we only have two options. We can worship in wonder or we can wave a rebel fist. There is no middle ground, no gray area, no third option. Just worship or rebellion, reverence or revolt. \n\nHere, in Revelation 15–16 we see a picture of the wrath of God poured out. It’s a terrifying image, bowls filled to the brim with the righteous judgment of God. As squeamish as God’s wrath may make us, deep down, we know He is justified. We look around at mankind and inwardly at our own wicked hearts and must repeat the cry of heaven: \n\n“They deserve it!”…  “Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, True and just are your judgments” (Revelation 16:6–7).\n\nNotice that in these passages, no one is arguing with God’s justice. No scales are needed to weigh and consider the justice of God. Over and over we read that these grisly judgments are in line with a fair and true God. This is justice in its purest form. And yet it’s possible, even when His justice is deserved and devastating, to choose insurrection over His goodness and mercy. Though the judgments certainly take center stage here, there is still an undercurrent of the people’s rebellion within these passages:\n\nThey “blasphemed the name of God… and they did not repent and give him glory” (v.9). They “blasphemed the God of heaven… they did not repent of their works” (v.11).They “blasphemed God” (v.21).\n\nConsider those pummeled by the final bowl of wrath. Though buried under hailstones weighing a hundred pounds, they still shook rebel fists at God. If we are honest with our own hearts, we see that our own rebellious streak runs just as deep. Our own eye for justice is just as distorted. \n\nBut God, in His infinite mercy has unclenched our rebel fists. We are shielded from God’s ultimate judgment and are now “hidden with Christ in God” (Colossians 3:3). Instead of continuing in rebellion, God’s grace has taught us to respond like Israel when the nation witnessed God’s wrath on Pharaoh and His men. \n\n“Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord. They said:\n\n ‘I will sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted; he has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea… \n\nLORD, who is like you among the gods?\n\nWho is like you, glorious in holiness,\n\nrevered with praises, performing wonders?’” (Exodus 15:1,11). \n\nGod’s righteous wrath isn’t all penned up for the Day of Judgment. Even now He judges the wicked. Even now He has the right to rule our hearts and lives. When face to face with His judgment we only have two options. Because He is so worthy, may we choose to worship the God who is just. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nJohn’s prophecy recorded in the book of Revelation is timeless. I am confident he wasn’t zeroed in on our current political climate when he described worldly leaders who were morally bankrupt and drunk on power. And yet, the shoe fits, doesn’t it? Sadly, since the fall of humanity in the garden of Eden, this shoe always seems to fit. \n\nHere in Revelation 17, we see humankind’s perversion of power personified in the prostitute. She is dressed to impress and mired in scandal. She is greedy, flashy, and horrid. I find it hard to look away. This passage has plenty of mysteries, and I won’t claim to understand them all. But life on planet earth has trained me to recognize the distorting effects of power. She is every ruler who has ever reigned and every heart twisted and broken by sin. \n\nShe is presidents and prime ministers, congressmen and counselors. She embodies parents and principals, laws and limitations. But one thing she is not—she is not the Lamb of God. Neither is the beast who is with her. Their rule and reign is fleeting. With that in mind, look closely at how the beast is described: \n\n“The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up from the abyss and go to destruction. Those who live on the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast that was, and is not, and is to come” (Revelation 8, emphasis mine).\n\nStack those words up against these descriptions of Jesus (again, emphasis mine): \n\n“Grace and peace to you from the one who is, who was, and who is to come” (Revelation 1:4).\n\n“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “the one who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty” (Revelation 1:8). \n\n“Each of the four living creatures had six wings; they were covered with eyes around and inside. Day and night they never stop, saying,\n\nHoly, holy, holy,Lord God, the Almighty,who was, who is, and who is to come” (Revelation 4:8). \n\nThe beast will reign until he doesn’t. The prostitute may have a moment in the limelight, but she cannot diminish the Light of the World by a single lumen. Every leader who has ever ruled, every king who has ever been crowned, every circumstance that has ever terrorized you—all will come to an end. But Christ will remain. Only His throne is established forever. \n\nPolitical leaders aren’t the only ones with power over me. If I keep looking inward, at my own power-hungry heart, I see some of me in the prostitute as well. I keep clawing my way back onto the throne that sits in my heart. I keep trying to take control away from the only One who is worthy to rule. Yet, the reign of sin will not last forever inside of me because brokenness won’t always be king of this world. \n\nBecause of Jesus, sin’s power is not ultimate. Sin was, but will be no more. Only the spotless Lamb and His Bride will remain. Long live the King of kings! \n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Fall of Babylon",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nTheologians with far more degrees on their walls and books on their shelves than I have can continue to debate who Babylon represents in Revelation 18. I simply don’t have the brain cells to compete. But because of the wisdom granted by the Holy Spirit, I do have what it takes to read this passage and consider this question: Where is the redemptive hand of God in these verses?\n\nThe fall of Babylon, like so much of John’s revelation, is mysterious, but when we take a closer look, we see that the gospel thread is clearly present. God’s redemptive work, which stitches all of His Word together, is beautifully and unmistakably revealed throughout this book. \n\nConsider the angel’s loud declaration, “It has fallen, Babylon the Great has fallen!” (Revelation 18:2). And then compare that declaration to Christ’s quiet resolve at the crucifixion: “When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, ‘It is finished.’ Then bowing his head, he gave up his spirit” (John 19:30). \n\nBecause of what He accomplished on the cross, all evil will crumble, every Babylon will fall, all “injustice [will shut] its mouth” (Psalm 107:42). Anything that opposes God will fall. Babylon’s sins were piled up to heaven—so were mine, so were yours—“and God remembered her crimes” (Revelation 18:5). As well He should have. But our transgressions? Our sins? He has forgotten them. \n\n“For I will forgive their wrongdoing, and I will never again remember their sins” (Hebrews 8:12).\n\nI have to remind myself often that God won’t dredge my sin back up. Not now. Not ever. Babylon’s ending is not my own. My sins have been thrown into the depths of the sea. I will receive undeserved grace, but Babylon will receive deserved destruction, paid according to her works of evil, and therefore, earning a double portion of wrath. \n\nBut “He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began” (2 Timothy 1:9). We are spared because of Christ’s work—not punished according to our own. \n\nGod certainly could have wiped me out forever. Instead, He has rebuilt my life on the precious cornerstone of His grace. And so as Christ-followers, we are to “rejoice… because God has pronounced on [Babylon] the judgment she passed” on us (Revelation 18:20).\n\nWicked Babylon is a picture of the enemy’s schemes. Seemingly secure in his triumph, fortified by the forces of darkness, for a fleeting moment he, too, appeared untouchable. And yet, our enemy has fallen. Call it out in a mighty voice! In a single hour he became a defeated foe (v.17). In a moment, with the flash of an angel, the stone rolled away, and evil crumbled. God’s plans for our redemption could not be stopped. Not then. Not now. Not ever.\n\nThe world may weep and mourn when evil crumbles, but heaven will always rejoice. Ours is a God who triumphs over evil. He redeems us for His glory. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nAs most brides do, I had high hopes (and perhaps delusions) that my wedding day would be perfect. For me, it almost was. Almost. \n\nOn a steamy Saturday in May 2001, Chad and I were preparing for our big day. My bridesmaids and I drove to the church and went to the make-shift bridal suite to start getting ready. I don’t remember how long we there before one of my bridesmaids came in and said, “Whit, you need to get upstairs because there’s a massive storm headed our way. If we don’t get you into the sanctuary now, you may have to walk in the rain.”\n\nThe church where we were getting married had two separate buildings. And there wasn’t a way for me to get from where I was to the vestibule, where I would walk down the aisle, unless I went outside. This was our window to avoid the storm, and we needed to go now. \n\nWe gathered up all our stuff and made the trek up to the sanctuary. The gorgeous blue sky that had welcomed us earlier when we first arrived was now hidden by ominous, dark clouds. Yes, a storm was imminent. Happy wedding day to us.\n\nWe piled into the foyer, but quickly realized that it wouldn’t do for the bride to be standing there greeting all the guests when they arrived. The only option we had was to file into the ladies’ restroom. It was like a bad joke: “How do you fit a bride and ten bridesmaids into a bathroom the size of a mid-size sedan?” As it turns out, not easily. \n\nI spent my last hour of single life stuffed into a church bathroom. But through it all though, my bridesmaids— my best friends dressed in sea-foam green (bless them!)—were so kind, faithful, funny, and selfless. Missi, my college roommate, had me laughing. Meredith, my soon- to-be sister-in-law, kept refilling my water. Lori and Ashley were loyal lookouts, reporting back to me who had just arrived. It’s now one of the sweetest memories of my wedding day, each of my friends making sure in her own way that I was wedding-day ready—the most beautiful, confident version of myself I could be. \n\nThe Church, the global and eternal collection of God’s people, is Christ’s Bride, and her wedding day is fast approaching. Despite the gathering clouds of external opposition and internal grumbling, all who are made alive in Christ—single, married, divorced, or widowed—need to be doing our part to make Her wedding-day ready. \n\nIt is theologically true that we, the Church, are the Bride of Christ, beautiful and beloved by Jesus Christ, our Bridegroom (Revelation 21:2). And one day, our wedding and reception, called the marriage supper of the Lamb, will be the most perfect, extravagant party you can imagine (19:6–10). \n\nHowever, I think in some ways we serve another wedding day role: that of bridesmaids. Part of our job is to make sure that the Bride is as lovely and wedding-day ready as she can be. Our goal is for the Bride to look radiant. We are partly responsible for what those outside the Christian faith think of the Bride. \n\nThat might sound good, but maybe you haven’t seen much of the resplendent Bride. Perhaps you’ve been bulldozed by a bit of a Bridezilla instead. And to that, I can relate all too well; I know the pain the Church can inflict. I truly, truly do. But while she may be messy, she is also redeemed. \n\nEven when our hurts are legitimately and deeply wounded, our challenge is to remember that Jesus loves His Bride. He doesn’t ignore her flaws or shortcomings, and He never, ever condones abuse of any kind—but make no mistake, Christ loves the Church He died to save.\n\nToday, we are standing in the vestibule of human history. We can’t know for sure when the doors will swing open and we’ll see Jesus coming for us. Between now and then, let’s do all we can to be ready for our Bridegroom.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nAs the consummation of redemptive history unfolds, God’s plan is nearly complete, and Revelation 21 and 22 tell us what will be regained and restored. But at this point in the narrative, it’s helpful to remind ourselves not just what we will gain, but what will be lost. \n\nIn the first garden, when sin entered the world, perfection was broken, marred and spoiled. A seemingly unbridgeable chasm was created between what God had intended and what humanity would now experience. Perfection was made imperfect. The devastating effect of our rebellion was all-encompassing, wrecking ourselves, our relationships, and creation. Nothing was left untouched. \n\nSin is the most aggressive of cancers. Let’s look at a few of its fatal symptoms.\n\nSin separates. The first and most catastrophic effect of the fall was how sin destroyed our intimacy with our Creator. Once His friends, we became His enemies. No longer able to enjoy intimate, unbroken fellowship with God, we hid. And as a result of our sin, we were ejected from the garden. In His mercy, God spared Adam and Eve from staying in Eden and eating from the tree of life, which would have left us forever broken (Genesis 3:22–24).\n\nSin sentences us to death. Expelled from Eden, humanity was lost, but not beyond restoration. There is hope for the fallen, but we are not spared death, which is the second consequence of sin. Every person will succumb. No one can escape it. Our bodies are breaking down. Death looms for us and our loved ones. Though we will be raised to life in Christ, most of us will mourn many times over before we see our Maker. Death, mourning, crying, and pain are the result of the fall, full of emotions we were never meant to experience. \n\nSin spoils everything. Not only does sin separate and sentence us to death, it spoils and ruins. Eden was pristine, peace-filled, and perfect. After the fall, what would have been eternally new was now destined for decay. Creation was fractured, and humanity was plunged into conflict with the rest of God’s creatures. Now creation groans and travails awaiting the restoration of what was lost. \n\nThis is the backdrop of Revelation 21. Separation. Ruin. Decay. Death. God isn’t just creating a new heaven and a new earth, glorious as that is. No, He is restoring perfection, ridding us of all the residue and side-effects of sin. Look at what He promises.\n\nWhat sin had separated, God rejoins. For the ancient Near East, water, particularly the sea, represented chaos and danger. Our new heaven and earth won’t have a sea. More profoundly, the chasm between Creator and creation has been closed. God now dwells with His people in a world where sin, decay, and death are no more. Where we once were destined for cyclical mourning, pain, and grief, we are now promised the joy and comfort of dwelling with God forever.\n\nWe were Adam and Eve’s co-conspirators, and we have lived with a death sentence ever since. But our God is now making all things new, putting an end to all that was broken. What we had forfeited, He has restored. \n\nHe was there at the beginning, our Alpha. And He is now standing at the End, our Omega. What He started, He is gloriously finishing.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nRevelation 21 and 22 paint a lovely picture of the promised end of our story, but we are not home yet. Our destination is certain and secure, but friend, we have not arrived. There is still work to be done.\n\nBelievers living on this side of the cross live in a tenuous “now” and “not yet.” Because of the resurrection of Jesus and the indwelling of His Holy Spirit, we can experience some of the kingdom now. The fruit of the Spirit is a present promise for those of us who surrender to His Lordship. We can enjoy and display love, joy, peace, patience, and kindness today.\n\nWe can grieve in a unique and gospel-centered way. We do not grieve as those who have no hope (1 Thessalonians 4:13). We mourn, but we are comforted by the hope of heaven. We can live in a fallen and fractured world without succumbing to fear or a fatalistic perspective that nothing can redeem the brokenness around us. \n\nThe call to persevere is the command for us to live as sojourners who are passing through to our eternal Promised Land. But we don’t fix our eyes on Jesus, the author, source, and perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:2), to the exclusion of others. We cannot ignore those around us. Not at all. I believe this is why Christ commanded John to write instructions for God’s people before He unfolded what was coming. Revelation opens with a clarion call to the Church, and the letters to the seven churches (Revelation 2–3) should still be the filter through which we view this “end.” We have a job to do, and Jesus expects us to do it well. \n\nWe must persevere in the face of crushing secularism and punishing persecution, passionately clinging to the gospel. When we persevere, we live with the same kind of urgency that moved Jesus to say, “I am coming soon!” (Revelation 22:7). We stay mindful that none of us—not our lost neighbor, sinful co-worker, or rebellious family member—is promised tomorrow. We and the strangers all around us are walking toward a sure judgment. One day grief will be no more, but that day is not today. However, grief does serve a purpose. It arrests our hearts with compassion and compels us to action. We ought to grieve what is coming and then live a life that proclaims the hope that Jesus’s death and resurrection secured. \n\nYes, the kingdom is both now and not yet for you and me. We can experience it now, and we must proclaim it to those who have not yet received it. And whether they persist in doing evil, as Jesus says in Revelation 22, we stay the course in faithfully preaching of the gospel in word and deed. We preach it now because His return is not yet. There is still time, and we must steward it well.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nGod created us as complex creatures, capable of feeling and sensing a whole garden of emotions. Made in the image of our Creator, we can both grieve the wrongs of this world, and celebrate the sweetness of this life. This 2-week reading plan will lead us through a series of passages from Scripture that examine the seasons of mourning and dancing in the life of a believer. In the written responses here on the site, our writers will enter into this tension, articulating their personal experiences with grief and joy in hopes of freeing you to explore your own. By immersing our hearts and minds in God’s Word, and honestly presenting our laments to Him, may we remember that God is present with us, He is good, and He is faithful. \n\nOn the day our daughter died, I planted flowers.\n\nIt was April in Tennessee, and the reality that my child was hanging in a precarious balance between life and death, in part because my womb was acting as her life support, was never far from my mind. That Monday morning, I kissed my husband and weekend guests out the door, then helped my toddler son get dressed and fed him yogurt and Cheerios for breakfast.\n\nEven while death was happening, so was life.\n\nThat Monday morning, we blew bubbles. We played on the swing set. I read a book on the back porch, and we snacked on strawberries. When my toddler was fast asleep in his crib, I slipped my hands into a pair of old gardening gloves, knelt in the dirt, and got to work with my spade. Bent over my pregnant belly, hands in the soil, the evidence of life kicked and turned within me. The gravity of the moment was lost on me at the time, but I see it now. \n\nPlanting. Acting on hope. Believing promises. Burying seeds in the darkness. Knowing a thing can only produce something beautiful if it dies first (John 12:24). Ecclesiastes 3 tells us there is a time for every matter under heaven.\n\nA time to be born, and a time to die.A time to plant, and a time to uproot.A time to weep, and a time to laugh.A time to mourn, and a time to dance.\n\nFor our precious daughter, that Monday afternoon in April was a time to die. For us, it was a time to mourn. But it was also a time to actively hope in promises that life comes from death. It was a time to dance because our child was in the presence of her Savior.\n\nThat day, not knowing what the night would hold, the Lord led me through the motions of actively hoping and believing that death brings life. An object lesson of the resurrection in my soil-covered hands, I could not have known these would be some of the last turns and kicks I’d ever feel. And so, I planted.\n\nLife and death are not respecters of each other. Mourning and dancing—they don’t always take turns. Not in my story, not in yours, not in our world. While people celebrate weddings and first steps and the sweetness of life, the broken world continues to break our hearts, sometimes at the very same time. The tension is there—wondering when to celebrate and when to cry. Often the best thing we can do is acknowledge that tension and do both, seeking the Lord as we navigate the complexities of this world.\n\nWe must never stop mourning brokenness. It is right to mourn. And we must never cease to celebrate life and beauty. It is right to dance. Because of Christ, life comes from death. Because of Christ, we will dance again.\n\n“Truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice.  You will become sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn to joy” (John 16:20).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nWhen I was nine, I had a theory that it always rained on Good Friday. And in my limited experience north of the Mason-Dixon line, it did rain on most Fridays before Easter. This made me believe that the earth was grieving, groaning, and remembering the world-altering death of Christ on that day. Looking up from my coloring book there at the dining room table to the cold, spring rain on our grass, I felt what I still feel today: sadness. \n\nA feeling of melancholy, sentimental or otherwise, over the death of Christ is certainly not an emotion unique to little girls in the Midwest. Christ’s misery was deeply painful to those who were with Him on that day, and is still real to us today. In his “Homily of the Passion,” second-century bishop Melito of Sardis wondered:\n\nWhat new mystery is this?The judge is judged and remains silent;The invisible one is seen and does not hide himself;The incomprehensible one is comprehended and does not resist;The unmeasurable one is measured and does not struggle;The one beyond suffering suffers and does not avenge himself;The immortal one dies and does not refuse death.What new mystery is this?\n\nWe can join the bishop in his wonder at this deep and painful mystery. And it is right that we should mourn. It is right that we want to turn away from the thought of Christ crucified. It is truly painful, and it’s the pain of the world turned upside down. Immortality gasping for breath means something has gone terribly wrong.\n\nThe wrong is written on our own foreheads. Every Ash Wednesday, we remember that we are the ones who are dust and ashes, that the sin that turned the world upside down is our sin. It is my sin—my daily run-of-the-mill gossip and petty jealousy. In spite of my horror and grief when I remember Christ’s suffering, I also rise up in joyous wonder that He has taken my place.\n\nThere is a tension here. We mourn at the pain of Christ’s suffering, but we dance—and I do mean dance—because we are restored by His sacrifice. My grief can turn to celebration because, like Paul, “I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me” (Galatians 2:20). What a glorious realization of our freedom! \n\nIt doesn’t matter whether or not I think it should rain on Good Friday as some symbol of cosmic mourning. What matters is that on a certain day, many years ago, the sky turned black (Matthew 27:45), the world was turned upside down, and the Son of God gave Himself for us. And in spite of our sadness, we will forever rejoice.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nI have a favorite sin.\n\nI want so badly to hate it, and sometimes I do. When I see its effects on the people I love, when I’m granted an objective view of its effects on my own heart, when I remember how utterly contrary to the gospel it is—those are the times my sin brings me to my knees. But on most days, any average, busy day, I ignore it. Not only that, I tend to it under the radar, taking care to subtly stoke its flame.\n\nIt’s the sin of self-absorption.\n\nThere are flashier sins out there, and I have plenty of those to repent of too. But my bent to only see the world as relative to me—what I think, what I need, what I hope, what I believe—has single-handedly caused more collateral damage than most of those other sins put together.\n\nIt is the sin I’ve used to belittle my children, putting my need for space and silence before their need for love and listening.\n\nIt is the sin I’ve used to put off my friends, glossing over their hurts and hard spots in favor of redirecting their eyes to my own.\n\nIt is the sin I’ve used to not love my neighbors, ignoring instead of listening, choosing indifference over engagement.\n\nIt is the sin I’ve used to quench the Holy Spirit, looking past conviction and clutching harder to my idols.\n\nThese aren’t just phrases on a screen. These are real choices made in real relationships with real people—people I’ve hurt in large and small ways when I cling to the shards of my shattered self instead of embracing the life Christ calls me to live. There are wounds I can’t mend, moments I can’t get back, words I can’t rewind. My sin is deep. My heart aches to think of the vastness of things done and left undone.\n\nScripture says the Lord examines our hearts. All manner of our sins are known to Him. And our holy God, knowing every ounce of our sin, must “give to each according to his way, according to what his actions deserve” (Jeremiah 17:10). And He did. But Christ intervened, taking the Father’s holy wrath on Himself.\n\nWhen Christ went to the cross, He wore the dirty rags of my attempts at righteousness, the stench of my selfishness, the weight of my blatant refusal to worship my Creator with all that I am. He suffered, not because God the Father is cruel, but because my sin was heinous and merited punishment. He bled, not because He was weak but because I am. He died, not because they executed Him, but because a sacrifice was required. When Christ went to the cross, He left nothing undone.\n\nI hate my sin. And I hate that I don’t always hate my sin. I am broken, not in a sweet, sentimental, sing-songy way, but in a real, painful, and pain-inducing way. I am broken in a way that often breaks the people around me. I am broken in a way that should, logically speaking, separate me from a holy God. But Christ’s death is not a legend, not a story we tell to sober us into false humility or ankle-deep love. No, Christ’s death is true. His death was full, complete. Our debt has been paid by Jesus’s death, and our hope has been eternally sealed by His resurrection.\n\nI weep with sorrow for my sin. I weep with joy for my redemption. And nothing, not even myself and my sin, will ever separate me from the love of God in Jesus Christ (Romans 8:35). Thanks be to Him. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Mortality and Life",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nThere is an Irish poet named John O’Donohue who writes blessings for many types of life experiences. In his piece “A Blessing for a Friend on the Arrival of Illness,” he says, “May you find in yourself a courageous hospitality towards what is difficult, painful, and unknown. May you use this illness as a lantern to illuminate the new qualities that will emerge in you.” \n\nMy friend Greg read this aloud at a songwriting retreat this spring, and the moment I heard it, I was moved. The poet’s words were at the same time deeply comforting and deeply provoking. Although Donohue was writing specifically of illness, his words spoke to the greater reality that each of our mortal bodies is slowly dying, yet there is wisdom and beauty to be harvested on the journey. We can use our mortality as a lantern. I don’t know about you, but I enjoy showing hospitality to others far more than I enjoy showing it to myself—especially to my fragile body. \n\nIn Psalm 103:15–16, the psalmist describes how our days are like the grass and flowers of the field that vanish. There is beauty in this fragility. But our modern culture is uncomfortable with our own mortality because we’re so removed from death—animal death, human death, even the death of our dreams. The American dream tells me I can have and do whatever my heart wants, but often what my heart wants is outside my control and slips through my fingers. It is like those grasses of the field. What endures is the life to come, our eternal inheritance that is sturdy and true and real enough to last. \n\nThough it’s easy to admire the seemingly timeless endurance of human achievements like the great cathedrals or other wonders of the world, knowing that my own skin and bones are more susceptible to death than these is something of a paradox. How strange that these artifacts would outlive the humans who built them. But this past summer, we observed how even the grandeur of Notre Dame was not enough to protect it from being partially consumed by fire. Even what appears timeless isn’t always so.\n\nWe would be without hope if it weren’t for the promised redemption of all things. Christ is making all things new. Scripture says that “Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away” (Revelation 21:4–5). The hope of new heavens and a new earth and new bodies doesn’t take away the sting of these current decaying ones, but it should relieve some of the despair attached to it. \n\nMay we show ourselves a courageous hospitality. May those deep, dark, dying places inside us reveal even deeper ways to enter into the love of Jesus, no matter what season we find ourselves in. Although the process is painful, it enlarges our understanding of God and what it means to be co-heirs with Christ and His coming, eternal kingdom. This is not all there is. Mourning will end in dancing, and death will end in life.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nMy very first memory is the day I became a sister. As soon as the birth of my baby brother was announced, I kicked open the maternity ward doors with my red Keds, singing, “I’m a Little Teapot” at the top of my lungs. He was the tiniest, sweetest, greatest thing to happen to my two-and-a-half-year-old life. \n\nA few years later, I’d be clever enough to replace the words in another favorite nursery rhyme, “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” with my own name and reality, singing, \n\nMary Kaitlin had a little brother,Had a little brother, had a little brother.Mary Kaitlin had a little brotherWho lived in her house too.\n\nI taught the song to my classmates, who’d sing it as I paraded through the elementary school carpool line, hand in hand with my little lamb. Some days I still wake up with this tune stuck in my head, rolling over to realize, yet again, the song’s taunting truth: I had a little brother—past tense. He’s gone now. \n\nIn the days following my brother’s death, the influx of sympathy cards, corn casseroles, news stories, pastoral visits, written obituaries, and floral arrangements all sang in unison, stuck on the same line: “Had a little brother, had a little brother, had a little brother.” \n\nDeath had stolen my song. \n\nDuring the funeral, I stood in the first church pew, ready to lace up my red Keds, kick open the sanctuary doors, and go claim my little brother. I decided it wasn’t too late for it to all be a big mistake. I was waiting for Grief to admit it had chosen the wrong family, for Tragedy to apologize, and for Sorrow to pack its bags. It all made more sense that way, because my brother was the kind of guy who’d blush at all this attention and giggle at the amount of formality. Or was he? I was already forgetting. \n\nMy thoughts are my most unreliable grief companion, with the capacity to be my sweetest advocate or my biggest traitor. Like having a sore muscle, I become afraid to make the next move, knowing that walking through memories has the power to heal, but it also has the power to hurt. \n\nInside the front door of our childhood home, there’s a piano, the bench cushion worn equally on both sides. Together, my brother and I had written our own rendition of “Heart and Soul”—he on the bass clef, me on the treble. I sit in the same spot now, alone, recalling all of my notes perfectly, the duet only heard in my head. I remember all of his notes too. And I’m reminded that I am still Mary Kaitlin, but I no longer have a little brother who lives in my house too. I feel like the psalmist, pounded by the waves:\n\n“Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your breakers and your billows have swept over me. The Lord will send his faithful love by day; his song will be with me in the night— a prayer to the God of my life” (Psalm 42:7–8).\n\nDeath can steal our song, but it cannot stop us from singing. And while I hold onto the hope of heaven, I am relieved and comforted by remembering God’s faithfulness to me in all things, right now.\n\nWhen I hear one of our old songs, sometimes I listen, and other times I don’t. But when I’m feeling brave, I begin to mouth the words of that childhood song about my little brother, and I’m reminded of the true root of my grief: love. And that’s something I’ll never forget. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nI stood with the other guests, sandals planted in the grass, finger pressed to the top of a can of Silly String, waiting in anticipation to see what emerged from the tip of the spout. Blue or pink? Blue or pink? \n\nTime and time again for the previous eighteen months, my husband and I had experienced a similar suspense in the privacy of our own home, waiting for the results. One line or two? One line or two? But there were no shouts of joy or photos taken. No blue Silly String raining down on our heads. Just the sound of plastic hitting the bottom of a trash can as another month closed on our dreams. \n\nAs our friends learned they would soon welcome a baby boy, I grabbed my husband’s hand and dragged him through their master bedroom, bathroom, and into the closet—not totally weird, since this particular gender reveal also doubled as a housewarming party. The place still smelled like paint. In my friends’ walk-in closet, shoes lined shelves on the left and right, all in perfect rows. Without warning, I began to sob, crumbling into my husband’s shoulder, laughing and crying at the same time as I realized I wanted everything they have.\n\nI’m not sure I know how to weep with those who weep and rejoice with those who rejoice. All too often, I do it all backwards, because this life is really, really hard, and I’m just barely keeping it together. I find I’m detached when others weep, never quite sure what to say or how to make it better. And I’m sad to say I’m jealous when others rejoice, disappointed with my own circumstances. \n\nI’m even worse with my own pain, minimizing it because I don’t want to burden other people. Downplaying my successes because I don’t want to seem vain or selfish. And God’s call to walk alongside others in their deepest sorrow and joy seems almost impossible (Romans 12:12–15). So for better or for worse, I fake it the best I can, hoping that someday my feelings will catch up to my actions.\n\nBut I think God wants so much more than for me to ignore my emotions. And He is most definitely not asking me to “fake it ‘til I make it.” He’s calling me to real emotion—to the odd, uncomfortable reality of holding grief and joy at the same time, without minimizing either experience, naming the good, the bad, and the ugly. This means allowing myself to feel the depth of my pain, so that, when the time comes, I will know what it means to grieve with my friends. \n\nBeing honest and vulnerable with our emotions isn’t easy. But ultimately, if we are real with Him—and with each other—every grief and every joy can transform into a glimpse of redemption. If I let it happen, every affliction can give me a greater capacity to care for and understand someone else’s pain. Every joy I allow myself to fully experience can give me a greater capacity to dance at someone else’s wedding.\n\nIn 2017, we brought home our son through adoption; we are writing a new story from many broken pieces. And yet, our journey with infertility is not over. Our bodies still don’t do what others can. But I’m learning that Christ is the ultimate empathizer. No one weeps with us and rejoices with us like He does. “For as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so our comfort overflows through Christ” (2 Corinthians 1:5). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nLifting the hammer up with both hands, I knocked the shelf loose from its fixed position. My screams had become muffled by the sobs caught in my throat, but through shallow breaths and clenched teeth, I made my complaints known and laid into Him.\n\nI want my babies! Where are they? Why do You give them to me if You’re only going to take them away?\n\nAfter our first miscarriage, I wept as I painted our bedroom walls, covering up the sunny yellow and replacing it with a controlled, subdued neutral. The linen closet received a welcome facelift and my wardrobe was purged, streamlined to a more manageable system for daily use. After years of unexplained infertility, I was told to be happy I’d gotten pregnant in the first place. Chin up, Buttercup. Let’s soldier on.\n\nBut this second miscarriage, four months later, was different. I felt utterly unhinged, untethered to anything. Forgotten. And so I drifted violently across the kitchen floor, from cabinet to cabinet and shelf to shelf, re-organizing and reordering, wielding a hammer and railing on my Maker.\n\nYears passed, and I grew numb. Empty. And very sick, it turns out. I found myself in a neurologist’s office with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. What’s more, my doctor discovered an anomaly in my blood work. An autoimmune disease and now an antibody—the doctor believed that together, they’d caused me to miscarry.\n\nHe may have been right. Three months into being on my MS meds, and without trying, I became pregnant with identical twin girls. I laughed out loud as my obstetrician pointed out two fluttering heartbeats on the ultrasound. I laughed, and I promise you, I heard Him laugh too.\n\nPain, loss, and affliction—I know them well. We all do because they’re a promised byproduct of life here in a fallen world (John 16:33). They come tangled up with joy and abundance and blessing. I’ve tried to extricate the good from the seemingly bad, but to no avail. They’re a packaged deal.\n\nSo while my dream of having children has been realized, and then some, I still have multiple sclerosis. Now, being well enough to keep up with our girls the way I’d always imagined is a struggle, a deep shame I do battle with daily.\n\nThis is my Ebenezer: my affliction, healing, and blessing bound together in a monument to Him and for His glory (Genesis 35:14; 1 Samuel 7:3–12). It’s here that I’ve wrestled with my God and have come to know Him face to face. I cannot praise Him and thank Him for our girls without praising and thanking Him for my diagnosis of MS. Learning to do so will no doubt take a lifetime. \n\nHe’s chosen to weave great joy into deep sorrow. This forces me to wonder if my affliction and physical limitations are somehow God’s kindness to me (2 Corinthians 12:5–10)—constant reminders that my body, this temporal world, and everything in it are fading away. Meanwhile, the eternal wages on, refreshed and renewed, out in the open air and light of His presence. “Therefore we do not give up. Even though our outer person is being destroyed, our inner person is being renewed day by day” (2 Corinthians 4:16).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nI was once a well-oiled working machine, churning out articles, speaking at conferences, ministering within my capacity and out of my weaknesses and strengths. While I’d never envisioned myself as an unmarried woman, I found fullness and contentment in the plot God had given me to tend.\n\nThen I got married. And moved. And moved again. I’m no longer in my home, or church, or comfort zone. I still don’t really know anyone here, and we haven’t found a local church home in the D.C. area yet. We feel displaced.\n\nMeanwhile, all the work that’s been done in me and through me is suddenly no longer for me. I can’t write about singleness anymore. I’ve begun to see others picking up the banner I laid down for the gift of marriage—and I’ve resented myself for losing it. My heart echoes King Solomon’s words: \n\n“I hated all my work that I labored at under the sun because I must leave it to the one who comes after me. And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will take over all my work that I labored at skillfully under the sun. This too is futile” (Ecclesiastes 2:18–19).\n\nThere is this sadness in me that I cannot shake. The earthly identity I worked hard to build, and tried my best to bear faithfully, is no longer mine to carry. Those days of fruitful ministry feel very far behind me across the chasm of this difficult year. The enemy loves to taunt me, to tell me I’ve wasted and been wasted, that all those words and thoughts are now lost. It’s hard to trust that my previous work has not been done in vain, though I know it was never mine to begin with. It was always His. \n\nI dreamt of this time for years, didn’t I? I longed to be married. Why then is it so hard to reconcile the work I once did with the work I’m called to now? I agonize over how to spend the eleven-hour days stretching from the still-dark hours through sunset when my husband returns. I sweep the kitchen floor, wash the towels, and put fresh flowers in the vase, growing weary and resentful of all I’ve lost, straining to remember that I’ve also gained. Happy as my husband and I are together, happy as I am to be called his wife, this place in life is still not our true home. It isn’t supposed to be. \n\nToday I do four loads of laundry. I sweep the kitchen floor. I write. I text Nate and our friends to tell them I love them, that I’m praying for them. I heed King Solomon’s words: “Whatever your hands find to do, do with all your strength” (Ecclesiastes 9:10). But in my struggle as a new stay-at-home wife, I remember that work is still work, no matter the title, no matter how blessed. God explained this to Adam at the fall, that the work of his hands would be hard from then on (Genesis 3:17). And it still is, for all of us. It will be until the day in Glory when pain in all its forms is no more (Revelation 21:4). \n\nSometimes the days drag on, the work feels endless. I can’t sort through the mountain of to-dos quickly enough, and yet it feels like I’m searching for things to do with my hands. But this is the plot to which I am called today: this home, this house, this husband. It is a life both better and harder than I imagined, and it’s being redeemed by God with every light and heavy step along the way. “For it is God who is working in [us] both to will and to work according to his good purpose” (Philippians 2:13).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nSome moments have a ripple effect. As a thrown stone breaks the glassy surface of water causing rings to swell and radiate to the shore, some moments break through us and the ripples radiate for days, months, even a lifetime.\n\nYears ago, a distinguished professor who’d been visiting our church agreed to come lead our small group for the evening. I don’t remember his initial topic that night, but as we lingered in conversation, the discussion soon turned to his travels, specifically his time in India. Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the crushing poverty and mind-boggling crowds of men and women and their children, begging in the streets all around him. His voice trembled as he described the enormity of human suffering he’d witnessed there. The heartbreaking stories he shared left mental images of miles of poverty and millions of suffering souls.\n\nAfter the meeting, I pulled the professor aside and confessed how utterly overwhelmed I was after hearing his stories. I shared how I’d been strangely burdened by the concept of suffering since I was a young girl. “How can this be?” I asked him. “Where is God in the midst of all this? And how on earth can we even begin to enter in and respond to such enormous injustice and suffering?”\n\nThe mild-mannered, soft-spoken professor snapped his head toward me, his eyes piercing and focused. “No,” he declared. “Being overwhelmed by suffering is no excuse for doing nothing.” He explained that there will always be more need than we can meet. But that does not mean we aren’t called to enter in and do the things we are able to do right now. His words landed hard. They felt like a rebuke because they were. To be paralyzed by the harsh reality of suffering, to be stuck inwardly condemning global injustice while doing nothing to alleviate it, is not an option God gives us.\n\nGod doesn’t sugarcoat the pain and brokenness of the world. He calls out evil, suffering, and injustice (Proverbs 6:16–19). He shines a light on those who are lonely, abandoned, oppressed, and poor (James 1:27). He knows the desperation, the dire circumstances, and the darkness we encounter, both in global proportions and in our most intimate and personal daily struggles (Psalm 139:12). Our God knows we need rescue. And Christ scandalously declares, \n\n“The Spirit of the Lord is on me,  because He has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners  and recovery of sight for the blind,  to release the oppressed,  to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”\n– Luke 4:18–19\n\nBecause He has solidarity with us, we can offer solidarity to the hurting.Because He defends us, we can defend others.Because He is our ultimate Judge, we can fight for justice.Because He is our hope, we can hold on to hope for ourselves and extend it to others.\n\nChrist entered in to rescue us. And the ripple effect of that rescue goes on and on. Thanks be to God alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI didn’t adopt because I wanted to make orphans miserable. But in the bumpy jostle of daily family life, between Don’t wake the baby! and Everyone get in bed!, I feel like I’m failing. We pursued adoption because we wanted to help—we wanted to make the world a better place, to shine the light of the gospel. But I didn’t know I would need to shine the light of the gospel at 5am, every day, for so many years. In the process, my flashlight has grown dull and weak.\n\nEvery day, my husband and I feel the pendulum swing between the tension of Christ’s invitation to “come away by yourselves to a remote place and rest for a while,” and His admonition to “meet together” in fellowship (Mark 6:31; Hebrews 10:25). After one too many family activities ending in disaster, we’ve learned to let our wounds heal in private and decline the next dinner invitation. \n\nAdoptive parenting has been the most difficult task of my life. It’s been astonishingly isolating, because from the outside, we look like an adorable, bustling, young family. But underneath, I’m clenching my teeth, waiting for the shoe to drop and the next terrible thing to happen. During this season, we’ve felt the tension of pulling out of community activities, playdates, dinners, and visits with family. And I fear that folks won’t understand we are dealing with more than just a case of the wiggles.\n\nBut in pulling away from community, we miss out on the real, loving, encouragement and affirmation we need from our people. We imagine disapproval in their eyes and judgment on their brows. Again and again, I have wanted to hide our messy family life because I am sure no one will understand. \n\nOne May day just a few years ago, my very, very cute adopted son was singing—with perfect pitch—a Christmas song, while I stood in the checkout line at Goodwill. He has a face like a chipmunk and a voice like a chorister, and he knows it. He’d been singing that song for weeks, and now he was shining his face around to draw the attention and approval of the other adults standing nearby. His endless fishing for applause from strangers touches on my fear that he’s still not quite settled on us as his parents; he’s still interviewing for the position. \n\nAlthough we can never erase the brokenness that led to his birth parents’ inability to raise him, we are the parents that God has given him. In spite of my commitment to love him, his singing was exhausting and painful at the end of a draining day—on top of six wearying years. For me, his song felt like a jarring syncopation, rattling out the death of my dreams. I asked him to stop singing.\n\nAt my left elbow, a woman snorted and leaned away from me. “That sweet little boy wasn’t hurting anything. You should know better than to stop him from singing!” she admonished, shaking her head and looking away. I felt my tired shoulders slump lower, even more resolved to hide our troubled story.\n\nAnd we have found relief and safety in solitude. We’ve been able to rally our forces and find heart for the next fight. But pulling away from community robs us of its gifts, and neglecting solitude robs us of its replenishing powers.\n\nSo we live in the in-between tension of the two. We live like a child on a swing, swaying out a little further and retreating a little further, learning to trust our community and learning to accept the peace of solitude.The further we venture out, the deeper we need to retreat afterward. We don’t have an easy solution, but I am sure about which direction to look for hope. “Come to Me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest,” Jesus says (Matthew 11:28). But in this in-between, our hearts are broken every single day. We are rejected and we are befriended. We are lonely and we are loved.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nLast week, my friend Jonathan and I were exchanging messages on Instagram. He recently moved to Austin, Texas, and I was eager to hear stories of good fortune that would render such a gutsy move successful. “Are you seeing lots of fruit in your new life?” I asked. As soon as I’d asked the question, my expectations felt too narrow. I wanted “fruit” to mean visible, positive affirmation of the right choice. Instead of answering directly, Jonathan shared some meandering thoughts typical of his introspective personality. “There’s never enough fruit to me. I heard Matthew McConaughey say that Austinites should focus on contributing more than consuming. I think he nailed it.” \n\nMy friend then put the question back on me: “So, how would you define fruit?” I was grateful for the push-back but also low-grade irritated—mostly because I didn’t feel like using my brain that late in the day. Now I had to confront, and possibly deconstruct, what I thought I meant, because my friend was just shrewd enough (and kind enough) not to leave me holding onto a half-baked idea.\n\nJesus loved a good, piercing question. Certainly, some of them were rhetorical, leaving people in a tongue-tied state like the ancient Near Eastern version of a mic drop. Some of them required a response right then and there. All of them were meant to go straight for the heart. “Who do the people say the Son of Man is?” Jesus asked His disciples while in Caesarea Philippi (Matthew 16:13). \n\nAt the time, there were lots of rumors about who Jesus was: John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah (v.14). The disciples knew from the Prophets that the Messiah would have a “vast” dominion and establish a kingdom with “justice and righteousness” (Isaiah 9:7), but they didn’t know how this would play out specifically. \n\nJesus didn’t ask the disciples who people thought the Son of Man was because He needed to know. It was a tool for unearthing His second question: “But you… who do you say that I am?” (Matthew 16:15). In the end, it doesn’t matter what everybody else thinks. Each of us must answer Jesus’s question for ourselves.\n\nSimon Peter was convinced that Jesus was the Messiah, “the Son of the living God” (v.16), and Scripture tells us that he didn’t just get the answer right by chance. It was the Father, not “flesh and blood,” that had done its work in Peter and revealed this divine knowledge (v.17). \n\nI’m so grateful for Jesus—and for thoughtful friends on Instagram—who ask penetrating questions that have our best interests in mind. Ones that weed out hearsay, clichés, and half-truths to get to the important questions somewhere below. I’m grateful that our Lord is always most concerned with our one-on-one relationship with Him and longs for us to seek and trust His voice above all others.\n\n“So, how do you define bearing fruit?” “Who do you say that I am?”\n\nThese questions lead to the type of knowledge and divine connections that Christ is building His beautiful Church upon.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nMy sister and I hopped onto the genetic-testing train last year. For Christmas, we gave our parents test kits and joined over twelve million customers in search of our ancestry. We are a people fascinated by our origins, hungry for the past to shed light on our present. \n\nFamily heritage held deep, sacred meaning for ancient Jewish people as well. While the modern identity question is, “Who am I?”, the defining question of ancient Israel was, “Whose am I?” Just read the detailed genealogies in the Old Testament. From Abraham to Ruth to David—origins, birthrights, and family connections formed identity and destiny. \n\nSo, it’s no wonder that Jesus’s listeners confidently held out their status as Abraham’s descendants and flashed it as their badge of honor and worth. Yet this over-dependence on heritage was dangerous. It offered a false sense of security, a misguided sense of racial superiority, and spiritual blindness.\n\nOne of Jesus’s disciples, John, records how many Jews were in denial of their need for rescue. They would not accept Jesus’s controversial teaching, which told them that even they, God’s chosen people, were spiritually lost and in desperate need of a Savior. When told that the truth would set them free, they bristled and held up their heritage as proof of their right standing with God. They told Jesus, “We are Abraham’s descendants… and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say, ‘You will become free’?” (John 8:33).\n\nJesus does more than poke holes in their heritage badges. He blasts the shaky ground they are standing on and reveals the true, firm foundation that provides the only way of salvation. Ancestry does not determine identity and destiny. But there is something—Someone—who does. And so Jesus answers them: “Truly I tell you, before Abraham was, I am” (v.58). \n\nBoom! His Jewish challengers are no doubt shocked by His outrageous claims. How could this man say these things? Jesus is equating Himself with Yahweh, leaving no room for misunderstanding. This man from Nazareth has the audacity to echo the words of God, who spoke to Moses through a burning bush and revealed His own name, “I AM WHO I AM” (Exodus 3:14). They know exactly what Jesus is claiming—that He, not a bloodline from Abraham, is the way of salvation and true freedom. \n\nWe, too, should be stunned, jolted by Jesus’s words. They are scandalous. But our family tree and our connections don’t define us. What we do, where we come from, who we associate with—none of these things can make us right with God. This is personal, and this is cosmic. We need a rescue from outside of ourselves, what theologian Martin Luther called an “alien righteousness.”\n\n“For this reason God highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,  so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow—in heaven and on earth and under the earth— and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father” (Philippians 2:9–11). \n\nWe do have a sure identity, which means we also have a sure destiny. The risen Christ defines us as beloved children of God, and we are destined to have a place around His table, dwelling with Him forever. He is our firm foundation. He is our righteousness. He sets us free. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nIn the whimsical, little village of Carmel-by-the-Sea, there’s a restaurant called Forge in the Forest. And, yes, it looks exactly like it sounds. It has a courtyard reminiscent of Disneyland’s Pixie Hollow, full of creeping vines and flowers and string lights. One of my students had recommended the place in a food review, so my friend and I pretty much planned our whole trip around having dinner there. After a day of sightseeing and beach-combing, we were way beyond that point of hunger in which you can barely form cohesive sentences. So, as you can imagine, we were giddy after ordering bacon burgers, a balsamic beet salad the size of a hoola-hoop, and chocolate lava cake garnished with raspberries. Of that meal, all I can say is, “Praise God from whom all blessings flow”—I’ll just leave it at that.\n\nBefore Jesus feeds the five thousand near the Sea of Galilee, He notices the crowd’s physical needs. “Where will we buy bread so that these people can eat?” he asks Philip (John 6:5). Once the disciples spot a young boy with food, Jesus uses five barley loaves and some fish to nourish the crowd’s physical hunger. He knew they wouldn’t be able to listen well if they were starving. This meal was an act of care and an entryway into relationship, where He would begin to nourish them spiritually.\n\nIn fact, providing above and beyond for this crowd was enough to convince them that Jesus was, in fact, the Messiah. When they saw this miracle, they said, “This truly is the Prophet who is to come into the world” (v.14). Throughout Scripture, bread is a common motif used to demonstrate God’s provision and sustenance—whether that’s the Israelites’ “bread from heaven” in the desert (v.31) or a mountainside meal. Jesus goes as far as to tell the disciples that He is the bread of life (v.35). \n\nOne of the earliest heresies in the church was the belief that the spiritual realm is good while the material world is evil. But we live in fragile bodies that have needs, and the way of Jesus is distinctly earthy. He walked along the dirt and fed people with fish and broke bread to symbolize His own body (Luke 22:19). Jesus doesn’t neglect the physical world for the spiritual world. This place we live in—a world with cinnamon bark and praying mantises and fresh basil—is the setting God created for us to encounter Him. \n\nWe have physical needs and spiritual needs, and Jesus offers to meet these while teaching us a higher way of living. Although our physical needs are great, Jesus is the nourishment that sustains us far beyond just alleviating our hunger pangs. How kind of Him to offer Himself in a way that makes little sense to us on one level, yet is exactly what we need Him to be: our “bread of life” (John 6:35), the only sustenance we will every truly need.\n\nAlthough there wasn’t anything particularly spiritual about that meal at Forge in the Forest, I felt God’s pleasure as I ate it. The same God who designs intricate plant life so that we can garnish our cake with raspberries also gave Himself up for us out of love. May we always remember that. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nDon’t get me wrong—I love the change of seasons and readily welcome autumn, but when summer begins to deflate, I want to grab on to every last drop. And then, when we begin losing daylight at a rate of two minutes per day (ugh!), I am absolutely done for. Shorter, colder days force us to come inside early and remember what it’s like to live in the darkness. Am I the only one who’s still a little afraid of the dark? \n\nYou and I both know we’re not strangers to the darkness. We see it every day, in every season. It’s in our conflicts and our diagnoses, our best intentions and our hurt feelings. Maybe winter feels harder because it’s just a stark, visual reflection of our sinful reality. Left to our own devices, we are people wandering in darkness (Isaiah 9:2). Since the fall in the garden, we have all been scrounging around in the pitch-black of our sin and shame, our souls in danger of never truly seeing light again.\n\nBut here’s what I love about the gospel: Just as we sometimes see a visual representation of the sinful nature of our souls, God gives us an everlasting image of redemption and hope in His Son, Jesus. In the Gospel of John, we read:\n\n“Jesus spoke to them again: “‘I am the light of the world. Anyone who follows me will never walk in the darkness but will have the light of life’” (John 8:12).\n\nLet’s jump in with a little bit of context here: Jesus is speaking to a crowd that included Jewish religious leaders. He is in the temple complex, and the Feast of Tabernacles is taking place. The Jews had been debating His identity because of the miracles people had seen and the authority with which He spoke. And now Jesus gives them one more outrageous statement to debate: “I am the light of the world.”\n\nLight was an important symbol in the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles (Leviticus 23:33–44), signifying the pillar of fire given to Israel during the exodus (Exodus 13:21). But here in John chapter 8, Jesus is saying that He Himself is the light given to His children, illuminating the way to eternal life. His declaration is for us as well. \n\nNow, we, as beloved children of Christ, have seen the great light of life set before us. Let us hold on to Him, our only sure hope in the midst of darkness. He is our light in this life and our eternal salvation, our stronghold in the face of all fear and dread (Psalm 27:1). May He awaken us from the darkness of our sin and our slumber of ambivalence (Ephesians 5:13–14).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nSheep don’t know a gate from a fence row. As a midwestern sheep farmer, I can tell you this for certain. A recent run-in with a wayward sheep proves my point. Because the proverbial grass is always greener on the other side, our sheep are constantly stretching their necks to try to nibble the grass outside the fence. Occasionally, one will barrel through the wire to get to the “good stuff” she’s been denied.\n\nSo it was that we discovered one of our sheep outside the pen one hot day this summer. The solution should have been easy. We simply opened the gate. But due to stubbornness or oblivion, the ewe remained outside the fold. We called and whooped, summoning her back to the comfort and safety of her flock. Instead, she kept ramming herself into the fence. Time and time again. The gate was wide open, but she defaulted to futile attempts to make her own way.\n\nCreation is constantly teaching us (Romans 1:20), and when it comes to revealing who Jesus is, sheep are especially good instructors. No wonder Jesus frequently asked us to envision sheep pens as He revealed His identity as “the gate for the sheep” (John 10:7). Long before Jesus spoke these words, David, once a shepherd, saw the character of the Lord (and his own identity) illustrated through his flock: “The LORD is my shepherd; I have what I need” (Psalm 23:1).\n\nThe theme woven throughout Scripture is this: we are like sheep, prone to wander from the fold in search of false hope that can never fully satisfy. Because our Shepherd is good, the gate to salvation is open, but we’ll never find it on our own. We try to be self-sufficient, to do all the good deeds, and we may even convince ourselves for a time that we’ve got our stuff together more than someone else. But the reality is, when left to our own devices, we will just keep ramming ourselves up against false hope and good intentions.\n\nJesus shows us the gate—no, actually, Jesus is the gate. He is the way. Listen for His call. Submit to His leading. Quit stubbornly ramming yourself up against your own plans. Instead, look to Jesus and enter in. He whispers to us, “I am the gate. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will come in and go out and find pasture” (John 10:9).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Guest Writer\n\nSometimes a song undoes me. Certain lyrics and melodies have a way of releasing the yearnings of my heart. So it is with these words from Robert Robinson’s hymn, “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing”: “Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it. / Prone to leave the God I love.” \n\nMy wandering makes me ache. \n\nIs it any wonder that God’s people are called sheep so often in the Bible? Sheep need a shepherd. Without guidance, they easily wander and become lost. Don’t we also veer off into uncharted territory and become disoriented? Our agendas, worries, and unbelief all lead us away from dependence on Jesus, and soon we don’t know which way to turn. \n\nSheep need a protector. It is dangerous for them to stray from their shepherd’s care. Unlike animals with sharp claws or speedy legs, sheep are vulnerable and defenseless. If left alone, they will likely be attacked and killed by wild animals. \n\nWe, too, have a predator, an enemy of our souls. Scripture tells us to “be sober-minded, be alert. Your adversary the devil is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for anyone he can devour” (1 Peter 5:8). We need a Shepherd to guide us, keep us in the fold, and protect us from our enemy.\n\nSheep also need a provider. They often cannot find clean water or nourishing grass on their own. They struggle to care for themselves. If sheep stumble and fall over, they cannot get back up and will die on the ground with their short legs sticking up in the air. \n\nWhen faced with our own suffering and confusion, we also can find ourselves wrestling in the dusty dirt of life, struggling to get back on our feet. Like sheep, we need a Shepherd to make us lie down in green pastures and rest, to lead us beside quiet waters and renew us (Psalm 23:2–3).\n\nDavid wrote the poetry of Psalm 23, and he intimately understood shepherding. As a boy, he tended his father’s sheep (1 Samuel 16:1–13). As King of Israel, he shepherded a nation. And in the midst of his own wandering, he wrestled in the dirt of his sin and brokenness, and realized just how desperately he needed a Shepherd (2 Samuel 11, Psalm 51).\n\nThrough the words of His prophet, Ezekiel, God graciously promises, “I myself will search for my flock and look after them” (Ezekiel 34:11). Jesus boldly echoes His Father and reveals His divine identity as He declares, “I am the good shepherd” who “lays down his life for the sheep” (John 10:11). \n\nLike David, Jesus lovingly tends his Father’s sheep. Like David, Jesus wrestled in the dirt of sin—but it wasn’t His sin. It was ours. Jesus conquered sin and death, just as John the Baptist boldly proclaimed He would: “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29) The Good Shepherd willingly became the ultimate sacrificial Lamb to atone for our sin and make the way for His people to be right with God, to bring His sheep safe within the fold.\n\nYes, I ache when I wander. But I also rejoice when I recognize my Shepherd’s voice. Jesus said, “My sheep hear my voice, I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27). His words ring true. His voice undoes me. What a Good Shepherd, what a Savior!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nThis past summer, I attended the SING! Conference, hosted by Keith and Kristyn Getty. While there, I heard Joni Eareckson Tada cast a vision for what the resurrection must mean for the physically and mentally disabled. She shared how the first thing she hoped to do in heaven after regaining the use of her legs was to kneel before God. This was because, growing up in church traditions that made space for confessional kneeling, she was not able to participate in this part of the liturgy, although her confidence in God’s goodness was obvious. I believe the resurrection, which means a literal “raising up,” has a secondary layer of beauty for those who cannot raise themselves physically now. \n\nWhen Martha confesses belief that her brother Lazarus will rise again on the last day, Jesus tells her that He is “the resurrection and the life” (John 11:25). Although Martha already believed in the coming resurrection, she didn’t appear to fully understand that Christ Himself was the embodiment of it. I imagine this is why Jesus explains how those who believe in Him will live on even after death and asks her: “Do you believe this?” (v.26).\n\nThe idea of Jesus raising her brother from the dead that day was almost too good to be true for Martha. It was a big ask. Her cheeks still wet with tears of grief, she knew that she would see her brother again, but it felt like hoping against hope that Jesus would revive his breath when so many others didn’t get that privilege. Four days in, surely Lazarus was gone (v.17). \n\nTo Martha, the resurrection at the end of history was a detached concept. It provided her with hope, but only a futuristic hope that barely touched her present grief. Jesus surprised her by bringing her brother back to life with the simple command of “Lazarus, come out!” (v.44).\n\nOne of my best friends told me once that “Truth is a Man.” It’s always stuck with me. Although, for some, Christianity may just be a system of strung together theological concepts (our human attempt to understand God), the center of the gospel is the person of Jesus Christ—who has skin and bones. Our whole faith history, before and after the incarnation, must now be interpreted through that earth-shattering event. This Man, who is also fully God, has the power to resurrect all things—our physical bodies and hearts and even the empty places that don’t have a name. \n\nWhether, like Joni Earechson Tada, you’re one of the walking wounded who feel stuck or held back by physical and mental disadvantages, or you simply feel the toll of being human, the hope of the resurrection is that it is here, now—because He is here, now. Because Christ is in us, the same Spirit’s power that raised Him from the dead is in us, too (Romans 8:11). What a crazy and humbling thought that is. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\n“What are you looking for?” seems like a harmless question when you’re, say, on all fours looking for the back of an earring in a crowded elevator. Or maybe when your bike has been stolen and you’re filling out a police report detailing its exact size, color, and last known location.\n\nBut when it comes to something you’ve never had before, like a dream job or a new friend, it can be hard to articulate exactly what you’re hoping to find. What I know for sure is that every time I sit across from an attractive, intelligent man on a first date, I dread them asking, “So… what are you looking for?” What I’ve figured out is that the question beneath the question is actually, “Is it me?” And no… it’s not terrifying or too soon to be asking that question on a first date—nope, not all.\n\nWhat I find interesting, though, is that this question, this posture of seeking, is ingrained in us. Ever since the fall, humanity has found itself lacking, and thus, we have found ourselves searching for who knows what: Chocolate. Caffeine. Ibuprofen. Adventure. Love. Fulfillment. Belonging. Healing. Our need is not a surprise to us. \n\nI don’t think that any of God’s children would have been able to specifically ask for who we need as a Savior. Sure, we would’ve been able to come up with characteristics, such as someone who is “forgiving” or “loving” or even someone who is “just” in the way they interact with the world and others. But our minds are unable to understand just how great our need is, let alone the compassion and longing God has for us. He had more in store for us than just fulfilling our needs—He wanted to do so in a way that would teach us about His character, draw us to His love, and keep us in His embrace forever. \n\nAs His disciples encountered Jesus while feeling their own human needs, they probably had a lot of questions come to mind:\n\nWhich way is right? What can I believe to be absolutely true? How can I find real life in a fallen world? \n\nJesus answers our fears with this calming reassurance in the beginning of John 14: “Don’t let your heart be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me” (v.1). He is capable of showing us the way, revealing to us the truth, and giving us life abundantly—and that would have been enough, more than we deserve. But He still wants more for us. He wants us to know Him in relationship. \n\nI love what Charles Spurgeon has to say about the way Jesus talks to His disciples here: “Thus we notice how they speak to him with a natural, easy familiarity; and he talks to them in full sympathy with their weakness, teaching them little by little as they are able to learn. They ask just such questions as a boy might ask of his father. Often they show their ignorance, but never do they seem timid in his presence, or ashamed to let him see how shallow and hard of understanding they are.”\n\nJesus knows what we are searching for, even when we don’t have a clue. When we ask, “Where is the path? What is true? How can I find life?”, He will always answer, “It is me.” He alone is “the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebekah Lyons\n\nA few Septembers ago, one lazy afternoon during Shabbat, I strolled along a path through a biblical garden in Israel. We’d been there for a week, staying at that gorgeous kibbutz overlooking the Emmaus road, inspired by the garden and the community that lived and worked there.\n\nAs I walked alone, the wind picked up from the east, fast and furious. I stopped in my tracks, as if Jesus were about to stroll around the bend, white robe and hair flowing, to offer me a bear hug. A girl can dream, yes? Minutes later, my eyes landed on a branch dangling in front of me; I was standing beneath a grape arbor canopied with a roof of vines overhead. \n\nI looked more closely and noticed a tiny leaf, torn almost in two. At the bottom of the leaf, a green vine had wrapped itself in a ball around the torn part, binding the tear and holding the leaf close against itself. I got choked up. For years I suffered with panic disorder while living in New York City, and I’d always describe myself as “untethered,” flailing and fleeting like that torn leaf.\n\nI ran to gather the rest of my group, to show them this gift of analogy. Our guide, Arie, joined us with bright eyes and zeal, eager for any teachable moment. He shared that the nature of the vine when it touches something, is to begin wrapping itself around it, making them one.\n\nThat year, I’d been reading Dutch missionary Andrew Murray’s book, Abide in Christ, excavating my soul and learning how this vine-and-branch thing works. My encounter with the little vine that day reminded me of this passage from Murray’s book: “My entire life, I thought my closeness with Jesus was dependent upon me. But Jesus’s love draws us in for one thing: to come into His presence and His rest. That’s it. How many of us could use a little soul rest? And when we do come, the Vine takes the reins from there; He pulls us close and tethers us to Himself.” \n\nThe greatness doesn’t stop there. This tethering becomes provision, meaning all the nutrients of heaven are offered to us right now, to renew us and bring us back to life. Jesus gives us everything we need in life to push back the darkness (2 Peter 1:3). He is “the true vine” who gently binds us to Himself (John 15:1). He brings forth fruit, grown from the life He’s given us, to then bring nourishment to the world. Jesus does it all. Fruit never comes from our own making—it grows to the measure we let Him grow it in us (v.5). \n\nWhat a beautiful relief! The old covenant was about what we bring to Him—our annual offering, our covering of sin to become restored with God—but the new covenant is all about what Jesus brings to us. His offering. His blood to cover our sin. His righteousness credited to us, declaring us right with God. May we stop striving today and rest in the grip of the Vine’s loving-kindness.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nAge has taught me that I don’t need a smaller view of my problems—I need a bigger view of God. Few truths comfort me more than the fact that God is infinite. He extends indefinitely in all directions; past and present, before and behind. Though the thought is truly mind boggling, Scripture is clear: He has always been. \n\nGod has no beginning, no point of origin. There was no “before” Him. There can never be an “after.” No one breathed life into His lungs, and no one can take His life from Him. “He is before all things, and by him all things hold together” (Colossians 1:17). He is both the first and the last (Isaiah 44:6). He is “the Alpha and the Omega… the beginning and the end” (Revelation 22:13). He was and He is, and is He coming again (Revelation 1:4).\n\nThough God created time, He stands outside of it. Since my finite mind cannot grasp His expanse, I like to think of Him like a paper-towel-roll God. Go ahead, grab the empty paper towel roll from your kitchen counter to see what I mean. Hold it up. Look at it from end to end and consider this: This is God’s view of our lives. \n\nThe Alpha and Omega existed before us. He will exist long after our earthly days are done. He can effortlessly see our lives from beginning to end, like glancing through a cardboard tube. This means our infinite God stands outside of temporary troubles. There is no heartache that can outlast Him, and no hurt He wasn’t around to see.\n\nBut as vast and incomprehensible as our Creator God is, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to put on flesh and dwell with us, to die for us, and to save us from sin and death. “He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation… all things have been created through him and for him” (Colossians 1:15–16).\n\nA bigger view of God turns my heart toward worshiping Him. That worship often boomerangs back as peace within my own heart. Every fear and worry we will face today, every insult and besetting sin—everything is fleeting. The things of this world are already circling the drain. Our lives are just a blip on the timeline of eternity, yet each of us matters to Him, our Creator. God, in contrast, is the end-all-be-all, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. Today we can rest in His goodness and constancy. We can rest in His power and His “bigness,” and that is no small thing.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nI was five years old, standing with my mom and brother in a pew near the front of the sanctuary. We were singing a hymn and I had my eyes closed, my hands held in front of me with my palms facing up as if carrying an invisible tray. This is my earliest memory of worship. \n\nI didn’t know to call it that. I was just responding to the reality of who God showed Himself to be. Somehow—maybe through the Scripture read from the pulpit or a truth proclaimed in that hymn, or maybe through whispers from the Holy Spirit to my heart—I caught a glimpse of God, big and strong and holy, but also good and loving. I felt connected to Him, like I knew Him and He knew me. It didn’t matter that I was small; I knew right then that I was His, and my heart responded in kind. \n\nThat moment in my memory marks the beginning of a lifelong journey of worship, of learning to respond to God with all of myself. There are times this resembles that day in the church pew, my heart swelling in worship as the pipe organ plays and the congregation sings. More often it takes a subtler form, a different shape of surrender for each circumstance and season. Sometimes my worship is misplaced; like a train without tracks, I give my awe and reverence to something other than my Creator. \n\nScripture makes it clear that we are to worship nothing and no one other than the one true God. He is the only one worthy of our worship. \n\n“To whom will you compare me, or who is my equal?” asks the Holy One. Look up and see! Who created these? He brings out the stars by number; he calls all of them by name. Because of his great power and strength, not one of them is missing.” –Isaiah 40:25–26\n\nBut if worship is indeed more than singing on Sunday morning, what is it? Jesus told the Samaritan woman at the well that true worshipers worship “in Spirit and in truth” (John 4:23). How do we worship with a heart tuned to the Spirit of the Lord and tethered to the truth of His Word? \n\nThese are the questions we will explore in this study of what it means to worship God. Each day we will read about an aspect of worship from Scripture, spending time reflecting on what it looks like in our lives. While these two weeks will not give us an exhaustive look at the topic of worship in the Bible, our prayer is that we’ll walk away with a fuller understanding of what “worship in spirit and in truth” means for us and the God who made us. \n\nLike that little girl with hands stretched out, I am still learning how to worship. Join me as we learn together, and may our lives reflect more of God’s goodness and glory as a result. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sandra McCracken\n\nMy emotions have been a bit up and down lately. I’ve been writing songs in fits and starts, leaving chords and scribbled notes in papers on the piano, unfinished and forgotten. This is an especially dynamic time for our family as we have recently welcomed a new baby. But as we shift into this new season of life, I find I am once again comforted by chords and lyrics, by the act of praising and worshiping God through them. I find rest when I call to mind these words from the psalmist: “For the word of the LORD is right and true; he is faithful in all he does” (Psalm 33:4 NIV). Our God has made all things with His own hands, and with every new season and turning of our lives, He invites us to sing a new song to Him.\n\nIn the midst of all these changes, I try to live in the moment, to be present and take it all in stride. But the thing about living in the moment is that it’s wrapped up in the weather, the mood I’m in, what I ate for lunch, how much sleep I’ve had, or how stressed I am about work obligations. Emotions are the fuel and the energy of our daily rhythms; they provide the movement of our lives. Created by God, our emotions are good and can teach us things about who we are, who our God is, and who our neighbor is; however, in and of themselves, our emotions are not trustworthy and ought not be left in charge to guide our lives. This is where worship can come into play.\n\nWorship can lasso the wild horses of shame, gladness, anger, loneliness, and sadness and then corral them inside the fence of truth. Worship is restorative; it is the corrective to our emotional ups and downs. It turns the disharmony of our circumstances into the resonant harmonies of a new song. Worship is not just about living in the moment; it is an honest look at who we are in light of who God is, of where we’ve been and where we are going. \n\nThrough worship and song, God invites us into a deeper relationship with Him. He reveals more of Himself through the act of worship, and as a result, our spirits, minds, and bodies are realigned to His reality—not what we perceive our circumstances to be through the lens of emotion. God provides and sustains in all things, and He teaches us to sing new songs of praise, new ways to worship Him within each new twist and turn of life, in times of both joy and sorrow.\n\nThere’s an old gospel hymn that says, “I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free.” But when we go through times of difficulty or transition that are disorientating, how do we keep worshiping? When awakened in the middle of the night with a newborn baby, or rising in the morning after a break-up, or standing on the grass at a loved one’s funeral, or in the slow delays of a long illness—how do we keep on singing?\n\nIt takes faith to believe in what we cannot see, to sing ourselves forward into hope. Worship is the practice of faith, of aligning our spirits with God’s kingdom reality; singing is what comes out on the other side. These words seem to spring up out of a deep well of gratitude within the psalmist, who says, “Hallelujah! How good it is to sing to our God” (Psalm 147:1).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Maria Furlough\n\nHave you ever wrestled with what it means to serve? In my own life, I’ve found it’s far easier to seek out what’s fun or brings comfort. Life gets tiring and stressful, and the only way we can survive is by putting something “fun” on the calendar, something to look forward to. Our family does this, and I don’t believe there is anything wrong with it. But I wonder if our craving for fun is masking a deeper desire for joy—the kind of fulfillment that comes from serving others.\n\nIn the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says that when He returns He will know who loves Him by the way that we help others: “For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink; I was a stranger and you took me in” (Matthew 25:35).\n\nWe’re tempted to read this verse and say to ourselves, “I need to sign up for a food kitchen” or “I need to give that homeless person a dollar the next time I see them.” These are all good things, sure, but is this the kind of service Jesus is really talking about in this passage?\n\nJesus also said, “For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve” (Mark 10:45). These two passages are bold calls to live our lives wide open to constant, regular, and sacrificial acts of laying our lives down for others. Jesus’s words beckon us to worship Him not through obligatory service, but with guttural prayers asking the Lord to allow us opportunities to love in His name. \n\nWhy does Jesus ask this of us? Jesus loves us, came to die for us, and knows that the only way for us to have the full, free, and joy-filled life that we so deeply desire is through the laying down our lives for others (John 15:13).\n\nWhat does this look like? It might look like embracing an interruption in our already busy day. Or perhaps it looks like bravely praying that God would send someone your way to love in His name. It might look like asking Him to reveal opportunities to worship Him through service to others. Maybe you’re called to embrace the uncomfortable and not shy away from that call because you are afraid of the unknown. \n\nWhen we create margin in our lives to serve others, we realize that any sacrifices we make to worship God in this way—whether it be through our time, resources, or creativity—all pale in comparison to the joy we receive as a result.\n\nI pray that today, God would show us ways we can serve as Jesus served, and that the joy that wells up when we do would create an unquenchable desire for more!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kimberly Girard\n\nIf we believe all of God’s Word is true, then we must receive even the hard things as being good for us. This means these words from the psalmist are true as well:\n\nThe precepts of the LORD are right, making the heart glad; the command of the LORD is radiant, making the eyes light up. –Psalm 19:8\n\nThe Lord’s commands are “radiant”—brilliant and beaming beacons of light in this world—and this verse tells us they are able to bring us joy. Those words are poetry, yes, but they are also true and applicable. So do we believe them in a practical sense? Do we experience joy from God’s commands? Do we feed and thrive on faithfulness and obedience to God as Daniel did?\n\nFor Daniel, there was no room for discussion about obedience. Even when he knew he’d be thrown into the lion’s den for worshiping the Lord, “three times a day he got down on his knees, prayed, and gave thanks to his God, just as he had done before” (Daniel 6:10). Obedience and worship were a way of life for Daniel, a posture of his heart and indicative of his relationship with God, not just a response to crisis. \n\nIn giving our lives in obedience to the Lord, in doing “everything in the name of the Lord Jesus” (Colossians 3:17), we ascribe worth to God, acknowledging that He alone is worthy of our worship, not only through our words but also through our actions. When we choose to live in accordance with God’s Word and His ways, we submit to His will and die to our own.\n\nLiving as an exile in Babylon most of his life, Daniel knew well that the earth was not his ultimate home, and he lived like it. He lived in obedience and continual service to his King, the Lord of heaven and of earth. Do we live like that? Do our lives look as radically obedient as Daniel’s life? Do the Lord’s commands bring light to our eyes or weight to our hearts? We know theoretically that God’s commands are for our good. But if we’re honest, we’re a wrecked, half-hearted people who worship so many other things with our lives.\n\nBut “the LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love” (Psalm 103:8); He does not leave us to ourselves. While we were still lost to our sin, Jesus Christ came to save us from ourselves, humbling “himself by becoming obedient to the point of death” (Romans 5:8; Philippians 2:7–8). Even now, He is sanctifying us into a people who will worship Him with our whole heart and whole lives in obedience to Him (2 Corinthians 3:18). The One who calls us to obedience gives us everything we need to obey Him (2 Peter 1:3).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nIn college, I was part of a university ministry that had been led in faithfulness by the same pastor for many years, and he still leads it to this day: a picture of steadfast commitment and fruit-bearing that can only come from a long obedience in the same direction (to borrow a book title from the late Eugene Peterson). \n\nThree years ago, we gathered with alumni and supporters to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of this faithful, beloved ministry. We took turns sharing memories and singing hymns, but the wind that blew through the whole evening was one of corporate gratitude: together, thanking God for His indescribable gift, we worshiped in song and story, in thanksgiving and praise. We thanked God for what He had done, and what we knew He would continue to do. \n\nEach of today’s passages from Scripture highlights corporate gratitude expressed in worship. In 1 Chronicles 16, David institutes the daily practice of thanksgiving, commissioning Asaph to lead the community in worship. David decrees his song of thanks in verses 8–36, which is then reflected in parts of Psalms 96, 105, and 106. \n\nThe structure of David’s song matches the content of Psalm 136 incredibly closely, and there’s a lot to be gleaned from what David thanks the Lord for and in what order.\n\nIn Psalm 136, we see the creation story unfold with a refrain about God’s everlasting love: He made the heavens, He spread the land on the water, He hung the sun and the moon and dotted the stars. Then we read, with the same call-and-response pattern, how He saved the Israelites from Egyptian slavery, struck down evil kings to protect His people, and gave them a homeland. The same themes leap off the page in 1 Chronicles 16, and they are cues we can take into our daily practice of worship and gratitude. \n\nIt’s interesting to me in that 1 Chronicles 16, David doesn’t specifically thank God for what had just happened: the bringing of the ark of the covenant into Jerusalem. They worshipped at the ark, where God dwelled, but their gratitude was cosmic in scale. It was not, “Thank You for what You did today, for this one specific thing we have to celebrate.” It was, and perhaps should usually be, “Thank You for who You have always been, for how You have loved Your people since the beginning of time.”\n\nIn corporate worship, in private prayer, in the smallest moments, and the most earth-shattering ones, we always have reason to thank God for what He has done and what we know He will do. Whether or not we feel grateful or not, whether or not we feel worshipful, there is always reason to worship in gratitude: because His faithful love endures forever. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Maria Furlough\n\nIn third grade I got called to the principal’s office for saying an inappropriate word. In my defense, someone had written it on the chair in front of me, and I was reading it aloud to my friend. As I made the trek from my classroom to the office, I remember my heart beating through my chest and tears running down my face. “Failure!” That’s what I heard over and over again in my mind, and I hated it. I never wanted to experience that feeling again—and a perfectionist started growing in me.\n\nWhen I met Jesus, my tendency toward perfectionism collided with my sinfulness, which then re-collided with the call on my life to be “holy” with my thoughts and actions. I don’t think I am alone in this struggle, and my prayer today is to break this whole “holiness” thing down and learn together how to worship God through it.\n\nLeviticus chapter 20 speaks to this call to holiness: “Consecrate yourselves and be holy, for I am the LORD your God” (v.7). In this passage, God warns His people to stay far away from cultural practices that are not of Him. God lays it out very simply: If what is going on around us is not of Him, then we need to stay away from it, to stand apart from what the world is doing—not simply because we have to, but because we want to, as an act of worship. We are called to live holy lives because we love God enough to trust that what He asks of us is for our good and His glory. \n\nIt seems simple, right? We worship God by standing apart. But how do we stand apart?\n\nWe find the answer in the next verse, which says, “Keep my statutes and do them” (Leviticus 20:8a). At the onset, we might get stuck on that fact that we can’t possibly keep all of His statutes on our own; we will always fall short and fail. Instead, we need to step into God’s infinite grace and mercy to see how He finishes the verse for us: “I am the LORD who sets you apart” (Leviticus 20:8b).\n\nIn these places of perfectionism and failure, I sense God whispering to me, “Sweet child, you worship me through holiness by coming to me over and over again and allowing Me to make you clean.” This is why Jesus came: to make us holy and bring us back into right relationship with God. He has chosen us to be His own and calls us holy now, today. Out of His great mercy, He called us out of the darkness of sin and into freedom in Him (1 Peter 2:9–10).\n\nWhat God asks of us is to do more than just hear and receive His word; we are to put our faith into action (James 1:22). He asks that we also pursue holiness and “rid [ourselves] of all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all slander” (1 Peter 2:1). In doing so, we “present [our] bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is [our] true act of worship” (Romans 12:1, emphasis mine).\n\nThis is our true act of worship: to submit ourselves daily to our loving God, and to consecrate every part of our lives to Him and His ways. We are to set our actions apart from the ways of this world, because He has chosen us and has already set us apart for Himself.\n\nEven this we cannot do this apart from the Holy Spirit in us. Let us then worship God freely, hands raised high and hearts wide open, knowing that both the holiness we possess and the holiness we pursue, He has made possible in us. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kimberly Girard\n\nLast night when I got into bed, I was completely wrecked by my sin—my selfishness in not loving my husband and children well, my discontentment, my quickness to anger, my quickness to speak out of anger… I could go on. And as I cried, I finally cried out to the Lord. I had been in the middle of writing this devotion on prayer, and yet turning to Him was not my first reaction. But the Lord, who sees and knows the depth of my sin much better than I do, met me and reminded me that He sees me in all my mess and loves me still. Indeed, there is great reward in prayer (Matthew 6:6).\n\nPrayer is coming to my Father as a needy child, acknowledging my inability to change situations or people or my own heart, and then acknowledging that God is mighty and that He reigns, ascribing worth to the Lord for who He is. \n\nIn Psalm 44, this kind of worship is modeled for us. Here, the psalmist is very real with his emotions. His plea is raw with vulnerability. He feels abandoned, yet he begins and ends the psalm in recognition of God’s faithful love for His people. Despite feeling rejected and forgotten, he comes back to what he knows to be true: God is faithful. \n\nThis is just one way prayer blesses, or “rewards,” us. When we turn to God in prayer, we are reminded of who He is and who we are not. There is relief in remembering that we are not the center of all things—not even our own lives. He is. And as He recenters us, He is able to do serious work in our hardened hearts as only He can, bringing peace when we feel fraught with anxiety.\n\nOf course, the ultimate reward of prayer is being in relationship with the Lord Himself. Prayer can be a form of worship because engaging in prayer reminds us that He is in our midst, in the details of our lives. “God is our refuge and strength, a helper who is always found in times of trouble” (Psalm 46:1). Regardless of our circumstances, He is sovereign. \n\n“The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love” (Psalm 103:8). God knows our desperate need of Him, even when we don’t acknowledge it ourselves. He says, “Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). His presence alone is the perfect balm to our weary souls.\n\nPrayer is an open invitation to relationship with God. It’s not always going to look pretty because we’re sinful, a broken and messy people. But Jesus’s blood covers all our sin—past, present, and future. He sees us in secret, knows the depths of our hearts, and loves us still.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nWhen I was seven or eight, I went to a Vacation Bible School with one of my friends. Her church was huge, much bigger than the one I attended every Sunday with my parents, and VBS was the biggest event of the summer. I remember being in awe throughout the morning session, which was complete with flashing lights, teenagers-turned-VBS-couselors performing skits on stage, and a David Crowder song based on part of the NIV translation of 2 Samuel 6:22: “I will become even more undignified than this.” The first few lyrics of the song are forever etched in my memory. I can still picture hundreds of kids jumping around the room singing: “I will dance, I will sing, to be mad for my King. / Nothing, Lord, is hindering this passion in my soul…” That’s the first time that I remember feeling like worship was a celebration. \n\nCelebration occurs all throughout Scripture—beautiful examples of people being reminded, and in turn, reminding one another, of who God is and what He has done. In Exodus 23, the Israelites are given specific instructions to celebrate throughout the year as a reminder of what God had done for them. And in Acts 2, we get a glimpse into how the early Church celebrated when they met together to praise God.\n\nIn 2 Samuel 6, we read about the all-out worship of King David before his God. He was “leaping and dancing before the LORD” (v.16), celebrating the arrival of the ark of the covenant in Jerusalem. However, his wife, Michal, thought his celebration was undignified and dishonoring. But David kept on celebrating, telling her, “I will dance before the LORD, and I will dishonor myself and humble myself even more” (vv.21–22). \n\nSince that morning at VBS, I’ve worshiped through celebration countless times. Any time we are gathered with other people to rejoice in what God has done or is doing in our lives, we worship and honor our God. Sometimes that takes the form of worship as we normally think of it, as singing, praying, and rejoicing, And sometimes, it can look a little different, like an outright, good ole celebration—birthday dinners and wedding receptions, baptisms and showers.\n\nIt’s important to remember that celebration can be a form of worship—a response to who God is and what He has done. And when we remember all that He has done for us, of course our response should be celebration! We have received grace upon grace in Christ, and that is worth celebrating.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nMy toes tend to curl when I hear the word “sacrifice.” My toes curl when I’m uncomfortable, when my anxiety spikes, or when I see something gross or gory flash across the television screen. It’s involuntary, like the knee-jerk reflex test at my annual physical. There’s some sort of connection in my brain between the word “sacrifice” and the feeling of danger and discomfort. \n\nI don’t think that’s necessarily a bad reaction, but one that gives me pause when I think about today’s readings. Even the notion of “worship as sacrifice” feels a little primitive, conjuring up images of priestly rites and clean animals and fires and blood. \n\nThe Old Testament sacrificial system depended on an exchange: the clean blood of an animal exchanged for a person’s uncleanness. Psalm 51 shows David’s prayer of repentance after his sin with Bathsheba. It is full of references to the sacrificial system but hints at the salvation to come: “You do not want a sacrifice, or I would give it; you are not pleased with a burnt offering” (v.16).\n\nWe no longer have to offer blood sacrifices to draw near to God; rather, Jesus has served as the sacrifice. Hebrews 10 gives us all the assurance of this blessed truth: “By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time” (v.10). \n\nRitual sacrifice is no longer required from us, but as we read today, sacrifice is presented as a form of worship. Throughout the New Testament, we see sacrifice exhorted and explained. It is part of our life of worship, our response to who God is and what He has done for us. \n\nThe beautiful story in Luke 7 shows a sinful woman offering her finest perfume to wash the feet of Jesus. Her sacrifice is monetary, but she also lays down whatever pride and fear she must have had. Given the scornful cynicism of the Pharisees who watched her, her actions must have cost her substantially more than an alabaster jar of fine perfume. \n\nIn Romans 12, Paul calls believers to sacrifice by living differently than the present age. “Do not be conformed to this age,” he writes (v.2). Reflecting on what it would truly mean for me to live differently than the world also makes my toes curl. \n\nHebrews 13 gives us two more examples of sacrifice: praise and good works. Philippians 4 commends financial offerings as sacrifice (v.18). And Mark 12 tells us that loving God and loving our neighbor are more valuable than burnt offerings (v.33).\n\nSacrifice looks like submission to God as He renews my heart, mind, words, service—my whole life—to better reflect His perfect character and boundless mercy. I am called to sacrifice my sinful nature, my active temptations, and my selfishness in an ongoing act of worship and praise to God, whose sacrifice alone makes me worthy to stand before Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nFor the record, I’m a pretty good driver. But give me an open stretch of highway heading west into a golden sunset or a dark country road lit by only a glowing harvest moon, and you’ll have reason to worry if you’re in my passenger seat. My focus shifts to the sky. Not only do I linger on the beauty, but I want whoever is riding with me to be deeply moved by it too. “Look at that sky!” I repeat, pointing and craning my neck to see more. “Do you see it?” I ask again, wanting to be sure that my passenger isn’t missing any of the glory. \n\nIn Reflections on the Psalms, C.S. Lewis said, “I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation.” Expressing awe and wonder deepens our appreciation, and we are better for it. As Lewis also said, praise is inner-health made audible.\n\nWe see this life-giving, out-loud pattern of worship throughout Scripture. It starts by recognizing the power and presence of God. Then, we proclaim His goodness to others. In turn, we experience deeper meaning and joy ourselves. \n\nWe see this in Deuteronomy when we read of Moses, ancient Israel’s prophet and deliverer, proclaiming the greatness of God to all the people. He says, “I will proclaim the LORD’s name. Declare the greatness of our God!” (Deuteronomy 32:3).\n\nWe hear it in the psalmist’s song of praise in times of both celebration and suffering. He proclaims, “I will bless the LORD at all times; his praise will always be on my lips” (Psalm 34:1).\n\nIt is good for praise to bubble up from our hearts and for celebration to spill out of our mouths as we proclaim God and His creative work all around us. But, there’s more. This pattern of proclamation deepens as we also give voice to how God has touched us personally. \n\nIn John 9, Jesus illustrates how God reveals Himself to the world through His personal touch by restoring sight to a man born blind. Neighbors wondered if the one with fresh eyes could really be the blind beggar they had passed on the street year after year. The Jewish leaders, fearing that Jesus was gaining reputation and power among the people, also cast suspicion on the miracle. They interrogated, insulted, and expelled the man from their community. But neither his neighbors’ skepticism nor the Jewish leaders’ intimidation would prevent the healed man from publicly declaring the works and ways of Jesus. He says, “One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I can see!” (v.25). This man had been given new vision and a new story. \n\nThis is the pattern of proclamation: I recognize that I was once blind, but now I have seen and experienced God’s personal touch and restoration in my life. This causes me to humbly and boldly proclaim His goodness to others, and my joy and wonder deepen as I share my story. \n\nSo, lean out the window and look again. God is at work all around us and even inside our own lives. Nudge the person next to you and crane your neck to see more. Look at what God is doing! Do you see it? Share the vision, and proclaim the story. We don’t want anyone to miss His glory! \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nIn any study of biblical people, it’s tempting to take the easy route and look at the humans in the story and say, “Yeah! Do what they did!” or, more frequently, “Don’t do what she did, oh no!” We long to take a moral from the stories of their lives. Resist this urge. Look instead, in every story, at what God is doing. Even in the stories where we don’t see His name mentioned, He is working and remembering His people. He is putting the gospel story on display in their individual stories—and in our own.\n\nAdam and Eve give us a glimpse of what pre-fall humanity looked like as untarnished image-bearers of God (Genesis 1:27). At the start, they are righteously naked—naked like babies. I imagine they are just delighted to be alive, living freely in healthy, functioning bodies alongside their Creator. But after the fall, Adam and Eve are tarnished image-bearers of God, and their nakedness bears shame instead of pure and innocent glory.\n\nTruly, Adam and Eve’s original state is hardly recognizable to us. Since the fall, we now see all things from the perspective of our own fallenness. Every nook and cranny of our world now hides a tinge of that original sin. So it’s tough to imagine righteous nakedness, but I am definitely on board for the new heaven and the new earth where shame and sin no longer smudge the image of God we bear.\n\nAdam and Eve, realizing their sin and shame, attempt to hide and cover up. First they use their own hands to craft garments from fig leaves; they are attempting a man-made, physical solution to a spiritual problem. This is insufficient.\n\nThen God clothes them in animal skins, but this requires the first shedding of blood—the loss of life and spirit of an animal—signifying that a God-created, spiritual solution is needed to solve the problem of sin and shame.\n\nWe need God to clothe us as He clothed Adam and Eve. Our spotless righteousness was lost in the fall. Now, we must be clothed with His robes of righteousness, which can only be granted by the shedding of blood—Jesus’s blood. When we are clothed in His righteousness, we can once again find freedom from shame and guilt.\n\nWe still try to find our own way to righteousness, to free ourselves from shame, either by declaring our sins to be virtues—or by ignoring them altogether. We try to deny that we are fallen at all and laud our shame as admirable (Romans 1:28–32). But these efforts are just more fig leaves.\n\nThe only solution is Christ. He does not return us to the past, to Eden, but raises us to a new and greater Eden, which cannot be lost. He does not merely restore us to pre-fallen righteous nakedness, but grants us the new and more glorious clothing of Christ’s righteousness. In Him alone we find the fullness of what it means to be made in the image of God: to be like Christ. And “we know that we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is” (1 John 3:2).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nMy husband and I swore we would never plant a church.\n\nWe didn’t have the personalities for it. We didn’t have the risk tolerance. We didn’t have the entrepreneurial skill set it demanded. And besides, we had seen other people start churches and knew how hard it was. We believed in church planting, but it was for “other people,” we said.\n\nAnd then, God called us to plant a church. \n\nFor months we resisted. We considered other options. We interviewed for other jobs. We asked God to confirm His calling while secretly hoping He would not. This was not the story we had chosen for ourselves. \n\nRadical obedience to God makes for great Sunday school lessons and bedtime stories, and Noah’s Ark is one of the most beloved. A man called by God, so late in his life, to do something remarkably ludicrous by the world’s standards: to build an ark on dry ground, large enough to hold animals of every kind. It is a fun story to tell, but the reality of radical obedience is a different matter. It is scary. It is uncomfortable. It is risky. And sometimes, it is embarrassing.\n\nWe can only imagine how Noah might have felt throughout the construction of the ark. What was the reaction of the surrounding community? Did they question his state of mind?\n\nAs often as we tell this story to our children, as often as we reenact the animals marching two by two, and as often as we remember the importance of trusting God’s character, we sometimes miss the utter foolishness of Noah’s faithfulness. In Noah’s story and many others’ throughout Scripture, it is impossible to obey and maintain one’s dignified reputation. They have to choose. As do we.\n\nThis is the less talked about side of following God. Yes, it is hard. Yes, we sacrifice. Yes, it is painful. But the part of faithfulness that sometimes catches us by surprise is the humiliation of it. The whispers. The stares. The questions about your motives. The doubts about your leadership. The absence of support. The silence. The skepticism about whether or not you really heard from God.\n\nWe cannot miss this part of Noah’s story—his willingness to look like a fool—because this is, very often, what we are saying yes to when we say yes to God. Thankfully, we have historical figures like Noah to remind us who God is and why we can trust Him. And more importantly, we also have Christ, who obediently became a fool, endured mockery, and suffered total humiliation because He knew the end of the story. This so-called foolishness is the narrow path we are called to, but because of spiritual ancestors like Noah, and because of Christ Himself, we know that no matter what God calls us to—whether we would have chosen it or not—we are never doing it alone. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nWhen the New Testament talks about the great patriarch Abraham, it’s his tremendous faith that is the highlight of his story. He was indeed exceptional, but Abraham wasn’t perfect. Throughout the course of his story, we see that while Abraham clearly believed God’s promise, he didn’t always trust God’s process. \n\n(A part of Abraham’s story is God changing his name, from Abram to Abraham. More on that in a moment. But let’s begin earlier in his journey, before God changed his name.)\n\nWhen God promised Abram that he would be the father of a son who would be the beginning of a mighty nation, Abram believed God and it was “credited to him as righteousness” (Genesis 15:6). But his faith didn’t keep him taking from matters into his own hands. He had a son, but not by his wife Sarai. She had been unable to conceive, so, at Sarai’s prompting, Abram slept with Sarai’s servant Hagar. Ishmael was born, but he was not the son of promise. \n\nAbram and his wife took the promise God had made to them and tried to bring it about on their own terms. In a sense, it was the fall all over again (Genesis 3). It wasn’t Abram’s finest moment, but it’s not the end of his story. After his failure, God didn’t abandon His promise to Abram. God had another, better plan. God’s plan was an invitation to stretch Abram’s faith.\n\nGod called Abram to a life cut off from his old practices and patterns. This would be symbolized in two ways. First, God changed his name from Abram to Abraham. Second, God instructed Abraham to be circumcised. Circumcision showed Abraham’s trust was in the Lord, not in his own flesh, to put it delicately.\n\nThis call to obedience was followed by an unbelievable promise. God would demonstrate His faithfulness to Abraham by giving he and his wife Sarah a son; they would name him Isaac. \n\nThe Bible tells us he went that very day to circumcise himself and the men of his household. \n\nCan I ask you to think about the faith it took for Abraham to honor God in circumcision when God’s promise of Isaac depended on that very part of his anatomy? Not to be crass, but the circumstances of his circumcision couldn’t have been exactly clinical, and the recovery was likely difficult. And yet, in less than a year, Abraham would be holding the reality of God’s promise in his arms.\n\nAbraham had to completely trust God for the blessing of his son Isaac. His story reminds us that God’s greatest promises often invite the greatest faith. God hadn’t just given Abraham a son, God had strengthened Abraham’s faith. \n\nOur faith must win out over our fear. Fear will cause us to fret, scheme, and take control. Fear will convince us that we can and should take matters into our own hands. Abraham’s story proves that God’s plans won’t always be accomplished in the ways we might imagine. Our faith isn’t built merely on the promises of God, but on the character of the God who makes those promises. We live in confidence that He will fulfill them in His time and in His ways.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI have a very little baby right now. I spend most of my hours nursing her or holding her. And when she finally happens to be sleeping somewhere that’s not my arms I’m able to do other things. But the problem is my list of “necessaries” has become so long and so urgent that I can’t even decide where to begin. I lay the baby down and just stand still with glazed-over eyes, thinking, Where do I begin? This morning while she napped, I gaped at my list with sheer, uncomprehending panic. I couldn’t set myself on a course. And if you can’t find a place to start, and then stick with your plan, nothing ever gets done. I spend the moments in between nursing sessions drifting from task to task. Homeschooling, housecleaning, writing, trying to be present and available. But these responsibilities stack on top of each other, and I inevitably find my mind aimlessly wandering.\n\nEven the most focused among us are prone to wander. We allow ourselves little, innocent wanderings (like idly wondering if hummingbirds fly to Puerto Rico in the winter) or wide, damaging veers off the course (like refusing to forgive). And sometimes we flat-out run away. That’s what Hagar did. Sarai, later renamed Sarah, treated her maidservant harshly, and pregnant Hagar ran from her, into the wilderness. But the Lord saw her. He gives grace to those who can’t seem to take anymore.\n\nDo you find yourself in her shoes sometimes? Not, ahem, the impregnated maidservant of a biblical patriarch so much, but by yourself in the wilderness? Those who stray, those who run, are nevertheless beloved by Him. He still attended and cared for Hagar in the desert, and He does the same for us.\n\nGod sees us even when we can no longer see straight. His providence encompasses us no matter where we go. This is not a reason to excuse and condone waywardness, but it’s a reminder of the goodness and graciousness of God, a provocation to gratefulness and an exhortation to run to Him.\n\nHe didn’t see Hagar because of anything she’d done. We aren’t told she had faith like Abraham’s. We read nothing about her devotion to God or to righteousness. As Sarai’s maidservant, she didn’t have much of a choice in the matter when it came to bearing Ishmael. And when Sarai was mean to her, she ran off in disobedience. Of course, we can all empathize with her, but the fact of the matter is, God saw Hagar and comforted her in the desert because He is good, not because Hagar was. And that is good news for all who wander. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nMy backyard garden is an unrealized dream. A few months ago we sowed and scattered seeds with the haphazard helping hands of my four-year-old daughter. Despite multiple warnings not to do so, she dumped an entire container of bird seed alongside my hoped-for flowers. In addition, the sod we ripped up to make room for the garden left rows of roots that like to pop up, and no matter how many times I rip them out, they always seem to show up again. \n\nNow I cannot tell weeds from future blooms, and the hours I spent trying to cultivate a beautiful cut-flower garden seem fruitless (or, flowerless). I know that eventually, the real flowers will bloom, and then I can root out the weeds that have grown. \n\nSarah’s life was marked by a root of bitterness, a weed that made her scoff at God’s promise and treat Hagar with contempt and cruelty. Bitterness was born out of her perceived injustice: her husband fathering a son with her slave (Genesis 21:9–10), her own inability to have children (11:30), and the seemingly-impossible promise God made to her (18:10). \n\nIf you told me today that in two months, my garden would be bursting with zinnias, peonies, snapdragons, and gardenias, I would probably laugh. My track record, like Sarah’s in childbearing, is sparse. I have nothing on which to base my hope of a bountiful flower harvest. \n\nWhat did Sarah have to fight back against her bitterness? She had a promise, a word spoken by the Author of promises. But still, she laughed. \n\nThankfully, the fulfillment of God’s promise to Sarah did not rest on her. God did not bless her with a son, Isaac, because of her attitude. It was not a reward based on piety, or character, or anything other than His word. And His word is always good, no matter the shape and bent of our hearts. \n\nBitterness has deep roots in my own heart, and daily I have to push against its influence. I think, You deserve this. You’ve earned it. And then I compare my circumstances to someone else’s, reasoning, What has she done to get that thing (job, house, vacation, experience, complexion)? I am just as worthy!\n\nThe problem with this false narrative is this: not only is it deeply baked in privilege, but it feeds into the merit-based culture we live in. Entitlement begets merit, which begets more entitlement, and so on. The culture of God’s kingdom is anchored neither in merit nor in entitlement, but rather in the goodness and faithfulness of God. \n\nSarah had neither merit nor entitlement. She seemed to have bitterness where faithfulness should grow. But what she did have was the promise, and so she became the mother of the promise by God’s grace alone. \n\nOn bitterness, poet and hymn writer Anne Ross Cousin said this in her poem, “In Immanuel’s Land”:\n\nSoon shall the cup of glory Wash down earth’s bitterest woes, Soon shall the desert briar, Break in to Eden’s rose  …  I stand upon His merit,  I know no other stand Not e’en where glory dwelleth In Immanuel’s land. \n\nThe things I long for are chaff and weeds, distractions from the best promise ever made: the eternal presence of the Lord Himself. Like Sarah, I have no merit to cling to as I wait for the fulfillment of God’s promises. But I have Him, and His Word, and His merit alone. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nAny woman who has held a chubby-faced cherub in her arms surely gets squeamish at the idea of surrendering a child. Though it knots up our stomachs, the pattern of parents surrendering children to the Lord is inescapably woven throughout the Bible. \n\nWe see it with Moses’s mama as she tenderly laid him in a basket and placed him in the river (Exodus 2:1–10). Perhaps we remember our own bins of baby clothes stashed in the closet as we read about Samuel, whose mother, Hannah, gave up her toddler to serve in the temple, and then faithfully delivered a “little robe” to him each year (1 Samuel 1:1–2:21). And as we consider the life of Isaac, the promised miracle child of Abraham, we see this surrender in graphic detail. \n\nIf this is just a human story about a human family, frankly, it stinks. How could a good God ask a father to give up the child of promise he was given? How could a good father agree to such a request? It is hard to wrap our hearts around the situation. But this is more than a story about one human family. This account of Abraham and Isaac points to the bigger story. Way back in Genesis, God was showing His people a preview of the gospel. If we anxiously look away from this story or race through it to find an easier pill to swallow, we will miss the stunning parallels. \n\nIsaac carried the wood for the sacrifice on his back (Genesis 22:6).Jesus carried the cross on His back, on the way to Golgotha (John 19:17). \n\nIsaac was bound and led to the altar (Genesis 22:9).Christ was bound and led to the cross (Mark 15:1). \n\nIsaac is described as Abraham and Sarah’s beloved and “only son” (Genesis 22:2). Centuries later, God the Father would declare from heaven, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased” (Matthew 3:17). \n\nBecause of Abraham’s obedience, the angel of the Lord promised, “All the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring because you have obeyed my command” (Genesis 22:18).Because of Christ’s obedience, “[He] purchased people for God by [His] blood from every tribe and language and people and nation” (Revelation 5:9).\n\nBut these stories diverge at a critical juncture. Isaac’s life was ultimately spared (Genesis 22:11–14), but for Christ there would be no ram in the thicket. The Father would follow through with the sacrifice so that all sons and daughters could be spared. \n\nWe will all have “Isaacs” to lay down on the altar. But our stories are no more about us than Isaac’s moment on the mountain was about him. Our lives are stamped by the gospel. Every baby in the bullrushes, every “tiny robe,” every day we choose to hold our own beloveds with open palms—we are reminded that our God willingly sacrificed His beloved Son so that we might be called the children of God (John 1:12). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kimberly Girard\n\nThree years ago, we told our kids we were moving to a new city. Through tears, we told them we were choosing to follow where we believed God was leading us. My husband said he believed God would be kind to each one of us in this move because He “is good, and his faithful love endures forever; his faithfulness, through all generations” (Psalm 100:5, emphasis mine).\n\nGranted, God’s goodness didn’t always look the way we expected it to, but over these past three years, our family has experientially learned over and over again that God is indeed good and that He doesn’t stop being faithful to His people. And we see that same faithful God in Rebekah’s story.\n\nRebekah is going about the daily work the Lord has set before her when she’s asked to leave everything familiar behind and follow God into the unknown. Not only is she asked to move to a new land, but she’s also asked to marry a man she’s never seen. And she goes willingly! \n\nWhen Abraham’s servant tells Rebekah’s family this remarkable story of God’s leading, Rebekah’s father and brother declare, “This is from the Lord; we have no choice in the matter. Rebekah is here in front of you. Take her and go, and let her be a wife for your master’s son, just as the Lord has spoken” (Genesis 24:50–51).\n\nIt’s clear to Rebekah’s family and to Abraham’s servant that “a person’s steps are established by the Lord” (Psalm 37:23). They see that the Lord has appointed Rebekah for Isaac. \n\nWhile we see the faithfulness of both Rebekah and her family in how they follow God, this is also the story of a much deeper faithfulness—God’s faithfulness to His people. Rebekah’s story, my story, and all the stories of God’s children are ultimately stories of God’s unending commitment to His people. Even in the deeply painful places, God is faithful. His faithfulness is found all over this story and throughout our own lives as well. And as we see with Abraham’s servant, when we share the stories of God’s faithfulness, they lead us to worship.\n\nYou don’t have to read much further to find that Rebekah is sinful just like us. But the good news of the gospel is that God’s faithfulness isn’t contingent upon our own. “While we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). The Bible is the story of God’s faithfulness to an unfaithful people He never stops pursuing.\n\nHowever huge and daunting the unfamiliar—or even the familiar—seems today, we can trust God because He is faithful, as He was in the past and will be forever. “His mercies never end. They are new every morning; great is [His] faithfulness!” (Lamentations 3:22–23).\n\n",

(And if you do, you are my kind of people and can pass “Go” to collect $200.) \n\nWhile I’ve always had infinite admiration for Vanna White on Wheel of Fortune, and my brother claimed he bonded best with our father over Family Feud, it was a blonde British woman named Anne Robinson who really raised the bar for game shows. Host of The Weakest Link, (which came aired at 4 pm, just in time for my elementary-school self to hop off the school bus and grab a cheese stick), Anne was known for her no-nonsense TV personality, and I adored her for it. \n\nOn the show, a team of contestants would take turns answering trivia questions with the goal of getting the most correct answers within a specific amount of time. When time was up, the team voted on the weakest link (a.k.a., the worst player in the game). Then it was time for the most memorable part of the show, when Anne would announce the loser by addressing the individual by name and proclaiming, “You are the weakest link. Goodbye.”\n\nIt’s easy to treat the story of Jacob and Esau like another episode of The Weakest Link. Which brother is doing the right thing? Who deserves favoritism? Who does God love more? \n\nFirst, we have Esau, who sells his birthright to Jacob for stew. Then, we have Jacob, who steals the blessing that was rightfully Esau’s. If I were the judge, I’d conclude that they were both at fault. They’re both weak links. \n\nEsau’s story is much like ours; he gave in to his fleshly desires and lost the most valuable thing in his possession. But he was also hurt and wronged by his own flesh and blood, his brother Jacob. It’s the oldest and truest story we know: Our flesh chose sin, and our hearts chose betrayal. Pain is a constant in our stories. We are the weakest links. And yet, God didn’t say goodbye to us in our weakness—far from it, actually. He did the exact opposite: He sent His Son to reverse the curse by bearing the weight of our sin, a burden that had rightfully been placed on us. \n\nThese stories in Genesis, set just after creation story and the Fall, and long before the birth of our Savior, show us how deeply we need redemption. We cannot be trusted with things of value like birthrights, brothers, or blessings. An intervention is necessary, and thanks be to God, an intervention is coming. But first, we must take this opportunity to realize our humanity, grieve our sin, and repent. We cannot proclaim His strength without first admitting our weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9). \n\n“And make sure that there isn’t any immoral or irreverent person like Esau, who sold his birthright in exchange for a single meal. For you know that later, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, even though he sought it with tears, because he didn’t find any opportunity for repentance” (Hebrews 12:16–17).\n\nAny average ruler (or game show, for that matter) would certainly have chosen for Esau, Jacob, you, and I to pack up our bags a very long time ago, at the onset of our failures. But because of Christ’s sacrifice, we are welcomed into eternity instead of turned away. What a prize indeed. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nWhatever my four-year-old niece is doing, she wants my sister, her mom, to be watching.\n\n“Look, Mommy!”\n\n“Look at this, Mommy!”\n\n“Look over here, Mommy!”\n\nIt’s as if whatever ball she is throwing, twirl she is doing, or somersault she is attempting doesn’t count unless her mom sees her. \n\nThis desire to be seen is innate in us all, and it doesn’t disappear with childhood. As we read today, a full-grown woman can ache with longing when she knows she is not seen.\n\nLeah is unloved and unwanted. Jacob loved her sister, Rachel, more than her. Rachel is described as “shapely and beautiful.” Leah is described as ordinary. Oh, could this story hit more close to home? Who hasn’t felt less than, like not enough in comparison to the women around you?\n\nThis story gives me flashbacks to my tall, gangly adolescent self. I knew I was neither shapely nor beautiful. I watched both of my sisters—inside and out, the most beautiful women I know—be crowned Homecoming Queen and Prom Queen and I wondered, does anyone see me? If I am not wearing a crown, am I still worth something? In high school, it’s hard to believe that you are.\n\nLeah is aware that God sees her: “The LORD has seen my affliction,” she says (Genesis 29:32). “The LORD heard that I am unloved” (v.33). But her response to God’s attention is to then desire the attention of Jacob. As she says after she bears three sons, “Surely my husband will love me now… At last my husband will become attached to me” (vv.32,34).\n\nI wonder if we are all born with an innate desire to be seen because we already are. But instead of resting in God’s attention and care, we crave the attention of others. We want the crown, the sons, the stamp of approval that will make us feel loved and seen by everyone but God.\n\nInterestingly, our story does not end with Jacob giving Leah his stamp of approval. Instead, after the birth of her last son, Judah, it is a different stamp of approval that Leah desires: “This time I will praise the Lord” (v.35). No craving for Jacob’s love. No hoping for his attachment. Her attention is now on the One who’s always paid attention to her, the One who’s loved her all along.\n\nJudah would eventually be Israel’s greatest tribe. Jesus’s bloodline would point back to Judah by name, while the others are referred to as “his brothers” (Matthew 1:2). Leah and her plight would be memorialized forever in history. But she knew none of this when she praised the Lord. \n\nWhat is the reason you feel unseen? Whose attention do you crave? Do you believe you are heard by God, seen by God? If so, this time, this day, instead of longing for the gaze of that person, or those people, rest in the gaze that is already on you. You don’t have to beg Him to “Look!” He is already looking. This time, praise the Lord.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nLaban really gave his daughters a raw deal. When he tricked Jacob into marrying Leah, he sentenced both of his girls to one truly heartbreaking marriage. Instead of enjoying sweet accord between husband and wife, both women are crowded into a bitter, vengeful squeeze of marital misery. One wife is just the right number of wives, but one man, two sisters, and their maidservants to boot is a cramped relationship for sure. Indeed, the normal strains of marriage are quite enough without having to engage in a fertility contest with your own sister. A fertility contest that Rachel was losing—the stats were 10 to 0 against Rachel before Joseph was finally born.\n\nOnce a month, my husband goes out for an evening with his friends to discuss literature. But by the time he gets home at 10pm I’ve had quite enough of sharing him with others. Marriage is a tight circle of two. Rachel and Leah were both denied the sweet intimacy that can only exist when two people are alone in a marriage. They likely both felt forgotten by both their husband and by God. And forgotten is a feeling that we can all identify with. People will absolutely forget us. Terrible marriages, absent parents, distracted friends, and even children can pass over us as they forge ahead in life.\n\nBut there is One who does not forget. God remembers His people. God remembered Rachel (Genesis 20:22). And in Scripture, when it says that God “remembers” someone, it means that He is going to intervene and help. When God remembers, He takes action (Genesis 9:15, 19:29, 30:22; Exodus 2:24, 32:13; Psalms 25:6–7, 74:2). Even though Rachel seems to only be asking Jacob for help, God remembers Rachel. He remembers, He listens, and He opens her womb (Genesis 30:1,22).\n\nIn the weirdest and most uncomfortable situations—in the deepest, saddest days—God remembers and listens. It goes without saying that His action may not be what we are asking for or what we think the situation requires, but in His sovereignty, He listens and remembers His people.\n\nRachel died in childbirth when Benjamin was born. She fought with Leah for her entire married life, and she never got to enjoy watching her own sons grow up. She didn’t get to grow old with the man she loved. It was Leah’s son, Judah, who was in the line of Christ. Rachel’s life probably did not turn out at all like she had hoped. But she was remembered by God.\n\nLife isn’t about us and what we are doing. It is easy to forget that just because things have not gone as we hoped, that does not mean that we are forgotten or abandoned. Indeed, God builds His kingdom even amidst our dashed expectations.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nGrowing up in Northern California, I spent summers along the south fork of the American River in the tiny, blink-your-eyes-and-it’s-gone town of Coloma, the heart of the gold rush valley. Summers there were sticky. Tourists from every pocket of the world came for the whitewater and left baptized by sunshine, sunscreen, and coconut frozen yogurt from the shop down the street.\n\nAlong the river, you can spot towers of smooth stones called cairns balanced one or two feet high. Although these are now little more than artistic contributions from local river folk, in ancient times, cairns served as burial monuments or ceremonial landmarks. They marked something worth remembering. \n\nThroughout Scripture, stones symbolize many different things. After Jacob’s dream, where God promises to watch over and provide for him, he is caught off guard and uses the stone lying at his head to memorialize the moment: “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it” (Genesis 28:16). Suddenly, that place was known as Bethel, the house of God, because the Lord had made His presence known there (v.19). \n\nI love that Jacob was surprised by encountering God. Aren’t we always forgetting how close He is? Embedded in us is the classic tension between head and heart: we know God is with us, though sometimes it may not feel like He is. I can’t tell you often I’ve been surprised to find Him, just when I’d feared that His silence indicated His absence.\n\nThis stone was an important step in Jacob’s journey. Because of what the Lord revealed to him in a dream, he was able to carry forward the promise of returning to his “native land” with confidence (Genesis 31:13). But I admit, I’m a little confused by the plot twist. \n\nBefore Jacob makes it home, he meets and wrestles with God. Why was this the method for receiving God’s blessing? Why couldn’t Jacob have his homecoming without a disjointed hip? Despite the paradox of blessing brought from misfortune, Jacob is so moved by encountering God’s presence that he, once again, names the place to memorialize it. \n\nWhether it’s owning a home or publishing a book or witnessing a reconciliation, my heart desires things that aren’t guaranteed. What God does promise is abundant life: new ways of thinking, of living, of being. We are no longer slaves to death. We don’t have to wait for God to inhabit a place now that His Spirit lives in us. \n\nAs we watch for the Lord together, let’s name the moment we see Him. Let’s raise a stone in remembrance. Let’s live from a place of blessing and abundance rather than scarcity, because our birthrights are no longer dependent upon our earthly lineage. Instead, we hold the heavenly birthright Christ gives us, “an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading” (1 Peter 1:4).\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nSibling relationships are tough. For the entirety of my childhood, I skittered around my older sisters’ bedrooms, pilfering makeup, borrowing clothes, and denying that I’d done anything of the sort. We tattled on each other constantly. And when one of my sisters finally got her driver’s license, she was annoyed to discover that meant she would have to drive me to school every day. I wanted my sisters to like me, and yet try as I might, I was always a little bit annoying.\n\nJoseph was a little annoying too. Scripture tells us he had a habit of tattling on his brothers (Genesis 37:2). And later, when he had vivid dreams of his future glory, he didn’t tuck those dreams away to contemplate in private. Instead, he went on blabbing them to everyone! Even his father got a little tired of 17-year-old Joseph’s big head (v.10).\n\nJoseph’s story is the very last story in Genesis. It’s a hard story, one of sibling rivalry and deceit and near-murder. After all, when his brothers sold him into slavery, they had no idea how Joseph would fare in the hands of his captors. Would he survive? Did they care?\n\nThough today’s assigned Scripture gives the bookended view of Joseph’s story, it’s worth taking time to read what happened in between. In the years after his brothers sold Joseph into slavery, he was sold again, accused of rape, and then thrown into prison, where he festered for more than two years. When Pharaoh finally summoned Joseph from the dungeon to interpret his terrifying dreams (Genesis 41), Joseph’s own dreams could have easily faded into nothing in his memory. Where was the God who had promised to give him power and influence? \n\nThe truth is, Joseph’s life was far worse and far better than what he’d seen in those dreams. God had a plan for him, but that plan included much suffering. That plan included brothers that plotted evil against him. It included time in a dungeon. It included trembling before a king that could have killed him on sight. And it included rising to a position of power that ultimately saved his entire family—and the region—from starvation. What they planned for evil, God used for good (Genesis 50:20). \n\nBecause we have the rest of Scripture, we know that Joseph’s role in the redemption of the world was only the beginning. After all, that large family that arrived in Egypt to escape starvation ultimately became the nation of slaves at the beginning of Exodus—the ones crying out for a savior. There was more suffering to come. And more saving.\n\nJoseph’s life was central to God’s plan for the world. But just because we’re living out God’s plan for our life doesn’t mean there won’t be pain. We can rest assured that even what others plan for evil, God can use for good.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Potiphar’s Wife",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nOne of the hardest and most helpless feelings in the world is when another person deals carelessly with our reputations. Maybe it is an anonymous person online who publicly questions our motives. Maybe it is a commenter who glimpses one photo of our lives and makes assumptions about our parenting. Maybe it is a friend who is angry with us and then vents to our mutual friends. Maybe it is an ex-boyfriend, or an ex-husband, who is sharing a very different version of the break-up than the one we know to be true.\n\nWhenever we experience slander, unfair criticism, or unfounded accusations, it can feel as though our hard-earned reputations are being dismantled brick by brick. Everything we worked for, the integrity we established over the course of years, suddenly seems fragile and vulnerable, all because of the untested words of a gossiper.\n\nJoseph knew this helplessness well. He was a humble man of exceptional character, who spent his life climbing out of a pit, working his way up, making connections, and earning a good name, only to have it all undone by the wicked whim of a powerful woman. At least, that is how it must have seemed at the time. But that is not how Joseph’s story ended. In actuality, what determined the outcome of Joseph’s story was not power, but character.\n\nAs we now know, Joseph’s life did not end with this accusation. It seems that almost immediately, Potiphar distrusts his wife’s account. We know this because the punishment for Joseph’s supposed crime should be death, but instead, Potiphar only imprisons him. He is, in essence, not giving Joseph what he deserves. What this tells us is that Joseph’s character is influencing the outcome, and it would continue to do so for years.\n\nIn the chapters that follow, Joseph’s character opens doors for him. He gains favor with those in authority over him, until he eventually receives authority himself. Joseph is forever remembered as a noble man and a great leader; Potiphar’s wife, on the other hand, is only remembered for one of the worst decisions of her life. We don’t even know her name.\n\nIt is difficult to be on the receiving end of slander or a false accusation, but this story comforts us with this truth: your character is louder than you think. Character always reveals who you really are, and no amount of power, lies, or manipulation can hide it. This is a comfort for those of us who choose the way of holiness, but it is also a warning for when we don’t. \n\nThe sin of Potiphar’s wife was not simply lust, but the abuse of power, and none of us is immune to it. Our need for control—even when it is directed toward good and noble purposes—can lead us to compromise our integrity. “The ends justify the means,” we reason. But this is not the logic of godly character. Instead, we follow a Savior who chose to be falsely accused rather than exert His will by force. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nObedience always brings blessings. I’ve heard that message preached, but Exodus 1 seems to teach us something different. It reminds us that we must be very careful with what we expect for our obedience and what we define as a blessing. Today’s reading commends a faith that reverently fears God, not the opinions, whims, and wants of men.\n\nFearing the growth and potential power of the Hebrew slave nation, Pharaoh orders the midwives who assisted the Hebrew women in childbirth to kill all the boys they helped to deliver. The Bible records the names of these women: Shiphrah and Puah. Pharaoh commands them to be His co-conspirators in a plot to decimate the Hebrew population. But they never carry out Pharaoh’s plan. It is a bold, faith-filled move. But the results are a mixed bag of blessings. We can learn a few important lessons from their example.\n\nWe must be careful not to assume that our obedience clears the path to ease and happiness. The midwives feared God more than they feared Pharaoh. But their act of rebellion, though honorable, moved Pharaoh to ratchet up his plan against Israel, and he commanded that all baby boys be thrown into the Nile. This is why we must be careful not to barter our obedience for God’s blessings. Our blessing may be things we cannot see.\n\nIn the case of the midwives, they were rewarded with tangible gifts. The Bible records that God blessed the women with families of their own. There is no formula that says our obedience will unlock the desires of our hearts. However, God is the Giver of every good thing we receive (James 1:17).\n\nIt’s not entirely clear if the midwives were Hebrew or Egyptian. Either way their faith was tested. Yes, God blessed the midwives with families of their own, but the very next verse says that Pharaoh now commanded that all Hebrew boys be thrown in the Nile. Would the faithful midwives now lose their own children to Pharaoh’s evil mandate? Or were the midwives Egyptian women who would watch helplessly as even more baby boys were killed? God saw their faithfulness and would now grow their faith even more. \n\nOur greatest blessings and most precious rewards are the eternal ones. I want God to make me bolder, refine my character, and chisel away my selfishness. Those treasures won’t always feel like blessings. \n\nThe overwhelming context of Scripture points to these same truths. Obedience doesn’t guarantee or broker blessings. Obedience must be motivated by faith in God, not the fear of man. Like Shiphrah and Puah, we are commended to act in ways that prove our confidence in our God who is always faithful, keeps His word, and blesses His people. I’d like to be the kind of person who trusts God to give and define my blessings. I’d rather be changed for eternity than comforted temporarily.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nMoses is a hero of our faith. His life is the stuff of legends—found as a baby in the Nile, talking to a burning bush, heralding plagues in Egypt, parting the Red Sea. Who can claim a life as epic as the one Moses got to lead? And what made the difference? What made this man so dramatically different from everyone else?\n\nWe are inclined to picture Moses with the face of Charlton Heston—square-jawed, steely-eyed, and full of manly courage. But his first, second, and third responses to God’s call were fear and squirming. He eventually answered the call, but courage certainly wasn’t what made him stand apart. Moses even doubted God’s ability to work through him. In his self-doubt and excuse-making, we see how afraid Moses was, running from the serpent, and trying to wiggle out of his holy calling.\n\nHere is what makes all the difference: God’s promised presence. He said to Moses, “I will certainly be with you” (Exodus 3:12). Moses was great because he stood on holy ground (vv.5–6). He stood on the foundation of God’s faithfulness. Every word from his mouth, or from the mouth of Aaron, was powerful because they were God’s words. The staff in his hands was the tool of God’s work of deliverance. Again and again, the assurance that God gave to trembling Moses was that He, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, would be the true deliverer of Israel.\n\nWhen Israel rejected Moses’s leadership, they were truly rejecting God; Moses was simply the minister of God’s will and word to His people. In this we see two great truths that apply directly to us today. First, God Himself is the true deliverer. We do not lead others out of bondage. Only Christ does. We do not save.. Only the hand of God does.\n\nSecond, our own calling, like that of Moses, is to be willing instruments in the hands of God. It does not matter how feeble our voices, how weak our knees, how trembling our hearts. God’s power is made perfect in our weakness. The greatest deeds of our lives will be those in which we are malleable to His will, and in which He receives all the glory. He must increase, and we must decrease.\n\nGod graciously invites fearful and inarticulate servants like us to join in His great work in the world. There was nothing extraordinarily special about Moses, except that He was chosen by God to stand on holy ground. And thanks be to God, that the true work of deliverance is already accomplished fully by His own Son Jesus Christ!\n\n",

Although the Bible\n\ndoesn’t outright approve of gambling, there are some questions a\n\nChristian can answer to help discern their truth. This philosophy contends that gambling might be permissible for a Christian if four conditions are met:\n\n1.\n\nWhat is staked must belong to the gambler and must be at his free\n\ndisposal. It is wrong, therefore, for the lawyer to stake the money of\n\nhis client, or for anyone to gamble with what is necessary for the\n\nmaintenance of his wife and children.2. The gambler must act freely, without unjust compulsion.3. There\n\nmust be no fraud in the transaction, although the usual ruses of the\n\ngame may be allowed. It is unlawful, accordingly, to mark the cards, but\n\nit is permissible to conceal carefully from an opponent the number of\n\ntrump cards one holds.4. Finally,\n\nthere must be some sort of equality between the parties to make the\n\ncontract equitable; it would be unfair for a combination of two expert\n\nwhilst players to take the money of a couple of mere novices at the\n\ngame.”(7)\n\nClose\n\nHowever, even those who subscribe to this philosophy concede that low deposit gambling can lead to problems. For example, if gambling leads to a squandering of time and money then it may be “a source of sin and ruin to others.” Like other addictions, gambling can arouse excitement in the participant and may lead to conduct which is difficult to control. (8)\n\nUnder\n\nthis view of Christian liberties and what the Bible does not\n\nspecifically address about gambling, the acceptance of gambling is then\n\nconditioned upon the presence of all four of the above requirements and\n\nthe self-discipline of the gambler. Such a philosophy allowed Mr.\n\nBennett to gamble without being morally conflicted. If you can handle\n\nit, that’s fine, but if you “can’t handle it, don’t do it.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nLet me be straight with you. I was excited to share a few reflections about “Men and Women in the Word.” But I wasn’t super stoked when I saw that I’d been assigned to write about Aaron. Aaron. Really? Moses’s right-hand man? The guy who made the golden calf? What more was there to say about a person who nearly caused the destruction of Israel a few days after God parted the Red Sea?\n\nI wrote down a few adjectives—words that described my assumptions about Aaron. To me, he seemed like a charismatic guy. A classic over-achiever. A man who was called by God, but also bent on pleasing people. The more I jotted down the adjectives, the more I realized I was describing myself.\n\nAaron has a complicated story. Before God appeared to Moses in the burning bush, He’d already called Aaron to start moving toward Moses to help him. In the story of Israel’s redemption, Aaron played a massive role—speaking on behalf of Moses, who spoke on behalf of God. He saw God’s miracles firsthand. He called down plagues to strike Egypt and spare Israel. He walked through the Red Sea on dry land, surrounded by water like walls. \n\nNot long after those miracles, Moses left Aaron in charge while he went to Mount Sinai and received instructions from God on how to build the future tabernacle (Exodus 25–31). Moses had been on the mountain for more than 40 days, longer than he’d planned to be gone. Soon, cajoled by the Israelites, Aaron assumed Moses had died. While Moses was hearing instructions from the Lord, Aaron was busy building a golden calf.\n\nUnable to wait patiently for God’s instructions, he moved on with his own plans. Comfortable in his position of power, he used his gifts to lead people astray. Aaron was of feeble mind and character, and he was quick to turn his back on the one true God.\n\nAs Moses came down from the mountain to see this ghastly scene, the truth was revealed. God may have called Aaron into holy service, but Aaron wasn’t holy. He was impatient, charismatic, and reckless. He was a sinner in need of saving. Aaron was just like me. \n\nThough God went on to punish the Israelites for their sin, he spared Aaron. In His mercy and grace, God allowed Aaron to see the tabernacle, fully built. Compared to the golden calf Aaron created with his feeble hands, the tabernacle was a spectacle of beauty, a moveable house constructed with expertise to God’s exact specifications (Exodus 4:30). Aaron was the first high priest to serve there, charged with carrying out sacrifices for the people. In that role, I imagine Aaron came to understand his need for atonement. As he sacrificed real animals, spilling real blood, I wonder if he continued to repent over that first, false image that he’d created.\n\nWe are all Aaron. Called by God, and yet capable of turning our back on Him. Gifted, and yet capable of using those gifts for our own glory rather than God’s instruction. We are all sinners, in need of an atoning sacrifice. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nWe assume Miriam was simply the sister who watched her barely weaned brother float helplessly down the river, then witnessed his miraculous rescue by the hands of Pharaoh’s daughter. But there is so much more to her.\n\nIt was Miriam who boldly offered to retrieve a nurse for the princess and then ran to her mother to reunite her with her boy. (What a girl!)\n\nMiriam saw her people spared from the twelve plagues that struck all of Egypt. She then fled with her people when Pharoah miraculously let them go. \n\nWith dry sand of the Red Sea between her toes, Miriam watched towers of water stand at attention for her people’s passing. \n\nIt was Miriam who busted out her tambourine and led the people of God in a holy conga line to celebrate Israel’s deliverance: “Sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted; he has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea” (Exodus 15:21).\n\nThis is a woman of conviction. This is a woman of faith. This is a woman of praise. \n\nBut she is not (and neither are we) a woman without need for a Savior. \n\nNumbers 12 feels out of place in the snapshots of Miriam’s life. It reads more like a scene from one of our family vacations. The siblings are at each other’s throats. What about exactly? The Lord’s favor. Who deserves it? Who doesn’t? Who has more than their share?\n\nTurns out even prophetesses are prone to spiritual envy. \n\nWith rebellion in their hearts, Miriam and Aaron grumbled. “They said, ‘Does the LORD speak only through Moses? Does he not also speak through us?’ And the Lord heard it” (v.2). The Lord responded in anger, striking Miriam with temporary leprosy. Why? Because here’s the truth about spiritual envy: it uncovers our lack of faith.\n\nWhen we resent and covet the blessings God has given others… When we worry someone else’s adequacy is a commentary on our inadequacy… When we look at someone else’s piece-of-the-kingdom pie and worry we will get the crumbs left over… When we want to trade in our gifts for something more “flashy”… \n\nSpiritual envy reveals little pockets in our hearts that are still absent of faith, corners not yet convinced that God is faithful and good. We doubt even when we’ve been delivered, after we’ve seen Him make a way where there seemed to be no way. This means we cannot rest on yesterday’s praise, because we will never stop needing Him. Life will never stop giving us opportunities to choose to trust that He will come through. \n\nYes, Miriam is a woman who lived her life for God’s glory. But He is glorified in her weakness, as is He is in her faith. Her dramatic delivery from slavery points to a more important need. She needed to be rescued from her sinful heart. She needed to be set free from her shame. So do I. So do you. Because Jesus is faithful to do it, let us bust out our tambourines in praise. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nIn the past, I’ve made an idol out of calling. There were countless times when I cried out to God, asking Him to “make it clear” what it is He wanted me to do with this life. While it’s true that I really did want to know how to spend my days and focus my attention, what I really wanted was certainty. I thought if God could just point me in the generally right direction, I could start hustling to make something of myself. What I wanted was the assurance I wouldn’t fail. I wanted control. \n\nBut God doesn’t offer us the assurance of this kind of control. He does, however, promise His faithful love and His promise to be present with His people (Deuteronomy 31:6; Hebrews 13:5). Our God is not the means to an end—He’s the beginning, the end, and everything in between (Revelation 22:13). And so calling isn’t so much a sure destination but an invitation into deeper relationship with our Creator God. \n\nOne of the ways God has invited me to experience Him is through the gifts He’s given me. When I read about Bezalel in Exodus 31, I see God’s same commitment to be present through both calling and gifting. \n\nThe LORD also spoke to Moses: “Look, I have appointed by name Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. I have filled him with God’s Spirit,  with wisdom, understanding, and ability in every craft to design artistic works”  (Exodus 31:1–5, emphasis mine).\n\nBezalel was an artisan with a BIG call on his life: to lead in the creation of the tabernacle, where God would take up residence with His people. Still, God didn’t leave Bezalel to fend for himself in the face of such an enormous undertaking. He sent Himself—His Spirit.\n\nThe Hebrew word Ruach is translated as “God’s Spirit,” and here it refers to God’s personal presence and power coming forth to empower God’s people to do the specific tasks He’s called us to do. The Creator of the universe (Genesis 1:1) called Bezalel to create something God surely could’ve made on His own—no doubt perfectly and far more efficiently. Instead, He gifted and called a man like Bezalel. Why?\n\nBecause our God is relational, revealing His glory through creation and those who bear His image (Genesis 1:26–28). He doesn’t need us or the work of our hands, but He wants us and He invites us to share in His work. By His Spirit He gives us gifts to do that work (1 Corinthians 12:4–7). It’s a precedent He set in the garden. God is about bringing eternity here to earth now, creating space for Him to dwell—to tabernacle—with His people. For those who call Jesus Christ Lord, that meeting place is now within us, by His Spirit (2 Corinthians 6:16).\n\nWhatever the call, He’s already given us everything we need to accomplish it (1 Peter 1:3). The gifts He gives us are a vehicle through which we can know Him better, go on mission with Him to accomplish His will, bring Him glory, and care for His creation and people. Apart from Him, our gifts are useless, our calling aimless (John 15:5). But in His presence is complete and utter joy (Psalm 16:11) as we partner with Him in the restoration of His creation.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Maria Furlough\n\nAll the facts told me I could not be brave. I was twenty weeks pregnant, my unborn child had been given a fatal diagnosis, and I wanted to run away. I didn’t think I could answer God’s call to carry a baby full-term if that baby would not be mine to keep. I looked at the journey before me and the assignment God had given to me, and thought, “There is no way I can do this. I’m not strong enough.”\n\nHave you ever felt like this? Have you ever lost sleep over the fear of a circumstance? Have you ever been afraid that God might ask you to do something you cannot do?\n\nI believe that God wants to redeem our worries, and we would do well to learn from the story of Joshua. God had a very important assignment for Joshua. Moses was about to die, and it was time for the Israelites to finally stop their desert wandering to find a permanent home in the promised land. God wanted Joshua to lead them into their first battle at Jericho. He said to Joshua: “Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go” (Joshua 1:9).\n\nJoshua’s task was scary (think war and death), victory looked improbable (think impenetrable fortified city), and a whole nation hung in the balance (think no room for doubt). God knew all of this, and yet what did He say to Joshua? No matter what lies before you, “be strong and courageous” (Joshua 1:6).\n\nHow could God ask this of Joshua? How could God ask me to be brave and carry a child I knew would pass away?\n\nIt’s because of this:\n\nThe Lord will never leave us (Joshua 1:9). We might not know the twists and turns of the journey before us. But we can stand confidently, knowing the Lord will never ever leave our side.\n\nIt is the Lord God who fights for us (Joshua 23:3). God does the fighting! Joshua’s strength, my courage, your bravery—these do not come from within ourselves. No! They come from the Holy Spirit, and His power has no limits.\n\nThe Lord our God is worthy of our love and devotion (Joshua 23:9–11). God gave Joshua and his people many commands, but He gave clear emphasis to this one in particular. Jesus gives us a similar command: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself” (Luke 10:27). This is the call we’ve been given, and if our eyes are on the one who calls us, then no matter what life throws at us or what impenetrable circumstance lies ahead, we will be okay.\n\nI named my son Gideon. And during those 90 minutes he lived in my arms, God proved all of His promises to be true. Our God will never leave us. He will always fight for us. And He delights in our love for Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nI had this sneaking feeling that I was going to lock myself out of the office one day. Every once in a while, it would cross my mind that I should hide a key somewhere, just in case, but then I’d brush that thought aside. Well, what do you know, today was the day! Of course, my coworkers were gone for the day, and the second the door latched behind me I knew I’d forgotten my key. They say hindsight is 20/20, but it doesn’t do you much good when you’re trapped on the wrong side of the door, pulling up Google on your phone to find a locksmith. \n\nSometimes we feel that nagging urge to act, and we just stuff it down. Getting locked out of an office is a minor inconvenience, but what about when the urge to act comes from the Lord? What about when that holy nudge requires you to step out in faith? \n\nRahab is a woman who saw what was coming and chose to act in obedience. She didn’t obey because she was an especially godly person. Far from it, in fact. The book of Joshua tells us that Rahab was a prostitute. But despite her moral failings, Rahab recognized the power of God. When Joshua’s two spies were in need of a hiding place, Rahab sensed they were men of the one true God. Though she barely knew this God, Rahab put her faith in Him and betrayed her own king (Hebrews 11:31). \n\nHow did a woman living so far from God take such an enormous leap of faith? A single act of courage, that’s how. That’s all it took to completely change the future for Rahab and her family. Although she had only heard of the power and goodness of God, she recognized what He was doing and stepped out in faith. This foresight saved the lives of Rahab and her family, and she went on to become part of the lineage of Jesus Himself (Matthew 1:1–6). \n\nJust as God worked through Rahab, He delights in using women from every walk of life to tell His grand story of redemption. It doesn’t matter what you have or haven’t done in the past. You don’t need to be a “perfect Christian” for God to call you to action. You don’t need to be a perfect Christian to listen to that still, small voice and “see it coming,” whatever it may be. God does not wait for us to get it together in order to weave us into His plan of redemption. “Instead, God has chosen what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen what is weak in the world to shame the strong” (1 Corinthians 1:27). \n\nIf you are hearing a voice that says you can’t be used by God, that you’re too much of this or too little of that, let me tell you that voice is not from the Lord. Maybe God’s given you a dream, but you’re not taking the next step because of these critical voices. Would you join me in throwing off that spirit of condemnation? Our courage comes not because we believe we are strong, but because we know that God can do anything. If He calls us He will also equip us for His work. Let’s be women who see what God is doing, and follow Him in faith. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nAbout ten years ago, my husband and I, newly married and eager to serve, volunteered to teach the preschoolers at our little church. Most Sundays were a blur of crayons and goldfish crackers, and our primary goal was for each child to take home a scribbled-on coloring sheet as proof that we tried to teach them something about Jesus. \n\nBut I remember one Sunday morning, we arrived to teach a lesson plan about Deborah, Barak, and Jael. I skimmed the story and shot a worried glance at my husband. We were supposed to teach this story? About a woman who drives a tent peg through the head of a military leader? To three-and-four-year olds? I had not had enough coffee for that. \n\nI actually don’t remember what we did that day in class, but I don’t think we read the kids that part of the story. It’s the part of the story that most of us remember, because it’s wild and gruesome, though full of strong women. All of that is true, of course, but at its heart, the story of Deborah and Barak and Jael and Sisera is about God and having confidence in Him. \n\nA lot can be said and unpacked about Barak and his trepidation, the seemingly impossible battle he faced, and how his attitude contrasted with Deborah’s, and later Jael’s. But this story offers us more than a study of human weakness overwhelmed by the glory and power of God; it offers us a picture of a woman, strong and wise, counted upon by the whole nation of Israel and chosen by God, who walked in obedience to Yahweh. \n\nDeborah heard from God, shared His Word with Barak, and supported Barak as he reluctantly followed God’s order. Deborah rebuked him when necessary but still went with him into battle. And then, after the victory against Sisera’s army and Sisera’s gruesome death at the hands of Jael, Deborah and Barak sang of praise. \n\nTheir song is a rich poem, full of beauty and truth and focused on the glory of God—how He delivered His people and destroyed His enemies. Deborah was a woman inspired by God’s Word and His faithfulness to her people. She was unafraid because she knew that come what may, our God fights for those who trust in Him (Deuteronomy 20:3–4). May God’s Word so fuel us to stand for His truth, to support our brothers and sisters in faith, and to sing His glory for the rest of our earthly lives. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nI am not like the child who keeps asking. I am like the one who asks once, receives a “no,” and leaves dejected. Persistence is not a particularly strong skill of mine, and it takes a great deal of attention for me to know what I desire most of the time. This may be rare. I know many women whose desires are potent, present, and always before them. They posture themselves before God asking and asking and asking again for Him to meet their desires. We have all been given different measures of faith (Romans 12:3).\n\nIn this passage, Gideon is an asker who won’t take “yes” for an answer. He wants reassurance even after God responds to his request: “‘Don’t be angry with me; let me speak one more time. Please allow me to make one more test with the fleece. Let it remain dry, and the dew be all over the ground’” (Judges 6:39). In the end, God gives him the reassurance he’s asked for: God’s presence goes with Gideon in battle.\n\nI sometimes wonder why God entertained Gideon’s request. Was God bolstering Gideon’s faith, bit by bit, before leading Gideon into battle? After all, God had already answered Gideon. But God met Gideon right where he was, giving him what he needed in the moment, progressing Gideon’s faith—growing it, bolstering it, and filling it to overflowing.\n\nWhen we ask God for something again and again, it doesn’t always mean we’re petulant children, whining about how unfair life is. Sometimes it means we’re inching closer and closer to seeing the enormity of God’s overwhelming help, love, and presence, which seem almost too good to be true.\n\nWhen we ask God for what we don’t think is humanly possible, we acknowledge our utter inability to bring it to pass. We submit to the truth of His absolute sovereignty over all things. This is what Gideon shows us about God and man: the beautiful practice of God’s children seeking and asking, and the spectacular gift of God’s presence with us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nThe height of a Disney princess ranges from five foot four to five foot seven—nothing more, nothing less. How do I know this, you ask? It’s the one fact that shattered all of my childhood aspirations in an instant. Standing at five foot ten, I’ve come to resent the last three inches that kept me from frolicking around the Magic Kingdom as Ariel, Belle, Snow White, or Pocahontas. It wasn’t just some childhood fantasy; it was a potential career path, guys.\n\nI realize this is not that big of a deal. If I were five foot four, I probably would have had aspirations of being in the WNBA, falling several inches below the basketball hoop. Yes, we’ve all wished for more or for less, or just to step on over to the other side of the fence where the grass sure does look a whole lot greener. \n\nWe’ve all had those Goldilocks moments in our lives, times when the porridge is too hot or the chair is too small, the job is too difficult, the relationship too painful, or the circumstance too out of control.\n\nAfter losing her husband and two sons, it’s no surprise that Naomi felt as if her life had become more than she could handle. And so when Ruth and Orpah, her daughters-in-law, offer to stay with her, Naomi tells them, “No, my daughters, my life is much too bitter for you to share, because the LORD’s hand has turned against me” (Ruth 1:13).\n\nToo bitter. \n\nHow often do we believe God has turned against us when life begins to feel like too much? And yet the overwhelming circumstances we find ourselves in, the ones that make us feel like we’ll never be enough or have enough—these are the richest soil for God’s redemption. He loves to meet us in the places where we’ve given up and then shower us with His abundance. \n\nRuth could have easily walked away from Naomi, leaving her mother-in-law alone in her bitterness, just as God could have easily rejected us in our unfaithfulness. Thankfully, that’s not how the story goes. Both women chose to travel together, dusting off their wounds and collecting their sorrows. They didn’t know what they would find next, but they left “Moab, because [Naomi] had heard in Moab that the Lord had paid attention to his people’s need by providing them food” (v.6).\n\nIf you’ve read this story before, you already know that God provided much more than food for these women. He gave Ruth a new husband, and in turn, Naomi also received a new son. But the story of Naomi and Ruth is about more than a God who will give us whatever we want and make all our dreams come true, if we’ll just muster up enough faith to believe in Him. This story, and all of Scripture, is about a God who is faithful when we are not.\n\nLet us look to the One whose power is perfected in our weakness; He promises that His grace is exactly what we need—what our sin requires—and it is sufficient for everyone who leaves behind the ways of this world in order to follow Him (2 Corinthians 12:9). “Blessed be the LORD,” who redeems and restores (Ruth 4:14).\n\n",

As so many women who have come after her, Hannah was greatly grieved by her circumstances. “Deeply hurt, Hannah prayed to the LORD and wept with many tears” (1 Samuel 1:10). Through her story, we are given an example of what it means to approach God honestly with our pain. \n\nGod cares about our pain. He knows how many tears you and I have cried (Psalm 56:8). Just as He cared about Hannah’s deep pain, He cares about yours and mine too. God wants us to know what to do with our hurt, and that He will meet us in our suffering. We can start by taking our pain to Him in bold and honest prayer, just as Hannah did: \n\n“LORD of Armies, if you will take notice of your servant’s affliction,  remember and not forget me, and give your servant a son,  I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life” (v.11). \n\nGod hears the cries of our hearts. “The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears, and rescues them from all their troubles” (Psalm 34:17). He is worthy of our trust, which is something Hannah truly believed. Scripture tells us that after praying, “Hannah went on her way; she ate and no longer looked despondent” (1 Samuel 1:18). Hannah did not yet know whether God was going to give her a child, but she went away confident that He had heard her plea. As should we!\n\nGod comforts us in our pain. I understand the relief that comes from honest prayer. After losing my son, I prayed to God repeatedly, sobbing, “I want him back right now!” In that deep, unimaginable pain, I found Him to be the tender God of all comfort (2 Corinthians 1:3). I also found that His Word is true; He truly “is near the brokenhearted; he saves those crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18).\n\nWe don’t need to be ashamed of our pain. When Eli accuses Hannah of being drunk, she tells him like it is: “I am a woman with a broken heart” (v.15). No excuses, no shame, no embarrassment. Sadness is part of the human condition that points to our need for a saving God. It is okay to be sad. Hannah’s honest prayer points to God’s reliable power and goodness. And so she declares, “There is no one holy like the LORD. There is no one besides you!” (1 Samuel 2:2). \n\nGod did give Hannah a son, yes, but more than that, He gave her the peace of His presence. He is with us as well. In His presence, may we learn to rejoice in Him always—regardless of our circumstances. May we learn to bring Him the deepest longings of our hearts, “through prayer and petition with thanksgiving. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding” will be ours (Philippians 4:4,6–7). He waits to comfort us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nI was in the sixth grade the first time I felt a desire to open my Bible on my own. I’d had a particularly rough day at school (aren’t middle school girls the worst?), and as I sobbed into my New Kids on the Block pillow, suddenly my pink Precious Moments Bible seemed to call to me from the bookshelf. It wasn’t an audible sound, just a subtle heart tug toward the Word of God I’d never felt before that moment. I didn’t know a psalm from a proverb, couldn’t articulate the gospel, and had no way of knowing how God’s Word would eventually transform me. I just knew I needed comfort and thought the Bible might be a straw worth grasping for. \n\nA tiny spark was kindled, but the ember was enough to keep me reading through middle school and into high school, when I would eventually surrender my life to Christ. The spark is now a bonfire that consumes my life. Like the psalmist, I declare, “Instruction from your lips is better for me than thousands of gold and silver pieces” (Psalm 119:72). God’s Word is my greatest treasure. \n\nThe Bible tells us, “Samuel did not yet know the Lord, because the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him” (1 Samuel 3:7). And yet the Lord was clearly speaking to the boy. Though Samuel’s inexperience with the voice of God made him slow to respond, the Lord kept patiently nudging until eventually, “Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and he fulfilled everything Samuel prophesied. All Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was a confirmed prophet of the Lord” (vv.19–20). \n\nHe is the hound of heaven. He pursues us when we are still running in glad rebellion. He woos us when our hearts are still turned toward lesser loves. He shepherds before we, His sheep, can distinguish the sound of His voice. Truly, “God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). \n\nSamuel learned to serve the God who speaks. I have learned to love the One whose story I first glimpsed in the pages of a little pink Bible. It’s true that when we seek, we find Him. And when we knock, He always opens the door (Matthew 7:7–8). But the Lord, in His kindness, also whispers to us before our hearts know how to listen. He loves us, even if our hearts are too broken to love Him back (1 John 4:9). Because He speaks, we can know Him—and that is a reason to rejoice.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nFor me, reading through 1 Samuel is like learning Israel’s history for the very first time. I’ve been so fascinated by this story because Saul seems so well-intentioned, at least based on outward appearance. But when I look a little closer, I realize that Saul was a man of great fear, one who was constantly seeking the approval of other people. What’s more, Saul shrouded his insecurity in half-obedience to the Lord. \n\nUgh. Knife in the gut. \n\nI could so easily replace Saul’s name with my own in both of the sentences above. I am a woman of great fear. I hide all of my insecurity by pretending I’m following the Lord, when really, I’m looking for other people’s approval.\n\nIn today’s reading, Saul’s habit of half-obedience is on full display—twice. In Chapter 10, the prophet Samuel is surrounded by crowds, and the people are looking around, trying to find Saul to put a crown on his head and officially make him their king. Saul already knows he’s been chosen, but he’s so very fearful of the job that he literally goes and hides himself in a big pile of baggage (1 Samuel 10:22).\n\nThe metaphor is too good to pass up. Hiding in baggage? Yep, I totally do that too. And I think I do it for two paradoxical reasons. First, I hide because I’m afraid; I’d much rather be hiding in the shadows than be up front where if I fall or make a mistake, people will see. The baggage—my past mistakes, what other people have said about me, the lies I believe about myself—allows me to keep a safe distance from any kind of leadership.\n\nI also hide because I want to be important enough to be found. Scripture tells us that after Saul hid himself, the people ran and brought him out, shouting, “Long live the king!” (v.24). That must have felt nice. He was so important, that even though he was hiding, the people wouldn’t let him hide for long. They came and found him and put him in the spotlight. Maybe that’s what Saul really wanted: to feel chosen by the people. Perhaps being anointed by God wasn’t enough, because he wanted the seal of approval from the people more. \n\nIn Chapter 13, Saul commits a sin fatal to his kingship when he offers burnt offerings on the altar only entrusted to Samuel (vv.1–14). His action is one of half-obedience. He was told to wait, and he did wait—but only for so long. He knew that there would be sacrifices, and so he took those sacrifices into his own hands. He wanted to prove to the men around him that he was doing something. He was afraid of being deserted, not by God, but by his soldiers. Once again, his obedience to God was only a farce to hide his reliance upon others. Saul feared man—not God. \n\nBut here’s the thing: God had already chosen Saul, and God has already chosen us (1 Peter 2:9; Ephesians 1:4). We do not need to hide. And we do not need to be found, because we will never be deserted by Him. Even if everyone else falls away, even when we fail, God will never desert us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nLast year, I turned 30, and my best friend threw me a surprise party to end all surprise parties. It included an original song, a tropical photo booth, fifty of my favorite people, and a game that requires you to eat a donut off a string (a not-so-subtle nod to her tenth birthday, where we played the same game and I had a crumb stuck in my eye for the rest of the night). For me, that birthday signaled two things: the incredible blessing of my friends and the end of my youth. \n\nTurning 30 kind of makes you rethink all of your life choices. \n\nAlthough my feelings about growing older were a little melodramatic, the truth is that things were changing. My body just isn’t twenty anymore. \n\nI find it interesting that in 1 Samuel, the Lord rejects what the prophet believes is obvious king material—physical appeal and strength—but favors David, who is also handsome with “beautiful eyes” (16:12). The qualifying trait here can’t be physical appearance because God makes it clear in His choice that “humans see what is visible, but the LORD sees the heart” (v.7). So, why David? He had the looks and health he would need for success, but we’re also told that he had a heart that would carry out the Lord’s will (Acts 13:22). That soft heart always appears to be key to spiritual flourishing. \n\nAlthough David’s good health no doubt benefited his leadership, it was his devotion to God that helped guard him against ultimate destruction. When his youth and virility waned, along with many of the characteristics that traditionally make for a great king, he still had a heart overflowing with praise.    \n\nSurrounded by friends and family at that surprise party, I imagine I felt a sliver of what David did when he burned with thanksgiving for God’s blessing. When I look back on my life thus far through a kingdom-oriented lens, my sorrow for things lost slowly turns to gratitude for things given. Sure, I wish my eyes didn’t look so permanently tired and my muscles moved like hot taffy, rather than a seat belt after stopping short. But when I assess the work of God in my life, and in the lives of others, it can be too overwhelming to bear sometimes. Each fine line and sore ligament serves as a testimony to the adventure of being sanctified.\n\nPeople may only look at you skin deep, but our Lord sees the wild rivers of courage, affection, and sacrifice under the surface. It’s an upside-down kingdom, after all. Whoever surrenders their youth finds wisdom and maturity (hopefully)—and whoever loses their life for the sake of Christ will find it (Matthew 10:39). \n\nNo matter what my appearance or circumstances or achievements or health status indicates, I want to echo the words of King David: “For You, Lord GOD, have spoken, and with Your blessing Your servant’s house will be blessed forever” (2 Samuel 7:29). The blessing God gave David’s lineage, that eventually gave way to Christ, continues into our lives today. We can never age out of it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScrolling through social media, you’re likely to see posts with comment threads a mile long. If you dare to unfold those threads, they’re often divisive and negative. The distance created by an online world makes it easier for tempers to flare and harsh words to be thrown like daggers. I find myself wanting to retreat from social media for this very reason. When we sense danger, many of us have a tendency either to jump into the fight or to take flight. But the story of Abigail offers us a third and better way to respond. \n\nIt couldn’t have been easy for the “intelligent and beautiful” Abigail to be married to Nabal (1 Samuel 25:3). He was a foolish and harsh man, and when David sent his young men to him for provisions, Nabal almost incited a war. Nabal’s lack of generosity sparked David’s temper, and David began planning his retaliation. \n\nOnce Abigail heard what was going on, she took action—but not to join in the fight or to run for cover. While her husband had been unnecessarily loud and offensive and David was quick to seek revenge, Abigail was a swift peacemaker. With David organizing his army and calling for blood, others may have assumed a battle was inevitable. But Abigail still had hope that things could be resolved peacefully. With wisdom, she discerned how to repair an extremely heated situation. Abigail approached David with humility and generosity, and was able to bring healing to a gaping wound caused by her husband’s foolishness. \n\nAbigail helped bring peace to two men, thus saving many lives from death and destruction. Jesus praised peacemaking saying, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God” (Matthew 5:9, NIV). Not only did Jesus value the virtue of peacemaking, but He embodied it. He chose to lay down His life in order to offer true and everlasting peace to all people through His death and resurrection. \n\nThe way Abigail responded is beautiful because it mirrors the heart of God. Scripture tells us that the new heavens and new earth will be a place with no need for weapons or war (Isaiah 2:4). In a divided and conflicted world, we are called to be agents of peace. Just as Abigail could have easily given up hope, it can be tempting for us to think the problems in our society are unsolvable. But Christ has can bring peace to the darkest situations. Our God can breathe life into the driest of bones. Instead of fighting or retreating, let’s respond to conflict around us with discernment and generosity in the power of the Holy Spirit. Then our actions of peace will be a witness to the heart of our loving Creator. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nEditor’s Note: Some passages in Scripture deal in subject matter which might be especially painful for some readers. Though many of the wounds we receive in this life are deeply personal and unimaginably painful, when they appear in God’s Word, we are reminded that He sees them. Whenever sin is addressed in Scripture—whether through teaching or story—it comes to us in the context of God’s unwavering commitment to bring an end to all evil in this world through the finished work of Christ (Revelation 21:3–4). We are praying for and with you as you read. \n\nOne of the most scandalous stories recorded in Scripture involves King David and Bathsheba, the wife of one of his trusted warriors. David’s sexual sin against Bathsheba is condemned by Nathan and confessed by David himself. His blame has never been in question. Often called “an affair,” Bathsheba’s involvement is less than clear, however. Helpfully, Scripture offers valuable context to help us navigate the culture of that time. \n\nScripture records a detail that tells us something important about Bathsheba; she was bathing to cleanse herself after her monthly cycle (2 Samuel 11:4). For women practicing the Jewish faith, this was commanded, to bathe after monthly menstruation. This is important because it tells us that Bathsheba had chosen to obey the commandments of the covenant and honor Yahweh. We know Bathsheba lived protected within the city because David was able to see her bathing on her rooftop from the comfort of his own home. \n\nLet’s take a minute to remind ourselves that this woman wasn’t a character in a story or an actor in a movie.  Bathsheba was a real woman, living in the ancient Near East under the militaristic, political, and cultural control of King David. Bathsheba had real fears, life pressures, and hopeful expectations. Like us, Bathsheba was likely both strong and fearful. Like us, she probably wanted to make a life, build a family, and care for her friends. She likely worried about her future and her reputation. \n\nI imagine Bathsheba never envisioned the turn her life would take. She would lose her first husband and bury her first son with David. Sadly, much of Bathsheba’s story is shaped by what was likely the hardest season of her life, when she was swept up into the center of scandal, shame, and heartache. Though the circumstances may be different, I suspect many of us know this sting. And in the midst of that kind of turmoil, we can all be tempted to wonder things like:\n\nWhere is God? \n\nWhy has He allowed this to happen? \n\nCan He redeem even this?\n\nBut Bathsheba’s story wasn’t over. God wasn’t finished working in and through her. Heartache wouldn’t have the last word—not for Bathsheba, and not for you or for me. Mercifully, Scripture records other instances where Bathsheba would help lead, influence, and shape God’s story for His people. Scripture attests to her humility before the Lord and her bravery before King David, as she advocated for her son Solomon take his God-appointed place as king of Israel (1 Kings 1:11–40).\n\nWhere Bathsheba looked forward in faith, we have the unbelievable privilege of looking back in gratitude. Because of Jesus, we can be confident that even the darkest days and the most heart-wrenching circumstances can be redeemed. If the cross brought everlasting life, then nothing in our lives can be so ruinous that God can’t use it for our good and His glory.\n\n",

Though many of the wounds we receive in this life are deeply personal and unimaginably painful, when they appear in God’s Word, we are reminded that He sees them. Whenever sin is addressed in Scripture—whether through teaching or story—it comes to us in the context of God’s unwavering commitment to bring an end to all evil in this world through the finished work of Christ (Revelation 21:3-4). We are praying for and with you as you read. \n\nThere are certain stories in Scripture that cause me to blink back tears every time I read them—Abraham leading Isaac up the mountain for sacrifice, Jesus begging God to take the cup from Him in the garden of Gethsemane, and Peter’s denial of Jesus, just to name a few.\n\nTamar’s story causes me to both blink back tears and shake with anger. It’s a difficult story to stomach, and I get more queasy with every verse I read. It brings up memories I’d rather forget and questions of God’s justice that I’d rather not ask: How could God allow something like this to happen to Tamar? She was just an innocent girl. She didn’t deserve this injustice. She didn’t ask for this.\n\nThese are the same sort of questions I ask myself every time another #MeToo story breaks on the news. They are the same questions I ask every time I hear another one of my friends tell a story from a time in their life when someone went a little too far, when an unforeseeable circumstance brought about unbearable pain and trauma. \n\nTamar’s story is not one that you hear preached about on Sunday mornings. It’s not suitable for young ears, and for some, it’s definitely triggering. If the Bible were a movie, Tamar’s story would push it to receive an R rating. But the same thing that’s true of all the stories women and men have brought into light over the last couple of years is also true here: they all have value, and we need to hear them. Tamar’s story is important because God saw fit to include it in His Word.\n\nTamar’s story allows survivors of sexual assault to see themselves in Scripture. It helps them see that they are not alone—that they, like Tamar, did not deserve this injustice. And because we know God’s character, we know that when we cry out morning, noon, and night—when we tear our clothes with grief like Tamar—He hears us (Psalm 55:17). He sees us. He meets us in the midst of our distress, and reminds us that we are His. He promises He will “not leave the guilty unpunished” (Exodus 34:6–7), that He will “[execute] justice for the exploited” (Psalm 146:6–7). \n\nSo although Tamar’s story is so painful we’d often rather forget it happened, we would do well to see her in her pain and recognize that God is still at work. He is still at the center of her story, and He remains at the center of ours as well.\n\n",

I see us in the twisted feet and pitiful heart of Mephibosheth. As he grovels before King David and asks, “What is your servant that you take an interest in a dead dog like me?” (2 Samuel 9:8), I hear an echo of David’s own words in Psalm 8:4: “What is a human being that you remember him, a son of man that you look after him?”\n\nWhy would a perfect God love one as broken as I am? I am surely damaged goods. Yet, He does not cast me aside. \n\nThe story of Mephibosheth is a shadow of the sweetness of the Lord. Mephibosheth had a heritage of rebellion. His grandfather Saul ran from the law of the Lord in more ways than I have the keystrokes to recount, before dying in shame surrounded by his enemies. Disgrace might have seemed a fitting end to Mephibosheth’s story. Yet, he received grace instead. Plucked from the mire, he was given a seat at the king’s table. It’s a story that should ring some bells. Though we deserve darkness, we are welcome to pull up a chair to the table of the King of kings. \n\n“Let us be glad, rejoice, and give him glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his bride has prepared herself.”\n– Revelation 19:7\n\nCrippled by the sins of his ancestors, and surely humbled by his own, Mephibosheth was the recipient of the king’s extravagant kindness. Instead of the poster child for brokenness, he became the poster child for grace. \n\nFast forward to the book of Acts. The world is being transformed in the wake of the gospel’s tide, when Peter and John encounter another broken man. Lame since birth, he lies daily at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, begging for scraps of mercy. Yet, he receives so much more. Peter says to him: “I don’t have silver or gold, but what I do have, I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!” (Acts 3:6).\n\nAnd he does. He jumps up. He starts to walk. He enters the temple. He is “walking, leaping, and praising God” (vv.8–9). \n\nThe people recognize him.They are filled with awe. They are astonished at what had happened to the beggar before the Beautiful Gate (v.10).\n\nFrom outcast to insider… From broken to made whole… From lame to leaping… \n\nThis is our story. This is our song. May the world be filled with wonder before our great God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nI have asked for many things in my life—a home, children, a spouse, a car that doesn’t break down, financial means to pay off my school loans, good friends, a few acres in the country. God has given me a few of these blessings, and some He still has not and might not ever. But it is rare for me to ask God for the intangible things. I like measurable. I like quantifiable. It’s difficult to measure wisdom or quantify humility or capture joy long enough to know it’s real. What’s more, the means to come by those qualities are often difficult and wrought with pain, and I don’t like pain. \n\nGod sometimes gives His people tangible gifts in an instant. It only took me three seconds to meet my husband. Two seconds to sign my name on a contract to buy our home. One second to click, “Pay in full,” on my student loans. \n\nThe gift of wisdom, though? Not so much. Wisdom takes a lifetime. \n\nBut not for Solomon. Solomon asked for wisdom, and Scripture says God gave it to him, right then and there. He told Solomon, “I will therefore do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has never been anyone like you before and never will be again” (1 Kings 3:12). For most of us, those qualities take a lifetime to develop and hone, but because Solomon’s heart desired the right thing—to please and honor God by living with wisdom and understanding—God gave it to him. \n\nThere is a kind of wisdom that is not of God; James calls it “earthly, unspiritual, demonic. For where there is envy and selfish ambition, there is disorder and every evil practice” (James 3:15–16). I often find that my desire for what I think is a good, tangible blessing often brings disorder to my affections. It seems that as soon as I get “the thing,” I forget the Giver of every good thing. But there is another kind of wisdom, the kind Solomon sought: \n\n“Wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant,  full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without pretense.  And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who cultivate peace” (vv.17–18).\n\nWould things we long for change if we first asked for wisdom from above, trusting God to meet our truest needs with a gift that cannot be quantified? Solomon’s desire for riches or houses were rightly ordered under his desire for wisdom. God honored that desire and gave it to him, and I want to be like that too.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Ahab and Jezebel",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nFor my grandma, the word “Jezebel” was synonymous with “worldly woman.” And grandma simply did not broach subjects like drinkin’ or card playin’ or movie-house goin’—no ma’am. So much of what we now allow as acceptable would have fit under her “Jezebel” heading. It’s pretty awkward to call anybody worldly, and much easier to just stand back and let “you do you.” In fact, there is a contemporary trend to even view Jezebel herself as an empowered modern women—to classify the queen of idolatry as a savvy and sassy businesswoman. How did we get so far from the truth? Is it possible my grandma was right after all?\n\nJezebel’s husband was Ahab, a notoriously evil king whose wickedness is largely attributed to Jezebel. Scripture says Ahab “devoted himself to do what was evil in the LORD’s sight, because his wife Jezebel incited him” (1 Kings 21:25). Instead of devoting themselves to do good, they set the compass one-hundred and eighty degrees in the other direction and actively sought to do evil. Theirs is a pretty condemnable legacy.\n\nYet how was Jezebel seen in her own day? If she was like Ahab, she was an able administrator and politician. She was a strong female leader who got things done. Her political marriage to Ahab brought with it an alliance to the mercantilist strength of the Phoenicians. She was a woman of her time and of her culture, and she brought her religious beliefs with her into Israel.\n\nHer devotion to Baal was a culturally normal thing to do. Baal was a god who was worshipped through music, dance, partying and debauchery, and sexual promiscuity. In return, Baal promised agricultural, social, and economic success. In contrast to the moral standards of the God of Israel, Baal made an easy appeal to man’s basest inclinations.\n\nBut Christ warns us about this very danger: “Be on your guard against false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravaging wolves” (Matthew 7:15). We know that not all leaders are trustworthy, and we know that not all success is measured in money and power. God calls us to measure our success not by the world’s standards, but by the standards of His kingdom.\n\nOn our own, we all have Jezebel hearts, offering up the sacrifices of our own choice, hoping to barter a deal for worldly success from the higher powers. The applause of the world is a deceiver. But God is not like Baal. He is holy, and He does not exchange His favor for anything we can give to Him. He is not like the gods of this world. He judges the world concerning two things: righteousness and wickedness. And this righteousness, which alone can please Him, is not native to us. It runs counter to every strain of the fallen human heart. To truly please God, to truly have His favor, we must rest wholly in the righteousness of Christ.\n\nAt the end of Jezebel’s life, she was confronted by Jehu, whom God had anointed to drive out wickedness from the land. Though Jehu was far from righteous, he nonetheless reminds us of the true anointed One, Jesus, whom God sent to earth to put an end to wickedness.\n\nWhile I do allow card playin’ and movie watchin’ in my own home, I think my grandma was on the right track about Jezebel. Run from those who seek evil. Don’t reclassify evil as empowerment. Evil will always be evil. May God be gracious to us and purify us from worldliness. May He transform us into the image of His Son, who alone is our righteousness.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nYou’re probably familiar with Robert Frost’s poem “The Road Not Taken,” which ends with these infamous lines: “Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— / I took the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the difference” (18–20).\n\nIt’s a work I’ve always loved, but I also have a few follow-up questions for Mr. Frost, like “Would you still feel the same way if the path less traveled had ended in a ditch?” and “If you’d gotten lost, wouldn’t you wish you’d taken the one more traveled by?”\n\nI don’t know the answers to either question, but I do know that decision-making is hard. For every road not taken, there’s a path we regret choosing, or a journey we still long to take. And it’s mostly because, like Frost says, our choices really do make all the difference. (No pressure, right?)\n\nAs they gathered at Mount Carmel, Elijah asked the people of Israel to make a choice between God and Baal: “How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him. But if Baal, follow him” (1 Kings 18:21).\n\nLet’s take a step back here for a moment and remind ourselves that we have the unique privilege of holding the Old and New Testaments together as the true story of redemption. The Israelites did not. So while it may be tempting to focus on Elijah’s obedience or the Baal prophets’ doubt, there’s a much larger story at play here. \n\nFirst, God gives us what we need to trust in Him. The Israelites didn’t need more research, proof, or signs; God had provided a means of knowing Him, and they just had to believe. Although, as decision makers, we are indecisive and imperfect, God is steady and perfect. He does not wrestle with or question His own decision making. He stays true to His character, and He is always on the side of both justice and love.\n\nThings get a little intense in the test between God and Baal, but when Baal’s people call his name only to receive no response, it’s clear that God is the one true God. He answers not only with a display of power, but with an invitation for His people to return to Him. He is always calling His children back home. And regardless of whether we choose the path less or frequently traveled, we can rest assured we will not be choosing alone. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nI am currently in a group text with some women who are trying (and failing) to help our friend name her fourth baby. The child is a boy, and while the list of possible names keeps growing longer—(Theo… Patrick… What about Finn?)—the reasons why she can’t choose those names keep coming too. (I like it but my neighbor used it… I don’t want him to be called “Pat”… It just doesn’t “feel right,” you know?)\n\nI don’t blame her for taking her time. Choosing a name for another human being is a sacred task and shouldn’t be taken lightly. We know this because throughout Scripture, God changes the names of His people to reflect His love and call on their lives. He gave Simon a new name, “Peter.” From that point forward, every time someone spoke his new name, Peter had the opportunity to remember that though his faith was at times shaky, Jesus had called him “the rock” on which His church would be built (Matthew 16:18). \n\nIn today’s reading, God’s tells a man named Hosea to go and marry a promiscuous woman. The call on Hosea’s life is to offer the same compassion, acceptance, and love to an undeserving woman that God has offered to His people. He chooses Gomer, and begins to create a life with her and have children with her. It’s a hard assignment, one that leaves Hosea and his children ostracized and exposed. The children are given cursed names, such as “No Compassion” and “Not My People.” \n\nCan you imagine? Everywhere these children went, they would have been reminded of their family shame and their mother’s sin. But our generous God is in the name-changing business because He is also in the life-changing business. In His economy, those who were called “not my people” can now be called “children of God.” He is the God who turns our curses into blessings.\n\nWhat name do you call yourself today? Here are a few of the names I call myself: “Not Successful” and “Not Capable,” “Excluded” and “Unwanted.” But God, through the work of Jesus Christ, invites me to shed the curse of those names and embrace the truth of His love and acceptance. My identity is now shaped by His love for me. I am His, and He calls me His “daughter.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nIn December 2015, a group of archeologists led by Dr. Eliat Mazar announced that they had found a bulla in an excavation site near the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. The bulla, a clay seal stamped with Hebrew characters, had belonged to King Hezekiah, a good king of Judah who reigned in the 7th and 8th centuries BC. I know very, very little about biblical archeology, but when I found dozens of old news articles about this little 1/2” clay circle, I thought it was pretty cool. \n\nHezekiah was a real person. He lived in a real palace, was served by the real prophet Isaiah, and he prayed real prayers to our real God. And almost three thousand years later, utilizing a method called “wet sifting” (an archeological process using mesh trays flooded with water), someone discovered an impression in clay made by King Hezekiah’s royal seal. \n\nThe two prayers from today’s reading in 2 Kings and Isaiah reveal much about Hezekiah’s character, and his real, flesh-and-bone existence. But they also reveal his utter dependence upon a very real God. In his first prayer, Hezekiah cried out before the Lord when he heard that King Sennacherib of Assyria had mocked God and threatened the kingdom of Judah (2 Kings 19:14–19; Isaiah 37:14–20). Hezekiah’s second prayer came after he’d become very sick and was told he would die. He wept and prayed, asking the Lord to deliver him from his illness (Isaiah 38). \n\nTwice, Hezekiah prayed for God’s deliverance, and twice God delivered him; Sennacherib was defeated, and Hezekiah was healed. His third prayer is a poem of reflection about his experience of being so near imminent death, about feeling the brittleness of his bones and the fragility of his flesh:\n\n“I waited patiently till dawn, but like a lion he broke all my bones; day and night you made an end of me. I cried like a swift or thrush, I moaned like a mourning dove. My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens. I am being threatened; Lord, come to my aid!” – Isaiah 38:13–14 (NIV)\n\nIn reflecting upon his own emotional state while facing death, Hezekiah conceded, “Indeed it was for my own well-being that I had such intense bitterness” (v.17). In the face of death and destruction, both external (at the hands of Sennacherib) and internal (because of his own illness), Hezekiah trusted in, relied upon, and sought the favor of the immortal, all-powerful, very real God. \n\nSo often, I try to find my security and safety in the physical, but Hezekiah’s story—his real, lived, embodied, true story—reminds me that whatever I face in life or death, I can rely on the same immortal, all-powerful God. This is a God for whom evidence cannot be sifted out of trays doused in water, but a God who has proven Himself to be real, time and time again through His Word, His faithfulness, His miraculous work, and by His Son. A God who so loved us that He came to earth, flesh and blood, incarnate and holy, real, to prove that love. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nEvery time I fly and I hear the phrase, “Please make sure your oxygen mask is secure before helping anyone else,” I wonder how it would feel to be a parent, desperate to put a mask on their child to the detriment of their own life. But I see the temptation exists for us everywhere: to give before we’ve received, to pour out before we’ve been poured into. And worse, it’s a part of Christian culture to do so. We laud service and eschew Sabbath. We exalt work and neglect rest. We praise doers and overlooker hearers. We try to feed others before we’ve been fed ourselves. We are in a crisis of care in many spheres of life today. No matter our vocation, it can be tempting to pour out before we allow ourselves to truly be cared for, poured into, and ministered to by the Word of God. \n\nThis was the climate into which the prophet Ezekiel was speaking. In today’s passage, the Lord appears to Ezekiel and, essentially, says, “Eat my words and then go speak them to others” (Ezekiel 2:8, my paraphrase). God’s people were in exile, going about their duties, beginning and ending each day exactly the same, the monotony unending. Ezekiel’s vision was intended to interrupt their trance of sameness, to give them a picture and a promise of something better. \n\nBut Ezekiel would have been unable to rightly or compellingly convince anyone of anything better if he had not first eaten, chewed on, swallowed, and subsisted on the Word of God. He had to be fed before he could feed others. He had to put on the oxygen mask of God’s message before he could put it on others. \n\nIn the same way, the world is asking us to fill spaces, to show up, be something, be everything, speak something, say anything, do something, do everything, but we often feel like walking air-pockets, void of anything of substance inside us. Have you been there? I know I have. The Word of God is food for us, just as it was for Ezekiel. And our food is to do the will of God, just as it was for Jesus (John 4:34). We are called to breathe in what He has given us in His Word, and then to go and speak it to everyone we know. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nSocrates famously declared, “I am wise because I know that I know nothing.” There is certainly a kind of paradoxical wisdom in his statement that is admirable, but it is still only the wisdom of men. It is the same kind of wisdom we see displayed by the Chaldean wise men who advised Nebuchadnezzar. They knew that they knew nothing. They could not penetrate the deep mysteries of unremembered dreams. This was the realm of the gods alone, those who did not dwell with men (Daniel 2:11).\n\nBut the wisdom of God is higher than the wisdom of men, and in Daniel we see a wisdom that far surpasses that of Socrates. It’s in a whole different category. The wisdom of Daniel is this: he knew that true wisdom is from God alone, the Creator of heaven and earth. Furthermore, he knew that the one true God was not like the gods of the Chaldeans, gods who were neither all-knowing nor all-powerful. Daniel knew that he served a God who was both of those things, yet also near to His people. \n\nWhile living in exile, Daniel and his friends understood that they dwelt in a land of deep darkness, a land of idolatry, harsh kings, and the threat of death. But their security was not in a king’s decrees, or the wisdom of the Chaldeans. They found security bowing on their knees before the God of all wisdom and power. He was their true Lord and King, and in serving Him, they did not need to fear the whims of man (v.20–21).\n\nIn a remarkable turn of providence, the very lives of the wise men of the world are preserved by the intercession of Daniel (v.24). Like Christ’s parable of the mustard seed (Matthew 13:31–32), where even the birds of the air find rest in the branches, so also the providence of God is the foundation upon which even the kingdoms of the earth must rely, for even they belong to Him.\n\nI find that I’m constantly inundated with the seeming wisdom of the world, but it is a wisdom that falls far short of the kingdom of God. The promise that Daniel foretold in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream is one that is even now being fulfilled: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign forever and ever” (Revelation 11:15). In light of such revelation, we, too, may have confidence as we approach the throne of grace, knowing that we serve a God who is not far off, but has drawn near to us, even taking on flesh and dwelling with us. This God, this Christ, is the true King of kings.\n\n",

I’ve seen that phrase all over the Internet, on Pinterest boards, college dorm room walls, and coffee mugs—used time and time again to remind us that God is still good in the midst of trials and pain and suffering. \n\nA few weeks ago, I had a really painful situation occur with one of the people I love most, and I almost lost them. I felt completely betrayed. As a result, I lost a lot of trust in that person. And it occurred to me that I have no idea how people survive the painful situations in their lives if they do not believe in God.\n\nI don’t believe in the prosperity gospel, the lie that tells us if we believe in God enough and work hard enough to somehow live lives worthy of His love, then He will lavish upon us riches and good fortune. But I do believe that every good and perfect gift comes from God (James 1:17), and that God’s good plan ultimately ends in the restoration of His kingdom and eternal life spent in worship of the Creator God (Revelation 21–22).\n\nBut is God still good when everything stable, everything you thought you knew, is ripped out from under you? Or when your boyfriend breaks your heart? Is He good when your grandmother gets cancer? Is God still good when the plans you had for your life fall apart right in front of you?\n\nYes. He is.\n\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were really good examples of living out that Pinterest-worthy saying: Even if not, He is still good. They trusted in God so fiercely that they agreed to be put in a fiery furnace to prove their heartfelt belief. They risked their lives for their faith by refusing to bow before anyone or anything but God. In doing so, they brought Him glory. And when pushed on the matter by the king, they simply said, “Even if [our God] does not rescue us, we want you as king to know that we will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up” (Daniel 3:18).\n\nTheir faith in God’s provision and protection was so strong that they were willing to walk into the fire, believing that He would save them. And they were confident in their decision because of their dedication to their God—even if He chose not to rescue them from the fire. \n\nThe same is true for us. No matter the circumstances that come our way, when we walk through the pain and trials of life, this truth remains: we are still His, and He is still ours (Isaiah 43:2). And He is still good.\n\nThe end result for these three men? A king convinced of the goodness of God and a whole empire of people now told to worship Him, instead of the false gods and idols of their past. All because of the faith of three men and their willingness to say, “Even if not, He is still good.”\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Esther",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nEsther’s bravery was a provision of God’s gracious and eternal plan. Esther had the privilege of being part of the story of Israel’s rescue. But it’s unlikely that she wanted to be anywhere near the king’s harem—she probably would have preferred to stay safely at home.\n\nAnd when calamity threatened, her cousin Mordecai prefaced his exhortation to Esther with this profound observation: “If you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jewish people from another place” (Esther 4:14).\n\nMordecai understood that the real story doesn’t depend on us, but upon God, who always accomplishes His will. Only in light of this truth can we understand what it means to live rightly in the time and place God has put us. Mordecai’s words to Esther provide three profound implications:\n\nFirst, it conveys an unwavering trust in God’s providence. Mordecai was not in doubt as to Who was Israel’s security and hope. It was not Esther. It was not himself. It was not man or the strength of men. He knew that God is faithful, that He keeps His covenant, that He alone is the preserver of His people. God alone can save.\n\nSecond, it is a reminder that God calls us to humility. When we find ourselves in a position either of pressure or of prominence, both are God’s doing, and both are for the glory of His kingdom. Mordecai mourned and repented in the public square, openly confessing His dependence on God. His call to Esther was to do the same with her position of privilege: not to use it for her own preservation or security, but to lay it at the feet of God, to yield it up to the purposes of His kingdom.\n\nThird, it frames a biblical perspective of time and history. The phrase “for such a time as this” brings to mind all of the moments when God’s unseen hand is at work in the Esther narrative. The primary action of the story is not dependent upon what people decide to do, but on what “happens,” or rather, what Providence decrees. The story moves on a series of passive verbs, indicating a divine will that guides all things. “For such a time as this” is a reminder that both the evil of the day and the opportunity to stand for justice were provisions of God’s hand. God is at work, and He works all things—even the evil that men do—for the glory of His kingdom and the good of His people. \n\nThis hope is ultimately fulfilled in Christ. The true rescue of captive Israel is foreshadowed in Esther, but accomplished in the work of Jesus’s sacrifice. He is the true Savior of Israel. He stood before the rulers and judges of the world and obeyed even to the point of death on the cross. He took upon Himself the gallows punishment so that we might be redeemed. He fought the battle for us in order to give us victory. His eternal decree has overturned the decrees of kings and rulers, of powers and principalities, and He has established a kingdom that endures and confounds the powers of this world. \n\nThis is not a story about the bravery of Esther or the wisdom of Mordecai. It is a story about the sovereign providence of God. We are all born for such a time as this, and we can depend on Christ to fulfill His promises.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nOne evening I was invited to a friend’s house to pray. The agenda was simple enough: eat snacks and mingle, settle in to spend time alone in prayer, then encourage each other. \n\nI’m not always comfortable with group events, and nine times out of ten I’ll choose a quiet evening at home over a social gathering, especially on a weeknight. But this time I went. Mostly compelled by an opportunity to catch up with some friends and the possibility of a slice of cheesecake, I reassured myself that the tender-heart time wouldn’t last too long. \n\nSeveral months later, I cannot recall how the food tasted, or what shoes I wore, or how awkward I felt. But I clearly remember how the Lord used that gathering to soften my heart in a very specific way. That night, in the quiet of the solo prayer time, the Holy Spirit impressed upon my heart just two words: make room.\n\nIn the days that followed, I considered the different ways I could make room: in my heart, on my calendar, in my home. I thought about who I could make room for: the new women moving to our burgeoning city, the people I know who need more than they have to offer, and the guy who definitely eased his way in front of me in line at the concession stand last weekend. But even before any of that, I can make room for my Lord, who promises me His presence whether I take time to be present with Him or not (John 14:16–17). \n\nAs I penciled down a list, I realized all the ways people had already made room for me: \n\nHere is my time; it’s yours now. Here is this meal; I want you to be nourished. Here is my forgiveness; I know what a gift it is to be forgiven. Here is this space to sit; I’d rather you have rest than me. Here I am entering into your sorrow, I was comfortable, but you need comfort more than me.\n\nEven more extravagant than the hospitality offered to me by others is that offered by the Father Himself:\n\nI was an orphan; He calls me His daughter (John 1:12). I was a foreigner; He made me a citizen (Ephesians 2:19). My sin made me unclean like a leper; He did not cast me out (Ephesians 2:13).\n\nHospitality, I am learning, is often untidy and almost always inconvenient. But making room is not about my own comfort. It’s about taking something I presume is mine and offering it to someone else. \n\nJesus made room for everyone, for all types of people—neighbors, the poor, His betrayers, strangers, children, and so many more. It was a mark of His ministry: giving Himself and offering Himself to others and to the Father. Jesus made room because His is a gospel for all people. The apostle Paul writes, “ For those of you who were baptized into Christ have been clothed with Christ. There is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male and female; since you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:27–28). In the gospel, there is no “other”—there is only “us.”\n\nBy His grace, God makes us living testimonies of Christ’s life by this truth: “We love because He first loved us” (1 John 4:19). In being inconvenienced and uncomfortable and messy, we find a nearness with God, because Jesus was these things and more on our behalf. We are learning to make room for others, because while we were still sinners, room was made for us.\n\nThanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nI’m embarrassed to admit how often I don’t love my neighbor. \n\nOne of my neighbors is a man who regularly stands on a corner near my house. Pangs of guilt shoot through my heart every time I shift my eyes away from him as I pass by. I have a long list of excuses for my inaction, of course—mind tricks and rationalizations to push away the guilt. It might not be safe to interact… I might enable an addiction… I can’t make a difference anyway. But is ignoring his very existence the way of the gospel? \n\nWhen asked point-blank to identify the most important commandment, Jesus responded:\n\n“Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind,  and with all your strength. The second is, Love your neighbor as yourself.  There is no other command greater than these” (Mark 12:30–31).\n\nNotice how Jesus snuck two commandments into His answer? With this twofold response, Jesus showed just how interrelated and inseparable these two commandments really are. To truly love God, we must also love people.\n\nOn our best days, we want to obey Jesus’s command. But if we’re honest, some people are easier to love than others. Maybe they require less sacrifice, they love us back, or they just caught us in a good mood. Whatever our reasons, Jesus challenged this preference and inconsistency: “For if you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same?” (Matthew 5:46). In other words, don’t expect a gold star for only loving when it’s easy.\n\nWhen we feel guilty, we often want to justify our actions. When the Holy Spirit whispers to our conscience, we might argue away that sense of conviction by asking, Who really is my neighbor? In the book of Luke, we see a lawyer asking Jesus for clarification on the very same question (Luke 10:29). Jesus responded with the parable of the good Samaritan, a story that still offends our sensibilities, no matter how many times we hear it. Jesus told this parable to show His followers both who they should love and how they should love. The Good Samaritan and the man in the ditch had nothing in common, except for this one important detail: they were both journeying on the same road. For Jesus, that was enough of a reason to stop, to care, to be a neighbor. Anyone in our path—or on our path—is our neighbor, and we are called to love them. \n\nHow can we possibly love every person we meet? The truth is, in our own strength, we can’t—not perfectly. But the command remains. Scripture tells us that those who are in Christ are able to love because He first loved us (1 John 4:19–20). The life we live and the love we give are by His power and for His glory (Galatians 2:19–20). \n\nThe Son of God is the ultimate embodiment of the good Samaritan. Jesus left heaven to become one of us (Philippians 2:6–8), to seek us out and meet us in our deepest need, when we were still lying dead in the ditch of our sin (Ephesians 2:1). He left His throne room to rescue us, even to the point of death on a cross. Let us love our neighbors with this same otherworldly love, the love of Christ. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nWe dragged a queen-sized mattress from the guest room, which could only mean one thing: showtime. Growing up, my brother and I crafted our best gymnastics routines under the forest green glow of our bonus room. Standing in line, we’d take turns tumbling and toppling to the latest Backstreet Boys hits, the mattress catching our falls. We would practice for hours, gaining confidence with our bounding and landing. Then we’d make a phone call to the neighbor kids, inviting them to our pre-dinnertime performance.\n\nI should be the first to admit that the show was never great. These were not Olympic backflips and handsprings; we were the somersault-and-YMCA kind of kids. We’d run and flip and run and flip until the audience got bored and decided to show us they could actually do better—and they could do headstands. The thing is, I’ve never been able to do a headstand. My legs are too long and my patience too thin. “Just try it!” the neighborhood kids would say. “You can do it!” they insisted. \n\nWhen it comes to most things in life—and when we’re talking about how to serve those who are poor—Jesus asks us to do the same: Take the world’s promises and turn them upside down. That’s how you’ll see My promises. In Scripture, we look upside down to see right-side up. Let’s attempt a headstand together: \n\nThe LORD brings poverty and gives wealth; he humbles and He exalts. He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the trash heap. He seats them with noblemen and gives them a throne of honor” (1 Samuel 2:7–8).\n\nMaybe it’s the blood rushing to my head, but I’m seeing in a fresh light all the ways the Lord cares for the poor. He lifts them “from the dust” and gives them “a throne of honor” with noblemen. Do you see what I’m seeing? Not once do these verses mention money. True wealth has nothing to do with our bank accounts; it has to do with the riches of the kingdom that are ours in Christ.\n\nDoes God use money to help the poor get on their feet or provide them with a warm meal? Yes. Should we serve the poor among us by meeting their physical needs? Absolutely! Scripture tells us this is a non-negotiable (1 John 3:17). The gospel calls for us to make room for the poor in our budgets and in our homes, and to welcome them into the family of God, just as God welcomes us. Regardless of our material wealth or lack, we are all spiritually bankrupt without the lavish love and grace of God given to us in Jesus Christ. \n\nWhen we think loving the poor is too complicated—if we get bogged down in the logistics, wondering who and how and what, when it comes to our time and resources—we can go to God’s Word for clarity. In his first letter to Timothy, Paul gives us a reminder on how to see things gospel-side up:\n\nInstruct them to do what is good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and willing to share,  storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the coming age,  so that they may take hold of what is truly life (1 Timothy 6:18–19).\n\nGenerosity is more than a kind gesture; it is a lifeline that keeps us tethered to what is real, to what is eternal. When we joyfully give our resources to those in need, it reminds us that everything we have is a gift from the God who lifts us from our desperate need by His grace. May we be generous with our time, our homes, our money, as an outpouring of the room that has already been made for us in Christ. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nAs a teenager I was a pretty lousy prodigal. The youngest of three daughters, I had the benefit of watching my sisters’ rebellious moments backfire, and so I learned quickly that the best way to stay in my parents’ good graces was to toe the line. Add to that the fact that we lived at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, surrounded by structure, discipline, and people who knew how to do things right. Early on, I decided I wanted to be like them. While good leaders might make honest mistakes, they usually don’t blow a bunch of cash partying. They go to college, get good grades, and become generals and senators. \n\nI applied that same logic to my young Christian faith. I thought if I lived “rightly,” all my dreams would go just as I’d planned. I even claimed Scripture to back me up! (See Proverbs 16:3.) Instead, my self-righteousness grew like a cancer, slow and undetected, hidden by a life focused on pleasing others. \n\nThere is so much irony in self-righteousness because it is exactly the self-righteous who don’t think they have a problem. That’s why it can be a toxic sin, one that creeps into our lives without our awareness. Today, I find it most apparent in my marriage. When I’m having a bad day, God forbid my husband sneeze too loudly, miss a button on his shirt, or accidentally leave the stove on. I’m quick to point out or dwell on his minor flaws while ignoring the far bigger issue: my critical spirit.\n\nIn the parable of the prodigal son, the older brother starts a long argument with his father. He was angry and, legally speaking, he probably had a case against his younger brother. But followed to the root, his anger was really a deep-seated resentment. He tells his father, “I have been slaving many years for you” (Luke 15:29). His angry confession reveals that all along, he’d felt bitter about the work his father had asked him to do. He mentions that he’d never had a party thrown in his honor. Deep down, he felt he deserved one, along with the accolades that would surely come with it. \n\nSelf-righteousness blocks our ability to find joy in the redemption of others. When I’m being self-righteous, I’m far better at calling other people names than I am at naming my own sin. Reading the parable of the prodigal son has never been fun for me because I know I’m the older brother—heart hardened and locked up tight—and I would much rather be the younger brother, who knows he’s in desperate need of forgiveness.\n\nIn church circles, people often talk about the father running out to meet his son. I’ve heard it told that men in that culture didn’t run; they never picked up their robes, exposing their ankles. What the father did was unabashedly and radically loving. But something I’ve never noticed before was that he didn’t stop there—he didn’t just run out to greet the son who’d been lost and gone astray. The father also sought out his self-righteous son; he looked around and noticed that his eldest was missing from the party. \n\nThere is hope in the gospel of Jesus Christ, even for self-righteous people like me. Out of His abundant love, the Father comes after us too. There is room for all of us at His table.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nThis is a true story.\n\nI invited my enemy to dinner on purpose. There was no applause or great relief or gratefulness on her part. After all, she didn’t know she was my enemy. She didn’t know the words she’d said about me had made their way back to my ears. She didn’t know how wounded I’d felt by her piercing remarks about my life, my home, my personality, and my portion. \n\nShe didn’t know God had set that table for me in the presence of my enemy. And so, she enjoyed my wine and my bread, my Brussels sprouts with bacon, my perfectly roasted pork tenderloin, and my chocolate brownies, still gooey from the oven and topped with a small dollop of ice cream. She ate it all up and still left my enemy. Months later, more of her words made their way back to me, and I planned another dinner, determined to win her affections, her heart, her repentance, or at least the absence of her criticism.\n\nThis is a true story, of sorts, but not entirely the way I’ve told it to you. The truer story is that I was the enemy and God was my ever-present and gracious host. Again and again, He laid the feast before me, knowing the wounds of words like mine. Yet He invited me back again, and again, and again. This is the God who loves us.\n\nI have often thought about the small verse that follows Peter’s first denial: “Now the servants and the officials had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold. They were standing there warming themselves, and Peter was standing with them, warming himself” (John 18:18).\n\nI think, here was Peter, denying Christ and warming himself by a fire God created. But Peter was not just denying his relationship with Christ. In a way, he was also denying Christ’s divinity. He partook of the hospitality of God in the common grace of warmth on a cold night and then left the fire as if he were God’s enemy. \n\nWe are no different. \n\nThere are books aplenty with ideas for dinner parties and table settings, inspirational images and four-course meal plans, but there is no recipe for showing hospitality to those who have cursed you, except one: the imitation of God. With unimaginable hospitality, God creates a feast, and invites all the world—His own creation—to partake of it. He does so in the face of our repeated wrongs done against Him. \n\nOur gracious God invites His enemies to warm themselves by the fire. He spreads out a table in their presence (Psalm 23:5). He rescues the oxen of those who hate Him (Exodus 23:4–5). He blesses those who curse Him (Luke 6:28)—and on and on. His hospitality knows no bounds. \n\nThe story I began with is true of me, and it’s true of you too; we were enemies of God (Romans 5:10). But the story is also true in other ways. There are those who have gossiped about me, who have slandered and cursed and wronged me. Yet God invites me to imitate Him. The world says to stop offering grace, to withhold good until it’s deserved. But the gospel saves the best wine for last, and it sets an even finer spread than each and every time before. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThe first day I met Gus, he screamed at me. I had lived a quiet life up until that point, and I had never heard screaming like this before. I myself have screamed at swim meets, at being tickled, while riding on roller coasters—but never like this. Gus’s screams terrified me. His eyes were far away and unreasoning. It was like all the unknown in him rushed out of his mouth and straight at me. I wanted to run away from him and back to my quiet life. But I couldn’t run because Gus was going to be my son, and the paperwork was already at the Embassy in Ethiopia. What was I going to do—chicken out because he’s loud?\n\nIf we were together and you cared to hear, I would tell you about our adoption of two baby boys from Africa, and how they scared the curse words out of me. (They still scare the horse apples out of me sometimes.) And I would tell you that God has been so gracious and redemptive in our lives. But that’s a long story. So let’s just talk about loving people we are afraid to love, people who maybe scare us because they come from a different place. Honestly, it scares me to love people who are not like me, but it turns out, gospel love isn’t about me anyway. It’s about Jesus and how He loves.\n\nHospitality is uncomfortable. There are people who make me want to run. To a certain degree, we all like a quiet, settled life. I mean, it’s easier to remain comfy and contented with the people we’re used to, rather than to engage with those we don’t know anything about. It can feel awkward, even risky, reaching out to people who are different, whose lives seem so dissimilar to our own. \n\nThis is the heart of hospitality: finding people on the margins and bringing them in. Remember in Psalm 68, David praises the Lord because He “provides homes for those who are deserted” (v.6). “He defends the rights of the fatherless” (Isaiah 1:17). But this hospitality extends well beyond adoption or caring for widows. God has given us so many ways to reach out to the solitary, those who’ve been deserted.\n\nThe first step to hospitality is one of obedience: we must bring people in. This obedience helps us form soup kitchens, deliver casseroles, care for widows and orphans, and welcome people into our homes. But this is only the first step. Because once we have invited people in, we are called to love them the way Christ loved us. \n\nIn the book of Zephaniah we see this exquisite mystery:\n\nThe LORD your God is among you, a warrior who saves. He will rejoice over you with gladness. He will be quiet in his love. He will delight in you with singing (Zephaniah 3:17).\n\nOur heavenly Father rejoices over us with singing! And because we are called to imitate Christ, we can’t just stop at going through the motions and serving folks soup once a year or when convenient. We are called to rejoice over others with singing; to love them. \n\nMaking this jump on our own is impossible. The only way to change our hearts is to submit them to Christ. Pray with me today that God would teach us hospitality toward widows and orphans and all those on the margins—and not only hospitality, but love.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nMy husband and I moved into a new house last summer—well, a new house to us, at least. In fact, it is a very old house, full of drafty windows and narrow stairs, but all those quirks were glossed over with stainless steel appliances, fresh paint, and marble countertops. For us, part of the appeal was extra space to share, but we had no idea how quickly the need would arise. \n\nWe hadn’t finished unpacking when we learned that a missionary family from Spain needed a place to live for a month. Not knowing who they were or how much English they spoke, we agreed, then hurried to set up a bed and buy some extra towels for the guest bathroom. \n\nThe couple arrived a few days later with their 18-month-old son, who had bright blonde hair and a gap-toothed grin. I had only a few semesters of high school Spanish under my belt, but after just a few days, through smiles and hugs and the heavy use of words like gracias, Rebecca and I had become fast friends. We communicated with a mix of Spanglish and charades, soon sharing some of our deepest heartaches and joys, even though we only had the shared vocabulary of kindergarteners. It’s amazing the connection God can forge between strangers. \n\nI love that we serve a God who shows no favoritism (Romans 2:11). In a society where women were ostracized, Jesus frequently addressed women directly, talking to them about their most intimate fears and sins. He had no concern for His own reputation. He saw no difference between rich and poor, able-bodied and lame. Jesus made room for everyone. This makes me wonder, Is it possible that there is no such thing as a stranger? Is it possible that all the boundaries we draw are invisible? Is it possible that the lines of language and skin color and difference are passing away? \n\nIt was fun and exciting to welcome a family from Spain into our home. But as I read these verses of Scripture, I’m struck by how much harder it is for me to welcome in those “close” strangers who are a regular part of my life. The sister-in-law who doesn’t quite fit in. The mother who doesn’t live up to my needs or expectations. Sometimes emotional boundary lines are harder to cross than oceans. Yet, God is with us as we welcome those strangers too. He blesses our feeble efforts. He is with us when our patience wears out. He repairs the damage of lost years, and He quiets us with His love. \n\nAs Christians, it can be easy to isolate ourselves from the world. But God has shown us that this world is not our home. We, too, are foreigners in a strange land, living here only for a short while before passing on to our permanent address with the Lord. \n\nWe, of all people, can afford to open our homes to the stranger, the ostracized, the forgotten. “For our momentary light affliction is producing for us an absolutely incomparable eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:17).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\n“Mama, I feel like I’m upside down in a cornfield!” \n\nMaybe this is something commonly heard in motherhood, but since I’ve yet to become a mother, I wouldn’t know. Hopefully, you’re just as confused as I was when I woke up to this statement in the middle of the night. I rubbed my eyes in confusion, as it took a minute to regain my bearings and remember exactly where I was—at the beach, with one of my best friends and her three children. \n\nIt was their annual beach vacation, and I’d said yes last-minute to hopping in the minivan for a few days of saltwater and sunshine before the rest of the family arrived. I didn’t have to be a mother to know that a seven-hour road trip with three kids is some kind of miracle. Ours was completed with only one short episode of crying and one small snack-spilling incident. Victorious, we’d tossed aside our sandals and rolled up our jeans at the first sight of ocean. We splashed around in the dark until we could barely keep our eyes open. \n\nOur cozy hotel room was filled with baby snuggles and loud giggles. It was a world away from my quiet apartment at home, and I loved making room for every sweet moment. I was letting the little children come to me and received cuteness and cuddles—a serious benefit—in return. But upon waking up in the middle of the night, the scene was a little different.\n\nA flipped lightswitch signaled that the “upside down in a cornfield” child was awake and not dreaming. Her tiny whimper and the worried look on her mama’s face confirmed the girl’s sudden sickness and strange hallucination. Their hurried footsteps headed for the bathroom, where baby brother’s travel crib was still blocking the toilet. That’s when I remembered that I’d been sharing a water bottle with the sweet, sickly child all day long, which meant I was probably halfway to a “cornfield” myself. \n\nSmall things sometimes turn out to be the most significant and, well, contagious—especially when they have hearts that beat like yours and mine. Making room for children is hard because we never stop being children ourselves. We never stop needing our Father. We struggle to make room even for ourselves, only to see that He already has, again and again. \n\nThis is why it’s important to make room for the children tugging on our shirts and hanging on our legs even—especially—if they aren’t living in our homes. The parent-child relationship is one of the most prevalent themes in Scripture. Shouldn’t it be one of the most prevalent themes in our lives? We should care for these little ones Jesus loves so dearly. Even when it means getting messy. Even when it means waking up in the middle of the night. Even when it means being upside down in a cornfield. \n\nIsn’t that what He does for us? God knew us when we were formless (Psalm 139:16). He prepared praise from our mouths as infants (Matthew 21:16). He asks us simply to come to Him (Matthew 19:14). May we do the same for others, especially when they are small, for they are not small to Him. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nNow the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul,  and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own,  but they had everything in common (Acts 4:32).\n\nThis verse sure feels warm and fuzzy. It’s easy to romanticize the friendships in the early church. But the reality of our own relationships surely lifts the veil. What is true for us must also have been true for them: authentic community takes work. \n\nMind if I make a confession? I spent most of my adult life trying to live without intimate Christian friendship. It was too uncomfortable for me, too messy. The investment didn’t seem to match the payout. But living life outside the circle was like being a fish in a bowl: I could survive, but I sure didn’t thrive. My patient, loving, imperfect friends have pulled me out into deeper waters again and again. \n\nI used to think this verse from Acts 4 meant the church shared all their “stuff.” Maybe they rotated the ancient equivalent of lawn mowers and weed eaters, or pooled their money to get a better rate at the fish market. There may have been an element of that, but I’m now convinced they had more than stuff in common. \n\nThey shared their gifts, recognizing that spiritual gifts are given by God “for the common good” (1 Corinthians 12:4–11). \n\nThey shared the hope of glory, recognizing that we’ve been adopted into the same family by the will of the Father (Romans 8:15–17). \n\nThey shared a calling, recognizing that we can spend our lives building little, individual kingdoms, destined to pass away, or we can join forces to join God in working on the only kingdom promised to stand forever (2 Samuel 7:16). \n\nIf the church in Acts was anything like my community of friends, the people there shared their burdens too. When the weight of hurt or disappointment or rejection becomes too heavy for one of us to carry, we lay it down, knowing someone else in the circle will pick it up. \n\nJust this week, I was hauling a load of heartache so big I worried it might bury me. My friends stepped in and said, “Let us carry this with you.” My circumstances didn’t change, my heart didn’t instantly mend, but I could stand up straight again. When life knocked me down, these friends picked me up. This, too, is a picture of hospitality. The way we in the Church respond to each other in the toughest of times shoots up a flare. It tells a watching world that we are broken and busy people, eternally bound together with the unbreakable chord of Christ’s love. “By this everyone will know that we are [His] disciples, if [we] love one another” (John 13:35).\n\nYes, hospitality is worth extending because of the benefits it affords us, but there’s a bigger story being told. Jesus knows we’re His disciples based on the evidence found in our hearts. The world knows we’re His disciples based on the evidence found in our homes. It doesn’t matter if our houses are big enough, if our floors are clean enough, if our cooking skills are accomplished enough—we should show hospitality anyway. Our hearts and lives are messy. But when we open our doors and our arms, we’re telling the story of Christ’s love.\n\nIf you’re living in a fishbowl, gulping and gasping for air, allow hospitality to pull you into deeper waters. Because it’s not just about gathering; it’s about giving. It’s not about neat and tidy; it’s about the poor and needy. It’s not about you. It’s about Christ and His Church. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Making Room for the Lost Cause",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\n“Everybody, even the worst stinker on earth, is somebody for whom Christ died.”  – Robert Farrar Capon\n\nI know so many stinkers. I bet you do too. The question of what to do about someone who seems like a lost cause is, frankly, often on my mind. I knew some real stinkers even when I was in middle school, and during those years I was very committed to reading The Lord of the Rings. All those years ago, dressed in my mithril shirt, clutching my sword of Gondor, and nibbling on lembas bread, I discovered the stinker to beat them all: Gollum. \n\nOriginally, he was just a normal hobbit, until he fell into some bad circumstances (found a dangerous object) and made some bad choices (murdered his cousin) that conspired to turn him into the wretched creature we all know as Gollum. Most of the “lost causes” I know got that way because of similar reasons: an unfortunate combination of bad choices and bad circumstances. \n\nThat instinct to be free of a “lost cause” is something many of us share, although we aren’t inclined to admit it. But, man, remember how Saul persecuted the church, and stood by, complicit, at the stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:54–66)? God picked Saul up, turned him around one hundred and eighty degrees, and sent him in the other direction with instructions to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God (Acts 9:20). God wasn’t done with Saul; He had a whole new life in store for him as Paul, follower of Jesus.\n\nThe story of Zacchaeus is similar, though instead of being a zealous Pharisee, Zacchaeus was a rich and “sinful” man (Luke 19:1–2,7). But like Paul, Zacchaeus repented when he met Christ (Luke 19:5–6). Both Paul and Zacchaeus turned from their old way of life, not because they sought Christ on their own, but because they were called to Him. The change in their lives didn’t happen because they were fed up with life and focused all their gumption toward making themselves better human beings. It was God who called them to Himself.\n\nIf you are a Christian today, it’s not because you are a better or more disciplined person than your “lost cause.” It is because of “the One who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9). He calls us. He changes us. It is He who makes the difference in the lives of the broken, the stubborn, the sneaky, the exhausting, the terrifying, and the unlovely. \n\nWhat do we do in the meantime? If it’s all up to God, does that get me off the hook? I would be so happy to go back to my second breakfast and let God deal with His own invitations to stinkers. Jonah definitely felt the same way: Good riddance, Nineveh, you bunch of eye-gougers! (Jonah 3:1–3; 4:1–3, my summation and paraphrase). Then God had to call both Jonah and Nineveh to obedience; He called Nineveh to repent and Jonah to deliver His message of repentance.\n\nAnd there it is. God does the calling. God does the changing. We are called to pray and walk in obedience, even if our steps are slow. \n\nWe don’t know the exact end of the story. In spite of how much I wanted Gollum to be shoved off a cliff and go away already, at the end of The Lord of the Rings, he was necessary to save the whole world. Even the most seemingly hopeless case may still have a part to play. The gospel urges us not to give up, but instead to hope continually in quiet obedience.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Our Need for Home",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nI’ve lived in 17 different homes during my 32 years of life, counting every dorm room and short-term apartment. From a young age, I’ve attempted to nest in each one. In eighth grade, I painted my room lime green. In college, I carefully picked out every accessory for my dorm room. In my adult life I’ve nested hard, spending weeks and months picking out furniture, arranging and rearranging gallery walls until everything was just right. It’s not that I’m a brilliant interior decorator (lime green, remember?); I just want each place I live in to feel like a home.\n\nWe may express it differently, but we all long for home. We have an innate desire to be where we belong—or to belong where we are. I wonder if this longing can be traced back to Adam and Eve when they lost their home, banished from the Garden of Eden for good.\n\nFor their entire existence, Adam and Eve had operated one way within in the garden. Naked and free, they had no shame or fear. They were at one with God. Then in a moment, everything changed, and “the eyes of both of them were opened” (Genesis 3:7). Suddenly, Adam and Eve were aware of their nakedness. They were afraid of God and ashamed to be seen by Him. When they left the garden that day, they lost more than their home; they lost themselves too.\n\nI wonder if at the root of our desire to know where we belong is the desire to know who we are. Not only do we crave a return to Eden, but a return to who we were within Eden: unashamed, free, in communion with our God. Now we are as David laments, “guilty when I was born… sinful when my mother conceived me” (Psalm 51:5).\n\nWe have an opportunity during this Easter season to grieve the loss of Eden and the loss of innocence. We can sit and contemplate our desire for home and belonging, place and identity. We do so with pain and sadness, but also with expectancy and hope.\n\nIn our quests for home, we need look no further than what we celebrate during Easter—an empty tomb. That is where our identities changed from sinful to righteous, from banished to welcome. When I know who I am in Christ, I always know where I belong. I always know where home is—in Him.\n\nSo this season we grieve and we celebrate. We are banished no more, guilty no more. We are ashamed no more because of Christ, the cross, and a tomb that lay empty. Let’s rejoice in Christ, the joy of our salvation. And let us give thanks to God who has revealed “the path of life to me,” the path leading home (Psalm 16:11).\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nBack in college, I was still of the mindset that if I behaved and performed well, God would reward me accordingly. And because I did the “right” things and got good grades, I assumed my post-college life would be smooth sailing. I expected that once graduation rolled around, I’d have a big plan—a big job—something I could tell people that would make their eyebrows go up an inch, showing that they were impressed.\n\nBut by March of my senior year, with just a couple months until the end of the semester and graduation looming, I still had no plans. The country was facing a recession. I had no job. No prospects. And I was angry at God, frustrated that I had no direction for the future, and convinced He had forgotten me. Slowly, my heart began to rebel against God, growing cold and guarded. I didn’t believe He cared about me, and so I withdrew from Him. In anger, I did all the things I knew in my heart weren’t His best for me. I would call them mistakes, except my actions were entirely intentional. I ran directly toward sin, only to end up feeling burned and ashamed.\n\nThe good news of Christ is so good because the bad news is so bad. And what’s the bad news? Not much has changed since the time of Noah. In Mark 7:21, Jesus told a crowd that what defiles a person isn’t from the outside, but what comes from the heart. All you have to do is turn on the news to see that evil still reigns in this world. But the worst of us comes from within. I have extreme memories that remind me of my wayward heart. I also have daily decisions, moments when I put aside my devotion to Christ and serve my whims, appetites, and desires.\n\nMy heart is a place of longing, doubt, and restlessness. I seek out quick comfort and distraction long before I seek God’s counsel and righteousness. I need a Savior, not to save me from sin out there. I need a Savior to save me from myself. The flood isn’t the world of other people. The most dangerous flood is the faithlessness of my heart. I need an ark. A hiding place. A safe haven from the deluge of my own desire and rebellion that would take me far from God.\n\nGod has given me such a Savior.\n\nThere is nothing I can do to remove His love from me. The door to the ark is always open. The covenant will not change. The destruction I deserve is not coming for me. “Though the mountains move and the hills shake, [His] love will not be removed from [us]” (Isaiah 54:10).\n\nThe good news is so good: Jesus is far better than any wooden boat that spares my life from external destruction. Jesus provides shelter and safety when the floodwaters of my own disobedience have risen too high for me to see. He takes me up in His arms and tells me there is no condemnation. Nothing can separate me from His love. Not even me.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThe binding of Isaac breaks my heart every time I read it. I subconsciously swap myself for Abraham and replace Isaac with my beloved firstborn son, and suddenly the story hurts in a real and visceral way. (Did you do this when you read the passage?) Each physical hurdle becomes agonizing—the saddling of the donkey, the splitting of the wood, the long walk uphill, and finally, the binding up of a beloved boy. The whole agonizing ordeal truly begs the question: How did Abraham do it? How did he make it through all the steps up to the very point of raising a knife over his promised and beloved son?\n\nChillingly, child sacrifice has a long, established history in many cultures, including that of Mesopotamia. Abraham was from Ur (Genesis 11:31), and so he would have been familiar with the sacrifice of a child to prove devotion to a god. Similarly, the Canaanites worshipped Molech, the false god most famous for demanding child sacrifice. The idea behind the sacrifice was this: If you are willing to sacrifice the person most precious to you—and for parents, nothing could be more precious to us than our children—then you could prove your devotion to your god. Abraham had certainly encountered this kind of demand before with regard to other cultural gods.\n\nSecond, Abraham trusted God. He trusted that “I AM” was not just another Baal or Molech. Abraham believed that God was the one true God, and he cherished the profound hope that “I AM” was different. Abraham had such trust that he reasoned God would provide for a miraculous resurrection to save Isaac, if that’s what it took (Hebrews 11:19). He even told Isaac, “God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son” (Genesis 22:8).\n\nFor both these reasons, we find Abraham shuddering with a knife raised over that which is most precious to Him. And we find ourselves standing right beside him, surveying the hopelessness of our station. We are dead in our trespasses, we live under a curse, and we have no hope of satisfying the chasm of debt that we owe. Indeed, the consequence of our sin is death (Romans 6:23).\n\nWe need a God who can raise the dead (Matthew 10:8). We need a God who has the power to undo the curse (Romans 8:2). And our God has promised and proven that He can and will do both. Our God does not demand child sacrifice—He abhors it! After all, He knits together our children and treasures them because they are His very own. We don’t need a false god with a lust for flesh and a desire for pain. Rather, we worship the one true God, who preserves, protects, loves, and cherishes us and our children. Hallelujah!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nLet’s face it, when the Lord called the Israelites “stiff-necked,” He was being kind.\n\nOn their best days, they were whiney, rebellious, fearful, and contentious. And this particular day we’re reading about was definitely not one of their best. \n\nWith metal they’d pillaged from their enemies (Exodus 12:35), they fashioned a statue of a calf and convinced themselves that the idol was the Lord Himself, the one who had delivered them from slavery in Egypt. \n\nIt’s okay to shake your head. Their error was preposterous. In hindsight, I suppose it’s obvious that rebellion against a loving and sovereign God always is. No wonder God declared, “Now leave me alone, so that my anger can burn against them and I can destroy them” (32:10). \n\nThis was the nation that had seen God send plagues to torment their oppressors. These were the ones who had walked across the Red Sea on dry ground. These were God’s chosen people, those who had tasted the manna He’d rained from heaven. And still, as soon as their leader was out of earshot, they turned their adoration toward a weaker god—one who could never save them. God’s wrath was surely justified.\n\nGod is holy.  His people were unholy. \n\nHe is generous.  They were greedy. \n\nHe is faithful.  They were faithless.\n\nHe showcased His power.  They bowed before a powerless statue instead. \n\nWe’ve all bowed before the wrong altars. Who will plead our cause? We cannot shake our sin nature. Who will defend our case? We are the rebellious children of a holy, holy, holy God. Who will stay His hand?\n\nThis moment in Israel’s history allows us to peek at the glory of the gospel. In pleading with the Lord to spare the Israelites, Moses was pointing forward to Christ, who right now—right this very minute—is our advocate, standing between our sin and the punishment we rightly deserve (Romans 8:34). We remain God’s beloved, yet rebellious, children—our hearts ever turning toward all that glitters. Even so, God’s wrath is stayed because there is One who pleads for us even now. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nAs an undergrad, I studied political science and economics, and spent more hours than I can count learning, arguing, unlearning, and repositioning my political compass. But after four years of study, it was clear to me that there is no perfect form of government, no flawless ideology or leader. \n\nAnd yet, I find myself wrapped up in the political whirlwind even now. I think, But what if the promises are true? What if this person really can make a difference? What if she or he will make my life easier, my money stretch farther, my kids safer? \n\nIt is easy to fall into the same trap as the Israelites oh-so long ago. When things get tough, personally or globally, the lure of a strong leader is hard to resist. They must have thought, What if we had a king to protect us from our enemies? What if we had someone who could make us into a strong nation?\n\nGod gave Israel a king: first Saul, then the great King David, then Solomon. Saul fought for them, David led them, and Solomon dispensed wisdom from his throne. But ultimately, these men failed, as all earthly kings do. This narrative is a rather simple one to unpack: the people asked for a king, God gave them kings, those kings failed, and then God promised to send them the real King, all of which is true, of course. \n\nBut our need for a king goes back further than Solomon, David, and Saul. It goes back to the garden, when Adam and Eve walked with God and the serpent tempted them with power. Because isn’t that the root of our desire for a king? Power. Power over our enemies, our circumstances, and our future. \n\nFrom the beginning, God was wiring us for a king and setting the stage for the King of kings. He called Abraham to become the father of a nation. He called Moses and His people to a land. He gave Moses a law rooted in His character, brimming with justice and righteousness. He sent judges to call His people back to Him, to remind them of the boundaries the law provided. And then He gave them earthly kings, men whose résumés were filled with both successes and failures but who, ultimately, could never be the King the people truly needed. \n\nIn Jeremiah, during the cycle of mostly terrible kings, the prophet wrote on behalf of the Lord: “I will raise up a Righteous Branch… He will reign wisely as king and administer justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. This is the name he will be called: The LORD Is Our Righteousness” (23:5–6). \n\nThis was the promise, but also the deep desire, God had sown into the hearts of His people. The pieces were there: a people, a land, a just law. But the King was missing, and one day, the King would come. \n\n",

Today the spring sun was especially bright, causing me to squint my eyes as the light poured through my driver’s side window. A dense layer of fog covered the water as far as I could see. Gulls danced in and out of the cloud-like mist, some resting still and peaceful on the glassy surface. The sun, the fog, the gulls, the water—the combination stunned me, caught that deep sigh in my chest and held it there a minute. \n\nIt was the second day in a row the lake looked exactly like this, and both times it brought worship to my lips:\n\nI praise you, Lord, for you are the Creator God, the maker of the water and the birds, the sun and the mist, and the breath in my lungs. You are God, you are Lord, and I give you all of me today. \n\nThere was no analyzing my prayer outline or word choice, no time for false pretense or doubt. I’d seen a glimpse of the glory of the Lord, and immediate, unhindered praise felt like the only possible response.\n\nSpontaneous worship sessions are not new to our Almighty God. Since the making of mankind and the dawn of creation, people and nature have praised Him. On this day recorded in Matthew 21, Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey, and another chorus of praise erupted: \n\nHosanna to the Son of David!Blessed is he who comes in the nameof the Lord!Hosanna in the highest heaven! (v. 9). \n\nAs Luke’s Gospel tells it, “the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen” (Luke 19:37). Miracles—plural. Many of them. These people who had been following Jesus had seen evidence that this was not just a man. This man was the Son of God. They had seen glimpses of His glory, and it led them to worship.\n\nLuke also records that as Jesus rode on toward the gates of Jerusalem that day—toward the death due every single human but Him—He also wept for its brokenness. He cried for those who did not recognize the Messiah in their midst (Luke 19:44). \n\nThe Savior had come, but they did not know Him.\n\nAs we enter Holy Week on this Palm Sunday, may we see Jesus for who He is. May we read with clear eyes and open hearts the Gospel account of these days and events that are the foundation of our faith. And may we worship the One at the center of it all.\n\nBlessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is Jesus, who comes to save us.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Our Savior Is Anointed",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nIn today’s reading, Christ is anointed in both word and deed. First, we read about the children in the temple who declare, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” (Matthew 21:15). And then there is the woman in Bethany who anoints Jesus physically, breaking open a jar of perfume and pouring it out on His head (Mark 14:3). Both are beautiful examples of exulting Christ both with our words and with our actions, though not everybody in the story is happy.\n\nScripture describes the chief priests and scribes as indignant after hearing children call Jesus “Son of David,” a title reserved for the Messiah. And after the woman anoints Christ with perfume, the onlookers are described in the same way—indignant—asking, “Why has this perfume been wasted?” (v.4).\n\nThe anointing of Christ was an offense and a disruption. For the chief priests and scribes, it represented a disruption to their hierarchy, placing this man Jesus at the top. For those watching the woman spend her most expensive perfume, the anointing seemed irresponsible: Why waste such a precious possession? Additionally, as members of two marginalized and powerless demographics in first-century Judea, a woman and a group of children would not have had the authority to make such claims about a man. The anointing of Christ grated against an otherwise ordered and reasonable existence.\n\nBut did Jesus come to ensure a reasonable and ordered existence for us all?\n\nWhen the woman anoints Jesus, He says she is foreshadowing an even greater disruption to society as they knew it. Jesus’s death, burial, and resurrection were about to turn humanity upside-down. The greatest societal disruption of all was still to come, one in which the unclean would be clean and the unrighteous made righteous. \n\nIf I’m honest, I can be resistant to the Jesus who disrupts my order in the same way He disrupted the temple and the town of Bethany. I can grow very comfortable in the world I’ve created for myself and my place in it. The anointing of Christ, as well as the way He was anointed, tell me my purpose is not to be complacent with the way things are. I am to anoint Christ in word and in deed, following my King and doing His work, even if it pushes social boundaries, even if it prioritizes the wellbeing of the marginalized over my own comfort. This is the work that acts out real love toward one another, not because we are so good at loving, but because we have been so loved.\n\nThis is my prayer for us today, that our hearts would be set on the anointed Christ. I pray that the sacrificial love we have been shown and given would propel us to love others, so that one day Jesus will look at us and say, “She has done a noble thing for me” (v.6).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nMy mother sat in the passenger seat, and I was behind the wheel. My eyes glanced at the clock on the dash. Up ahead, a train inched along the track, cutting us off from the road we needed to take. People made reservations a month in advance to get a seat at this restaurant. I knew if we were too late, we’d lose our seats. I couldn’t wait any longer.\n\nWhipping the car around, I turned onto a side road and tried to find my way to the restaurant by an alternate route. But as I veered to the left, I forgot to check my blind spot. A truck barreled into the back of my car with a loud crunch. We weren’t going fast. No one was hurt. But it was most definitely my fault. I was in such a rush to get to dinner that I put our lives in danger. Thirty minutes later, we made it to the restaurant, and the hostess didn’t even mention the fact that we were late.\n\nWhen I feel the pinch of time, I rush. Jesus doesn’t. \n\nWhile reading today’s passages, I was struck by how slow and purposeful Jesus is with His disciples in their final hours together before His arrest. From the beginning of John 13, we’re told Jesus knew it was the end. He knew exactly what was coming. He even knew that Judas would be the one to deliver the deadly kiss. And yet, He doesn’t get up and start rushing around. He doesn’t point fingers or hatch an escape plan. He doesn’t open the Scriptures and start teaching frantically. He doesn’t even complete a few extra miracles, just for good measure. \n\nIn less than twenty-four hours, Jesus would be hanging on a tree, yet He stops to fill a basin with water. \n\nIn this moment, Jesus had no agenda to complete before He died, other than to show His disciples love. Putting His own fear aside, He focused solely on the words, actions, and encouragement His brothers needed to hear before He departed. Jesus knelt, took foul-smelling feet in His hands, and wiped them completely clean. (We live in a culture that is dying of thirst for this kind of selfless, slow, real love.) \n\nIn His last meal on earth, Jesus is my example. He shows me that I do not need to rush. I do not need to check items off my bucket list. I don’t even have to leave the room to do His work. All I have to do is love the people at my particular table. He teaches me that loving well doesn’t always mean teaching—it also means doing. Love means washing feet. It means embracing the foul parts of life. It means listening attentively to my friends and breaking bread, being still, even when every instinct of my heart tells me to run because we’re running out of time. \n\nThere is no need to rush when God is in control. If my Lord and Savior rested in this truth and served in this way, then He will surely help me do the same (John 13:14–15). Regardless of what appears to be blocking my path or barreling toward me in this life, I can be still and rest in Him. I can speak kindly to those around me. I can serve right now, right where I am. \n\nDear Lord, give me the strength to fill basins.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThe summer I was seventeen, I spent a few weeks house sitting for family friends. The house was beautiful, the owners had cable, and I got to have full independence so, let’s be honest, they were doing me the favor. I was working down the road at a country club in the esteemed dual position of waitress and lifeguard, and after work, sometimes the cool kids wanted to come hang at my house. I definitely did not have permission to bring lifeguards and bartenders back to the house, but I was intoxicated with the independence that only real estate can bring. When the homeowners returned, they found a picture frame upstairs that someone had accidentally broken, and every once in a while, I still feel a little prick of embarrassment due to my betrayal.\n\nI had one job. But instead of doing it perfectly and responsibly, I did an okay job with a little betrayal along the way. I had watered the plants but failed to protect the house. We like to think that we are so close to getting it just right every time, but then some external factor seems to hold us back from pitching that perfect game. (If only I hadn’t been so young and naive! If only I’d had more time. If only I weren’t so tired.)\n\nWhat if Judas felt the same way? He was so close to being a great disciple, but he missed the mark because the lure of silver proved too strong. When Judas joined the inner circle, he didn’t do it just so he could betray their leader. \n\nCertainly the rest of the disciples intended to do a great job of following Jesus. Peter, James, and John wanted to stay awake and wait with Christ while He prayed in the garden. But then they grew tired, their eyes heavy, and every single one of them gave in to sleep.\n\nIf anyone could come close to showing us an example of perfect righteousness and devotion, surely it would have been Peter; he’s “the rock,” after all (Matthew 16:18). Peter strenuously insisted that he would never make the mistake of betraying Christ, but even his very best intentions were garbage by the time the rooster crowed. If even Peter betrayed Christ in His hour of need, where does that leave us?\n\nIs it really just external hindrances holding us back, or is it possible that we don’t even understand how desperately we need the gospel? None of our righteousness—even our shiniest stuff—is sufficient. We all have Judas hearts, and even our best intentions are filthy rags. Our betrayals show us that, in big and small ways, our selfish interests are so strong we can’t resist those silver coins or those teenage lifeguards. We are all capable of deep betrayal.\n\nWhen Judas arrives in the garden to betray Him, Jesus asks, “Friend,… why have you come?” (Matthew 26:50). And He asks us the same question: Why have we come? We come out of our desperate need for a Redeemer. We come with ash smeared on our faces. \n\nWhether we feel like Judas or like Peter, we need Christ’s grace exactly the same. Even in our betrayals, Christ reaches out to His people with mercy. We are to come for this alone: Christ. We are to come for His perfect righteousness, leaning wholly upon Him, for He is the Messiah, the Son of God, and is now seated at the right hand of Power, and will come again in glory.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nI know the events of Holy Week unfolded more than two thousand years ago. I wasn’t there, and yet, as I prepare my heart for Easter morning, I keep bumping into reflections of myself in the text. \n\nHere I am in John 18: \n\nI am the Jews who escorted Jesus to Pilate. They thought they were righteous because they stayed in the front yard, yet convinced themselves their hands weren’t dirty as they handed over an innocent man for the slaughter. How often do I rely on all manner of rules to make me “clean” while willfully rebelling against a holy God? How often is my heart soiled by sin that I ignore because I’ve stuck to some arbitrary list of dos and don’ts?\n\nI am Pilate. I want to wash my hands of the matter of sin and suffering. Don’t you? Don’t we all? How often do I utter, “What is truth?” when the truth is inconvenient to me? The answer, I’m afraid, is all too often.\n\nLook, there I am in Luke 23: \n\nI am the crowds, offended by the ways Jesus interrupts the status quo and upends my paradigms. As He strips me of my comfort and convicts me of my obsession with self, my heart becomes indignant. I want to yell, scream, and stomp my feet.\n\nI am Herod. I am willing to use Jesus to suit my purposes, to elevate my own power. \n\nI see myself most clearly in Matthew 27:\n\nI am Barabbas. There’s no use in trying to deny it. I am a sinner, guilty of violating the holy law of God. Barabbas was a “notorious prisoner” of the Roman government. Without Christ, I am a prisoner to my sin. I deserve whatever punishment God could hurl at me, but He takes my place instead. Because of Him, I walk in undeserved freedom. \n\nFriend, I know you are these things too. We all are. \n\nWe are prone to value rules over righteousness. We are capable of distancing ourselves from inconvenient truth. We are irritated by the ways that following Christ can stir up trouble for us in this world, yet more than okay with using Him to elevate ourselves in the eyes of other believers. We are guilty of sin—undeniably so—and are so often imprisoned because of it. And we are as responsible for sending Jesus to the cross as the crowds who yelled, “Crucify him!”\n\nBut there is none like Him. Amen? His grace and mercy transcend time and geography. His actions on Holy Week have the power to save us just as much as they have the power to save the ones who lined the streets to see Him punished. Go on, see yourself in the story. Feel the sting of your sin. But let your eyes move quickly to Jesus, who willingly took our place so that we might be a people who walk in undeserved freedom. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nThis is it. \n\nThis is the question and answer, the moment, the hinge upon which all of history sits. \n\nDid Jesus, fully man and fully God, die on the cross, not just as a Jewish rebel and teacher in ancient Rome, but as the promised Messiah and Savior of all humanity? Did He?\n\nDo you believe it? \n\nDo I?\n\nI have a very vivid memory of standing in the emerald-green-tiled shower of our charmingly dilapidated St. Louis apartment, a year and a half into seminary, water washing over me and tears rushing down my face. I asked myself, “Do you really believe this is true? Do you?” The questions, the concepts, and the reordering of my heart and mind were almost too much. \n\nI have an equally vivid memory of driving to Target the afternoon our little friend-family experienced unspeakable tragedy, and of whisper-screaming with every breath I took, saying, “Jesus, be real. Jesus, BE REAL. Jesus, please be real.”  \n\nI have just as many if not more moments of deep assurance, of knowing Christ to be true. I resonate with John Wesley’s words describing his own faith: “I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.”\n\nAll this makes me wonder, reflecting on today’s Scripture, how many people who were there at Christ’s crucifixion found themselves feeling the terror of unbelief? And who felt the sweet, blessed assurance of faith? What would it have been like to be a witness to this moment, to believe that all the promises of the ages were coming true? Or to be a blind witness, without faith, and to feel nothing more for Jesus than for the criminals who hung next to Him? \n\nThe terror of unbelief settled on Peter, who denied Jesus three times. Disbelief motivated the scoffing Jewish leaders, and the insulting criminal on the cross. It led Pilate to apathy.\n\nBut the repentant thief on the cross next to Jesus believed. The centurion gasped at the sudden darkness and knew this was not just another prisoner hanging nearby. \n\nJoseph and Nicodemus believed, and acted in faith to care for the broken body of the Son of God. Chapters earlier we read that Nicodemus, a pharisee, wasn’t sure if he believed in Jesus; but in today’s reading, we suddenly find him doing the humiliating work of preparing the Lord’s dead body for burial—work typically reserved for women and slaves. Nicodemus knew it was all true.\n\nThis is it. And it is all true. \n\nIt is true on the days I am blindsided by the terror of unbelief. And it is true on the days I feel it doubtlessly in every bone and blood cell in my body. \n\nMy Good Friday prayer, in this between-Friday-and-Sunday life that we live, is that I will always remember and proclaim, “Truly, this man is the Son of God” (Matthew 27:54). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nAs a serial doubter, I have always loved the resurrection story and its honest portrayal of who was quick to believe Jesus was the risen Christ and who was more skeptical. Historically, I have been more like Thomas, wanting proof and evidence: “If I don’t see the mark of the nails in his hands, put my finger into the mark, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe” (John 20:25).\n\nMary Magdalene’s reaction to the risen Christ differed from that of Thomas. She believed as soon as Jesus spoke her name. “Rabboni!” she cried in recognition (v.16). And later when she saw the disciples, she said with confidence, “I have seen the Lord!” (v.18).\n\nThomas trusted Jesus’s scars. Mary trusted Jesus’s voice.\n\nIn my early twenties, I went through a dark season of doubt. Out in the real world for the first time, surrounded by people who did not believe in Christianity, much less God, I was suddenly very unsure of my own beliefs. I desperately wanted to prove God’s existence to my unbelieving friends—and to myself. So I searched for answers in apologetics, academics, and science, confident that if I could pull enough evidence together, I could believe again, and my friends would too.\n\nDuring that youthful season, it was not the hard evidence of academics and apologetics that I grew to trust and understand. Ultimately, what pulled me back to faith was this: At some point in my life I had known the risen Christ. I had felt the love of God through Him. I had experienced grace and forgiveness. I was not sure how to prove the existence of God through science, but I could not deny that I had experienced the risen Christ. I had heard Him say my name.\n\nThis is not to say investigating our faith is fruitless. After all, Jesus did not chastise Thomas for asking for proof. He gave it to him, saying, “Put your finger here and look at my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Don’t be faithless, but believe” (John 20:27). But even today, when I find myself wrestling with questions about God, the Bible, Jesus, or religion, what I return to is not the evidence I’ve gathered, proving His existence. What I remember is the fact that Jesus has touched my life, and I have seen the marks on it as a result. \n\nWhen the doubt is crippling, when the road before us is unclear, may we remember this day near the tomb. Mary Magdalene thought she had lost her friend, her teacher, her Rabbi. All was sorrow before and around her—and then, she heard Him speak her name. Have you heard Him speak yours?\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nWhat would you do if you wanted to start a revolution? If you wanted to prove that you were the most powerful person to ever walk the earth? If you wanted to prove that you had in fact just been raised from the dead? What would you do first?\n\nI think I would shoot fireworks from my fingertips. Or maybe go to the people who had tried to kill me, and show them I was alive once again. I think I’d go flying around in the sky shouting from the rooftops. \n\nThese final few verses were Luke’s last chance to convince readers that Jesus really did rise from the dead. That He really is the Son of God. As a writer, I cannot fathom a more challenging task. But Luke made a decision. He decided to stick to the facts, and the facts are mind-bogglingly simple. \n\nFirst, the women. A group of women find the empty tomb and return to their friends babbling in an excited confusion. This in itself should convince us of the veracity of this story. After all, in the first century, women were considered unreliable witnesses; their testimony wasn’t even permitted in a court of law. Tim Keller writes: “If the Christians were making up these stories to get their movement off the ground, they never would have written women into the story as the first eyewitnesses to Jesus’s empty tomb. The only possible reason for the presence of women in these accounts is that they really were present and reported what they saw.”\n\nSecond, the walk. While Peter runs to the tomb to determine if what the women said is true, Jesus goes on a walk. Oh, how I love this story! Two disciples I’ve never heard of—Cleopas and a disciple who goes unnamed—are walking and talking, processing recent events, when this stranger sidles up next to them. They recount all the events of the week: “How have you not heard about this?!” And then, still under the guise of a stranger, Jesus begins to teach from the Scriptures, starting from Genesis 1:1. Jesus loves Scripture. He knows it—He is the Word made flesh, after all (John 1:14)—and His teaching sets their hearts aflame. They have a simple meal together, and then just as quickly as He appeared to them, Jesus was gone. \n\nThen, His words. Jesus’s first resurrected words to His gathered disciples were, “Peace be with you” (John 20:21). He knows they are terrified, full of doubt. And again, His first action in their presence is not to perform a miracle, but to perform the mundane. He invites them to touch Him, to see His hands and feet. He takes a bite of fish—at face value, an act not of divine power as much as simple human digestion. He then goes on to bless them and remind them of the meaning of the Scriptures, of what’s true. There is no rush. No hurry. In other words, Jesus acts in resurrection exactly as He had in life. Nothing has changed, and yet absolutely everything has. \n\nJesus is alive! He really is. And for that reason, I can trust that the rest of my life here on earth is but a shadow of what is to come. Jesus did not hustle. He did not worry. He did not feel threatened by doubt. He simply held up His hands and said, “Here… touch.” He walked alongside His friends, and He walks with you and me, too—even if we do not recognize Him at first. \n\n“The Lord has truly been raised” (Luke 24:34), and we are not the same. So go babble excitedly like the women that first Easter morning. Run to the empty tomb like Peter. Walk at a leisurely pace with your God. Invite Him to teach you through His Word. Break bread. Take a bite of fish. Everything is different now, even the seemingly mundane. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI get hungry every time I read the Gospels. So much eating! So much cooking and drinking—the clanking of plates and the clinking of cups veritably rings off the pages! Remember when Jesus departed from the disciples to face the cross? He did so with a parting meal. When He came to them again, resurrected, He served them breakfast on the beach. It’s hard to imagine literally anything better than breakfast on the beach—two of the best things in life all at once.\n\nAt other meals, both metaphorically and with real bread, Jesus is continually feeding His sheep, because He is the Good Shepherd. He reminds us that He is the bread of life and no other food will ultimately satisfy. And when He feeds us, He is teaching us what the kingdom of heaven looks like.\n\nHis kingdom is not of this world, and man does not live by bread alone. But Christ is also the Christ of feasts. He feeds every part of us, body and soul. And when He asks Peter, “Do you love me?” He follows with this: “Feed my sheep” (John 21:17). \n\nHe asks us the same question: “Do you love me?” If so, then you also will have a heart for the flock. Others will know we are His disciples in this way, that we love one another, we feed one another, and we share with one another the true and living bread of life—as well as the bread broken together at our own dining room tables.\n\nThe beckoning call of the kingdom says, “Come, everyone who is thirsty, come to the water; and you without silver, come, buy, and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without silver and without cost!” (Isaiah 55:1). The beckoning call of Christ is this: “Come and have breakfast” (John 21:12). Both are invitations to come to Him and to His table.\n\nRobert Farrar Capon, writer and cook, understood this. In his book, The Supper of the Lamb, he says: \n\n“To be sure, food keeps us alive, but that is only its smallest and most temporary work. Its eternal purpose is to furnish our sensibilities against the day when we shall sit down at the heavenly banquet and see how gracious the Lord is. Nourishment is necessary only for a while; what we shall need forever is taste.”\n\nSince the very beginning, God has fed us, calling us to feed from Christ, from the tree of life, rather than lean upon our own understanding or depend upon the bread of Egypt (Genesis 2–3; Exodus 16:3–8). He is using food to give us a taste for the eternal. He is using food to teach us that He is good and faithful. He is using food to teach us to feed one another. At every turn, we are called to “taste and see that the LORD is good” (Psalm 34:8).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nAllow me to show you two snapshots of my life. \n\nIn the first frame, I am a new believer on a mission trip to Jamaica. Our team went door to door handing out bags of seeds and sharing the gospel with any natives who would listen, a venture that was terrifying for me. First, the idea of talking to strangers (much less strangers in a foreign country) was intimidating. Second, sharing my faith scared me so much that I lied and claimed I had the spiritual gift of intercessory prayer. While the team knocked on doors, I stood at a distance and pretended to pray. Lest you desire to give me the benefit of the doubt—don’t. I lied about spiritual gifts to get out of sharing the good news, one of many reasons I am gobsmacked by the goodness of God’s grace. \n\nSnapshot two is more recent. I was invited to speak in a remote fishing village in Alaska. I would be dropped by bush plane into a region with no phones, where I would teach a native people group who were openly hostile to the gospel. My knees still knocked. My palms were plenty sweaty. But I went and delivered the good news to anyone who would listen—and a few who didn’t want to.\n\nWhat shifted? I got a bigger view of God. \n\nHere in chapter 28, the book of Matthew comes to a close with an awe-inspiring encounter between Jesus and His disciples. It’s a moment that could have been pulled from the movie Braveheart. The disciples have already scattered in fear during Jesus’s trials. They were nowhere to be found as He was being crucified and murdered. They mourned as His body was placed in a borrowed tomb. And then… they got a bigger view of God too. They felt the earth tremble as an angel rolled the stone away. They peeked inside the empty tomb. They ran their fingers along the scars in His hands. Everything they thought they knew about Jesus expanded, because now they served a risen Savior. \n\nThat’s why, when Jesus said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me” (v.18), they knew His words were true. And when He told them to “go,” they got busy going. Believer, aren’t you glad they did?\n\nChurch, we have been commissioned to go and tell, to preach and praise, to be disciples and make disciples. And there is only one reason to do it, one truth that will get our feet unstuck: Jesus. Is. Worthy. In this Lenten season may we gain a bigger view of Him. There’s a whole world waiting for us to go and tell. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI don’t remember the first presidential inauguration I watched as a child, but I vividly remember planning to have one of my own one day—complete with an inaugural ball, naturally. Today my daughter whirls around the living room, singing the songs of Queen Elsa’s coronation day from Frozen, feeling the same flutters of imagination that I did when I watched Princess Mia crowned princess of Genovia in The Princess Diaries. \n\nWe hardly ever think of inaugurations as the end of something, but rather as the beginning. And yet, when we read about Christ’s ascension in Acts 1, it can feel like the end of His story rather than the inauguration of His kingdom. \n\nHe ascends into heaven, sits down at the right hand of the Father, and history goes on. Often, I stop there: Christ, frozen in time, seated on the throne, and waiting for His return. \n\nBut the truth is so much richer, deeper, and more beautiful than that. When Jesus ascended into heaven, He received the mantle of King over all creation.\n\nWhen Christ ascended, He did so into a cloud. Clouds are often used in Scripture to reveal God’s divine presence, from the cloud that showed the Israelites where to travel by day (Exodus 13:22), to the cloud that filled the tabernacle (Exodus 40:35), to the cloud that appeared at the transfiguration (Matthew 17:5), and the cloud upon which Jesus will descend at His second coming (Revelation 1:7).\n\nChrist’s homecoming to God in Acts 1 foreshadows our own. But the ascension is more than foreshadowing; it also inaugurated Christ’s new role as our advocate. By joining the Father at His right hand, the risen Jesus grants us access to God. On the cross, He became our substitute. At the ascension, He has become our advocate. Tim Keller writes, “When the eyes of God the Father look at you, they see the ascended Jesus; when they listen to you, they hear him.” \n\nAnother element of Christ’s Kingship on full display at the ascension was His commissioning authority. Just before He rose to join God, He commissioned His disciples to spread the gospel—not just to the Jewish people, but everyone around the whole world: to Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). Christ was claiming the whole earth as His kingdom as He rose to take His place as King. \n\nWe wait for Christ’s second coming, but today we remember the day He ascended victoriously to the right hand of the Father, inaugurating His rule as King over all His creation. We celebrate the glorious truth about His reign: \n\n“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of justice.” –Hebrews 1:8\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\n“Is He coming? Where is He?”\n\nMy daughter craned her neck, trying to see from our spot in the very last row of the very old church we sat in on Good Friday. \n\n“What?” I whispered. \n\n“Jesus! Is He here? Is that the cross? Are those His bloody clothes?” she asked, pointing to the decorative cross draped in white cloth at the front of the sanctuary. \n\nMusic started, and she returned to doodling in the bulletin. Meanwhile, I was reeling. How do I answer that? In the particularly concrete mind of a four-year-old, of course it would make sense that Jesus would be present. We remind her over and over again that Jesus is real, and He is always with us. \n\nThe jump to faith, to believing in what we have not seen, is hard to explain to her, and harder still to model. But this is the tension we hold: we believe in something we cannot see, but it is something real and present and happening right now. \n\nChrist is holding session as King over all creation. Right now. This very moment. He has since the day He ascended, and He will until the day He returns. Christ’s “session” began when He ascended into heaven to sit at the right hand of God the Father. \n\nTheologian Karl Barth wrote, “The summit has been reached, the perfect tenses lie behind us and we enter the realm of the present… Whatever prosperity or defeat may occur in our space, whatever may become and pass away, there is one constant, one thing that remains and continues, this sitting of his at the right hand of God the Father.” \n\nFrom the day Adam and Eve fell and were banished from Eden, people have been waiting for a king. David, with promised covenant kingship, knew that a greater King was coming. He wrote in Psalm 110, “The LORD declared to my Lord, ‘Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool’” (v.1).\n\nGod called together a people, first through Abraham and his descendants, and later through the apostles whom Jesus commissioned to go to the nations and invite people into the kingdom. We are now God’s people: a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, and a people for His possession. (1 Peter 2:9–10) And we are a people with a King, living by faith in the already-but-not-yet kingdom of Christ, inaugurated when He ascended to take His spot on the throne, “exalted to the right hand of God” (Acts 2:33). \n\nIn Colossians, Paul wrote that in His rescue of us, Christ has “ transferred us into the kingdom of the Son he loves” (Colossians 1:13). We, the communion of saints through the ages, live presently in the kingdom ruled by Jesus the Son, who holds His continuous session at the right hand of God. Our King holds all things together. \n\nWhen my daughter asks, “Where is He? Where is Jesus?” my answer isn’t as simple as pointing her to the front of the church. But it is an easy one: He is on His throne, seated at the right hand of God the Father, ruling His kingdom and loving His people. And our response to Him is honor, service, and faithfulness. \n\nThe sweet, sweet hymn “Fairest Lord Jesus” summarizes our posture so beautifully:\n\nFairest Lord Jesus, ruler of all nature, O thou of God and man the Son, Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor, Thou, my soul’s glory, joy, and crown. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nThe cross looms large over all of history. Its shadow is cast in all directions—forward and backward, before and behind. Every narrative in Scripture is draped in the gospel. \n\nThink back to the moment the children of Israel decided to worship a golden calf at the base of Mount Sinai (Exodus 32:1–14). God was poised to destroy them for their rebellion, and His holy wrath was fully justified.\n\nIn response, Moses turned to God, aware of how impossible it was for his people to save themselves from God’s just wrath. Unless he intervened, his beloved nation would be destroyed. In the end, the Israelites were spared, not because they were worthy or sinless (they weren’t), but because Moses pleaded for mercy on their behalf to a merciful God. \n\nAnd yet, Moses’s pleading can’t save you or me from our sin. Moses is gone, his body buried in a secret grave dug by the Lord Himself (Deuteronomy 34:5–7). Humanity’s part of God’s covenant with Moses is broken. We remain as rebellious as our Hebrew forefathers. But this is more than a story about a time when God saved a bunch of silly idol-worshippers. In the light of the cross, the image changes. True gospel hope emerges for you and for me. \n\n“These serve as a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was warned when he was about to complete the tabernacle. For God said, ‘Be careful that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.’ But Jesus has now obtained a superior ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises” (Hebrews 8:5–6, emphasis mine). \n\nChrist is our Mediator, the bridge to the better covenant. We are not—nor could we ever be—holy as He is holy (1 Peter 1:16). God’s wrath toward us is fully justified. In response, Jesus turned to face God, fully aware of how impossible it was for people to save themselves from God’s just wrath. Unless He intervened, His beloved Bride would be destroyed. \n\nAt the cross, Christ intervened for us. Yet He is not buried in a tomb. He arose with the power to keep pleading our case. Even now, this very moment, He advocates for us before the Father. He is the Savior who keeps saving us from our sin, the Mediator who keeps making our case, based on His righteousness, not our own. \n\nBeloved child of God, you have been spared. Not because you are worthy, but because Christ advocates for you. Amen. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI spent much of my twenties running a high school theatre department. We had so much fun. There are few things that bond people together like putting on a show with limited time and resources. One year we produced a spoof on Shakespeare. There was one line, shouted frantically by a young man dressed in an ornate Elizabethan dress as Juliet, that still makes me laugh: “SWEAR NOT BY THE MOON!”\n\nIn Shakespeare’s original play, Romeo and Juliet, young Juliet uses these words to warn Romeo to be careful with his vows, to not swear his love by the “inconstant moon,” which is ever-changing in its phases. Turns out Juliet’s warning is actually profound and timely advice for more folks than just Romeo.\n\nWhat we swear by is what we put our trust in, and it’s easy to misplace our trust. Maybe you don’t swear by the moon, but are you inclined to swear by your bank account, your job, your retirement plans, or your carefully scheduled week? It’s tempting to hope in things that are ultimately destined to fail, but when we try to build upon the unsteady foundation of our own whims and wistful thinking, we end up disappointed.\n\nPaul’s address to the church at Corinth, however, leaves no question about where we can lay our hope and fix our trust. He clarifies that the gospel does not fall short in any way. What is this gospel hope Paul speaks of? It is simply this: Christ was crucified for our transgressions and raised from the dead (Romans 4:25).\n\nIf Christ has not been raised from the dead, then we are much to be pitied (1 Corinthians 15:12–19). Like foolish Shakespearean moon-swearers, we have put our trust in something unreliable. How ridiculous would it be to trust in a god who dies and has no power beyond this earthly life? And so, if Christ has not been raised, then our faith in Him is as worthless as faith in the stock market or faith in the moon.\n\nBut Scripture is unequivocal: Christ has been raised from the dead. This declaration is no fool’s hope, but the sure foundation of our faith. Our faith is confirmed by fulfilled prophecy and eyewitness accounts. We can bet everything on Christ. Because “He has been raised from the dead,” we don’t have to swear by the moon or anything else. Our hope is secure in Christ’s resurrection.\n\nJesus Christ died and rose again for us. This is good news for the whole body of Christ, because “if the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole batch. And if the root is holy, so are the branches” (Romans 11:16). Because He has been raised, we who are united to Him by faith also have the guarantee of resurrection life, an everlasting and sure hope.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nCorrie Ten Boom’s memoir The Hiding Place chronicles the Nazi occupation of Holland during WWII. Under constant watch, Corrie and her family decided to form an underground network of resistance, hiding Jewish men, women, and children in homes across Holland, including their own. They knew the day would come when the Nazis would learn the truth—and soon that day came. For their crimes against Germany, Corrie and Betsey were both sent to Ravensbruck Concentration camp, where their bodies deteriorated under the weight of overwork, malnutrition, and disease.\n\nIf that were the end of the story, it would be a tragedy. But day after day, in the flea-ridden dormitory that the guards would not enter for fear of being infested themselves, Corrie and Betsey read the Bible aloud for all the imprisoned women of Bunk 28. Holding daily services, they learned that the Word of God speaks boldly, even in—perhaps especially in—the darkest circumstances. And while their health faltered, their hearts grew more convinced that they would be together with God when the ordeal was over, whether through death or through survival.\n\nOur temporary bodies hold eternal souls. My body is susceptible to illness, breakdown, injury, paralysis, and even death. But my soul is eternal. My body might stop working all together; organs might fail, and my womb may never function as it was designed to function. That is okay with me. Because my body is not me. It is a temporary home for God to do His work in the world. Even if that work is in a place I do not recognize. Even if that work is in a concentration camp. \n\nDeath—real death—is not physical. Spiritual death is eternal separation from God, and that kind of death has been swallowed up forever, because our Lord Jesus Christ took the penalty for our sin as He hung on the cross. Now, “Death has been swallowed up in victory” (1 Corinthians 15:54). So while our bodies might deteriorate, our souls will grow closer to our Creator. And one day, when Christ returns with a shout (1 Thessalonians 4:16), we will be raised to be like Him, bearing the image of heaven. “In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye… we will be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:50–52).\n\nI pray that no one will ever experience anything as cruel and inhumane as a Nazi concentration camp. But all of us will at some point experience the impact of disease, death, and disappointment on this side of eternity. Those earthly losses are deep, and our heavenly Father grieves them with us. Yet in that grief, He invites us to shift our gaze to Him, to trust that He has plans that far exceed what we can see in this world, beyond the physical realm. \n\nWhen my time comes to shed this shell, I pray that God will give me the courage to believe the truth; I lose nothing when I lose a human body, because I gain everything in Him. For the believer, Christ’s resurrection has secured eternity with Him. One day soon, He will return for us, and we will always be with Him, forevermore (1 Thessalonians 4:17). “Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!” (1 Corinthians 15:57).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nNothing reveals my inner control freak like letting a friend take over the GPS while I drive. Accustomed to seeing each upcoming turn on Google maps, I assault my passenger-navigator with questions: When is my next turn? How much longer on this road? How many miles until we’re there? I’m sure my gracious navigator wishes I would shut up and drive, trusting that we are on the right road, and she will get us to our destination safely. \n\nThomas is a bit like an angsty driver in today’s passage. Jesus holds the GPS: “I am going away to prepare a place for you” (John 14:2). But Thomas needs more details, a specific address: “‘Lord,’ Thomas said, ‘we don’t know where you’re going. How can we know the way?’” (v.5).\n\nJesus’s answer to Thomas was simply, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (v.6, emphasis added). He did not provide Thomas with a specific address, but Jesus did point to the road that would get him there.\n\nThis is a reassuring promise to a control freak like me, and it’s as much a promise for the life to come as it is for our lives today. So often I feel like I need to know my exact destination and then figure out how to get there. Where is my career headed? How do I mend this broken friendship? Where will I live when my lease is up? Jesus may not provide specific answers, but He has asked us to believe and trust in the way He’s paved for us. \n\nWhere is my career headed?  “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” \n\nHow do I mend this broken friendship?  “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” \n\nWhere will I live when my lease is up?  “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” \n\nWant to know where your life is headed? Follow the way of Jesus. Live life in the way He told us to live it. Believe in God, believe also in Christ, and you will get to where you’re supposed to go. \n\nLiving in the way of Jesus is counterintuitive for those of us who like to both drive and hold the GPS. It requires surrender. It requires us to trust our navigator. When we do this, however hard it may be, we’re able to be present on the journey without worrying about the destination.\n\nThough we cannot point to it on a map, ultimately, we know where are headed. Perhaps we don’t know how long it will take us to get there, but one thing we know for sure: Christ our Lord has prepared a place for us there, and He is coming back to receive us to Himself (v.3). For that promise, let us say, Praise be to God! \n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Lord Is My Shepherd",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nPsalm 23 speaks to my heart—green pastures, quiet waters, right paths. I am an outdoorsy person by nature. I’d much rather get lost in the woods, alone with my thoughts, the trees, and the breeze, than be in any city. So, as I read these familiar verses, I want to go outside, to be witness to the goodness and beauty of the natural world. It also occurs to me that I have something in common with sheep—we can both get lost without hardly trying.\n\nSome years ago, I read about a Merino sheep in New Zealand named Shrek. He had wandered away from his flock and his shepherd and gotten lost. For six years, he lived in nearby caves, eating what he could find and avoiding the shearer’s blade. When Shrek was finally found, his wool weighed sixty pounds, and the raw weight of twenty men’s suits on his back was threatening his life. He had trouble walking, and his breathing was labored. He needed his shepherd. So do we. \n\nShepherds take care of sheep—plural—but in this psalm, the relationship is between one sheep and his Shepherd. It’s personal, much more intimate. “The LORD is my shepherd” (v.1, emphasis mine). These words are from David, but I can’t help but read them as my own. I think we were meant to, each one of us. The Lord is my Shepherd. He guides me, provides for me, protects me from my enemies. \n\nI don’t need to worry. “I have what I need” (v.1). I don’t need to struggle or strive. “He lets me lie down in green pastures” (v.2). Weariness does not have the final say. “He renews my life.” And I won’t ever get lost. (Not really, anyway.) “He leads me along the right paths for his name’s sake” (v.3). It is only because the Shepherd is so good that I can be still and rest, that I can have true peace. \n\nI could be happy for eternity being a beloved lamb of the Good Shepherd, but Psalm 23 doesn’t leave us as sheep. A shift occurs in verse 5. David begins to address God directly—the song becomes a prayer of thanksgiving. Not only that, but the pastoral imagery is replaced by a banquet scene. You and I have become honored guests of the King. \n\nThe table is set, and though my enemies might rage just outside, none of that matters (v.5). I am in the house of my Maker, the One who knows me and loves me better than anyone else. But the best part? I’m not just a guest. I get to stay in His presence forever—”as long as I live” (v.6), though the Hebrew phrase that’s been translated doesn’t limit this time to my natural lifespan. It has all come full circle—”I have what I need,” because I have the One I was created to know and love. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nWhen I was a kid, I used to be terrified that our house was going to burn down. I would lie awake in my bed, certain that at any moment I would see smoke coming from under my door, a raging fire just down the hallway ready to engulf my entire family, destroying everything in its wake. Before bed, I would ask my parents to close all the doors (to keep the fire from getting into our rooms) and make sure the oven was off, and every so often, I’d ask them to check our smoke detectors—just in case one was malfunctioning. My parents would do all of these things, lovingly reminding me that I was safe, that nothing was going to happen to me. And they would pray with me, inviting me to bring my fears and uncertainties to God, the One who protects me and strengthens me. \n\nThis psalm refers to God as the “LORD of Armies.” This name for God appears most often in the Minor Prophets, both before and after Judah’s exile into Babylon. The lives of God’s people were full of fear and uncertainty, and they were constantly reminded of the power their enemies held over them. Referring to God as the LORD of Armies reminded them of His ability to keep them from harm. \n\nThis whole psalm is a reminder of God’s unmatched power. The psalmist writes of God’s ability to provide calm and order in the midst of total chaos. The first stanza speaks of God’s protection from the natural elements, the second of God’s protection from other nations, and the third of God’s protection from fighting and wars. In every stanza, the psalmist reminds us that God is with us—that He is our refuge, that the LORD of Armies is our stronghold. How can we not bow down in praise of such a powerful God? With a God like this on our side, fighting for us, watching over us, our fears don’t stand a chance. \n\nThese days, I’m not as scared of my house burning down as I used to be. My fears are more concerned with uncertainty about the future and my need to control things. So although I am not a nation at war, I can still find rest in the fact that the LORD of Armies is with me. He is a refuge for my weary soul, a place of comfort in the midst of chaos. His power is stronger than even the most terrifying of armies, His love deeper than any raging sea. He is strong, He is good, and He will not let me go, even in the fiercest battle.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nI grew up afraid. \n\nThunder, lightning, roller coasters, car crashes, plane crashes, tornadoes—loud, violent, terrifying scenarios that kept me up at night, or in the guidance counselor’s office at school any time it stormed. I was afraid of loud things, things that threatened to crash into my life and take away someone or something I loved. I would read Bible verses that promised me safety, plucked out of the psalms and taped on my bathroom mirror in college—-verses like these from Psalm 91: “Because you have made the LORD—my refuge, the Most High—your dwelling place, no harm will come to you” (vv.9–10).\n\nThat’s a formula I tend to like, because it gives me the perception of control; I make the Lord my “refuge,” and no harm will come to me. But many years of walking quietly in sadness with people I love have taught me there is no equation to prevent suffering. Sometimes storms enter our lives quickly like thunderclouds from the west. Sometimes they sneak in, just as the sun rises quietly in the east. But always, they come, just as they came for our Savior, Jesus Christ. When the devil tempts Jesus in the wilderness, the enemy quotes Psalm 91: “He will give his angels orders concerning you, to protect you, and they will support you with their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone” (Luke 4:10–11).\n\nIn their book, The Songs of Jesus, Tim and Kathy Keller wrote: “The devil wants us to think that God’s promises have failed if he lets us suffer. But the psalm later clarifies that God will save us ‘in trouble’ and not from it.” In other words, we do not need a refuge from the quiet, the sadness, brokenness, and pain; we need a refuge from the storm that is inevitably coming (John 16:33). Suffering was sewn into our existence at the fall, but Psalm 91 shouts into the rushing wind: \n\n“The one who lives under the protection of the Most High dwells in the shadow of the Almighty.  I will say concerning the LORD, who is my refuge and my fortress …  His faithfulness will be a protective shield” (vv.1–2,4).\n\nI am thankful for the whole of Scripture, and for the ways it quiets my soul on the hardest of days. The riches of Psalm 91 are vast, with so many metaphors and names for God, calling us backward and forward through the Old and New Testaments. It does so beautifully what the whole of Scripture does: it paints a picture of our hopeless existence apart from God, and it beckons us into the fullness of life in relationship with Him. A life that, though marked with suffering, is ultimately guaranteed and secured by the personhood and work of Jesus Christ. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nOn Saturday afternoons in autumn, one of my favorite things to do is find a hearty stew recipe, throw open the windows, and stream a great playlist of folk music. I once heard someone say that beauty will save the world. I don’t know if this is true, but I fully believe that savoring the beauty in life attunes our attention to God’s goodness. It can help alleviate the darkness pressing in around us by offering a parting of the clouds—a heightened glimpse of light and hope. I can’t speak for anyone else, but I know my life can always use an extra reminder that God is working behind the scenes.\n\nPsalm 92 is said to be a song for the Sabbath. It’s a declaration of God’s justice (v.15) and His faithful love both in the morning and at night (v.2). We need songs like this, songs of Scripture, to bury inside us and remind us what’s true. This way, on an afternoon that doesn’t feel very beautiful, we can sing the song that declares God is just and advocating on our behalf for the rightness of all things. When we meditate on these songs, our hope is restored. And we can find rest again.\n\nIn this psalm, we see a lot of interesting metaphors drawn from the natural world to describe the characteristics of the righteous person. Though the wicked “sprout like grass” (v.7), the righteous will thrive like “a palm tree” or a “cedar tree in Lebanon” (v.12). The righteous are planted in the Lord like roots of a tree and will live a fruitful life, becoming “healthy and green” (vv.13–14). These arborous metaphors symbolize—and prophesy about—the vibrancy of life hidden in Christ and the nourishment He gives us, just like water and sunshine to a plant. As we pursue a life of righteousness, our legacy becomes this anthem of God’s faithfulness, declaring “the LORD is just; he is my rock” (v.15). \n\nI love how many layers are woven into this psalm. At first glance, we’re told it’s a song to accompany our Sabbath rest. But in reading the lines of verse, we detect the heartbeat behind it: a desire for all things to be made right. The only reason to declare God as “just” is if you’ve been touched by injustice and, by doing so, participate in an act of rebellion against it.\n\nYou’ve probably heard the truism: “All shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well.” It was Julian of Norwich who first said it. She was an English woman who lived a solitary life devoted to God during the Middle Ages. Psalm 92 is the undercurrent to her words. They look ahead to a time when the fullness of God’s justice will have its reign on earth, even as we usher in kingdom wholeness today. \n\nWe can find true rest in the knowledge that God is just; there is “no unrighteousness in Him” (v.15). But He also chooses to partner with us in confronting the injustices of the world. Oh Lord, Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nRemember and proclaim. \n\nThroughout Scripture, we are instructed to recall the ways God has acted on our behalf, and to share those stories of triumph and truth with others, with the next generation of believers (Psalm 145:4). The Israelites’ exodus out of slavery from Egypt? Remember and proclaim (Psalm 105:1–5). The taking of the eucharist? An act of remembering Christ’s life, death, and resurrection—all on our behalf—and proclaiming the infinite gift and power in them for those who believe in the risen Jesus (1 Corinthians 11:23–26). \n\nSo it is in today’s reading of Psalm 145, “a hymn of praise,” attributed to King David, who determines to “exalt, “bless,” and “praise [God’s] name forever and ever” (vv.1–2). Not only will he declare God’s praises, but from one generation to the next, God’s works and acts, His character, power, and righteousness, will be declared (vv.3–5). But in order for that to happen, God’s “awe-inspiring acts” and faithful love must first be remembered. \n\nThere is power in saying something out loud, in speaking truth to ourselves and to one another. Researchers in the worlds of education and psychology call this “the production effect.” Studies have shown that memory is improved by literally speaking aloud what we’re reading, thinking, and studying. The actual retrieval and recall of both past and new experiences, and the relaying of them to someone else further works to etch our experiences and knowledge into our minds. In short, if you really want to remember something, tell someone else about it. It’s incredible to think that God would design us this way, to further draw us into community to speak truth to one another (Ephesians 5:19–20).\n\nThe Hebrew word for “remember” is zakar, and it encompasses more than simply “thinking” or knowledge—it implies action. And in Hebrew tradition, practicing faith in present circumstances and exhibiting hope for the future requires that you remember God’s faithfulness in the past. What better way to remind ourselves of God’s power and steadfast love than to share our experiences with God with someone else? In looking back at God’s “great goodness and righteousness” in our own lives and in the lives of those we read about in Scripture, we are reminded that He provides what we need “at the proper time” and “[satisfies] the desire of every living thing” (vv.15–16).\n\nVerse 20 tells us when we call out to God, He is near. However, His nearness is in no way dependent upon our crying out to Him. No, He is always near, always present. When we draw near to Him, He draws near to us (James 4:8). He does not need an invitation to come to us, but in our calling out to Him, we remember that He is, in fact, a very real and present help (Psalm 46:1). Our mighty, compassionate God is delighted to be in our midst now and always (Zephaniah 3:17; Matthew 28:20). Sometimes we forget this truth, and sometimes we struggle to believe it’s true. Either way, God does not change.\n\n",

He is infinite, but our imaginations are limited. He is unfathomable, so our thoughts cannot plumb the depths. He is the Creator of everything, yet we are constrained by metaphors that come from the created world. The very idea that we might classify or categorize God is laughable. He cannot be tamed or studied. He is beyond our reach and beyond our understanding. \n\nAnd yet we can know Him. He has graciously entered our world, time and time again, so that we might be His children and His true image-bearers. He was in the garden with Adam and Eve. He spoke to Noah, Abraham, and Moses. His presence filled the tabernacle and, later, the temple. He put on flesh and became one of us. And He has gifted His Spirit to His people, in order that we might know Him more intimately still. “The LORD had his heart set on your fathers and loved them. He chose their descendants after them—he chose you out of all the peoples, as it is today” (Deuteronomy 10:15). \n\nWe can know God because He has chosen to be known. He is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-present. He is loving and just, merciful and good, and a thousand other things beside. “For the LORD your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God” (v.17). Theologians have made many a complicated list of God’s attributes, filling thick volumes on shelves that occupy the libraries of this world. But those books amount to what we can know about God. We have been given an opportunity to go much deeper than that. We have been invited to love Him and be loved by Him—to know Him in a way that defies our limited capacity for knowledge and understanding and, in so doing, bring Him glory.\n\nWhatever measure of knowledge we have about God is granted to us so that we might worship Him, not merely as admirers from afar but as dearly loved children. \n\n",

We are always seeking the next, the better, the unknown. Even if we prefer to hold change at an arm’s length, it is inevitable. The seasons shift, the stars fall, our numbered hairs fall out, and our hearts undergo the only constant we know—change.\n\nThe book of Ecclesiastes contains this famous refrain, charged with the impatience, discomfort, and hopefulness of our ever-changing lives:\n\nThere is an occasion for everything,\n\nand a time for every activity under heaven:\n\na time to give birth and a time to die;\n\na time to plant and a time to uproot (3:1–2).\n\nWe live our lives seemingly anchored to little more than change itself. And yet Scripture beckons us to drop our anchor and hold fast to the One who never changes.\n\nOur God is unchangeable because He is perfect. Nothing can be added or taken away from Him. Everything He does is consistent with who He is. God’s promises are the same, and His ability to keep them will never waver. In Malachi 3, God tells His people: “Because I, the LORD, have not changed, you descendants of Jacob have not been destroyed” (v.6). In short, God’s immutability means we can count on Him, no matter what.\n\nJob, whose life changed in dramatic and painful ways, knew God to be always true to His character. “He is unchangeable, who can oppose him?” he asked (Job 23:13). Job staked his hope—his life—on his belief that God will always be who He declares Himself to be and do what He says He will do.\n\nJob’s hope is our hope.\n\nComplete, unchangeable, perfect—this is our God.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nGod is present everywhere in His creation but also above and beyond it. This remained true even as Jesus entered our world as a man and remains true as the Holy Spirit takes up residence within believers.\n\nThe Bible can be described as the story of God’s presence with His people. From walks in the garden with Adam and Eve to the incarnation to the gift of His Spirit at Pentecost, God was there. But the presence of God is not limited to any one location or situation.\n\nUsing a series of rhetorical questions, God outlines the all-encompassing nature of His omnipresence through the prophet Jeremiah:\n\n“Am I a God who is only near… and not a God who is far away? Can a person hide in secret places where I cannot see him?… Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” (Jr 23:23–24).\n\nThese verses not only show that God is both near and far, filling the heavens and the earth, but that He is always with us. There is no escaping His presence. At first, we might find this truth unsettling, but when we understand God’s heart toward His people, we can find it comforting. We echo the words of the psalmist: “But as for me, God’s presence is my good” (Psalm 73:28).\n\nGod’s omnipresence means He sees us, knows us, is with us, and will never leave us. It’s a very practical truth because the greater our awareness of His presence, the more we live with a healthy fear of the Lord. We think twice before giving in to temptation, knowing our sins are not secret. We learn to go through our day with God, abiding in Him moment by moment. We find it a natural thing to pray constantly (1 Thessalonians 5:17), because He is always right there with us.\n\nUpon completing His earthly ministry, and before ascending to heaven, Jesus promised His disciples He would send the Holy Spirit to them. His last words in the Gospel of Matthew are, “I am with you always, to the end of the age” (28:20). We experience Jesus’s constant presence through His Spirit, who lives in all believers. And one day, when Jesus returns, we will see Him not just with eyes of faith, but “face to face” (1 Corinthians 13:12).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nGod knows everything—past, present, and future—and nothing takes Him by surprise.\n\nWhen we stumble and sin, it helps to remember that God is merciful. When we recognize that we have, once again, turned aside to idols of our own making, there are Scriptures that declare God’s faithfulness in spite of our frailty. And when we have been burned by some injustice—life-shattering or trivial—we can thank our Savior for being a righteous Judge who promises to set all things right in the end. Reflecting on God’s attributes can bring us peace in the midst of struggles. But there is one that can leave us feeling exposed: God’s omniscience.\n\nBecause He is all-knowing, there is nothing hidden from God’s sight—nothing in waking life or even in our imaginations. There is no event in the past, present, or future that takes Him by surprise. The entire universe is an open book.\n\nThis kind of knowledge in anyone else’s hands would be a dangerous weapon. It would be appropriate to live in a constant state of fear. But God’s omniscience is coupled with His other attributes. To be known by God, then, is to be valued and loved. None of us are here by mistake. He wants to know us. And that’s a very good thing; within each of us is a desire to be known.\n\nWe all want to be fully known and understood, and then to be fully loved. Of course, we too often conclude in our hearts we are unloveable. After all, we how we’ve done wrong and missed the mark, how easily we’ve given in to temptation. Our hearts condemn us daily. But “God is greater than our hearts, and he knows all things” (1 John 3:20).\n\nOn the day of Solomon’s coronation, David told his son, “The LORD searches every heart and understands the intention of every thought” (1 Chronicles 28:9). In these words, there is a warning, but there is also grace. True, there is no hiding from God. But there also isn’t anyone who could possibly know us better. Because Jesus dealt with our sin on the cross, purifying us as a bride for her husband, God’s omniscience is not reason to fear blanket condemnation; instead, it’s an invitation to true intimacy with our Maker.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nGod has unlimited power over all things at all times. However, He does not act contrary to His nature.\n\n“Is anything too difficult for the Lord?”\n\nThis question has a clear, straightforward answer: No. Nothing is impossible with God. His omnipotence, His all-powerfulness, is perhaps one of the first things we learn about Him. It can also be a spiritual stumbling block for human understanding, in things both trivial and serious.\n\nAlong these lines, you may have heard some form of this brain-teaser: “If God can do all things, is it possible for God to create a rock that is too big for Him to lift?” It’s a question that suspends normal logic in an attempt to stump us, but as C. S. Lewis reminds us in his book The Problem of Pain, “Nonsense remains nonsense, even when we talk it about God.”\n\nIn more serious matters—in times of grief, struggle, and loss—we wonder, Where is God in the midst of my pain? How could He let this happen? Like the disciples, we cry out, “Don’t you care…?” (Mark 4:38). We echo Martha’s sentiments from John 11, saying, “Master, if only you had been here…” (v.21). When we read these stories, we see them met with near-immediate fixes at the hand of Jesus. But we also know that God does not always stop the storm or raise the dead when we think He should. If God is able to do all things, why doesn’t He “fix” all things, already? Why let hard things happen in the first place?\n\nGod holds power over all things, governs all things, and by Him all things hold together (Colossians 1:17). And that power, that impenetrable grip on the cosmos, sustains us through every wind and wave that comes our way, whether or not we remain on our feet. In time, we begin to understand His omnipotence in light of His other attributes. God can do anything, but He does not act against His own character or nature: His goodness and justice, His mercy and love.\n\nWhile His omnipotence is a certain terror to those who oppose Him, it is a resounding comfort to His children; God is good and promises good to those who love Him. Nothing is impossible for Him, and nothing can prevent Him from achieving His good will.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nGod is a triune personal being who enters into a covenant relationship with His people, both individually and corporately.\n\nOur finite, human minds will never truly understand the vastness of God’s glory, nor the fullness of His character. When we consider His infinite greatness, it can be difficult to remember that while He is incomprehensibly grand, He is also personal and relational. He is Immanuel, “God with us” (Matthew 1:23).\n\nWe see this in Exodus 34, when God met with Moses on Mount Sinai. Moses came down from the mountain and found he had to conceal his face with a veil in order to speak with the Israelites. He “did not realize that the skin of his face shone” (v.29) after talking with God—that it was reflecting the radiance of God’s glory and frightening his fellow Israelites. And so, whenever Moses met with God, he would remove the veil, but then put it back on when speaking with God’s people.\n\nIn 2 Corinthians 3, Paul writes that the sacrifice of Christ and the ministry of the Holy Spirit have changed the nature of our relationship with God. We can now gaze upon the glory of God with unveiled faces, just as if we were staring into a mirror (v.18). While Moses was the mediator between God and His people, we now have Christ, the “radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of his nature” (Hebrews 1:3) as our Mediator. Because of Christ, we can enter into relationship with God both corporately as His Church and as individuals. Even more, we have received a Counselor, the Holy Spirit, to remain with us at all times.\n\nOur relationship with God is rooted in His glory and expressed in His immanence. God is present with us, deeply invested and active in each of our lives. He is a personal God. He relates to us, loves us, and cherishes us. Rather than being distant, inaccessible and detached, He has drawn near to us so that we might draw near to Him. By grace, He dwells among us, and by that same grace, He invites us into His presence.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nGod is perfect, pure, and undefiled. He does not sin.\n\nAs God’s image-bearers, we’re called to reflect His holiness. God says, “You are to be holy to me because I, the LORD, am holy” (Leviticus 20:26). It is a seemingly impossible task. We have all been stained by sin and bear on our backs the weight of a sinful nature. Try as we might, we all “fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).\n\nWhen confronted with God’s holiness in the heavenly throne room, Isaiah’s response was nothing short of terror: “Woe is me for I am ruined because I am a man of unclean lips” (Isaiah 6:5). That’s how stark the contrast is between God’s perfect, holy nature and our utter lack of holiness. It’s not even close.\n\nTo be holy is to be set apart, uncommon, and raised up. God is all of these things, and we are not. But His response to Isaiah’s woeful plea was not to leave Isaiah ruined before the throne. Instead, He extended mercy and made atonement for Isaiah’s sin (Isaiah 6:6–7). God, in His perfection, has made a way for His people to be holy, for nothing is impossible with Him (Luke 1:37).\n\nBecause of Jesus’s sacrifice for us on the cross, all things are being made new (Revelation 21:5). We have been given God’s Spirit to walk with Him and practice holiness daily. Someday, all who know Christ will be perfected in Him. On that day, we will reflect God’s holiness to all creation, just as God designed it to be from the beginning.\n\nIn the meantime, God has given us the righteousness of His Son, making us holy in His sight. We are now set apart as His “holy nation” (1 Peter 2:9) and a temple for His Spirit. The holy presence of God that once made Isaiah tremble lives inside of believers. Our hope in Christ is so sure that God already regards us as people who no longer fall short, who have become holy, just as He is holy.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nGod is self-giving, showing mercy and grace toward all creation, especially toward His people.\n\n“God is love” (1 John 4:16). He is always loving—even when He disciplines, even when He judges. It’s who He is. And this divine love is infinite, meaning it is bigger than we could ever imagine, even if we had a thousand lifetimes with which to ponder it. If we were to taste a full dose of God’s love, it would knock us, quite literally, out of our socks. We would be unable to stand in the presence of such passion.\n\nWe were made for God’s love, so it shouldn’t surprise us that the enemy of God’s people chooses to sow doubt at this critical place in our souls. Concerning the forbidden fruit in the garden, the serpent told Eve, “God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil” (Genesis 3:5). In other words, we believe the lie that God is somehow holding out on us, that He does not really love us. It worked with Adam and Eve, and the devil has been using this same tactic ever since.\n\nWe tend to filter what the Bible tells us about the love of God through our experience of love with people who, like us, love imperfectly. The Bible gives us a definition of love in 1 John, imploring us to not define love on our own terms, through our own broken experiences, but instead to see love from heaven’s perspective: “Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 4:10).\n\nEverything God does is loving. But His love is most clearly seen on the cross, because God’s love is sacrificial. He gives Himself for the good of those whom He loves. His love for us is true. There are holes in the hands of our Savior to prove it (John 20:27). Those holes are evidence of God’s love, declaring loudly that He does not withhold a single good thing from us, no matter what the enemy may try to tell us.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nGod is righteous. He is the standard for all that is just and fair.\n\nWe are often unsure what to make of our just God. But His righteousness can and should be cause for celebration, a source of immense comfort in a world where earthly justice falls short.\n\nWe ache for justice when we experience the ramifications of sin, both on a personal and a systemic scale. When something we love is violated, wounded, or broken, we don’t respond with indifference—we cry out, demanding accountability. If we, with our limited perspective, are so affected by injustice, how much more does God demand justice when His standard of what is good is not upheld?\n\nGod loves more deeply and thoroughly than we could ever imagine. He loves perfectly. When proclaiming Himself to Moses, God says He is “a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love and truth, maintaining faithful love to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity, rebellion, and sin. But he will not leave the guilty unpunished” (Exodus 34:6–7).\n\nGod’s understanding of guilt is also perfect, because He is all-knowing, holy, and infinite. He has no statute of limitations. He is not swayed by false testimony or inconclusive evidence. He is the perfect witness, who searches and knows every heart, every intention, every action (Job 28:24; Psalm 69:5). He is “faithful forever, executing justice for the exploited,” even when our lives are not long enough to see it (Psalm 146:7).\n\nUnlike what we experience from one another on earth, God is not faulty or vindictive. He does not overlook sin, nor does He demand more than what is just. This is good news, because we are not only victims of sin and injustice; we are also perpetrators. And yet the steep price our guilt demands is a price Christ already paid on the cross. And “if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).\n\nJesus tells us He has been given the right to pass judgment, and that He gives life to those who hear His Word and believe it (John 5:24). Our just Judge is also our Savior. He alone can mend the brokenhearted and offer hope to the unrighteous.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nGod is the standard of beauty, faithfulness, kindness, and truth. He is the source of all goodness.\n\nTo say God is great is to focus on His power: He speaks creation into existence, makes the skies thunder and rain, and sets the planets in their orbits. But to say God is good is different; it is not just another way of recognizing His power. The goodness of God speaks to His personal character—who He is in relationship to us. In all ways and in all things, God is good. He is never absent, disinterested, careless, ill-tempered, petty, spiteful, or mean. He is set apart from all evil and does what is right, faithful, kind, and true. Always.\n\nTrue goodness is defined by who God is. He doesn’t just do good—He is good. In Psalm 119:68, the psalmist prays, “You are good and you do what is good; teach me your statutes.” The key to understanding the goodness of God is learning who He is through His Word. If we don’t learn His statutes, we will bring our own definitions and impose them on God. And when He doesn’t do what we think He should, we will accuse Him of failing to be “good” by our own standards—not His.\n\nIn His goodness, God gives us what we need and withholds what we do not. If we ask for bread, He will not give us a harmful serpent or a useless stone, He will give us what we need (Luke 11:11; Matthew 7:9). The God who withholds no good thing is the same God who gives no bad thing. Sometimes we don’t realize that we ask God for stones and serpents. When we ask God to give us things that are useless or harmful, the good Father refuses. As sure as He will not give a serpent when His children ask for fish, neither will He give them a serpent when His children unwittingly ask for one.\n\nYes, God is great, but He is also good. All the time and in all things. He does good because He is good.\n\n",

The rest of the morning is a blur—calling 911, then standing barefoot on a neighbor’s front lawn while the fire department extinguished flames on the house we’d finished unpacking only the day before. We’d moved more than a thousand miles to this new place and knew only my coworkers and a neighbor or two through brief introductions. \n\nPeople were quick to help. Near strangers offered us guest rooms and finished basements. A neighbor brought my daughter a stuffed animal to hold. My new coworkers showed up with lunch, and old friends sent gift cards. At one point, exhausted and spent, I found a laundry basket full of toiletries and groceries on the doorstep of our temporary residence. \n\nThe juxtaposition of kind acts against our difficult circumstances kept God, His goodness, and His constancy at the front of my mind. But now, in the safe routine of my daily life, I’m ashamed to say I go long stretches without pausing to thank God. I treat gratitude toward Him like a pile of thank-you notes I never get around to writing. \n\nMaybe the opposite is true for you. Maybe in seasons of abundance, it is easy for you to remember that every good gift comes from God; however, in seasons of sorrow, words of thanksgiving stick in your throat. Still, God’s Word to us in 1 Thessalonians 5:16–17 remains the same: It is His will for us in Christ Jesus to give thanks in everything. \n\nThe Bible presents gratitude as more than a box to check or a note to send. In each of today’s readings, we see that a grateful heart isn’t a response to our circumstances or possessions. It is a posture of worship, an active response to our unchanging God and what He has already accomplished and continues to accomplish.\n\nIn 1 Chronicles 16, David decrees that the people of God give thanks to Him in proclaiming His deeds and sharing about His wondrous works. The psalmist points to God’s faithful love and act of salvation as reasons to thank Him. Isaiah tells us thanksgiving is a privilege reserved for the living. We’re shown in these words how we can cultivate thanksgiving in ourselves by taking time to notice who God is, what He has done, and what He continues to do. \n\nGiving thanks isn’t complicated, but it isn’t easy either. It is a discipline—the habit of turning our hearts and minds to the past and present work of our good God. I pray this study of biblical gratitude will bring you peace and confidence in God’s care for you, and point you toward Him in praise and thanksgiving. We have been given so much in Him.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 136:1-26, Hebrews 12:28-29, Revelation 4:9-11, Revelation 11:16-17\n\nI have a three-year-old right now. (Don’t make fun of me. I’ll remove the marker stains from my table legs and find all my measuring cups when he’s older.) He loves to see things done over and over again. Horsey ride? Do it again! Final chapter of a book? Start it again! Improperly played chess game? Let’s play again! Maybe you have or know children like this—children who delight in simple things.  \n\n Author G. K. Chesterton wonderfully likened the delight of children to that of God’s joy over His creation. He described it in this way:\n\n “Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, ‘Do it again’; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, ‘Do it again’ to the sun; and every evening, ‘Do it again’ to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we.”\n\nOur Father has the energy to forever celebrate and endlessly love. And if there’s one thing that’s worth repeating twenty-six times, it’s “His faithful love endures forever” (Psalm 136:1). But the psalmist isn’t just repeating these words; he’s listing example after example of how God has shown His faithful love to His people. And this insistent repetition shows us how His love isn’t just repeated in the past, because He continues to love us in the future, again and again. Forever.\n\nWe are sinful and just tired out. We grow weary of giving one more horsey ride, handling one more irate customer, navigating another family conflict, and facing yet another rejection. But God’s love is new every morning, and our only response to His steadfast love ought to be thankfulness.\n\nThank you, Lord, for giving us another day to learn and try again.\n\nThank you, Lord, for giving us these beautiful children.\n\nThank you, Lord, for sustaining us and providing everything we need.\n\nThank you, Lord, for your everlasting, never-ending, never-giving-up faithful love.\n\nEven when we don’t have the energy or enthusiasm to celebrate the sunrise, let alone say, “Do it again!” in those dark morning hours, God’s love for us and for His creation is unbounded. He loves us again, and again, and again, and again. In the face of this kind of love, our hearts will warm with thanksgiving.\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her five little people. Rebecca holds a bachelor’s degree in German from Hillsdale College, and most recently worked as the managing editor and writer at She Reads Truth. She now works from her log cabin in the hills of Tennessee, writing and illustrating books with her favorite mountain man. There she enjoys porch-sitting as it rains, reading the Oxford English Dictionary, and getting in way over her head. She is expecting her sixth baby and her first book in February of 2019.\n\n",

His grandma says he’s growing, but what if, instead, he’s just really grateful?\n\nI’ve been paying attention, and our bodies, it seems, give thanks automatically. \n\nLittle girls twirl and giggle with the delight of being alive without ever watching a YouTube tutorial. \n\nWhen we’ve been spared a calamity or rescued from peril, our lungs naturally heave deep sighs that sound a whole lot like “Yahweh,” one of the powerful names of our rescuing God. As we age, our shoulders tend to stoop. Sure, there’s a medical reason for the change, but is it possible that age brings humble gratitude? Might we naturally bend lower as the years reveal the faithfulness of God?\n\nWe tend to think of gratitude like a greeting card, a warm sentiment sent to someone special. Or maybe it’s a journal entry, a place where we are “intentional” to write down our expressions of thanks. \n\nBut what if gratitude doesn’t require pen and paper or a stamp? \n\nHere in 2 Chronicles chapter 6, Solomon’s body seems electrified with thanks. First, he stands and spreads out his hands, gratefully receiving the gifts of God’s favor (v.12). Next, he kneels, lifting his hands toward heaven. We might expect Solomon to parade or puff up at this important occasion. Instead, he lowers his body into a posture of humility (v.13). Gratitude will do that; it knocks us out, and lays us flat. \n\nMary must have knelt before Jesus as she poured perfume on His feet and wiped them with her hair (John 12:3). Since Jesus had just raised her brother from the dead, surely Mary knew the kind of gratitude that leaves us awestruck and weak at the knees. \n\nEventually, we’ll all kneel before Him (Philippians 2:10). I’ve always assumed it was shame or sheer power that would bend our knees, but maybe not. As the beloved, adopted daughters of God, recipients of His undeserved grace, I imagine we will kneel with delight, bowled over with gratitude for the things He has done for us. Quadriplegic Joni Eareckson Tada said it this way: \n\n“On the day I receive my new body in heaven, I’m sure Jesus will be delighted to watch me stretch glorified muscles and dance on tiptoe. But there’s something I plan to do that may please Him more. I will kneel. To choose not to move in heaven will be my demonstration to Him of heartfelt thanks for the grace He gave all those many years when my legs and hands were paralyzed. It will be my sacrifice of praise.”\n\nWe don’t have to wait for the trumpet blast or the moment we are called heavenward to express our gratitude. Like my little fella greets the morning from his bassinet, let’s reach forward in praise right now, refusing to keep our thanksgiving neat and tidy, confined to a postcard or a lined journal page. \n\nMay our hearts learn to bend in gratitude to our God, for there is “no God like [Him] in heaven or on earth, who keeps his gracious covenant with [His] servants who walk before [Him] with all their heart (2 Chronicles 6:14). May we shout it from the rooftops and dance it out in the streets. May we bend our knees in humble thanksgiving, and laugh with utter delight in Him, knowing He delights in us (149:3–4).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Ezra 3:11, Acts 2:42-47, Ephesians 5:15-21, Philippians 4:4-9, Colossians 4:2\n\nI was somewhat unfamiliar with the concept of spiritual disciplines until I took a class on them in seminary. In that course, we read a litany of life-changing books on prayer, fasting, Sabbath, and more. The guilt-inducing tradition of daily “quiet time” in my life was transformed into a rich and beautiful understanding of practices that led me closer to the heart of Jesus.\n\nThere are different ways to categorize spiritual disciplines, which are regular exercises that strengthen our faith. Spiritual disciplines are the stretching, sprints, pace runs, and hill drills of the Christian life.\n\nRichard Foster, who wrote the seminal Celebration of Discipline, places these disciplines into three buckets: inward (meditation, prayer, fasting, study), outward (simplicity, solitude, submission, service), and corporate (confession, worship, guidance, celebration). \n\nAs I read through today’s Scriptures, passages that show us how to give thanks, the actions of gratitude overlapped with many of the spiritual disciplines I’d studied: praise (Ezra 3:11), simplicity (Acts 2:45), corporate worship (Acts 2:46), feasting (Acts 2:46), singing (Ephesians 5:19), prayer (Philippians 4:6; Colossians 4:2). \n\nGratitude is a daily discipline that must be practiced, like stretching after a long run or racing up and down stairs to strengthen different muscle groups. It is an instruction found throughout the Bible—not a “say please and thank you” sort of direction like you would give a child, but a command to bring gratitude into every sphere of living and every moment of the day: “Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!” (Philippians 4:4).\n\nAnd so, we give thanks in practice, with actions: with praise, worship, feasting, singing, and prayer. We give thanks inwardly, outwardly, and corporately. How we give thanks reflects the One to whom we give thanks. He is an active, engaged, intimate, and corporate Father. To Him be all glory, and thanksgiving, forever. \n\n",

For a chronic doubter like me, it has been a grace to view communion in this way. \n\nI often think of the disciples at that first communion, when Jesus took the bread, gave thanks for it, broke it, and gave it to them, saying what must have been cryptic words to the disciples, who didn’t have the advantage of hindsight we do. For them, this seemed an ordinary Passover meal. They didn’t yet know that their Father had been foretelling the story of their Messiah every year for generations. \n\nThere was another meal where Jesus took bread, gave thanks before breaking it and giving it to many, with so many leftovers they filled seven basketfuls (Matthew 15:35–37). Jesus was preaching the gospel in this meal, too, a foretaste of the last supper to come. He was showing them how breaking bread would never be the same again—not because the bread was extraordinary, but because the Blesser of it was. \n\nIn both meals, Jesus was showing His disciples that broken things aren’t the end of the story. He was essentially saying: I give thanks for the breaking about to come, because I know there is a bounty to follow you can’t even imagine. \n\nWhen you next take communion, I encourage you to feel the breaking of the bread in your mouth, to taste every crumb. And I encourage you to thank your Father, as Jesus did, knowing this mere meal points to a gospel more real than you can imagine, and a feast more bountiful than you could ever supply on your own. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 95:1-7, Luke 15:1-10, Luke 17:11-19, Colossians 1:9-14\n\nWhile we wait in the zoo parking lot, my son sits contentedly in his carseat, looking out the window. I watch countless minivans pull in. Women unload their children and strollers and other well-used zoo gear. Eventually, my friend pulls up in her own minivan, and we join the procession, pushing strollers toward the entrance. As we walk, I can see my son’s bare feet sticking out just beyond the shade of the stroller canopy. They are happy feet—slightly tanned, with little flecks of dirt caught under his toenails. \n\nFor years, this scene would have sent me home sobbing, because there was a time when barrenness felt all-encompassing. But as I look around, it hits me: he’s home. The adoption is nearly final now. I really am a mother. The wait is finally over. It’s a moment that makes me want to stop and dance. I want to stop everyone and tell them all the ways God has been faithful to me, to my husband, to our new son. \n\nSeasons of joy can feel rare in this life, but when they come, God invites us to throw a party, to celebrate His goodness. Jesus’s parables are full of parties! Have you ever noticed this? Over and over again, fattened calves are slaughtered, invitations are sent out, banquet tables are set. Jesus calls us into a joyful, hopeful, peace-that-passes-understanding kind of living that turns the music way up. He invites me to celebrate, because praise brings me into His presence. And He wants to be with me.\n\nLife is full of valleys. But it is essential to remember that valleys are made of two mountains. We may reap in tears, but joy will come. God doesn’t tell us when, but He does promise that He will restore all the years the locusts ate (Joel 2:25). And when that happens, let us not hide our joy away for fear of being boastful. The same God who mourns with us in the valley will be ready to dance with us on the mountaintop. \n\nPerhaps you don’t feel like you have the resources to praise God right now. That’s okay. God’s Word says we ought to “give thanks in everything; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus” (1 Thessalonians 5:18). Such a command might seem like a burden during a season when prayers seem to go unanswered, but it is really an invitation to freedom. Even when walking through a deep valley, we can be confident a mountain is coming. We can praise God despite our current circumstances because He is good and He does not forsake us. \n\nThis kind of praise is counter-cultural to the world we live in. It’s not intuitive. Praising like this requires practice. Partying and celebrating like this requires practice. It’s a practice of remembering that God is always with us. “Let us enter his presence with thanksgiving; let us shout triumphantly to him in song” (Psalm 95:2).\n\nThat day in the zoo parking lot woke me up. For years, I’d missed out on God’s parties. Thanksgiving is available to me at all times—whether things are good or bad, whether my heart is aching or singing. And as I walked through the zoo, listening to the animals lift their voices to their Creator, I tried to do the same. \n\n",

Weâ€™re not quite Napa Valley, but we do have grape vineyards as far as the eye can see. Each year, at our Grape and Fall Festival, we roll up our pant legs and step into giant vats of grapes, just like in my favorite episode of I Love Lucy. As the grape pulp squishes between our toes, juice runs out of spigots to be made into wine. It’s a process I enjoy during our annual town festival but struggle to embrace the rest of the year. \n\nLife hands us plenty of sour grapes doesn’t it? I’m sure I’m not alone in feeling perpetually squeezed and squashed. We can all empathize with the psalmist who wrote,\n\n“Be gracious to me, LORD,\n\nbecause I am in distress;\n\nmy eyes are worn out from frustration-\n\nmy whole being as well. Indeed, my life is consumed with grief\n\nand my years with groaning;\n\nmy strength has failed\n\nbecause of my iniquity,\n\nand my bones waste away” (Psalm 31:9-10). \n\nAnd yet, God calls us to face suffering with “abundant hope” (Romans 15:13), to “count it all joy” (James 1:2). Instead of pouting, wilting, or wailing in the face of sorrow, God asks us to”rejoice” (1 Peter 4:13).\n\nHow can this be?\n\nBecause He is already distilling our sour grapes into new wine. Because He promises to “satisfy the weary sou” – replenish it (Jeremiah 31:25). Redemption was purchased at the cross and will be finished when Christ returns for us. On that day, we will gather together for the marriage supper of the Lamb and raise our glasses to the God who has who redeemed our souls and our suffering. The pain that seems so palpable now, will become but a fading memory.\n\nAs we await that day, we can rejoice and be glad because God’s love is faithful. We can trust Him because He has seen our affliction and knows the troubles of our souls, and His response to our suffering is to offer us freedom that can only be found in Him (Psalm 31:7-8). Sure, we can drop our heads and keep staring at the hurt. But we can also choose to respond with thanksgiving instead, knowing that every sorrow is something God has already started to transform. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Ecclesiastes 5:18-20, Genesis 2:4-9, Genesis 2:15, Nehemiah 2:11-18, Psalm 90:17, Acts 20:35, Colossians 3:17\n\nEven before the fall, we were created to work (Genesis 2:15). And while it feels good to sleep in on occasion, I believe we all can agree on the immense satisfaction that comes from work. Many of our proudest moments come from a job well done. (I’m looking at you, summer garden strawberries.)\n\nThough we were created for work, the work we have to do is not always work we love. Because of the curse, we will sometimes work really hard and see nothing for our efforts. (I mean, I planted fifty watermelon seeds and not one watermelon. I’m sure it could happen to anyone. No big deal.) For our work to be profitable, the Lord must redeem it and bless it. When everything comes together, we get to do work that we love, work that yields a good result and is blessed by the Lord. I think that’s everyone’s dream.\n\nHow do we achieve this dream of perfect work? What can we do to get the Lord to “establish the work of our hands”? (Psalm 90:17). Here’s the tricky bit. We can’t. The favor of the Lord looks different at different times, and wealth and success are not necessarily measures of His favor. Our task is to keep working with a good heart, even when the circumstances are far from perfect.\n\nThe greatest work of all is the work of our salvation. That work has already been done by Christ-all our work is secondary to His. So we work from a place of thankfulness and obedience, knowing that the greatest work is already complete.\n\nNehemiah worked from a place of trust and thanksgiving (Nehemiah 2:17-18). He didn’t know that one of the gates he rebuilt would mark the spot where Jesus would one day enter Jerusalem, riding on a donkey as the people shouted “Hosanna!” (Matthew 21:1-11). We don’t always know precisely what work we are called to do or for what purpose; I find that I rarely know. But we do know we are called to do good work, and that we are called to continue our work faithfully. We work and hope because the greatest work has already been done for us.\n\nWhether you feel you are engaged in the greatest calling of your life, every day singing with purpose, or if you are planting seeds in a garden with little hope that they will sprout, you can echo with Paul: “Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him” (Colossians 3:17).\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her five little people. Rebecca holds a bachelorâ€™s degree in German from Hillsdale College, and most recently worked as the managing editor and writer at She Reads Truth. She now works from her log cabin in the hills of Tennessee, writing and illustrating books with her favorite mountain man. There she enjoys porch-sitting as it rains, reading the Oxford English Dictionary, and getting in way over her head. She is expecting her sixth baby and her first book in February of 2019.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Numbers 6:22-27, Exodus 20:8-11, Micah 4:1-5, Luke 10:38-42, John 14:27, Hebrews 4:9-11\n\nI’m the person who makes an itinerary for vacation. I resist the urge to print or laminate anything, but I almost always create a list. I do it, partly to get the most fun out of a trip, and partly because I feel awful when I don’t accomplish things. Even on vacation, I feel the need to be “productive.”\n\nThat is why I am shaken by Jesus’s words, “I do not give to you as the world gives” (John 14:27). Lately, I’ve been noticing that what the world gives me isn’t worth what it wants in return. The world asks me to hand over my time, energy, and talents in return for a tiny piece of a fading empire. And the world is never satisfied. When I give her my best, even sacrificing my health and desires, her admiration lasts but mere moments. She always wants more from me.\n\nEarly on in life, I learned to chase what the world could provide. I became a planner and an achiever. I found my worth in accomplishments, however fleeting the reward. I forgot how to be still. But the lesson I’ve been learning is that I will never find peace in the way of the world.\n\nAre you like me? Have you believed the lie of the world, that it will give you happiness if you just try harder? The message of Jesus is completely contrary to the message of the world. While the world promises happiness it will never deliver, Jesus pledges peace from His Spirit. While the world asks us to scramble like rats on a wheel, our Father God asks us to stop and rest.\n\nWe all want joy and peace, but few of us listen to the Lord’s guidance on how to get it. From the very beginning of time, God clearly commanded men and women to rest. Six days the Lord labored, and on the seventh, He rested (Exodus 20:11). He instructed His people to do the same, blessing the Sabbath day. Of all the Ten Commandments, I think our culture downplays this one the most.\n\nEven within Christian culture, we can confuse our worth with our work. Serving others is honorable, but when you can’t stop for even a day, you are listening to the voice of the world.\n\nThe almighty Creator didn’t need to rest from His work because He was weak, tired, or spent, and yet He chose to do just that. As bearers of His image, our souls were created to mirror the Lord in all things, including rest. God allows us—even commands us—to rest.\n\nThe world is a lousy gift giver. No matter what it offers us, what we really need can be found in the arms of the Father. God calls us into the rhythm He established at the formation of all things. It’s a rhythm good for our souls. The Son of God invites us to Himself, saying, “Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). Let’s give thanks today for Christ’s restful way that leads to peace.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 23:1-6, 1 Chronicles 29:10-13, Deuteronomy 6:10-15, Haggai 1:2-6, Philippians 4:12\n\nSaying thank you is something we learn to do almost as soon as we can speak. We’re taught to thank a person for things like passing the salt, blessing us after we sneeze, or holding a door open for us. The absence of a thank-you in those circumstances will most likely draw disapproving looks, and your parents’ skills in raising a decent human being will be severely questioned.\n\nThere’s an unwritten rule in our culture that when someone does something kind for us, we owe them something in return. From the time we’re little kids, we’re conditioned to offer thanks when we experience good at the hand of another. And it logically follows that the not-so-good things don’t deserve our thanks. We’re not taught to offer thanks when a stranger stumbles into us on the street, let alone when a friend offends us. And why should we say thanks? We feel slighted, and now they owe us. It seems so simple: Good things deserve our gratitude. Bad things deserve our righteous indignation—or stale indifference at best. Makes sense, right?\n\nWhen I read Paul’s words to the Philippians, I have one eyebrow raised in defiance. Of course Paul, arguably the greatest missionary of all time, has “learned the secret of being content” (Philippians 4:12). How am I, a regular girl with a regular life, supposed to get in on that secret to contentment? I fill my mind with “evidence” to prove that I should be excused from being content in every situation: unanswered prayers, a dry bank account, and broken relationships top the list of reasons I might be excused.\n\nAnd then, of course, I’m confronted with my sin once again. The Holy Spirit has a way of knocking me off my feet and onto my knees in the gentlest way. (This can leave me simultaneously exasperated and grateful, if I’m honest.) As I consider what it means to give thanks and be content in all things, I see hidden in my heart an attitude that tells me I deserve every good thing coming my way. Conversely, whenever I consider myself in a season of lack, I can start to believe God owes me for my inconvenience.\n\nYikes.\n\nWhen I actually take a minute to examine my life through the lens of the gospel, it becomes awfully clear who owes who in my relationship with God. Here’s a hint: it’s me. It’s always me. Because even in times of struggle or hardship, the fact remains that each breath I breathe is a mercy of the living God. In times of abundance and plenty, I’m still dependent on Him—nothing I have is of my own strength or ability.\n\nEverything in Paul’s life was laid before the Father, everything was offered in service. And so whatever he was forced to endure was nothing compared to the glory of a life poured out in obedience to God. That’s the secret to contentment: it’s all about God, not me. From Him, through Him, and to Him are all things. To Him be glory forever!\n\n",

If I take a sleeping aid, I fall asleep quickly—but then wake in the middle of the night, wide-eyed and alert. If I don’t take a sleeping aid, I lay in bed for hours with my mind racing. I should put a little notebook at my bedside where I can jot down all the brilliant ideas I’ve had as my husband and pup snore softly in the darkness of our room. I would probably be more productive in the morning, armed with a list of midnight solutions.\n\nAlong with those sleepless moments of clarity, though, there have been painful realizations about my character and personality—things I’m less likely to want to collect in a bedside notebook. Areas of my heart where fear, guilt, or shame arise. Places I’d rather the Lord not see or address in my thought-patterns or ruminations. I feel my frailty in those night-time hours, far more than I feel them the following morning.\n\nDavid, too, knew the vulnerability of the night and of God’s discipline to him in it.\n\n“I rise at midnight to thank you\n\nfor your righteous judgments.”\n– Psalm 119:62\n\nIn sleeplessness, David—the one after own God’s heart, whom God relentlessly pursued for His purposes—thanked God for His righteous judgments. He thanked God for keeping His promise to deal with sin, to not overlook it. The fact that God disciplined David for his sin and it kept David awake at night, shows God to be attentive to sin and to His children who wrestle with it.\n\nJesus Christ has taken our punishment in full, the recompense for our sin. But the pressing discipline of God, shaping and forming us more in His likeness, is the promise of the Father to all His children (Hebrews 12:6). In Psalm 94, David speaks again of the Lord’s discipline, describing it as a “relief from troubled times” because “the administration of [His] justice will again be righteous, and all the upight in heart will follow it” (vv.13.15). And so by pressing in to God’s discipline, instead of away from it, we will gain His wisdom and understanding—“a garland of favor” on our heads, a “crown of beauty” (Proverbs 4:1–7).\n\nI don’t know when those moments of restlessness and conviction happen for you, when you see the discipline of God as both painful and good, difficult and righteous. Maybe it’s when you’re up late into the dark morning hours. Or perhaps when you are confronted with a difficult situation or person. Or maybe it happens when you’re simply bored or sad, withdrawing just enough to finally be still and listen.\n\nI can choose to be thankful for God’s attentiveness as He reveals my heart to me, or I can continue to run from His discipline. But I want be like David, instead—intentional with my waking moments and grateful to God that He never sleeps or slumbers through my life (Psalm 121:4). He is always with with me, ready to awaken me to His righteous judgments, which are always for my good and His glory.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 7:36-50, Ephesians 2:4-10,  2 Corinthians 4:7-15\n\nWhen was the last time you kissed someone’s feet? When was the last time that you had enough tears to wash… anything?\n\nThis story in Luke 7 exists to show us a genuine response to God’s overwhelming mercy. I wonder what commotion this woman’s weeping must have made at the Pharisees’ table. Imagine her there on the floor, openly weeping in front of strangers. She disregards their disapproval and makes a radical display of devotion. Jesus bends down, looks her in the eyes and holds her hand. Then He wipes the tears from her face and tells her the truth: Her weeping is not in vain. Her sins are forgiven. She came in weeping, but can go out rejoicing.\n\nMeanwhile, the hosting Pharisee does not ask who she is, what she’s doing, or why she’s doing it. He doesn’t provide her a seat at the table. He assumes that since he knows about her past, he knows everything about her future too. He talks about her, but doesn’t care for her. He judges her by what she’s done, not by what God will do for her. He’s misses the miracle. But when Jesus looks upon this weeping woman, He sees the beauty in her sacrifice and in her heart. When Jesus sees her, He offers her abundant mercy and a new identity.\n\nThis is our God! When I humble myself before Him, He forgives everything and puts my feet on a whole new path. When Jesus explains His parable of the creditor with two debtors to the Pharisee, He says, “Her many sins have been forgiven; that is why she loved much. But the one who is forgiven little, loves little” (Luke 7:47–48).\n\nThis woman isn’t a worse sinner—she’s a better seer. Unlike the Pharisee, she sees her sin for what it is. She knows her debts and doesn’t try to minimize them. Rather than trying to hide her mistakes, she grieves openly for how she’s failed. In using the parable, Jesus is inviting the Pharisee to see his sin with a clearer vision, to see that the molehill of sin in his heart is actually a mountain. Right perspective on the magnitude of sin leads to a radical posture of gratitude toward God.\n\nJesus isn’t saying we need to sin more in order to love Him more. He’s inviting us to see the evil of our sin without mitigation. Only after taking a brutally honest look at ourselves will we be able to appreciate the merciful, caring, forgiving gaze of our Savior. He lovingly looks us in the eyes and gently wipes away our tears. He sets our feet on new paths. May we focus on that change today and, with grateful hearts, thank Him for all He’s done for us.\n\n",

As an anxious kid, I used to stay up at all hours of the night, terrified that our house was going to burn down. Though wildfires aren’t normally a concern in Alabama, where I grew up, the fear of fire fed my anxiety throughout my childhood and shifted into other worries as I got older.\n\nWhen I started driving, I worried about whether or not I’d closed the garage door after pulling out of the driveway. When I moved into my own apartment, I worried about whether I’d locked the door, or left the stovetop on, or—Oh my goodness, did I unplug my curling iron, or is it going to be sitting too close to that hand towel and burn the whole building down?\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nThe simplicity of the heading from today’s reading in Matthew 6 grabbed my attention and made me pause. “The Cure for Anxiety,” huh? If there is one, I sure haven’t found it, I thought. After so much time in therapy, I’d tried and failed to do the seemingly impossible: cure my anxiety.\n\nI don’t know about you, but over the years, I’ve been taught that if I can just conjure up more faith, just pray more, the anxiety will go away. For a long time, I thought I was a “bad Christian” because I couldn’t just “let go and let God,” like all the inspirational quotes on Pinterest told me to.\n\nGiving thanks in the midst of anxiety isn’t about a cure for worry or a band-aid for the bullet hole of thoughts spiralling out of control. It’s about recognizing the majesty, sovereignty, and power of the God we serve. This is what Jesus says to us about our anxiety:\n\n“Therefore I tell you: Don’t worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Isn’t life more than food and the body more than clothing? Consider the birds of the sky: They don’t sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you worth more than they?” (Matthew 6:25–26).\n\nAs someone dealing with an anxiety disorder on a day-to-day basis, I know that if I take a minute to step back, place my feet firmly on the ground, and take a deep breath, I will find a great deal of comfort in these verses. There is comfort in the knowledge I serve a God who loves me and knows me more intimately than I could ever imagine—He knows exactly what I need (v.32). And so, even when my circumstances feel overwhelming, I can look to the God who sees me and calls me His own, and I can celebrate Him and the peace His salvation brings me (Habakkuk 3:18).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: Isaiah 40:27-31, Luke 2:25-36, Romans 8:18-28\n\nJust wait on God.\n\nEasier said than done, right?\n\nIn Isaiah 40, I see a promise-making God, who has existed forever, created everything, knows—literally— everything. If I were a betting woman, I’d put every dollar in my bank account on any promise that the God with those qualifications made. With a résumé that stacked, I would be making the safest bet in the universe. All power belongs to God, and He’s promised to share it with us. In verse 31, there’s a promise for those who wait on the Lord:\n\n“But those who trust in the LORD will find new strength. \n\nThey will soar high on wings like eagles. \n\nThey will run and not grow weary. \n\nThey will walk and not faint” (Isaiah 40:31, NLT).\n\nGod has promised to strengthen His people while they wait through the power of His Spirit. I’ve experienced the fatigue that comes from continuing to hope in the Lord—trusting in His promises, but failing to see their tangible manifestation. And while weariness will come, I can testify that the Holy Spirit has always provided me with the supernatural strength to endure.\n\nSimeon is an exceptional example of the Holy Spirit’s power to increase a person’s capacity for waiting. Scripture tells us God had made Simeon a promise: he would not see death before seeing the Lord’s Messiah (Luke 2:25–26). By the Spirit, Simeon was imparted with the supernatural strength, patience, and faith to believe God’s promise—the promise that was fulfilled in the Christ child resting in Simeon’s aged arms. Still, I wonder if he ever became weary as he hoped for Israel’s consolation. Imagine the overwhelming joy in his heart when he realized the long-awaited Messiah had finally come!\n\nIn Romans 8, the apostle Paul reminds us that our hope and expectation shouldn’t be reserved for this present world, in what we can see and touch. For “hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience” (vv.24–25). These words written by the apostle Paul were meant to encourage persecuted Christians living in Rome—to redirect their hope and longing to the promise of the world to come, where the kingdom of God reigns without limit or exception. May God use Paul’s words to do the same in you and in me.\n\nBelievers everywhere, along with all the rest of creation, are waiting with eager expectation for the redemption of all things (vv.22–24). When Christ returns, every wrong will be made right and every tear will be wiped away. There will be no hunger or thirst, no war, depression, or despair. Our hearts may grow weary with the state of this world, but we can rejoice while waiting for the glory of its redemption (and the fullness of our own!), because God’s strength gives us power to wait. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "In Everything, Give Thanks",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 5:12-28, Psalm 105:1-6, Micah 6:8, Colossians 3:12-16\n\nThis summer we drove from Tennessee to California in a shuttle bus. My one caveat as we planned the trip: I can’t handle this while pregnant! But two weeks into our travels, I sat down in the back of the bus as we bumped along the highway through Fargo, North Dakota, and started doing some figuring, resulting in the words, “Husband! Stop the bus!”\n\nAn eighty-eight-cent pregnancy test told us I was pregnant. So there we were, in the middle of the country—just as far from home as we were from our vacation destination—hearts full of joy with the best secret. It wasn’t what we’d planned, but we’ve found it’s so easy to be thankful for good surprises.\n\nThere are so many things that do not go as planned. For me, these unexpected circumstances have often been of the pregnancy-related variety. Here’s the thing: growing our family has never gone as we’d planned.\n\nI imagine you’ve experienced this too. The college you planned on going to wasn’t the one you actually attended. Your high school sweetheart ended up marrying someone else. You entered into a six-month-long interview process but didn’t land the job. You had far less time with a parent or a child than you ever could have imagined. We’ve all experienced a change of plans, a change of expectations. Still, somehow, in the midst of things swerving left when we were expecting them to turn right, we’re called to give thanks:\n\n“Rejoice always, pray constantly, give thanks in everything; \n\nfor this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus” (1 Thessalonians 5:16–18).\n\nIf we are to rejoice always, that means our rejoicing cannot be dependant upon our circumstances. If we are praying constantly, that means we ought to be praying even when we feel that things are going well, like we’ve got everything under control. If we are giving thanks in everything, that means we’re thankful not just on Thanksgiving Day, but also when things don’t go the way we had planned.\n\nBut how? How can we give thanks in all circumstances? How can our thankfulness be ongoing? It’s far too easy to slip into a lazy, lip-service kind of thanksgiving. Or to read 1 Thessalonians 5 and feel the pressure to give thanks in spite of what’s happening. But we aren’t only called to give thanks in spite of what’s happening; we’re called to give thanks because of our God—because this is His will for us in Christ Jesus.\n\nThe foundation of a life of thanksgiving is seeing God for who He is. It is keeping our eyes fixed on Christ. When He is front and center, there is always abundant reason for thanksgiving. No circumstance or surprise, whether welcome or scary, is able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.\n\nSo let us give thanks to the Lord and call on His name. Let us sing to Him, praising and proclaiming His goodness. Let us honor and seek Him above all else—because, regardless of our circumstances, our God is always worthy of our gratitude (Psalm 105:1–5).\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her five little people.

The Israelites adapted the name Elohim from El, an ancient word for “god,” to refer to the one true God. This name emphasizes His greatness and majesty over all creation and all other gods. Throughout Scripture this name is paired with descriptive words to distinguish God and His character from pagan gods (e.g., El Olam, “everlasting God,” El Roi, “God who sees,” and El Rahum, “merciful God”).

It comes from the word used to describe human masters who ruled over servants.

Adonay is a reminder that we serve a holy, sovereign God who is Lord over all.\n\nKurios, or “lord” in the New Testament, was used to show respect to people with authority like emperors or masters. It is used to describe both God the Father and Jesus the Son in the New Testament. When followers of Jesus called Him “lord,” they showed Him honor. In Paul’s letters, he used the word as a title for the risen Jesus. “Lord Jesus Christ” became a primary way to refer to Him, implying He shared the authority of the God of Israel.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessica Lamb\n\nScripture Reading: Genesis 1:1-25, Isaiah 45:12, John 1:1-5, Hebrews 11:3 \n\nIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\n\nAll children, except one, grow up.\n\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times…\n\nOf all the most memorable first lines in literature, I’ve always loved the opening of God’s Word most:\n\nIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\n\nWhen I read these words from Genesis chapter 1, I’m often tempted to focus on the “how” in this opening passage. How has God always existed? How did He create Creation? How does He hold everything together? I try mining the text for answers about timelines and processes. But the Bible doesn’t emphasize the “how” as much as it draws our attention back to the “who” at the center of the story: God created. God saw that it was good. Genesis 1 doesn’t explain the details of how God created everything as much as it focuses on the nature of God Himself, the Creator.\n\nGod speaks and acts with purpose. He speaks the universe into existence. He moves the sky, mountains, trees, and oceans into place. Animals swarm and plants flourish at His command. None of this happens randomly—each part of the universe is arranged by Him. We live our lives in the world He’s created and sustains with purpose.\n\nGod is good, and He made everything to be good. Genesis 1 repeats the phrase, “and God saw that it was good,” six times (we’ll see it a seventh time in tomorrow’s reading). As God reflects on His creation— His handiwork—He tells us it is designed to be good. Later we’ll read how sin darkened the world with sickness and death, deception and decay, betrayal and greed. But it wasn’t created this way. It was created wholly good, and God had a plan to make it whole and good once again.\n\nOur good God wrote—and is writing—the story of the gospel. \n\nFor the next two weeks, we’ll read through the movements of this gospel story: creation, fall, redemption, and restoration. The word gospel means “good news,” and that news for us is this: when the time was right, the kingdom of God broke through on earth in the person of Jesus Christ. \n\nJesus, the Son of God, accomplished for us in His life, death, and resurrection what we could not accomplish for ourselves—forgiveness for our sin and reconciliation with God. The Creator demonstrated His love for the created in that ”while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). \n\nThe gospel story is for you, whomever you are, right where you are today. It is for those who believe, to remind them of the truth that continues to change them every day. And it’s for those who don’t believe, who are seeking or doubting or anywhere in between. \n\nThe opening words of Scripture are the beginning of an invitation to know and be known by the God who still speaks and acts with purpose, and who is working to make all things truly good.\n\nJessica Lamb consumes books, tea, and street-style tacos with equal ferocity.

    "devo_title": "God Created Mankind in His Image",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Genesis 1:26-31, Psalm 8:1-9, 1 Corinthians 15:47-49\n\nWhen God created man, He scooped up the new dust of the new earth, blew the breath of life into it, and fashioned a man in His own image. Man is the only creation made in the image of God! It’s hard to know exactly what this means, because God is spirit and does not have a body like man (John 4:24). So bearing the image of God doesn’t mean we have His nose or His widow’s peak; it means we are eternal beings, worthy of worth, value, and dignity.\n\nEach one of us, every human being—regardless of where we are born or whether we can do calculus—carries this worth, value, and dignity imparted to us because we are God’s image-bearers. You can hear David’s incredulity in Psalm 8 when he marvels, “What is a human being that you remember him?” (v. 4). \n\nPaul perfectly articulates this tension between the glory and honor of being an image-bearer of God and being made from the gritty dust of the earth. We are both earthly and heavenly.\n\nIndeed, it seems like all this glorious attention and honor is more than we deserve. In fact, it is. Since the fall of humanity, we have marred this gracious glory of being God’s image-bearers with our sin. Now we are tempted to use our dominion over creation to hurt and control instead of steward and love. Nevertheless, God’s image remains inextricably stamped on our very being, even in our fallen state.\n\nIn his sermon “The Weight of Glory,” C.S. Lewis reminds us of this enduring truth:\n\nThere are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations—these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit—immortal horrors, or everlasting splendors.\n\nAll our actions, friendships, feuds, sidelong glances, and grocery store checkout interactions have eternal significance, for good or ill. The fall of humanity did not eliminate either our worth or our responsibility as God’s image-bearers.\n\nThe glorious news of the gospel is this: the perfect glory of who we are supposed to be is not lost forever. We have the promise of perfection restored and made even more glorious in Christ. Adam, the first man, was made of dust. But the second Man, Jesus, came from heaven. He was not created, but is coexistent and coeternal with the Father and the Holy Spirit—together as the Holy Trinity, they always have been and always will be (John 1:1–4). If we are in Christ, we straddle the life of the first man and the second Man; we bear the image of both. And in the end, because God has been mindful even of us, we will one day bear His image perfectly, reflecting the glory of Christ for all eternity.\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her five little people. Rebecca holds a bachelor’s degree in German from Hillsdale College, and most recently worked as the managing editor and writer at She Reads Truth. She now works from her log cabin in the hills of Tennessee, writing and illustrating books with her favorite mountain man.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Genesis 3:1-19, Deuteronomy 28:15-19, Isaiah 1:4-5, Romans 5:12-14\n\nFrom the time my pigtails bounced and my skirt twirled, I’ve always been a “good girl”—just ask my mama. I was a straight-A student who rarely got in trouble. I picked the right college, the right fella, the right outfit. You get the idea.\n\nTurning my life over to Jesus ripped my story into two distinct halves: life before Him and life after Him. Still, there isn’t a lot of drama in the “before” part. No skeletons in the closet. No criminal record. No massive public failures. It’s tempting to think that Jesus died to make me a new and improved version of myself: Erin 2.0. \n\nI’ve been walking with the Lord for more than two decades now, and the strangest thing has happened. The longer I know Him, and the more familiar I become with His Word, the uglier my heart looks. It’s like one of those optical illusion pictures that just looks like a bunch of squiggles at first. But the longer you stare, the more the edges of a hidden image start to emerge, and you see it’s not a pretty picture.\n\nSure, my behavior screams “good girl,” but my deceitful heart whispers thoughts of jealousy, pride, envy, hate, anger, bitterness, greed—the list goes on and on. Because here’s the truth: the Bible tells us no one is good except God alone (Romans 3:10). The achievements, accomplishments, and attitudes we attempt to polish up with a high shine are destined to look like filthy rags next to His blinding holiness (Isaiah 64:6).\n\nOur sin—and the sin of our first parents, Adam and Eve—is a reality the Bible doesn’t bother to sugarcoat (Genesis 3). We are the children of sinners who produce children who sin. We are not a people defined by our goodness, but rather all of humanity is “weighed down with iniquity” (Isaiah 1:4). We, all of us, have turned our backs on our Creator.\n\nWhen it comes to holiness, there is no bell curve. The Bible warns that everything, every single thing in our world is cursed by our sin and rebellion against God: our civilizations and our agriculture, our food and our children, our crops and our herds, our coming in and going out (Deuteronomy 28:17–19).\n\nIt has taken my entire life, but my good girl facade has cracked. Praise God. Following the rules doesn’t make me righteous, but the good news of the gospel keeps picking me up and dusting me off. “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).\n\nFacing up to the reality of my sin hurts. But when I wrestle with the gospel, the gospel always wins. Being good is not enough, but the thoroughly sufficient grace of a good and loving God is.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Genesis 4:1-16, Genesis 6:5-6, Jeremiah 17:9-10, Romans 6:20-23\n\nThe progression of Cain and Abel’s story in Genesis 4 can be summed up in three words: offering, sacrifice, curse.\n\nOffering: Cain and Abel both make offerings. Cain’s is rejected by God, not because the offering in and of itself is bad or wrong but because Cain’s heart behind it is. Abel’s is accepted, not because his offering is better but because “the Lord had regard for Abel” (Genesis 4:4).\n\nSacrifice: God warns Cain not to let his sin get the best of him, but Cain succumbs to it and kills his innocent brother. And his blood cries out to God from the ground (v. 10).\n\nCurse: Cain is cursed with fruitless labor and a restless, wandering spirit—a punishment that is too great for him to bear (v. 13).\n\nIt is not a hopeful ending, and humanity continues to suffer the consequences of this curse for generations to come. It’s a curse I feel even today.\n\nThis spring I spoke at women’s conference at a church. I prepared for months, reading Scripture, commentaries, looking up Greek and Hebrew verbs. A couple of weeks before the event, I found myself in the depth of shame over an old sin pattern I had fallen into yet again—the one I say I’ll never do again and then inevitably always do.\n\nHead in my hands, I asked God, How can I speak on a stage, proclaiming your Word while knowing the sinner I am? In that moment, I could not see beyond the curse. I felt the weight of Jeremiah 17:9: “The heart is more deceitful than anything else, and incurable—who can understand it?”\n\nThe progression of Christ’s story in the Gospels is similar to Cain and Abel’s, with a much different ending: offering, sacrifice, resurrection.\n\nThe imperfection and curse in Cain and Abel’s story was ultimately corrected and perfected through the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. He lifted the curse. We are no longer wanderers laboring for fruitless gain. As Paul says, “Since you have been set free from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification—and the outcome is eternal life!” (Romans 6:22).\n\nOur sin nature, like our shadows, is the dark side of us, one that we can ignore until the light hits us at the right moment and exposes it. Of every critical aspect of the gospel, sin is perhaps our least favorite to talk about, but it is also the most necessary in order to fully understand the salvation and hope offered in Jesus.\n\nThat day of the conference, as I was sitting in shame over my sin with only the curse as my truth, I felt the Holy Spirit point out the choice I was making. I was choosing the enslavement of the curse over the freedom of Christ. I realized then that it is not because of how good I am that I am able to speak about the Word of God. It is only because of how good He is. I could choose the curse and refuse to speak, or I could choose Christ and let His power be made perfect in my weakness.\n\nWe are offered this choice every day. My prayer is that even on those days when we feel the depths of our sin the most, we will choose freedom in Christ Jesus. It is for this freedom from sin and shame that He has come to set us free (Galatians 5:1). This is the full and complete gospel. May we choose to walk in it and thank God daily for Jesus’s sacrifice that has made this freedom possible for all who believe in Him.\n\nAndrea Lucado is a freelance writer, Texas native, and the author of the memoir English Lessons: The Crooked Path of Growing Toward Faith.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Isaiah 24:1-6, Matthew 19:16-22, Romans 8:5-11, 18-25, Hebrews 7:26-28, Hebrews 9:22\n\nHave you ever waited for something you really wanted? Like really wanted. I bet we all have. Whether you wanted a friend on your first day of school, a fairytale romance, or an elf to do your laundry, we all know what it’s like to wait for something to come into fruition. \n\nIt’s hard to be patient when we have big hopes and dreams. We want what we want—now. And while all dreams are different, I believe we do have one in common: above all else, we long for heaven.\n\nIf we’re honest, we all feel unsatisfied with something in this life. From our personal lives to our politics, our world is grumbling and groaning (Romans 8:22–23). Maybe our relationships haven’t provided the community we need, or our jobs aren’t utilizing our full potential. Or maybe we aren’t being the women we know we were created to be. For most of us, there are many sources of personal frustration. Societally, we hear stories of tragedy every day. Tales of injustice and war flood our news feeds. The world is broken. The effects of the fall reverberate in and around us because things are not as they should be.\n\nBut why are we surprised when we encounter disappointment in this life? Where does this strong sense that the world should be better come from? We long for a perfect world we’ve never experienced. C.S. Lewis put it best when he said, “If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world.” \n\nWe were made for another world! In our heartbreak, discouragement, and righteous anger there is a yearning for the new heaven and new earth. Paul describes our eagerness and groaning like a woman in childbirth (v. 22). We can’t wait “for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies” (v. 23). Yet this redemption is not something we can accomplish on our own. Our separation from the holy God is a chasm we are utterly and irrefutably unable to cross. \n\nOnly Christ can reconcile us to God. His sacrifice paid for our sins. His resurrection defeated death forever. The world around us “wastes away and withers,” but we must remember the story isn’t over yet. Jesus came to offer eternal hope, and Jesus is coming back. “The sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us” (v. 18).  \n\nWhen we feel the weight of the pain and brokenness of this world, we must remember the greater story. We are caught in a fallen world between redemption and restoration. We who have the firstfruits of the Spirit within us should be groaning for more, waiting eagerly and with patience. We long for heaven, and heaven is coming.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: John 3:16-17, Matthew 15:29-31, Luke 18:31-33; John 19:28-30; Romans 5:6-11; Philippians 2:5-11\n\nThis is the big show. This is the central truth of our faith. We can quibble over infant baptism and transubstantiation and ordination, but on these points all Christians must come together and agree. God came to earth in the form of a man, and this God-Man lived, died, and rose from the grave. They called Him Jesus. While we were helpless and lost in our sin, Jesus died to save us completely (Romans 5:6).\n\nIt is the truest and most real fairy story ever known. The Church is the princess trapped by the pretending ruler of this world: a dragon who seeks to hoard all he can. The hero slays the dragon once and for all though a mighty and earth-shaking sacrifice. The dragon vanquished, the hero rescues the princess and brings her to his beautiful home. And they literally live happily ever after.\n\nNotice who’s who in this story. We are the Church and the princess: the bride of Christ. What does the princess have to do to make the story come off properly? The answer is… nothing.\n\nWe’d like to think we get to play a champion’s role in the story, but no matter how politically incorrect it may be, we, the bride, are helpless. The princess does not slay the dragon. She awaits the coming of her prince, the hero who will save her.\n\nAs unflattering as it is, we are helpless apart from Christ. If that weren’t enough to make us uncomfortable, Paul reminds us we were also ungodly enemies of God, undeserving of rescue (Romans 5:10). The Church is the the beggar bride, who has gotten overly comfortable living with the dragon. It is Christ who makes us holy, Christ who makes us lovely, Christ who washes us clean and removes the dragonish stench from our garments, preparing us for His kingdom.\n\nBy His life, He emptied Himself of glory, walking in perfect righteousness and enduring every earthly sorrow. By His death, He fully satisfied God’s just wrath against us, washing away our every sin. \n\nBy His resurrection, He defeated death and hell and secured newness of life for those who believe. \n\nBy His ascension, He advocates for us before the throne of grace, guaranteeing our eternal inheritance.\n\nThe great story of the gospel is the story of Christ. His life and death, His resurrection and ascension—this is the gospel. He is the gospel. Thanks be to God.\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her five little people. Rebecca holds a bachelor’s degree in German from Hillsdale College, and most recently worked as managing editor at She Reads Truth. She now works from her log cabin in the hills of Tennessee, writing and illustrating books with her favorite mountain man.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 51:1-19, Joel 2:12-13, Mark 1:14-15, Romans 5:1-2, Romans 10:9-10\n\n“The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near.\n\nRepent and believe the good news!”\n– Mark 1:15\n\nRepent and believe.\n\nOf all the important words used to tell the gospel story, these are the two I’ve struggled to truly understand. Here in Mark 1, Jesus is calling us to repent and believe, but too many times I’ve interpreted His words as “grovel and behave.” Or really, Get your junk together, Kara, and then go out and do the work God has called you to. \n\nSometimes it’s easier for me to fall in line with the idea of God’s justice than it is to trust and receive His love for me. To trust Him, I have to be vulnerable, my heart and mind laid bare before Him. And yet to even begin to understand God’s gift of salvation, I have to understand my need for it, my need for Him. \n\nIn all of Scripture, David’s words in Psalm 51 have to be some of the most vulnerable, self-aware, and unguarded. Many of us know this part of David’s story and the impetus of this psalm—how he lusted after Bathsheba, bedded her and committed adultery with her, and then had her husband Uriah, his friend and confidante, murdered (2 Samuel 11–12). David left behind an enormous amount of suffering in the wake of his desire, and this psalm proves his awareness of his sin. But in the midst of all that relational wreckage, he confesses to the Lord: “Against you—you alone—I have sinned and done this evil in your sight” (vv. 3–4).\n\nDavid is grieving his sin before his Maker. He knows he is utterly lost and in need of God’s forgiveness when he prays, “God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me.” The earthly king is asking God to restore what’s been lost: the joy and peace that can only be found in right relationship with God (vv. 10–12). \n\nOur sin grieves God, and it should grieve us, too. For those who don’t trust Jesus for salvation, sin separates them from an eternity with God. For those who do trust in Him, their salvation is secure, but sin can still prevent them from experiencing an abundant, vibrant relationship with God now, on this side of heaven.\n\nLike David, we all have sinned and fall short of God’s glory and perfection. But this is the good news: we’re not called to live perfect lives. Jesus already did that for us! His righteousness is ours if we believe and trust in Him (Romans 3:23;10:9–10). We are called to continuous repentance, to keep turning away from our sin and the false promises of this world, and to turn back to God with all our heart (Joel 2:12).\n\nIf you’re anything like me, there have been times when you’ve struggled to believe you’re truly forgiven and radically loved (Zephaniah 3:17). You’ve heard the righteous rebuke in Jesus’s call to repent, but perhaps not the loving invitation to turn back to Him, and to continue coming back—not because your salvation isn’t secure, but because He knows our rebellious hearts keep us from knowing and enjoying His presence today. \n\nThe time has come! Jesus—Immanuel, “God with us”—has come near. Repent and return to Him. And then keep turning back to Him. Believe the good news is true, and that it’s true for you.\n\n",

The judge sat on her bench somewhere in Florida, and as she spoke, we strained to hear every word. The journey to adopt our son had begun long before he was ever conceived. Now, he was seven months old, and a judge was making a final judgment in his case. \n\nShe looked at the facts, asked us her questions, and evaluated the progress he’d made since coming into our care. In the end, she made the final adoption decree. From that point forward, she said, it would be as if “the blood of Patrick Gibson and Claire Gibson were running through his veins.” I burst into tears—shocked at the beauty and finality of that legal language. This little child, who had no idea what was going on, had just had his life changed forever. \n\nThis is God’s grace to us. When we were weak, He left everything behind to come find us, save us, and adopt us into His family. At the cross, a final judgment was made on our behalf about our family, about our future. In essence, the gospel decrees over us: “From this point forward, it is as if the blood of Jesus were running in their veins.” \n\nWhat occurred at Calvary is a mystery—beautiful and scandalous and hard to understand. But throughout Scripture we are given word pictures to help those of us in the physical world understand what Jesus accomplished for us in the spiritual world. \n\nIt’s like an adoption (Galatians 3:26–4:7). We were lost but Jesus transferred us legally into His family, forever making us His brothers and sisters with access to the Father’s great riches (Romans 8:17; Colossians 1:12).\n\nWe were like lost sheep (John 10:1–18), but Jesus guided us gently to safety. We were once helpless, but Help came to rescue us.\n\nWe were once dead in our sins (Ephesians 2:1–5), but Christ made us alive again. \n\nWe had failed (Romans 3:23), but Christ gave us His perfect record as a substitute for our own. Grace is the lifeline we couldn’t throw to ourselves.\n\nAll of these metaphors are mere pictures of what we will one day experience fully, in His presence. But in the meantime, Jesus invites us to live our lives as His children. We can trust the final word of our great Good Judge. What He says sticks. We are children of God, saved by grace through faith in Jesus (Ephesians 2:5). This is our standing both now and forever.\n\nThanks be to our good and gracious God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: John 14:27, Colossians 1:13-23, Colossians 3:1-4, 2 Corinthians 5:17-19, 1 Corinthians 15:51-57\n\nThere have only been a few moments in my life when I have felt perfectly at peace. Moments of sweetness and beauty so profound, they leave me feeling as though the veil between now and eternity is lifted for just a moment, long enough to breathe in before the exhale drops me back into the mundane. \n\nWe live in this in-between, in the “already but not yet” reality of Christ. We only receive a few precursors of perfect peace in our mortal bodies, when our desire for heaven is almost satisfied for a second. We crave heaven because it is what we were made for. We long for peace because our hearts are hard-wired for it. \n\nIn her novel Housekeeping, Marilynne Robinson describes longing for peace like this: \n\nTo crave and to have are as like as a thing and its shadow. For when does a berry break upon the tongue as sweetly as when one longs to taste it, and when is the taste refracted into so many hues and savors of ripeness and earth, and when do our senses know any thing so utterly as when we lack it? And here again is a foreshadowing—the world will be made whole. \n\nToday’s passages give me similar moments of peace and pause. Colossians 1 and 1 Corinthians 15 are both banner moments in Paul’s writings. I can hardly read them without the very best kind of tears filling my eyes. These passages provoke the deepest, unfulfilled places in my heart. They remind me that I was made for a perfect eternity.\n\nOur eternal peace with God will be better than anything we can ever imagine. We will put on, as Paul writes so hopefully, our incorruptible bodies—new and perfect versions of ourselves (1 Corinthians 15:53). We will also be fully reconciled with God. \n\nTheologians categorize the work of Christ into different buckets, one of which is Christ as our reconciler. Sin alienates us from God and it makes us strangers to His mercy. There is an uncrossable chasm between us. But when we know Jesus and believe in Him, He makes our peace with God. He binds us up into covenant relationship, into perfect peace. \n\nJesus doesn’t offer that peace to us as a pretty gift wrapped in a bow; rather, He spent His breath and bones to purchase it for us, “making peace through his blood, shed on the cross” (Colossians 1:20). And so because of His blood, we claim reconciliation as God’s people. We will be reunited to Him forever. Death is no longer an uncrossable chasm. Death has lost its sting, having been swallowed up in Christ’s victory on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:54–55).\n\nAs those who have been raised with Christ, let us seek eternal things, not earthly things. One day He will appear again, and we will join Him in glory. But as we wait, let us rest in the peace of Christ today. Lord, hasten the day of your return.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 24:1-2, Isaiah 65:17-25, Revelation 21:1-5, Revelation 21:22-27, 2 Peter 3:10-13\n\nOf all of the gospel promises, the promise of future restoration is perhaps the most hopeful for me and also the most difficult to understand. Having only known a broken world, how do I even begin to imagine what the new creation will look like?\n\nPain will no longer exist? Death, crying, and grief will no longer exist? The wolf and the lamb will eat together? Aging will not be an issue?\n\nI love the idea of all of these things, but like trying to imagine a new color, I don’t have a frame of reference for them. And so they feel more like a far-off dream than a future reality. But whenever the big picture of Scripture is too hard for me to imagine, it helps me to zoom in closer, to look at the passage on a smaller scale and consider where I’ve seen this truth play out in my own life.\n\nPerhaps trying to imagine this earth returning to its Eden state is too difficult, but has God not already done the same work of restoration in me? At the very heart of the gospel is a God who restored us to Himself through His Son Jesus Christ. Now anyone who is in Christ is a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nThis means restoration is happening now. Newness is happening now. Maybe we can’t imagine what the new heaven and new earth will look like, but we need look no further than ourselves in order to see the power of restoration and possibility of newness through our Father.\n\nThis gives me even greater hope. Because now my hope is not just in the future restoration. I can be assured that restoration is possible today. By the work of the Spirit and with the example of Jesus Christ, we—as a new creation ourselves—can work toward this restoration in our relationships, in our work, and in our communities.\n\nAs the apostle Peter said, the promise of the new creation has great implications for how we live our lives today:\n\nBut the day of the Lord will come like a thief; on that day the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, the elements will burn and be dissolved, and the earth and the works on it will be disclosed. Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, it is clear what sort of people you should be in holy conduct and godliness as you wait for the day of God and hasten its coming (2 Peter 3:10–12).\n\nIf God could restore us to Himself, how much more could He restore? Relationships, communities, broken dreams—not only will all that is broken be made new on the next side of heaven, but God is making things new on this side too.\n\nToday, when I read about the new creation I am trying to see it not as some sort of ethereal image I can’t comprehend, but as proof that God can restore all things in heaven and on earth. His promise of restoration doesn’t have to puzzle me; it can energize me, giving me purpose in how I work out restoration here until the day of our God.\n\nSo if you are doubting today whether the brokenness of this world can ever be mended, or that true reconciliation could ever happen, or that the pain will ever go away—look to Scripture and what God has done for you and and remember His words, said in present tense, “Look, I am making everything new” (Revelation 21:5).\n\nAndrea Lucado is a freelance writer, Texas native, and the author of the memoir English Lessons: The Crooked Path of Growing Toward Faith.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Isaiah 53:1-6, John 19:1-5, John 19:28-30, Romans 8:1-4, Revelation 5:12\n\nEaster 2015 was particularly memorable for the Davis clan. We had new baby sheep on our little farm, and I got the bright idea to take one of those sweet little lambs to our family Easter celebration at my mom’s house. My nieces and nephews were smitten with the lamb, so much so, that they decided to take him for a walk. You can probably guess where this is going, even if they couldn’t—the lamb got loose. It seems a herd of children screaming and running toward him caused the lamb to bolt, getting lost in the woods. \n\nThe kids handled the escape pretty well, until someone mentioned the threat of coyotes. Suddenly there was a symphony of screaming and crying. Not even the promise of another chocolate bunny could console them. For more than two days we searched for our lost lamb. His mama stood out in the field and called for him until she was hoarse. I told my boys he was likely a goner. Then someone had the bright idea to put our plight on Facebook. I never saw the post, but I am sure it went something like this: “Easter lamb led to the slaughter by adorable children in church clothes.”\n\nRemarkably, that post led to a phone call; our lamb had been spotted! He had wandered more than five miles in the opposite direction of our farm, was now fleabitten and starving, but he was alive. It was incredible, but the very best part of the story was yet to come.\n\nWhen we opened the gate, the little lamb immediately ran to his mama. And as he nursed for the first time in more than two days, his little tail wagged at super speed. What was lost had now been found. Of course, the lost lamb is a picture of a bigger, more significant drama. God used it to remind me of the wonder of the gospel. \n\nWe all went astray like sheep;\n\nwe all have turned to our own way (Isaiah 53:6).\n\nOur lamb ran away from all that was good for him. He chose to rebel against the safety of the sheep pen in favor of a life of hardship, sickness, and uncertainty. Just like the prodigal son Jesus described in Luke chapter 15, the lamb bolted from the source of tender care, only to wallow about in self-imposed misfortune. Though our lost sheep didn’t hold much monetary value, we searched relentlessly for him all the same. We desperately wanted him to come home. When he did, I was reminded that Jesus pursued me when I was still running away from Him in glad rebellion, in spite of the fact that I was running toward my own destruction. \n\nGuilty, helpless, lost were we;\n\nblameless Lamb of God was He,\n\nsacrificed to set us free:\n\nHallelujah, what a Savior!\n\nI am prone to spiritual amnesia. It’s so easy for me to forget how lost I was apart from Christ. I need frequent reminders that I was once a wayward lamb, helpless, and vulnerable to an Enemy who “is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for anyone he can devour” (1 Peter 5:8). I didn’t save myself from that desperate situation. I couldn’t. Jesus made a way for me to come home and then came looking for me to show me the path back.  \n\n \n\nHallelujah! What a Savior!\n\nText and Tune: Philip P. Bliss, 1875\n\nMan of sorrows what a name\n\nfor the Son of God, who came\n\nruined sinners to reclaim:\n\nHallelujah, what a Savior!\n\nBearing shame and scoffing rude,\n\nin my place condemned He stood,\n\nsealed my pardon with His blood:\n\nHallelujah, what a Savior!\n\nGuilty, helpless, lost were we;\n\nblameless Lamb of God was He,\n\nsacrificed to set us free:\n\nHallelujah, what a Savior!\n\nHe was lifted up to die;\n\n“It is finished” was His cry;\n\nnow in heaven exalted high:\n\nHallelujah, what a Savior!\n\nWhen He comes, our glorious King,\n\nAll His ransomed home to bring,\n\nthen anew this song we’ll sing:\n\nHallelujah, what a Savior!\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: Jeremiah 8:18-22, Luke 7:1-10, 1 Peter 2:24\n\nI hadn’t ever experienced the heartwrenching presence of cancer until my grandmother was diagnosed a little over two years ago. She was 92 years old, and the cancer took over her body quickly. After her diagnosis in May, she declined rapidly throughout the summer, until my mother called one Friday to tell me it was over. She passed away in early September—Labor Day weekend, my senior year of college. I can still remember my best friend, who’d heard the news before I did, bringing me a cup of coffee and sitting with me in my tiny bedroom apartment while I cried.\n\nThroughout that entire summer when my grandmother was sick, my family was already grieving. We were grieving the loss of her independent lifestyle, and the spunk with which she talked about her friends and family. We were even grieving her ability to make the best macaroni and cheese we’d ever eaten.\n\nIs there no balm in Gilead?\n\nIs there no physician there?\n\nSo why has the healing of my dear people\n\nnot come about?\n\n—Jeremiah 8:22\n\nWhen sickness and death invade our comfortable lives, we can find ourselves wondering where to turn. Like Jeremiah, we find ourselves questioning when the healing will come. We pray, we lament, we cry out for help.\n\nGrief hits in ways we don’t anticipate. It’s the macaroni and cheese tasting just a little bit off on Thanksgiving, even though it’s the same recipe. It’s slow Sunday afternoons that feel empty without phone calls to talk about Alabama football. It’s crying in the candy aisle over a bag of Hershey’s Kisses because there was always a bowl of them on her coffee table. Grief is hard. But grief is an appropriate response to pain—it shows that something matters. When something hurts, it’s important to lament it.\n\nBut because of Christ, our lamenting doesn’t have to last forever. We don’t have to put our hope in earthly healing. When the pianist played this melody at my grandmother’s memorial service, I openly wept—not necessarily out of grief, but out of gratefulness for the healing balm found in Christ.\n\nThere is a balm in Gilead\n\nto make the wounded whole,\n\nthere is a balm in Gilead\n\nto heal the sin-sick soul.\n\nBecause of Christ, there is healing. There is hope. There is comfort for the sick, both spiritually and physically. Christ’s sacrifice on the cross gives us new life in Him. By His wounds, we have been healed of our sin (1 Peter 2:24). Christ, the ultimate Healer, bandages our hearts and mends our broken souls.\n\nThere Is A Balm In Gilead\n\nTraditional Spiritual\n\nThere is a balm in Gilead\n\nto make the wounded whole,\n\nthere is a balm in Gilead\n\nto heal the sin-sick soul.\n\nSometimes I feel discouraged\n\nand think my work’s in vain,\n\nbut then the Holy Spirit\n\nrevives my soul again.\n\nThere is a balm in Gilead\n\nto make the wounded whole,\n\nthere is a balm in Gilead\n\nto heal the sin-sick soul.\n\nIf you cannot preach like Peter,\n\nif you cannot pray like Paul,\n\nyou can tell the love of Jesus\n\nand say, “He died for all.”\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Abide with Me",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: John 15:1-8, 1 John 3:18-24, Numbers 23:19, 1 Corinthians 15:50-58 \n\nThe hymn “Abide with Me” is my funeral song. It is the song that, after what I hope is a very long and sweet life, I want sung by my people when I’ve gone to glory. \n\nIt is also my living song, one that I have turned to in so many seasons. I sang it for months on end after my beloved grandmother died, as I wandered lost through the fog of grief for the first time. I sang it when my husband and I moved away from our first home, when I wrestled with deep fears and ached for community. I sang it when our best friends’ baby died. I sang it when I, eight months pregnant with a broken body and weary mind, paced for hours on end in the middle of the night, awaiting our sweet girl’s arrival. \n\nFear, death, paralyzing anxiety—these are the things I’ve carried my whole adult life. But this song reminds me that I don’t have to carry them. When I ask for the Lord’s presence to be near, He reminds me that He’s always with me, that He’ll never leave me.  \n\nI am hardly the first person to associate this hymn with death, nor will I be the last. When he wrote the text, Henry Francis Lyte was dying of tuberculosis. It is rumored to have been played by the band on the Titanic after it struck the fatal iceberg. It was played at Mother Teresa’s funeral, and at Richard Nixon’s too. It was played at Ground Zero after 9/11. Joyfully, it was also played at Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip’s wedding. \n\nI love this hymn so much, I could write a dissertation on every line. I love it so much because it reminds me—it floods me—with the goodness, faithfulness, kindness, and trueness of God. \n\nIn Luke 24, Jesus appears to His disciples after the resurrection. They don’t yet recognize Him when they ask Him to stay with them, because the night is falling. Thus begins the first stanza of the hymn—Abide with me, fast falls the eventide. \n\nWhen I hear this hymn, I am drawn to reflect on what it says specifically about who God is: He helps the helpless, and He changes not. He is my guide and my strength, and His grace alone foils Satan’s power. This song also declares that all earthly helpers and comforts will surely fail and fade under the harsh light of sin; change and decay are the norm here in a fallen world. But most importantly, when I listen to this hymn, I am reminded of my only hope, my only comfort in both life and death—Jesus. I need Him every hour. \n\nThis song knits together lament and hope, the way every day of this Christian life does. I ache, and I rejoice. I long, yet I live in abundance. I weep, and I laugh. I will die, but I will also live forever because of Jesus. \n\nAbide with me, Lord—these are the words Henry Lyte penned before he died.\n\nAbide with me, the disciples asked, before they even knew He was already there.\n\nAbide with me, we ask, we pray, we sing.\n\nAbide with Me\n\nText: Henry Francis Lyte, 1847\n\nTune: William H. Monk, 1861\n\nAbide with me: fast falls the eventide;\n\nthe darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.\n\nWhen other helpers fail and comforts flee,\n\nHelp of the helpless, O abide with me.\n\nSwift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;\n\nearth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away.\n\nChange and decay in all around I see.\n\nO Thou who changest not, abide with me.\n\nI need Thy presence every passing hour.\n\nWhat but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?\n\nWho like Thyself my guide and strength can be?\n\nThrough cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.\n\nI fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless,\n\nills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.\n\nWhere is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?\n\nI triumph still, if Thou abide with me.\n\nHold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes.\n\nShine through the gloom and point me to the skies.\n\nHeaven’s morning breaks and earth’s vain shadows flee;\n\nin life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Be Still, My Soul",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 62:1-12, Isaiah 61:1-3, Luke 8:22-25, James 5:7-8\n\nMy soul is not good at being still.\n\nThis morning, I took a book and a cup of coffee to the front porch, and in just a few moments, I was distracted. My phone called to me, trapping me in the never-ending deluge of other people’s happy photos. I wondered about what I’d make for dinner. A calendar alert reminded me of an appointment I’d forgotten. And then time ran out. My moments of solace were gone because I’d given them away to lesser things.\n\nIt is hard to guard stillness because I live in a world that drives me to move faster, do more, and document my achievement. The word “hustle” is everywhere. There’s a constant sense that if I don’t make something of myself, nothing will ever come of my life. I know that it is a lie, but it continues to trap me anyway. In my best moments, I am exhausted. In my worst, I am detached from my soul in a way that is nearly dissociative. How can I know my own heart when I spend so little time with it?\n\nIt is hard to guard stillness because being still allows the emotions I’d rather ignore to rise to the surface— emotions like pain, sorrow, and loss. Fears arise about of the futility of life, how little I’ve truly accomplished, and how frequently I let my friends and myself down. When I’m quiet, my questions for God get very loud. \n\nAre You there, God?\n\nDo You see me?\n\nDo You know how I’m hurting?\n\nDo You truly love me?\n\nMy heart is not always a happy place. Stillness requires me to face my own grief that life isn’t really all it’s cracked up to be.\n\nIn Megan Devine’s beautiful book, It’s OK that You’re Not OK, she writes, “Grief is simply love in its most wild and painful form. It is a natural and sane response to loss.” In the same way, I should not be surprised by the longings, desires, and heartache that surface when I sit in stillness. My heart was designed for something other than this world I live in. The pain and sorrow surrounding me is foreign—it’s no wonder I’m homesick for a place I’ve never been before.\n\nThe hymn “Be Still My Soul” is a song of longing for how things will be, but aren’t yet. There are no silver linings in this song, only the promise of God’s abiding comfort in the midst of my sadness, the promise that He will ultimately dry every tear from my eyes. \n\nI love that this hymn was written and is sung in a minor key, because this life is not a tune of happy hallelujahs. No—it is a thorny way that leads to a joyful end. But I’m not at that joyful end—not yet. And no amount of my effort can produce what only God can accomplish. Only in stillness can I feel His presence. Only in honestly uncovering my deepest wounds can I receive His soothing care.\n\nThe hour is hastening on when I will be forever with the Lord. Until then, let me guard time for stillness—my soul is desperate for it. Until then, may my soul find rest in God’s presence. “He alone is my rock and my salvation, my stronghold; I will never be shaken” (Psalm 62:1–2).\n\n \n\nBe Still, My Soul\n\nOriginal Text: Katrina von Schlegel, 1752\n\nTranslation: Jane Borthwick, 1855\n\nBe still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side.\n\nBear patiently the cross of grief or pain.\n\nLeave to thy God to order and provide;\n\nin ev’ry change, He faithful will remain.\n\nBe still, my soul: thy best, thy heav’nly Friend\n\nthrough thorny ways leads to a joyful end.\n\nBe still, my soul: thy God doth undertake\n\nto guide the future, as He has the past.\n\nThy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;\n\nall now mysterious shall be bright at last.\n\nBe still, my soul: the waves and winds still know\n\nHis voice, Who ruled them while He dwelt below.\n\nBe still, my soul: when dearest friends depart,\n\nand all is darkened in the veil of tears,\n\nthen shalt thou better know His love, His heart,\n\nwho comes to soothe thy sorrow and thy fears.\n\nBe still, my soul: thy Jesus can repay\n\nfrom His own fullness all He takes away.\n\nBe still, my soul: the hour is hast’ning on\n\nwhen we shall be forever with the Lord.\n\nWhen disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,\n\nsorrow forgot, love’s purest joys restored.\n\nBe still, my soul: when change and tears are past,\n\nall safe and blessed we shall meet at last.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 11:25-30, Jeremiah 31:7-13, Isaiah 11:6-10\n\nWhen we had four kids under the age of four, my husband and I were both teaching at a local high school. Our whole life was babies and teenagers. The teenagers played football games on a field so close to our house that we could see the lights and hear the announcer from our bed. But because of the babies, we were always so tired on Friday nights that we couldn’t bear to schlepp all our children across the street to that game. So that’s where we enjoyed those football games—at home, in bed. The bright white stadium lights reflected off our glasses of water, and the play-by-play rattled our bottles of ibuprofen. We were so weary. We felt so old. But we were barely thirty.\n\nThere’s always something or someone ready to wear us out. It doesn’t matter how old you are, this old world is full of weariness. Usually it’s people whose behavior has changed abruptly, money that’s turned out to be missing, or the heartbreak of discovering your life isn’t at all what you expected it would be. \n\nWhatever is making your heart weary today, know that you are not alone. Without exception, we all long for comfort and rest. And without exception, we are inclined to look for it in things that will ultimately leave us unfulfilled. True comfort from world weariness only comes from Christ. He is the only source of true rest.\n\nIn Matthew 11, Jesus promises rest for the soul to all who “come to Him” (vv.28–30). What an inviting promise! Just show up and you will find rest for you soul. But look at the lives of those who did come to Him: His disciples. They dropped everything, their fishing nets and fathers, and followed Jesus. Did they find rest for their souls? They witnessed miracles and even performed some themselves. They defended Jesus, and they denied Him. They saw up close the one true Messiah, and many of them died for their association with Him. Is this what “rest for your souls” looks like?\n\nIn a word, yes. The rest that Christ promises us is not a reprieve from the conflict and complication of the world. But His rest is a change of alignment that gives our souls rest, no matter what weariness is swirling around us.\n\nIf you are looking for all trouble to end, you will not find that here on earth. In this world, you will have trouble, but Christ gives us the ultimate promise that, “I will turn their mourning into joy, give them consolation, and bring happiness out of grief” (Jeremiah 31:13). There will be so many weary days and so many happy days, but the underscore of all our days is His steady comfort and promise. All of this true rest is found only with the true Messiah, and He invites us, just as the words of this old hymn do—to ”Come, oh come to Me”… Linger then no longer.\n\nCome, Oh, Come to Me\n\nText: Lizzie Akers, 1902\n\nTune: James M. Black, 1902\n\nWeary burdened wand’rer,\n\nthere is rest for thee,\n\nat the feet of Jesus,\n\nin His love so free;\n\nlisten to His message,\n\nwords forever blest,\n\noh, thou heavy laden,\n\n“Come to Me and rest.”\n\nRefrain:\n\n“Come, oh come to Me,\n\ncome, oh come to Me,”\n\nJesus now is waiting, calling\n\n“Come, oh come to Me.”\n\nBring Him all thy burdens,\n\nall thy guilt and sin,\n\nmercy’s door is open,\n\nrise and enter in.\n\nJesus there is waiting,\n\npatiently for thee,\n\nhear Him gently calling,\n\n“Come, oh, come to Me.”    Refrain\n\nLinger then no longer,\n\ncome just now to Him;\n\nere the shadows gather,\n\nand thy light grows dim.\n\nThou hast long been waiting\n\nfor some better time,\n\nbut today He’s calling,\n\ncome and claim Him thine.    Refrain\n\nHe will bid thee welcome,\n\nat the blessed cross,\n\nturn to joy thy mourning,\n\nturn to gold thy dross.\n\nHe will lead thee gently,\n\nall along the way,\n\nin the path that shineth,\n\nunto perfect day.    Refrain\n\n",

    "devo_title": "‘Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Proverbs 3:5-12, Romans 8:26-30, 2 Corinthians 1:20-22, Hebrews 9:11-14\n\nI don’t have just one sweet tooth. I have a mouth full of them. But don’t tell my dentist, because the mere mention will probably pre-qualify me for a shiny set of dentures down the road. Chocolate chip cookie dough, funnel cakes with powdered sugar, sour gummies that make your mouth pucker—I’m here for all of it.\n\nCandy, along with other types of “sweets,” like newborn kittens and handwritten notes, are indulgences, unnecessary delights. But when Louisa Stead wrote the hymn, “‘Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus,” I don’t think it was in response to cotton candy swirls or a beautiful stroll in the park.\n\nIn fact, it was a very tragic day at Long Island Sound. What began as a perfectly sunny morning for Louisa, her husband, and their young daughter, Lily, quickly turned into the unfortunate. They sat on the embankment together enjoying a picnic lunch when, all of a sudden, they were interrupted by the sights and sounds of a young boy drowning in the water. Louisa’s husband jumped in after him, but neither the boy nor the man attempting to rescue him survived. Walking away from the scene a grieving widow and single parent, Louisa’s circumstances were anything but sweet. Yet, these are the words she chose to write:\n\n‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,\n\nJust to take Him at His Word\n\nJust to rest upon His promise,\n\nJust to know, “Thus saith the Lord!”\n\nJesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!\n\nHow I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er!\n\nJesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!\n\nO for grace to trust Him more!\n\nWhen our lives reflect the brokenness of this world, it is then that we see trusting Jesus for what it truly is: an absolute necessity. We need Him, but His trustworthiness is what makes trusting Him with our need so much sweeter. \n\n‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus when our worlds are spinning deliciously on their centers, when we’re steady and our sights are set on sugary delights we don’t need. It is sweet to trust in a God who desires to give His children abundantly good things. And ‘tis so sweet to trust in Jesus when everything has fallen apart and nothing resembles the life we’re used to, when we’re disoriented and unable to fix our attention on anything but present pain. It is sweet to trust in Jesus, who identifies with our sufferings and carried them for us in His body and to the cross.\n\nWhile I would never wish Louisa’s loss on anyone, her story lends credibility to those of us (all of us, really) who have felt similar pain, giving us the confidence to proclaim the kindness of our God, even when our circumstances feel anything but kind. When she wrote this hymn, I don’t think Louisa was claiming that her grief had suddenly disappeared by trusting Jesus. Instead, what I hear in her words is the surprise, the sweet relief, that she could still trust Him, come what may. We can, too. O for grace to trust Him more!\n\n \n\n‘Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus\n\nText: Louisa M. R.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 119:105-112, 1 Corinthians 1:18-31, Philippians 3:7-11\n\n“God doesn’t give guidance, he does guidance, and you’re in the middle of it.”\n\nPastor and writer Tim Keller’s words shocked me. I rewound the sermon podcast and listened again. I was in a job I hated—smack dab in the middle of a two-year commitment that felt like it would never end. The world told me that since I was unhappy, I should walk away. And I liked the sound of that. Daily, I pulled into the parking lot and cried, staring at the red-brick building. Inside, 200 seventh graders and several fellow teachers were ready to wear me down, yet again. I wanted to quit. In fact, I was seeking out biblical support to walk away. Instead, Keller’s words cut through the noise.  \n\nI had been praying for God to give me guidance—I wanted Him to show me the way out of my work situation. But Keller’s words reminded me that God had already done the guiding, and unfortunately, He’d led me to this red-brick building. I wanted to leave, but I knew He was calling me to stay. It took every ounce of faith and courage I could muster to step out of my car each day, and into the job He’d called me to. The world tells me to follow my heart, but God tells me to follow Him. It matters greatly which path I choose.\n\nThe words of the hymn “Be Thou My Vision” encourage me in my endeavor to live above the common level of life. Because believe me, when I’ve chosen to follow God instead of myself, He has led me on very uncommon paths. He has led me into places of resistance and uncertainty and darkness. But if I truly want to bring light to the world, I can’t be afraid of the dark. Left to my own direction, my heart is a compass that guides me toward passions and pleasures. But God is the true compass, guiding me along His ultimate path for me, changing my heart and renewing my mind in the process.\n\nAs it says in 1 Corinthians, following God must look like complete foolishness to people who do not know Him (v.18). But my heart is a broken instrument, so how can I possibly trust its direction? Only God is trustworthy to lead me.\n\nConsider the stanzas from “Be Thou My Vision.” See how each word is antithetical to the world’s call to seek our own way—fame and fortune, pleasure and comfort. The lyrics of this hymn are a reminder of who our God is and what He provides. He is with me. He protects me. He provides power. He brings wisdom. He endows me with treasure in heaven. He is my destination, both now and for eternity. And He is my greatest hope. Heart of my own heart, whatever befall, [Lord] still be my vision, O Ruler of all. \n\n \n\nBe Thou My Vision\n\nText: Irish hymn, sixth century\n\nProse Translation: Mary Byrne, 1905\n\nVerse Form:  Eleanor H. Hull, 1912\n\nBe Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;\n\nnaught be all else to me, save that Thou art:\n\nThou my best thought by day or by night,\n\nwaking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.\n\nBe Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word;\n\nI ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord.\n\nThou my great Father, I Thy true son;\n\nThou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.\n\nBe Thou my battle shield, sword for the fight;\n\nbe Thou my dignity, Though my delight;\n\nThou my soul’s shelter, Thou my high tower,\n\nraise Thou me heav’nward, O Power of my pow’r.\n\nRiches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise,\n\nThou mine inheritance, now and always:\n\nThou, and Thou only, first in my heart,\n\ngreat God of heaven, my treasure Thou art.\n\nHigh King of heaven, my victory won,\n\nmay I reach heaven’s joys, O bright heav’n’s Sun!\n\nHeart of my own heart, whatever befall,\n\nstill be my vision, O Ruler of all.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Love Divine, All Loves Excelling",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: John 14:18-25, Colossians 1:15-23, Ephesians 3:8-12\n\nWhat is the greatest love of your life? I know it sounds ridiculous, but I have a white Great Dane named Bess who is pretty high in the love rankings for me. We are in tune to each other without using words, and our mutual love is as steady as a slow walk in a long field. My husband is probably my greatest love—he still looks at me with love in his eyes, after eighteen years, even when I’m my worst combination of bossy and lazy. There’s also my children, who have awakened a love in me that makes me feel like a mighty grizzly bear. And there are also a handful of beloved women in my life, just a few, who have invited me into a community of virtue and laughter that I can’t find anywhere else in the world. We have a lot of chances for great love, and the love of my Great Dane is not, in fact, the least among these.\n\nWe are transformed in small ways by all our loves. Because of Bess, I am defenseless against the sweetness of a soft pink muzzle. Because of my children, I am brave. Because of my husband, I am at peace. Because of my dear friends, I am wise. Love transforms us. I’m sure you are similarly transformed by the loves in your life. But the most profound transformation comes from the love of Christ. This divine love excels all other loves. Where my dog and my husband fail me, Christ’s love stretches as far as the east is from the west.\n\nHow are we transformed by Christ’s love? First, we are transformed from death to life. Jesus promised, “Because I live, you will live too” (John 14:19). A life without Christ is a life of death and ashes; His love transforms these bodies of death to vessels of life. It is a complete transformation that we cannot affect with our own power. \n\nFinish then Thy new creation;\n\npure and spotless let us be.\n\nLet us see Thy great salvation\n\nperfectly restored in Thee.\n\nIt is God’s divine love and mercy that have the power to change us, to bring us from death to life in Him, affecting our lives in profound ways, now and forever. We are loved by the Father and equipped by the Holy Spirit, enabling us to keep God’s commands. Jesus will reveal Himself to us, we will keep His Word, and we will be at home with Him (John 14:21–23). We are fundamentally changed when Christ loves us.\n\nWe are also transformed by His love because we are reconciled to Him. Apart from His love, we are forever doomed to run in circles chasing our sin. When we are transformed by His love, He lifts us off the merry-go-round of sin and reconciles us to Himself. He transforms us from dirty to clean, from darkness to light. \n\nOnce [we] were alienated and hostile in [our] minds expressed in [our] evil actions.\n\nBut now he has reconciled [us] by his physical body through his death,\n\nto present [us] holy, faultless, and blameless before him (Colossians 1:21-22).\n\nI want to be presented before God as holy, faultless, and blameless! What a wonderful mystery of the gospel that I can be transformed from a lost sinner to someone who is holy and blameless! \n\nFinally, Christ’s love transforms us by giving us “confident access” to Himself (Ephesians 3:12). Our access to God is a hard-won privilege, given to us by Christ’s sacrifice for us on the cross. Because of Christ, we can run to our Father in prayer, and depend on Him for comfort in every circumstance. And because of Christ’s love, His loving Spirit breathes transforming comfort “into ev’ry troubled breast.”\n\n \n\nLove Divine, All Loves Excelling\n\nText: Charles Wesley, 1747\n\nLove divine, all loves excelling,\n\njoy of heav’n, to earth come down,\n\nfix in us Thy humble dwelling;\n\nall Thy faithful mercies crown.\n\nJesus, Thou art all compassion;\n\npure, unbounded love Thou art;\n\nvisit us with Thy salvation;\n\nenter ev’ry trembling heart.\n\nBreathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit\n\ninto ev’ry troubled breast!\n\nLet us all in Thee inherit;\n\nlet us find the promised rest.\n\nTake away the love of sinning;\n\nAlpha and Omega be;\n\nend of faith, as its beginning,\n\nset our hearts at liberty.\n\nCome, Almighty, to deliver;\n\nlet us all Thy life receive;\n\nsuddenly return and never,\n\nnevermore Thy temples leave.\n\nThee we would be always blessing,\n\nserve Thee as Thy hosts above,\n\npray and praise Thee without ceasing,\n\nglory in Thy perfect love.\n\nFinish then Thy new creation;\n\npure and spotless let us be;\n\nlet us see Thy great salvation\n\nperfectly restored in Thee.\n\nChanged from glory into glory,\n\ntill in heav’n we take our place,\n\ntill we cast our crowns before Thee,\n\nlost in wonder, love, and praise\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Isaiah 41:8-10, Psalm 46:1-11, Matthew 23:37-39, Mark 10:13-16\n\nI once heard a story of a momma hen found in the rubble of a burned down chicken coop. The hen didn’t survive the fire, but tucked up under her breast, the farmer found her brood of tiny chicks, safely sheltered by their momma’s wings. \n\nThis tender image has stayed with me over the years. I think of it when I drop my children off at school and a familiar pang of fear strikes my chest. It comes to mind when I watch the news in horror. I’m reminded of it when a devastating medical diagnosis hits too close to home, and I can no longer deny that we are broken people living in broken bodies in a broken world.\n\nOur bodies are broken, resulting in sickness that ranges from inconvenient to terminal. Our hearts are broken, leaving us hurting and hungry for relief. Our culture is broken and no political system can fix the chasm. We don’t have to look far to realize all over again, that there is much to fear. No amount of nail biting or floor pacing can change that.  \n\nWhen the world around me feels ablaze, I’m so grateful the Word reminds me that I am tucked safely under the wings of my Savior; there is room for everyone I love to find shelter here too. And we can stake a claim and raise a banner over these bedrock truths found in His Word:\n\nGod is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. The LORD of hosts is with us;\n\nthe God of Jacob is our fortress.\n– Psalm 46:1,7\n\nWe see suffering and beg God to be with those who are hurting. But lean in and listen closely: Every page of His Word declares, “I’m already right here!” We don’t have the promise that our fears are unfounded or that suffering won’t come, but the safest space we can run to is the presence of Jesus. He wants to gather us like a hen gathers her brood (Matthew 23:37), to tuck us in and shelter us as the storm of sin passes over this dying world. \n\nSafe in the arms of Jesus,\n\nsafe on His gentle breast,\n\nthere by His love o’ershaded,\n\nsweetly my soul shall rest.\n\nFanny Crosby, the author of this hymn, surely knew a thing or two about fear and suffering. Blind since infancy, she must have faced more than her fair share of fiery trials. And yet, in addition to penning more than 5,000 hymns declaring the sufficiency of God, she is known to have uttered these faith-filled words: \n\n“Do you know that if at birth I had been able to make one petition, it would have been that I was born blind?…  Because when I get to heaven, the first face that shall ever gladden my sight will be that of my Savior.”\n\nFanny spent her life in the dark, but never alone. In this life she was tucked under the wings of her Savior, knowing that in the next all fear and hurt would fade away. Oh, we are safe in the arms of Jesus, friends. Safe on His gentle breast. In His presence we’re overshadowed by love. So sweetly, our souls can rest.  \n\n \n\nSafe in the Arms of Jesus\n\nText: Fanny Crosby, 1868\n\nSafe in the arms of Jesus,\n\nsafe on His gentle breast,\n\nthere by His love o’ershaded,\n\nsweetly my soul shall rest.\n\nHark! ’tis the voice of angels\n\nborne in a song to me.\n\nOver the fields of glory,\n\nover the jasper sea.\n\nRefrain:\n\nSafe in the arms of Jesus,\n\nsafe on His gentle breast,\n\nthere by His love o’ershaded,\n\nsweetly my soul shall rest.\n\nSafe in the arms of Jesus,\n\nsafe from corroding care,\n\nsafe from the world’s temptations,\n\nsin cannot harm me there.\n\nFree from the blight of sorrow,\n\nfree from my doubts and fears;\n\nonly a few more trials,\n\nonly a few more tears!    Refrain\n\nJesus, my heart’s dear refuge,\n\nJesus has died for me;\n\nfirm on the Rock of Ages,\n\never my trust shall be.\n\nHere let me wait with patience,\n\nwait till the night is o’er;\n\nwait till I see the morning\n\nbreak on the golden shore.    Refrain\n\n",

    "devo_title": "It Is Well with My Soul",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: Isaiah 66:12-13, 2 Corinthians 3:13-18, Philippians 1:12-26\n\n“It Is Well with My Soul” has been a family favorite for generations. My paternal grandmother loved the song, and after she went to be with the Lord my dad would sing it often at church.  I’ll admit I didn’t fully understand what he was singing about. I understood the song was about submitting to God, but didn’t really understand how someone could say “It Is Well with My Soul” when “sorrows” were actually rolling like “sea billows.” At that point, my faith in God was built squarely on the idea that God proves His love to me by allowing good things to happen to me. I imagined God as a good-natured, yet principled, grandfather, who blessed good people with good things and punished bad people with bad things.\n\nThankfully, God destroyed that image. \n\nI had constructed an image of God that was more like Santa Claus than anything else. Santa makes his list and checks it twice, then divvies out either gifts or coal, depending on a child’s behavior. I ordered my life around that idea: If I’m good, nothing bad will happen to me. If I’m bad, God’s going to punish me. It was a see-saw of prideful earning and shame-ridden failure.  \n\nEventually, the beautiful truth emerged that no matter how far I strayed from God, no matter how disobedient I’d been, the Father continued to display faithfulness to me, continued to pursue me, continued to receive me. And yet, another truth came to life: Life with God does not mean a life without pain. Surprisingly, experiencing the things I expected God to shield me from because of my “good behavior” has shown me that He alone is good. His unrelenting goodness toward me is never increased or diminished based on my actions.\n\nWhen peace like a river attendeth my way,\n\nwhen sorrows like sea billows roll;\n\nwhatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,\n\n“It is well, it is well with my soul.”\n\nNow I understand how Horatio G. Spafford could pen these words. Now I see that neither the joys nor the sufferings of this present life could ever compare to the great glory that awaits me in the life to come. With every undeserved grace He’s extended to me, God has given me the incomprehensible peace, soothing the stormy sorrows of my soul. Come what may, God is teaching my heart to sing a new song: It is well with my soul. \n\nBoth God’s goodness and greatness go far beyond what I can see with my natural eyes. It’s the Father’s goodness that sent Jesus to the cross for my sin. And it’s His greatness that raised Jesus to life, seating Him in heavenly places where He continues to intercede for me (Romans 8:34). \n\nMy sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!\n\nMy sin, not in part, but the whole,\n\nis nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more;\n\npraise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!\n\nCircumstances will change, but our God is steadfast and faithful—yesterday, today, and every day to come—and it’s because of His character that we are safe and secure. He is so much more, so much better than we could ever imagine Him to be. \n\n \n\nIt Is Well With My Soul\n\nHoratio G. Spafford, 1873\n\nWhen peace like a river attendeth my way,\n\nwhen sorrows like sea billows roll;\n\nwhatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,\n\n“It is well, it is well with my soul.”\n\nRefrain:\n\nIt is well with my soul;\n\nit is well, it is well with my soul.\n\nThough Satan should buffet, though trials should come,\n\nlet this blest assurance control:\n\nthat Christ has regarded my helpless estate,\n\nand has shed His own blood for my soul.    Refrain\n\nMy sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!\n\nMy sin, not in part, but the whole,\n\nis nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more;\n\npraise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!    Refrain\n\nO Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,\n\nthe clouds be rolled back as a scroll;\n\nthe trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend;\n\neven so, it is well with my soul.    Refrain\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer Praising God’s Greatness",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 145:1-21\n\nPrayer is a startling invitation—one that, after 30 years of following Jesus, I still struggle to accept. \n\n“Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and incomprehensible things you do not know,” the Lord says to His people in Jeremiah 33:3. The book of Hebrews urges the Christ follower to “approach the throne of grace with boldness” (4:16), and Paul tells the Philippians not to worry about anything, but instead to petition God in prayer (4:6). Perhaps most astonishing of all, Jesus Himself instructs His disciples, “Whenever you pray, say, Father…” (Luke 11:2). \n\nCall out to God. Go boldly to the throne. Ask instead of worry. Talk to God as your Father. \n\nThis is the invitation. But what do we say? How do we find the words to pray? \n\nPrayer, like everything else in the Christian life, is a practice learned over time. When it comes to learning the language of prayer, there is no better classroom than the Psalms. The book of Psalms was the hymn and prayer book for the people of God before the days of Jesus. God’s people have been praying these writings, and using them to shape their own prayers, ever since. \n\nTake Psalm 145, for example. This hymn written thousands of years ago by the shepherd-king David teaches me how to express praise to a God who is magnificent beyond words. I often fumble at the beginning of my prayers, unsure how to address this Being who is so holy and so wholly other. But this psalm puts words to God’s greatness, giving me vocabulary to praise the Lord’s “splendor and glorious majesty” and declare His “awe-inspiring acts” (vv.5–6). It reminds me of the power of speaking back to God the immutable aspects of His character: He is “gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in faithful love” (v.8); He is “good to everyone” and “gracious in all His actions” (vv. 9,13). It gives me the scaffolding on which to build my own song of prayer to the Lord who is “near to all who call out to him, all who call out to him with integrity” (v.18).\n\nIn this three-week Psalms for Prayer reading plan, we’ll read fifteen psalms that cover a range of topics, from glorifying God, to praying for our personal concerns, to lifting up the needs of this world. Some of these psalms are worded as prayers offered directly to God; others act as prompts to inspire prayer. All are given to us in God’s complete, inerrant Word. The God to whom David wrote this ancient psalm is the same God you and I pray to today. His Word not only teaches us who He is; it teaches us how to commune with Him in prayer.\n\nMay God use our time in these psalms to reveal to us more of His character. May He draw us into a daily and ongoing conversation with Him, and may His Word teach us to express our hearts to Him in prayer.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer Celebrating God’s Creation",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sandra McCracken\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 104:1-35\n\nI think children often imagine themselves as the center of all things, even the weather. And I think there’s something commendable about their curiosity, how they can attune their hearts and minds to what surrounds them. Psalm 104 gives me the impression that this is a God-inspired curiosity. Here, the psalmist wills his own soul to consider the beauty and majesty of God, and in doing so, his soul is moved to worship our Creator and admire His creation. \n\nHow countless are your works, Lord!\n\nIn wisdom you have made them all;\n\nthe earth is full of your creatures (v.24).\n\nIn truth, it is the Creator who is at the center of creation. God’s glory is revealed in what He has made: in the intricate and majestic beauty of His creation surrounding us. His artistic display is also wrapped up in His very essence, His radiant splendor, and His steadfast character. He wears His creation like a garment and commands it masterfully, setting up the edges between water and land, day and night. His boundaries are loving and lavish. Every green leaf and delicate creek seems full to the brim, right up to the edge of wherever He has ordered it to stop.  \n\nGod Himself takes pleasure in His own creation because it is an expression of His glory, and as His image-bearers, we too, ought to delight in what He has created (vv.31,33). And just as He is everlasting, His works will never cease to praise Him. “He established the earth on its foundations; it will never be shaken” (Isaiah 40:28; Psalm 104:5).\n\nHe wraps Himself in the beauty of creation because He is the holy, nourishing, life-giving presence inside the beautiful cup of creation. His Son Jesus was poured out for us that we may be filled with the finest provision of all—our salvation (Isaiah 53; 1 Corinthians 11). When we take communion, we remember with all our senses that He is our nourishment, that He alone gives abundant life. He alone sustains us, forgives us, and makes us new.\n\n In this mystery, we are planted on this earth, given an address, and we also find ourselves wrapped in the beauty of His creation—from the moment we walk out our front door in the morning to feel the fresh air on our faces and hear the birds singing their morning song. Even this is His provision for us, just as we are nourished daily by His Holy Spirit, feed on His Word, and walk in His presence. \n\nOur God makes Himself known to us in the song of creation and has demonstrated His splendor in every wild beast, in the sound the thunder, in the messages of the wind, and in the blue sky canopy above us. In all of this and more, from start to finish, my heart sings out in celebration with the psalmist to say, “Bless the Lord, O my soul! Praise the Lord!” (v.35).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer for When God Seems Silent",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 77:1-20\n\nI got the call on a Tuesday. The son we were going to graft into our family through adoption was now staying with his biological family, to be raised by his grandmother. I had already packed a bag for the hospital. We were less than a week away from his due date, and now, there was no due date in sight.\n\nIt’s hard to describe the pain of that moment. Four years of infertility. Months of adoption preparation. All the finances invested in growing our family disappeared in an instant, but that paled in comparison to watching our future go up in smoke. The little boy I’d pictured standing between my husband and me, with this dark skin and curled hair, was gone. The thoughts kept pounding at the place between my eyes: I’ll never know what he looks like. I’ll never even know his name.\n\nI’ll be honest: in the moments after that call, I didn’t open up the psalms. Instead, I walked upstairs to the little nursery we’d yet to complete and grabbed the handmade quilt my mother’s best friend had made for the boy. It was meant to warm him as he slept, but now I buried my face in it and wept. I screamed. No one was home but me, and so I let myself go—until my throat quivered and the cries sounded eerily like that of a child wailing for its mother. \n\nThe Message translation of Psalm 77 says, “I yell out to my God, I yell with all my might, I yell at the top of my lungs… my life was an open wound that wouldn’t heal” (vv. 1-2). I know what that feels like. I’d guess many of us do. But how often do we give ourselves permission to yell and cry out like this? How often do we express our sorrow and the fullness of our pain? Not often. \n\nIn an effort to bypass our grief—in fear that God’s silence will be too much to bear—I believe many of us never ask the questions the psalmist so brutally lays down: Where are you, God? Have you forgotten me completely? I thought you were supposed to be compassionate. But this doesn’t feel like compassion.\n\nInstead, we try to end the pain as quickly as possible, either through secular comfort (read: retail therapy) or spiritual practices (read: small groups, counseling, meditation, and yes, sometimes even Bible reading). But Psalm 77 shows us that we can bring our raw emotion to God. We can ask our honest questions without fear. We can scream at the top of our lungs, and God will still listen.\n\nBut the psalmist does not stop with his questions. He asks them, and then he gets up off the floor. It is essential that we bring our honest selves to God, in all our brokenness. But it is just as essential that we are honest about who God is to us. In a place of pain, truth is a hard pill to swallow. But it is the medicine we need most. We need to remember that all His ways are good, even in the midst of our sorrow and pain. The Message translation of the psalm goes on to say:\n\nOnce again I’ll go over what God has done, lay out on the table the ancient wonders;\n\nI’ll ponder all the things you’ve accomplished, and give a long, loving look at your acts (vv. 11-12).\n\nI have a history full of examples to pick from to remember God’s character. After all, the psalmist didn’t know Moses and Aaron—he wasn’t present when God parted the Red Sea—but he praised God for it anyway. Jesus hasn’t ended my sickness, but the stories of when He walked on earth prove that He is our Healer. The ancient wonders remind me of the truth: my current circumstances do not outweigh God’s eternal promises.\n\nThis is the rhythm of faith. Yell out, and then remember.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer Celebrating God’s Word",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 119:1-32\n\nWhen we lived in town, I would occasionally notice an uncanny quiet in the house, and then realize that one of my little boys had escaped. Every Thursday was trash pick up, and the siren song of the garbage truck often proves too strong for the will of toddler boys. Racing after a child who is wandering down the street—myself dressed only in my best approximation of “this will do”—is a harrowing experience. Since we’ve moved out to the country, my fellas are still entranced by all classes of trucks, but now they line up at the fence and shout their admiration from a safe distance.\n\nYou read what makes all the difference, though, right? It’s the fence. In town, all of Franklin, Tennessee, was open to us; it was just a matter of how far we wanted to walk. There was nothing to stop us. But the kids had to stay close to the house. Out in the country, while we only have two acres (my dream come true), they are allowed to enjoy every inch of those acres. The boundary of the fence gives them huge freedom. As long as they stay inside the fence, they are safe.\n\nThere is such a joyful freedom in boundaries. Psalm 119 celebrates the gift of God’s law by extolling the beauty and truth of God’s Word. In fact, that’s the primary focus of this psalm—celebrating God’s law and the boundaries it gives. And it’s given as prayer, which means this psalm is a treasure for teaching us how to pray prayers which delight in surrendering to God’s Word and will. God’s law hems in our lives so that when we are lured by garbage trucks, or whatever delights the world has to offer, we can see exactly how we are to respond. There is such safety in knowing where the lines are, instead of huddling close to the house, unsure of how far we can go. \n\nThroughout this psalm, we encounter a series of refrains—“teach me your decrees,” “I love your law,” “I will not forget your law”—which spill out like shouts of joy. The psalmist is so captivated by the goodness of God’s law, that he cannot help but declare it. He sings of God’s law as if were the very air he breathed. God’s law is the law of love, the law of liberty, the law of life. May we find our delight in his degrees! May it frame our every thought, our every breath. \n\nR.C. Sproul calls the law the “school of righteousness.” Within this school, we learn what pleases God and what offends Him. What a severe joy and a mercy it is to have God’s law, to know where to set our sights, where our boundaries lie, and enjoy the wide freedom within His gates.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer When Battling Anxiety",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 27:1-14\n\nPerhaps you’ve heard it said that in a storm, any harbor will do. When the tidal waves of life threaten to capsize our little ships, we will look anywhere for respite, often seeking shelter in places that cannot ultimately protect us. Age has alerted me to an alarming truth: the waters of life are almost always choppy. Smooth-sailing days are rare in a world as broken as ours.\n\nHere in Psalm 27, we see David sending out the distress signal. He is looking for a lighthouse to point him toward shore. He starts with a pep talk, saying, “The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?” (v. 1). But the answer to his question must have made his knees wobble. I can imagine him now, penning words of praise with one hand, while anxiously chewing his fingernails on the other.\n\nThrough the storm of his own anxiety, he saw an army positioned to take him out. In David’s case, this army may have been literal, but we all know how it feels to be surrounded, hard pressed on every side (2 Corinthians 4:8). We see serious threats against our hearts and homes every day. But we can’t fight our fears by convincing ourselves there’s nothing to be afraid of. There is! The list of rational fears is so significant, there’s not a bucket of sand big enough for us to bury our heads and fully hide from the threat.\n\nRecently, in my own life, physical, relational, and emotional forces collided to create the perfect storm. Many of my worst fears were realized, and my anxiety that there was more to come left me frantically searching for safe harbor. As all other life rafts sunk around me, I finally clung to God’s Word. As His truth anchored me, I found myself locking eyes with the disciples when they faced the storm.\n\n“And they woke him and said to him, ‘Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?’ And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, ‘Peace! Be still!’ And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. He said to them, ‘Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?’ And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, ‘Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?’” (Mark 4:38-41 ESV, emphasis mine).\n\nAny hope that we can calm the storms of life on our own is misplaced. We cannot. But we will find ourselves buoyed when we look for the One no storm can stand against. Ultimately, the disciples clung to the same truths that David did—the same truths that you and I can cling to:\n\nGod is faithful.\n\nHis care is relentless.\n\nHis promises are true.\n\nHis presence is the only place where our fears truly subside.\n\nOur hope is not that the day of trouble will not come, because it will. But our God will see us through. No calamity can untether us from God and His Word. Never. When anxiety twists our stomach in knots, when we look around and see an army of threats, not just any harbor will do. But this one will:\n\nThe Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; he knows those who take refuge in him (Nahum 1:7).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer in Times of Sorrow",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 86:1-17\n\nThere was a season of my life when it seemed like weeping willows were suddenly sprouting on every corner. At the time, I had just taken up a new habit of running and can remember having to duck my head and step carefully on the trails so as to not tangle my feet on their branches. An artist like DaVinci or Monet probably would have been inspired by their presence. Unfortunately, I’m not the kind of girl who thinks poetically about things like pollen. I’m more prone to believe the trees are just standing in my way.\n\nThat’s exactly how I feel about sorrow—it had better stay in its own lane. I wish my experience with sorrow was only as extensive as a good cry at the end of a sad movie. But the truth is my shoulders have been crushed by the weight of grief, leaving me to feel like a weeping willow: arms fallen, exasperated, feeble. I’ve tried not to give myself over to the weight of my sadness for fear I won’t be able to stand back up again.\n\nIt’s easy to see why we call them “weeping” willow trees. They were first given their name because of the way rain falls from their branches resembling tear drops. However, they grow best near water, able to absorb large quantities of water during floods. In fact, when strategically planted beside ponds, they can even help to prevent ground erosion. And in a way, our sorrow is like that too. Avoiding it may appear to be the best survival tactic, but taking it in and then bringing it honestly before God is one way He strengthens and grows us.\n\nProtect my life, for I am faithful (Psalm 86:2).\n\nI used to think weeping willows looked like crippling sorrow, the kind you never fully recover from. They seemed to be consistently sad, their branches swaying on the ground in the wind. Yet, now I wonder if the posture of a weeping willow tree isn’t so much a picture of what sorrow does to us, as it is an image of what we’re to do with our sorrow. Heads bowed in submission to the Lord, we can expose the depth of our sadness to Him without hesitation.\n\nAll the nations you have made will come and bow down before you, Lord, and will honor your name (v. 9).\n\nDespite their appearance, weeping willows are one of the fastest growing trees around, gaining 8 to 10 feet per year. This rapid growth may be one of the reasons they have a relatively short life span. But to me, somehow this signifies the promised end of our sorrow. While the layers of sadness that fill us here on earth are many, joy is our eternal posture.\n\nLord, give strength to your servant (v. 16).\n\nSorrow stretches us in ways we probably wouldn’t ever choose for ourselves, but it strengthens us all the same. Deep sorrow makes way for great joy. By His grace, may we embrace the sorrow that seems to stand in our way, allowing it to remind us of God’s kindness, of how He strengthens, comforts, protects, and renews us. In this way, our hope and joy are not far off and distant, but present with us each and every day, just as He is. Amen.\n\nBring joy to your servant’s life, because I appeal to you, Lord (v. 4).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer for Mercy",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 6:1-10\n\nWhen I was a high school senior, I audited an upper-level English literature course at a local college. The professor assigned two novels, both of which were written in 18th-century English, and extremely hard for this 18-year-old to decipher. Luckily, the professor explained each reading at length, and though much of that course has disappeared from my memory, I’ll never forget a quote from George Eliot’s Middlemarch. For some reason, it implanted itself in my mind, and I doubt it will ever leave. It reads:\n\n“If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence.” \n\nWhat I take from that quote is this: If we could hear “all ordinary human life” it would be deafening. Can you imagine hearing everything? From the simple growth of the grass all around us, to the cries of children in the night from hunger, to the millions upon millions of groans that go up to the Lord each moment? I cannot fathom the sound.\n\nThat’s why, when it comes to Psalm 6, I know I’m on holy ground. \n\nI don’t know for certain what left David so shaken that he wore himself out with groaning—although, there are plenty of scenarios to choose from in 1 and 2 Samuel. His best friend’s father was trying to kill him. He had to hide away in enemy territory for decades. The only men who went with him were desperate, indebted criminals (1 Samuel 22:2). In many ways, he was alone in the world.\n\nI don’t know exactly why David wrote this psalm, and I don’t know how you’ll relate to it, either. Perhaps the imagery of crying nightly against your pillow is no imagery at all. Perhaps that’s your reality. Marriages falter under the weight of years of sorrow. Children defy our expectations and hopes. Relationships plunder our hearts, leaving us to clean up the wreckage. Even the best, most hopeful times of our lives, leave us wondering what lurks around the next corner. \n\nIf your eyes are open, if your heart is beating, you know that life is full of perpetual ache. Like George Eliot said, if we could hear it all, “we should die of that roar.” But here is the beautiful thing about our God: He hears every single prayer. He catches our tears in His bottle (Psalm 56:8). And though we are unable to bear the weight of that much sorrow, He can. And He has (Isaiah 53:3-4).\n\nAfter reading the seven preceding verses about grief, I love the final three in this psalm, how the idea of hope emerges from them. I can imagine David writing them, taking a deep, post-cry breath—you know the kind. Maybe it’s still shaky. But it fills your lungs with oxygen and enables you to sit up straight and wipe the tears from your eyes. David rises to face his fears, not because his circumstances have changed, but because he is confident that the Lord has heard his weeping, and accepts his prayer (Psalm 6:9).\n\nWhatever tears you are shedding today, rest in confidence that the Lord hears you clearly. He knows you, accepts you in Christ, wants to commune with you, and longs to be gracious to you, even in the darkest hours (Isaiah 30:18).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Wynter Pitts\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 23:1-6\n\nHave you ever had everything you’ve ever wanted, yet still felt unhappy? I have. At the time, I was fully aware that most people would take one look at my life and suggest that I had everything I needed, but somehow it didn’t feel like enough. It wasn’t that I was ungrateful for what I had, I just wanted—longed for—something more, something else. \n\nI will never forget that morning when I woke up, looked around my bedroom and burst into tears. I was married to a wonderful man. I was the mom of four healthy, happy daughters. I had friends and family that loved me, and although our lifestyle was not lavish with shopping sprees and shiny things, we were able to live on a single income—just one of the many answered prayers that had filled that season of my life. And in that moment, right outside my closed bedroom door, I could hear my husband of six years, giggling and enjoying an easy morning with our girls—more answered prayers.\n\nSo why was I crying? I felt empty and alone, and I felt guilty about both. Although my tears were streaming from a place of discontent, they were also layered with the guilt from the reality of those feelings. I was ashamed to acknowledge that answered prayers had landed me in one of the most uncomfortable seasons of my life. It seemed as if all I had prayed for was still not enough to fill me up and grant me what I thought it might deliver. It was in this very moment that God reminded me of what I was desperately seeking. It was a void His presence alone could fill. \n\nI wasn’t looking, but He found me. I wasn’t asking, but He gave me more in a moment than I would have ever asked. I was reminded of these words:\n\nThe Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing (Psalm 23:1).\n\nAs simple as they are, these words penetrated my soul and began to take up new real estate in my heart. God had answered many of my prayers, yet I’d failed to realize that His promises do not always arrive on smooth paths. But regardless of circumstances, He does promise to provide His comfort the way a good shepherd does—with a little pulling, prodding, and nudging in the direction He knows is best. The shepherd’s presence is everything to his sheep. \n\nIn the same way, in God’s presence, we need nothing more, nothing but Him. He provides and protects, and His love fills us up to overflowing. When we look to anyone or anything else but Him, we will always be left unsatisfied and wanting. Our Good Shepherd knows exactly what we need—when to get up and when to lie down and rest. He calls us to turn our focus toward Him, to be reminded that His presence is enough. He alone supplies all the guidance, provision, and comfort we will ever need.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 51:1-19\n\nSelf-awareness. It’s a funny thing—you either have it or you don’t. And if you don’t, it usually takes a pretty embarrassing situation to make you aware that you are not self-aware. \n\nFor instance, have you ever been in a crowded room, talking to a group of friends, telling a fantastic story, having the time of your life, when you realize everyone in the room has quieted down because your enthusiastic voice has filled the entire space, distracting everyone from their own personal conversations and— \n\nNo? Just me? Cool. \n\nMy point is this: Self-awareness can be hard to come by. And when it “comes by,” it can be… uncomfortable. \n\nDavid wrote Psalm 51 after being hurled into self-awareness by the prophet Nathan. David had just slept with Bathsheba, gotten her pregnant, and ultimately, had Bathsheba’s husband killed to cover up what he’d done. And somehow, it wasn’t until Nathan confronted him that David was brought to his knees over his sin. Boom. Crippling self-awareness. This is the context for David writing in verse 3, “For I recognize my rebellion; it haunts me day and night.” \n\nAwareness of our sin in the presence of a holy God can be an unbearable weight. How could we ever measure up? It’s impossible!\n\nThat’s why I’m glad David isn’t only writing out of an awareness of himself and his own brokenness. His self-awareness is accompanied by an acute “God-awareness.” He knows the God he’s approaching. He comes before God as a man in the wrong, but with an expectation that this holy God, who eternally exists in unapproachable light and holiness, also removes sin, erases blame, and restores joy to those who love Him. He is a God who unwaveringly desires to have David in good standing with Him.\n\nI don’t know about you, but being confronted with the awareness of my own sin can be an oppressively cruel experience. Not only am I made aware of how far away I am from the holiness of God (and that distance is light years!), I often compound that feeling by hurling insults at myself, heaping on guilt and shame. I stand before myself as judge, jury, and accuser, certain that God could never accept me or approve of me because I’m just not good enough. And I wouldn’t be wrong. I’m not good enough. I never will be. I could never meet up to the standards of the holiness of God on my own. \n\nBut here’s the good news: God knows that. And He’s made a way for those who love Him to have access to Him in order to receive His forgiveness, which He freely extends through Christ. This is the God we serve. \n\nSo when I come before God, humbly aware of my sin, I don’t have to abuse myself, bowing beneath the weight of self-hatred and defeat. I can approach Him boldly and with confidence because, just like David, I have a “God-awareness.” I know the God I come before, and He silences the accusations, dismisses the guilt, and loves me out of my shame. Not only that, but every time I approach Him in humility and expectation, He makes me more like Him.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer for Justice to Prevail Over Evil",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 55:1-23\n\nI locked myself in the closet and tried to pray despite my bleary eyes and knocking knees. I simply couldn’t face the day. It was too hard, too painful. There was no resolve to muster, no bootstraps big enough to pull myself up by. When I read Psalm 55, I wonder if, perhaps, the psalmist penned it from a similar place.\n\nThis is one of the things I love most about the Word of God. It is not sanitized, polished up to a high shine, and put on display. The Bible does not stick to feel-good mantras or platitudes that make us all smile and nod. There is grit between the pages because, let’s face it, there is grit in all our lives. \n\nThe psalmist opens this passage begging to be heard. There’s no swagger oozing from the tip of his pen. No pretty, religious language found in these verses. He is desperate. His need to hear from the Lord is visceral. \n\n“Listen to me!”\n\n“Don’t tune me out.”\n\n“Do You hear me?”\n\n“ANSWER ME!”\n\nHis gut-level honesty makes me want to stand up and cheer. \n\nBecause there are days I can’t start my prayers neat and tidy. There are moments when my need is so great, and my heart is so tied up in knots, I can’t get much past the lump in my throat. There are times when, if I’m not sure He’s listening, I don’t know how to find the strength to go on. If I could see myself in these moments, I imagine I might look something like Hannah, crying out to God, so wrought with despair that I look drunk or crazy (1 Samuel 1:9-18). \n\nBut God heard the cry of Hannah. He heard the psalmist’s plea. And when we are restless, in anguish, afraid and trembling and horrified, or fighting the urge to take flight (Psalm 55:2,4-6), He hears us too. It seems desperation is a prayer language of its own.\n\nIt was a medical crisis that sent me to the closet that day. It was betrayal by a dear friend that sent the psalmist reeling here, to writing this psalm. Whether it’s the horror of what you see on the news, or the pain of a personal crisis, cry out! The Lord is listening. He doesn’t need us to get the words right, or ask us to wait until we calm down to come before the throne. We can bring Him our snotty noses and ugly cries. He alone can transform them into peace and joy. \n\nIt was in the closet of desperation that I learned this: God is my provider, supernaturally changing my circumstances. And He is also my sustainer, supernaturally carrying me through those circumstances. Both are grace. Perhaps that’s why the psalmist made this declaration, even before his circumstances had shifted: \n\n“Cast your burden on the LORD, and He will sustain you” (v.22). \n\nWhen we hurl our burdens at Christ’s throne, without attempting to wrap them up in pretty bows, we find He is more than able to carry them. Today, whatever our circumstances, whatever is happening in the world around us, we can bring our desperation as an offering of faith, trusting He will get us through. His will, His love, and His justice will prevail.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 143:1-12\n\nA few years ago my husband and I were in the middle of an agonizing time of decision-making. He was unemployed, we had a mortgage to pay, we were in the midst of a difficult season where we felt alone as a brand new married couple in a new city, new church, and new job for me. On top of all that, there were some peripheral difficulties clouding our judgment. It was one of those times in life where I felt completely alone and as though any decision we might make would have catastrophic results. Our circumstances weren’t even at their worst yet, but even at that point, we felt paralyzed in the midst of indecision. No direction seemed right or good or sufficient or joyful or enough for anyone else, let alone us. \n\nIt was in the midst of this indecision that one of us read these words from pastor and author Scotty Smith: \n\nGrant us peace as we make important decisions. Some of us are facing career changes, church choices, economic challenges, and health issues. Free us from the foolish notion that there is only one right choice to make. Actually, there is only one right God to trust, and that is you. Lead us, as we lean on you, Father.\n\nThis quote nudged something in us both, and it is the same nudging I feel when I read Psalm 143:8:\n\nLet me hear in the morning of your steadfast love,\n\nfor in you I trust.\n\nMake me know the way I should go,\n\nfor to you I lift up my soul.\n\nSo often we are duped into believing there is only one right decision in front of us. When the way seems cloudy, as it often does, we can find ourselves paralyzed with the fear that we’ll make the wrong decision. But this psalm of David shows us the way. It is a compass for directional purposes: Let me hear your steadfast love. In you I trust. To you I lift up my soul. \n\nWhere do I look when I don’t know where to look? To Him. To His love, His trustworthiness, His help. It is the only place my soul will find rest, the only trustworthy place, and the only love that will not let me go. \n\nWhat decisions are you facing today? What needs to be done or said or moved or broken or taken up? What opinions or thoughts or fears or refrains are you replaying over and over again in your mind? What closed doors or open doors do you see? Now, lift up your eyes, lift up your soul, and see your Maker, your God, your friend, your Savior. If He is your truest north, and serving Him, being loved by Him, and obeying Him is your greatest good, then take a step. Then another. And another. We may never know the direction life is taking us, but we can know the God who keeps us and guides us on the way He is leading us.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer for Help in Trouble",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 142:1-7\n\nWe are not a people fond of showcasing our flaws and failures. So much of our society is meant to elevate our best selves. But no matter how long we drink from the fountain of “you have what it takes” ideology, our frailty remains a bitter pill that cannot be swallowed. \n\nThen we open our Bibles and see an entirely different approach. Prayer is not the place for pep talks or public relations. Unlike social media posts, the purpose of prayer is not to put ourselves in the best light and convince God we are good so that He will respond. Rather, prayer is the place where we admit we are weak and needy, an invitation to confess we are utterly lost in the face of trouble without the sovereign hand of God. \n\nDavid didn’t write Psalm 142 from his palace, surrounded by adoring fans. This isn’t a psalm penned after a military victory or personal triumph. This psalm is a prayer, written from a cave, a crude place of refuge, by a man on the run. \n\nIt’s not clear if these words were penned from the cave of Adullam or En-gedi, two places we find David hiding as he fled from the paranoia of King Saul (1 Samuel 22, 1 Samuel 24). In both circumstances his leader and mentor had vowed to kill him and had the resources and resolve to carry it out. David was a sitting duck who knew he could not defend himself. His enemies were armed and dangerous and David had nothing but desperation. Remarkably, he didn’t try to spin the story. When trouble surrounded him and pressed his back up against the cave wall, David declared his frailty to the Lord: \n\nListen to my cry,\n\nfor I am very weak.\n\nRescue me from those who pursue me,\n\nfor they are too strong for me.\n\n—Psalm 142:6\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons why God described David as “a man after my heart” was David’s willingness to own up to his desperation for God’s help (Acts 13:22). I read through God’s Word and cannot help but see a pattern: God is near in our trouble. \n\nWhen faced with a battle he was too weak to win, Jehoshaphat declared, “We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you” and God secured the victory (2 Chronicles 20:12). \n\nDaniel was powerless to shut the lions’ mouths, so he “implored God” to do it for him. God did (Daniel 6:11). \n\nPaul begged the Lord to take away his weakness. In response the Spirit reminded him, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9).  \n\nWeakness is power because in our weakness, we are made strong by God. In the age of spin, I need to be reminded that even weak faith is productive, even feeble prayers are answered (Matthew 17:20). Prayer is an invitation to come as we really are and hear from the God who loves us anyway. \n\nWe each have our own enemies to face and battles we cannot win. Sure, we could try to puff ourselves up with false bravado, but the illusion of our strength is easily exposed. There is an alternative to sinking into despair and defeat. When this world brings trouble to our doorstep, we can look to the Lord for comfort and wait with open hands to receive His strength.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer of Adoration",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 146:1-10\n\nEverything I need to know about earthly adoration, I learned from my middle school musical theater class. First, we learned through experience. What else is a brace-faced preteen supposed to feel upon receiving a standing ovation for her impeccably off-key version of Oliver! The Musical’s “Food Glorious Food”? For all I knew, applause and attention meant the same thing as adoration.\n\nThen, we learned from the music. One of the delightfully cheesy and romantic tunes that stands out the most is Aretha Franklin’s “I Say A Little Prayer,” which is also included on the soundtrack for the film My Best Friend’s Wedding, starring a young Julia Roberts. Perhaps you remember the chorus:\n\nForever, forever, you’ll stay in my heart\n\nAnd I will love you\n\nForever and ever, we never will part\n\nOh, how I’ll love you\n\nTogether, together, that’s how it must be\n\nTo live without you\n\nWould only be a heartbreak for me.\n\nThese were lyrics that made even prepubescent girls swoon. During rehearsals, we’d stand squished on the risers, divided into altos and sopranos, as our choral director clapped the rhythms and contorted his face into exaggerated expressions, commanding us to annunciate! “FOR-EV-ER, FOR-EV-ER,” he would chant.\n\nIt’s no coincidence that this is what we long for. We want the affection we receive to be sure, and the praise we give to remain warranted—not just one-time applause. Commitment and adoration go hand in hand, and with God, we get both.\n\nHere is where the romantic comedy cliches and the middle school dramatics stop. Adoration is not intended to be a general concept that God calls for early on and then forgets about. Rather, adoration is something we see carried throughout the psalms as a rhythmic refrain to God’s presence and nearness to us. Psalm 146 recalls reasons for adoring God: He frees prisoners, opens the eyes of the blind, raises up the oppressed, loves the righteous, and protects resident aliens. \n\nAdoration is the response we give to our God who is good and faithful in all things. It is the deep abiding love that only comes from the safety of a covenant made by a promise-keeping God who loves His children. It is His reason for choosing us, and our reason for returning to Him. He wants to adore us as His own for eternity, and because of that, we get to return and enjoy His love forever.\n\nGod remains faithful forever. (FOR-EV-ER!) His kingdom and promises and love for us will stand firm into eternity. May we learn to love and adore Him in return.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer for the Church",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 84:1-12\n\nI learned how to drive on the interstate that we took to get to church every Sunday. My parents forced me to drive on that busy road because they knew I would have to drive it many, many times over the next few years while I lived in Birmingham. My family was in that building every time the doors were open. Sunday school, Sunday morning worship, Sunday evening worship, Wednesday evening Bible class—you name it, we were there sitting on the front row. \n\nWhile I was growing up, church always felt a little bit like something I had to check off a to-do list. I never spent the night at friends’ houses on Saturday night because I had to go to church in the morning. I would always rush home from sports practices on Wednesdays so I could make it to youth group on time. I loved church, yes, but it never felt like the kind of church the psalmist is describing in Psalm 84.\n\nWhen I was in college, I spent a semester in Santiago, Chile, and for three months, I didn’t go to church, not really. I didn’t speak much Spanish at the time, and so when I did attend church there, I spent more time and energy trying to translate the sermon in my head than just worshiping. While I was in Chile, church began to take on a completely different meaning than it did when I was a child.\n\nOver the course of a few months, the idea of “church” shifted to “Church.” The distinction of the capital “C” allowed me to view the Church as a larger being, as something other than just the place I went to worship. The Church is so much more than the small box in which I’d stowed my idea of our local church. It is family, community, a safe place to worship and experience the presence of our God.\n\nEven a sparrow finds a home,\n\nand a swallow, a nest for herself\n\nwhere she places her young—\n\nnear your altars, LORD of Armies,\n\nmy King and my God.\n\nHow happy are those who reside in your house,\n\nwho praise you continually.    Selah.\n\n—Psalm 84:3-4\n\n Let us use Psalm 84 as a means of pleading with God for what we want His Kingdom to look like here, now. May we be a people and a Church that reside in the house of our Lord, a people who praise Him continually. May we allow the Church to be a safe place for outsiders, a home for those who are lost, and a family for the broken. And may we pray for the Church be a place that bridges the gap between heaven and earth, where we meet with our God and enjoy His presence together, as a community.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 2:1-12\n\nI like to be the first one awake at my house. However, I don’t like to set an alarm clock because of my dedication to the mysterious idea of sleep cycles. So instead, I play a pillow-cushioned game of Russian roulette every morning. When my body needs more sleep, I let the old girl sleep. But sometimes it all works out so that I have this gorgeous window of time—typing, planning, organizing—setting the stage for the day ahead before anyone else is awake.\n\nOne morning I was up at 5 a.m., feeling strong. I filled my arms full of things I wanted to carry into the kitchen: cups from last night, my phone, a clipboard, my little portable speaker, and a few rolls of washi tape ringed around my thumb. Juggling all of this in the dark, I preemptively nudged my phone to start playing some quiet piano music, because it usually takes a while to load. \n\nBut here are a couple things I didn’t know: First, my phone was already linked to the portable speaker. And second, everything was set at full volume. (Oh, and one thing you didn’t know: there were nine other people, too, sleeping nearby.) So in the pre-dawn light, on my way to some quiet, productive time in the kitchen, I found myself in the middle of the house, my arms uncomfortably full, clutching a speaker that was inexplicably bellowing the climax from Handel’s Messiah: “WOR-THY IS THE LAMB, THAT WAS SLAIN!”\n\nI circled around like a toy car, fumbling to turn the music off in the dark, and somehow succeeded in making the volume louder still—probably because my eyes were mostly squinted shut from laughing. And since you can’t shush a speaker, it took me a while to get quiet again.\n\nI think we sometimes want to keep Jesus in a little quiet box too. The title of today’s reading is “A Prayer Celebrating the Gift of Jesus,” and honestly, I’d expected to be writing about a sweet Christmas baby Jesus as our joy to the world. But this psalm is about the almighty dominion of Christ. He did come as a baby, yes, but He is also the omnipotent King of kings.\n\nThe psalmist calls us to “serve the Lord with reverential awe, and rejoice with trembling” (Psalm 2:11). He is a God we cannot control and cannot fully comprehend. Our proper response is to worship Him. It’s easier to think of Jesus as our pocket-sized best friend, but we need to remember that He rules and reigns the cosmos. He is a paradox, making His love for us all the more potent. We must pay Him homage, for He is our King, and all who take refuge in Him are happy.\n\nThis paradox is a beautiful and central tenet of our faith: “kiss the Son, lest He be angry” (v.12). Our God comes low to love mankind, but He remains just and unchanging, righteous and holy. We are sloppy and funny and sneaky. His love for His wishy-washy creation is so wonderful, but it doesn’t change who He is; who He has always been—the King of all creation. So we worship at the feet of this mystery we cannot control. And we celebrate the gift of Jesus, both as a baby and as King.\n\n",

To get to the heart of Jesus’ parables, we need to pull them apart and take a careful look at the details He gives us. One detail that runs through this week’s selection of parables is that Jesus says they all describe the kingdom of God in some way. As you read through these passages, use the following questions to unpack the stories Jesus tells.\n\n//\n\nDay 5 Reading: Matthew 25:1-13, Mark 13:32-37, Luke 12:35-48\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. In Luke’s parable about the master’s return, who are the characters in the story and who do they represent?\n\n2. What issue does this particular parable address, and what is the outcome of the story?\n\n3. What is the central point of this parable?\n\n4. What, if anything, do you find particularly difficult to understand about this parable? What about it seems clear? What is your response to it?\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 4:23-7:29\n\nCan you think back to a moment when your wrong actions or motivations were exposed? When the dark corners of your heart were revealed, and even you stood surprised at the depth of your flaws?\n\nI am remembering a time recently when my sin was laid bare. I failed to consider others before myself, and I acted in a way contrary to what I know to be true. It was not all intentional, but it was all me. I felt embarrassed. I felt sad. I felt distraught at my helplessness to rewind the situation and make it better. \n\nImagine with me a version of this scenario where the one who reveals your wrongdoing also offers the remedy for it. He says to you, “Here is what you’ve done, and here is how it violated God and others. You are deeply flawed. But you are also deeply loved. You are not wholly righteous, but I am. You can not live up to every line of the law, but I have. You are not enough, but I was and I am and I will be—on your behalf. Your life is now hidden in mine.”\n\nIn the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus’ longest recorded sermon and arguably His most well-known, Jesus holds the lives and religion of His hearers up to the light of God’s law. It is as if He takes a spiritual X-ray of their actions, hearts, motives, and rituals, as well as their pain, longings, confusion, and suffering. Reading this sermon should do the same to ours. \n\nThe prognosis is bleak: we are broken beyond self-repair. But the remedy is real: Jesus came to fulfill every inch of the law on our behalf. \n\nMuch to the shock of His listeners, Jesus taught that the kingdom of heaven is utterly unlike our earthly kingdoms. The poor and afflicted—not the powerful and attractive—are called blessed, along with the grieving, the seeking, and the persecuted. The the true measure of a person is not just her action, but her heart. Authentic spirituality is reflected not by how loudly we worship in public, but how earnestly we worship in private. Jesus, in effect, says this: You tout the law even as you break the law, but I alone fulfill the law. I alone am enough. \n\nBecause of the person and work of Christ, the law gives freedom instead of chains, life instead of despair. Rather than dwelling in condemnation or striving in vain for our own righteousness, a proper view of God’s law directs our gaze to Jesus. Seeing God’s law as both holy and wholly fulfilled in Jesus compels us to live out of Christ’s love for us in all areas of life. \n\nAs we read the Sermon on the Mount, we will feel the sting of Christ’s rebuke of sin and self. The dark corners of our hearts will be exposed, and we may wince at what we find there. But we will also hear the invitation to new life. There is peace in relying solely on Christ’s perfection and goodness. There is freedom in living our lives on earth as citizens of our truer, everlasting kingdom: the kingdom of God. \n\nThis is the life we were made for. This is the life that is ours in Jesus.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Beatitudes",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:1-12, Psalm 69:29-33, Isaiah 61:1-3, 1 Timothy 6:11-16\n\nLike many of you, I have spent the last week glued to the news about Hurricane Harvey. I live about two hours west of Houston and have been unable to wrap my mind around the devastation.\n\nI was texting with a Houston friend yesterday, checking in to see how her neighborhood is faring. She and her family are okay, but she knows many who are not. While volunteering at an evacuee shelter, she noticed how exhausted many of the mothers looked. They had been sleeping in large rooms, on cots with multiple kids, babies, and families around. So my friend had the idea to set up a night nursery. She and other volunteers would take the nightshift, watching the small children and babies in one room, so tired moms could sleep in another. \n\nTaking the night shift means nobody will see her volunteering, except for the babies whose diapers she will be changing, who she’ll sing lullabies to and rock to sleep. It is the opposite of glamorous work, but it is the exact definition of kingdom work. Quiet, unseen, faithful. \n\nIn theory, I love the Beatitudes. I love the way Jesus turned expectations upside down when describing who would inherit the kingdom of God and how. In practice, however, I live by a different set of attitudes. \n\nBlessed are the poor in spirit? How about blessed is she who depends on herself for her own needs? She will go far in life, never relying on others.\n\nBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness? How about blessed is she who hungers and thirsts for more social media followers? She will increase her platform.\n\nBlessed are the peacemakers? How about blessed is she who is always right in an argument? She will be called “the winner.” \n\nBlessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake? How about blessed is she who does whatever she can to maintain her comfort? She will be… comfortable. \n\nWhen I really look at my heart, I find these are my true attitudes, the place from which I live my life. I am individualistic, out for my own glory, trying to save face, and hesitant to step outside my own zone of comfort. \n\nThere is nothing like seeing your friend step up to take the night shift during a natural disaster to put your own heart in check. It forces me to ask, What am I seeking? My own glory or His? Who am I looking to for approval? Others or the Father?\n\nJesus entered into our world in an unexpected way. He wore no crown. He had no throne. He simply got to work. He took the night shift. He healed and performed miracles, as the Pharisees looked on and judged. He spoke truth even when His disciples abandoned Him because of it. And He died on a cross as Roman soldiers scoffed at the sign they placed above His head: King of the Jews.\n\nJesus turned it all upside down—the way we thought the King would come and the way we thought we could secure a seat at His table. \n\nWe want to be big fancy warriors standing by His side. But His command to us is to fall back in the ranks and tend to those who have fallen. To kneel down low, as He did for us. To take the night shift and “be glad and rejoice, because [our] reward is great in heaven” (Matthew 5:12). We may never receive a medal or a trophy for our work, but we have already received the greatest reward of them all: eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 49:5-6, Luke 14:25-35, John 9:5, Colossians 4:2-6\n\nSalt and light. Some of us have heard these faith metaphors since childhood, maybe even sung them.\n\nThis little light of mine,\n\nI’m gonna let it shine.\n\n Christ followers are salt and light to the world. Jesus says so. So why not “let it shine” like the song says? If light dispels darkness, shouldn’t we hold it up as high and bright as we know how? \n\nHide it under a bushel? No!\n\nI’m gonna let it shine.\n\n“Let your light shine before others,” Jesus says (Matthew 5:16). But a little while later, in this very same sermon, He instructs believers not to flaunt their faith, as the Pharisees were apt to do. Don’t fast so that other people notice; don’t pray loud so that others will hear, He says (Matthew 6:6, 16-18). How then, are we to understand Jesus’ declaration that we are people who should stand out and lend flavor, simply by nature of following Him?\n\nTensions like this are not my favorite. I like to know what is expected of me so I can meet those expectations, or at least do my best to fly under the radar when I don’t. But no matter how many times I reread these verses from Matthew 5, I can’t find where Jesus gives a measurement for how much salt is too much, or a guide for how brightly our light should shine. Even worse, I can’t find a list of practical examples of how to be salt and light in my 21st century American life. \n\nIt sounds silly, but isn’t that too often how we approach Scripture? I confess that I do. I read it looking for me instead of Him. \n\nThe Sermon on the Mount, like all of Jesus’ teaching, offers more than a moral checklist. Jesus addresses the heart behind our action, the motivation behind our direction. His is not a get-it-right gospel of personal achievement, not a formula to memorize. It is relationship. The how-tos are not there because they are not the point: Jesus is the point.\n\nSaltiness and brightness are not qualities that salt and light determine about themselves. They are qualities determined by their Maker. Their purpose is placed within them, not one they muster up. Likewise, being “the salt of the earth” and “the light of the world” is not something we accomplish by sheer will; it is who we are when we are made new in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). \n\n“I will also make you a light for the nations,\n\nto be my salvation to the ends of the earth.”\n\n– Isaiah 49:6\n\nIn the same way that salt changes the taste of a meal, or light alters the composition of a room, our redeemed lives in Christ are a way that God, in His good providence, chooses to affect the world around us. We are walking, talking testaments of God’s mercy and grace in a dying world. We are salt and light because He makes us so.\n\nThe art of living and loving in a way that stands out in a fallen world is a matter of knowing and following Jesus. When we are in relationship with Him, the light we shine is His light. The flavor we bring to the world around us tastes distinctly like the hope and joy of His gospel. \n\nAs we read Christ’s words today, may we be drawn less to grand feats of faith and more to the everyday outflow of a life lived in prayer, Scripture, repentance, and obedience to the Lord. May we embrace “the mystery of Christ” that Paul spoke to the Colossians (4:3), and seek Him out in the tensions of our faith. After all, following Jesus is more art, less science. It’s not about following rules; it’s about following Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:17-20, Psalm 40:6-8, Hosea 6:6, Micah 6:8, Matthew 11:28-30, John 14:23-26\n\nWhen I was sixteen, I was not the sixteen of the movies. I expected that I would go to lots of parties and laugh with lots of boys. Instead, I did Bible quizzing. Do you know what this is? It’s amazing and intense. You basically memorize a book of the Bible and then meet up with other church kids and answer questions. There were even special seats that could sense when you stood up, since we were so quick to answer and the human eye could never have accurately detected who was the first up to “Complete the following verse: ‘Do not think that I have come to abolish…’”\n\nIn a flash I was up, “ThelawortheProphetsIhavenotcometoabolishthembuttofulfillthem!!!”\n\nThe year I quizzed, we memorized the book of Matthew. I was “Captain Bible Quizzing Nerd Pants.” I wish I had the motivation to memorize Scripture with the tenacity I did when I was sixteen. Back then I threw all my teenage energy into bookish and nerdy pursuits.\n\nThis is why the book of Matthew rings with the fervor of sixteen-year-old adrenaline for me. The whole book seemed SO IMPORTANT back then. This passage reminds me that the whole of Scripture is important: not just the parts we obsessed over as teenagers, not just the parts we like, and not just the racy bits in Song of Solomon.\n\nChrist fulfills the whole of Scripture. \n\nSome Jews, weary under the weight of the law, might have wished that Christ would totally abolish it. They, like me, might have wished they could just be free of the law to live as they liked. But the law of the Old Testament provides boundaries and a structure upon which to hang the grace Christ offers in the New Testament. \n\nImagine a playground high on a mountain. Now, try to stay calm, watching the kids climbing and swinging from up above. I know I would keep all my babies as close as possible, not letting them run because of my fear they would fall. Now imagine this mountain playground is surrounded by a sturdy fence. Suddenly there is freedom to play! The boundary gives freedom.\n\nThis is what Christ is saying: the law is excellent, and He fulfills it. If the law is a glass of water, Christ doesn’t pour it out, He fills it up for us. He doesn’t make the law void; He stamps it paid in full!\n\nOn the other hand, the Jews believed that anything belonging to God should be preserved—even the least of the commandments, which incidentally, they reckoned was found in Deuteronomy 22:6-7: If you find a bird’s nest, you can take the baby birds, but leave the mother bird (my paraphrase). These jots and tittles—they were the bread and butter of the Pharisees, the Super Law Followers. \n\nBut Christ does something truly amazing. He calls us to repent of both our sins AND our righteousness. Our “goodness” is not good enough, our righteousness is not righteous enough. Only Christ’s redemption is enough. The Pharisees obeyed the outside of the law, but we are called to obey the inside of the law, the truth, heart, and substance behind it. So go ahead and pay your tithe, but give God your heart.\n\nIt’s only when we realize that even our righteousness isn’t enough, that we can repent and trust ourselves to the righteousness of Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Murder Begins in the Heart",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:21-26, Genesis 4:1-16, Exodus 20:13, Psalm 14:1-3, Mark 11:23-25, James 2:8-13, 3:3-6\n\nGrowing up with two brothers meant a constant war of the wills. I wanted to watch Harriet the Spy and they wanted to watch Star Wars. I wanted to do crafts, and they wanted to play video games. It was the usual sibling conflict, but it provided our parents with many teachable moments. \n\nI still remember the awkwardness of learning to apologize. We would mutter “sorry” under our breath, but that didn’t cut it. Our parents would prompt us to say why we were sorry and then ask us to hug one another, no matter how forced it seemed. \n\nYou’d think all that practice at reconciliation would make it easier, but the truth is my first instinct is still to avoid conflict. I would much rather ignore the tension in my relationships and hope it disappears. So when I read Jesus’ words in the Gospel of Matthew, clearly stating we need to address and heal the grievances in our relationships if we are going to be in right relationship with God, I start to sweat a little. \n\nIn Matthew 5:21-26, we read the first of six discourses found in the Sermon on the Mount. Each begins with Jesus saying, “You have heard that it was said… But I tell you…” These six discourses are heavy hitters. Jesus greatly raised the bar of expectation on how His followers are meant to behave in regard to anger, purity, divorce, honesty, generosity, and love. Christ was showing that God requires righteousness that surpassed even that of the scribes and Pharisees. Who can possibly live up to this standard? No person other than Jesus Christ, of course. And so Jesus calls us to aim higher, but also to realize our need for His mercy and grace.\n\nThe new teaching Christ gave on murder said that even anger in the heart would be subject to judgment. While most of us can’t imagine committing murder, who hasn’t been angry or unkind toward another? In realizing that any hate in our heart is worthy of punishment, we can’t stand above the law and pretend we don’t need saving.\n\nWhat seems especially important in this passage is Christ’s command to get right with our brothers and sisters before we make our offering to the Lord. So often we want to ask God for forgiveness and leave it at that. But the Lord cares deeply about our broken relationships here on earth. Just as parents teach their children to apologize to siblings, our heavenly Father teaches us, His children, to reconcile with our brothers and sisters in Christ. \n\nWe are meant to be the family of God to one another, and being a healthy family means lovingly facing the pain, tension, and hurt encountered in true relationship. \n\nIt is the work of the Holy Spirit to reveal to us if “[our] brother or sister has something against [us].” (Perhaps you are thinking of someone now?) We are called to listen to this prompting and “go and be reconciled” as much as we are able. Some relationships may seem impossible to repair, but the Lord calls us to do our best to reconcile. Whether or not our attempts are accepted is not in our control.\n\nHowever difficult or broken our earthly relationships may be, we have the peace and presence of Jesus, just as He promised (John 14:26-27). He pursued us at our worst and gave His life so that we might experience the ultimate reconciliation—peace with God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:27-30, Exodus 20:14,17, Psalm 19:12-14, Jeremiah 17:9, Mark 9:43-48\n\nI became a Pharisee the day I dropped my phone in the toilet.\n\nI didn’t mean to, of course. Months prior, I’d signed my life away with paperwork acknowledging that water damage would not, under any circumstances, be covered by a protection plan. I happily checked the box, certain I would not, under any circumstances, be one of those people—the careless kind.\n\nBut I was. Suddenly, I wasn’t just dipping my toes in the idea of being that kind of person, I was nose-diving into full-fledged, card-carrying membership. To make matters worse, I kept it all a secret, appearing at the mobile phone help desk and looking like a victimized puppy. “What? Water? Never!” I gasped.\n\nAnd then they brought out the lie detector. Well, it was technically a test for water damage, but in this case, it was a ruthless, truth-gauging machine and I was forced to plead guilty.\n\nI didn’t ever think I’d be guilty of adultery, either. After all, I’m just a single twenty-something girl who blushed the whole way through this passage. I grew up in the church, envisioning this commandment from Jesus as the free space on my Salvation Bingo card.\n\nBut, like the Pharisees, I’m prone to forget that the thing God cares about most is our hearts. We don’t have to cheat on a romantic relationship to prove ourselves unfaithful to a faithful God. Sin is just another name for adultery of the heart, which means that most of the bad things we thought we’d never do, we’ve already done. We’re guilty. We’re those people.\n\nMatthew Henry points out that this passage not only forbids the act of adultery, but also the appetite for it and approach to it. He says “convenient opportunity” is the only difference between thinking about eating the forbidden fruit and actually eating it.\n\nSo, what are we supposed to do? Do we hide away from the world? How do we just stop sinning?\n\nThe heart is more deceitful than anything else,\n\nand incurable—who can understand it?\n\n– Jeremiah 17:9\n\nAt first glance, the answer we find in God’s Word may seem pretty disturbing. Mark 9 instructs us to cut off our hands and feet and gouge out our eyes when we even begin to think about sin. While it’s gross and painful to think about, Jesus uses this illustration not to punish us, but to show us the depth of sin we’ve been rescued from. He wants us to see that the life He calls us to live is actually impossible to achieve solely by our flesh. His rescue is not a convenience; it is a necessity. Saving our souls should have lost us everything else, but instead, we gain Him. \n\nWith this as Jesus’ standard, we can look to His covenant bride, the Church, with awe and admiration, knowing it has never even crossed His mind to leave her—to leave us. He loves us. He truly loves us.\n\nAll of the good things we knew we could not do, He’s already done. Praise the Lord.\n\n May the words of my mouth\n\nand the meditation of my heart\n\nbe acceptable to you,\n\nLord, my rock and my Redeemer.\n\n– Psalm 19:14\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:31-32, Genesis 2:20-25, Malachi 2:10-16, Matthew 19:1-12, 1 Corinthians 7:10-16\n\nLast night, my husband and I held hands as guests at a wedding. Outdoor summer weddings in the South are the epitome of idealistic thinking. As I enthusiastically fanned us both with a pink fan glued to a wooden stick, I thought about how ridiculous it was for us to be casually, affectionately holding hands at a time like this. Watching the fresh, glorious young bride and her awestruck groom make their vows in earnest to one another, I couldn’t help but think how the whole thing is just completely impossible. \n\nWe fall in love, and that love leads us to make wildly extravagant promises to each other. We promise, in our best clothes and in front of all our aunts and uncles, to “love, honor, and obey as long as we both shall live.” It is the bravest, most ridiculous promise I’ve ever made.\n\nHave I kept my wedding vows? Have you? Truly? Even before we drove off into the sunset I had broken my vows. My heart was full of love, but my soul was still inclined to offer my new husband selfishness and dishonor. We make extravagant promises we cannot keep, but that’s why marriage is a covenant we make first with God, and then with each other. God keeps His promises. He created marriage and designed it to last.\n\nI love marriage. I want to go even further than the Pharisees and say that “what God has joined together, let no man separate” (Matthew 19:6). I want no one to ever get divorced. But this is exactly what the Sermon on the Mount is all about. It’s rubber-meets-the road Christianity. And when the rubber meets the road, sometimes people have to get divorced. When the Pharisees ask about the conditions for divorce, they are, as per usual, trying to see how high they can draw the water line to measure who was right and who was wrong. And Jesus gives them “sexual immorality” as the only possible grounds.\n\nBut the grounds for marriage and the grounds for divorce aren’t to be our chief focus here. Christ Himself is the center of our covenant vows. When the Apostle Paul speaks of marriage, he says, “I am speaking of Christ and the church” (Ephesians 5:32). This means that marriage doesn’t exist apart from Christ. To ignore Christ in any consideration, either of marriage or divorce, is peril and destruction. Whether sin bears its ugly fruit in divorce, or grace intervenes to reconcile, these things must all be laid at the feet of Christ the faithful.\n\nWhether it’s our parents, our siblings, our friends, or our own marriage—divorce has touched all of us in some way. The truth is, marriage doesn’t always work out. Even Moses made provision for divorce (Matthew 19:8). But when the Pharisees asked Jesus about divorce, they were thinking of marriage in strictly human terms; therefore, they also thought of divorce in merely pragmatic, human terms.\n\nThe things we think about at a wedding are exactly the things we should think about at a divorce. Yes, the world is a broken place, and we are broken people. But our brokenness is not the final standard for marriage or divorce. The extravagant promises of a wedding day are secured for us, not in our own strength, but in Christ. Both the making and the keeping of vows are only possible by His sustaining grace. And, knowing His faithfulness, we can have confidence, despite our folly.\n\nAnd that’s why we keep engaging in this impossible mystery of marriage. God made us for love. He gave us marriage to make us holy, and to teach us about Himself. And that’s why we keep doing crazy things like getting married outdoors in the south in the summer. \n\nMarriage isn’t about us. It’s about Him. He is the one who keeps vows.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:33-37, Exodus 20:7, Ecclesiastes 5:4-7, Matthew 26:62-64, James 5:12\n\nI should be walking around with a needle in my eye. Maybe you should too. \n\nThat visual might make us cringe, but a touch of squeamishness is just what we need to really hear Jesus’ words recorded in Matthew 5:33-37. Sandwiched in the middle of hard-to-digest teachings on divorce and loving our enemies, Jesus calls out our long track record of broken promises. \n\n“Cross my heart. Hope to die. Stick a needle in my eye.” Remember saying that as a kid? As we vowed to be BFFs with our playmates or to tell the truth in a given situation, we may have crossed our hearts with our little fingers, but we didn’t really hope to die. We certainly didn’t expect someone to stick a needle in our eye if the promise was forgotten or broken. \n\nWith all of the conviction our hearts could muster, we made a vow we couldn’t keep. It’s a habit we likely haven’t grown out of entirely, and one that is not new to Christ’s followers. The practical takeaway of this mini-sermon on vows is simple, though certainly not easy. I can’t say it better than Christ, so I won’t attempt to. \n\n“But let your ‘yes’ mean ‘yes,’ and your ‘no’ mean ‘no.’ Anything more than this is from the evil one.”\n\n– Matthew 5:37\n\nIn a world where words are cheap and promises are disposable, we are called to be promise keepers, a people who faithfully follow through. If we say we will do something, we ought to show up and do it. If we aren’t sure we can, we should ask the Holy Spirit to help us decline or stay quiet. \n\nThere are a zillion practical applications of this truth, but just using these words as a guide to manage our calendars and commitments is the lower-hanging, easy-to-pick fruit. Let’s look up and see the gospel. \n\nThe Old Testament is packed with followers who made dramatic vows to the Lord:\n\nJacob vowed to worship Yahweh and tithe a tenth of his belongings if God would meet his physical needs (Genesis 28:20-22).\n\nSamson’s parents made a vow on his behalf, promising to never cut his hair (Judges 13:5).\n\nHannah vowed to send her firstborn son to live in the temple if God would give her the baby she longed for (1 Samuel 1:10-11).\n\nJonah attempted to use a vow to pry open the mouth of the huge fish that swallowed him (Jonah 2:9).\n\nDavid vowed not to sleep until he built a temple for the ark of the covenant (Psalm 132:2-5).\n\n\n\nThe people on this list kept their promises imperfectly or not at all, just like we do. They may have followed through on one specific vow, but each of them failed at keeping their promise to worship God alone and to obey Him perfectly. We’ve followed suit by promising to love, serve, worship, and obey out of one corner of our mouths, while sinning out of the other corner. But we should not get used to this. Breaking promises to God, and to others, should always make us squirm. Even more, it should cause us to repent and look to Jesus.\n\nOur imperfections highlight and point to Christ’s perfection. He is the ultimate and only promise keeper. Despite our trail of broken promises, God has not reneged on His promise to save us and free us from sin, to bring us back into relationship with Him. This is the gospel, isn’t it? \n\nWe can say what we mean and mean what we say because we bear His image. More importantly we can be constantly buoyed by the hope that God will keep every promise He’s ever made to us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:38-42, Exodus 21:23-25, Exodus 22:26-27, Romans 13:1-4, 1 Peter 2:21-23\n\nYou’ve probably felt like a doormat at times. I have too. Worn out, overlooked, stepped on, stepped over, left outside, dirtied, and eventually discarded. I’ve felt it in friendships and in family and in my own home. I’ve felt it in conversations and invitations and misinterpretations. I’ve felt it in my own heart and had it confirmed by others when they didn’t know I could hear. \n\nMy temptation is to stand straighter, hold my head higher, and if I’m honest, to sometimes do it right back. Forget to invite. Overlook. Walk past. Not consider. I want to give like in return for like, an eye for an eye, as Jesus said was the norm in Matthew 5:38. This is a human reaction to a human condition; we’re all trading eyes without ever really seeing anything at all. But Jesus wanted to show us another way: \n\n“If anyone slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. As for the one who wants to sue you and take away your shirt, let him have your coat as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two. Give to the one who asks you, and don’t turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you” (Matthew 5:39-42).\n\nIn other words, don’t trade eyes for eyes, giving like for like; instead, take the exchange out entirely: Give and turn, then let go. Jesus is essentially telling us to turn our palms up, shoulder the weight we’re not meant to carry, and walk on, going with them for an extra mile. We ought to out-give, out-do, out-serve, and in doing so, bring honor and glory to Him. \n\nWe’ve all felt like the doormat, felt the rub of dirty feet across our backs, a by-way for others to step over in their entrance to the feast. But then I think of sweet Jesus, lifting the feet of the disciples—dirty, sore, broken, smelly feet—and washing them with His own hands. The Savior of the world holding the feet of users and walkers and blind men who thought they could see, and washing them, making them clean. \n\nWe are not the Savior. We cannot make clean what is unclean, but we can turn our cheeks, anticipating the sting of a broken person’s hand. We can anticipate the swindler, coming to take us for all we’re worth, and give them everything, saying our worth is wrapped up in Christ and not what we own. We can walk not one mile, but two, knowing it takes longer than a mile to long-suffer with someone, finding in the second mile that we are no longer enemies, but friends. And we can give instead of withhold, forgive instead of demanding repayment. \n\nI know the world may see us as doormats still—used, reused, walked over, and forgotten. But with our eyes fixed on Jesus, rather than on judging others, we will see something far better and more glorious than revenge: Christ, who became nothing, obedient to death, even death on a cross, so that we might walk miles and miles and miles with Him, both in this life and in the next.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Love Your Enemies",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:43-48, Leviticus 19:18, Deuteronomy 6:5, Matthew 22:34-40, Luke 6:36, Romans 12:9-21, 1 John 3:18\n\nIf you don’t have an enemy, you’ve probably never lived in the South during football season. When you declare devotion to a specific team or conference—or in my case, if this affection is delicately handed to you by a long, never-to-be broken-or-else lineage of family fans—you inherit the cheers, the players, the colors, the mascot, and of course, the rivals. You cannot root for one team without rooting against another.\n\nAlthough I did not choose the college my family cheers for, I did choose to root against their rival school, so I could still show up to Thanksgiving dinner without remorse. When it was time for my brother to choose a college, however, he asked me to sit down and brace myself for bad news. Using a poster board and pre-written speech, he told me something I never thought I’d hear from my own flesh and blood: he had chosen to attend our family’s rival school. He had chosen to become my enemy. Suddenly, game days consisted of watching the game in separate rooms and raising a flag above our childhood home which read, “House Divided.”\n\nOther than the fun and games of college football, I try really hard to be liked, and therefore, don’t have many “enemies.” And since I can’t name them, I don’t have to worry about loving them, right? But Jesus doesn’t ask us whether or not we have enemies. He does not give us qualifiers like, “If you have enemies… ” or “During football season…” Rather, He assumes we do have enemies and tells us to love them. \n\nWhat if our reluctance to admit to having enemies is standing in the way of God working through us to bring Him glory? What if our “goodness” and pride are blocking the flow of His true goodness in our relationships? We must stop avoiding the fact that we have enemies and get to the hard, kingdom-building work of loving them.\n\nIn Matthew 5:43-48, Jesus clarifies a way of following Him that goes above and beyond the law:\n\n“You have heard that it was said, Love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven.”\n\n– Matthew 5:43-45\n\nGulp. Okay, so maybe I have a few enemies—and not just of the sports variety. But loving my enemies in my own strength looks like the half-hearted lineup at the end of a football field, exchanging handshakes and “good games,” then ducking out to head for the locker room.\n\nBut loving people the way Jesus taught means praying for them, and prayer requires more than a half-hearted intention. Prayer requires truly wanting good for someone else. Because Jesus did not settle for anything less than redemption in His love for us, we must do the same for each other. \n\nI don’t think the point is to love our enemies until they stop being our enemies; I think it’s to experience God doling out grace in equal proportion alongside them in community. This serves as a reminder that if it weren’t for Jesus, we would all be eternal enemies of His and of one another.\n\nThere is no reason to keep score in our relationships. The Victor has already won. This means we no longer count someone else’s gain our loss, or vice versa, because Jesus is ours, and He is all we’ll ever need. \n\nPraise the Lord, our constant companion, for His love. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:1-4, Proverbs 24:12, 1 Corinthians 13:1-3, 2 Thessalonians 1:5-10, 1 John 2:28-29\n\nIn the 1960s, an innovative surgeon began work on a procedure that would separate the right and left hemispheres of the brain in order to stop seizures in patients with epilepsy. They called it the “split brain” surgery. It was a desperate measure—a last resort. The idea was to keep seizures originating on one side of the brain from spreading to the other side. \n\nBut cutting one side of the brain off from the other had some powerful and strange side effects, like one side of the body working independently of the other, not necessarily responsive to the will of the person inhabiting it. Instead of working as a seamless whole, it was as if one side didn’t know the other.\n\nI wonder if this violence to the brain is the only way for the left hand not to know what the right hand is doing. My left and right hands are best friends. When righty donates money to a good cause, lefty is already standing by for the high five. In Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, He is showing us what it really looks like to be a Christian. And when it comes to our own righteousness, He makes it clear that both hands, intertwined, are guilty of selfishness.\n\nEven more than we love to know others, we love to be known. We go to great lengths to make sure people know us, or at least know our good side. This is the problem Jesus was getting at in today’s passage: Have any of us have ever acted purely for the sake of others, with no thought of our own reputation? It’s a terrible thought, when you really parce out your motivation for one specific good action.\n\nPerhaps at our best moments, we have forgotten ourselves, given of ourselves freely, asked nothing in return. But if your heart is like mine, I can still recollect these moments of selfless triumph and try to cash them in for glory after the fact. Even at our best, we act from mixed motives. If we don’t get at least a little recognition, a simple thank you, or a smile in return, we feel slighted. But Jesus says that if we’re getting applause from others, then we already have our reward. He cautions us to humbly give in secret—so much so, that our left hand won’t have any idea what the right hand is doing (Matthew 6:1-3).\n\nThere’s no tally sheet. Our good deeds won’t be weighed against our bad deeds on a shining celestial scale because there’s no scale. There is only Jesus Christ, who writes our names in the book of life (Revelation 20:15; Luke 10:20). The ledger is stamped with Christ’s name, and when my life is counted, His righteousness is the only thing in view.\n\nThis can easily tempt me to clasp my hands behind my head, lean back, accept His grace, and give up worrying about good or bad actions all together. But both extremes of law and grace miss the mark. God is love, and He has filled us up with His love; therefore, our response is now to love in turn. We do good things because it is the only sane response to all the love that has been given to us. We do good things because our hearts are delighted by our heavenly Father. We do good things because we have learned to rejoice in giving rather than getting.\n\nLet your right and your left hand work with diligence at doing what is good and right. Rest in the safety of His atoning love. Pour out the love that He has given you to others, because God is love, and there will always be more.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:5-8, 2 Kings 4:32-37, Isaiah 26:20, Matthew 26:36-46, Mark 1:35-38, Luke 18:9-14\n\nMy copy of C.S. Lewis’ The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe smells like hot asphalt and recess kickball. With grass stains and dog-eared pages, the book was on my third grade required reading list, but my time spent feasting on the adventures of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy was anything but forced. I spent every moment I could nose-deep in its chapters, only looking up from the playground outfield if my name was called out (at least twice), or if my face was hit with a ball (just once).\n\nThe most tattered and beloved pages of that book are in the beginning chapters—before the lion or the witch are even introduced. It’s the wardrobe that got me. Lucy, the youngest, is the first to wander into her uncle’s neglected spare room and open the wardrobe doors, finding the forest dreamland of Narnia just beyond them. One of my favorite lines is easy to miss, because it’s just before she steps foot into the newly discovered world:\n\n“She did not shut [the wardrobe door] properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.”\n\nWe are hesitant to close the door on the world we love, even when an even better one awaits us. Even the most adventurous child is hesitant to explore in secret. But in teaching us how to pray, Jesus says to “go into your private room, shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret” (Matthew 6:6). He instructs us to approach the Lord from a secret place, unlike the hypocrites who stand on the street corners yelling for their Father. Isaac left for a field, Christ retreated to a mountain, Peter went to a rooftop.\n\nWhile this is a great warning against hypocrisy, these actions point us more toward the realm we enter into with prayer than the world we leave behind when we retreat—and it’s way better than Narnia. Prayer is the place where we do our most God-honoring work. Alone with Christ is where we remember that we can trust in Him alone.\n\nIt’s not that our Father doesn’t want others to know we’re talking to Him; it’s that He wants us to know who He is apart from others and the distractions of this world. We must intentionally and physically practice that truth that He is always near—we are never alone. If we don’t make a point to to “go away” from the world and pray, we will miss this. If Lucy had stood outside the wardrobe speculating about the possibility of Narnia, she and her siblings would have been left, as the book describes, “always in winter but never Christmas.”\n\nThe world is loud and familiar, but it does not see us and know us the way Jesus does. He is better, and He waits to meet with us in the secret places of our hearts that are not secret to Him. \n\nHeavenly Father, we confess it is difficult to close the door to a noisy world. But You alone know and offer what we really need. Teach us how to pray when we don’t know where to start. Help us to form words that are vulnerable and true, for they bring You glory. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:9-15, Proverbs 30:8, Luke 11:2-4, James 1:13-15, 1 Peter 1:3-9\n\nIf we stacked the books, commentaries, and sermons that have been written about the Lord’s Prayer together, we might be able to build a bridge long enough to get us to the hillside where Christ first taught us how to pray. Our fascination with this segment of the Sermon on the Mount seems surprisingly obvious: \n\nWe don’t know how to pray. \n\nI’ve been a follower of Christ for more than two decades. By God’s grace, I’ve grown leaps and bounds in my understanding of His Word and my grasp of my role in the Body of Christ. But when it comes to prayer, I still get the feeling that I’m somehow doing it wrong. Turns out, I’m in good company.  \n\nIt was after the Sermon on the Mount that the disciples begged, “Lord, teach us to pray” (Luke 11:1). Jesus patiently repeated the model He’d already given them. Even if we’ve read, meditated on, and listened to commentary about the Lord’s Prayer a zillion times, Jesus’ words remain worth considering. (Take a moment to look at them again now in Matthew 6:9-13.) When my own prayers feel clunky or inefficient, these words of Jesus’ jog my memory about a few things. \n\nFirst, prayer is not solely about me and my desires. It is first and foremost about God and His glory. If we rewind the Sermon on the Mount tapes just a smidge, we see that before Jesus taught us how to pray, He taught us how not to. He warned us not to pray fancy words in the hopes of being applauded by an audience of onlookers (Matthew 6:1-6). Prayer is not a tool we can use to bend the spotlight toward ourselves. Instead, Jesus’ model prayer opens with a list of “yours” that focus on the Father: \n\nHallowed be your name.\n\nYour kingdom come.\n\nYour will be done.\n\nMy prayers get off course because too often my heart is postured to think about my reputation, my little kingdom, and how I can convince God that my will needs to be done. But those things don’t get kicked to the curb entirely. The second half of the Lord’s prayer pivots to “us” beautifully. \n\nGive us this day our daily bread.\n\nForgive us our debts.\n\nLead us not into temptation.\n\nDeliver us from evil.\n\nOf the seven petitions given in the Lord’s Prayer, three are about God and four are about us. It’s the order of importance that is worth noting. God first, us second. It’s a pattern we should imitate in how we live, love, and pray. \n\nGoing over the Lord’s Prayer with a fine-toothed comb also reminds me that it’s okay to pray God’s words right back to Him. Many of Jesus’ words in the Lord’s Prayer nod to Old Testament passages and concepts (see 2 Chronicles 20:6; Proverbs 30:8; Psalm 71:4). Surely if the Word became flesh and quoted Himself, we can quote Him too. \n\nSince prayer is a conversation of the heart, the goal is not rote memorization. Isn’t it possible to say the same things over and over and still mean them deeply? I told my husband and children I loved them this morning at the breakfast table. It’s the same script I’ve been reading for years, and I mean it now more than ever. When we don’t know how to pray, we can pray God’s Word, confident it never loses an ounce of its power.\n\nFrom listeners on a hillside, to His disciples, to us, God invites us to lay down pretenses and performance and boldly approach Him through prayer. Lord, teach us to pray? Friends, He already has.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:16-18, 2 Samuel 12:15-23, Psalm 51:16-17, Isaiah 58:1-12, Revelation 19:6-10\n\nOne of my pet peeves is when people in public talk really loudly on purpose. Don’t get me wrong, I like loud and extroverted people in general, but the random strangers who want to be overheard irk me. Have you ever noticed someone talking about their awesome adventures, juicy gossip, or busy schedule, and it feels like they want you to hear every word? To know how cool or important they are? As I write this I’m sitting in a coffee shop next to a mighty loud cell phone talker. Deep breaths.\n\nIn my work as a counselor, I’ve learned about a common human defense called “projecting.” Projecting is essentially when you don’t want to face your own weakness, and so you deny your problems while seeing and disliking them in other people. Pet peeves are often projections. To be honest, I have on occasion noticed myself starting to talk extra loud in public and I hate it. That’s probably why it really bugs me so much in other people, because I’ve felt my own shallow desire to be admired and I’m not proud of that. \n\nThe truth is, most people deeply crave admiration and recognition from others. We want someone to tell us we are cool, perfect, strong, holy, or worthy. Jesus addressed this condition of the human heart in the book of Matthew, when He instructed His followers on how to fast. \n\nWhen Jesus spoke about fasting it was a common practice for Jewish people, but had become quite a show for some. This practice which is meant to humble people before the Lord, instead made them proud in their own self-righteousness. The fasting people made their deeds obvious to all around them by looking visibly disheveled and afflicted. Like the person talking loudly in the coffee shop, they wanted others to notice and affirm their value. \n\nTo the religious people fasting for human recognition, Jesus said, “You have received your reward.” Meaning, “You want human admiration so badly? Then enjoy it. But I know your heart, and you’re not doing this for me.” You see Christ told His followers to hide their fasting because He wanted to keep their intentions pure and their faces turned toward God alone, so they might find their worth and identity in Him.\n\nGod is always concerned with our heart than our sacrifices, and He shows that throughout the Sermon on the Mount. The Lord already knows the motives of our hearts and minds (Jeremiah 17:10)—the good, the bad, and the ugly. There is no sense in putting on a show, and there is no need either, because the Lord is “gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in faithful love” (Psalm 145:8-9). \n\nChrist gave us commands and practices to connect with us, not to put us under another law. As Paul proclaimed in Galatians, “For freedom, Christ set us free. Stand firm then and don’t submit again to a yoke of slavery” (Galatians 5:1). Sometimes that yoke of slavery looks like an insatiable need to have others admire you. But the Lord knows that a true sense of your value can only be found in Him, and so He wants to free you from that devastating rabbit chase.  \n\nWhatever works you are doing for the Lord, make Him your audience of one. And “your father who sees in secret will reward you.” \n\n",

I find it equal parts jarring and comforting. Jarring because so much of what I’ve spent my life building is destined to pass away. Comforting because I have assurance that the laundry that needs folding and the bills that need to be paid and the floors that need mopping won’t be going with me into eternity. (Amen!) \n\nJesus is not anti-treasure. He’s the one who buried diamonds in the caves of Africa and gold in the mountains of Colorado. He also buried a craving for treasure deep inside our hearts. He wants us to be treasure hunters. But the kind of treasure we’re hunting matters. Here, Jesus helps us see that all that shines and glitters must be lumped into one of two categories. Only two. There is no third option. \n\n“Don’t store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal” (Matthew 6:19). \n\nCategory number one is perishable treasure. Anything you’ve ever bought or built with your own two hands is perishable. Your home, your car, your 401K? Perishable, perishable, perishable. Your wardrobe, your appearance, your accolades and attagirls? Those are all perishable too. So much of our lives is destined to make a good bonfire some day. As we picture the ashes, we are tempted to wonder, What’s left?\n\nAnswer: the imperishable. \n\n“But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves don’t break in and steal” (v. 20).\n\nWhat are these heavenly treasures? God’s Word points us to three things that will last forever: the Word of God (Isaiah 40:8), the people of God (John 3:16), and the kingdom of God (Psalm 45:6). Every penny, every second we invest in these things is untouchable, locked away in a heavenly vault. It cannot rot or rust. It cannot be stolen. It can never be taken away. \n\nJesus spoke about money and possessions often, but He never branded them as evil, just perishable. As we keep listening to the Sermon on the Mount we see the real reason we need these frequent reminders. \n\n“For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also” (v. 21). \n\nYou see, it’s not the treasure Christ is concerned about; it’s our hearts. He knows that worshiping our possessions will destroy us (v. 24). Our hearts will begin to rot long before our belongings do. He warns us to “take care and be on [our] guard against all covetousness” (Luke 12:15), not because He is worried we might amass too much treasure. We can’t begin to acquire enough riches to match His. He simply knows the moment is coming when our possessions will go up in smoke. We can buy insurance for our stuff, but Jesus is offering us insurance for our hearts. \n\nGo ahead and buy the new dress you found on sale. Pick out new granite countertops. Keep folding that endless pile of laundry, but know that a day is coming when God will stack all of our belongings together for kindling and strike a match (2 Peter 3:10). As we watch our earthly treasure turn to ashes, may we celebrate our investment in the riches that can never be taken from us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:25-34, Psalm 147:7-11, Philippians 4:4-7, 1 Peter 5:6-11\n\nIt rained hard today, soaking into the summer skin of Texas, the red dirt and rolling hills. I’ve been saying for days I needed to water the Blue Salvias, even though they’re drought-resistant. They are drooping and limp. I brushed past them yesterday and saw small blue bits floating down as I did. It is easy to believe I alone am their savior, their maker. That I must breathe life into them, coddle them into adulthood, water them in the evening, and watch them at noonday when the sun is highest and hottest. But it rained hard today, and their soil is moist and wet, and their leaves shimmer with droplets clinging in earnest. They know they need the water. And they know their true Maker gives what they need.\n\nIn our home we have a saying: We must be faithful to the Word of God and not to an outcome. This is our way of encapsulating what Jesus said in Matthew 6: \n\n“So don’t worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you. Therefore don’t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own” (vv. 31-34).\n\nJesus was essentially saying that, in seeking first the kingdom, things will work out—not necessarily according to our plans, but according to His. When our attention and affection are rightly placed on God, we find that while He might not always give us what we want, He always gives us what we need. \n\nI caught myself in worry this past week, noting it because I am not normally a worrier. I plan, I think, I process, I pray, but rarely do I worry. I know nothing can be added to my life by worrying, but sometimes I think everything will be added to my life by planning, thinking, processing, and even praying. I think I am magician and maker and manipulator, and if I do it all well, I will add to my life and flourish. \n\nBut in doing so, I am deeply deceived. Nothing is added to my life by worrying or spending time fretting about how I think things ought to go. In the end, what is taken from my life is the time I spent on something other than faithfully seeking the kingdom of God. \n\nGod provides what we need, and if we don’t have it, we don’t need it. This is a hard thing to believe and an even harder thing to live out. We are prone to inventing needs: new couches and new houses, new cars, phones, bodies, and attitudes. It’s no wonder we’re also prone to worrying when those perceived needs are not met. We, like the flowers in my gardens, may droop, and we may wilt a little, we may suffer. But “after [we] have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called [us ] to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish [us]” (I Peter 5:10).\n\nToday, the God of all grace has given you all the graces you need because He cares for you. He will Himself restore you, confirm you, strengthen you, and establish you—for His sake and your good.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:1-6, Matthew 13:44-46, Romans 2:1-11, 1 Corinthians 4:1-5, James 5:7-11\n\nWe keep all the candy in a basket in the pantry. The leftover Halloween chocolates, the Easter jelly beans, gourmet candy canes from Christmas, and the Valentine hearts—they all end up in our candy basket. A whole year’s worth of sweets for five children. It’s quite a haul. Some years we just forget about it until it degrades, and I throw it away. Once we pulled it all out and decorated our most extravagantly baroque gingerbread house ever. This year, since the kids are a little older, I’ve been pulling out treats and doling them out for occasional sugar-joy.\n\nSince I don’t trust them to make responsible sugar choices, the kids aren’t allowed to get into the candy themselves. But I am. And I do. Not all of it tempts me. I could go the rest of my life without sour or hard candies. But there are some very grown-up chocolates and cookies that sing a sticky-gooey siren song. It floats out from under the door of the pantry, calling to me. I sneak in and steal a snack. Now, if one of my tender babes stole a treat, I would come down hard on them. I’d start by taking away the candy, then lecturing on the dangers of stealing, followed by the risks of sugar on teeth, and then I’d dole out the consequences.\n\nI’ve got a log in my eye. I think my kids have the problem, but really it’s me. I expect my kids to adhere to a standard that I definitely do not hold myself to. I find myself extending that double standard of judgment readily and easily to other people as well.\n\nHave you ever found yourself saying to your friends, “I can’t even imagine doing what she did”? And while it’s possible that you may never be tempted by that specific sin, you are tempted by your besetting sins. We all have those secret sins that we don’t want anyone to know about. And we all have our personal favorite everyday-variety sins that we brush away. Perhaps we’ve just brushed them away so many times that we cease to even think of them as sins. \n\nIt’s so much easier to focus on the speck in your brother’s eye, or the flaw in your sister’s character. But I’m just looking past the timber lodged in my own eye when I start looking around for everyone else’s sawdust.\n\nHonestly, we love to judge others differently than we judge ourselves. I have reasons, excuses, justifications for my own faults. And that’s it: when we’re talking about me, they are “faults” or “weaknesses”—definitely not sins. Or so I tell myself. But God has shown us more grace than we could ever show anyone else. Knowing this, how can I judge? \n\nThe poet G.M. Hopkins writes:\n\n“Mend first [the] vital candle in close heart’s vault:\n\nYou there are master, do your own desire;\n\nWhat hinders? Are you beam-blind, yet to a fault\n\nin a neighbor deft-handed? Are you that liar[?]”\n\nAre you beam-blind? Do you ignore the guttering of your own candle while criticizing someone else’s flame? Do you, while camped out in utter darkness, judge the dim light of others? Do you admonish others for candy-grabbing, while you actually do the same yourself, in secret?\n\nMay God grant us ears to hear and hearts to receive this rebuke to our hypocrisy. May we not trample such precious pearls of admonition, ignoring our logs. And thanks be to God, that He does not deal with us as our iniquities deserve, but has poured out mercy on us! (Psalm 103:10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:7-12, Proverbs 8:12-21, James 1:5-6, Revelation 3:19-20\n\nMy kids are constantly reminding me of how I behave with my heavenly Father—that is, like a child. It’s so incredibly humbling. \n\nOne such incident occurred a few years back, when we took our kids out for dinner on a Friday night. We were too stuffed for dessert, but when you go to the Cheesecake Factory and don’t order cheesecake, I’m pretty sure a puppy dies or an angel loses its wings. So we ordered a couple of slices to-go, my husband and I secretly planning to make a fun memory with the kids later that night.\n\nIt was already an hour past the kids’ bedtime when we headed home. Even so, as we drove, my oldest, who was seven at the time, grew concerned that his fun evening out with the family was coming to an abrupt end. He fretted and squirmed the whole ride home, even when we told him we had a surprise planned and encouraged him to trust us. But he just couldn’t. He made himself miserable worrying about the cheesecake and bedtime and other things seven-year-olds worry about.\n\nEven if you’re an adult, my guess is you can identify with this, at least a little.  \n\nThe plan was way better than he could have asked or imagined. Bedtime would have been a perfectly practical choice, but Ryan and I had planned to park in our little downtown, find a pretty place to sit, and enjoy a ridiculously late-night cheesecake feast with the kids, by the light of the moon.\n\nIt was a pretty great plan. It was the plan all along. \n\nAny amount of fretting and whining our kids did on the ride home, when they were certain they were going straight to bed, didn’t change what we had planned for them. We wanted to give them a sweet experience—not because of their good behavior, but because they are our children, we delight in them, and we wanted to give them a good gift.\n\n“If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him” (Matthew 7:11).\n\nWe have some pretty big ideas of how our lives should go. We feel strongly about what we don’t want to happen, and we’re perfectly willing to spend our entire lives fretting and fussing, not trusting that God is for us. \n\nOur Father wants to give us bread and fish and moonlit cheesecake picnics. He also wants to give us appropriate bedtimes and vegetables. Jesus knew His disciples were going to need righteousness, purity, unity, wisdom, humility, and more to carry out the work that was coming. And so He’s essentially saying to them, and us, “Just ask! It’s all yours!”\n\nHe has a pretty great plan. It’s been His plan all along.\n\nDo you lack wisdom? Is there something else you need in order to carry out the Father’s work? Do you trust that He will equip you with every supply? \n\nThe Father gives to His children generously and ungrudgingly (James 1:5). So go ahead: Ask. Seek. Knock. “For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened” (Matthew 7:8).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:13-23, Psalm 16:7-11, Matthew 22:1-14, John 10:11-15, John 14:1-6, Romans 2:12-13\n\nI was once the proud owner of my very own pair of scratch ‘n sniff pants. Every time I bring this up, I receive looks as if I’ve been the victim of an unfortunate crime and then asked, “What was the scent? Sweat? Soap? Linen?” (Incidentally, I do think this was a missed opportunity in the ‘90s for laundry detergent companies.) But no, they were purple and smelled like grapes, of course.\n\nAs you can imagine, I was sitting high and walking tall in those bad boys. My friends marveled at the way they really did smell like grapes, and I loved letting people in on the secret. Purple pants were one thing, but grape-scented purple pants gave me a real edge in the fashion world. But it only lasted for so long. It turns out that the fruity fragrance was only guaranteed to last for the first ten washes. And since I wanted to maximize the appearance of my newfound style sense, those ten washes came and went pretty fast.\n\nSo there I was, boasting about the scratch ‘n sniff goodness, only for it to be gone. The worst part? No one believed I ever owned scratch ‘n sniff pants in the first place, and there’s little point to owning purple pants if they don’t smell like grapes. Just smelling like a fruit wasn’t enough; it wasn’t long-lasting, and it definitely wasn’t genuine.\n\nMatthew 7 talks about two kinds of fruits: good and bad. It says once we see a piece of fruit, we’ll know exactly which tree it came from. “A good tree can’t produce bad fruit; neither can a bad tree produce good fruit” (v.18).\n\nBut what if it smells good but looks bad? What if the person putting the sticker on the fruit uses the wrong one? Or, questions we more commonly ask:\n\nWhat if I sometimes sin and sometimes do the right thing?\n\nWhat if I repent after I do something wrong?\n\nWhat if I look like I have it all together from the outside, but I’m a mess on the inside?\n\nAll of these questions are rooted in fear:\n\nWhat will God do with me then?\n\nWill I still get into heaven?\n\nAm I enough?\n\nFriends, I love a good gray area as much as a pair of purple pants, but nothing about a gray area is eternal. There’s nothing—and no one—standing in “the undecided middle” that will not one day be sorted into good or bad. It will not be enough to just smell or taste like good fruit; we must be fruit grown from the love of God.\n\nBut let’s not be so foolish as to take this passage from the Sermon on the Mount, this lack of middle ground, as a scare tactic. May we always remember that the work has already been done. God separated the world into darkness and light, and Jesus grabbed us by the hand and took us to His side. It is the truest grace that we do not have to live in a gray area. Thanks be to God; we have already entered into the kingdom if we are in Christ Jesus.\n\nMay we smell like His fruit, and serve like His hands, just as we are remembered by His love. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:24-29, Psalm 18:1-6, Isaiah 17:10-11, Matthew 25:1-13, 2 Corinthians 3:18, James 2:20-23\n\nSomewhere in Nashville there’s a toddler-sized red and white cowgirl outfit from the 60s, complete with embroidered yellow flowers and white leather fringe. It was given to my daughter by our elderly neighbors, brought out of a wooden chest and handed to my wide-eyed girl when she was about 3 years old. Now, several years later, it circulates among my friends and their own little wide-eyed girls. \n\nCarlton and Joyce were good neighbors, always watching over our small yard from the front porch of their brick cottage across the street. I winced from my own front porch the day the wrecking ball swung with intention and knocked down that empty house. My toddler boys watched in delight and awe as the big, loud machines did their work, but my heart ached. \n\nMy friends lived three decades of life in that house. They raised their girls there, watching their city grow tall around them. They collected snowman figurines and looked out for their neighbors. Then, when most of their life had been lived, they moved on and let the wrecking ball do its worst. \n\nThe thing that strikes me about this short passage in Matthew is not the dichotomy of outcome, but the similarity of process. One house collapses with a crash and one stands strong—the contrast is stark. But the circumstances the two houses endure are remarkably similar. In fact, they are just the same: “The rain fell, the rivers rose, the winds blew and pounded that house” (Matthew 7:25, 27). Similar process, very different outcome. \n\nAll of our earthly houses will one day fall. We’re all honest enough to admit it. We know the things of earth don’t last and we’d do well to store up eternal possessions instead. But how do we do that? How do we build a metaphorical house that literally lasts forever? \n\n“Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock” (Matthew 7:24). \n\nHear Jesus’ words. Act on Jesus’ words. This is how we practically and actually build our house on the rock. \n\nDid your brain just register that last little paragraph as, “Be a good Christian”? If so, you’re not alone. I hear that, too. So let’s slow down and consider it again. \n\nHear Jesus’ words. Act on Jesus’ words. Here are just a handful of them: \n\n“Repent and believe the good news!” (Mark 1:15).\n\n“Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28).\n\n“Love one another. Just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another” (John 13:34).\n\n“Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you” (Matthew 7:7).\n\n“The one who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, will have streams of living water flow from deep within him” (John 7:38).\n\nThe words of Christ are life-giving; they are trustworthy and true. We can stake our lives on them. We can build our houses on them. \n\nHis words do not merely impart rules for smart living—tips for a favorable outcome. Jesus’ words impart life and love and salvation. The life Christ gives cannot be washed away by heavy rains, or consumed by the rising tide, or displaced by gale-force winds. His Word is eternal. It cannot become untrue. \n\nSo then, go ahead and build your life. Build houses and meet neighbors and raise wide-eyed girls and boys. Let’s live well this one life we’ve been given, but let’s do so on the only foundation that will last: the gospel of Jesus Christ. For when all our years and efforts and cottages crumble around us, His Word will stand. We are forever secure when our home is found in Him.\n\n \n\n",

Her family was so poor that when baby Fanny got a simple eye infection at six weeks old, they were unable to help her, resulting in the loss of her vision before she was even weaned. Still, she grew to be one of the most prolific hymn writers in America. Over the course of her 94 years, Fanny Crosby wrote well over 8,000 gospel songs. Given that she used more than 200 pen names, there may well be many more.\n\nFanny often composed lyrics to music written by friends. She just had a knack for it. But Fanny had standards, and wouldn’t write lyrics to just any old tune. Sometimes musicians would bring music from a saloon song and propose that she sanctify the lyrics. At this proposition, Fanny crossed her dignified ankles and declared, “Oh my, no.” She maintained that the Church must never sing its songs to the melodies of the world.\n\nOne of her dearest musician friends was Phoebe Knapp. And as poor as Fanny was, Phoebe was rich. She was born into the Brooklyn elite, and enjoyed the advantages of great wealth. These two very different women attended the same church and struck up a dear friendship. You could say Fanny’s favorite frolic was the philharmonics at Phoebe’s fancy flat.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Russ Ramsey\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 51:1-9, John 1:10-18, Ephesians 1:7-12, Colossians 1:9-14, 1 Peter 1:17-21\n\nThis simple hymn is a Trojan horse filled with doctrine. It lays out the effects of believing in the sacrifice of Jesus, hiding those truths in the hearts of those who sing them. And a great many have. This hymn by Lewis Edgar Jones has appeared in hundreds of hymnals down through the years and is still widely known and sung today.\n\nLewis Jones graduated from the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, then went to work for the Young Men’s Christian Association, better known as the YMCA. Jones wore many hats in his role with the YMCA, including organizing camps for those young men. Hymn writing was something he considered more of a side project. Often writing under pseudonyms, Jones wrote not to gain fame but to serve his campers.\n\nIt was during a camp meeting in Mountain Lake Park, Maryland, that Jones wrote both the lyrics and melody for “There Is Power in the Blood.” The simple song served a simple purpose: to remind the singer that he is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ alone—not by anything he himself does. 5\n\nSince that camp meeting, countless believers, young and old, have sung the song around campfires everywhere, proclaiming the ways the blood of Christ rescues sinners: \n\nIt frees us from the burden of sin and secures our victory over it. \n\nIt works against our pride even as it cleanses us of guilt. \n\nIt purifies us and calls us to praise Jesus for His generous grace.\n\nUsing repetition, rhyme, and imagery, Jones’s song clarifies what it means to trust in Christ. Listen as the refrain unpacks the glorious truth: There’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nThere Is Power in the Blood\n\nby Lewis Edgar Jones\n\nWould you be free from the burden of sin?\n\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\n\nWould you o’er evil a victory win?\n\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nRefrain:\n\nThere is power, power, wonder-working power\n\nIn the blood of the Lamb.\n\nThere is power, power, wonder-working power\n\nIn the precious blood of the Lamb.\n\nWould you be free from your passion and pride?\n\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\n\nCome for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide;\n\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nWould you be whiter, much whiter than snow?\n\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\n\nSin stains are lost in its life-giving flow;\n\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nWould you do service for Jesus your King?\n\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\n\nWould you live daily His praises to sing?\n\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\n",

He stayed on there as a professor, eventually becoming chair of his department and then president of a nearby university. Once the man put himself on a path, he didn’t budge.\n\nTeaching paid the bills, but John’s joyful pursuit was discovering and preserving African American spiritual music. He led the Fisk Jubilee Singers for six years, touring at home and abroad. The Nashville boy got to see the world and share the art of the African American spiritual along the way. In a time when few black men were afforded the luxury of travel, John Jr. performed for Queen Victoria.\n\nIt took three generations of Works men over 70 years of field research, transcription, and publishing to put together a wide collection of African American spirituals which otherwise could have been lost to history. It was in this collection that John Jr. became the first to publish the hymn “Go Tell It on the Mountain.” \n\nThis hymn, like other spirituals of the era, had previously been communicated through singing only. Putting the tune and lyrics down on paper was a way John could give voice to the unknown slave who had composed the song many years before—who, despite his earthly enslavement, sang out with victorious hope. \n\n“Go Tell It on the Mountain” celebrates the good news of the God who makes Himself known to His people, right where they are.\n\nGo Tell It on the Mountain\n\nAdapted by John W.

One of the many was the hymn-writing career of Johnson Oatman, Jr. \n\nHe wrote 5,000 hymns during his lifetime, a handful widely regarded as standards: “Higher Ground,” “No, Not One!,” and “Count Your Many Blessings.” That final example was first published in a songbook for young people. It is considered to be Oatman’s opus. One critic said: “Like a beam of sunlight it has brightened up the dark places of the earth.”\n\nThe Sunday nights of my childhood were spent in church, hemmed in among the waistlines of good Baptists. The feeling was laid back, no strict order of service like the morning. Often the song leader would loosen his tie and ask us for our favorite hymns. We Baptists didn’t bet, but some voice crying out “Count Your Many Blessings” was a sure thing, every time.\n\nOn those easy-like-Sunday evenings, the last half of that hymn’s chorus held a temptation too great for a song leader to resist: congregational participation. He’d always surrender. He would gradually slow us during that high E-flat “Count your blessings,” followed by the descending “name them one by one.” Then he’d bring us up full stop, still as sheep. He’d grin and say, “Now I know one of you has a blessing to count.” A grateful voice would rise, followed by another, and then another. And we would name them, always surprised at what the Lord had done, every time.\n\nCount Your Blessings\n\nby Johnson Oatman, Jr.\n\nWhen upon life’s billows you are tempest tossed,\n\nWhen you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,\n\nCount your many blessings, name them one by one,\n\nAnd it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.\n\nRefrain:\n\nCount your blessings, name them one by one;\n\nCount your blessings, see what God hath done;\n\nCount your blessings, name them one by one;\n\nCount your many blessings, see what God hath done.\n\nAre you ever burdened with a load of care?\n\nDoes the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?\n\nCount your many blessings, ev’ry doubt will fly,\n\nAnd you will be singing as the days go by.\n\nWhen you look at others with their lands and gold,\n\nThink that Christ has promised you His wealth untold;\n\nCount your many blessings, money cannot buy\n\nYour reward in heaven, nor your home on high.\n\nSo, amid the conflict, whether great or small,\n\nDo not be discouraged, God is over all;\n\nCount your many blessings, angels will attend,\n\nHelp and comfort give you to your journey’s end.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Isaiah 1:18, Mark 10:45, 2 Corinthians 12:1-10, Ephesians 1:13-14, 1 Peter 1:18-21, Revelation 5:11-14\n\nWhenever I imagine the writing of a hymn, I picture a Victorian-era man with mutton chops and mussed up hair, scribbling by the flickering light of a lantern. His fingers are smudged with ink as he prays and pens and receives inspiration. A piano sits nearby, where he taps out a tune to adorn his words. It’s a very holy, solitary affair.\n\nPerhaps other hymns were written this way, but “Jesus Paid It All” was not. Of the hymn’s origin, one author put it this way: “An obscure woman scribbles a poem on the flyleaf of her hymnal, an amateur church musician unknowingly creates a matching tune, an unknown pastor provides encouragement, and another hymn is born.”\n\nWritten in 1865, this hymn about the total sufficiency of Christ’s atoning work on the cross was not a solitary affair, but a fruit of His church. Partially inspired by William Bradbury’s hymn by the same name, this version was written by Elvina M. Hall, while she sat listening to a sermon from the choir loft of Monument Street Methodist Church in Baltimore, Maryland. She jotted the lyrics on the inside of her hymnal and shared them with her pastor after the service.\n\nNothing might have become of those lyrics had John T. Grape not also attended Hall’s church. \n\nThirty years earlier, Grape served as organist and choir director, during which time he composed a tune titled “All to Christ I Owe.” After hearing the music, the pastor was reportedly “unimpressed,” and set it aside. Thankfully, that same pastor recalled Grape’s tune as he read Hall’s words some three decades later. He believed they would make a great match, and history has proven him right.\n\nThe story of “Jesus Paid It All” is a marvelous exhibit of God assembling various talents over time to orchestrate something beautiful and powerful: a song of our complete redemption.\n\nJesus Paid It All\n\nby Elvina M. Hall\n\nI hear the Savior say,\n\n“Thy strength indeed is small,\n\nChild of weakness, watch and pray,\n\nFind in Me thine all in all.”\n\nRefrain:\n\nJesus paid it all,\n\nAll to Him I owe;\n\n Sin had left a crimson stain,\n\n He washed it white as snow.\n\nLord, now indeed I find\n\nThy pow’r and Thine alone,\n\nCan change the leper’s spots\n\nAnd melt the heart of stone.\n\nFor nothing good have I\n\nWhereby Thy grace to claim;\n\nI’ll wash my garments white\n\nIn the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.\n\nAnd when, before the throne,\n\nI stand in Him complete,\n\n“Jesus died my soul to save,”\n\nMy lips shall still repeat.\n\n",

One such teen was Bessie, a 14-year-old daughter of an alcoholic. Black met her in an alley in town, invited her to church, and she accepted. Bessie attended regularly until one day, as Black called roll, she did not respond.\n\nThe gospel teacher’s heart was moved by her absence. He said to the class, “When my own name is called up yonder, may I be there to respond.”\n\nAfter Sunday school, James Black went to Bessie’s home to find her laid up with pneumonia, on the verge of death. Again his heart was pierced. He went home and, in a single sitting, wrote “When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder.” A few days later he led the congregation in singing the hymn at Bessie’s funeral.\n\nMore than a century later, Black’s song remains a reminder of hope in the face of mortality and suffering—a proclamation of the certainty of Christ’s coming. It isn’t a declaration of judgment, or some hellfire and brimstone dirge. The lyrics lift the soul and call listeners to Jesus.\n\nBlack calls believers to revel in, reflect publicly, and proclaim the love of Jesus—“of all His wondrous love and care”—as he did for Bessie and so many like her. His hymn points to the promise of eternal hope and joy for those in Jesus when God calls them home.\n\nWhen the Roll Is Called Up Yonder\n\nby James Black\n\nWhen the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more,\n\nand the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;\n\nwhen the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore,\n\nand the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.\n\nRefrain:\n\nWhen the roll is called up yonder,\n\nwhen the roll is called up yonder,\n\nwhen the roll is called up yonder,\n\nwhen the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.\n\nOn that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise,\n\nand the glory of His resurrection share;\n\nwhen His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies,\n\nand the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.\n\nLet us labor for the Master from the dawn till setting sun;\n\nlet us talk of all His wondrous love and care;\n\nthen when all of life is over, and our work on earth is done,\n\nand the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.\n\n",

Austin Miles was a pharmacist by trade, but the darkroom was home to his truer loves: photography and Bible-reading. He’d sit and read Scripture while waiting for film to develop, his well-worn Bible illuminated by the room’s familiar glow. \n\nOn such a day in March 1912, Miles began to process his photos, then opened his Bible to John chapter 20 as he waited. He’d read the passage before; it was one of his favorites. But this time, the scene seemed to come alive. He found himself imagining he was face to face with Jesus as He spoke to Mary near the empty garden tomb.\n\nOf the experience Miles wrote, “I awakened in full light, gripping the Bible, with muscles tense and nerves vibrating. Under the inspiration of this vision, I wrote as quickly as the words could be formed the poem exactly as it appeared. That same evening I wrote the music.”\n\nIn addition to his photos, Miles had developed a reputation as a music director at conventions, churches, camp meetings, and the like. Not long before that March inspiration, a music publisher named Adam Geibel had asked Miles to compose a specific type of hymn—one that was sympathetic and tender, “one that would bring hope to the hopeless, rest for the weary, and downy pillows to dying beds.”14 With the Holy Spirit’s help, a “downy pillow” for the soul is just what he delivered. \n\nWe all come to the garden alone, but our suffering Savior meets us there. He tells us what is true: we are His own.\n\nIn the Garden\n\nby C. Austin Miles\n\nI come to the garden alone,\n\nWhile the dew is still on the roses;\n\nAnd the voice I hear, falling on my ear,\n\nThe Son of God discloses.\n\nRefrain:\n\nAnd He walks with me, and He talks with me,\n\nAnd He tells me I am His own,\n\nAnd the joy we share as we tarry there,\n\nNone other has ever known.\n\nHe speaks, and the sound of His voice\n\nIs so sweet the birds hush their singing;\n\nAnd the melody that He gave to me\n\nWithin my heart is ringing.\n\nI’d stay in the garden with Him\n\nTho’ the night around me be falling;\n\nBut He bids me go; thro’ the voice of woe,\n\nHis voice to me is calling.\n\nSources:\n\nMorgan, Robert J.

One of the more popular of these traveling teachers was A.J. Showalter. Showalter published over 130 music books, his sales exceeding more than two million copies. He traveled throughout the South to various churches, spending roughly a month with each of them, teaching these revival songs. \n\nOn one of these trips, while in the small town of Hartselle, Alabama, A.J. Showalter returned to his room to find two pieces of mail. Each was from a former student, and each contained a tragic story. Both students had lost their wives on the same day and were now widowers. \n\nEager to offer them solace, Showalter searched the scriptures till he found Deuteronomy 33:27, which read, “The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.” And so he began to write the memorable chorus,\n\nLeaning, leaning, safe and secure from all alarm\n\nLeaning, leaning, leaning on the everlasting arms.\n\nShowalter sent the devastated men these words of comfort even as he was still struggling to compose the verses. He shared what he’d written with a friend, Elisha Hoffman, who then provided the verses. With those verses in place, Showalter wrote the music of the hymn we know today.\n\nIt’s ironic that this hymn, born of great tragedy, is couched in an upbeat tune that makes it so easy to remember. But in times of great sorrow, there can be no better truth to recall than this: we can lean, safe and secure, on the everlasting arms of our Lord.\n\nLeaning on the Everlasting Arms\n\nby E. A. Hoffman\n\nWhat a fellowship, what a joy divine,\n\nleaning on the everlasting arms;\n\nwhat a blessedness, what a peace is mine,\n\nleaning on the everlasting arms.\n\nRefrain:\n\nLeaning, leaning,\n\nsafe and secure from all alarms;\n\nleaning, leaning,\n\nleaning on the everlasting arms.\n\nO how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,\n\nleaning on the everlasting arms;\n\nO how bright the path grows from day to day,\n\nleaning on the everlasting arms.\n\nWhat have I to dread, what have I to fear,\n\nleaning on the everlasting arms?\n\nI have blessed peace with my Lord so near,\n\nleaning on the everlasting arms.\n\n",

To make matters worse, he was also kind, an expert swimmer, captain of the baseball team, and student orchestra leader. Babcock’s tall, muscled figure was the only thing about him that wasn’t well-rounded. \n\nAfter graduating from Syracuse University, he attended Auburn Theological Seminary and eventually became the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Lockport, New York. In between his daily pastoral duties, Babcock itched to get out of the church office and explore the outdoors surrounding it. \n\nHis favorite place to walk was a large hill two miles away that overlooked Lake Ontario. Grabbing his coat and running out the door, Babcock would tell his secretary, “I’m going to see my Father’s world.” He’d later write a sixteen-stanza poem, each verse beginning with that very same sentiment: “This is my Father’s world.”\n\nSadly, Maltbie Babcock died at age 42 from a bacteria he contracted on a ship en route to the Holy Land. Following his death, his wife compiled his writings into a book called Thoughts for Everyday Living, published in 1901. Fourteen years later, in 1915, the tune for this poem-turned-hymn was arranged from an old English melody by one of Babcock’s close friends, accomplished musician F.L. Sheppard.\n\nStill a favorite today, “This Is My Father’s World” reminds us not only of the beauty of creation, but of the way it tethers us to the more enduring beauty of the gospel and to the goodness of our Father.\n\nThis Is My Father’s World\n\nby Maltbie D.

He eventually pursued his artistic dreams at the collegiate level, and after graduation moved to Pennsylvania, where he immediately took up a position as an art teacher. \n\nAs a young adult he was able to venture out on a tour of some of Europe’s finest galleries, taking in great masterpieces and refining his own painterly skills. Some said he had the makings of a truly exceptional artist, poised to take his place among the greats.\n\nJudson had been a devout believer since his youth, and as an adult, he became active in the music ministry at his church. Though he’d always loved being an artist, the tug of ministry life proved a real struggle for him. God had all along been wooing him to full-time ministry, and it seemed that his hope of a life of artistic influence would have to go. After years of struggle, Judson knelt in prayer, saying, “I surrender all to Thee.”19 Years later, he penned the hymn inspired by this pivotal moment of calling. \n\nFrom this patient life of submission, God brought forth much fruit—not only through the impact of this famous American hymn, but also through Judson’s ongoing service at Florida Bible Institute, where a young Billy Graham was inspired by Judson’s ministry. \n\nAs in Judson’s life, the gentle moving of God’s Spirit often works by ordinary means to affect in us extraordinary surrender. May our hearts, quickened by His Spirit, be conformed to His likeness, molded by His love, and enlivened by His power, that we may rest on nothing of our own, but surrender all to Him.\n\nI Surrender All\n\nby Judson W. Van DeVenter\n\nAll to Jesus I surrender,\n\nAll to Him I freely give;\n\nI will ever love and trust Him,\n\nIn His presence daily live.\n\nRefrain:\n\nI surrender all, I surrender all;\n\nAll to Thee, my blessed Savior,\n\nI surrender all.\n\nAll to Jesus I surrender,\n\nMake my, Savior, wholly Thine;\n\nLet me feel Thy Holy Spirit,\n\nTruly know that Thou art mine.\n\nAll to Jesus I surrender,\n\nLord, I give myself to Thee;\n\nFill me with Thy love and power,\n\nLet Thy blessing fall on me.\n\n",

This song was sung with an eye toward the goal: worship on God’s holy hill. It is the song of a person who is stirred to leave a broken world in search of a place where peace reigns.\n\nDissatisfaction with the brokenness of our world is an essential component to a pilgrim’s journey. It stirs us to get up from where we are and seek a better way. We aren’t called simply to flee from the lies of our culture. We are called to flee to God.\n\nReflect\n\n1. Do you know any other leaving songs? What are they about? What do you want to be delivered from? What do you want to leave? Why?\n\n2. The pilgrim-disciple prays to be delivered from lies. What are the lies that most often have your ear? Do you struggle to recognize the lies you are told? What lies do you tell to paint yourself in a better light? Why do you think we do this?\n\n3. What does it mean to flee to God? In what ways do you practice, or in what ways can you begin to practice, fleeing to God?\n\n\n\n",

Our goal in life is to grow in our understanding of who God is and who we are in our relationship with Him.\n\nReflect\n\n1. This psalm promotes enthusiastic obedience to God’s commands.

Of Solomon.\n\n 1 Unless the LORD builds a house,\n\nits builders labor over it in vain;\n\nunless the LORD watches over a city,\n\nthe watchman stays alert in vain.\n\n2 In vain you get up early and stay up late,\n\nworking hard to have enough food—\n\nyes, he gives sleep to the one he loves.\n\n3 Sons are indeed a heritage from the LORD,|\n\noffspring, a reward.\n\n4 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior\n\nare the sons born in one’s youth.\n\n5 Happy is the man who has filled his quiver with them.\n\nThey will never be put to shame\n\nwhen they speak with their enemies at the city gate.\n\n//\n\nA Song About the Builder and Protector\n\nThe pilgrim-disciple sings of how God is both the builder and protector of everything sacred—from our work to our families.\n\nEveryone is trying to build something and protect something. Ultimately, behind many of our attempts to build and protect lies a deep-seated need to be in control. When the need to control grips you, take that to the Lord. Unless He frees you, you will not be free.\n\nReflect\n\n1. What are you trying to build or protect? Why? How do you go about it? What does this reveal about how you see God and how you see yourself?\n\n2. What do you do when fear confronts you? What would the people closest to you say you do when you feel the need to gain control? How effective are your methods?\n\n3. Read Philippians 4:6 and Proverbs 3:5-8. What should we do when worry or fear comes over us? How do you respond to Psalm 127:2?\n\n \n\n",

We are not passive in this process. This song calls us to work diligently, to love self-sacrificially, and to train the children in our lives to know and walk with God. We don’t just think about God; we live in response to His Word to us. Obedience is a path to joy.\n\nReflect\n\n1. This happy song celebrates prosperity. What sort of prosperity helps us know and love God better? What sort of prosperity makes it hard to know and love God? What sort of prosperity does this psalm value, and how do we obtain the “blessedness” described here?\n\n2. Why is obedience to God’s commands a path to joy? Do you believe it is? Where do you struggle to accept this idea? Why?\n\n3. On what basis do we have hope for receiving God’s eternal blessings? What are those blessings?\n\n \n\n",

We should want evil eradicated from the world and we should ask God to do it—not simply because we loathe how bad it can be, but because there is something even higher we want: peace. Jesus broke the curse by taking our sin upon Himself, giving us that peace.\n\nReflect\n\n1. What questions come to mind when you read verses in the Bible calling for God to put the wicked to shame? Why do you think God gave us a psalm like this?\n\n2. Are you offended by the evil around you? What is the war-song in your heart? What do you want the Lord to banish from this world? Why?\n\n3. How do we apply a psalm like this to our own hearts? Where do you see the seeds of wickedness bearing unwanted fruit in your own life? How does God tell us He has dealt with the evil in us?\n\n\n\n",

If God were to hold our sin against us, we could not enter into His presence. But God’s mercy beckons us to come to Him. The God who forgives is to be revered and trusted. We depend on God, and in Christ He gives us everything we need to know Him and worship Him without fear.\n\nReflect\n\n1. The opening verse of this psalm has an urgency to it. The pilgrim-disciple is asking the Lord to hear her cries for mercy. What is typically your most urgent prayer? Why?\n\n2. Do you believe your sin makes it so that, apart from God’s mercy, you could not stand before Him? Do you believe He shows mercy and forgives? Why or why not?\n\n3. This is a corporate song—one believers would sing together. What impact would it have on a community if every member believed they needed God’s mercy, and trusted that God gives it? In what ways do you add strength to your community by believing in the mercy and forgiveness we have in Christ?\n\n",

When we grasp this, we begin to trust that growing comfortable with our sense of place is part of God’s good gift to us.

But rather than return to a remembered past, she looks forward to a better future glory.\n\nIn the first half of this song (vv.1-10), God’s people cry out for God to repeat something He did before, about which they hold idealized memories. In the second half (vv.11-18), God beckons them to lift their eyes from the romantic fog of nostalgia and stop wishing for the past. Our security does not lie in a bygone era, but in an ongoing relationship with an eternal God.\n\nReflect\n\n1. Are there any seasons in your past you wish you could return to? Why?\n\n2. In his essay “The Weight of Glory,” C. S. Lewis describes nostalgia as “only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.” When we long to go back to a remembered time, or when we look forward to better days, what are we ultimately longing for?\n\n3.

This second kind requires vulnerability and intimacy, trust and the laying down of self. Finding unity with others takes work as well as risk. It is something we celebrate because it is both rare and good.\n\nReflect\n\n1. Is there someone from your past or present with whom you need to pursue reconciliation—someone you need to move toward in love? In what ways do you “behold how unpleasant it is” to dwell in disunity?\n\n2. What are some of the best ways you can actively pursue Christian community? Why is it important to cultivate spiritual friendships?\n\n3. This psalm describes our unity with one another as something that carries over into eternity. How does regarding our spiritual friendships as eternal relationships help us love each other? Forgive each other? Respect each other?\n\n",

    "devo_title": "What Is a Miracle?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Kings 18:20-40; Psalm 65:5-8; Exodus 12:40-42,51; Exodus 14:21-31; Exodus 19:16-25; Exodus 7:3-5\n\nSeeing is not believing. \n\nI ask for miracles all the time. I implore God for snow days, chase after lost causes, and jockey for acclaim. I ask God to change people. I ask Him to change me. And most of all, I ask Him to heal.\n\nThe possibility of miracles is such lush fruit to my imagination. It means that anything is possible. God could pop down, give a little nudge, and fix any problem. And when He doesn’t, it’s confusing. If He could do a miracle, why doesn’t He do one for me?\n\nIn preparing for this study, I noticed that Jesus doesn’t do miracles on command. He isn’t anybody’s trick pony. In fact, He blesses those “who do not see, and yet believe” (John 20:29), and He rebukes a generation that “seeks for a sign” (Matthew 12:39). And, man, I do love a good sign. \n\nIt seems if Jesus were just willing to do a bit of skywriting, all would believe and the world would be saved. It’s so much easier to ask for a sign instead of looking to the person of Christ, to hunt after what He can do for us instead of who He is. His miracles aren’t His message, but rather a testament to who He is. And even those who witnessed His miracles did not necessarily believe.\n\nThis study focuses on miracles performed by Jesus. But for a big picture, let’s step back and look at all kinds of miracles in the Bible. When reading any scripture, I ask myself, “What is God doing in this passage?” These passages on miracles make it easy to answer that question and learn more about the character of God in the process. \n\nHe is supreme and omnipresent: God shows His unearthly power when He scorches the dripping-wet sacrifices for Elijah at Mt. Carmel (1 Kings 18). \n\nHe is sovereign and omnipotent: He is the Master of nature and quiets the storms (Matthew 8:23-27). \n\nHe is merciful and good: He is the source of our salvation (John 3:16; Hebrews 5:7-10). \n\nHe is holy and omniscient: He is the thundering presence on Mount Sinai (Exodus 19). \n\nMiracles are one of the ways God expresses His “otherness” to us. They reveal Him in His power, and show us He is not like us. The rules of nature that bind us do not bind Him. The laws of a created world are amendable by the One who created it.\n\nAs we read through this study, think about what Jesus’ miracles tell us about His character. Remember that these are nothing less than acts of God performed by Immanuel, “God with us.” Although signs and wonders may not accompany every moment of our lives, the One who makes them possible does.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Why Did Jesus Perform Miracles?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 11:2-5, Isaiah 61:1-3, John 2:11, Matthew 12:28-42\n\nMost of us have been there. It’s not just painful, but confusingly painful. \n\nDidn’t God hear?\n\nDoesn’t He love me?\n\nDid I not have enough faith?\n\nWhy wasn’t it a yes?\n\nThese are the questions we ask when the miracle doesn’t come.\n\nPerhaps it was the cancer that wasn’t cured, the chronic illness that never healed, the marriage that couldn’t be saved, or the money that didn’t come through. In the absence of a miracle, these stories about Jesus can be tough to swallow. They can even feel cruel. Why are they here, if not to tease us?\n\nGod knows we feel this tension, which is perhaps why He included Matthew 11:2-5 in His perfect Word. Here, John the Baptist asks Jesus if He is, in fact, the “one who is to come”—the Messiah. Jesus answers with a clear allusion to Isaiah 61: “Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up” (Matthew 11:4-5). He’s essentially saying, “Yes. All the things that were foretold, I am fulfilling them.”\n\nJesus’ answer to John tells us a lot about the purpose of His miracles: They are a sign of the prophecies fulfilled, a sign that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah. They are a sign of His authority, His power, and His glory. And they are a sign of God’s love for us, a sign that we can trust Him. \n\nBut here’s what we shouldn’t miss about Jesus’ answer, because John certainly wouldn’t have. Isaiah 61 also says this of the coming Messiah: He will “proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound” (v.1). It’s a message of hope for prisoners, which is exactly what John was; John received Jesus’ message while sitting in a prison cell. And yet, John the Baptist was never set free. Three chapters later, he’s beheaded. Scripture tells us that when Jesus got word of John the Baptist’s death, “he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself” (Matthew 14:13). \n\nOur God is not indifferent to our pain.\n\nMatthew 11:2-5 contains all the power and the glory and the complexity and confusion of Jesus’ miracles. It attests to Jesus’ divine identity, but it also attests to the reality that miracles don’t always come. In this tension, we learn more about what Jesus’ miracles mean.\n\nJesus’ miracles weren’t only about Him, but about the Kingdom to come. Tucked into every miracle we can almost hear God whisper, “This is what the Kingdom is like. It’s complete healing, total wholeness, freedom, awe, and joy.” Miracles provide a foretaste of this in-breaking Kingdom, but they were never meant to replace it. \n\nWe’ll never have the perfect peace and restoration we desire this side of eternity, but miracles point to the place where we will.\n\nWhenever we read stories of miracles, and grapple with their surpassing mystery, we can do so knowing our God is not casual or removed from our pain. Jesus’ very presence on earth reminds us that He entered into it, experiencing the pain along with us. Jesus joined us in waiting for the Kingdom, longing for the day when the need for miracles will be no more. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "What Do Miracles Teach Us About Jesus?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Colossians 1:15-20, Psalm 77:13-15, Mark 4:35-41, Luke 11:18-23, Matthew 8:14-17\n\nI once became a vegetarian just because I wasn’t fluent in Spanish. Although I’d never before considered myself a picky eater, a few weeks of traveling in a foreign country taught me that these exotic dishes were a real game-changer. \n\nOne night, I’d decided to play it safe by ordering the catch of the day. What the menu didn’t specify, however, was that not much had been done since the fish had been caught that day, leaving me with a scaly, slippery dish and two beady eyes staring mockingly back at me. \n\nThe next night, I knew better. Using my handy translator’s dictionary, I learned the word for “eyes,” and walked into the restaurant with a newfound resilience. \n\n“Ojos?” I asked with confidence, ordering the chicken this time. \n\n“No, no,” the waiter responded, chuckling. \n\nThe dish arrived just as I’d ordered it—no eyes this time, but… there were feathers. Like I was just supposed to put them in my hat and carry on. \n\nI’m the queen of asking the wrong questions. \n\nI’ve always had lots of questions about miracles. And if I’m being completely transparent, most of the time it hurts to ask them. Because while learning about Jesus’ healing power and His heart for His people, my questions inevitably turn to, Will He do this for me? or Why didn’t He do this for me? \n\nHope does not come from belief in power; it comes from trust in a Person. When we don’t understand what Jesus is doing, we must seek to know Him more. \n\nAs C.S. Lewis said, “Christianity does not involve the belief that all things were made for man.” So our first question needs to change from “What does this say about me?” to “What does this teach me about Jesus?” Or, as Mark 4 says, miracles should cause us to ask, “Who then is this? Even the wind and the sea obey Him!” (v.41). \n\nBefore we get any further into this miracle-studying business, let that be our default question: Who then is this Jesus? \n\nHe is the victorious Lord of all (Colossians 1:15).\n\nHe is Lord over creation (Mark 4:39).\n\nHe is the One who overcomes evil (Luke 11:18-23).\n\nHe is the Suffering Servant who bears our infirmities (Matthew 8:17).\n\nMiracles are breadcrumbs that lead us to the One who answers our need. They themselves are not the prize or the point, because He is already actively both. Miracles teach us that Jesus is God’s glory purposed for redemption. He came to show us His power to heal, but more importantly, to show us we’ve already been healed in Him.\n\nIf and (inevitably) when I begin to ask the wrong questions, may I look to the fullness of Christ and find that my need for Him is a privilege. May I praise Him for His miracles, but not miss the biggest miracle of all: Jesus Himself. \n\n“For God was pleased to have\n\nall His fullness dwell in Him,\n\nand through Him to reconcile\n\neverything to Himself\n\nby making peace\n\nthrough the blood of His cross\n\nwhether things on earth or things in heaven.”\n\n– Colossians 1:19-20\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Miracles of Food and Drink",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 14:14-21, Luke 5:4-11, John 21:1-11, John 2:1-11\n\nFood is an unmistakable theme in the miracles of Jesus. There is no aspect of humanity that Jesus ignored, including our need for food. \n\nJesus ate. He drank. He attended dinner parties—lots of them. The beginning of His earthly ministry included the miracle of turning water into wine at a wedding reception (John 2:1-11). And before He ascended back into heaven, He cooked His disciples breakfast with fish He’d miraculously jammed into their nets (John 21:1-14). In today’s reading, we see that He also supernaturally fed tens of thousands of followers. \n\nThis helps me to see the practical side of Jesus more clearly. Sure, His supernatural nature is awesome, and we’re keenly aware of our need to see His hand in the “big stuff.” But we tend to whizz right past the fact that He sees and responds to both our extraordinary and our ordinary needs. \n\nIn Matthew 14, we find one of Christ’s most famous miracles, what’s known as the “Feeding of the Five Thousand.” But this was actually a miracle on a much grander scale. Scripture says five thousand men were present “besides women and children” (v.21), meaning there were likely closer to 15,000 people gathered around Jesus—and He fed every single one of them until they were full (v.20). \n\nThese were people shot through with grief and sorrow. John the Baptist, one of their spiritual heroes, had just been brutally beheaded (Matthew 14:1-12). At the news of His dear cousin’s murder, Jesus retreated to a desolate place to mourn, but the grieving crowds followed Him, desperate for hope in the midst of hurt, for light in the darkness.\n\nAs their Maker, Jesus knew the crowd’s deepest needs were spiritual, yet He did not race past their immediate physical needs. In verse 14 we catch a glimpse of a thread that weaves throughout the miracles of Jesus: “When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them.”\n\nCompassion motivated Jesus to feed the crowds. He satisfied their physical hunger so they could see that He alone is capable of satisfying their spiritual hunger. \n\nIn Mark 8:1-10 we see that another crowd tracked Jesus down and remained with Him to hear Him teach for three days—without food. If He sent them home, some would faint on the way (v.3). Again, He responded with compassion, meeting their physical needs so they could digest the spiritual truths He desired to teach them. He gave them bread and fish so that they could “taste and see that the Lord is good” (Psalm 34:8). \n\nPerhaps food is just a tether keeping us close to the truth that we are not our own sustainers. Is it possible that God hard-wired our physical needs into our DNA to teach us of our bigger, constant need for Him? What if every meal were a parable teaching us that Jesus is the Bread of Life (John 6:35), the True Bread from Heaven (John 6:32), the Grain of Wheat (John 12:24), and the Living Water (John 4:10-11).\n\nJesus’ miracles are never about the miracle itself. They’re about Jesus. He doesn’t intervene in our lives primarily for our comfort, but for His glory, that we would turn to Him. Every last one of our needs points to and is met in Him. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Miracles of Land and Sea",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Trillia Newbell\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 8:22-25, Mark 6:47-52, Matthew 17:24-27, Mark 11:12-14, Mark 11:20-25\n\nIt’s scary to ask the Lord for specific and even tangible things. \n\nRecently, our pastor encouraged the congregation to pray more specific prayers. I confess that the moment he invited us into this journey, I began to doubt that God would actually hear my prayers. I usually like to manage my expectations and qualify my prayers with something like, “If it’s Your will, Lord, then…” But our pastor was calling us to more. He was calling us to faith. Since that encouragement, I’ve sought to ask Jesus to do miracles in my own my life. But I fear my faith is lacking.\n\nI relate to the fear the disciples so often display in the Gospels. They were normal people, after all, just like you and me. Although they walked with Jesus, they still struggled with unbelief (Luke 8:25). And like the disciples, when the storms rage and the winds blow and everything seems unsure in my own life, peace feels far off and unimaginable. \n\nThe unknown can be scary, but Jesus calls us to something greater than our fear. He calls us to faith. The miracles of Jesus remind us that no matter our circumstances, He proves His faithfulness over and over again. He doesn’t just offer peace—He is Peace. He doesn’t exercise His power over nature—He is Power. \n\nJesus’ miracles over land and sea are examples of the power and authority He has over the world He created (John 1:1-3). Scripture tells us that Jesus defied gravity by walking on water (Mark 6:49), and that the winds and the waves obeyed Him with a word (Luke 8:24-27). But despite all they had witnessed throughout their time with Jesus, even the disciples didn’t understand. They lacked faith and their hearts grew hard (Mark 6:52). While Jesus didn’t have to reveal His power in this way, through miracles, He did so out of His mercy for them. \n\nJust as He did with the disciples, Jesus calls us to trust Him in the middle of the storms we face. He asks us, “Where is your faith?” because what’s going on in our doubtful, troubled hearts is important to Him. He gently instructs us to “Have courage!” and reminds us that it’s because of who He is that we don’t have to be afraid (Mark 6:50). The rules of nature don’t apply to Him. The One who spoke creation into existence can also calm it with a word (Mark 4:35-41).\n\nJesus invites us to trust Him, and I long for the faith to do so. His miracles are for us, too, so that we might see and know that He is Lord. The wind may be howling, the waves may be crashing, but our God is faithful in the midst of it all. By His grace, may we have the courage to trust Him in any circumstance. May we have the faith to call out to Him, to take Him at His word, and to believe.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Christ Overcomes Evil",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nText: Luke 8:27-39, Matthew 9:32-34, Luke 11:14, Mark 7:24-30, Luke 4:31-37, Matthew 17:14-21\n\nIn the preface to his famous satirical novel, The Screwtape Letters, C.S. Lewis writes this of demons:\n\n“There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them.”\n\nWhen venturing into the territory of demons and demonic possession, it’s tempting either to write them off as ancient misdiagnoses of mental illness, or to become overly fascinated with them, attributing more power to demons than they have. Either mistake is easy to make because many of us don’t have much experience with them.\n\nAnd yet, the New Testament world seems to have been filled with demons. There was the demon-possessed man in Luke 8, whose demon went by the name of “Legion.” And there was the demon-possessed man in Luke 11, who was finally able to speak once Jesus cast the demon out of him. There was the Canaanite woman’s daughter filled with an unclean spirit (see Mark 7 and Matthew 15), whom Jesus was able to heal from afar. And there was the boy suffering from demonic seizures in Matthew 17, who was healed by Jesus after the disciples were unable to do so. \n\nThe list goes on from there, depicting a world quite different from the one we live in now.\n\nOr was it?\n\nThe truth is, our world is no less spiritual today than it was 2,000 years ago. Some cultures are simply less accustomed to recognizing the darkness and the various forms it takes. But “our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms” (Ephesians 4:16). The warfare is real and we’re called to engage it. The stories of Jesus’ power over darkness prepare us for this battle by showing us two truths.\n\nFirst, Jesus has authority over the darkness. In addition to rescuing us from darkness and teaching us how to resist it, Jesus is the King of kings, and there is nothing on this planet or in this cosmos that escapes His royal jurisdiction. As theologian N.T. Wright put it, “[Jesus] isn’t just somebody with good ideas. He isn’t just somebody who will tell us how to establish a better relationship with God. He is somebody with authority over everything that the physical world on the one hand, and the non-physical world on the other, can throw at us. This is a Jesus we can trust with every aspect of our lives.” \n\nSecond, Jesus exercises His authority with His words. Since the beginning of creation, when God spoke the world into existence, His words have had enormous power. We witness this same power when Jesus banishes each demon with a simple command. New Testament scholar Leon Morris explains, “No magic formulae, no mumbo-jumbo. He just told the spirits to go, and they went. That was what astonished people. He didn’t have to summon up stronger powers than his own; he just used the authority he already possessed in himself.”\n\nJesus’ power is a comfort to those of us in Christ. We have access to the same power and the same authority (Luke 10:19; Matthew 16:19). In Jesus’ name, we can rebuke the powers of darkness. We should acknowledge these powers exist, but we need not fear them or become preoccupied with them. Instead, let us wield our words with the same intention and precision as Jesus: creating, inspiring, building up, and fending off the darkness.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: John 9:1-41, Matthew 9:27-31, Mark 10:46-52\n\nMy preschool teacher was the first to notice my vision problems. Her suspicions were confirmed after an appointment with my eye doctor. I had a lazy eye, but the treatment was simple: wear a patch over the dominant eye to force the weak eye to strengthen. As a budding young artist, I relished the opportunity to draw a gorgeous new eyeball on my disposable eye patch each morning. I can only imagine how ridiculous I looked, but at the age of four I had little concern for appearances.  \n\nMy eyesight was corrected over time. Not surprisingly, the optometrist never pronounced, “Your faith has healed you!” Rather we assumed modern medicine deserved the credit. My physical sight was nearly perfect, but spiritually I remained blind for many years. \n\nJesus did not heal blindness the same way an ophthalmologist would. \n\nFirst of all, your eye doctor has most likely never rubbed mud on your eyes. Secondly, I doubt your eye doctor has ever discussed your spiritual sight. In my experience, she has you look through a metal contraption and asks, “Which looks better, number 1 or number 2, number 2 or number 3?” Surely this is one of the most confusing tests known to man, but it has nothing to do with your faith. \n\nWhile the multiple accounts of Jesus healing blindness did involve a physical transformation, He always acknowledged a spiritual component. Christ was not satisfied with saving the body; He was even more concerned with saving the soul. \n\nBlindness and sight, darkness and light—these are metaphors Christ often used to describe the spiritual realm. When He healed someone of physical blindness, it was also a statement regarding His power to heal spiritual blindness. \n\nPhysical healing is a wonderful gift. But if we only ask for relief from our temporary afflictions, we are not asking for enough. Jesus came so that “those who do not see will see and those who do see will become blind” (John 9:39). His miracle of sight is alive in all who believe because salvation is a miracle of resurrection. Our eyes have been opened; we were dead, but now we’re alive in Christ Jesus. Faith in Him is a gift from God (Ephesians 2:1-5,8).\n\nWhen God gives us spiritual sight, scales fall from our eyes as they did for the Apostle Paul (Acts 9:18). Our circumstances might remain exactly the same, but our perspective shifts. Where there is hopelessness, Christ offers hope. Where there is fear, Christ offers peace. Where there is hatred, Christ offers love.\n\nWe are all works in progress. None of us has 20/20 vision just yet. But we know from Jesus’ work on earth that He delights in healing our sight. We ought to pray for physical healing because the Lord cares deeply about our entire well-being. But we should pray also for spiritual sight—the miraculous gift of faith that truly saves us. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Christ Restores Broken Bodies",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melissa Zaldivar\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 5:18-26, Matthew 12:10-13, Luke 13:10-17, John 5:1-15\n\nThe migraines started in the winter. At times I was dizzy, other times nauseated, but my head was always pounding. In the summer, I sat across from a doctor as he explained that I had a rare, incurable condition called Diabetes Insipidus. Basically put, my body can’t retain water, which means if I drink a glass of water, it travels through my body in about 25 minutes. It’s an endless cycle of hydration, a thirst that’s never quenched. \n\nAt first, it was a relief just to have an answer. But over time my morale tanked and my body crashed. I found myself using most of my energy just to get the prescribed nine to eleven liters of water into my system each day. There was no cure. No rest.\n\nWhen I read about Jesus healing the man at Bethesda, I come a little undone. Not because all is suddenly well, but because I can so easily imagine the man giving up hope after living on the fringe of community for so long. What I cannot imagine is thirty-eight years of a broken body. One year has been more than enough for me, and a lifetime is far too much to think about if I want to keep my sanity.\n\nBut here’s the thing that really haunts me: Jesus says to the man, “Get up… pick up your mat and walk” (John 5:8). He tells the man to walk, but He doesn’t just mean physically. There’s always a bigger picture with Jesus. \n\nScripture tells us a Jewish festival was taking place at that time in Jerusalem (v.1). The healed man was able to attend the feast as a restored member of society, no longer an outcast. During the celebration at the temple, Jesus finds him and says, “See, you are well. Do not sin anymore, so that something worse doesn’t happen to you” (v.14).\n\nJesus is getting at something much deeper—our sweet Savior is talking about the heart, about spiritual paralysis. He says, in essence, “You think that was bad? There are far worse fates.” Jesus’ charge to walk has a much more significant meaning: to step forward in faith, repent, and believe. The physical healing was never the end of the story.\n\nWhen faced with long-term devastation, we ache because we feel that horrible tension of longing for better while living with broken. To watch Christ administer miraculous healing to broken bodies in Scripture reminds us that one day, we will all be healed and whole and well. But now, today, we live in both broken bodies and a broken world. \n\nThere are days when I go a few hours and forget that my body is broken. But there are also days when I feel myself starting to lose my grip—when I look in the mirror and think to myself, Surely, this is going to stop. And it doesn’t. \n\nSo this is what I do: I take slow, steady sips of water. I take one day at a time. And by His grace, I lean into Jesus, through the long-term illness that keeps me close to Him. When I feel paralyzed by what seems to be both a life sentence and a death sentence, I find that He is ever-present in my struggle (Psalm 46:1).\n\nJesus beckons to me in my broken, crippled body to “pick up my mat, and walk.” He invites me into faith, into a taste of eternity now in relationship with Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nScripture Reading: Mark 1:40-45, Matthew 8:14-15, Luke 14:1-4, Luke 22:50-51, John 4:46-54\n\nA skin disease, healed. A fever, touched away. A lost ear, quickly replaced. Seemingly chance encounters became life-altering miracles in Jesus’ presence. Power was oozing out of Him, and no one could stop it if they tried, though some certainly did their best.\n\nSometimes I wonder if, for Jesus, performing miracles was like breathing. Every few moments, my chest expands and contracts, taking in oxygen, transforming it, and putting it out in the world again as a different substance. Jesus inhaled and exhaled, and the blind could see and the lame could walk and the near-dead became fully alive. Lungs breathe because they’re lungs. Jesus heals because He’s the Healer. \n\nSo why did He reach out His hand to touch the leper? Why did He touch Peter’s mother-in-law to free her body of fever? Why did He touch the high priest’s servant’s ear rather than simply order it to reattach? We’ve seen how He can speak a storm to stillness or fill a net with fish, all without so much as lifting a finger. But time and time again in the Gospels, Jesus chooses to heal by touch. Why is that? \n\nThe story of the leper in Mark 1 gives us a clue. Read again with me the exchange: \n\nThen a man with a serious skin disease came to Him and, on his knees, begged Him: “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”\n\nMoved with compassion, Jesus reached out His hand and touched him. “I am willing,” He told him. “Be made clean.” Immediately the disease left him, and he was healed (Mark 1:40-43). \n\nDo you see it? It’s love. Jesus used touch to heal because of love.\n\nIt is the kind of love that looks at an untouchable beggar and is moved with compassion. The kind of love that, with a resounding yes, is willing to enter into our sickness and grief. The kind of love that brims with mercy, that would lay down self and die for literally everyone other than Himself. This is the kind of love only Christ can give. This is the love with which Jesus touched and healed those He came to save. \n\nTo be in Christ’s presence is to be changed (2 Corinthians 3:17-18). Sometimes that meant physically. Sometimes—many times—Jesus saw fit to make illness and injury disappear like that storm on the Galilean sea. And we have to assume, for reasons we’ll never understand this side of glory, that sometimes He didn’t. Sometimes He doesn’t. But His presence is no less glorious, no less affecting, no less healing if the wound or ailment remains. Love is who He is. Healing is what He does. It’s how and when He heals that’s the question; and that, like so many other things, we must leave to Him (Isaiah 55:8-9). \n\nBut here’s what we do know: He loves us. He loves us with a love that cannot be comprehended by our limited, yet remarkable, brains, with a love that cannot be conquered by anyone or anything, including death itself. Our illness and injury—be it physical, mental, or emotional—is utterly incapable of keeping us from the Savior’s love. This is His promise to us (Romans 8:35-39).\n\nWe beg, “If you’re willing, make me clean.” And He always, always answers, “I am willing. Be made clean.”  \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Christ Conquers Death",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 9:18-26, Luke 7:11-17, John 11:17-44\n\nIn Matthew 9, we encounter one of the strangest miracles recorded in the Gospels. \n\nA religious leader sought Jesus for help. His daughter was near death, and he knew Jesus could heal her. “Come and lay your hand on her, and she will live,” he begged (v.18). Jesus immediately got up and went to the girl, healing a woman along the way. “Have courage, daughter,” He told the woman, then He continued on (v.22). \n\nWhen Jesus arrived at the religious leader’s house, He made a startling pronouncement to the crowd that had gathered there: “The girl is not dead but asleep” (v.24). And do you know how that lamenting crowd responded? They laughed. We may chastise them in our heads, but can we blame them? The girl was dead, and this man arrived and proclaimed that, no, she wasn’t dead—just napping. \n\nThen Jesus did what only He can do. He brought life from death. He went into the room, took the girl’s hand, and she got up. The one whose death the crowd was grieving stood up and walked out to greet them, alive as can be. \n\nMiracles do not fit a formula. There is no incantation, no guarantee for the super faithful. The nature of miracles can be hard to understand on this side of eternity. But that’s okay, because the miracles themselves are not the point. \n\nIn John 11 we see Jesus raise His friend Lazarus from the dead. But before He does, He pauses for this brief exchange with Martha, Lazarus’ sister:\n\nJesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”\n\nMartha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”\n\nJesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life” (vv.23-25).\n\nWhen I imagine Jesus speaking these words, I suspect He put an emphasis on the “I am” in verse 25. “I am the resurrection”—as if to pose a direct challenge to the notion that He was merely the means of resurrection, rather than the resurrection in the flesh. Jesus knew the temptation we face with miracles is to desire the gift more than the Giver (John 6:26-27). He was quick to make the distinction. \n\nThe Gospel accounts of Jesus conquering death seem like the ultimate of all miracles. But really, they were only a short-term (and yes, miraculous) solution to a long-term problem. The only source of real and lasting hope is not a miracle, but the Messiah. \n\n“I am the resurrection,” Jesus said to Martha. \n\nAs glorious and dazzling as a miracle can be, it has only an ounce of the power and glory of the Savior. \n\nThis is the message behind all these earthly miracles we’ve studied: Jesus is better. Christ didn’t simply delay death a little while; He overcame it once and for all. Death has ultimately died. This we know to be true. \n\n“Have courage, daughter.” In Christ, our hope remains.\n\n",

She wants to see Truth itself, face to face.\n\nBut here, now, these things are all cloudy. Hope is tinged with hurt. Faith is shaded by doubt. Lesser, broken things masquerade as love.\n\nReal love is the God who became flesh—a living, feeling human being. He is God with us, rescuing the dying, calling the sinners, and embracing those who are wasting away. Real hope is the God who came to set things right. He came to set the cloudy mirror aside for good so we can see Him, face to face. Real Truth is the Word that created the world, the truth that never ceases to be true. Counterfeits no longer interest her; she is looking for the realest thing. This is why she reads.\n\nShe reads Truth to find Jesus.\n\nAnd He is there, on every page, greater than her triumphs and shame, vaster than her needs and her pain. Those are real, to be certain. But they are the partial, the passing away. Jesus—and Jesus alone—is the Perfect, the Permanent.\n\nThe Truth does not magically erase her suffering or cure her disappointment. It does not negate her struggle or invalidate her sorrow. It does something even better—it leads her into relationship with the One who made her and makes her new, the One who is greater than all of these. The Truth brings her face to face with the God who has never stopped loving His children, who has never failed to do what He says He will do. The Truth is love in black and white—a love that does not change, even when her Bible is closed.\n\nOne day the cloudy mirror will be gone. One day face-to-face is the only way she will see.\n\nUntil then, she reads Truth—not just for answers or equations, help or how-tos. She reads Truth to find the perfect and permanent One. She reads Truth because she needs Jesus.\n\nThe above is an excerpt from the introduction of the book She Reads Truth: Holding Tight to Permanent in a World That’s Passing Away, written by Raechel Myers and Amanda Bible Williams.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Hebrews 11:1-40, Psalm 107:1-9\n\nMy family fell apart after school on a Wednesday afternoon. That Sunday, in a new town, I woke up in a sleeping bag on a stranger’s floor. My mom, sister, and I went to a new church. And even though I hadn’t exactly met Jesus yet, this was the day I met my Boaz. My lowercase-r redeemer in more than a lot of ways.\n\nI can’t bring to memory much about that Sunday morning. I remember the 1st grade Sunday school room with tables pushed together and metal folding chairs around them in the musty basement of an old, new-to-me, church. I remember our very tall teacher and his small, kind wife and the salt-and-pepper hair on both of their heads. They tried their best to keep a room full of enthusiastic seven-year-olds quiet. Most of all, I remember the wild blue eyes and curly blonde hair of the most unruly little boy I’d ever seen. He was the ringleader of the noisy bunch, and he fascinated me.\n\nThat image of Blue Eyes standing on his chair and waving his arms in excitement over who-knows-what will forever be burned in my memory as the moment I met my future husband. Of course, I didn’t know it at the time. I probably thought I was meeting my nemesis. Everything I loved about order was the opposite of him. He was loud, and I felt quiet. Everyone was looking at him, and I’m not sure anyone even noticed me. I didn’t know it that seven-year-old Sunday morning, but Blue Eyes would never stop being a part of my life from that moment on.\n\nThere is truth (our present circumstance), and there is truer truth (the history of God’s unwavering, faithful, covenant relationship with His people). Call it the “grand scheme of things” if you like, but I believe we make a big mistake when we trust God only based on what He’s done for us today, or even in our own lifetime.\n\nIf a telescope zooms our gaze in on one particular thing, God’s Word is like a wide angle lens that shouts, “Remember! God is THIS BIG! He is a God of the big-picture!” When we’re busy dialing in on legitimately important things like jobs and health and deadlines, it can do us a lot of good to remember what God did at creation, and what He promised Abraham. Remember how He kept His hand on Joseph, bringing Israel into Egypt and eventual slavery, then delivering them from slavery at the hand of Moses. All the while He promised on every page that an even bigger plan was unfolding!\n\nThis is what the Bible does. This is why we read Truth.\n\nIt’s okay to study God’s hand in our present circumstances. It’s good and appropriate to move that telescope around to see what other people are dealing with too. But opening God’s Word and studying His character is like lifting our eyes from the viewfinder long enough to remember that the God who calls us His people has been hanging the stars in the heavens since time began. \n\nJust as He was faithful then, He will be faithful now.\n\nThe above is an excerpt from Chapter 1 of the book She Reads Truth: Holding Tight to Permanent in a World That’s Passing Away, written by Raechel Myers and Amanda Bible Williams.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hosea 2:14-23, 2 Corinthians 1:19-22\n\nI’ve been a believer in Jesus since I was five years old.\n\nWe were standing toward the front of our United Methodist chapel, singing from a hymnbook in the pews, my mom and my brother and me. I don’t remember what preceded the moment, but I remember feeling sure that Jesus was real. And I remember feeling sure that I wanted to serve Him. So I closed my eyes and held out my hands, palms up, like I was holding a serving tray. It was exhilarating.\n\nThis was my version of Moses’ “Here I am” (Exod. 3:4). This was childlike faith in its uncomplicated beauty.\n\nAs I grew, my faith grew too. We attended church regularly, and I was as involved as I could be. I went to Sunday school and Bible studies and summer youth trips. I read the Bible outside of church too. I began to journal my prayers. But even as I became more sure of who God was, I became less sure of who I was in relation to Him. The little girl who stood unabashedly before God, eager hands ready to serve, became a teenager who hid like Mother Eve beneath fig leaves of shame.\n\nIt was no longer Moses’ “Here I am” that I echoed in my heart. It was also his disbelief: “Who am I that I should go?” Or, as was more accurate to my line of thinking at the time: who am I that I am worth loving?\n\nThe fullness of the gospel had saved me, but I only seemed to remember half of it.\n\nI knew I needed to be forgiven, but I couldn’t believe I was.\n\nI knew God’s love was deep, but I thought my sin was deeper.\n\nI knew Christ accepted me, but I didn’t imagine He’d accepted all of me.\n\nI was a work in process, and I assumed the work was mine to complete. I was a well-intentioned mess, and I thought the mess was mine to clean up.\n\nBut guess what? That wasn’t Truth. God never said I have to clean myself up before I come to Him, to get it right before I trust in Him. He never said I could not or would not be a work in process. Search for these commands in the Bible, and you will come up short.\n\nIn fact, God says the opposite.\n\nThe Bible is full of in-process people, those whom Christ pursued and loved exactly as they were, well-intentioned messes like me. Like you. If we need permission to be in process, we can look to Scripture.\n\nI am the woman at the well, taken aback that this man would dare to be seen with me.\n\nI am Zaccheus, standing at a distance and hoping to catch a glimpse of the Messiah.\n\nI am Peter, promising I would never deny Him and then turning around to do exactly that.\n\nI am Peter, weeping when I meet Jesus’ eyes and realize that I have failed and failed big, again.\n\nI am Martha, running around trying to guarantee my worth and everyone else’s happiness.\n\nI am Mary, collapsing at His feet because I am so desperate for His presence.\n\nI am the adulterous woman, standing guilty for all the world to see.\n\nI am the bleeding woman, utterly incapable of healing what ails me.\n\nI am a mess, in process, just like all of them. Looking through its pages, I see pieces of me all through God’s Book.\n\nIn God’s Word I’m reminded that I don’t secure my standing before Him by any guarantees I make, or even those I manage to keep. I am secure because He holds me in the safety of His covenant, the same covenant He has kept for generations past and will keep for generations to come.\n\nThe above is an excerpt from Chapter 3 of the book She Reads Truth: Holding Tight to Permanent in a World That’s Passing Away, written by Raechel Myers and Amanda Bible Williams.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: 1 Samuel 2:1-2, Isaiah 40:3-8, 1 Thessalonians 5:16-24\n\nThere was a time not long ago, a season I’ve described in these pages, when anxiety and false expectations covered me like a weighted blanket. As if the oxygen had been sucked out of every room, I couldn’t catch my breath. Then, slowly, the blanket began to lift. Inch by inch it lifted and the air rushed in—when my family loved me anyway, when the doctor understood, when the church held us up, when the long winter finally gave way to spring— until one day I could breathe again. Not the shallow gasps I’d become used to, but deep, lungs-full, eyes-clear breaths. It felt like coming back to life.\n\nThat heavy quilt of circumstance was real and it was stifling, but the gospel was always true, even when the heaviness covered me.\n\nThe gospel is not only for the moment Christ calls us to repent and follow Him. It is for every moment before and every moment after.\n\nIt is for our times of joy and fervor, and our times of doubt and despair.\n\nIt is for the day we stand basking in the bright light of hope, and the day we hide, head in hands, in the dark corners of our fear.\n\nIt is for the hour that just passed and the hour to come, the situation we just stepped out of and the one we’re walking into.\n\nWe need it every minute. The gospel is our oxygen.\n\nBut, here in our temporary home, the gospel can seem intangible and hard to hang on to. So where do we turn when the heavy blanket is closing in, when we’re in the dark, gasping for air?\n\nWe turn to God’s Word.\n\nWhen we turn its pages and take in its Truth, the very breath of God fills our lungs, our heart, our mind, our soul. Whether we come to Him doubting, praising, weeping, laughing, His Word is for us and it is true. In this ever-fading world, God’s Word never fades. We can approach it in any condition, under any circumstance, and IT IS STILL TRUE.\n\nWhen our will is weak, God’s Word is true.\n\nWhen our faith is fragile, God’s Word is true.\n\nWhen our hearts are heavy, God’s Word is true.\n\nWhen we wonder if we even believe it, God’s Word is true.\n\nThe gospel is permanent, even when our belief buckles under the world’s weight.\n\nThe gospel is the reason we can take Paul seriously when he writes, “Rejoice always! Pray constantly. Give thanks in everything” (1 Thess. 5:16–18). It is the reason we can put away our faith formulas and walk side by side with the One who wrote faith into our stories and has promised to finish what He started. It is the reason a girl who’s made promises to God and broken them all can wake up each new day and invite hundreds of thousands of women to read Truth—the truth about the promise God has made to them, and even to her, and how He has kept and still keeps it, every day.\n\nI am basking in the bright light of hope today, but that weighted blanket may be waiting in the wings. Maybe you’re under it now. Jesus promised His disciples they’d have trouble, and we’re guaranteed to have it too (John 16:33; 1 Pet. 4:12).\n\nDarkness and death are weighty, and our emotions, our actions, even our beliefs may bend at their pressure. But our God does not. Even under the blanket, we can echo the prayer of Hannah:\n\nThere is no one holy like the Lord.\n\nThere is no one besides You!\n\nAnd there is no rock like our God (1 Sam. 2:2).\n\nLet your chest rise and fall today with the knowledge that the gospel is true. It is oxygen, available every moment of every day, and you can breathe it in. \n\nThe above is an excerpt from Chapter 8 of the book She Reads Truth: Holding Tight to Permanent in a World That’s Passing Away, written by Raechel Myers and Amanda Bible Williams.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Luke 12:4-7, John 3:16-17, 1 Peter 1:3-9\n\nWe took our kids to Disney World for spring break this year.\n\nSince we believe ourselves to be the “go big, just once” type of Disney-goers, rather than the “go briefly and often” type, we booked seven days of park-hopping magic, determined to experience every inch of every park at least twice. Ultimate Disney satisfaction. And, as it turns out, exhaustion.\n\nDisney World is a crowded place. With the spring break crowds added to the mix, we quickly discovered a natural human reflex we called the “Disney Grasp.” By hour six of day five, somewhere between Splash Mountain and Casey’s Corner, Oliver registered a polite complaint, “Mom, I don’t like the way you’re holding my hand. It’s just kind of straight and floppy—I need you to squeeze your fingers around mine.”\n\nThis would have been a darling request in any other setting, but his hand was sweaty, and my fingers were tired and a little stiff from five days straight of hand holding (punctuated, of course, by the thrill of waving freely in the breeze on a fun rollercoaster ride for three minutes every three hours). Oliver wanted me to squeeze with meaning, and at that moment, all I really wanted was to find a quiet place and not be touched or talked to for just a minute.\n\nOf course, I complied. He didn’t want to hold my limp-fish hand and I wanted him to feel secure. I would continue to forget his preferred squeeze-level, however, and he would have to reach across his body and wrap my fingers back around his every hour or so for the rest of our trip. He knew my hand was tired, and I knew he wanted to be held tight, and so I thanked him for reminding me and readjusted my grip.\n\nParent-child relationships can be beautiful examples of how we relate with God. But when it comes to the realities of permanent and passing away, even the most enduring love of a parent cannot hold up. I love my son like crazy, and it is my job to keep him safe, but my hand eventually gives way. I get tired and I forget to hold him tight.\n\nIt’s not that way with God.\n\nBecause everything in this world is fragile, there is no real-life metaphor for holding tight to something that is actually secure. We hold out of fear, we grip out of anxiety or prevention, and we eventually lose our grip every time. But because the gospel of Jesus Christ is permanent, it is not subject to the same shortcomings of anything that is passing away.\n\nHear that. The gospel is not passing away.\n\nGod does not let go.\n\nThe very nature of the gospel is different than anything else around us. Scripture calls our gospel inheritance “a living hope.” Not a dying hope. The apostle Peter describes it as, “imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you.” And the hope of the not-passing-away gospel is literally being “guarded” by God Himself (1 Peter 1:3–5).\n\nGuarded in heaven by God’s own power. No wonder He tells us not to fear. No wonder He promises we can stake our lives on His Truth. This is why God told Abram, “Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.” It’s why the angel of the Lord said to Mary, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people” (Luke 2:10, emphasis mine).\n\nThe gospel is good news. It is not scary news.\n\nThe gospel calls us to hold tight. But it also reminds us that we are already being held.\n\nThe above is an excerpt from Chapter 9 of the book She Reads Truth: Holding Tight to Permanent in a World That’s Passing Away, written by Raechel Myers and Amanda Bible Williams.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Matthew 5:1-16, 1 Chronicles 16:28-34, John 16:22-24\n\nBlessed are the spiritual zeros—the spiritually bankrupt, deprived and deficient, the spiritual beggars, those without a wisp of ‘religion’—when the kingdom of the heavens comes upon them.\n\n– Dallas Willard, The Divine Conspiracy\n\nAs believers in Jesus and His gospel of grace, we stand with one foot in the present and one in the future. In the present, right-here world, life is volatile and uncertain. And yet, we know the saying is true: This world is not our home. Our citizenship is in a greater, coming Kingdom—a Kingdom we will only know in part while we live here on earth (Philippians 3:20).\n\nSo how do we do that? How do we live in two worlds at the same time? How do we live in the reality of this present, imperfect world in light of the heavenly life to come?\n\nAt the beginning of Jesus’ longest recorded sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, He speaks eight blessings to the crowd. These blessings, known as the Beatitudes, shed light on the tension you and I are living in as women who trust our Savior, yet face actual pain, poverty, emptiness, and all manner of brokenness in our right-now lives. \n\nThe temptation is to see this list of blessings as a formula to a better, happier life. But as Dallas Willard puts it, “The Beatitudes simply cannot be ‘good news’ if they are understood as a set of ‘how-tos’ for achieving blessedness. They would then only amount to a new legalism” (Willard, Divine Conspiracy). So if the Beatitudes aren’t how-tos, what are they? Put simply, they are facts. They are truths of the kingdom of God.\n\nBecause of the finished work of Jesus on our behalf, the Beatitudes are not a mere wish list or to-do list; they are the blessings that are already ours in Christ. In the vast love, grace, mercy, and goodness of our Savior, the least are given the Kingdom. Those who hunger and mourn, the poor and the meek, the “spiritual zeros”—we are blessed with the riches of Christ. Not just later, but right now, right here. \n\nNo matter how comfortable the house, we’ll never feel fully at home in this world; we were made for the coming one. But while we’re here, we have a job to do. Our job is not to earn our blessings; Jesus did that. Our assignment is to be salt and and light to the very world that makes us fidget with discomfort. As those who carry the life of Jesus around in us, we have a message of hope to offer a dying world (2 Corinthians 4:10). We hold out the Word of Life, inviting our neighbors “to taste and see that the Lord is good” (Psalm 34:8).\n\nAs we study this short but impactful passage at the beginning of Matthew 5, may our hearts assume a posture of gratitude toward the God who grants us His very Kingdom through the life, death, and resurrection of His Son. And as we give thanks for the blessings that are secured for us in Christ, may we be quick to scatter the knowledge of Jesus to those around us.\n\nThe Kingdom is His, and all are welcome. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Matthew 5:3, Ephesians 2:1-10, Revelation 3:17-22\n\n“He only who is reduced to nothing in himself, and relies on the mercy of God, is poor in spirit.”\n\n-John Calvin\n\nWhen we were first married, we spent half a year working for a company after they stopped paying us. We had signed a contract for a year, but halfway in they came upon hard times, and the paychecks just stopped. We were committed to the project, had a little money saved up, and didn’t really know what to do, so we finished the contract.\n\nNow that we are older, a little less idealistic, and more laden with responsibilities, we probably wouldn’t be able to manage that. Granted, the word “poor” is relative, and short of insurmountable homeless starvation, we’re all holding on okay. But during that particular season, we were poor. \n\nI don’t like to be poor. I don’t even like to feel poor.\n\nMoney is an insulation from the world. We use it to keep from feeling hungry, cold, and sad. Strength and power insulate us, too—all these things give us the illusion that we are in control. But the “poor in spirit” are those who have no power; they are the demoralized, the dejected. They can be fiscally poor, or lonely, or rejected; but regardless, they have lost all hope of finding power in themselves. \n\nIn the eyes of the world, the poor in spirit are the lowest of the low. People who can’t help themselves, or people who don’t believe in themselves, must not deserve all the good things life has to offer, we reason. We put so much value on hard work and grit that the poor in spirit are the most undervalued members of society.\n\nBut that’s the upside down version. The world is upside down, but Christ sets things right again. When He said “the last shall be first,” He meant it (Matthew 20:16). The poor in spirit have nothing, but that nothingness empties them of the illusion of their own power, enabling them to rely wholly on God. And to those who totally rely on Him, God gives the earth as an inheritance. He doesn’t promise that they’ll conquer the earth in their own power, somehow taking it for themselves; they will inherit the earth. For the meek, the earth will come to them gently, naturally, like a bequest. The world is upside down, but God sets it upright again.\n\nIn an unexpected way, we suddenly have reason to be grateful for the absence of paychecks, the blindsiding blows, and the losses that reduce us to emptiness. Poverty of the heart forces us to rely on the mercy of God. Jesus says they are “blessed” and “happy” who find themselves poor in spirit. Without our insulating security we have no refuge but God, and that blessed contradiction is a glimpse of what earth will look like, right side up, as it is heaven (Matthew 6:10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebekah Lyons\n\nText: Matthew 5:4, Isaiah 61:1-3, Romans 7:21-25, 2 Corinthians 7:8-10\n\nFifteen years ago, during a bleak February chill, I awoke early and jumped in the shower, ready to head back to the hospital. I’d been without our firstborn son—still less than a week old—for almost eight hours. And it was killing me.\n\nThe phone rang, and I heard Gabe answer. I knew it was the doctor calling with the lab results. Sixty seconds crawled by before Gabe cracked open the bathroom door. Seeing the look on his face, I collapsed. \n\nThere will never be words to describe the pain I felt at that moment. I had no idea I was capable of such grief, yet there I was, wailing. I could not shed the anguish fast enough. \n\nGabe and I drove to the hospital in silence. I realized I didn’t know a single person with Down syndrome. I was ashamed I’d overlooked this community, a sorority of mothers whose children had Down syndrome—a sorority to which I now belonged. \n\nSome people have been taught that the Christian life makes no room for sadness, gives no permission to mourn, allows no time for lament. This kind of mental toughness might seem a practical approach for immediate survival, but unexpressed grief can become a bitterness that chokes us. When we dull our pain, we dull our joy. When we numb our lows, we numb our highs. \n\nJesus has a different perspective on grief. He never lacked emotion or expression. He “was a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief” (Isaiah 53:3). And in His impassioned Sermon on the Mount, He gives us this promise: “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted” (Matthew 5:4).\n\nWhen we grieve—not if—we will be comforted. \n\nNot long after His sermon, Jesus experienced this for Himself. “He took Peter and Zebedee’s two sons, James and John, and He became anguished and distressed. He told them, ‘My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me’” (Matthew 26:37).\n\nJesus wept from empathy, from disappointment, from pain. He mourned, and when He was finished mourning, He surrendered to the work of God—work that brought great freedom to all of us. \n\nSince that fateful February morning, I’ve grieved with friends who have walked through fear and loss. Loss of love and marriage vows. Loss of sanity and peace. Loss of life, in the womb and out. And I’ve watched those same folks experience the death of their own will, and by His grace, receive Jesus’ comfort instead. \n\nNone of us wants to encounter such deep grief in our lifetimes. But the more we mourn our sin and need, pain and loss, the more we can trust and anticipate the gracious comfort Christ Jesus promises to bring. \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nText: Matthew 5:5, Luke 12:13-21, Psalm 37:1-11\n\nThese days my daughters have been struck with a heavy dose of the equine magic, something unknowingly passed down from their mama, I suppose. As a child, I whiled away many an afternoon hour at the dining room table, painstakingly working to capture the essence of a mare and her young colt. Occasionally, they’d take flight as a pegasus or grow into a purple-horned unicorn. But more often than not, I fashioned my horses a traditional brown or black—always majestic, racing through a large Crayola®-green pasture, wild, free, and unbridled. \n\nFueling my wonder was a racehorse farm, just down the road from my childhood home. On slow summer mornings, my mother would walk with me, hand-in-hand, to admire the horses. Together, we’d watch them from the outside of endless white fences, their tails flick-flick-flicking away flies in the heat. On rare occasions, she’d lead me to the stables for a closer look, to stroke their muzzles, my fingers tentatively dancing across a velvety smooth coat. I’d stare deeply into the eyes of those beautiful beasts, in awe of their quiet, controlled demeanor—steely strength enveloped in a gentle disposition. \n\nThough humble in temperament and committed to the service of their master, you’d never doubt the power of these statuesque creatures. You would never think them weak. These animals are bred, born, and groomed for a few minutes of all-out greatness, and yet the day-to-day submission of their own will to that of their master’s is somehow equally awe-inspiring. The master has proven to be good and worthy of their trust. And so they wait on him. \n\nCommit your way to the Lord;\n\ntrust in Him, and He will act…\n\nBe silent before the Lord and wait expectantly for Him…\n\n-Psalm 37:5,7\n\nThis is a picture of meekness: strength and power under control, submitted to the authority of the Father. He created us to bear His image and to bring Him glory (Genesis 1:27; Isaiah 43:7). And while we can honor God in deed and action—in how we run the race—we also glorify Him in our waiting and trusting in Him. We glorify Him in our meekness, too.\n\nScripture tells us Moses was the meekest man on the face of the earth, but he was far from weak (Numbers 12:3). The man who confronted Pharaoh, led the Israelites’ exodus out of Egypt, and parted the Red Sea, was empowered by God Almighty to lead and perform miracles in His name, yet he remained humble in spirit. He was just a foretaste of Jesus Christ, our Savior to come (Matthew 11:29). \n\nHe was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a lamb that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers, So He did not open His mouth.\n\n-Isaiah 53:7\n\nJesus had all the authority of heaven and earth given to Him, yet He submitted His will to the Father (Matthew 28:18). The same God who met face to face with Moses endured the cross for the joy set before Him (Hebrews 12:2). He did it for us—we are His joy, His prize. This is the God who fights for us; we need only to be still and wait for Him (Exodus 14:14). \n\nWe live in a world that distracts us from our true inheritance. At every turn, we’re told to make our desires happen now and on our own terms. But that’s orphan living, and we are daughters of the King. All that He has is already ours in Christ Jesus (2 Peter 1:3). Our inheritance is already secure.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Matthew 5:6, Matthew 7:7-11, Romans 9:3-33, Romans 10:1-4, Psalm 17:15\n\nWe can’t get Harvey to stop eating green acorns in the backyard. Yes, specifically the green ones, and no, his stomach does not agree. \n\nThe main reason our goldendoodle puppy keeps finding acorns is because, well, it’s fall and they’re everywhere. He sniffs them out with the same tenacity I use when looking for a stray piece of gum in my purse. Before you know it, he’s crunch-crunch-crunching away. Again. \n\nWe’ve scolded him repeatedly, enrolled him in puppy school, and used lots of bribery. But when it’s not green acorns, he’s gnawing anything from a wooden armchair to a human hand, and at that point, I’ll take the pesky acorn any day. All the while, he ignores his full bowl of dog food, and although I haven’t tasted it myself, I’ll bet it tastes better than all those other things. When will he learn to eat the right things? \n\nBetter yet, when will we?\n\nI’m hungry all the time. Of course, my stomach rumbles when I don’t eat breakfast or eye the pint of ice cream in the fridge, but it’s even more frequent than that—I’m ravenous for approval, control, love, and fulfillment. Instagram likes, friendly compliments, and foolproof plans are my foods of choice. Before I know it, I’m crunch-crunch-crunching away. Again. \n\nBut even after gorging myself, I am still unsatisfied and on to trying the next thing. Anybody else? Friends, we, too, are missing the satisfaction already set out for us—in Christ. \n\n“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.”\n\n– Matthew 5:6\n\nI tend to picture the person who hungers and thirsts for righteousness as a total kill-joy, as if this verse is telling them—and us—to go on a strict righteousness cleanse. But it’s not! No, it’s  inviting us into something so much better. Paul explains the distinction like this: “Because they disregarded the righteousness from God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves to God’s righteousness. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes” (Romans 10:3-4).\n\nIf we are left to feed on our own righteousness, we will starve. But when we feed on the righteousness of Christ, we will be satisfied. On the cross, Jesus knew He was the only thing that would satisfy, and even in our longings today, it still rings true. We cannot create or earn righteousness on our own; we can only partake in the gift of His. \n\nIn contrast to our worldly desires that leave us longing and hungry for more, our satisfaction in Christ only increases with our hunger for Him. The more we seek first the kingdom of God, the more we will be fulfilled by His goodness—a taste of eternal satisfaction in the life to come. \n\n“But I will see Your face in righteousness;\n\nwhen I awake, I will be satisfied with Your presence.”\n\n– Psalm 17:15\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: Matthew 5:7, James 2:15-20, Matthew 18:21-35\n\nI recently deleted the Facebook app from my phone in an effort to scroll less and live more. I’ve begun to realize how often I scroll and just how terrible it makes me feel. A quick scan of my social media feed this morning inspired plenty of emotion in me, but not an ounce of understanding, compassion, or grace. \n\nWe live in a time of outrage, not of mercy. \n\nReading all these passages about mercy, then writing about it and thinking about it, only made me more confused. It’s like when you stare at a word so long that, suddenly, it no longer seems to be spelled correctly, or the true meaning of the word escapes you altogether.\n\nSo what exactly is mercy? And why do I see so little of it in my own heart for others?\n\nAfter thinking it over and working through these scripture passages, this is the best I’ve got: mercy is standing before someone who deserves punishment, and then throwing them a party instead. You’d think it would be easy to accept a free party. But we’ve all been taught from an early age that “there’s no free lunch.” How can we live in a world of dollars and cents, blame and responsibility, and yet still accept mercy? \n\nThe story in Matthew 18 shows just how hard that is. We’re not told why this man had so much debt, but it’s probably safe to say he over-leveraged himself or gambled his way into oblivion. He did something that the rest of the world—from a place of safety or self-righteousness—might call foolish. And yet the king took pity on him, forgiving not only his debt, but also the character flaws that had landed him in debt in the first place. \n\nBut when the forgiven man walked out of the king’s presence, he made a beeline for the first person he could think of who owed him money. What if the king were to change his mind? Perhaps next time, the king won’t be so merciful. And so, loved by a king, the man became a tyrant.\n\nFurthermore, his beliefs about the king became a self-fulfilling prophesy. He didn’t trust mercy, so he didn’t extend mercy, which landed him in prison—exactly where he’d expected to end up all along. When he reached prison, I imagine he felt justified: I knew he’d come after me all along.\n\nThis man’s behavior is familiar territory. At times, I find that I expect God to come back around, change His mind, and demand payment for all of my mistakes. Worst of all, I believe the difficult situations that come my way are His punishment in disguise, rather than believing the circumstances of my life are God’s best for me. But God has no punishment left for us (Romans 8:1).\n\nGod is not waiting for me to mess up. He is not standing, ready with a long list of all my other failures, to justify why the mercy I thought I received didn’t actually count. Jesus loves me—and you—fully, deeply, permanently. It is final and it is finished (John 3:16; 19:30). \n\nThinking through all this helps me to see myself and the people around me with new eyes. It even changes the way I look at my Facebook feed, believe it or not. There is no one we’ll encounter today, on our social media feeds or elsewhere, who is not in need of mercy. And you and I have the privilege of extending it to them, because Christ has secured irrevocable mercy for us.\n\n",

Instead, it was just me… and the scratching. And the hives.\n\nThe minute the itchiness ensued, I immediately began washing all my clothes and sheets, then used every last drop of my brand-new bottle of soap in the shower. But it got worse, sending me to the farmacia, which was closed, followed by the doctor’s office, all the while accompanied by a translator who did not know the word for “hives.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time I’d taken matters into my own hands, working to scrub away my flaws for a pristine exterior. Just today, I’ve held doors, given compliments, and tweeted Scripture—which are all good things, but my motives are off. And do you know what I see when I do these things? Nothing. I’m hiding so well that I don’t see a thing—not myself, and definitely not God. \n\nSitting in the doctor’s office chair, I listened to the translator and the doctor intensely converse, unable to decipher what they were saying. Then, the translator turned to me, diagnosing an allergic reaction to an ingredient specific to Italian soap and detergent. \n\nWhat I’d been using to hide and treat my condition was actually the root of my problem. My attempts to outwardly correct my inward shame had only exposed it more. \n\nWhen I read, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (Matthew 5:8), I’m sent scrambling, trying to scrub my heart of its impurities. Reading that verse makes me want to work harder and look better. But in reality, I start to hide more, feel less, and then wonder why I can’t see God in the midst of my shame.\n\nI want to see Him. I want to see Him so badly that I’ve shamed my sinful heart into hiding. But Praise the Lord, He is not hiding from us, and nothing is hidden from Him. God sees us and knows us long before we could ever think to seek Him. He saw us first. \n\nFor “Man does not see what the Lord sees, for man sees what is visible, but the Lord sees the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7). He sees us when we are impressive, as well as indecent. He knows our hiding places and wants to give us a better one (Psalm 32:7). \n\nWhile we are busy trying to correct our outward behavior and conceal our inward brokenness, we miss the work God is already doing:\n\n“For I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.”\n\n–Ezekiel 36:24-28\n\nBy His grace, may we stop hiding from Him in shame, and instead turn to face the One who has already blessed us with the purity of Christ and washed us clean.\n\n \n\n",

I shared the space with my twin sister, Nikki. With four elbows, four knees, and twenty fingers and toes jammed into such cramped corners, I doubt peace was a part of my prenatal development. I’ve been fighting for peace in my relationships ever since. \n\nYou too?\n\nI’m not sure where we got the impression that once life reaches a certain cruising altitude, we can wave goodbye to turbulence. Every era in history is marked with wars and rumors of wars, and every decade of our lives brings its share of tensions, squabbles, and cold shoulders. Turmoil is a constant in our changing world. Jesus was not naïve to this reality. He calls us to pursue peace anyway. \n\nIf you read through the Beatitudes as a list of dos and don’ts, you might find yourself tripping on this one: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God” (Matthew 5:9). \n\nAre you able to change the habits that wreak havoc on your relationships? If you were, you would have done it already. \n\nAre you able to force reconciliation between your bickering children or squabbling neighbors? Probably not. There’s strike two. \n\nAre you able to resolve the conflicts raging across the geopolitical landscape? Nope. Strike three!\n\nBut where we are weak, Christ’s power is made perfect (2 Corinthians 12:9). The gospel never fails to shoot up a beacon of hope. \n\nThis list of blessings handed down from Jesus goes far beyond a checklist for right living. It lays the groundwork for the gospel. We can’t begin to get relief in our relationships or to move toward others in reconciliation without first looking to the cross. \n\nTrue peace is a byproduct of Christ’s work of the cross. True reconciliation begins with His work on our behalf, then bubbles over into our connections with each other. We can only be peacemakers by carefully following Christ’s lead. \n\nApart from Jesus, we were once left in a sorry state: separated, alienated, hopeless strangers— alone (Ephesians 2:11-12). “But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility” (vs. 13-14). \n\nApart from Christ, all of life is war. We war within ourselves as we rebel against God’s best. We war against others as our sin sends shrapnel into one another’s hearts. The cross is the only bridge to true peace. \n\nThe beautiful message of the gospel is that Jesus Himself is our peace. The cross worked like a sledgehammer, tearing down the wall of hostility we erected with our own sin. He simply asks us to wave the white flag of surrender to His work of reconciliation. \n\nThis reminder gives us what we need to pursue reconciliation with others. The grace that has been lavished upon us gives us the strength to extend grace to others. We can forgive because we’ve been forgiven, pursue peace because we serve the Peacemaker, mend broken relationships because we’ve been stitched up with the thread of grace. \n\nThis process of pursuing reconciliation also gives us a taste of what’s to come; it’s a preview of an eternity marked with perfect peace. Hostility will end. Tears will dry. Apologies will become antiquated. Those of us who have surrendered our lives to the Peacemaker will be blessed indeed.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nText: Matthew 5:10-12, Philippians 1:27-30, 2 Timothy 3:10-17, 1 Peter 1:6-7\n\nThe internet is not for the faint of heart. Maybe you’ve noticed this, too. Behind the protection of a computer screen and social media, people lose their inhibitions and speak with a recklessness they wouldn’t otherwise. Strangers, acquaintances, and even friends launch virtual grenades that leave behind very real wounds.\n\nI learned this lesson the hard way, soon after I started writing. Each week, I poured my heart and soul into words about Jesus, hoping to build up my readers while challenging them in their faith. I studied and prayed and edited and dreamed, and then, I released my ideas into the world. I remember hitting the “publish” button one of those first very times and, thirty minutes later, a comment appeared from one of my precious readers: “The author sounded whiney.”\n\nCome to find out, this would be one of the gentler comments in a string of skin-thickening insults. It was my cold-splash initiation into the world of writing online, a world that is sometimes beautiful and sometimes brutal.\n\nThese experiences have taught me a lot over the years, but one lesson always stands out. When someone insults you, there is a subtle temptation lurking just behind it: to tear your critic down in the form of sympathy. “He is probably just a sad person,” or “Hurt people hurt people,” or “She’s just jealous.” I have said all of these things and more, and some of those assessments might even be true. But Jesus’ response to insults looks radically different.\n\nIn Matthew chapter 5, Jesus doesn’t focus on His critics’ motives. Instead, He points to the kingdom of God: “You are blessed when they insult and persecute you and falsely say every kind of evil against you because of Me. Be glad and rejoice, because your reward is great in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you” (vv. 11-12).\n\nIt doesn’t matter how you were brought low—you meek, you downtrodden, you spiritual misfits—because God works wonders among the lowly. If people slander you or insult you because of Christ’s name, you don’t have to cower and you don’t have to flee, because the other side of death is always, always resurrection. Not around the shame, but through it.\n\nThis, in many ways, is the entire message of the Beatitudes.\n\nBut the news gets even better. This Kingdom isn’t some far-off reality. We’re tasting it now. The blessing is already here. We rejoice, not because the reward is distant, but because it’s near. Amidst the insults, the name-calling, the persecution and the slander, God does some of His very best work. He heals. He humbles. He overcomes strongholds. He seizes our fragile idols and shatters them on the ground. He takes our shame and our humiliation and He makes them submit to His reign. And that, my friends, is why we rejoice.\n\nWe don’t have to be afraid. We don’t have to feel threatened or timid about the truth, as if we have to defend it, or ourselves, to keep our joy. The Beatitudes remind us that God’s upside down Kingdom doesn’t work that way. God’s ways are higher than our ways, and our call is to bear witness to that truth. \n\nWe don’t have to let the fear of insult or persecution sway us from obedience. Instead, we can step into it with confidence, knowing God’s good plans for the persecuted. Even in our hurt and shame, the Kingdom is breaking in, and our lives are a big, bright flashing signpost beckoning the world to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Matthew 5:13-16, Colossians 4:5-6, Isaiah 42:5-9\n\nYou know that scene in It’s a Wonderful Life where George and Mary help the Martini family move into their new home? They load up the Martini children (and goat) into their car and drive them to Bailey Park, entourage-style, a truck piled high with the family’s belongings following behind them. As the townspeople gather triumphantly on the stoop of the Martinis’ new home, Mary offers this housewarming blessing:\n\n“Bread, that this house may never know hunger. Salt, that life may always have flavor.” Then George jumps in and takes over because he just can’t help himself: “And wine, that joy and prosperity may reign forever!”\n\nI’ve always loved that scene. It’s so hopeful, so filled with joy and promise. We want to believe that George and Mary’s best wishes can bestow true blessing on the young family, but we know the turmoil that lies ahead for the small, fictional town. Like the folks of Bedford Falls would discover, we know best wishes don’t bring life. Only God can do that.\n\nThat’s what we find when we read the Beatitudes: blessings only God can give, promises only Jesus can make. These aren’t just promises for our future—though they are certainly that. They are promises for our right-now life. They are promises of God’s kingdom come here on earth as it is in heaven.\n\nThis is the gospel. Sinners—ordinary, imperfect people like you and me—are ushered into the kingdom of God by none other than God’s own Son. Jesus came to this pain-ridden planet and lived the holy, sinless life we couldn’t, then paid the debt of our sin in full on the cross. Three days after it was finished, He walked out of the grave, and He sits at the right hand of His Father even now. And there, now, He claims as His own—holy and blameless children of the Father—we who accept the absurd gift of His grace.\n\nWe are heirs with Christ to God’s kingdom. We belong there. It is our home.\n\nWe mourn the pain and death and injustice of our right-now world, but we rejoice in the One who will dry every tear (Revelation 21:4). We are poor in spirit, in possessions, in esteem, yet we are filled up by the One who created all things and holds all things together (Colossians 1:16-17). We hunger for a holiness that we can’t reach here, while we give thanks to the One who clothes us in His righteousness (Romans 5:17). We ache for mercy and peace in a warring world, and we worship the One who is setting everything right (Revelation 21:5).\n\nWe are children of the Kingdom—not just when we leave this world, but right here in it.\n\nThe gospel of Jesus is not a secret to be kept. It is the conspicuous, live-changing reality for every single person who calls Christ their Lord. It is the very definition of good news! How can we help but overflow with gratitude and love for the God who has rescued us from despair and secured our hope?\n\nOur God has made us a beacon of hope to the world, “a covenant for the people and a light to the nations, in order to open blind eyes, to bring out prisoners from the dungeon, and those sitting in darkness from the prison house” (Isaiah 42:6-7). We are light bearers, sight givers, and freedom bringers—this is our reality in Christ. \n\nFriends, we have so much more to offer the world than our best wishes. We know the Maker of love, the Giver of life. When others look at us, may they see Him. Amen. \n\n",

So unspeakable, he would never disclose it; he would only say this: “Something happened to me, which was known only to myself, and which caused me the most severe mental suffering. The hymn was the fruit of that suffering” (Dough 111).\n\nThe hymn was “O Love That Will Not Let Me Go,” which famous American hymnwriter Fanny Crosby would affectionately call her favorite (112). \n\nCrosby and Matheson had something unique in common: they were both completely blind. Born with sight, Matheson’s eyes began failing over the course of his childhood, and he was fully blind by the age of eighteen. But that did not stop young George from pursuing what he loved. Coming from a wealthy merchant family in Glasgow, Matheson studied at the University of Glasgow and graduated with honors. He went on to become an influential pastor, leading a congregation of 2,000 members at St. Bernard’s Church in Edinburgh. \n\nBelievers from all over Scotland made the trek to St. Bernard’s to hear the blind preacher deliver his passionate messages from the pulpit, and congregants from all over the world sing his famous hymn to this day. Still, none but God and George himself will ever know what happened on that day in Innellan, as the man sat alone and furiously penned the words of this beloved hymn, the verses coming to him as if dictated by someone else. “It was the quickest work I ever did in my life,” he would later say. “I am quite sure the whole work was completed in five minutes” (111). \n\nThe Cross, the Joy, the Light, the Love—these were the truths that held tight to a Scottish pastor as he suffered through a pain he could not bear to name. They are the truths that hold us too.\n\nO Love That Will Not Let Me Go\n\nGeorge Matheson; Albert L. Peace\n\nO love that will not let me go,\n\nI rest my weary soul in thee;\n\nI give thee back the life I owe,\n\nthat in thine ocean depths its flow\n\nmay richer, fuller be.\n\nO light that foll’west all my way,\n\nI yield my flick’ring torch to thee;\n\nmy heart restores its borrowed ray,\n\nthat in thy sunshine’s blaze its day\n\nmay brighter, fairer be.\n\nO joy that seekest me through pain,\n\nI cannot close my heart to thee;\n\nI trace the rainbow through the rain,\n\nand feel the promise is not vain\n\nthat morn shall tearless be.\n\nO cross that liftest up my head,\n\nI dare not ask to fly from thee;\n\nI lay in dust life’s glory dead,\n\nand from the ground there blossoms red\n\nlife that shall endless be.\n\nDough, Whitney J.

Music composition was his passion, but he didn’t have a piano in his tiny new abode. \n\nWhen a neighbor offered a dusty organ with cracked leather and stiffened stops for the price of five dollars, Haldor eagerly bought the wheezy organ and set about composing. As he settled into family life, he wrote many songs on that first, imperfect instrument. \n\nOne of the early compositions Haldor wrote on that five-dollar organ was “Wonderful Grace of Jesus,” which he, in turn, sold for five dollars (Brown 117). This small investment helped him write more songs, better songs—over 4,000 hymns in his lifetime—and he went on to found his own music publishing company.\n\n“Wonderful Grace of Jesus” is a triumphant song about the abundant grace of Christ (1 Timothy 1:14), one that is deeper than the sea and higher than the mountains.

From what we know of his life, “My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less” was just as much an anthem of his own testimony as it has become for believers all over the world. \n\nHaving grown up knowing nothing of God or His existence, Mote first attended church and became a Christian as a young adult. While still a new believer, he was compelled to try his hand at hymn writing. Thus, Mote wrote from a basic, yet profound understanding of his salvation. \n\nLater that same week, he visited a married couple at the wife’s sickbed. Without a hymnal handy to lead them in a song of worship, Mote produced a folded-up piece of paper upon which he had worked out four verses and a chorus. Together, they sang the hymn now known as “My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less” for the first time, blessed by the truths of God’s Word in the lyrics.   \n\nTwenty years later, as a Baptist minister, Mote was instrumental in securing a building for his congregation. As a show of thanks, the congregants offered to put the deed in his name, but Mote refused, saying, “I do not want the chapel. I only want the pulpit; and when I cease to preach Christ, then turn me out of that!” (Dough 72). Mote understood the profound simplicity of what remains secure and what will always be slipping away.\n\nChrist is the sole means of our salvation.

A scraggly and rebellious teenager in Southampton, England, Watts was a poet who refused to sing psalms in church because they didn’t rhyme. \n\nWatts’ lyrical appreciation and incessant poetics were an annoyance to everyone around him, including his own preacher father, who threatened to whip his son if he continued his daily rhyming. The son replied, “O Father do some pity take, and I will no more verses make!” (McKay 67). \n\nAfter his anger subsided, Watts’ father challenged his writer son to create something “better” than King David’s psalms. At just 18 years old, Watts began writing hymns that were loosely rooted in the Psalms and aligned with his own singing preferences (which, of course, included rhyming). He aimed to communicate timeless gospel truths in contemporary language, as if King David was writing in the present-day 1700s (Watts 15).\n\nHis hymn “O God, Our Help In Ages Past” is based on Psalm 90:4:\n\nFor in Your sight a thousand years\n\nare like yesterday that passes by,\n\nlike a few hours of the night.\n\nWhen Watts’ signature style is applied to this passage, it becomes a singable hymn: \n\nA thousand ages in Thy sight\n\nAre like an evening gone;\n\nShort as the watch that ends the night\n\nBefore the rising sun.\n\nWhether sung in original psalmic context or modern rhyming prose, the importance of recalling God’s character remains the same.

From out in the dark waves they heard cries for help from a boy struggling to stay afloat. Her husband ran into the water to rescue him. But despite his efforts to bring the boy back to shore, both he and the child drowned.\n\nShocked, grieving, and penniless, Louisa and her daughter struggled in the years that followed. The tragedy of her husband’s death weighed heavily on her, both as a mourning wife and as the unexpected head of household. She didn’t have money for food, and their hungry days passed slowly, sustained by a quiet faith in God’s goodness in spite of their dire circumstances.\n\nOn a day that began like any other, Louisa heard a sound at the door. Upon opening it, she found a solitary parcel on her front doorstep. Not seeing anyone around, she looked inside and discovered a small gift of food and money (McKay 89). That same day she penned the words, “‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, just to take Him at His word.” \n\nLouisa’s life gives a powerful testament of simple yet mighty faith in Jesus. Her story reminds us that, even in the scary and sad places, God is surely our salvation. We can “trust and not be afraid” (Isaiah 12:2). Let us take Jesus at His word and believe that He will care for us.\n\n‘Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus\n\nLouisa Stead\n\n‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,\n\nand to take him at his word;\n\njust to rest upon his promise,\n\nand to know, “Thus saith the Lord.”\n\nRefrain:\n\nJesus, Jesus, how I trust him!\n\nHow I’ve proved him o’er and o’er!\n\nJesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!\n\nO for grace to trust him more!\n\nO how sweet to trust in Jesus,\n\njust to trust his cleansing blood;\n\nand in simple faith to plunge me\n\nneath the healing, cleansing flood!

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText:  Genesis 1:26-31, Job 28:12-28, John 1:18\n\nWalter Chalmers Smith set out with lofty goals when he sat down to write the words to “Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise.” Although it later became his most famous hymn, he was hesitant to complete it, and spent almost forty years revising, reconsidering, and researching before it reached its final form.\n\nDuring those years of meditating on what it means for God to be both immortal and invisible, Smith ministered at five different churches throughout Europe. As he honed his preaching skills, he also practiced his skills as a poet. His prolific collection of poetry reflects on the depths of human sin and the heights of God’s inexpressible greatness (Bailey 456).\n\nSmith’s love for poetry emboldened him to explore his desire to know the unknowable. He used phrases like “light inaccessible hid from our eyes” in an attempt to describe the indescribable. Job used the same kind of paradoxical phrases to explain the reach of an eternal God, who “fixed the weight of the wind” (Job 28:25).\n\nThrough his struggle to express the inexpressible, Smith created a unique hymn. He invited his parishioners to join him in singing about the deep mystery of a God who is both intimate and ineffable. \n\nSmith’s forty-year journey to settle on lyrics for this one hymn is a profound testimony to the mystery of our immortal, invisible God. Even as we spend years of our lives meditating on His character, may we never cease to be awed by the Ancient of Days.\n\nImmortal, Invisible, God Only Wise\n\nWalter C. Smith\n\nImmortal, invisible, God only wise,\n\nin light inaccessible hid from our eyes,\n\nmost blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,\n\nalmighty, victorious, thy great name we praise.\n\nUnresting, unhasting, and silent as light,\n\nnor wanting, nor wasting, thou rulest in might:\n\nthy justice, like mountains high soaring above,\n\nthy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.\n\nTo all, life thou givest, to both great and small;\n\nin all life thou livest, the true life of all;\n\nwe blossom and flourish like leaves on the tree,\n\nthen wither and perish, but naught changeth thee.\n\nThou reignest in glory, thou dwellest in light,\n\nthine angels adore thee, all veiling their sight;\n\nall praise we would render; O help us to see\n\n’tis only the splendor of light hideth thee!\n\nBailey, Albert Edward.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Job 12:7-12, Psalm 148:1-14, Matthew 6:26\n\nOf all the monastic saints, we see reminders of Saint Francis of Assisi the most. He is immortalized in backyards everywhere as a stone lawn statue, usually cradling a bird or comforting a fawn. And there is truth behind the sculptures; Francis was actually very well known for his care and attention to animals. In fact, his enthusiasm for preaching the gospel and his love for animals occasionally drove him to go so far as to preach sermons to flocks of birds. \n\nIn 1226, with his vision failing and his life nearing its end, he wrote a poem titled “The Canticle of the Sun.” In his weakened state, he celebrated the psalmic call for all creation to praise God as Creator (Psalm 19).\n\nSaint Francis was always keen on unity with nature. In fact, in his original version of this hymn he referred to creation as family: brother sun, sister water, brother fire, mother earth, brother wind, and sister moon (Bailey 264). Although some English translations maintain those sentiments, when William Draper translated it from Latin to English in 1910 for a children’s festival, he paraphrased the original poem, leaving out references to any familial relationships with creation. \n\nWe can all join with creation to say, “Hallelujah!” and praise God for His creative goodness. We can sing with the psalmist in Psalm 148, praising God with the stars and the waters, the sea monsters, lightning, and clouds. Let us join together to praise and honor the Lord of heaven and earth.\n\nAll Creatures of Our God and King\n\n William Draper\n\nAll creatures of our God and King,\n\nlift up your voice and with us sing:,\n\nalleluia, alleluia!\n\nO burning sun with golden beam,\n\nand shining moon with silver gleam,\n\nO praise him, O praise him,\n\nalleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n\nO rushing wind so wild and strong,\n\nwhite clouds that sail in heaven along,\n\nalleluia, alleluia!\n\nNew rising dawn in praise rejoice;\n\nyou lights of evening find a voice:\n\nO praise him, O praise him,\n\nalleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n\nCool flowing water, pure and clear,\n\nmake music for your Lord to hear:\n\nalleluia, alleluia!\n\nFierce fire, so masterful and bright,\n\nproviding us with warmth and light.\n\nO praise him, O praise him,\n\nalleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n\nEarth ever fertile, day by day\n\nbring forth your blessings on our way;\n\nalleluia, alleluia!\n\nAll flowers and fruits that is you grow,\n\nlet the his glory also show;\n\nO praise him, O praise him,\n\nalleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n\nAll you who are of tender heart,\n\nforgiving others, take your part;\n\nalleluia, alleluia!\n\nAll you who pain and sorrow bear,\n\npraise God and on him cast your care;\n\nO praise him, O praise him,\n\nalleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n\nLet all things their Creator bless,\n\nand worship him in humbleness,\n\nalleluia, alleluia!\n\nPraise, praise the Father, praise the Son,\n\nand praise the Spirit, Three in One:\n\nO praise him, O praise him,\n\nalleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n\nBailey, Albert Edward.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Russ Ramsey\n\nText:  Exodus 24:3-8, Romans 5:6-11, Hebrews 9:15-22\n\nThe hymn “Nothing but the Blood” was composed by Robert Lowry (1826-1899), a university professor and Baptist preacher from New England. \n\nAlthough an accomplished musician, Lowry wanted most to be known as a preacher. He said, “Music, with me has been a side issue… I would rather preach a gospel sermon to an appreciative audience than write a hymn. I have always looked upon myself as a preacher and felt a sort of depreciation when I began to be known more as a composer” (Butterworth 165). \n\nHis preference for preaching comes through in the way his most popular hymn plays like a sermon. The hymn utilizes a call-and-response pattern similar to that of Psalm 136, in which the leader of the assembly makes a statement about God, and the people respond, “His steadfast love endures forever.”\n\nThe lines of the hymn alternate—the odd lines asking essential questions about what reconciles us to God, while the even lines respond with the same refrain: “Nothing but the blood of Jesus.” The chorus, then, draws the musical sermon together, reminding us why the blood of Jesus is so necessary: “Precious is the flow that makes me white as snow. No other fount I know. Nothing but the blood of Jesus.”\n\nBy design, call-and-response hymns lead believers to confess their faith together. May we sing such songs over one another. And may “the message about the Messiah dwell richly among you, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, and singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, with gratitude in your hearts to God” (Colossians 3:16). \n\nNothing but the Blood\n\nRobert Lowry\n\nWhat can wash away my sin?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nWhat can make me whole again?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nRefrain:\n\nO precious is the flow\n\nthat makes me white as snow;\n\nno other fount I know;\n\nnothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nFor my pardon this I see:\n\nnothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nFor my cleansing this my plea:\n\nnothing but the blood of Jesus.

Regardless, the gospel truths echoed in this hymn belong to all of us, those who are childlike in both stature and faith (Bailey 184). \n\nToday, this hymn remains a strong, timeless invitation and prayerful response to the imagery found in Psalm 23. While the psalmist affirms the Lord’s faithfulness and goodness, the hymn writer actively calls upon God out of personal need. When coupled together, the psalm and hymn serve as a call-and-response: \n\n“The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I lack” (v. 1).\n\nSavior, like a shepherd lead us, much we need Thy tender care.\n\n“He lets me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters” (v. 2).\n\nIn Thy pleasant pastures, feed us.\n\n“He renews my life; He leads me along the right paths for His name’s sake” (v. 3).\n\nFor our use Thy folds prepare:\n\nBlessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,\n\nThou hast bought us, Thine we are.\n\nOur endless call to our Shepherd is that of lost, needy, hungry children, and His response is love. We are His lambs—tender, wandering, forgetful—and yet He leads us still. He is our sure comfort and restful pasture. May we continually recall God’s character and call out for His faithful response.   \n\nThou hast loved us, love us still.\n\nSavior, Like a Shepherd Lead Us\n\nBy Dorothy A.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Psalm 27:4-6, Psalm 45:1-17, Isaiah 33:17\n\nAs sweet as a lullaby, “Fairest Lord Jesus” seems like a delicate hymn for rosy-cheeked children. But it has a surprising and legendary German history, originally sung as a far rougher, more warlike battle hymn.\n\nLegend has it that the hymn originated in the 12th century as a Teutonic Knights’ anthem sung in Prussia under the Holy Roman Empire, or as an 18th century tune from the Germanic region of Silesia. Either way, the current tune carries the rousing moniker of “Crusader’s Hymn” (Brink 62).\n\nThis is due in part to Franz Liszt, prodigy pianist and world-renowned composer. He used this tune in his 1862 oratorio, “The Legend of St. Elizabeth,” as the battle march for his costumed crusaders. Suddenly, this quiet, lullaby of a song appeared in an entirely new light, all dressed up and armed for war. \n\nWith a closer look, we see this is true for many hymns and truths of the gospel as well. They can be sung gently and reassuringly, for we are God’s children, and we desperately need the comfort and beauty of this promise: “to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, gazing on the beauty of the Lord” (Psalm 27:4).\n\nBut the gospel is also a clarion call to the safety of our Lord in battle: “For He will conceal me in His shelter in the day of adversity; He will hide me under the cover of His tent; He will set me high on a rock” (Psalm 27:5-6). Thanks be to God, who preserves us and fights for us. And thanks be to Jesus, our Savior, the ruler of all nature.\n\nFairest Lord Jesus\n\nBy Joseph A.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nText: Genesis 3:8-19, John 20:30-31, Galatians 2:1-9\n\nIn anticipation of the ‘Acts of the Apostles’ reading plan—the She Reads Truth summer study beginning on June 6—we’ll spend this week in ‘Countdown to Acts’, a 5-day introduction establishing the historical and geographical context of the book. Read along with us as we set the stage with the people and places significant to the beginning of the early church. ‘Countdown to Acts’ is also available free on the She Reads Truth app. \n\nThe narrative arc of the Bible is told in essentially three movements:\n\n1.     The Old Testament: the story of our creation and fall, and of God’s promise to redeem His people.\n\n2.     The Gospels: the story of God’s promise fulfilled through Christ’s life, death, and resurrection. \n\n3.     The Book of Acts: the story of Jesus’ impact on the world as His followers took the gospel message to Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. (The only narrative portion of the New Testament not covered in Acts is John’s imprisonment and revelation on the island of Patmos.)\n\nThe book of Acts is not the end of God’s story, but rather the beginning of how the church found its way around the world and down through time to the places where we live and worship today.\n\nAuthor: Though the book of Acts specifies no author, earliest records attribute the book to Luke, who also wrote the Gospel bearing his name. Luke’s name appears three times in Paul’s prison letters (Col. 4:14; 2 Tim. 4:11; Phml. 1:24), indicating he was one of Paul’s traveling companions. Colossians 4:14 also identifies Luke as a doctor, which is supported by the way Luke uses specific medical language (e.g. Acts 28:8).\n\nDate: Both the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts are believed to have been written at the same time, during the early to mid 60s, likely during Paul’s imprisonment in Rome. The events in Acts take place after the death of Christ in AD 33 and conclude in AD 62.\n\nTheme: The book of Acts emphasizes the work of God through the Holy Spirit in the lives of people who devoted themselves to Jesus Christ—especially Paul, as he led the Gentile missionary endeavor. The Christian church was built, city by city, through the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit working through God’s chosen vessels.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nText: Colossians 3:1-17\n\nOne of the most beautiful outcomes of the spread of the gospel is how the redeeming work of Jesus Christ unifies people across lines of ethnicity, gender, and class. \n\nActs was written during a time when people were more divided than perhaps any other era in history. But the gospel of Jesus Christ unified those who were separated by culture, race, and social standing. For those living in first century Rome, this unity was not only beautiful, it was astonishing. Acts repeatedly calls this to our attention by identifying people not just by name, but by their people group, to show us how the gospel unifies them.\n\nHere is a brief overview of the key people groups named in Acts:\n\nJews / Hebrews / Israelites: Descendants of Abraham, and inheritors of God’s covenant. Devoted to the Law given to Moses at Mount Sinai (Genesis 17).\n\nGentiles: Literally, “the nations,” or everyone who was not Jewish. Romans, Greeks, and “barbarians” were regarded by most Israelites as “unclean” (Acts 10:45, 13:48, 14:4-7).\n\nGod-Fearers: Gentiles who worshipped Israel’s God but had not converted to Judaism, and did not adhere to the Jewish laws about food or circumcision (Acts 13:16, 13:26).\n\nRomans: Roman citizens protected by Roman law; had legal rights in the Roman Empire. Citizenship could be obtained by birth, and a ruling of law (Acts 22:25-29).\n\nGreeks: People born in Greece, or Greek-speaking people living in the eastern part of the Roman Empire (John 7:35).\n\n",

In that sense, the progression Jesus described is precisely what we see happen in the book of Acts as the gospel spreads from Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria to the ends of the Roman Empire. Since that time, the gospel has traveled around the globe many times over.\n\nIn terms of our present-day geography, here are some key places where the events of Acts took place:\n\nJerusalem: Roughly the same city as the one established during King David’s reign. As Israel’s capital city, Jerusalem is the heart of Jewish history and culture.\n\nJudea: The southern half of present day Israel—stretching from the Jordan River and Dead Sea west to the Mediterranean Sea, and from Gaza and the Red Sea north to Tel Aviv. It became a Roman province in 6 AD.\n\nSamaria: The northern half of present-day Israel, reaching from the Jordan River west to the Mediterranean Sea. Samaria was home to descendants of the Israelites who intermarried with their Babylonian captors during exile. These “Samaritans” were shunned by many traditional Jews.\n\nAsia Minor: The region of Paul’s 1st Missionary Journey—modern-day Turkey and Syria. Asia Minor included the regions of Phrygia, Pisidia, Galatia, Cappadocia, and Cilicia, and the cities of Derbe, Lystra, Ephesus, Colossae, Miletus, Philadelphia, and Antioch.\n\nMacedonia and Achaia: The regions of Paul’s 2nd and 3rd Missionary Journeys—modern-day Romania, Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Greece. The regions of Macedonia and Achaia included the cities of Thessalonica, Philippi, Berea, Athens, and Corinth.\n\nRome, Sicily, and Malta: The same as today. Sicily and Malta are the two islands just off the toe of Italy’s “boot.” Rome was the power center and heart of the vast Roman Empire.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nText: Romans 13:1, John 11:45-53, Acts 28:17-28\n\nThroughout the book of Acts, Israel was under Roman rule, which had been the case since Rome wrested the region from Syria in 64 BC. During the New Testament era, the Roman Empire ruled most of the known world.\n\nLegend tells us that Rome was founded by Romulus and Remus in 753 BC. The first seven kings of Rome increased the size of the kingdom by conquering neighboring territories. But eventually, a tyrannical king named Tarquinius Superbus drove the people to revolt. After this uprising, Rome became a republic which gave her citizens a voice in political and national affairs. As a republic, Rome grew even more powerful, reaching well beyond the borders of Italy into Africa, Asia, and Europe.\n\nAs anyone who has ever read Shakespeare knows, Roman leadership became increasingly unstable as the Empire grew larger. Ambition, paranoia, distrust, betrayal, and a lust for power made it very difficult for anyone to govern with stability for any length of time. Positions of authority in Rome had a high turnover rate due to assassinations, promotions, demotions, and transfers of power.\n\nBy the time Rome took occupation of Israel, the Empire was large, but spread thin. Israel’s location was strategic. It lay at the crossroads between Europe, Asia, and Africa. Ruling Israel meant Rome would be able to move freely between the continents.\n\nThe Jews were defined by their worship, their temple practices, and their history as followers of one God, and one God only—Jehovah. Rome knew that devotion like this was hard to extinguish, so they reckoned it would be politically wise to leverage Israel’s religious zeal as motivation to live at peace with their occupiers. Rome arranged a compromise. Israel could continue to practice their monotheistic religion so long as they obeyed Roman rule, paid their taxes, and kept the peace.\n\nThis was a shrewd psychological move. Under this arrangement, many in Israel came to see their right to worship God as a privilege that was now granted to them by Caesar, who could take it away if they fell out of line. We see this on display during the Triumphal Entry, when the Jewish religious leaders pleaded with Jesus to tell those laying down their palms and coats to stop referring to Him as a king. If Roman authorities heard this was happening, they might have shut down the Passover celebration (Luke 19:37-40).\n\nUnder Roman law, Jews were given certain rights that made the arrangement more palatable. For example, they were excused from military service and from ever having to appear in court on the Sabbath. By the time we come to the book of Acts, the dealings between Jews and Romans were predominantly positive.\n\n",

Early on, the Roman Empire regarded Christianity as a sect of Judaism, which explains why Rome tended to treat conflicts between Jews and Christians in Acts as internal matters (Acts 18:12-17).\n\nEarly Christians did not oppose Roman authority. Jesus taught His followers to pay their taxes (Mark 12:17). Paul and the other apostles taught that Christians should honor the government so long as Roman authorities didn’t forbid them from following Christ (1 Tim. 2:1-2, 1 Pet. 2:17). Because of this, early Roman persecution of Christians was more the exception than the rule.\n\nThere were, however, a few notable tumultuous periods. For example, shortly after Jesus’ birth, Herod the Great, in his zeal to kill the one born “King of the Jews,” slaughtered all Hebrew male children under age two (Matt. 2:13-16). Later, in 64 AD, Emperor Nero blamed the great fire of Rome on Christians. It may have been during Nero’s persecution when both Paul and Peter lost their lives.\n\nChristianity spread throughout the Roman Empire and, according to Romans 15:28, a Christian church existed in the city of Rome itself as early as 50 AD—less than 20 years after the death and resurrection of Christ. It is fascinating to consider how the Roman occupation of Israel—something most Israelites viewed as an unfortunate hardship—would end up setting the table for the gospel to spread from Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria to the ends of the earth.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nText: Exodus 1:1-22, Exodus 2:1-22, Acts 7:23-29\n\nA malicious villain, an endearing protagonist, an impossible circumstance, and an unsuspecting hero—these are some of the elements we’ve come to expect from a good story. But for me, the best part of a story is a great rescue—because in every great rescue, there’s a moment of great faith. It’s the moment when it seems there’s no way out, like the villain is going to have his way. \n\nOf course, I also dread those moments because they’re suspenseful, terrifying, and sometimes brutal. The protagonist comes to a point where she has to depend on something greater than herself, to have faith that a deliverer will come to her rescue.\n\nThe Israelites had reached that point. Enslaved by the Egyptians for 400 years, they had been subjected to harsh labor and treated ruthlessly. And if that wasn’t enough, their children were being murdered! The darkness and oppression surrounding Israel during their time in Egypt is unfathomable.\n\nGod had promised to make them into a great nation and to bless all the nations of the world through them (Genesis 12:1-3). But how was this going to happen when they were enslaved? \n\nEnter Moses, a man whose life was marked by the Lord from birth (Exodus 2:1-10). God chose this man to deliver Israel, and He gave him a desire to protect them. But Moses was a complicated, imperfect, temperamental man who once killed an Egyptian he saw beating an Israelite. In a panic, he fled the scene and headed for Midian, where he saved seven young women from some ill-intended shepherds. See? Complicated. When God opened Moses’ eyes to the oppression of his people, his heart was moved to defend them, however imperfectly (Exodus 2:11-17).”\n\nMoses was God’s chosen deliverer, born to save the Israelites. In him, God continued to fulfill His promise to bless all nations of the world through Abraham’s offspring. Israel’s deliverance through Moses pointed directly to our coming deliverance through Christ.\n\nBoth Moses and Jesus were born under an edict of death, as both Pharaoh and Herod ordered the murder of all male children under two (Exodus 1:22, Matthew 2:16). God called Moses and the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, and He called Jesus up out of Egypt after Herod’s death (Exodus 3,14; Matthew 2:19-21). The Israelites did not initially recognize Moses as their deliverer, just as the people didn’t understand that Christ had come to deliver them from sin and death (Acts 7:25, Matthew 12:38-40).\n\nEvery deliverer in the Old Testament, including Moses, foreshadowed our ultimate Deliverer, Jesus Christ. And every act of deliverance in our past is a promise from the Lord to also deliver our future.\n\nFriends, our deliverance—from whatever it may be—is already in the works. Just as the Lord had a greater purpose for Israel’s oppression (Genesis 15:13-16), He has a greater purpose for our suffering, too. Deliverance might not look like we expect, and might not come exactly when we hope, but it is coming. Even when we can’t see God working, when we feel like He no longer sees us, He’s working for our deliverance (Isaiah 64:1-4).\n\nAs we study the life of Moses together, let us be reminded of the deliverance we already have in Christ Jesus. May our eyes be opened to the way the Lord is working on our behalf, right now, in whatever our circumstances may be. \n\nLet’s trust His past faithfulness for our future deliverance. May this be for us a moment of great faith in our own rescue story.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Annie Downs\n\nText: Exodus 2:23-25, Exodus 3:1-22, Mark 12:18-27\n\nIt’s all about the details, right? It’s the difference between getting to church at 11:00am and 11:10am. Or getting on I-75 South instead of I-75 North—just a small detail that landed me in the wrong state.\n\nBut it’s also in the details of a sunset, or a marriage proposal, or the secret ingredient of the best meal you’ve ever eaten. (IT WAS THE SAFFRON!) The details make all the difference.\n\nThey say the devil is in the details, but more often than not, I find that God is there, in the tiniest of details, waiting for us to notice Him. It happens ALL the time in the Bible, when a small detail changes everything.\n\nThis particular story of Moses has one of those tiny details I’ve overlooked for years. I grew up in the church, and I’ve known the story of the burning bush for as long as I can remember. I can picture it on the flannel graph: the multi-colored flames in the corner, Moses facing it, shepherd stick in hand, and shoes off to the side, because—as it says in Exodus 3:5—he was standing on holy ground.\n\nBut go back to Exodus 3:4, just one little phrase before. There’s this one tiny detail that changed the whole story for me.\n\n“When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, ‘Moses! Moses!’” (Exodus 3:4).\n\nIt wasn’t until Moses noticed the bush on fire that God spoke out of it.\n\nGod wasn’t calling Him like you call the kids in from the playground. The bush wasn’t yelling out Moses’ name like he was the next contestant on a gameshow. It was when Moses noticed—when he went over to look—that God spoke to him.\n\nLook around you. What are the little moments, the details, the things God is waiting for you notice? What’s your burning bush?\n\nA neighbor?\n\nA place of worship?\n\nA sunrise?\n\nA blog post?\n\nA church you’ve wanted to visit?\n\nA restaurant you’ve always wanted to try?\n\nI often go walking at Radnor Lake here in Nashville. I walk the same path every day, the one that starts on the right and loops around the lake. About halfway through, there’s a little sign with an arrow pointing to another path: Ganier Ridge. I’ve seen it lots of times, but I’ve always just kept on walking—even though it caught my eye more and more each time I passed it.\n\nOne Saturday, I finally quit ignoring that little nudge and turned up that path. It was hard and steep, and it only got steeper as I climbed. WHY AM I DOING THIS? I thought, as a podcast about loving your city well played in my ears.\n\nAt the apex of the climb is a clearing, and when I reached it I paused by a bench to catch my breath. And then I saw it: the entire Nashville skyline, right there in my view. There’s the city I love, I thought, as the podcast reminded me that God places people in their cities on purpose.\n\nHe wanted me to hear it while I was seeing it. Once I noticed the “burning bush,” and walked toward it, He spoke to me. It wasn’t a huge deal, but it mattered to my heart.\n\nWhat is the thing God is using to get your attention? I bet it’s different from the things He uses to grab mine—but that’s okay, because it’s meant for you, not me.That’s where God wants to talk to you. That’s where He has something just for you, if you’ll turn and notice and listen.\n\nTHAT’S your burning bush.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebekah Lyons\n\nText: Exodus 4:1-17, Hebrews 5:1-6\n\nI love Moses. He’s such a beautiful picture of needing everything God offers. \n\nAnd I love reading about Moses’ first encounter with the God of the universe, burning in a bush. The dialogue between them makes me laugh because Moses’ reluctance is so relatable to me. His objections remind me of my own.\n\nGod: Go to Pharaoh so that you can bring my people out of Egypt.\n\nMoses: What? Who, me?!\n\nGod: I will be with you.\n\nMoses: What if they ask who sent me?\n\nGod: I Am has sent you.\n\nMoses: What if they don’t believe me?\n\nGod: I’ll give you the power to perform signs and wonders in My Name.\n\nMoses: But I’m not good with words.\n\nThis is where I can imagine God saying slowly and firmly, “Moses, who made your mouth? Go! I’ll help you speak, and I’ll tell you what to say” (Exodus 4:1-13, my paraphrase).\n\nIt’s easy to read about Moses’ doubt and think, This is God speaking to you! Don’t you trust Him? After all, even God Himself was angry with Moses (Exodus 4:14). But then I think of all the times I’ve determined God must have confused His plans for me with His plans for someone else. I’ve offered up plenty of, You’ve got the wrong girl! I can’t do this! Just look at my mess…  \n\nI often wonder what God is thinking as He listens to my fears and protests of never-enough-ness. The writer of Hebrews offers us some insight into this:\n\n“For every high priest taken from men is appointed in service to God for the people, to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins… No one takes this honor on himself; instead, a person is called by God, just as Aaron was” (Hebrews 5:1,4).\n\nGod does the choosing and the assigning—not us. He calls us, and He equips us. There’s no need to run from His calling, to deny it, or wish it away. Because “the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus” will also “equip [us] with all that is good to do His will, working in us what is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ” (Hebrews 13:20, 21).\n\nJesus breathes His power through our frailty in ways we can’t imagine. It’s because we have our own weaknesses that we’re able to love others well, to deal gently with those we encounter (Hebrews 5:2). In fact, this is the only thing we can boast in: His power is made perfect and on full display in our never-enough-ness. When we are weak, we are actually made strong in Christ Jesus (2 Corinthians 12:9-10). \n\nWhoa. The secret to strength is weakness.\n\nGrasping this has been a game-changer for me. I used to think my shortcomings disqualified me from serving Him. But I’ve learned that when I admit my inadequacy, I invite God’s power in to strengthen me. This is fertile soil for surrender. Surrender says, The calling You’ve laid before me is too great. I cannot fathom it. Still, I will obey. I will trust that You go before me.\n\nWhen God equips us, He also strengthens us. And in that strength, we realize that we, the weak ones, have been a part of God’s plan all along. \n\nSo if you’re feeling not-enough today, take heart. The God who was faithful to equip Moses and used him to deliver the Israelites, will surely strengthen and provide for us as well.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: Exodus 4:18-31, Exodus 5:1-23, Exodus 6:1-13\n\nWhen was the last time you had one of those days where things seemed to go from bad to worse?\n\nMy most recent one started with a phone call from my mother. She called to tell me my grandmother had only a few hours left to live. I immediately picked up my laptop, abandoned my latte, and headed out of the coffee shop, rushing to get home and start packing. I’d driven to the edge of the parking lot when a passerby mimed for me to roll down the car window.\n\n“Your tire,” he said. “You know it’s flat?”\n\n“Yeah,” I lied, heartbroken. “I know.”\n\nThat evening, my grandmother passed away. It was sudden. Shocking. The older I get, the more I brace myself for times like these. When it rains, they say it pours. And when things are hard, it’s possible they’re about to get a whole lot harder.\n\nThings were bad for the Israelites: enslaved, baking bricks in the hot sun, suffering from ridicule, racism, and genocide. The news Moses brought was like salve to the their ears. Hearing that the Lord saw and remembered them, had seen their misery and was concerned about them, they bowed down and worshiped Him (Exodus 4:31). But little did they know, things were about to go from bad to worse.\n\nThe Lord’s plan was coming into fruition, though it wasn’t all rosy. The signs “I AM” gave Moses included blood and snakes and leprosy. And as Moses opened his mouth to speak, he watched Pharaoh’s grip tighten around the necks of the Israelites, the people he’d been sent to save.\n\nCan you imagine? The situation was so ridiculous—so absolutely fraught with hatred—I wonder if any of the Israelites had to laugh in the midst of their tears. They were already slaves, already broken, ridiculed, and beaten. And now, this? No straw? Forcing a slave to gather his own straw was like asking a construction worker to make his own boards.\n\nThe rug was being pulled out from under the Israelites, and let’s be clear: God was doing the pulling—not because He was cruel or cold-hearted or enjoyed watching them suffer. He did it because He loved the Israelites too much to leave them in slavery.\n\nAfter living under Pharaoh’s oppression for so long, enslavement had started to feel normal. It had become the everyday rhythm of the Israelites’ lives. They had forgotten what it means to be free. So God’s first step in freeing them was to make slavery even more unbearable. In His mercy, He lifted the veil from their eyes and made it clear: there was no future for them in Egypt.\n\nGod does the same for us. His concern and love for us dictate that He use all means necessary to wake us out of the acceptance of our own slavery—to comparison and greed, lust and selfishness and joylessness—whatever it may be. In His mercy, God refuses to let us bear it any longer.\n\nHere’s a hard truth: God’s mercy does not require His treatment of us to be comfortable or safe (Deuteronomy 8:2-3). But in the midst of our pain, God’s plan is still good and His promises remain true. He will deliver us. He will free us. He will redeem us (Exodus 6:6). And come what may, He promises to be with us (Isaiah 43:2).\n\n“I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”\n\n-John 16:33\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Genesis 1:1, Exodus 7:1-25, Exodus 10:21-29, Psalm 105:27-36\n\n“I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night and strike every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. I am Yahweh; I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt.”\n\n—Exodus 12:12\n\nI thought about Egypt a lot as a kid—though growing up on the Great Lakes, I was about as far from the Nile as you can get. Our house had an attic with a low ceiling and one dim light, and I was afraid to poke my head inside because I was sure I would see the Anubis. Have you ever seen a drawing of this creature? It’s a man, with the head of a jackal. For me, there’s nothing so terrifying as a man’s figure walking upright wearing the head of a jackal. Why did the Egyptians have to put animal heads on their gods?\n\nThe pantheon of false Egyptian gods was a terrifying mix of half-human, half-sacred animals;  because in the absence of the one true God, we can only invent gods in our own image, or in the image of things we see around us. False gods are just imitations of the natural world. The Egyptians created supermen, but that’s all they were: imagined concoctions of everyday things elevated to the rank of deity. \n\nEach major aspect of Egyptian life was tied to a specific god. For example, Hapi was the god of the Nile River. The welcome seasons of flooding and the dreaded seasons of drought were linked to the the vagrancies of his changing moods.\n\nMoses would have known all about Egyptian gods. (Maybe there was an attic somewhere in his childhood too—a place where he feared seeing the spectre of the Anubis!) And Moses, like all children raised in Egypt, would have seen the Nile’s waters turning to blood as a blow struck specifically against the god of the Nile (Exodus 7:20). \n\nEach plague targeted one of the gods from the Egyptian pantheon and, one by one, Pharoah watched the pillars of his power turn to ash. This pattern fulfills a specific promise that God made through Moses to Israel and Pharaoh: \n\n“I will surely pass through all the land of Egypt and on every one of the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: for I am the Lord God over the whole of the earth” (Exodus 12:12).\n\nIn spite of this, Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he waffled about whether or not he should let Israel go. In his indecision he ignored this truth that Moses already knew: there is but one God, and He is God over all the earth (Exodus 10:8). He is present and sovereign throughout history, and He will not be mocked (Galatians 6:7). \n\nPharaoh never learned this lesson, but the Egyptian people did. Their awe of the one true God inspired them to press their gold and jewels into the hands of their Hebrew slaves departing for the Red Sea.\n\nWhen reading about the plagues, it’s easy to see them as an assault on the Egyptians and Pharaoh himself. While that’s partly true, the central point was to destroy the idolatry of the false gods. One by one, God chipped away at their false authority. The words, “Let my people go!” not only meant freedom from slavery, but freedom from idolatry.*\n\nWe don’t have to live in fear of supermen with jackal heads or fertile women with frog faces. There is only one God, and He is good. In His great goodness, He not only frees us from bondage, but He also unmasks the gods and powers of this world. History is filled with this resounding declaration: Every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (Romans 14:11).\n\n*George Grant. “The God’s of Egypt and the Exodus”, 2015.\n\n",

And now that promise was beginning to unfold. But freedom for the Israelites would come in a most unusual way—by faith in the blood of a Passover lamb.\n\nImagine how absurd those instructions detailed in Exodus 12 must have seemed to the Israelites who had been enslaved for 400 years. Slaves feasting together as a family? Dressing to travel? Preparing to leave in haste the cruel bondage of their Egyptian slave camp?\n\nEven the possibility of freedom would have seemed ludicrous. After generations of captivity, far more than the Israelites’ physical bodies were enslaved. Their souls had become shackled with hopelessness. \n\nBut as each plague unfolded, their lack of faith came face to face with the faithfulness of their covenant-keeping God—the One who had promised not only to bring them out of captivity, but to judge the nation that had oppressed them (Genesis 15:13-14). Judgment was falling upon Egypt because of their unbelief. \n\nBut wait. Weren’t the Israelites also guilty of unbelief?  Sure, they were the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But hadn’t they failed to believe that God would do what He’d promised to do?  \n\nYes, the Israelites deserved judgment, too (Exodus 6:9). And so do we. \n\nWe’ve all walked in unbelief. We’ve all gone our own way and are deserving of God’s judgment for our sin (Isaiah 53:6). And that judgment is always death (Romans 6:23). But in spite of our sin, God has never left us without hope!\n\n“The blood on the houses where you are staying will be a distinguishing mark for you; when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No plague will be among you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.”\n\n-Exodus 12:12-13\n\nThe Israelites were delivered from the judgment of God by faith in the blood of a Passover lamb (Hebrews 11:28). Judgment could not fall upon the household marked with blood, because it had already fallen on the lamb. \n\nBut despite their obedience, no animal sacrifice would ever truly be sufficient to cover the Israelites’ sin—or ours. “For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins” (Hebrews 10:4). Not until Calvary, when all the sins and all the sacrifices for all time were placed on Jesus, would our sin be put to death (1 Peter 3:18).   \n\nThanks be to God, our Deliverer has come! The judgment for our sin has fallen upon Christ. Now, when the Father looks on us He sees Jesus, whose blood covers all our sin and reconciles us to God, making us “holy, faultless, and blameless before Him” (1 Corinthians 5:7; Colossians 1:22). \n\nThe Lamb of God was slaughtered on our behalf. Surely He is worthy of our worship, our adoration, our praise—our everything (Revelation 5:12).\n\n“To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.”\n\n– Revelation 1:5-6\n\n",

Every once in a while, I was put on “zip line duty.” The zip line was at the very end of the ropes course. It was the fun part that came after climbing and wiggling and jumping and leaning on your partner through a somewhat rigorous series of obstacles, all beneath the hot Texas sun.\n\nThough the campers had tested their harnesses and carabineers to the extreme by the time they reached me at the zip line, they were often afraid to jump off the platform. It was my job to reassure them.\n\n“Don’t be afraid,” I’d say, “Look back there at that obstacle course you just did. Did you fall? Did your equipment fail you?”\n\n“No,” they’d whisper.\n\n“So why do you think it will this time?”\n\nThough I was confident on the zip line that summer, I am not always so confident in the face of scary things. I understand how easy it is to forget God’s steady hand and His faithfulness.\n\nI forget how He’s brought me safely through the obstacles behind me when I’m staring down the big, seemingly insurmountable one sitting right in front of me.\n\nWhen God parted the Red Sea in Exodus 14, His people had been through a series of events in which they witnessed God’s power and protection: plagues, the first Passover, and finally, delivery from Egypt. But then, just as they thought they were home free, Pharaoh’s army was chasing them.\n\nForgetting God’s power and protection in their past, they protested, “What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? … It would have been better for us to serve Egyptians than to die in the wilderness” (Exodus 14:11-12).\n\nBut Moses, who trusted in the God who had promised to deliver them, reassured the Israelites, “Don’t be afraid. Stand firm and see the Lord’s salvation will provide for you today” (Exodus 14:13).\n\nAnd the Lord did provide. He parted the water. He carved a path in dry land for His people to walk through. And once they were safely across, He crashed the waters back together, destroying Egypt’s entire army, bringing glory to His name by protecting His people. “When Israel saw the great power that the Lord used against the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord and believed in Him” (Exodus 14:31).\n\nOur lives are marked with similar Red Sea moments—times when God carried us through an obstacle we deemed insurmountable. Each time He does this, our faith is deepened and our view of God and His goodness and power is broadened.\n\nThese are the times we ought to remember when we’re standing on the platform, knees shaking, palms sweating. Like the Israelites with Egypt hot on their trail, we stare at the expanse of the valley before us, doubting how or even if God will bring us through this time.\n\nAt camp, almost every kid eventually attempted the zip line. After I reminded them about the strength of the cables and counted to three multiple times, down they went. The more they did it, the more they trusted, and the less afraid they were.\n\nIf you’re standing on a platform today, instead of focusing on the fear in front of you, look back and remember the path behind you. When has God parted the sea in your past? When has He made a way when there seemed to be no way?\n\nRemember, ours is a God “who works wonders” (Psalm 77:14). Even the sea obeys Him. Trust that the One who provided for you yesterday will provide for you today.\n\n",

The freckled brother and sister looked defeated, realizing their plan to convince me to let them sleep in the refrigerator doors had misfired.\n\nWe stood in the backyard with grass up to our ankles, my feet the only ones remaining still.\n\nThe girl’s pigtails twirled as she spread her arms and began spinning around and around in a circle. “Topsy turvy!” the boy squealed in delight, joining his sister until their knees buckled and hit the ground, their heads continuing to spin. They laughed at the dizzy, dark spots in their vision, and stood up to begin again. “You too!” they gestured.\n\nI obliged, joining in for the sake of the thank-goodness-we’re-over-the-refrigerator incident. My arms, double the span of theirs, flung wide as I twirled around, my ponytail flapping in the wind. My knees buckled, and I stared into the same dizzy, dark spots. But it wasn’t very fun, and I didn’t want to do it again. Although it had been years since I’d worn pigtails and found joy in my own topsy turvy-ing, the resulting feeling felt strangely familiar. It was disorienting, unknown and scary, much like the wilderness.\n\nI experience the same dizziness when I’m tossed by fear, pushed by doubt, and wrangled by sin, so I thrash for control. The Israelites did something similar, asking questions they hoped would domesticate the wild:\n\n“What are we to drink?” (Exodus 15: 24).\n\n“What is it?” (Exodus 16:15).\n\n“Why did you do this?” (Exodus 17:3).\n\n“Is the Lord among us or not?” (Exodus 17:7).\n\nWith no response in sight, they continued to spin aimlessly, dizzied spots masking their eyes.\n\nAs I sat in the grass watching the kids continue to twirl, I was reminded of a trick I’d learned in ballet as a little girl—spotting. In order to prevent dizziness, you choose a still object to fix your eyes on. With every turn of the pirouette, your head whips around to find your focal point, and you remain upright and dizzy-free. Reminded of this trick from childhood, I stood up, determined to try one more time. This time I glued my eyes to a nearby birdhouse as my body rotated again and again. It worked!\n\nMoses must have known this trick, too. While the Israelites continued to whirl in the wilderness, Moses kept His eyes fixed on one thing—God. With each unsettling turn of circumstances, Moses’ knees never buckled. God’s provision kept Moses standing firm by turning water from bitter to sweet (Exodus 15:25), raining manna from heaven (Exodus 16:4), and providing drinking water from the rock of Christ (Exodus 17:6).\n\nMoses’ determination was to remain upright in God’s promises, and he was used to fulfill the biggest one of them all—God’s holy promise to Abraham (Psalm 105:42). God established an entire nation of descendants through Moses!\n\nFriend, do you feel dizzied by the wilderness? Today, let’s try fixing our eyes on God’s presence. Let’s choose to trade the unsteady dark spots for the clarity of His faithfulness. May our spinning be steadied by His almighty hand. Amen.\n\nHere are the questions of the\n\nwilderness, “What!” “Where!”\n\n“How?” Faith has a brief but\n\ncomprehensive answer to all\n\nthe three, namely, God!\n\n–Charles Henry Mackintosh\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Vivian Mabuni\n\nText: Exodus 17:8-16, Exodus 18:1-27, Proverbs 19:20\n\nLife as a young mom had left me exhausted and exasperated. My hair was forever in a ponytail, and I rarely snagged a shower. Variations of snot, food, and crusted drool had taken up residence on the sleeves and shoulders of my shirts. The hope of ever again going to the bathroom in peace—alone and with the door closed—had become a distant memory.\n\nI was in the throes of a whole new world, just trying to keep the littles alive and fed. And I was struggling to connect with God. The loss of that connection gnawed away at me, and left me with a deep sense of guilt. The days of long, uninterrupted Bible study and prayer now seemed long gone, and I missed them. \n\nMy friend Prisca has three grown sons, and her youngest was once part of our on-campus college ministry. He was mentored by my husband throughout his college years, and so we got to know him well, witnessing firsthand how he lived out his faith—grounded, humble, secure, and wildly generous.\n\nI grew to admire and appreciate the role his parents played in raising him, and in particular his mom. I can clearly remember one of our first meals together in their home. Prisca listened with warmth and understanding as my tears rolled down and words tumbled out. I shared both the struggles and joys of new motherhood, and confessed my shame in not feeling connected to God during such a challenging season of life.\n\nJethro knew Moses was in a difficult season. He knew well the call God had on Moses’ life and how his son-in-law’s heart longed to serve God and minister to His people. But he could also see the unsustainability of how Moses was going about his life. He took the time to listen to Moses and observe his situation, before offering wise counsel (Exodus 18:13-16).\n\n“‘What you’re doing is not good,’ Moses’ father-in-law said to him. ‘You will certainly wear out both yourself and these people who are with you, because the task is too heavy for you. You can’t do it alone.’”\n\n-Exodus 18:17-18\n\nI fully expected Prisca, an amazingly godly woman, to admonish me about the importance of God’s Word and how I needed to rise earlier and work harder to protect my time with God. But instead, Prisca touched my arm and with a joyful laugh, shared, “You know, these are busy, challenging years you’re in, but it won’t always be like this. I remember going grocery shopping by myself once, when I was where you are. I just stopped and stared at the oranges for a long, long time…”\n\nPrisca’s words were like a sweet balm seeping into the deeper parts of my soul, bringing relief and, honestly, surprise. Her words of grace met my depleted body and soul exactly where I needed them. They encouraged me to stop striving and rest in order to keep from burning out. To stop trying to do it all on my own. She assured me that in my surrender, God would show me new ways of connecting with Him.\n\nWe all need a Jethro in our lives. We need someone who will patiently build our trust by observing and listening without judgment. We need people to seek out our hearts, instead of quickly offering unsolicited advice. And should we be blessed with such a friend, may we learn from their wisdom and heed their advice.\n\n“Listen to advice and accept instruction, that you may gain wisdom in the future.”\n\n-Proverbs 19:20\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Exodus 19:1-25, Exodus 20:1-21, John 1:14-18\n\nNo whining.\n\nPass with care.\n\nNo shirt, no shoes, no service.\n\nIf mama ain’t happy, ain’t nobody happy.\n\nFrom the moment we were old enough to scoot across the floor, a list of rules has governed our lives. We have dress codes and curfews and traffic laws. We wait our turn in line at the coffee shop and always wear our seat belts.\n\nIf we sat down and started talking, I bet we could go on for hours listing rules that guide every bit of how we go about our days.\n\nBut when God gave the Law, He didn’t give 10,000 commandments. He gave only ten.\n\nWhy only ten? Why these ten? In light of grace and freedom in the New Testament, what place does the Old Testament law have in our lives today?\n\nAlmost as if he knew we would be asking these questions, John Calvin wrote what would later be known as the “Threefold Use of the Law,” in order to show the importance of the Ten Commandments in the Christian life.\n\n#1: The Law acts as a mirror, reflecting the perfect righteousness of God and in contrast, the reality of human sinfulness. \n\nIf we are honest, it doesn’t take 1,000 laws to reveal our sin nature. We may be able to keep a commandment or two for the span of the day, but none of us can keep them all. Even stopping at ten, the Law effectively illuminates my utter sinfulness.\n\n#2: The Law’s second job is to restrain evil. The Law can’t change our hearts (which is why we are willing to speed until we see red and blue lights in the rearview mirror). Even so, the law can inhibit lawlessness and protect the righteous from the unjust.\n\n#3: The Law gives us a revelation of what is pleasing to God. The Law serves as a guide to good works for believers.\n\nWhen we look at the ten specific commandments God handed down to Moses, we see that He covered all of the bases. Laws 1 through 4 address the relationship between God and man. Laws 5 through 10 address how people relate to each other. When you get down to it, every nook and cranny of our sin can fall into one of these ten categories. Willing to compromise for your dream job? Check out commandment number two. Jealous of your neighbor’s house? That violates number ten. See what I mean?\n\nThe purpose of the Law is not to create an impossible checklist, but rather to show us what matters to God while also making our need for Him clear. \n\nFriends, the Law is good news because it undergirds the message of justice and extravagant mercy Christ came to give. Thanks be to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Moses and the Golden Calf",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nText: Exodus 32:1-35, Malachi 4:1-6\n\nHave you ever come to a crossroads in life and earnestly sought the voice of God—only to eventually give up on hearing from Him and take your best guess at which direction to go?\n\nTake it from me: it’s not a great strategy. I’ve jumped into jobs, relationships, and commitments of all kinds when God might’ve been calling me elsewhere. It’s caused pain for others and myself.\n\nYou could say I’m not a patient person, but I think the root of the problem goes even deeper than that. I’ve jumped into jobs rather than waiting on the Lord because I’ve idolized work as a source of purpose and security. I’ve jumped into relationships because I’ve idolized people as a source of comfort and love. I’ve made all sorts of decisions apart from God because I’ve idolized myself, believing I’m fit to rule my own life.\n\nJust like the Israelites, we make idols because we lack faith in God. Our fallen hearts doubt He is good, mighty, and always present with us. Believing He is absent, we are all too happy to place ourselves upon the throne that belongs to God alone.\n\nIn Exodus 32, we see the Israelites do just that. When Moses was slow to come back down from the mountain, they quickly lost their faith. They believed that if Moses was absent, then God must be, too.\n\nKeep in mind, God had just rescued the Israelites from enslavement in Egypt. They’d watched Him send plague after plague to free them (Exodus 7-11), and pillars of cloud and fire to lead them in the wilderness (Exodus 13:21). He’d parted the Red Sea, giving them dry ground to flee from their enemy (Exodus 14:15-31). He’d even provided manna from heaven to nourish them, and drinking water from a rock to refresh them (Exodus 16; 17:1-7).\n\nAfter seeing God work so powerfully on their behalf, it’s hard to believe the Israelites’ hearts were so easily turned that they would worship a golden calf. It’s easy to judge them for their lack of faith. But the Israelites’ story should lead us to examine our own hearts.\n\nHave you ever seen God work a miracle, whether big or small, in your life or in the lives of those you love? Mountaintop miracles renew our fervor for the Lord, making it easier for us to praise Him. But what happens when, a month or two later, we find ourselves in a valley, feeling very far away from the miracles on the mountain? In those moments of desperation, do we turn to God for comfort and guidance, or do we assume He is absent? Do we doubt His goodness, like the Israelites did, and turn to something or someone else entirely?\n\nIdols don’t always present themselves in the form of a golden calf. In truth, we can make an idol out of anything—even relatively innocent things, like wise counsel from a friend. Or practicing spiritual disciplines like prayer and fasting, which can become idols if we begin to obsess over them instead seeking and worshiping the Lord. God has given us good desires for relationships, work, discipline, and beauty—but these desires are meant to point us toward God and the eternal life to come, not be an end in themselves.\n\nGod is jealous for our undivided and devoted worship (Exodus 34:14), and He knows that worshiping anything other than Him will only lead to heartbreak. He alone can satisfy the desires of our hearts. By His grace, may our hearts learn to solely direct our worship to the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Exodus 33:1-23, John 1:14, Matthew 17:1-5\n\nDo you ever wonder what people think when they meet you? When I leave a conversation, does everybody quietly give me a slow clap and gratefully nod their heads? Or do they all sigh with relief and laugh, relieved that the crazy lady has moved on?\n\nWhat do people see when they see me? They might notice my grouchy exhaustion and my giant orange sweater (again). But what I want others to see is my loving attention, my interested eyes, and my empathy for them.\n\nI’ve often thought of what it looks like to be a Christian. It’s not being nice at the grocery store or letting other drivers cut me off graciously—it’s not those little things. It’s one big thing: we look like Christians because of the presence and glory of God. How can that be? What exactly is the presence and glory of God?\n\nConsider our prayers inviting God’s presence to meet us in worship: God’s presence isn’t simply a warm and euphoric feeling. In the Bible we read that the presence of God came with claps of thunder (Job 37:4, 2 Samuel 22:14) and made people cry out in fear (Jeremiah 5:22;  Job 23:13-16). Even the fading marks of God’s presence shining on Moses’ face prompted the Israelites to tremble and plead with Moses to cover up the awesome and terrifying glow of God’s presence (Exodus 34:29-35). In the Bible, it seems that everyone who encounters the presence of God or His angels hits the deck with fear.\n\nBut instead of demanding that we cower from His holy presence, God mysteriously invites us to not be afraid. God invites us to come close (Genesis 26:24; Luke 1:20). The glory of God changes us.\n\nSo what does the mark of God’s presence with us look like?\n\nA Life led by the Spirit. Moses and Israel actually looked to a pillar of flame to follow God. Without flame in the sky, we still have His never-ending promises.\n\nA Spirit of Humility: God calls us to follow where He leads, even if He leads us into the wilderness. Seek Him. Honor Him. He can be trusted.\n\nIdentity in Him: He knows us by name, just as He knew Moses by name. He defines who we are. Our confidence comes from Christ alone.\n\nA Spirit of Security: Just as Moses was hidden in the cleft of the rock, God shields us from a glory that would kill us if we saw it without filter. God shows compassion on us in our weakness, and keeps us safe. We don’t have to live in fear.\n\nA Spirit of Worship: The presence of God invites us to proclaim the name of Yahweh. We direct our adoration to Him. He alone deserves our worship.\n\nDelight in Christ: When Jesus was baptized, the Father called Him beloved Son. He takes delight in Christ. God’s presence invites us to delight in Christ also. The mark of God’s presence is love of Christ.\n\nWithout His presence, we have none of these things; we cannot manufacture them. To venture forth in anything without the blessings of God is fearfully futile, because His gracious favor is our only security.\n\nMay the God who “became flesh and took up residence among us” shine His light on our faces (John 1:14). May we reflect His goodness and mercy. When people look at us, may they see the glow of God’s glory.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ali Claxton\n\nText: Exodus 34:1-35, Exodus 40:34-38, 2 Corinthians 3:7-18  \n\nIt was late afternoon as I boarded the non-stop flight back to Nashville, anxious to get home after a week in unfamiliar territory.\n\nThe plane settled into a rhythm, and I leaned my head back and glanced out the window. In an instant, I was captivated. We were flying above what looked like an ocean of clouds. Colors of the sunset sprayed one side of the world in a hundred shades of pink and orange. It was so mesmerizing I could barely blink. I wanted to see more. I wanted to stretch the window wide so I could experience the fullness of the sky’s beauty. It was too vast for me to capture from my limited viewpoint.\n\nAs I sat back and closed my eyes, vibrant colors remained etched in my mind. I was in awe of the wonder and glory of God. But as wondrous as these images and experiences may be, they are only glimpses of Him, evidence of His infinite greatness, which is far too big for us to fully comprehend (Isaiah 55:9).\n\nI can’t begin to imagine how Moses felt as the glory of God radiated from a cloud above the mountain where he stood. Beckoned by the Lord Himself, Israel’s leader obediently approached with nothing but blank tablets in his hands—new tablets to replace ones shattered in the wake of Israel’s idolatry (Exodus 34:1-3; 32:19). God, in an overwhelming display of mercy, offered them a clean slate (Exodus 32:33). He remained faithful to His covenant and led His people to the land of promise, by His glory and grace.\n\nAs the weight of pure holiness hovered above Moses, God declared the power of His name. Scripture tells us, “Moses immediately bowed down to the ground and worshiped” (Exodus 34:8). He lingered there in God’s presence for 40 days.\n\nLike the moon reflecting the brilliance of the sun, Moses’ face soaked up the radiance of God’s light until a visible glow permeated his countenance. He’d seen only a glimpse of God’s glory, but descended that mountain more certain than ever of Yahweh’s flawless character and covenant love.\n\nFrom a mountain to a sacred tent, God’s glory remained near as the Israelites wandered in the wilderness. Time and time again, Moses approached the Lord as Israel’s advocate then stood before a trembling nation as God’s mouthpiece. Moses led the people faithfully, but he was powerless to save them. He spoke to God on their behalf, but he could never close the gap that separated them from God’s presence. While Moses played an integral role in redemptive history, the story was always bigger than him (Hebrews 3:3).\n\nWe know the rest of the story.\n\nIn Christ, the glory of God came down and dwelt among us (John 1:14). The veil that once darkened our eyes was torn away by the power of redemption (Hebrews 10:19-22). Jesus is the greater Advocate, the One who stood in our place and offered Himself as our substitute. Wrapped in eternal light, He now stands before the Father on our behalf and covers us with the radiance of His righteousness.\n\n“The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of His nature, sustaining all things by His powerful word. After making purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.”\n\n-Hebrews 1:3\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Moses and the Bronze Serpent",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: Numbers 21:4-9, John 3:1-21\n\nWhen we know what to look for, we can find Bible teachers everywhere.\n\nFor example, the next time you see an ambulance, look for the blue symbol of a snake wrapped around a pole. Perhaps, like many of us, snakes (and ambulances) give you the heebie jeebies and your eyes naturally want to look away. But pay attention, friend. That obscure little symbol is preaching the gospel.\n\nSmack dab in the middle of the Exodus epic, we find a strange little story. As the Israelites moved from Egypt toward the Promised Land, they developed a chronic grumbling problem. Despite repeated warnings and punishment for complaining against God and Moses (Numbers 11:1, 14:2), God’s people continued to bellyache. God’s judgment for this sin is found in Numbers 21:6:\n\n“Then the Lord sent poisonous snakes among the people, and they bit them so that many Israelites died.”\n\nThe fact that God takes sin so seriously makes me squirm like a snake myself. When I see that He won’t skip judgment for those offenses I’d call “inconsequential”—like grumbling—I squirm even more. But God’s judgment and mercy are inseparable. When you see judgment in His Word, or feel it in your own life, look deeper. Once flipped over, we see that God’s infinite mercy is on the other side of that coin.\n\n“Then the Lord said to Moses, ‘Make a snake image and mount it on a pole. When anyone who is bitten looks at it, he will recover.’ So Moses made a bronze snake and mounted it on a pole. Whenever someone was bitten, and he looked at the bronze snake, he recovered.’”\n\n-Numbers 21:8-9\n\nGod delivered judgment, but then He delivered mercy. This wasn’t back-peddling or flip-flopping. It was His divine nature on full display. Because He is holy, He must deal with our sin. Because He is love, He chooses to offer us mercy. \n\nWhen the grumbling Israelites looked to the bronze serpent held high on a pole, they were saved from the punishment they deserved. Mercifully, God used the emblem of His judgment to draw His people back to Himself. That’s good news for them that points to even better news for us.\n\n“Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in Him will have eternal life.”\n\n-John 3:14-15\n\nDon’t miss this—it’s too wonderful!\n\nThe Israelites looked to a snake on a pole for healing from poisonous venom.\n\nWe look to the Savior on the cross to heal us from the poison of sin.\n\nThey were given an injunction against immediate physical death.\n\nWe’re saved from spiritual death, and granted eternal life instead.  \n\nI doubt the Israelites wanted to fix their eyes on a bronze snake while actual snakes were striking at their heels. But God needed them to look hard at His judgment so they could receive His mercy.\n\nLike the snake-bitten Israelites, we’re sinners deserving of God’s judgment. It’s tempting to look away from that truth. But, look! His mercy is easy to spot. God uses the cross, the emblem of His judgment, to draw us back to Himself.\n\nBecause of our sin, the cross was necessary. That’s judgment. Yet, from the cross, Jesus took the punishment we deserve, and in His mercy, He overcame the Snake and death once and for all (Hebrews 2:14). What mercy!\n\nLook past God’s servant Moses, and see the God who delivers both righteous judgment and loving mercy. Look past the snake on the pole and see the Savior on the cross.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Deuteronomy 32:48-52, Deuteronomy 33:1-29, Deuteronomy 34:1-12\n\nDriving in the van, we talked about prosaic adult things in the front, while the children rattled around in the back. I was telling my husband about a memory-building chart I’d seen in college, and they were playing “touched you last.” But later that morning, sitting next to my journal-obsessed nine-year-old, I looked over and saw a transcript of our conversation and a rendering of the chart I’d described.\n\nSimultaneously surprised, delighted, and a little alarmed, I remembered how important we are to her. Right now, she is interested in everything we say and do. Objects, places, and ideas all hold special significance for my daughter if she hears that I love them.\n\nIt’s a weighty thing to be so adored by someone, to be so intimately and lovingly observed. God invited Moses into intimacy. When Moses was born, “he was beautiful in God’s sight” (Acts 7:20). God knew and watched Moses from the beginning, and He called Moses into a close and special journey with Him. Unlike my daughter, God wasn’t simply eavesdropping on Moses; He was giving Moses the unimaginable gift of His loving attention.\n\nGod’s attention seems so unfathomable to me. Why would the Almighty bother to attend to my nail-biting hesitations, or even my wedding day? His is a love so big, we cannot even fathom it.\n\nGod loves His people so much that He actually invites us into a relationship with Him. There are few places in history where we have such a beautiful record of God’s tender and patient encounters with men. From the day of his birth, Moses enjoyed God’s special favor and blessing, and this close relationship between God and Moses continued to Moses’ final day.\n\nBecause of his sin at the waters of Meribah, Moses was not allowed to enter the Promised Land (Numbers 20:11). But even in the midst of this heartbreaking judgment, God showed favor to Moses and allowed him a glimpse of His promised home for Israel.\n\nGod’s favor doesn’t look like what we’d expect it to. The blessing of God isn’t limited by our ideas of good living. When I pray for His blessing and favor, in my heart, I’m often just asking for things to go my way. But the glory of God’s blessing is not circumstantial at all—the blessing is intimacy with God Himself.\n\nMoses’ life was a whirlwind of disappointments and triumphs, but regardless of what was going on in the tents and on the desert plain, God was with him. The final scene of Moses’ life is private and tender: God buries him in a secret place. He was God’s man.\n\nMay we long for this kind of intimacy with God. May “He who spoke to Moses” be our ever-present help in trouble, the shield that protects us. For “indeed He loves His people” (Deuteronomy 33:3), and he is our dwelling place, let us desire nothing more than to draw near to Him and see His face (Deuteronomy 33:27).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: Matthew 27:57-66, Matthew 28:1-15\n\nMy husband is deathly afraid of heights. \n\nHis fear only emerges every now and then. At the lake, for instance, when invited to go cliff-jumping with friends, and he declines. Or after finally reaching the summit of a long hike, when I step forward to peer over the edge, and he takes a giant step back. His fear isn’t debilitating—it’s just always there, lingering. So I didn’t anticipate his reaction when I booked our “doors off” helicopter tour over Hawaii. \n\nThere we were, safety floatation devices secured, boarding the Hughes 500, which felt more like a toy car than a helicopter. As the propeller sliced through the air and we lifted off, I could barely contain my thrill. My husband, on the other hand, could barely contain his breakfast.\n\nFear hits us all, sometimes when we least expect it, and sometimes in the exact same place,  over and over again—no matter how many times the pilot tells us we’re safe. \n\nIn the days after Jesus’ crucifixion, we see how several different groups of people reacted to fear. Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Christ, courageously asked Pilate for Jesus’ body, then wrapped it in linen, and placed it in a tomb he’d previously bought for himself. Jesus’ friends, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, resolved to sit and wait and watch the tomb where Jesus was laid.\n\nMeanwhile, paranoia had overcome the chief of priests and Pharisees. Together, they convinced Pilate to send guards to the tomb—just in case the story wasn’t over. They feared Jesus’ disciples would steal His body and proclaim His resurrection (Matthew 27:57-66).\n\nA crew of centurions was sent to keep watch over the sealed tomb—a boring assignment; mundane work. Standing. Waiting. Guarding the grave of a dead man. What do they think is going to happen here?, they must have thought.  \n\nBut then, the earth shook. Rocks crumbled. The stone covering the grave rolled back, and an angel of the Lord appeared, his clothes white as lightning. “The guards were so afraid… they shook and became like dead men” (Matthew 28:1-4).\n\nWhat were they so afraid of?\n\nMaybe they were afraid of the earthquake, and afraid of the stranger strong enough to roll away the stone. Maybe they were afraid of being killed for treason, having lost the body of Jesus, an enemy of the state (Matthew 28:11-15). Maybe it was all of the above. \n\nThe centurions were afraid of dying, when the cure for death had been resurrected right in front of them.\n\nMary and Mary Magdalene encountered this same angel of the Lord. Trembling, they listened as an angel proclaimed that Jesus had defeated death, just as He said He would. He was risen! The story wasn’t over! What did they feel when they heard the news? \n\n“So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy…”\n\n-Matthew 28:8\n\nAfraid yet filled with joy. I love those words! \n\nIf you are afraid of who God might be, you’re not alone. The story of Jesus’ gruesome death and quaking resurrection should shake us to our core, just as it did the guards at the tomb. But believers have this distinct and extraordinary gift: our fear lives side by side with our joy. He is who He said He is—the very Son of God. What a fearsome, wonderful thought! \n\nOn the day of our helicopter ride, my husband was so nervous he couldn’t even look out onto the island thousands of feet below. But as we rode over the mountains and the Pacific Ocean, he saw me—smiling and pointing, unable to contain my enthusiasm—and he could look. Still afraid, yet filled with joy.\n\nThank you, Jesus, that Your glory is greater than our fear. When the world cowers in fear or tries to explain You away, give us courage to hold out the gospel. For You have defeated death itself. You alone are our joy. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Encounters with Christ: Mary Magdalene & The Disciples",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sarah Matheny\n\nText: John 20:11-23\n\nNo one will ever accuse me of needlessly holding onto things. I consider myself organized, if not clutter-loathing. An older relative of mine, on the other hand, lands far on the other end of the spectrum. She just so happens to currently have seven cars parked in her driveway. And though I get frustrated having to play automobile Tetris each time I go to her house for dinner, her reasoning for possessing these cars is actually quite sweet—they belonged to her loved ones.\n\nAmong the vehicles are her father’s Cadillac, her mother’s Honda, and the barely-driveable GMC minivan that her now-grown children practically lived in for most of their middle-school and high-school sports careers. I’ve tried multiple times to convince her to donate these cars to a charitable organization, but she just can’t bear to let go. She wants to hold on.\n\nThis sentiment of holding on to the past is one most of us can, at least somewhat, relate to. But it is even more exaggerated and understandable when we see Mary experiencing the risen Christ for the first time. When Mary finally realizes that the man talking to her outside the tomb is not the gardener but Jesus Himself, she addresses Him as “Rabboni,” meaning “my great teacher.” She sees Him as the person He was to her in His time on Earth, the man in the flesh, not what He is now—her Lord and Savior.\n\nOf course she would want to hold on to Him! He was the man who had quite literally set her free from the hold of demons. He had been her friend and her mentor. The last time Mary had laid eyes on Jesus, He had been brutally murdered—crucified—and she’d been weeping over the loss of Him for the past three days.\n\nBut Jesus wanted more for Mary than for her to cling to the past. He wants more for us, too. He had returned to give an assignment and to make a promise.\n\n“Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”\n\n-John 20:17\n\nJesus gives a similar commission when He appears to His disciples, who are locked in a meeting room upstairs. He greets them with peace but does not linger. Instead, He promises that His very presence will be with them now and into eternity. With a first-hand account of His resurrection and Jesus’ guarantee of help from His Holy Spirit, the disciples are sent off to do the work of setting others free with the message of the gospel (Matthew 28:19-20).\n\nJesus calls us, as the Church, to that same beautiful work. Are we sharing the good news of His life, death, and resurrection? Are we parking it away in our hearts, or are we passing it on? What keeps us from sharing the gospel with those who need its truth just as desperately as we do?\n\nIf the sound of Christ’s commissioning words in John 20:21, “I am sending you,” causes a lump of fear, or pride, or disbelief to rise in your throat, remember this: when we take the gospel to others, just like those first disciples, we are not sent out alone. We bring with us His Word, planted in our hearts (Psalm 119:11). We bring with us the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:11), Who grows good fruit in us (Galatians 5:22-23). We bring the security of knowing our home is not here, but in eternity with God (Philippians 3:20).\n\nThis holy work—done in fellowship with the very Spirit of the risen Christ—is an immeasurable gift, worth more than anything else we cling to. We have been invited to tell a lost and aching world the truth of the resurrected Jesus. We’ve been asked to tell others Who He is and how fully He loves us. By God’s grace, may we do that today and every day—right here, and to the ends of the earth.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Encounters with Christ: On The Road to Emmaus",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Luke 24:13-35\n\nChrist’s walk with the disciples on the road to Emmaus is legendary. For years, I’ve watched people’s eyes glaze over as they sigh, “If only we could have heard that conversation! What I would give to hear Jesus explain the whole of Scripture!” It does feel like the golden ticket: the interpretation of Christ’s place in Scripture, beginning with Moses and the prophets, given by Christ Himself.\n\nBut even if the conversation were recorded and we had one more chapter there in Luke, detailing the truth in red letters, shining brightly in every Bible—would it make a difference? Would it make the Bible a better, more complete account? Would it finally give us the missing piece to complete our greater understanding of Scripture and godliness?\n\nAbsolutely not. Scripture is complete (Revelation 22:18-19). It’s also filled with interpretations, prophecies, and explanations of Christ’s place in God’s plan of redemption, from Genesis to Revelation. But this encounter with Christ on the road to Emmaus does feel special somehow.\n\nIt’s as if we can hear the disciples imploring, “Stay with us!” We can see Christ allowing them to savor those extraordinary moments with Him, their hearts “ablaze” from the truth and love shared in that rare, sweet conversation (John 24:29, 32).\n\nScripture is not a secret code. It is a revelation, shining light on everything under the sun. Yes, there is a rich mystery and paradox in a Creator who would send His own Son to die for His creation. But the gospel itself is not a secret. The gospel is simple:\n\n“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.”\n\n-John 3:16\n\nThere’s really only one story: the knight slays the dragon and rescues the princess (Isaiah 25:8). The gospel is in all of our stories. \n\nBut we don’t have to see it if we don’t want to. We can delude ourselves into believing that the gospel is too complicated to understand. Nevertheless, Christ brings light and truth (John 8:12). On the road to Emmaus, “He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,” and He has sent His Holy Spirit to do the same for us now (Luke 24:45; John 14:26).\n\nAmazingly, the longing we feel when reading about the Emmaus encounter is fulfilled in the Holy Spirit. Like those disciples, our hearts implore, “Stay with us!” and Christ answers, “Lo, I am with you always” (Matthew 28:20). He is indeed with us, and He continues to set our hearts ablaze by His abiding Spirit.\n\nWe, too, are called to be people of the Word and to walk by the Spirit. We can go forth in His freedom and light! We can know our Bibles and see that God’s redemptive hand has been at work for our good from the Old Testament through the New Testament, and even still today. We are rescued by His love and transformed by His redemption. The truth of the gospel is laid plain for us in Scripture, and Christ is with us! Thanks be to God.\n\n“Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. . . No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.”\n\n-Deuteronomy 30:11,14\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Encounters with Christ: Thomas",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: John 20:24-31\n\nThere was a period in my life when I identified with Thomas’ doubts. I read his story and was uncertain about the basics of my own faith. I questioned what I believed. Was Jesus who He said He was, and did He really rise from the grave? Has His resurrection truly brought me my salvation? Like Thomas, I wanted to see Him in the flesh and lay my hand on His scars.\n\nIt was a hard but good place to be. Wrestling with doubt and being honest about our questions can bring us to a deeper faith in a powerful way. \n\nThese days, I don’t spend as much time struggling with this type of doubt. By His grace, the Lord has somehow brought me to a more secure place, and I’m grateful that I no longer doubt as I used to. But as I read this story in John again, I realize it’s not that my doubting days are over, it’s just that my doubting looks different now.\n\nI think we’re all “Doubting Thomases” in our own way. Maybe I don’t doubt my faith as much as I once did, but I doubt other things. Take God’s character, for instance. I’ve sometimes wondered, Is He really good? Does He care for me? He was faithful those other times, but will He be faithful this time?\n\nSome days, I doubt the cross and its effectiveness in my life. I get stuck on questions like, Did Jesus really save me? Does His sacrifice still count, even when I continue to commit this same sin again and again?\n\nI doubt Christ’s steadfast love and the permanence of His forgiveness. Surely He’ll give up on me this time. Surely I’m no longer worthy to be called God’s child. Surely grace is for everyone else, but not for me.\n\nNo matter where we are in our faith/doubt journey, we all struggle with unbelief. That’s what makes Thomas’ story so encouraging. Although we doubt and question and are fearful in different ways, the answer—the proof we need—is the same for us as it was for Thomas. It’s found in Jesus’ words:\n\n“Put your finger here and observe My hands. Reach out your hand and put it into My side. Don’t be an unbeliever, but a believer.”\n\n-John 20:27\n\nI think it’s incredible that we serve a God who doesn’t shun us in our doubts but actually moves toward us in the midst of them, offering us the proof we’re asking for. In the midst of our unbelief, Jesus tells us to look to Him in order to believe again.\n\nWhat do you need to believe in today?\n\nIs it the basics of your faith? Look at the resurrection.\n\nObserve the scars on His hands and put your hand into His side.\n\nIs it God’s goodness? Look at God’s Son whom He sent to save us.\n\nObserve the scars on His hands and put your hand into His side.\n\nIs it His grace? Look at the cross.\n\nObserve the scars on His hands and put your hand into His side.\n\nJesus’ scars are not only our proof—they are our hope for every doubt. They are the Truth that casts out every fear and lie.\n\nJesus comes to us just as He came to Thomas in that room with the disciples. He invites us to see and believe for ourselves, so that we may trust in the resurrection and what it means for us—and what it will mean for us, every day of our lives and after.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Encounters with Christ: Peter’s Reinstatement",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebekah Lyons\n\nText: John 21:1-25\n\nAs darkness settled, Peter decided to go fishing.\n\nMaybe he thought it was the only thing left that he could control. Jesus, whom he loved, had died and risen again. He was overjoyed in knowing his beloved teacher and friend was alive, but guilt-ridden after denying Him (John 18:15-27). His shame had led him here, to familiar waters. With a few trusted friends by his side, Peter pushed off from the shore.\n\nVenturing out into the night, I imagine he looked for solace in the stars. Perhaps he hoped his old everyday routine would bring comfort. He cast his nets far to the left of the boat, but it was a no-go—the expert fisherman couldn’t catch a thing all night (John 21:3-4).\n\nAs the sun rose, they drifted toward the beach and looked up to find the Son of God standing on the shore, though they didn’t recognize Him.\n\n“‘Men,’ Jesus called to them, ‘you don’t have any fish, do you?’\n\n‘No,’ they answered.\n\n‘Cast the net on the right side of the boat,’ He told them, ‘and you’ll find some.’ So they did, and they were unable to haul it in because of the large number of fish. Therefore the disciple, the one Jesus loved, said to Peter, ‘It is the Lord!’” (John 21:5-7).\n\nRight then and there, Peter jumped into the water and swam to shore. Despite the angst in his own heart, he couldn’t help but be drawn to another encounter with his Savior and friend. However, there was still unfinished business between them. Before sending him out into the world to help rescue the souls of unbelievers, Jesus would gently restore Peter to Himself (Matthew 18:16-20).\n\nJesus had a feast waiting for them upon the shore—breakfast a la cookout, I like to call it—a hearty portion of grilled fish and bread, prepared for everyone (John 21:12-13). After they ate their fill, Jesus and Peter stole some moments alone. Jesus had come to do for Peter what He longs to do for each of us: He had come to remove Peter’s shame.\n\nAnd so for each of the three times Peter denied Him, Jesus asked:\n\nDo you love me?\n\nYes, Lord.\n\nFeed my lambs.\n\nDo you love me?\n\nYou know I love You.\n\nShepherd my sheep.\n\nDo you love me?\n\nYou know everything. You know that I love you.\n\nFeed my sheep.\n\n(John 21:15-17, my paraphrase)\n\nWhat I love most about this exchange is Jesus’ immediate grace toward Peter after the resurrection. Jesus knew Peter would likely carry the shame and guilt of his denial for the rest of his life, unless He intervened. The point of the cross, after all, was that guilt and sin would no longer hold us captive.\n\nThe resurrection power of Jesus sought Peter out, reminding him of everything they’d ever known in their friendship. First, Jesus once again confirmed His love for Peter, and allowed Peter to express his love in return. Then, He gave Peter instruction on how to further this message of love, the gospel. Despite Peter’s denial, his place in the Kingdom never changed. Jesus’ plan and purpose for him remained the same.\n\nWhen I think of all the ways I’ve blown it, the innumerable ways my actions should’ve thwarted God’s plan and call upon my life, I’m exceedingly humbled. In spite of our shortcomings, God promises to complete His good work in each of us (Philippians 1:6). His power and His love for us are far greater than our sin and shame.\n\nThis is the good news! This is the gospel.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Luke 24:36-53, John 16:4-33, Hebrews 10:11-14\n\nAs a kid growing up in Michigan—all blonde braids and denim overalls—I was sure that heaven must be a wonderful place, and equally certain that I was bound to see all the animals I loved there. I was less sure how I felt about worshipping and bowing around a big throne for all of eternity. And I was skeptical about angels and beasts saying, “Holy, holy, holy” (Revelation 4:8). Why so repetitive, anyway? And when would we get to eat clove-flavored gumdrops and jump on clouds?\n\nThe world has a lot to say about heaven, but much like my childhood vision, it’s often far more informed by wistful thinking than by Scripture. But wherever and whatever heaven is, we do know this to be true: when Christ left His disciples, He ascended to heaven (Luke 24:51), and “after offering one sacrifice for sins forever,” He “sat down at the right hand of God” (Hebrews 10:12). \n\nGod is in heaven, and Jesus sits at His right hand.\n\nI love having firm answers to biblical questions. Because honestly, my kids ask me stuff like this all the time, and I want to be a good and accurate teacher for them. The concept of Christ ascended to heaven could make us feel like Christ has disappeared from earth, but His ascension to His place at God’s right hand actually changes everything.\n\nThe Bible tells us that God the Father is Spirit, and He does not have a body like we do (John 4:24; Colossians 1:15). Jesus, on the other hand, does have a body, and He ascended in that body to His Father in heaven (Luke 24:39). Scripture also gives a glimpse, however limited, of the future awaiting us when our own bodies are raised even as Jesus was (I Corinthians 15:52; Romans 6:4). \n\nWe don’t know all the details of what heaven looks like, or how it will feel to be in the presence of God (though I reckon it’s going to be good!). We do, however, know that Christ is seated, signifying that His work is complete, and this changes not only our future, but the here and now. \n\nWhy? Because only by His ascension do we receive His Spirit (John 16:7). And our ascended Christ is, even now, interceding for us at the throne of God (1 Timothy 2:5; Romans 8:34). Jesus, right this instant, is serving as our High Priest! He has gone on to heaven to prepare a place for us (John 14:2), and He’s guaranteed to return for us, when He will judge both the living and the dead (John 14:3; 1 Peter 4:5).\n\nWhat difference does this knowledge make to us now? It turns our sorrows into joy (John 16:20)! \n\nBecause Christ’s work is complete, our salvation is secure. His ascension and enthronement mean that our hope is sure, and we can have confidence as we approach the throne of grace, and joy as we serve Him here (Ephesians 3:12).\n\nHeaven will be beyond our wildest dreams. I don’t know if there will be old dogs, or gumdrops, or cloud-jumping—though I wouldn’t put any of that past our God in His never-ending goodness to His children. Nevertheless, what great comfort it is to know that the Christ who died for us has ascended to heaven and waits for us there. We can be confident, not only of the good things to come, but of His loving, mediating work on our behalf this very day. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Our Eternal Transformation: Who Are We Now?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: 1 Corinthians 15:1-11, Romans 6:1-11\n\nThe idea of summer camp has always been idyllic, adorable, and… decidedly not for me. This is probably due to the fact that the mere suggestion of talking before 10am deeply offends me. A morning person I am not.\n\nThe one time I allowed myself to be sucked into the bizarre vortex of sleep-away camp, a chipper name-tagged counselor welcomed me by shoving my bags onto a mothballed bunk bed and explaining that, for him, the best part of camp was all the cheers.\n\nAwesome!\n\nOf course I was fully prepared to fake a pom-pom allergy. But oh-what-bliss to learn that fate aligned those cheering sessions for ALL campers with the rising of the sun each and every morning. And here I was, thinking I would avoid sunrise altogether as per usual. No such luck.\n\nSomehow, the happy-clappy counselors and campers arose every morning with spirit just surging through their fingertips, while my hands searched for the closest cup of caffeine.\n\nI was in awe of their energy and became convinced their beds were hiding springs to help propel them from the warm sheets I couldn’t seem to leave. No matter how many times they spelled “S-U-P-E-R” or high-fived for friendship, one thing was clear: cheering was for the morning people, and I was not one of them.\n\nAfter reading the incredible details about Jesus’ ascension, I’m the first to claim my role as the story’s spectator, taking a step back to watch “The Resurrection and the Life” do His thing. Because that’s what you do with a miracle, right? You stare, applaud—maybe even cheer—and retell the tale to your wide-eyed grandchildren. It would seem our place is to stand in awe and wonder at what it might feel like to suddenly spring forward, being catapulted from death into life.\n\nBut because His grace toward us was not ineffective, we don’t just marvel at the power of the resurrection; we feel its rumble in our own hearts (1 Corinthians 15:10).\n\nChrist doesn’t want us to be courteous bystanders of His work on the cross. His hope is not for us to watch and wonder what it would be like to be raised by the glory of the Father. He came so that we could join Him and go wading in the resurrection waters with Him.\n\nChrist’s eternal transformation isn’t just a miracle to be proclaimed—it’s a change we get to feel and experience. Because we are joined in His likeness, when He is raised, so are we.\n\n“For if we have been joined with Him in the likeness of His death, we will certainly also be in the likeness of His resurrection… if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him.”\n\n-Romans 6:5,8\n\nWe join Him in defeating death.\n\nWe join Him in a heavenly home.\n\nWe join Him in grasping grace.\n\nWe join Him, and He transforms us.\n\nWe can find ourselves there with Christ in His resurrection, actively walking out the newness He purchased for us. He died and returned to life so that we can too. Christ’s resurrection purpose is to make us resurrected people. \n\nIf there were ever a reason to cheer, friends, this is most definitely it. May we be resurrected people today, seeing ourselves as we really are: dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Our Eternal Hope: What Will Become of Us?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nText: 1 Corinthians 15:12-34, 2 Corinthians 4:7-18\n\nOne of my favorite songs of all time is Nicole C. Mullins’ “My Redeemer Lives.” I’ll blast that tune from my car speakers, roll my windows down, and scream the lyrics at the top of my lungs. (Okay, I’ll probably have the windows up. I’m the only resident of the greater Nashville area that can’t sing, so yes, I hide behind my windows.) Banging my steering wheel out of conviction, I’m sure I look like I’m singing along to some pop ballad after a bad date. But nope—just praisin’ Jesus!\n\nI sincerely love this song. It is a faithful reminder of the assurance we have in Christ: our Redeemer lives. Our faith isn’t based on some fleeting idea or passing trend, but on the conviction and confidence that our Savior conquered death and is alive today. \n\nOur faith hinges on the resurrection of Jesus Christ. If He has not risen from the dead, then He has not conquered death. If He hasn’t conquered death, then death still has power over our lives. Most importantly, if Christ hasn’t been raised, there is no resurrection for us—no hope after death and no eternity with Christ. “If we have put our hope in Christ for this life only, we should be pitied more than anyone” (1 Corinthians 15:19).\n\nBut the resurrection is real. Jesus did conquer death and rise from the grave. Our Redeemer lives!\n\nFriends, this is the great treasure Paul spoke of in 2 Corinthians 4—the “extraordinary power” which can only be from God Himself and not from us (v. 7). We carry Christ’s death and resurrection in us—the power of His atonement and the glory of His resurrected life (v. 10). No matter what life brings, our hope is secure.\n\nIf I’m being honest, I don’t often treat the assurance of Christ’s resurrection like the treasure it truly is. Oh, I live like it’s valuable and worthy and excellent, but the greatest treasure? Sadly, not so much. Instead, I run around, spending my time like this life on earth is the only one I’ve got. I become easily distracted by what I think I need right now.\n\nBut this life and the things of this world are temporary. They will fade. Our troubles, our pains, our afflictions—they, too, will fade. But our living Redeemer will never die, and His resurrection power will never fade. As Paul goes on to say, “Even though our outer person is being destroyed, our inner person is being renewed day by day” (2 Corinthians 4:16).\n\nIn Mere Christianity C.S. Lewis wrote, “a continual looking forward to the eternal world is not … a form of escapism or wishful thinking, but one of the things a Christian is meant to do.”\n\nWe’re meant to live like we know where we’ll spend eternity—because we do! We’re meant to live as though our inner life and resurrection through Jesus Christ is real, both now and for eternity, because it is! We live with confidence in this eternal hope because our Redeemer is indeed alive. He alone is our hope. \n\n“So if you have been raised with the Messiah, seek what is above, where the Messiah is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on what is above, not on what is on the earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with the Messiah in God. When the Messiah, who is your life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.”\n\n-Colossians 3:1-4\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: 1 Corinthians 15:35-49, 1 Corinthians 13:8-12\n\nIf you’ve ever stared at the giant map in the mall, you’re familiar with the red dot. Like a North Star for shoppers, the red dot shows you where you are in relation to the retail world orbiting around you. It has a singular, important message to deliver to cartographically-challenged shoppers like myself: you are here.\n\nThe red dot is not the destination. No one wants to stay at the red dot, but we need to know where we are in order to figure out how to get where we’re going. The same principle applies to our eternal destiny.\n\nIf that word “destiny” just caused a switch in your brain to flip to off, flip it back on. Like so many of God’s ideas, the concept of destiny has become distorted.\n\nForrest Gump said it this way: “I do not know if we each have a destiny, or if we are all just floating around accidental-like on the breeze.” But destiny is not some cosmic tailwind that keeps us from floating willy-nilly. It’s not what we’d see if we could look into a crystal ball. It’s not a future sprinkled with moondust by a fairy godmother.\n\nOur destiny is simply our destination. \n\nWhen we think of eternal life, we can’t help but see it through the lens of the temporal (1 Corinthians 15:35). We ask questions like:\n\nAm I going to look like this in heaven?\n\nWill people still be married to their spouses?\n\nWill children still know their parents?\n\nWill my pets be in heaven too?\n\nIt’s hard to wrap our flesh-covered minds around eternity. Since we don’t know exactly what life will be like there, we tend to fixate on what life is like here. We park at the red dot, to which Paul’s response is, Don’t be foolish! Where you are now is not where you’re headed (1 Corinthians 15:36-37, my paraphrase). Instead of being the final destination, our current circumstances work like the red dot to orient us toward our destiny. Paul breaks it down for us in verses 42-44.\n\nOur red dot is corruption, but that’s not where we’re heading.\n\nOur destiny is to be raised in bodies that can never decay (1 Corinthians 15:42).\n\nOur red dot is dishonor, but that’s not where we’re heading.\n\nOur destiny is to be given “the unfading crown of glory” (1 Corinthians 15:43, 1 Peter 5:4).\n\nOur red dot is weakness, but that’s not where we’re heading.\n\nOur destiny is to experience the same resurrection power that raised Christ from the grave (1 Corinthians 15:43, Philippians 3:10).\n\nOur red dot is a natural body, but that’s not where we are heading.\n\nOur destiny is to spend eternity in a spiritual body, finally set free from the limits and decay our bodies know this side of eternity (1 Corinthians 15:44).\n\nWhat a hopeful truth! The red dot isn’t the finish line—it’s just the beginning. All of the things that scream, “You are here!” at us today, are reminders that we are destined to end up somewhere unfathomably better.\n\nThe bodies we’re in now will someday be laid in the ground. But six feet under is not our destiny. God’s Word invites us to lift our eyes and look ahead because where we are now is not where we’re going!\n\n“For now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror,\n\nbut then face to face.\n\nNow I know in part,\n\nbut then I will know fully,\n\nas I am fully known.”\n\n-1 Corinthians 13:12\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Our Eternal Victory: What Will Eternity Be Like?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nText: 1 Corinthians 15:50-58, Revelation 21:1-7\n\nHave you ever experienced a moment so good, so perfect and pure, that you wanted to freeze time? For me, those moments entail soft sand pressed between my toes, the hot sun hammering down, and the sound of the ocean roaring in the distance.\n\nMaybe for you, heaven here on earth is something else entirely, like watching your little ones sleep, or having the time of your life with close friends, or curling up by the fire with a good book. There are as many versions of paradise in this world as there are people living here. So it’s really no surprise, then, to see a million different renditions of heaven in everything from art and movies, to books and music, and even in our churches.\n\nGrasping the mystery of heaven is a challenge, especially when the things of God are too wonderful for us to understand (1 Corinthians 15:51, Psalm 139:6). Art helps us imagine a place we’ve not yet been. But without even realizing it, our view of heaven can be more informed by imagination and our own desires than the promises of God found in Scripture.\n\nThe season of Lent begins with Ash Wednesday, and for some believers, this includes a church service where ashes are rubbed across their foreheads in the sign of a cross, while these words are spoken over them: “From dust you came, and to dust you shall return” (Genesis 3:19). This act is a reminder of our mortality. But, lest you think Lent is a downer, remember this: the ashes are intentionally smeared in the sign of the cross—the promise of our own resurrection with Christ Jesus (Romans 6:5,8).\n\nEaster then becomes a celebration of His empty tomb and victory over death, as well as the pardoning of our sin and an eternal paradise spent with Jesus. But what will that promised eternity look like? The passages we read today give us a glimpse at three promises God makes about the new heaven and the new earth that are to come.\n\n1. We will be changed.\n\nIn Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians, he emphasizes that we will go from perishable to imperishable, mortal to immortal (1 Corinthians 15:53-54). While Jesus Himself was visibly changed after His resurrection, making it difficult for even His followers to recognize Him at first (John 20:15; Luke 24:13-5), some things remain the same. For instance, the scars a risen Jesus showed a doubting Thomas (John 20:27) indicate that marks of our lives here on earth might somehow exist even after resurrection.\n\nAs for our own resurrected bodies, Scripture promises us so much more than an ideal weight, a straighter nose, or shinier hair. We are promised resurrected bodies that will never decay—new bodies suited for new life (1 Corinthians 15:42-44).\n\n2. We will be freed.\n\nThe apostle John writes that in heaven there will be no death or pain or sorrow (Revelation 21:4). Eternity will be a place where we no longer hurt one another. There will be no more sad goodbyes and no more lists of regret. With no more sickness or hunger, we will be free from the pain that enslaves us here. And in the absence of these burdens, we will be filled with the fullness of joy (Psalm 16:11).\n\n3. We will be connected.\n\nJohn also tells us that God Himself will dwell with us in a way we’ve never experienced before (Revelation 21:3). He’s not just creating a perfect forever home for us—He plans to live there with us. We’ll never have to wonder if He hears our prayers because He’ll be more present in our eternal lives than we can imagine. No more feelings of distance or loneliness. In eternity, we will live in the constant face-to-face presence of our loving Father (Revelation 22:4).\n\nYou and I will never completely understand heaven in this life. But God gives us His Word, and we can read it and proclaim with glad hearts: “We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come” (The Nicene Creed). Thanks be to our good God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Annie Downs\n\nText: 1 John 4:7-19, Hebrews 10:19-23, 1 Peter 1:3-9\n\n“No one takes care of you except you.”\n\nIt’s a lie I hear, over and over again. One I have to battle to make disappear. In a world where being a 30-something single woman is more common than it has ever been before (and, in some ways, probably easier than it was a few decades ago), it can still have its aches and pains, just like any other season of life.\n\nI have dear family and friends who help in any time of need, but when it all comes down to it, I feel like I’m the only one who has my back. It can feel like I have no real assurance of someone else watching out for me, like no one is there to rescue me when I am drowning in a sea of work or finances or laundry or car problems.\n\nThis is my story.\n\nFor some reason, God has purposed and planned that my best life is right here, right now, even with the hurt and loneliness and worry that come right along with all the incredibly good things. This is what’s true, and the truth wins each and every time—if only I look to it.\n\nJesus is mine.\n\nI’ve known it since I learned this song as a tiny kid. It is my assurance, that Jesus is mine. When I feel forgotten and think no one sees me, He sees. When I think no one will step in, He always steps in, to provide and protect. When I need to be rescued, He proves, again and again, that rescuing is His specialty in my life (Colossians 1:13).\n\nAn assurance, by definition, is a promise that is meant to give us confidence. The writer of this hymn, Fanny Crosby, felt it deep in her soul, enough that as soon as the organ notes were played, the lyrics poured out.\n\nDid you know Fanny Crosby became blind when she was an infant? For nearly the entirety of her life, she lacked what so many of us have: sight. I recognize my own story in hers—in not having what others have.\n\nIt’s different, I know. But it’s the same, too, isn’t it? Can’t we all list something others have that we don’t? Something that can’t be earned or bought but is a gift that we just plain haven’t received? I think there’s something really beautiful about loving Jesus right there, right in the middle of that tension, where we recognize the gifts we haven’t been given by our good and perfect Father.\n\nClearly, I don’t know Fanny Crosby personally, as she died 100 years ago. But I almost feel a little wink from her in the second stanza.\n\n“Visions of rapture now burst on my sight . . .”\n\nIt’s like she’s saying, “whatever it is you think I don’t have, I have in Him.”\n\nWithout Jesus, without THE blessed assurance, she couldn’t see a thing. But with Him, there were visions of rapture.\n\nWithout Jesus, I am the only one who takes care of me. With Jesus, I am never alone. I am loved deeply by God, and therefore, I can love and be loved by others (Deuteronomy 31:6, 1 John 4:7-19).\n\nWhatever it is I think I don’t have, I have in Him.\n\nWhatever it is you think you don’t have, you can have in Him.\n\nBlessed assurance, y’all, Jesus is mine. That’s a promise that brings me great confidence. I pray it brings the same for you.\n\nPreach on, Fanny. We’re listening.\n\n“Let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm,\n\nfor God can be trusted to keep his promise.”\n\n-Hebrews 10:23\n\nBlessed Assurance\n\nFanny Crosby, 1873\n\nBlessed assurance; Jesus is mine!\n\nOh, what a foretaste of glory divine!\n\nHeir of salvation, purchase of God,\n\nborn of his Spirit, washed in his blood.\n\nRefrain:\n\nThis is my story, this is my song,\n\npraising my Savior all the day long;\n\nthis is my story, this is my song,\n\npraising my Savior all the day long.\n\nPerfect submission, perfect delight,\n\nvisions of rapture now burst on my sight;\n\nangels descending bring from above\n\nechoes of mercy, whispers of love. [Refrain]\n\nPerfect submission, all is at rest,\n\nI in my Savior am happy and blest;\n\nwatching and waiting, looking above,\n\nfilled with his goodness, lost in his love. [Refrain]\n\n \n\n",

I invited a boy that I really liked, drove my mom crazy shopping for just the right dark blue dress with sparkles, and when the night arrived I felt like a princess in braces. Over dinner, however, my date noticed my adorable best friend, dressed in black and glittering with charming conversation, completely oblivious to him. He continued to notice her all night. And well into the morning hours, I listened to him recount her virtues and wonder at her beauty.\n\nI felt silly. Worse, I felt insignificant and expendable, my blue dress and smudged eyeliner just an embarrassment. In the years that followed, I have learned not to base my self-worth on the opinion of teenage boys. In fact, I have learned that my self-worth isn’t even the point of my story. But I have not lost my longing to be treasured.\n\nThe story of Christ and His church is like a true fairy tale. He slays the dragon, rescues the princess, and takes her home to His kingdom. From heaven He came and sought her to be His holy bride.\n\nAs the church, we are Christ’s treasured bride. And He gives us our place, value, and significance. Don’t worry about your sparkly dress; Christ has something even better to offer. “He did this to present the church to Himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or anything like that, but holy and blameless” (Ephesians 5:27).\n\nBut the story of Christ and His church is greater, because this story isn’t about the worthiness of the church. The church isn’t the bride of Christ because we are the prettiest, cleverest, or even the most obedient. Christ is the one who makes us worthy, and we can find that self-worth in Him, for He is sure, steadfast, and faithful.\n\nChrist Himself is the center and foundation of the church (1 Corinthians 3:11). Samuel Stone wrote this hymn to highlight “the one holy church, and the communion of the saints” part of the Apostle’s Creed. And it’s such a good reminder that those whose foundation is based on Christ are all united in the one holy church.\n\nIn all of my longing to be treasured, I can miss the actual treasure: Christ. But instead of building my life on false hopes and imagined romances, I can look to the one foundation “who is also the head of the body, the church” (Colossians 1:18). In fact, I don’t need to build my life at all; Paul writes that we are “built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone” (Ephesians 2:20). So the building is already accomplished.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Psalm 32:1-11, Acts 2:38, Galatians 2:16\n\nIt was the song Oliver heard us sing to him from the time he was born. As we tucked him into his crib, then his toddler bed, then his big-boy bed—I would quietly sing in his ear, “blest is the man, forever blest, whose guilt is pardoned by his God…”\n\nSometimes he wouldn’t mind. I think he really liked it. Other times, he would interrupt me with important toddler questions about dinosaurs or characters on “Thomas the Train.” But I think he grew to love, and even expect, his weepy mommy singing hymns in his room, stroking his hair as he fell asleep. I can just imagine him telling his four-year-old buddies:\n\nIt is what it is, you guys. My mom cries more at bedtime than I do.\n\nOliver is nine now. (Nine-and-a-half, if you’re asking him.) I don’t sing to him often anymore—something even better has happened as he’s grown into a small version of a man. Instead of lying in his toddler bed, wearing robot jammies while he listens to the hymn, he now stands next to me in church on Sunday mornings, holding the sheet music (usually already covered in pre-church doodles), probably wishing he were still wearing robot jammies. If I quiet my own singing, I can tune into his voice joined with our congregation as the words “and not on works but grace relies” now come from his own lips.\n\nIt’s a good moment. Not because I’m a perfect mom. Not because he’s a perfect kid. Oh man, you guys, we mess up all the time— especially on Sunday mornings. (I’ve always thought Sundays were the most sanctifying days of the week; not because of the sermons, but because of the hours leading up to the sermons. That’s straight-up refining fire, y’all.)\n\nIt’s not a good moment because we’re good. It’s a good moment because we’re not. So whether I’m singing these words to my my son or to myself, or if he’s singing them along with me, we’re just reminding ourselves and each other that we are guilty and we need God. And that the Savior already bled and covered all our days—even our Sunday mornings. \n\n“Blest Is the Man” has been my prayer for the man God has given us to raise. Not just because Isaac Watts knew how to write a solid hymn, but because the lines of this hymn come straight from the pages of Scripture, through the pens of David and Paul and Luke and others. We pray this hymn in worship for our son, and for our daughter, and for ourselves, that though we fall short—though our unrighteousness is plenty—His righteousness pardons us in full.\n\nWhile bright the evidence of grace\n\nThro’ all his life appears and shines!\n\nBlest is the Man, Forever Blest\n\nIsaac Watts, 1719\n\nBlest is the man, forever blest,\n\nWhose guilt is pardoned by his God,\n\nWhose sins with sorrow are confessed\n\nAnd covered with his Savior’s blood.\n\nBlest is the man to whom the Lord\n\nImputes not his iniquities;\n\nHe pleads no merit of reward\n\nAnd not on works but grace relies.\n\nFrom guile his heart and lips are free;\n\nHis humble joy, his holy fear,\n\nWith deep repentance well agree\n\nAnd join to prove his faith sincere.\n\nHow glorious is that righteousness\n\nThat hides and cancels all his sins,\n\nWhile bright the evidence of grace\n\nThro’ all his life appears and shines!\n\n",

    "devo_title": "And Can It Be?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rev. Kevin Twit\n\nText: Philippians 2:5-8, Acts 12:6-8, Acts 16:25-26, Romans 8:1-4, Hebrews 4:14-16\n\nIn 1738, Charles Wesley was struggling to find peace with God. He had served as a missionary to Georgia, but that had turned out disastrously bad. Peter Bohler, the leader of the London Moravians, asked Charles if he hoped to be saved. Charles replied that he did. Bohler pressed, “Upon what basis do you hope to be saved?” Wesley said, “Because I have used my best endeavors to serve God.” Bohler shook his head sadly and walked away.\n\nWesley recorded his reaction in his journal: “What, are not my endeavors a sufficient ground of hope? Would he rob me of my endeavors? I have nothing else to trust to.”\n\nWesley was stuck in the tension that many raised in church have experienced. It is all too common to confuse the fruits of the gospel at work in our lives (good endeavors) with the root of spiritual life (the gospel promise believed).\n\nThe problem with trusting our good works is that they are not perfect works. Jesus said that we are to love Him with all our heart, all our mind, and all our strength, and this is a considerably higher bar than just offering Him our best endeavors.\n\nGod requires that we love Him perfectly from the moment we are born until the moment we die, with no lapses. Faced with this impossible requirement, many religious people attempt to take solace in such empty hopes as our best, though imperfect, endeavors. But this hymn points us to a higher ground of hope—the power of the gospel.\n\nLater in 1738, Wesley’s friend, John Bray, discovered Martin Luther’s Commentary on Galatians and brought it to Wesley, who was sick in bed. Luther had famously once said that the whole of the gospel was found in the personal pronouns, and Wesley found peace as the Lord gave him faith to believe that Jesus had died for him. Wesley wrote in his journal, “I spent some hours this evening in private with Martin Luther, who was greatly blessed to me, especially his conclusion of the second chapter. I labored, waited, and prayed to feel ‘Who loved me and gave Himself up for me.’”\n\nIt is sometimes said that “And Can It Be” was Wesley’s first hymn, written soon after his conversion. Hymn scholars are now convinced that “Where Shall My Wondering Soul Begin?” was actually his first hymn. But “And Can It Be” was written soon after and expresses beautifully and powerfully the converting power of the gospel that he had experienced.\n\nWesley is one of our most skilled hymn writers. He begins with a piercing question to which no real answer can be given: “How can it be, that thou my God, shoulds’t die for me?” If we ever get to the point where God’s grace seems deserved or expected, we are in deep trouble.\n\nWe see Wesley’s grasp of Luther’s point in his use of personal pronouns: “my God,” “for me.” But it is in the last verse where Wesley reveals the heart of his new-found hope. “Alive in Him, my living head, and clothed in righteousness divine.”\n\nWesley had come to understand that the gospel Christ gives us what God requires—His perfect righteousness through our union with Him. What Christ does, we get credit for; what He deserves, we get!\n\nRather than trusting in our best endeavors, Wesley gives us words to praise God for our only true hope, the righteousness of Christ imputed to His people through faith. This brings us not only hope, but boldness to claim the crown—not because of what we have done, but because of what Christ has done in our place.\n\nAnd Can It Be That I Should Gain?\n\nCharles Wesley, 1738\n\nAnd can it be that I should gain\n\nAn interest in the Savior’s blood?\n\nDied He for me, who caused His pain—\n\nFor me, who Him to death pursued?\n\nAmazing love! How can it be,\n\nThat Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?\n\nAmazing love! How can it be,\n\nThat Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?\n\nHe left His Father’s throne above\n\nSo free, so infinite His grace—\n\nEmptied Himself of all but love,\n\nAnd bled for Adam’s helpless race:\n\n’Tis mercy all, immense and free,\n\nFor O my God, it found out me!\n\n’Tis mercy all, immense and free,\n\nFor O my God, it found out me!\n\nLong my imprisoned spirit lay,\n\nFast bound in sin and nature’s night;\n\nThine eye diffused a quickening ray—\n\nI woke, the dungeon flamed with light;\n\nMy chains fell off, my heart was free,\n\nI rose, went forth, and followed Thee.\n\nMy chains fell off, my heart was free,\n\nI rose, went forth, and followed Thee.\n\nNo condemnation now I dread;\n\nJesus, and all in Him, is mine;\n\nAlive in Him, my living Head,\n\nAnd clothed in righteousness divine,\n\nBold I approach th’eternal throne,\n\nAnd claim the crown, through Christ my own.\n\nBold I approach th’eternal throne,\n\nAnd claim the crown, through Christ my own.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "How Great Thou Art",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellie Holcomb\n\nText: Psalm 121:1-8, Psalm 145:3-7, 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17\n\n“How Great Thou Art” always has a way of undoing me. Something happens to me each time I sing this old hymn, whether singing along with hundreds of other voices or alone in my car. The atmosphere seems to shift, and I’m left wondering what it is specifically about this hymn that causes such a stir within me.\n\nWhen Billy Graham was asked why he used the song so much at his crusades, he said this:\n\n“It glorifies God. It turns Christians’ eyes toward God rather than upon themselves. I use it as often as possible because it is such a God-honoring song.”\n\nAnd there you have it. It honors God and shifts our gaze away from ourselves back to our Father. He is greater than any joy this world has to offer, greater than any storm our souls will ever weather. \n\nThe past month has been filled with anxiety for me, and I’ve continually felt like a failure at life. There are so many things I’ve left undone—people I haven’t seen, phone calls I haven’t returned, and, after having a new baby boy, so much sleep I haven’t been getting. I feel like the worst version of myself, and yet as I read through this old hymn, I am once again reminded that the gospel isn’t really about me and how I’m doing. It’s about our great God and what He’s done for us.\n\nThe hymn began as a poem written by Carl Boberg in the late 19th century, but it was British missionary Stuart Hine who took the Russian translation of Boberg’s original and created the commonly known English version. Hine was on a trip through the Carpathian Mountains of Ukraine with his wife, preaching in a mountain village, when they were caught in a terrible storm. In awe as the thunder echoed throughout the mountains, Hine was inspired to write the first verse of his English paraphrase:\n\nO Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder\n\nConsider all the worlds thy hands have made,\n\nI see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,\n\nThy power throughout the universe displayed\n\nThat power Hine witnessed is the gospel power at work in you and me. Like the Psalmist penned, “I lift up my eyes to the hills—where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth” (Psalm 121:1-2).\n\nI love how this hymn helps me lift my eyes from my inadequacy to His sufficiency—from my not-enough to His always-enough. It helps me to remember the wonderful works He has done (Psalm 145:5) and to meditate on those, rather than circling around and around all the things I’ve left undone.\n\nI love how this song shifts my gaze—\n\nFrom my sin and mistakes to God’s sacrifice and grace.\n\nFrom my problems and pain to God’s power and mercy.\n\nFrom the mess of my heart to the beauty of His love.\n\nFrom the ache of this world to the hope of our true, eternal home.\n\nFriends, let’s gather ‘round and sing this song together today, turning our eyes from ourselves to our great God, proclaiming His goodness and faithfulness to our our own souls and to those around us (Psalm 145:3-7).\n\nThe same God who is over the storms, who created the hills and the valleys, comes down to be our helper. The same God who spoke the mountains into existence, who knit us together in our mothers’ wombs, sent His own Son to take our place on the cross. And that same God will come again one day to make all things right (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).\n\nI’m so thankful for the way this song helps us remind our souls of His greatness and His goodness. May we sing it together today, and remind one another of its truths every day.\n\nHow Great Thou Art\n\nCarl Gustav Boberg, 1885; Stuart K. Hine, c. 1949\n\nO Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder\n\nConsider all the worlds thy hands have made,\n\nI see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,\n\nThy power throughout the universe displayed:\n\nRefrain\n\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee:\n\nHow great thou art! How great thou art!\n\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee:\n\nHow great thou art! How great thou art!\n\nWhen through the woods and forest glades I wander\n\nAnd hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,\n\nWhen I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,\n\nAnd hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze:\n\nRefrain\n\nAnd when I think that God, his Son not sparing,\n\nSent him to die, I scarce can take it in,\n\nThat on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,\n\nHe bled and died to take away my sin.\n\nRefrain\n\nWhen Christ shall come with shout of acclamation\n\nAnd take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!\n\nThen I shall bow in humble adoration,\n\nAnd there proclaim, My God, how great thou art!\n\n",

A psalm.\n\nShout joyfully to God, all the earth!\n\nSing about the glory of His name;\n\nmake His praise glorious.\n\nSay to God, “How awe-inspiring are Your works!\n\nYour enemies will cringe before You\n\nbecause of Your great strength.\n\nAll the earth will worship You\n\nand sing praise to You.\n\nThey will sing praise to Your name.” Selah\n\nCome and see the wonders of God;\n\nHis acts for humanity are awe-inspiring.\n\nHe turned the sea into dry land,\n\nand they crossed the river on foot.\n\nThere we rejoiced in Him.\n\nHe rules forever by His might;\n\nHe keeps His eye on the nations.\n\nThe rebellious should not exalt themselves.Selah\n\nPraise our God, you peoples;\n\nlet the sound of His praise be heard.\n\nHe keeps us alive\n\nand does not allow our feet to slip.\n\nFor You, God, tested us;\n\nYou refined us as silver is refined.\n\nYou lured us into a trap;\n\nYou placed burdens on our backs.\n\nYou let men ride over our heads;\n\nwe went through fire and water,\n\nbut You brought us out to abundance.\n\nI will enter Your house with burnt offerings;\n\nI will pay You my vows\n\nthat my lips promised\n\nand my mouth spoke during my distress.\n\nI will offer You fattened sheep as burnt offerings,\n\nwith the fragrant smoke of rams;\n\nI will sacrifice oxen with goats. Selah\n\nCome and listen, all who fear God,\n\nand I will tell what He has done for me.\n\nI cried out to Him with my mouth,\n\nand praise was on my tongue.\n\nIf I had been aware of malice in my heart,\n\nthe Lord would not have listened.\n\nHowever, God has listened;\n\nHe has paid attention to the sound of my prayer.\n\nMay God be praised!\n\nHe has not turned away my prayer\n\nor turned His faithful love from me.\n\nDig Deeper:\n\nSing about the glory of our God! The author of Psalm 66 gives thanks to God by proclaiming His mighty deeds—even those which he calls tests from the Lord—and praising God for His awe-inspiring goodness and might. Let’s do the same today.  \n\nCome and listen, all who fear God,\n\nand I will tell what He has done for me!\n\n(make a list in your study journal and/or share in the comments)\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Exodus 33:18-23; Isaiah 6:1-3; Isaiah 57:15; Revelation 4:6, 8\n\nI’ve been singing this song since I wore my hair in pigtail braids. Maybe you remember singing it too. Did you notice how we say the word “holy” so many times? If I were editing this song for content, I would mark out a big chunk of holies with the note “redundant!” in the margin.\n\nBut is it redundant to call God holy three times? Is it just flowery and poetic, or is there real theological reason for this repetition? \n\nPoetry was in Reginald Heber’s blood. When he attended Oxford, his fellows threw him up on their shoulders and celebrated his earnest attempts at writing poems. They weren’t great poems, but that early recognition was enough to spur young Reg to a lifetime pursuit of verse.\n\nLike most rich young men in the early 1800s, Reginald was poised to take a Grand European Tour after graduation. However, Napoleon had disrupted normal business, and instead of sunning himself in the south of France, Reginald found himself traveling by sledge to Moscow in the middle of January.\n\nOne might assume that, after that chilling experience, Reginald would be content to warm his feet by an English fire for the rest of his days. Instead, this experience opened up the world for him.\n\nYears later, working in India as the Bishop of Calcutta, he continued to write poetry—both bad verses and beautiful ones. And somewhere between the foothills of the Himalayas and Bombay, he sat down to write his now famous hymn, “Holy, Holy, Holy.”\n\nJust like a winter vacation in Russia, some things seem destined to disappoint. But Heber learned that God is not like men; He does not fail. God is not just a little holy. He is superlatively holy: the most holy.\n\nBecause of our own unholy nature, it’s difficult for us to conceive of just how holy and other is our good God. We see everything through the lens of our human experience, and it’s difficult not to let our sight be marred and limited by our own impurity and sin. Many cultures impose human weakness on their gods (remember the petty and impatient Greek gods?), but our God is not made in our image. He is holy and set apart.\n\n“Holy, holy, holy” not only points us to God’s holiness, but also to the Trinity. The Trinity is unique to the Christian faith. Both God’s Holiness and His Trinitarian nature are foreign to us—but also absolutely vital. The unblemished majesty of God, in His Trinitarian perfection, sets Him apart from all of creation.\n\nTo understand God as He is, perfect in power, love and purity, will necessarily change how we see our world—disappointments, plans, and joys. God calls us to fix our eyes on Him and to see the beauty of His holiness, in the light of which the things of this earth grow dim.\n\nGod is both One and Many, Unity and Diversity. Let’s join all His works and praise His name, on earth, and sky, and sea.\n\nHoly, Holy, Holy\n\nReginald Heber, 1826\n\nHoly, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!\n\nEarly in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;\n\nHoly, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!\n\nGod in three Persons, blessèd Trinity! \n\nHoly, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee,\n\nCasting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;\n\nCherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,\n\nWho was, and is, and evermore shall be. \n\nHoly, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee,\n\nThough the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see;\n\nOnly Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,\n\nPerfect in power, in love, and purity. \n\nHoly, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!\n\nAll Thy works shall praise Thy Name, in earth, and sky, and sea;\n\nHoly, holy, holy; merciful and mighty!\n\nGod in three Persons, blessèd Trinity!\n\n* Source: The English Hymn: A Critical and Historical Study, by J.

For our church’s play, I was dressed as a blue hymnal named Psalty the Singing Songbook. And I had a solo.\n\nTake my life and let it be,\n\nconsecrated Lord to Thee.\n\nIt was my role to sing this entire song in front of our church, alone. So I practiced those lyrics, making sure I knew each couplet well. I could just see myself mixing up some of the lines and accidentally singing, “take my feet and let them move… let them flow in endless praise.” Which would be wrong. And sound weird.\n\nSo I worked hard after school each day to get every single word right. I sang upstairs in my bedroom and outside on my bicycle and waiting at the bus stop. Over and over. Every stanza.\n\nEven today, 25 years later, I can still hear myself singing it. I’m not the best singer in the world (I wouldn’t dare sing a solo now), but I belted out those words with confidence when I was a kid.\n\nI believed them then, the words to this old hymn. I can’t explain it any better than that, but I knew as I was singing that those words were true. Sometimes I think my childhood sang truer than the song my life sings today—less mess and fewer mangled-heart moments in the Annie vault, I guess. My little self meant every single word. I wanted my life to be His. \n\nI had no idea the power of the words I was singing. It didn’t register with my nine-year-old brain that I was proclaiming truth over my life, but I was. I didn’t know what it meant or what it would cost or how it would play out—none of us do, really—but I knew it was what I wanted.\n\nTake my voice and let me sing,\n\nAlways, only for my King.\n\nTake my lips and let them be\n\nFilled with messages from Thee.\n\nI believe these words today, just as I did when dressed up like a hymnal in 1989. It’s just that these days I have a little more baggage and a lot more grace. I’m also more assured that this is the path for me. This song, in particular, covers every part of my life: where I walk, what I say, the money I make, and the life I lead. It is all His.\n\nSomehow, as she wrote this hymn in the mid-1800s, Frances Ridley Havergal felt the same push in her soul that I still feel today—to say to God that all I have and all I am is for Him and His glory. There is no category of my life I want to withhold from Him.\n\nPeople in the Bible—folks who were just like us, not knowing where their lives were going or how their stories would end—said similar things. In Isaiah chapter six, we see Isaiah telling God that he was willing to go wherever God would send him (Isaiah 6:8). In the opening chapter of Philippians, Paul writes that, no matter his situation, he wants his life to glorify Christ, whether in life or in death (Philippians 1:20-21).\n\nSo, that is what we sing. And that may be why we sing. Maybe those lyrics say it braver and better than I ever could on my own. The innocence of my childhood voice may have gotten me here today, but it’s the conviction of my voice as an adult that keeps me here, by His grace—offering all I am, and ever will be, to Him.\n\nTake myself and I will be\n\nEver.\n\nOnly.\n\nAll for Thee.\n\nTake My Life and Let It Be\n\nFrances R. Havergal, 1874\n\nTake my life and let it be\n\nConsecrated, Lord, to Thee.\n\nTake my moments and my days,\n\nLet them flow in endless praise.\n\nTake my hands and let them move\n\nAt the impulse of Thy love.\n\nTake my feet and let them be\n\nSwift and beautiful for Thee.\n\nTake my voice and let me sing,\n\nAlways, only for my King.\n\nTake my lips and let them be\n\nFilled with messages from Thee.\n\nTake my silver and my gold,\n\nNot a mite would I withhold.\n\nTake my intellect and use\n\nEvery pow’r as Thou shalt choose.\n\nTake my will and make it Thine,\n\nIt shall be no longer mine.\n\nTake my heart, it is Thine own,\n\nIt shall be Thy royal throne.\n\nTake my love, my Lord, I pour\n\nAt Thy feet its treasure store.\n\nTake myself and I will be\n\nEver, only, all for Thee.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Be Still, My Soul",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sandra McCracken\n\nBe still before the LORD and wait patiently for him.\n\n-Psalm 37:7\n\nBe still, and know that I am God.\n\nI will be exalted among the nations,\n\nI will be exalted in the earth!\n\n-Psalm 46:10\n\nBe still my soul, be still. Ka­tha­ri­na A. von Schle­gel, the writer of this hymn, gives us many gifts in these words I carry around with me. Last week, I visited a chapel in New Jersey, a building about as old as these lyrics. I wandered into the dim, resonant space on that bright, autumn afternoon. The pews were empty but for a few folks milling about on the outside aisles. As I found my way to a well-worn bench toward the middle, I began to trace the storylines of the painted glass in the arched ceilings above my head.\n\nI marveled at the commitment of architectural design, artistic gifts, the time and resources it must have taken to create a place like this. Such beauty ushered me into stillness and conversation with God. An organist played hymns intermittently on the organ pipes, and each time he finished one, the room imploded into stunning silence. No applause. No cheers. No audible response necessary.\n\nLife is noisy. A hymn like “Be Still My Soul” gives me assurance that in the noise of life, my soul is held secure in the silence—silence that goes before and behind me. In the noise of my emotions or in daily work rhythms, the silence between the happenings is a constant. The silence helps me find my place in the world, to see who I am, and it makes space for my soul to listen to God. Even in the most joyful tones of life, as in music, the space between the notes is just as important as the notes themselves.\n\nHebrew scholar Ellen Davis translates the first verse of Psalm 65 in this way:\n\n“To you, O God, silence is praise.” \n\nSilence is praise? You mean I don’t have to say or prove anything? I can just be here, be who I am, where I am, and let the silence envelop me?\n\nLike Job’s declaration of God’s goodness in spite of his personal losses (Job 1:21), Katharina echoes:\n\n“Be still, my soul, your Jesus can repay,\n\nfrom his own fullness, all he takes away.”\n\nThese are challenging and comforting words, strung disruptively close together. The challenging part is the reminder that we are not the ones in control. If space is a kind of loss, the comfort of the stanza is this: like music notes on a page, we ought to submit ourselves to receive both the notes themselves (like joy) and the space between the notes (like loss) before God.  \n\nHe, in His fullness, is the Great Composer of our souls, moving us in and out of seasons, giving and taking away. Using both space and melody, He composes our lives into a symphony far more dynamic and beautiful than we ever could have written for ourselves.\n\nAdmittedly, we can’t always hear the music that is being written in us. Sometimes, the people around us can hear the song more easily than we can. It’s then that we need our friends to sing it for us and sing it to us.\n\nIn a hymn such as “Be Still My Soul,” in both space and melody, we are instructed in the practice of silence and the symphony of grace. We are encouraged to “be still before the Lord and wait patiently for Him” (Psalm 37:7). And we are invited to “begin the song of praise.”\n\n____\n\nBe Still My Soul\n\nwords by Ka­tha­ri­na A. von Schle­gel, 1752\n\ntrans by Jane L. Borth­wick, 1855\n\nBe still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side.\n\nBear patiently the cross of grief or pain.\n\nLeave to thy God to order and provide;\n\nIn every change, He faithful will remain.\n\nBe still, my soul: thy best, thy heavenly Friend\n\nThrough thorny ways leads to a joyful end.\n\nBe still, my soul: thy God doth undertake\n\nTo guide the future, as He has the past.\n\nThy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;\n\nAll now mysterious shall be bright at last.\n\nBe still, my soul: the waves and winds still know\n\nHis voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below.\n\nBe still, my soul: when dearest friends depart,\n\nAnd all is darkened in the vale of tears,\n\nThen shalt thou better know His love, His heart,\n\nWho comes to soothe thy sorrow and thy fears.\n\nBe still, my soul: thy Jesus can repay\n\nFrom His own fullness all He takes away.\n\nBe still, my soul: the hour is hastening on\n\nWhen we shall be forever with the Lord.\n\nWhen disappointment, grief and fear are gone,\n\nSorrow forgot, love’s purest joys restored.\n\nBe still, my soul: when change and tears are past\n\nAll safe and blessèd we shall meet at last.\n\nBe still, my soul: begin the song of praise\n\nOn earth, believing, to Thy Lord on high;\n\nAcknowledge Him in all thy words and ways,\n\nSo shall He view thee with a well pleased eye.\n\nBe still, my soul: the Sun of life divine\n\nThrough passing clouds shall but more brightly shine.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "There’s a Wideness in God’s Mercy",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Psalm 86:15; Matthew 20:16; Isaiah 53:5-6; Ephesians 3:14-19\n\nI once claimed a Dixie Chicks’ song as my “anthem.” If you haven’t heard of this pop-country group from the 90’s, you’re likely more qualified to write about hymns than yours truly.\n\nBut since you’re stuck with me today, I get to tell you just exactly why a beloved hymn of the Church reminds me of “Wide Open Spaces”— my teenage theme song, go-to karaoke choice, and lyrical inspiration for more than one boyfriend break-up.\n\nThe chorus goes like this:\n\nShe needs wide open spaces\n\nRoom to make her big mistakes\n\nShe needs new faces\n\nShe knows the high stakes\n\nThe truth is, I’d be hard-pressed to find another song with the same stride as my own steps. My sneakers practically lace themselves at the sound of wide open spaces, brand new faces, and room for big mistakes. Without question, I’d leave for a getaway to spacious ground with strangers who tip their hats in silence, leaving my story unchartered. I will always choose flight over fight, passport stamps over picket fences, and a fresh start over familiarity.\n\nIn the height of my Dixie Chicks days, I was afraid of what it might mean to slow down and stay. Suitcase in hand, I believed whatever I was facing was too big for the space I’d been given. My pride was too tall, my fear too deep, my anger too heavy, my grief too cumbersome, my questions too complicated. I hoped that free-falling into my next spontaneous choice would reverse the gravity of my own reality. And it did, but only because I bumped into the territory of Christ. \n\nAt that time in my life, God was the vaguely-loving being I sang songs about at summer camp. If He were to find me running away, I was sure He’d reprimand me and tell me to go home. But that’s not what He did at all. He was there, extending His mercy into the wide open and filling the spaces with His love. David knew the feeling: \n\nWhere shall I go from your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from your presence? If I ascend to heaven, you are there! If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there!\n\n-Psalm 139:7-9\n\nIn fact, there was more space than before: space for God’s grace, space to be found, space to be known, space to be welcomed, space to be home. Christ Himself was the spacious refuge I’d been looking for all along. \n\nHad I been born a century sooner, I’m convinced I would have been best friends with Lizzie S. Tourjee in high school. Lizzie, lacking the companionship of the Dixie Chicks, wrote the tune to the hymn “There’s A Wideness in God’s Mercy” for her school’s graduation ceremony. The lyrics for the hymn were taken from a poem written by Frederick W. Faber in 1854, titled “Come to Jesus.”\n\nThe thirteen-verse poem begins with words for a weary traveler: \n\nSouls of men, why will ye scatter\n\nlike a crowd of frightened sheep?\n\nFoolish hearts, why will ye wander\n\nfrom a love so true and deep?\n\nBeing rooted and established in Christ’s love fills us with all the fullness of God (Ephesians 3:17-19), extinguishing our need to run. Christ’s own arms, spread open on the cross, placed us within infinite mercy. Friends, there is room for us! \n\nFather, as we continue trusting You, may the size of Your mercy continue to surprise us. Keep us in the fullness Your love and presence. Amen. \n\n“He brought me out to a spacious place; He rescued me because He delighted in me.”\n\n-Psalm 18:19\n\nThere’s a Wideness in God’s Mercy\n\nby Fred­er­ick W. Fa­ber, 1854\n\nThere’s a wideness in God’s mercy,\n\nLike the wideness of the sea;\n\nThere’s a kindness in His justice,\n\nWhich is more than liberty.\n\nThere is welcome for the sinner,\n\nAnd more graces for the good;\n\nThere is mercy with the Savior;\n\nThere is healing in His blood.\n\nThere is no place where earth’s sorrows\n\nAre more felt than up in Heaven;\n\nThere is no place where earth’s failings\n\nHave such kindly judgment given.\n\nThere is plentiful redemption\n\nIn the blood that has been shed;\n\nThere is joy for all the members\n\nIn the sorrows of the Head.\n\nFor the love of God is broader\n\nThan the measure of our mind;\n\nAnd the heart of the Eternal\n\nIs most wonderfully kind.\n\nIf our love were but more simple,\n\nWe should take Him at His word;\n\nAnd our lives would be all sunshine\n\nIn the sweetness of our Lord.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellie Holcomb\n\nText: Hosea 6:3, Lamentations 3:22-24\n\n“Let us acknowledge the Lord; let us press on to acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises, he will appear; he will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth.”\n\n-Hosea 6:3\n\nTruth be told, I am a worrier in progress.\n\nI know I’m not supposed to worry. I know God calls us to trust Him and tells us He will carry our burdens (Matthew 11:28). But if I’m honest, a lot of days it feels easier to worry than to trust.\n\nI guess worrying gives me the illusion of control. I’ll lay in bed at night mulling questions or scenarios over in my mind: What if…? How will I ever…? What if I never…? And if I don’t have something to worry about today, I’ll often borrow worry from tomorrow. It’s a problem God is continually addressing in my life.\n\nBut there is one thing I never fall asleep at night worrying about, and that’s whether or not the sun’s going to come up in the morning. It’s a sure bet. And God promises that with each morning sunrise, He offers mercies anew and love unfailing (Lamentations 3:22-23). That, too, is a sure thing, yet I doubt it all the time.\n\nI am so grateful that God wrote His promises in the sky. He knew we would forget His love and His mercy and His faithfulness. So every morning, He instructs the sun to sing out a chorus of undeserved and unending love, a song of mercies anew.\n\nI love God’s promise in Hosea is that “He will appear” (Hosea 6:3). He doesn’t promise a problem-free life, or a life without suffering. He doesn’t say, “As surely as the sun rises, life will be easy and you will never struggle.” I’m so glad that’s not the promise He gives us because it wouldn’t ring true.\n\nWe all know this life doesn’t come without struggle and disappointment and hurt (John 16:33). We’ve all got unanswered questions and unspoken fears. The beauty of these verses to me is that God promises His presence. He promises that no matter what we are walking through, He will show up and He will be there with us.\n\nWhat are you worried about today, sisters? I’m praying that as we lift our eyes to the sky, we’d see evidence of God’s promised presence in our lives. Even on the days we can’t feel His presence, may we always know He’s there… as surely as the sun that rises each morning.\n\nAs Sure As The Sun\n\nby Ellie Holcomb\n\nThere is good news\n\nThere is good truth\n\nThat you could never change\n\nNo matter what you do\n\nYou are loved\n\nMore than you know\n\nMore than you could hope for\n\nAfter everything you’ve done\n\nAs sure as the sun will rise\n\nAnd takes away the night\n\nHis mercy will not end\n\nHis mercy will not end\n\nThere is good news\n\nThere’s a promise\n\nThat no matter where you go\n\nYou will never be alone\n\nIn the dark\n\nIn the doubting\n\nWhen you can’t feel anything\n\nOh, his love remains the same\n\nAs sure as the sun will rise\n\nAnd takes away the night\n\nHis mercy will not end\n\nHis mercy will not end\n\nEven through the night\n\nSilver stars will shine\n\nHope of glory’s light\n\nThat will wake us once again\n\nAs sure as the sun will rise\n\nAnd takes away the night\n\nAs sure as the sun will rise\n\nHis mercy will not end\n\nHis mercy will not end\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellie Holcomb\n\nAmazing grace! how sweet the sound\n\nthat saved a wretch like me.\n\nI’m running on about two hours of sleep today.\n\nI’m almost seven months pregnant, and I’ve been away from home for the past five days working. I’m doing work that I love, but today I miss my little girl. I miss my husband. I miss my community. I missed Mother’s Day and my little sister’s birthday. And now—because of a flight delay—I’m even missing out on the morning I was supposed to get to celebrate my sister before we pick up my daughter at school. On top of it all, I’m writing this in the back row of an airplane that does not recline, next to a man who does not seem to notice or care that I am pregnant because he’s taking up about half of my seat with his elbow room. For some reason, his lack of concern that I have any space at all, even though I am technically two people right now, is what has sent me over the edge.\n\nThe tears are flowing—which is fine, since said man next to me is paying no attention at all. I am maxed out. Spent. Exhausted. I can feel the discontent rising up in my heart. It sounds like inaudible curse words that I want to spit in anger towards this man next to me hogging the armrest.\n\nI know part of this is due to lack of sleep, but I also know that deep down, it is a heart issue for me. I have gone too hard for too long, and once again, I have tried to do too much of this life in my own strength. Yet here is the Lord in His kindness, reminding me to write about His amazing grace. I am cursing in my heart at a stranger, and God is calling me deeper into His grace—to receive it for myself, and to repent and offer it to those around me, even the armrest bullies. He is calling me to believe the truth of Romans 5:20: where sin abounds, grace abounds even more.\n\nI am ashamed of my gut reaction to my circumstances and grieved by my lack of gratitude, my fierce desire for independence, and my pride. But God loves me enough to meet me in my heart’s sickness (Jer 17:9). He leads me to write about His grace today that I might experience it again-—with eyes refreshed and sight regained (Jn 9:25). Amazing.\n\nSo what does grace sound like?\n\nFrom where I sit in the back of this airplane, it sounds like the gentle voice of the Holy Spirit asking me to let go of my anger, admit my weakness, and allow Him to replace my deficit with the surplus of His love. It sounds like God seeking me with His truth when I am lost in my sin (Luke 15). It sounds like God beckoning me to write about this strong, old hymn-—even when I’m feeling more wretched than redeemed—so I can experience, once again, the beauty and power and relief of His grace washing over me.\n\nTwas grace that taught my heart to fear,\n\nand grace my fears relieved.\n\nIt is because of God’s grace that I am able to see my weakness, my pride, and my not-enough. It is His grace that is more than enough to meet and cover me in all my broken, messy places (2 Cor 12:9). And it is His grace that brings me rest, as He tenderly instructs my heart to worship Him alone (Ps 86:11).\n\nDear sisters, there is unmerited, undeserved, and unbridled grace for us today and every day. It sounds like an invitation to rest in Jesus. It sounds like this beautiful, old song—a song we get to sing today, tomorrow and forever! And that truly is amazing.\n\nFather, would You continue to show me the offensive ways in my heart, that I may see my deep need of Your grace and know more deeply Your great sufficiency to meet my every need. Amen.\n\n____\n\nAmazing Grace\n\nJohn Newton, 1779\n\nAmazing grace! how sweet the sound,\n\nThat saved a wretch like me!\n\nI once was lost, but now am found,\n\nWas blind, but now I see.\n\n’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\n\nAnd grace my fears relieved;\n\nHow precious did that grace appear\n\nThe hour I first believed!\n\nThe Lord has promised good to me,\n\nHis word my hope secures;\n\nHe will my shield and portion be\n\nAs long as life endures.\n\nThrough many dangers, toils, and snares\n\nI have already come;\n\n‘Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,\n\nAnd grace will lead me home.\n\nWhen we’ve been there ten thousand years,\n\nBright shining as the sun,\n\nWe’ve no less days to sing God’s praise\n\nThan when we first begun.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sandra McCracken\n\nThou changest not; thy compassions, they fail not.\n\nAs thou hast been thou forever wilt be.\n\nI was a little intimidated to record a new version of “Great Is Thy Faithfulness” for this new She Reads Truth project, but I was also drawn to it for the same reason—because it felt like a challenge. Sometimes a song feels too big to reduce into a few chords.\n\nAs I started to work with this iconic hymn, I tried to zoom in on a particular memory to help me connect with the lyrics more deeply than surface sentimentality. I remembered how we sang that hymn in a close family friend’s wedding more than 20 years ago. I remembered my pink, handmade dress, the french braid in my hair and those uncomfortable dress flats. But as I traced the memory further, I remembered how that tumultuous marriage was, more or less, a long, slow trainwreck, and so I tried to push down that memory and think of another one instead. But the memory followed me around for a few days, and I realized maybe it was exactly this memory I needed to explore. \n\nIf I were sitting across the table from God having a conversation today, I would ask Him questions about His faithfulness and what it means in the loose ends of life—in the unresolved and ongoing bits. What is God’s role in the vow-keeping process between broken people trying to work things out? In our tender moments before bedtime, my sweet kids frequently bring up rather impossible-to-answer questions about life’s loose ends. They are so honest and direct, unfiltered and earnest in their asking. It makes me wonder how God might feel when we really stop to talk with Him.\n\nWhen I make space to ask God my own honest questions, I have found that, just like with my kids, talking about it together serves to deepen the intimacy between us. As we see in the Psalms, there is often more significance in the questions than the answers. The questions invite us closer to each other. When I finally get quiet, I find God is not afraid of honesty. He welcomes me. His love pushes out my fear. It’s gonna be ok. I’m here. I’ve got you. He presses in with His clarifying invitation: “Come to me, all you who are weary and heavy hearted” (Mt 11:28).\n\nLike a flashlight in a dark room, God’s faithfulness is the illumination that comes in and brings a mysterious relief when I am brave enough to say my fears out loud. We are not in control of the universe. We have limitations. But the limitations are part of who we are and they remind us with discomfort and distress signals—like little alarms going off in our lives—that we need a Savior. They remind us that we need human community, too. I need sisters to sit with me in these hard questions, and we need space to be together in the silence that comes after the question mark.\n\nWhen everything around and within us turns, “There is no shadow of turning with thee.” We try to make sense and find meaning in the patterns. Cycles and seasons pull us back and forth. We are tossed, habitually, by life’s waves and and occasionally realigned. People come and go in our lives. “Summer and winter and springtime and harvest.” We cannot yet see the whole picture. But God pursues us in our seeking, earnest to meet us in our sorrow and poised to celebrate with us in our joy.\n\nGod is the only constant. He is the unchanging centerpiece, holding all things together.  He holds our life circumstances. He is holding the chaos of this world. He is holding our hearts—holding us. In all things, He works for our good and for His glory. But this truth is progressively revealed, even as it is sure. Truth comes to us, but not all at once. The answers sometimes move painfully and articulate slowly.\n\nSinging the faith declarations in “Great Is Thy Faithfulness” with honesty is delicate work. I think you can almost hear the evidence of fragility and vulnerability in the sound of the recording. But there is strength there, too. I could recount to you a thousand mercies of God in my life. And many of God’s richest mercies have come in the hardest times. “He is close to the brokenhearted,” says the Psalmist (Ps 34:18). I am convinced ABOVE ALL THINGS that God’s faithfulness abides when all else fails. “Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.” How can this be?\n\nI look back and I see in my story, start to finish, that God has been so good to me. He comes to meet us, like Jesus at the tomb of Lazarus, calling Mary outside and weeping when He sees her face. He is ready to meet us with the sorrowful embrace of a friend. He is ready to meet us in the boat, waking from sleep in the middle of a chaotic storm, saying, “Peace!” (Mk 4:39). And He is ready to meet us in the heat of the battle, saying, “I will fight for you, you need only to be still” (Ex 14:14).\n\nGod is great. God is faithful. And His love is set upon us.\n\nWe come as we are, with trembling trust.\n\nPlease help us, Father. Bring your steadfast love to bear in our lives.

    "devo_title": "Be Thou My Vision",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Mandy Mann\n\n\n\nBe Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;\n\nNaught be all else to me, save that Thou art.\n\nThis morning I set out to ride my bike in the pouring rain. I’m training for my mid-life crisis triathlon. It’s a mini-triathlon, really; 400 meter swim, 14 mile bike ride, and 3 mile run. Nevertheless, it exhausts me to type that much physical activity, much less train for it. I figured if I’m heading over the hill this year, I might as well try to swim, bike and run over it.\n\nThe rain was cold and exhilarating this morning, waking me with each drop. There was a sweet smell of honeysuckle in the air, hinting towards eternity, and a small waterfall was forming off the front of my bike helmet making it hard for me to see. It reminded me of when my eye doctor prescribed my coke bottle-sized glasses when I was in the 3rd grade. I was nearsighted—like today, I could only see the road near me. Everything off in the distance was just a blur.\n\nThere’s something about training for a race that makes you think in terms of distance, focusing on the end goal. You begin to calculate the miles, getting so caught up in your vision of the finish line that you miss the beauty around you on the journey.\n\nDuring my rainy bike ride it dawned on me: too often I think of God in the distance, like a far-off God in the sky, listening to my lowly prayers from high above. Imagining Him this way causes me to create false rules in an effort to get His attention—if I get on my knees will He incline His ear to hear me? if I’m good enough, will He draw closer to me?—all the while forgetting that He promised to be near from the moment I gave my life to Him. In John 14:23, Jesus says, “My father will love him and we will come and make our home in him.” He says of His Spirit a few verses earlier, “But you know Him, for He lives with you and will be in you” (Jn 14:17).\n\nSo, the Holy Spirit is ALREADY in me when I pray? It is gospel truth, and it’s no less true just because it’s sometimes hard for us to believe.\n\nOur God is always near to us, even when our vision is unclear. I could feel the Lord nudging me awake to His closeness as I rode my bike through the park. He was leading me to green pastures and open spaces. He was wooing me with cool raindrops falling upon my skin, with the rhythmic sounds of water and my own breathing. My Savior was beckoning me with a green, glowing landscape and the sweet smell of honeysuckle, and the combination resonated deep within me. The smells and sounds and scenery were intimate, just like Jesus—His very name, Emmanuel, meaning “God with us.”\n\nAs this truth sunk in and I began to see God as near, because He always is, I began to smile and sing. Yes, I sang out loud, and yes, some more serious cyclists dressed in better attire than me heard, but I kept singing nonetheless: Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my HEART.\n\nFriends, it begins here, with the heart—the intimate place, the wellspring, the place we store up treasure. It is here in our hearts that we see God with the nearsighted vision that is a gift of the Holy Spirit, and it’s here that I began to sing that hymn differently. I sang it to my heart instead of to the sky, as I pedaled onward in the rain.\n\n____\n\nBe Thou My Vision\n\nattributed to Dal­lan For­gaill, 8th cent.\n\ntranslated by Mary E. Bryne, 1905\n\nBe Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;\n\nNaught be all else to me, save that Thou art;\n\nThou my best Thought, by day or by night,\n\nWaking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.\n\nBe Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;\n\nI ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;\n\nThou my great Father, I Thy true son;\n\nThou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.\n\nBe Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight;\n\nBe Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight;\n\nThou my soul’s Shelter, Thou my high Tow’r:\n\nRaise Thou me heav’nward, O Pow’r of my pow’r.\n\nRiches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise,\n\nThou mine Inheritance, now and always:\n\nThou and Thou only, first in my heart,\n\nHigh King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.\n\nHigh King of Heaven, my victory won,\n\nMay I reach Heaven’s joys, O bright Heav’n’s Sun!\n\nHeart of my own heart, whate’er befall,\n\nStill be my Vision, O Ruler of all.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_title": "What Wondrous Love Is This",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\n\n\nWhat wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul!\n\nWhat wondrous love is this, O my soul!\n\nOther than genes, I share a few distinct commonalities with my grandmother.\n\nWe both ditched our overly-Southern double names (so long, Mary Kaitlin and Mary Helen!), we were both born with a head full of chocolate-colored ringlets, and we both have a profound love for sour candy and sno cones, especially eaten together.\n\nI also owe my band geek pride and hymn-induced teary eyes to my grandmother, who, because she’d want you all to feel like close friends, I’ll refer to by her nickname, Polly.\n\nMy childhood summers spent in her humid Florida town were marked by fishing trips and blueberry picking, vegetable chopping and frizzy hair. At the end of the day, Polly was the only one brave enough to delicately comb through my thick, tangled locks, patiently unraveling knots and twists along the way. While most hairdressers would become overwhelmed with my violent tresses and send me home with wet hair, my grandmother would methodically see the process through until my mane was just so. Even when I reached for the scissors to quickly detach an unruly gnarl, she’d tell me to put them down, assuring that the cleansing process had worked before and this time would be no exception.\n\nI think Polly probably learned this lesson from her days as an elementary school music teacher. She would clink the keys of a worn piano, calmly teaching her students the technique of adjusting pitch and style. At the end of the class she would sit back and listen to a chorus of young voices singing her favorite hymn, washing her soul once more.\n\nI’m sure Polly introduced her students to “What Wondrous Love Is This.” If we were in her class today, she’d probably relish the opportunity to teach us about the history of the hymn, and we’d circle around her, sitting criss-cross applesauce style. (And we’d seriously hope she had jars of her homemade pepper relish in her bag, too, because YUM.)\n\nShe’d tell us how, although the hymn has become a staple in many sanctuaries, its original author remains unknown. Because it was written in the early 1800’s, it was passed down orally from person to person, which explains the repetition of easy-to-remember lyrics. While the tune varied each time it was sung, the words remained the same. Whether sung as a haunting tune in a minor key or a cheery, major-key march, the truths are unchanging. Then, in keeping with the tradition of this truth-filled hymn, Polly would have us set our sheet music aside and sing it by heart.\n\nShe always made sure we’d go home with the important things tucked in our hearts, and most of the time we didn’t realize their value until later. When I think about all the songs I’ve memorized over the years—my ABC’s, 50 Nifty United States, the books of the Bible, the Electric Slide—I begin to see they all serve a particular purpose: instruction or inspiration. It makes me lean in a little closer to hear the truths Polly would intentionally pass along to us via “What Wondrous Love Is This.”\n\nThis hymn—a song specifically addressed to our souls, the core of who we are—reveals the simple yet vital soundtrack of our humanity: the sweet shock of our Father’s wondrous love. Our 18th century friends did what we would also be wise to do—they identified the foundational truths of their faith, and they hung on for dear life. They memorized these truths backwards and forwards, set them to music and shared them in song.\n\nAnd when we sing these same words, we get to join in the same precious cycle: When we recount the wonders of the Lord’s love, it leads us to worship. When we worship, we are led back to His wondrous love. And through eternity, we’ll sing on.\n\nWhat foundational truths of the Gospel do you need to sing to your soul today? Which parts of the Father’s wondrous love do you need to hang onto for dear life?\n\nLike our favorite love song, let’s personalize these truths, set them to our own melody and pass them down.\n\nWhat Wondrous Love Is This!\n\nAmerican Folk Hymn, 19th cent.\n\nWhat wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul!\n\nWhat wondrous love is this, O my soul!\n\nWhat wondrous love is this that caused the Lord of bliss\n\nto bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul,\n\nto bear the dreadful curse for my soul?\n\nWhen I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down,\n\nwhen I was sinking down, sinking down;\n\nwhen I was sinking down beneath God’s righteous frown,\n\nChrist laid aside his crown for my soul, for my soul,\n\nChrist laid aside his crown for my soul.\n\nTo God and to the Lamb, I will sing, I will sing,\n\nto God and to the Lamb, I will sing;\n\nto God and to the Lamb who is the great I AM –\n\nwhile millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing;\n\nwhile millions join the theme, I will sing.\n\nAnd when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on,\n\nand when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on;\n\nand when from death I’m free, I’ll sing and joyful be,\n\nand through eternity, I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on,\n\nand through eternity I’ll sing on.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "When I Survey The Wondrous Cross",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\n\n\nDid e’er such love and sorrow meet,\n\nOr thorns compose so rich a crown?\n\nI once performed the hymn “When I Survey the Wondrous Cross” in Notre Dame Cathedral. Yes, it was just to the tourists who happened to be present. And yes, it was freezing in there, so our choir wore big, winter coats and shivered our way through the stanzas. But it was one of the most stunning, cherished experiences of my college life. The majesty of that place and the splendor of this song collided to create a moment I will never forget. (It didn’t even matter that I’m not much of a singer!)\n\nOur choir director was a petite German man whom we referred to with enormous affection as “Dr. B.” Dr. B had a way of bringing out the best in us—not just our best sound, but our best selves. He taught us to hold our words with reverence, to form our vowels with care, and to never draw out our S’s or mumble our O’s.\n\nWords like “cross” and “sorrow” and “demands” (sung “dih-mahnds”, with a heavy “d” and jaw dropped to the floor on the “ah”) somehow held more worship when directed by Dr. B, his arms moving sharply with the rhythm, eyes wide with calm intensity, and white hair flipped back in distinguished whimsy. He taught us to recognize the weight of the lyric we were singing and communicate it appropriately.\n\nWe weren’t just singing songs when we stood up in front of this small, powerful man. We were taking the melodies and lyrics carefully in, then offering them up to a beauty-starved world. We were doing important work and our perfect posture was proof that we knew it.\n\nI think of that time, now so many years ago, and I wonder—Do I faithfully regard the cross of Christ with as much reverence now as I sang it with then, from the rehearsal room risers to faraway cathedral walls? Do I hold the reality of those words in my heart as carefully and diligently as they deserve, with no mumbling, no air of flippancy? The honest answers to these questions cause me to bow down low, confessing my sin, “pouring contempt on all my pride” like the old hymn says.\n\nBut the glorious cross of Jesus does not leave me there in guilt of my sin. The same Savior who reveals the depth of my need fulfills it by His mercy and love. The Cross that begs my confession is the Cross that lifts my head to salvation.\n\nOur college choir ended every performance with this hymn. No matter the occasion or the other songs we sang, we always left it here—beholding the Prince of Glory’s wondrous cross.\n\nSisters, by God’s grace, let’s do the same. Let’s spend our days in awe of the suffering Savior who poured Himself out for us. With careful words and reverent hands, may we proclaim the amazing and divine love of Jesus, our richest gain. And when our show is over, be it days or decades from now, may it have been always and ultimately about that wondrous Cross.\n\nWhen I Survey the Wondrous Cross\n\nIsaac Watts, 1707\n\nWhen I survey the wondrous cross\n\nOn which the Prince of glory died,\n\nMy richest gain I count but loss,\n\nAnd pour contempt on all my pride.\n\nForbid it, Lord, that I should boast,\n\nSave in the death of Christ my God!\n\nAll the vain things that charm me most,\n\nI sacrifice them to His blood.\n\nSee from His head, His hands, His feet,\n\nSorrow and love flow mingled down!\n\nDid e’er such love and sorrow meet,\n\nOr thorns compose so rich a crown?\n\nWere the whole realm of nature mine,\n\nThat were a present far too small;\n\nLove so amazing, so divine,\n\nDemands my soul, my life, my all.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nHaircut days are some of the best days.\n\nI love sitting in the chair, making small talk with my stylist-turned-friend and knowing that, when I stand to leave, my hair will be better for the time I spent with her. I have no problem showing up with a dirty bun piled high on my head, no issue relinquishing creative control while we chat. I am perfectly willing to come as I am and let her do the work. We have a relationship, she and I, and I trust her to do magical things with my wayward locks. Seeing as how she is the professional and I am not, barging into our appointment and taking control of the scissors would be a bad move on my part. Trying to commandeer a process I don’t fully understand would not only be silly, it would have unfortunate and unsightly consequences. (My one and only attempt at a self bang-trim was sufficient proof of this.)\n\nMy hair stylist, though lovely, is not the Holy Spirit, so the metaphor only goes so far. But as I read today’s text, it’s clear the Me who seeks to be a fruit-bearer for the Kingdom could stand to take a few tips from the Me who sat in the salon chair two days ago. I don’t want to insist on creating my own goodness; I want to learn the art of trusting the only One who is truly good.  \n\nIn his letter to the Galatians, the Apostle Paul states the clear contrast between our rotten, self-made fruit and the good, God-made and God-pleasing fruit of the Holy Spirit:\n\nNow the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, moral impurity, promiscuity, idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and anything similar. I tell you about these things in advance—as I told you before—that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.\n\nBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law.\n\n(Galatians 5:19-23, HCSB)\n\nUntil we repent of our sinfulness and lean wholly on the perfection of Jesus, we humans remain stuck in the cycle of that first list, powerless to break free. Even works of flesh we believers call “good” cannot gain us entrance to the Kingdom of God. But when we call out to Christ for salvation, we receive mercy, forgiveness, and freedom—and we receive the Holy Spirit, a gift promised by Christ Himself.\n\nTake a look at John 14:15, when Jesus issues His disciples a tall yet serious order: “If you love Me, you will keep My commands.” Easier said than done, they may have thought. But Jesus doesn’t stop there; He explains how they are to keep His commands. This is more than a to-do—this is His Spirit at work in them!\n\n “I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Counselor to be with you forever. \n\nHe is the Spirit of truth… I have spoken these things to you while I remain with you. But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit—the Father will send Him in My name—will teach you all things and remind you of everything I have told you.”\n\n(John 14:16-17, 26)\n\nJesus knows us all the way through. He knows our forgetful hearts. And in His grace He leaves His very Spirit to be our helper, our comforter, our advocate. This is Christ’s gift to us, the far-off ones, bringing and keeping us close to God—not a “reach out and touch you” kind of close, but closer still. As close as our own breath is the Spirit of Christ to us. That is not mere hope or speculation, that is a promise from God’s Word! (See Romans 8:9-11.)  \n\nFriends, those good things Paul lists in Galatians 5:22-23 are not borne of our best efforts. The fruit of the Spirit is borne only of the Spirit. Only by abiding in Him, resting in His goodness and trusting Him to do the hard work of redemption on our behalf, can we bear fruit. \n\nAs we begin these 12 days of discovering the Spirit’s fruit as presented in Scripture, let’s repent of every bit of goodness we’ve tried to squeeze out on our own. Let’s lay down the fruit we’ve tried to produce with good intention, self improvement and striving, and let’s see God as the source of everything good. May we hide and abide in the perfect life and love of Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nSaturdays were pancake days. Regardless of what activities the day held, it always began with batter and blueberries.\n\nI would come down the stairs mid-morning, always last and always late. Sometimes we had additional guests, phone call interruptions or fluctuating appetites, but the scene was always the same:\n\nI knew my brother would want milk, and seconds.\n\nHe knew I wouldn’t be mad if he used all of the syrup.\n\nI knew my dad would request coffee first, pancakes later.\n\nHe knew I would eat the most blueberries.\n\nI knew my mom would mention how my Papa used to call them ‘hotcakes.’\n\nShe knew I would want to flip the “pancakes, not hotcakes!” myself.\n\nThey all knew not to talk to me before 8 am.\n\nOne night I sleepily told my mom, “I love you more than blueberry pancakes!,” because in my opinion, there was nothing better. We began using the phrase frequently and, although I  outgrew my small plate, twin-sized bed and eventually my quaint hometown, I would never outgrow this phrase that said I miss you, I love you, I can’t wait to see you again, and I’ll always be there, all in one.\n\n“Love you!”, my mom texted to me on my first night in my college dorm. “Love you more than blueberry pancakes!”, I replied. I knew I was trading pancake Saturdays for dining hall delicacies (I was clearly mislead), but the thought made me look forward to the next time I’d be home with my mom and her mixing bowls. It tasted even better in my mind than in my mouth.\n\nBefore you think I’m leading you to measure your love in terms of actual fruit, look again at the end of 1 Corinthians 13, where Paul is also looking forward to something:\n\nFor now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\n\n-1 Corinthians 13:12\n\nDoes anyone’s heart LEAP and get crazy excited about heaven when you hear this? Me too, me too!\n\nThe type of love we are given as a fruit of the Spirit is agape love, which is a goodwill, benevolent, brotherly kind of affection. In fact, one of the most well-known passages about love—1 Corinthians 13—concludes with Paul’s beckoning description of heaven, and I don’t think that’s a coincidence.\n\nFriends, the love of Christ in us makes us a sisterhood joined by the heart-leaping hope of Heaven. This love—an earthly display of eternal perfection—is the essence of Jesus’ life, death and resurrection. And, it is ours as a gift! His love for us fuels our love of others while we await our great going Home. \n\nIn his book The Four Loves, C.S. Lewis says that loving others as ourselves “is an image, a foretaste of what we must become to all if Love Himself rules in us without a rival.” Love is the result of God in us. We truly do love because He first loved us. This love is viewing others through a heavenly lens, a God-given tool to fasten our heart strings to the hope of Glory.\n\nWe are a family standing in the waiting room of Fully Known, determined to exchange a foretaste of what’s to come. And so, whether it be through words, actions or pancakes, may our love always be a result of Jesus’ love for us—a reminder that we are His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sarah Matheny\n\nThis spring has been one of the rougher seasons for our family. We’re coming off 12 weeks (yes, 3 months) of solid illness and injury, and I’m figuratively and literally limping to the finish line. An examination of my googling history tells the story. I’ve searched everything from “Benadryl dosages for itchy kids” to “physical therapists for herniated disc,” “rare skin rashes” to “do the terrible twos automatically end on the third birthday?” (I’m still holding out hope on that last one.)\n\nSo when asked to share about joy today, I admittedly lifted my still sinus-infected head to the heavens and said, “Really, God?! You’re giving me joy?” I confess that lately my life has felt, in a word, joyless.\n\nI’ve done all the “joy capturing” exercises in an attempt to shape up. I’ve made the gratitude lists, numbering those things that give me moments of happiness in my day: matcha lattes, husband-emptied dishwashers, YouTube videos of pets underestimating the distance from the coffee table to the couch. I’ve searched so hard to see every blessing in my life and my present circumstances. And yet, amid grief and hardship and hurts, I come up short.\n\nIt turns out joy is kinda like the car keys that slipped between the cushions of my favorite easy chair—I’m looking for it in all the wrong places.\n\nTrue joy is not something that can be conjured up or willed. Joy exists apart from our control—we simply choose whether or not to enter in. Joy, the Psalmist tells us, is given in God’s presence. It will never end, never fall short, never disappoint (Psalm 16:11).\n\nJoy is not momentary pleasure—it is the deep and lasting condition of our relationship with God this world cannot steal away. Christ tells us, “Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy” (John 16:22, NIV).\n\nMy exercises of gratitude for things of this world cannot produce because joy is not a fruit of our work, our circumstances or ourselves. Joy is a fruit of God’s Spirit. It is a manifestation of who He is, a result of the heart-transforming power of Jesus Christ in us.\n\nWe are commanded time and time again in Scripture to “rejoice,” “be joyful” and even consider trials as “pure joy.” Why? Because Jesus is always, always worthy of our rejoicing. If we label our lives as joyless, it is due to our misplaced hope and pleasure in things of the world rather than the joy of our salvation.\n\nSo, I have a new joy exercise plan. I will admit the wrong places, albeit sometimes good places (my family, my work, my community), where I am looking for joy and surrender them to God. I will ask the Holy Spirit to bear the fruit of joy in my life with the prayer, “Lord, remind me of the joy I have because of what You have done!” I will—joyfully!—look to His Word and rest in His promises.\n\nThen I will hit my knees, bow my still sinus-infected head and pray, Really, God. YOU are my joy. \n\nFor you, O Lord, have made me glad by your work;\n\nat the works of your hands I sing for joy.\n\n– Psalm 92:4, ESV\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI have one really firm rule in my house: only one person can cry at a time.\n\nWe have a few caveats.\n\nNumber One: If someone is already crying, you can’t add in your four choruses of the sob serenade until the first cryer is finished.\n\nNumber Two: The youngest cryer gets precedence, so if you are crying and someone younger than you begins to cry, you just have to dry up until the baby stops crying, at which time you may resume.\n\nNumber Three: It’s all hands on deck to help the youngest stop crying.\n\nBelieve it or not, this actually kind of works. Until it doesn’t. I instituted this rule years ago because I was DYING for peace in my home. We had four kids under four, which means so much poop and crying.\n\nUnfortunately the key to peace isn’t just keeping the volume and stink at bay, though I wish it were that simple. It’s easier for me to work on the behavior of my children or the condition of my home than to look at the state of my own heart.\n\nDo you ever find yourself sitting cross-legged on the floor of your life, looking around at all the screaming pieces and groaning, “I just want peace”? I do this all the time.\n\nIt’s hard for me to admit my version of peace isn’t actually real peace. My version of peace is everything under control, my control—books alphabetized and noses wiped. True peace is a soul rightly aligned with the way of Christ.\n\nBut, goodness, alignment of my soul to Christ sounds pretty heady for a girl who is typing one-handed while nursing a baby who is triumphantly filling his diaper. I don’t know a lot about peace or alignment. Thankfully, we have God’s Word to consult on the subject! James says, “a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace” (James 3:18 ESV). That sounds SO GOOD! I want to sow seeds of peace and reap giant peace gourds and watermelons! I want to arrive at harvest time to a whole heap of peace.\n\nI think James is saying that our daily, quiet acts of peace—listening to someone who is super needy, emptying the dishwasher when it’s not our turn, letting someone else win—gently nudge our souls into alignment with the peace of Christ.\n\nAnd then, when our little boats are sailing in the wake of His ship, we see how wayward and wobbly our course is, how imperfectly and poorly we make peace. But we also see how great is the wake of Christ. It hems in our feeble steering. The closer we draw to Him, the more we see that peace is not something we make. Rather, Christ’s peace He gives to us, not as the world gives it.\n\nToday—when you wrangle your loud baby-blessing, when you can’t see over the pile of bills, or when your friends don’t make any sense—let your strivings fall away and breathe in the peace of Christ, because He promises, “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you.”\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nWhen I see the word patience listed in Galatians 5 with the other fruit of the spirit, I groan. I’m reading happily along with love, joy and peace, and then… patience. Ugh, I say to myself. I know I’m not patient. Just watch me try to fold a fitted sheet.\n\nTemper tantrums, waiting, inconvenience—this is what I think of when I think about the word patience. But patience, as talked about in the Bible, is much more than remaining calm in the midst of fitted-sheet frustration.\n\nTake the new believers in the book of James as an example. These people were Jews recently converted to Christianity. Because of their new beliefs, they were rejected by their own people. Their own families. They were persecuted by everyone around them, and James tells them to do what? “You also must be patient,” he says. “Strengthen your hearts because the Lord’s coming is near” (James 5:8 HCSB).\n\nThe Greek word often for used for patience in Scripture is makrothyemia, which means… well, it means words that make me uncomfortable, such as:\n\nLongsuffering\n\nSlowness in avenging wrongs\n\nSteadfastness\n\nForbearance\n\nPatience is much deeper than something you practice when someone is hogging the bathroom. Patience—the longsuffering kind of patience—is something that arises when real trial strikes.\n\nA few months ago my own longsuffering was tested. I went through a period of anxiety like I had never experienced before. It landed on me heavy, like a weight, and didn’t leave for a few months. Small, daily tasks felt almost impossible. My thoughts turned dark. I shouldn’t be feeling this way, I told myself. I’m on the cusp of a new career and a new relationship. Things are going well! Yet, I woke up and went to sleep exhausted, anxious, sad, and weary.\n\nI would like to say that in this dark time I turned to God and said, “I trust you. I don’t understand what’s happening, but you do.” I wish I could tell you I did that, but no. Instead, I shook my fist, and I shook it hard. I was angry at God, and I tried desperately to escape the anxiety and darkness by my own means.\n\nYou could say I was the opposite of longsuffering. I was short-suffering, tiny-suffering, microscopic-suffering. I realized in those few months that my pain threshold is nearly nonexistent and, even still, I know most of you reading this have weathered much worse. My life was not bearing the fruit of patience because somewhere deep down inside of me I didn’t trust my God. And somewhere even deeper inside of me, I had lost hope and convinced myself I was alone.\n\nBut there’s an amazing thing about the word longsuffering in the New Testament: it is almost always an instruction given in the context of hope.\n\nRomans 8 says, “For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together with labor pains until now… We ourselves who have the Spirit as the firstfruits—we also groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies” (vv. 22-23 HCSB).\n\nAnd in Galatians 6:9, we’re told, “We must not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don’t give up” (HCSB).\n\nWE groan. WE don’t give up. I love that word “we” because it means we are not in this suffering thing alone. Better still, we do not wait without hope! As Matthew Henry says, we can look at our circumstances “with an eye to a future glorious recompense: Be patient to the coming of the Lord.”\n\nWe do not wait in vain. We wait for our God—the God who has promised and secured our full redemption through Jesus Christ.\n\nUltimately, it was my community who pulled me out of the dark time. They reminded me of who God is and who I am in Him. They reminded me of His love, and after a while my anger dissipated into something that looked a little more like patience, a little more like longsuffering.\n\nMay we do the same for each other in the face of our trials. Let’s longsuffer (yes, I made this a verb) together. Let’s look at our lives with an eye to a future glorious day when suffering is but a long, forgotten memory of this earth.\n\n \n\nAndrea Lucado is a freelance writer and Texas native who now calls Nashville, Tennessee, home.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Hayley Morgan\n\nThese days we talk about random acts of kindness and “paying it forward” like we’re running some sort of karmic racket, doing good things as a way to score more points for the Nice Team. But kindness as a fruit of the Holy Spirit has less to do with the good deeds of our outer lives and more to do with the posture of our inner lives.\n\nBiblical kindness is an outward fruit of the inward work of the Spirit. We are kind as a way of being more than a way of doing.\n\nI have a friend who is always unnecessarily kind to me. She shows me more mercy than I can imagine. She believes the best of me and she hopes for more of Jesus in my life. She suffers through not-so-pleasant times in our friendship for the sake God’s glory and our good. Her kindness to me mirrors the kindness of Christ.\n\nThe Greek word for kindness used in Galatians 5 is chrēstotēs, which means “moral goodness” and “benignity.” Benignity means bringing a person no harm. Christ uses the root of this word chrēstos in Matthew 11:30, when He says His “yoke is easy”—meaning, it doesn’t needlessly burden.\n\nWe also know from Scripture that being kind is much more powerful than just being nice. Romans 2:4 tells us that God’s kindness leads us to repentance. In other words, kindness has the power to transform. It is not weak, it does not ignore, it does push things under the rug. Kindness can change our own lives and the lives of those we love. In Ephesians 4:32, we are commanded to be kind and compassionate to each other, forgiving others just as God has forgiven us. It is this forgiveness from God—and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in us—that prompts our kindness to others. Think of our kindness as a sort of through-line for God’s goodness to us. We have the privilege of pouring out that kindness from the Holy Spirit to others! We get to mirror the kindness of Christ, kindness that leads to life-changing repentance.\n\nThe Christlike kindness my dear friend shows to me is not simple. It requires abiding in the Source, yielding to the Spirit, and submitting to the Heavenly Father. But, as a result of her obedience, I feel unconditionally accepted. I know, by God’s grace, she never means me harm or burden me with a mantle that isn’t mine to bear.\n\nIn a world where kindness is often used as a tool for getting ahead, it’s incredibly comforting to encounter those people who embody biblical kindness. Will we be those people today? The fruit of kindness is proof of the Holy Spirit’s good work in our hearts. It is powerful to change lives by pointing others to Jesus, the true Source of everything good.\n\nWhat could be sweeter than that?\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nI was always a good kid.\n\nAsk my parents and I think they’d tell you, I was a joy of a daughter to raise. (Tell ‘em, Mom!) I never really gave any trouble when it came to boys, I had absolutely no interest in the shenanigans of drugs or alcohol, I was an excellent student, great friend, medium athlete and a conscientious includer of people. When we studied the fruit of the Spirit in my high school theology class, “goodness” was one of those fruits I was pretty sure I was nailing—no Spirit necessary for this one, thankyouverymuch. Being good was easy! Just look at how impressive I was!\n\nAh, the overconfidence of youth. I remember sitting up late one night on our senior class trip to Florida, riding shotgun with the bus driver while the rest of the class slept. We barreled down the highway somewhere between Toledo and Orlando while I flapped my adorable jaw about how I knew everything there was to know about God and the Bible. After twelve years of private Christian education, I really saw no need for further study of Scripture or pursuit of additional spiritual instruction. I was relatively confident graduation would procure for me both a high school diploma and my own personal sanctification certificate, all in one march across the stage.\n\nDarkness.\n\nI was in spiritual darkness. Not because my life showed all the signs of rebellion and bad news, but because my soul had no need for a Savior, or so it thought. I assumed I had saved myself through years of right answers and right behavior. But at 18 years old, my goodness wasn’t enough to save me—it was actually separating me from Christ.\n\nThe bus driver that night didn’t tell me all the hundred ways I’d gotten it wrong or laugh me off the bus. It was worse than that—he wasn’t impressed by me. In the honesty of that moment, just two people and a whole lot of highway, all the words I’d served him didn’t return the usual, “Wow, you’re such a great kid!” that I was used to. Instead, he looked concerned. That was new and puzzling for the good girl accustomed to good reviews. We sat quietly after that—me, the bus driver and the Holy Spirit. And God was at work in my “good”/dark heart, revealing a need for Him I’d honestly never noticed before.\n\nIt turns out, God wasn’t impressed by me either. The act of goodness, kindness, self-control and so-on that I had perfected (and was sure would save me) was the very thing of which I needed to repent. My acts of righteousness were exactly the bad fruit Jesus warns us about in Matthew 12—produced from the upside down heart of a girl who thought her behavior made her a believer.\n\nSlowly but surely, in the days and months following that night on the bus, the Holy Spirit gave me eyes to see that God wasn’t commanding me to bear fruit to begin with—fruit-bearing was the job of the Holy Spirit. Rather, God was beckoning me to abide in His presence, like Jesus tells His disciples in John 15.\n\nI love the way David talks about God’s shepherd-like presence in Psalm 23. God is near to him—leading and restoring him, even in the valleys. David writes in verse 6, “Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.” He understands God’s nearness doesn’t make him good, but that goodness and mercy are always with him because the Lord is with Him. God is good, so the fruit of God’s Spirit, or presence, is goodness.\n\nFriends, whenever we think we can do goodness on our own, we are saying we can be the essence of God without the presence of God. But we can’t! Ephesians 5:8 tells us, “at one time you were darkness.” I was, too. All of us. And we’re learning again and again and again: our self-made fruit does not rid us of our darkness—it doesn’t have that power. Only God can make us light.\n\nEven when we fool the whole world with our goodness, God sees and knows our hearts better than we know them ourselves. May His goodness follow us as we draw near to Him, and may we may dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\n\n“Oh, how abundant is your goodness!”\n\n– Psalm 31:19\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Faithfulness",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Diana Stone\n\nHave you ever looked around at the wonderful, beautiful things your Christian friends are doing in their lives and thought, When I build up a little more faith, that will be me. Or, One day when I have faith like that, I’ll let God know I’m ready for Him to use me.\n\nI want to be used for an eternal purpose. Really, I do. I long for my life to be completely His, yet I hold back, assuming everyone doing those big things must have big faith—faith much greater than mine. So, naturally, when I saw I’d be writing on faithfulness, my first thought was, Ah yes, faith… that’s something I need to work on. It was only when I started digging into my study of faithfulness that I realized the irony of my statement. Faithfulness is a fruit of the Spirit, not a fruit of my efforts.\n\nFaith is something present in us from the moment we give our life to Christ, accepting that His death has covered our sins and we are fully forgiven, our life now hidden in a bigger purpose than our worldly satisfaction. According to Ephesians 2:8, this faith is a gift to us from God Himself! Hebrews Chapter 11 (a.k.a. the “Hall of Faith”) lists person after person who took the faith they were given and walked in faithfulness to God’s promise, a promise they believed but could not yet see.\n\nFaith is the conviction that Jesus Christ is our only salvation.\n\nFaithfulness is remaining in that truth, holding fast to the faith.\n\nThe issue is not the quantity, or “bigness”, of my faith so much as Who I’ve put my faith in.\n\nThe disciples in Luke 17:5 say to Jesus, “Increase our faith!” His response is probably not what they expected: “If you have faith the size of a mustard seed… you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you” (Luke 17:6). Even Jesus’ own disciples—the men who walked with Him, saw His miracles with their own eyes, listened to His words firsthand—are told it is not the size of their faith that matters. Instead, Jesus compels them to turn their small faith into lives of much faithfulness—remaining in and acting on the faith they’ve been given. \n\nThe fullness of God’s purpose for each of us comes when our faith propels us to offer up our lives for the glory of the Kingdom. Not later, when we feel more qualified or can see just where He’s leading us—but right now, just as we are.\n\nWe serve a God whose speciality is redemption. He says to us, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9 ESV). Our Lord doesn’t require perfection or faith the size of a mountain. He asks for a humble heart willing to stand fast wherever He leads.\n\nToday, as we go about our lives and ponder our circumstances—whatever they may be—let’s remember Jesus Christ, the source and object of our faith. The One who gives us faith is the One who makes us faithful when we remain in Him. Rather than listening to the lies of the Enemy who wants us to believe our broken pieces and small faith make us ineligible to be used by God, let us cling to our mustard seed of faith and believe in the unseen promises of God. Oh, Lord, by the power of your Holy Spirit, make us faithful. Amen. \n\nThen I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Who should I send? Who will go for Us?” \n\nI said, “Here I am. Send me.”\n\n–  Isaiah 6:8\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Vivian Mabuni\n\nHelen’s eyes were kind and steady. Deep, deep brown like a doe. I admired everything about her. We spent my first year of college in Bible study together and had grown to become good friends. The college ministry we were involved with sent students all over the country and around the world on summer missions. Most of our friends were off to those exciting, exotic locales serving God and we were stuck back at home taking summer school classes and working. We decided to stay connected and support each other throughout that summer by meeting together for Bible study.\n\nI grew up culturally Buddhist. In high school I began a relationship with Jesus, so the Christian faith felt relatively new. Helen was not only two years older than me; her spiritual maturity exuded a deep, intimate relationship with God and her knowledge of the Bible proved equally admirable. I happily anticipated time with Helen in hopes of becoming more like her.\n\nWe sat cross-legged on a large boulder next to a babbling stream. Our Bibles open, the birds chirping, the sky a Colorado summer vibrant blue…a truly picturesque, Pinterest-worthy scene.\n\nWe closed our eyes to pray for our friends far away and for each other.\n\nI opened one eye in time to see an ugly creepy crawly bug scurry across the pages of my Bible. I lifted my hand ready to smash bug guts everywhere, but in that split second I watched as Helen cupped her hands and let the bug crawl onto her hands. She carefully released the bug in the nearby grass.\n\nHelen, to me, embodied gentleness—reserved, quiet, shy, soft-spoken, introverted. When friends sought her out for counsel, her deep brown eyes would close slowly as her head tilted in a slow nod of understanding. Kind to all God’s creation, she did not squish bugs.\n\nHelen embodied everything I was not.\n\nBack then I equated “gentle” with “shy.” Verses like 1 Peter 3:4, “but let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God,” left me despairing, wondering how to willfully become shy.\n\nFurther study on the word “gentle,” however, yielded both unexpected relief and challenge.\n\nThe Greek word for gentleness, prautes, is defined as meekness, which means “strength under control” (Barclay). The image is one of a beautiful, strong stallion, trained under bit and bridle. The stallion retains all his tremendous strength, but now operates under the control of a master. Gentleness is not weakness; it is not a personality bent, a sentimental fondness or passive quiet. It is a fruit of the Spirit which enables a believer to place the will of God before her own.\n\nJesus, with strength enough to control the weather, describes Himself as gentle and humble in heart (Matthew 11:29). He subjects His great power to the will of God the Father, a model of the biblical gentleness that is precious in the sight of God. You and I can’t control the weather, but we do retain our personality, gifting and strengths when we come into relationship with God. Through the gift of the Holy Spirit, we are empowered to submit our strength to the greater strength and Kingdom purposes of our God.\n\nI still think my friend Helen is one of the gentlest people I’ve ever known, but now I better understand the “why” of her gentle spirit. Rather than shy, the fruit of gentleness calls me to be surrendered. Quiet or outgoing, bug-squisher or bug-saver, the key is found in the posture of our heart. A Christlike gentleness is not clutching and grabbing for control. It is the spirit of following Jesus with hands and heart open, humble yet strengthened in Him.\n\nFather, help us bear fruit that honors You by laying aside our will for yours. Amen.\n\nVivian Mabuni is an author and speaker, and a sushi, white Christmas lights, coffee-with-friends-lover.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Debbie Eaton\n\nThe alarm goes off at 6:30am and I lay in bed thinking about the day ahead. I have the best intentions—I will eat healthy, exercise, limit my time on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and email. I will be cheerful and present for my family, friends, co-workers, and keep my tongue in check. “I am in control” is the unsaid message exchanged between my head and heart.\n\nMy feet hit the floor and, in less than an hour, I have already spent too much time scrolling through social media, resulting in a rush to get breakfast on the table. Now feeling anxious and angry, I yell at everyone in the house for being late. The personal and work emails that arrived overnight overwhelm me, and the sight of dishes piled in the sink and clothes left on the floor exasperates me. Today’s exercise, I rationalize to myself, will be walking from the car to Starbucks and back again.\n\nMy good intentions have evaporated all too quickly, and I am ready to throw in the towel and surrender the white flag before it’s even time for lunch. The control I thought was mine seems lost. I am wiped out and done in with self-defeat. And with that, I have left an open door for the enemy to wreak havoc.\n\nA person without self-control is like a city with broken-down walls.\n\n– Proverbs 25:28, NLT\n\nI’m sure I’m not the only one reading these Scriptures today whose good intentions become muddled in the presence of daily stresses, desires and demands. The determination to exhibit self-control can deteriorate quickly in the reality of the day, leading us down a path of guilt and discouragement, fear and shame. But does biblical self-control simply mean the ability to do what I’m determined to do, and avoid what I’m determined not to do? Is it just about trying harder?\n\nScripture teaches that self-control is a fruit of the Spirit, not a fruit of our determination. As believers in Christ’s saving grace, we have the presence of the Holy Spirit in us, guarding our life which is now hidden in Christ. The Spirit is a sort of wall, protecting our mind, heart and soul. In His love and mercy, God rebuilds and redeems our broken pieces as we learn to abide in Him. We may not always exhibit self-control the way we want to or ought to, but His presence is here in us—Jesus promised us this!\n\nThe Holy Spirit in us is not subject to our desires, but rather He conforms our desires to Christ’s will. As we’ll read tomorrow in John 15, Jesus explains His relationship to His disciples as a vine into whom they are grafted. “Apart from me you can do nothing,” He says (John 15:5). When we are grafted into the Vine, we already have the power and authority to say “yes” or “no,” or just “not right now” because the God who lives in us has all power. Abiding in Christ’s power releases us from striving to muster up our own. In His presence we are free to move forward in grace and with courage, knowing that He is “our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble” (Psalm 46:1).\n\nI still wake up most days with a mental list of all the ways I’ll control my behavior, my words, my time and my disposition, but God is teaching me that true victory is not found in controlling myself—true freedom and victory are found in being led by God’s Spirit who dwells in me. Self-control comes when I relinquish ultimate control to Jesus, my Vine and my strength. When we find our identity in Him, the fruit will come in abundance.\n\nLord, may we experience fulfillment today, not because of what we determine to do or not do, but because of what we know you’re doing in us. Amen.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n",

I want to be all those things!\n\nWho doesn’t love joy and peace? Who couldn’t use more kindness and self-control?\n\nIt’s right to see this list and want it to be true of us—the fruit of the Spirit is good because God is good! The problem comes when we set out to bear fruit by being good, when we pretend fruit-bearing is simply a matter of our will instead of a result of our connection to Christ. The key lies in the name: the fruit of the Spirit. Not my fruit. Not your fruit. Not the fruit of She Reads Truth, or your favorite theologian, or even the Church! The fruit of the Spirit is borne of the Spirit. Period. The end.\n\nTo understand fruit-bearing in Gospel terms, there is no better resource than John Chapter 15. (Seriously – read the whole thing and then read it again! So good.) Jesus uses clear and practical imagery to explain the connection between Himself and His disciples:\n\n“I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in Me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without Me.”\n\n– John 15:5 HCSB\n\nLove, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control are not fruits we bear of our own sheer will and desire. We bear fruit when, and only when, we are grafted to the True Vine. Jesus Christ is our nourishment! His Holy Spirit in us is the fruit producer; we are simply the branches which have the privilege of displaying His fruit. Or, as I keep saying and threatening to put on a t-shirt, “We don’t bear it; we just wear it!” (I know. Thank me for that one later.)\n\nFriends, Jesus Christ comes to make us new. He comes to redeem the dead branches that we are and give us abundant life! Abiding in Him—resting, dwelling, remaining in Him— is the only source of our strength, our goodness, our fruit. Let’s press into the True Vine together today. Let’s be about the business of abiding in Jesus, and trust His Spirit to be about the business of bearing fruit in our lives.\n\nAs we wrap up this study, let’s take a moment to reflect and share:\n\nWhich fruit of the Spirit are you most tempted to produce on your own, apart from the Vine?\n\nHow has the Scripture you’ve read over the last 12 days changed the way you think of fruit-bearing? And abiding?\n\n——\n\n",

In fact, it is the start of every new beginning.\n\nOver the next 14 days, we will look at the life of Christ from His resurrection to His ascension. We will make our way from the empty tomb through the end of the four gospels, watching those incredible first encounters and listening in on life-changing conversations. Who did Jesus see? What did He do and say? How did the disciples respond when they saw their risen Lord, and what does it all mean for you and me?\n\nLet’s take a closer look at our Jesus, the one who died for our sins and rose from the grave, who lives so that we might also live.\n\n“Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!”\n\n– John 1:29b\n\n",

    "devo_title": "whom do you seek?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: John 20:11-18, Jeremiah 29:13\n\nYou know how it feels when you get to the part of your favorite movie where the main character finally has the epiphany you’ve been waiting for over an hour? Your shoulders tense and you hold your breath; you know what’s about to happen but watching it unfold still makes you lean in a little closer.\n\nThat’s how I feel about these eight verses from the gospel of John. I know the story. I know what Mary Magdalene will find when she looks inside the tomb. I know the identity of the man she supposes to be the gardener. Yet, each time I read the story, I exhale after the same word, every time:\n\n“Mary.”\n\nHe spoke her name. The Son of God, now raised from His own grave, appeared first to a formerly demon-possessed woman named Mary Magdalene (Luke 8:2).\n\nWhy her, do you suppose? Why did Jesus choose Mary Magdalene as the other character in this glorious, theater-worthy scene at the grave? We’re not given the answer, but my heart can’t help but think it is this:\n\nMary was a seeker. She sought after Jesus.\n\nShe saw the stone was rolled away, her Savior missing from the tomb – and she went inside looking for Him anyway.\n\nTwo angels in white greeted her, and a normal person would have run – but Mary went to them weeping, asking for her Lord.\n\nThen another face she did not recognize, perhaps due to her tears, asked why she was sad – and Mary didn’t even answer the question. She jumped right to the seeking.\n\n“Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” (v.15, emphasis mine)\n\nMary was seeking her Lord. She sought Him when He was living, and she sought Him after He died. She sought Him relentlessly, even through the pain and confusion of a freshly broken heart. She did not understand the “why” of what was happening, but she understood this: She needed to find Jesus.\n\nAnd He spoke her name.\n\nHe saw her, He knew her.\n\nShe called for Him and He called back to her.\n\nThings would be different between Mary and Jesus now. He was no longer her living Lord, He was her living, risen Lord. Everything had changed – for her, for the disciples, for the world –  and Jesus would leave them to ascend to the Father. I can imagine the love with which He told her she must let Him go (v. 17). But something tells me Mary did not stop seeking after she ran off to tell the others, “I have seen the Lord!” Something tells me she sought Him all the more.\n\nWill we?\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Debbie Eaton\n\npsst – Look for the next #SheSharesTruth assignment at the very bottom of the post! \n\nText: Matthew 28:16-20, Mark 16:14-20\n\nIt was an ordinary day and, as usual, I wandered into my local Starbucks to get my mocha. Behind me was a young man, and I decided to buy him whatever he wanted. At first he refused, but with some encouragement he said yes. It was what followed that took my breath away. I got an impression that I was to tell him that God saw him and loved him.\n\nIn total honestly, I doubted myself and almost moved on to my next activity. But in an instant moment, I turned to him and told him – God sees you, you are known and you are loved. His reaction was tearful and awe-struck as he told me he was desperately wondering if God had forgotten him. As we took a seat at a table, he told me he had been kicked out of his house, was living on pennies and had lost hope in God. We spoke for a few moments and prayed together.\n\nWhy do we live in the tension of worship and doubt that disables us to share the truth of God’s love? (See Matthew 28:17.)\n\nYou and I are commissioned – authorized by God – to “therefore go and make disciples” who will know Him and live for Him. This is a commandment from Jesus.\n\nWe can only do that if we are available and ready for the commissioned moments.\n\nIt starts with how pliable our heart is to choose worship, choose to deepen our spiritual growth and choose to hear the voice of God. Oswald Chambers says it like this: “Yet you cannot make disciples unless you are my disciple.”\n\nWe must be tenacious to align with God’s agenda and not ours. When we align with Him, then we can be freely available for the commissioned moments. This is not easy because our self-centered, busy, chaotic life can hurry us to miss those moments. Our doubt and fear of rejection can have us walk away and ignore when the moments present themselves.\n\nTherefore, we have a minute-by-minute choice to align with God, slow down, trust and believe that the great commission can be lived out at Target, the workplace, school drop-off, athletic fields, grocery stores, the park, a walk with a friend, mission trips to local communities and global nations, in our families, a private conversation on Facebook and, of course, at Starbucks.\n\nJesus said, “I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” (Matthew 28:20)\n\nWhat a promise and encouragement that Jesus is with us always! Now, in His power, let’s forge forward to embrace our commissioned moments and nurture discipleship.\n\nP.S.\n\nI ran into this young man again in Starbucks. His circumstances had not changed, but he lit up when he saw me. We sat down together over a cup of coffee, spoke about God and prayed together again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Hayley Morgan\n\nText: Luke 24:13-32\n\nThis is the first Easter of all time. It is the day when history pivoted and Love won out. But, there was still much sorrow because news of Jesus’s resurrection was slow to travel. When we jump into this piece of Scripture, we’re coming upon two friends (also disciples of Jesus) who are walking to the town of Emmaus, engaged in friendly conversation. They were heartbroken but expectant, waiting for news of certainty that Jesus had indeed risen from his tragic death.\n\nThey came upon a stranger who asked what they were talking about, and those two friends accepted this third man and resumed walking and talking. We are told this third man is in fact Jesus, but at the time the two had no idea. Bible commentator Matthew Henry makes note here that we should be encouraged by the fact that where two gather, Jesus joins (Matthew 18:19-20) and a threefold cord is strong and not easily broken (Ecclesiastes 4:12). We are seeing Scripture worked out in life here, two men in community and Jesus shows up.\n\nJesus not only shows up, but after confirming they are struggling to believe and hold hope, He recounts every Scripture prophesying His coming, dying, and rising. Right there on the road, He tells them just why they should hold out hope and believe.\n\nWhat an amazing experience these men had. They walked with Jesus, learned from Him, stayed with Him for the night, even broke bread with Him. They begged Him to stay longer before they even really knew it was Him.\n\nThe men didn’t yet recognize Him as their beloved Jesus, but later talk about their hearts burning when He was reminding them of the Truth (Luke 24:32). One even says that he had never before been so affected by a conversation.\n\nIs this how we are when we encounter Jesus? Are we encouraged that when we get together with other believers Jesus is also there? When we learn from God, do our hearts burn and are our lives changed?\n\nDo we continue down the road as a different person because we walk with Jesus?\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Luke 24:33-43\n\nHave you ever seen a ghost?\n\nI have, um, definitely not. We live in a very physical world. We, in a way that is different from the ancient and medieval world, think of the physical world as the only part of the world worth mentioning. I mean, how much would you judge me if I told you I had seen a ghost? I’m not saying it’s not possible, but I reckon you would make a mental note to take me less seriously in the future.\n\nI’m with Shakespeare’s Hamlet when he says, “There is more in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in your philosophy.” He means that even if I don’t understand everything with my fancy rational mind, I acknowledge that I am small and there is a spiritual world that I cannot fully comprehend.\n\nSo, when the disciples see Jesus and think: GHOST!, it reminds me how they felt the texture of the spiritual element of the world in a very different way than I do. The ancient mind was more closely tuned to the spiritual; they saw colors, and stars, and water as indicators of spiritual realities. We, instead, see colors as reflected light on the spectrum, stars as gassy balls, and water as H2O.\n\nAnyway, these guys – these spiritual guys who had seen miracles and walked with Jesus, these guys who Jesus had told He was coming back – they were “terrified” (verse 37). And remember that when The Lord appears to folks in the Bible, the first thing He says is often “Do not be afraid!” (Gen 15:1, Matt 14:27). We are simple and focused on the physical, and when humans are confronted with spiritual forces meeting the physical – it’s scary.\n\nJesus is where heaven and earth literally meet.  \n\nIt’s astonishing. It was more than the disciples could handle. It’s more than we can handle.  It’s true and it’s a mystery. Jesus is fully God and fully man. It blows my tiny mind.\n\nBut Jesus tenderly makes provisions for their terror and their doubt and invites them to touch Him and calm their fears. The awesome God-Man loves and cares for us.\n\nHe fully understands both the physical and the spiritual worlds. And He is our bridge and connection. It is a beautiful mystery.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Luke 24:44-49\n\nThe disciples had calmed down a bit by now. They’d eaten some dinner, addressed some doubts. Jesus even ate fish right in front of them so they could see His body was real; He was real.\n\nJesus was back. He’d been killed, He’d been buried, He was dead in a tomb three days, but now He was back. And there He sat, eating and drinking and very much alive.\n\nIt was time. This was the moment Jesus would lift the veil and reveal to them what He’d always known.\n\nHe sat back from his plate and began to speak. If I may paraphrase, it went something like this:\n\nI know the last week has been a little… intense. Me sitting here with all of you must seem completely nuts. But guys – THIS, this is what I’ve been telling you all along. Don’t you see? It’s all happened exactly as the scriptures said it would. The Messiah who would suffer and die and be raised in 3 days? It’s me. It’s always been me. \n\nAnd you are the ones who’ve seen it all. You’ve had a front row seat to everything that’s happened, and now you get to tell the world! You get to tell them about me, about repentance and forgiveness and grace. You get to tell them about Hope.You have the full message now, and I’m charging you – trusting you – to proclaim it.\n\nYou won’t be on your own. My Father said He would send you a Helper, and He will. Wait for Him. Don’t go it alone; that’s not the way it’s meant to be. \n\nSpreading this message is your responsibility, but it is still my Father’s work. Follow His lead.\n\nSister, you and I weren’t sitting around that table but that charge is for us, too – as are the privilege and the promise. The Jesus who spoke to His bewildered friends over plates of broiled fish is the same Jesus who calls to us wherever we are today. You and I are the ones who have seen it happen – hearts and lives restored and spiritual captives set free.\n\nYou and I have been given that same message of repentance and forgiveness to proclaim, that same Hope and that same Help. The charge is for us, too.\n\nWe may not have all our questions answered or our mysteries revealed.\n\nWe may even be a little freaked out by all we’ve seen and heard.\n\nBut we sit at the table with the One who knows how all the pieces fit. He always has.\n\n \n\n ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Hayley Morgan\n\nText: John 20:19-23\n\nGod breathed life into man in Genesis (Genesis 2:7). Without God who created us, we would have no life.\n\nSimilarly, Jesus breathed on his disciples and they received the gift of the Holy Spirit, which moves in us and gives us new life (John 6:63).\n\nIt’s this posture of being the created instead of the Creator that allows us to live for Christ. We can do nothing in our own strength; it is the Holy Spirit in us that works and achieves His means. Jesus knew that we would need Peace, and the Holy Spirit is peace. The Holy Spirit brings forth fruits that we could not bear on our own. They are not of flesh, but they are higher than that.\n\nThe fruits the Holy Spirit grows are love, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23). These things can’t be born out of our dead flesh, just like an oak tree can’t grow apples. But, when the Holy Spirit that Christ bestows in this passage dwells in a person, they have the very Spirit of God within them. When we say, “I no longer live but Christ lives in me” (Galatians 2:20), we are deferring to His glory and His power.\n\nIf we yield our flesh, His Holy Spirit will grow new fruit we could never have grown ourselves. This is truly a gift because, like salvation, these are not things we could conjure up on our own. A sinful heart does not seek to be good. A wandering heart cannot make itself faithful.\n\nWhat a gift to be transformed by the Holy Spirit. Jesus is so good to us.\n\n",

Jesus spoke her name and she believed. And then the two men on the road to Emmaus, their hearts burned within them as the Risen Christ Himself opened the Scriptures to them… and they believed. And now we find ourselves in the upper room, where Jesus sits with his disciples, and our beloved Doubting Thomas boldly proclaims:\n\n“Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.”\n\n(John 20:25, ESV)\n\nToday, in the midst of all of the narratives about those who believed and didn’t believe – those who only believed when they touched His hands or clung to His resurrected body, or handled His burial cloths – let’s ask ourselves this:\n\nWhy do WE believe that Christ was raised from the dead?\n\nWe have not seen. Or touched. Or kissed or clung or anything actually, genuinely tangible. We are the blessed ones to whom Christ refers in verse 29, “those who have not yet seen and yet have believed.”\n\nBut why? Why do we follow Christ?\n\nThere’s an old hymn – “He Lives” – that sings in a chorus of emotion:\n\nYou ask me how I know He lives?\n\nHe lives within my heart!\n\nI’ll be honest, and I hope I don’t offend. That’s just not enough for me. Maybe on a Sunday morning wearing my Easter hat and holding my pew hymnal, but not on a Tuesday night when my world is crashing down, or I’m drowning in doubt, or my head and heart are clouded with temptation.\n\nI’m going to need more than “He lives within my heart.” You, too?\n\nWell girls, I’ve sought counsel (I’m so thankful for my pastor!). I’ve sought the Lord. And I’ve assembled these thoughts which I hope will serve to reassure you in your own faith and draw you back to the place they drew me: Lord, I believe! Hallelujah!\n\nFactually, we have before us a host of recorded eyewitness accounts to the resurrection, the empty tomb, and even Christ’s burial clothes. Facts are good, and helpful, so let’s not forget them.\n\nSecond, we have the disciples’ response. Would these men have committed their lives and ultimately died for a Savior who didn’t raise from the dead himself? The commitment of those closest to Jesus may be the most powerful human evidence to the resurrection. It is impossible to conceive of them dying for something they know was a fraud.\n\nWe have also been given a host of textual evidences of Old and New Testament promises (death + resurrection and otherwise) fulfilled. The Word of God is trustworthy.\n\nWe have the growth of the capital-C Church.\n\nWe have lives changed and the truth that the Gospel is THE story that makes sense of all redemption stories.\n\nAnd the truth is? Christ did not raise from the dead and leave us alone to figure it out. He left His Spirit. And all that God ever needed to say or will need to say has already been said in His Word, and that same Holy Spirit that Jesus literally breathed on the disciples, is with us – literally with us – now to illuminate and reveal those words for us.\n\nYou ask me how I know He lives?\n\nIt’s more than a feeling or an emotion. It’s more than factual bullet points. And it absolutely requires faith. It’s a mystery and yet it’s clear as day.\n\n“To say, ‘I hope so, I trust so’, is comfortable; and there are thousands in the fold of Jesus who hardly ever get much further. But to reach the essence of consolation you must say, ‘I know’. Ifs, buts and perhapses, are sure murderers of peace and comfort… but if I know that Jesus lives for me, then darkness is not dark: even the night is light about me.”\n\n– C.H. Spurgeon, Morning and Evening\n\n",

When have you experienced a commissioned moment and how did you witness God’s supernatural power at work? Pray and ask God to present a commissioned moment, then let’s share our stories and encourage one another.\n\nWill you share your story with us today, dear Sisters? Big or small, glamorous or decidedly not — we want to hear how God is teaching you to live out your calling to share the gospel with your words and actions.\n\nHere’s the scoop on how to participate:\n\n\n\nWrite your devotional/reflections/response to the above question on “commissioned moments” on your personal blog. (Or on Instagram or Facebook! with the hashtags #SheSharesTruth and #SheReadsTruth; or even write the comments section here.)\n\nLink to this post so your readers can know about the #SheSharesTruth experiment too.\n\nShare the link to your post/Facebook update/Instagram below in the LinkyTool below.\n\nVisit each other’s links – at least one or two (maybe the two people who linked up before you?). Comment there – tell them you see them and hear them!\n\n**Please share your heart, sisters. Our desire is not for this to be a time of comparison or sizing up writing abilities or spiritual maturity. Eloquence and insight are lovely, but we know that is not the thing our God calls us to. So, let’s not call each other to that either. Sister, if you feel ill-equipped – GOOD! If you feel like you have so much to learn – GREAT. SO DO WE! Every single time we sit down to write. And if we don’t, are hearts are not in the right place. Let this be a safe place to learn and share and love each other WELL.\n\n\n\nIf you’re new to the #SheSharesTruth link up, you can read more about the heart behind it here.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: John 21:1-14\n\n“Christ is often nearer to us than we think he is.”\n\n– Matthew Henry\n\nThis story of Jesus filling the apostles’ net with fish feels like one of those “normal” miracles (is there such a thing?) that belongs in the thick of Christ’s ministry, back when He was healing the sick and turning water into wine and feeding the five thousand. Instead, we find it here, wedged between the ultimate miracles of His glorious resurrection and magnificent ascension.\n\nWeren’t there more glamorous encounters to tell? Why not a sermon on Most Important Things before Jesus returned to the Father? This story gives us no quotable lines from the Savior of Man – we get very few words from Him at all, actually. Instead, He reveals Himself by what He does. He gives. \n\nHe gives Himself. The disciples did not see Him, but He saw them. He was with them, even when they did not know it, like the Helper who would be with them in spirit, always (Matthew 28:20).\n\nHe gives loving care. He calls them “children” and inquires about their work, as a loving Father would. He is concerned with their concerns, their everyday, their frustrations and their failures as much as their success.\n\nHe gives wisdom. The disciples must have been frustrated and tired as the sun rose on that boat filled with no fish. Their efforts had amounted to nothing. Jesus gave them guidance. He gave them fish. Only with Him was their work fruitful.\n\nHe gives sustenance. The fish were already swimming in the lake that day. The breakfast was already cooking on the coals when they reached the shore. The initiative to provide was the Lord’s, not theirs.\n\nHe gives abundantly. 153 fish – John gives us the exact number. 153 fish in a net that did not break. These minor details are not so minor to folks who fish for a living. His provision was specific and extravagant.\n\nHe gives apart from merit. All of this He gave without their asking, without their making a case for what was needed or a promise to be better – better fishermen, better followers, better people.\n\nThe provision was based on grace.\n\nIt was based on love and mercy.\n\nIt was based on the very character of Christ, the risen Savior.\n\nHe provided in such way that “they knew it was the Lord” (v.12).\n\nHe would leave them soon and there would be much work to do. But in this encounter on the lakeshore, Jesus illustrates that they would not be alone. He would be closer than they think.\n\nLook around your life. Where do you see the risen Christ today? What needs has He fulfilled that you did not anticipate, did not plan for, did not even know to ask for? Where do you see the fingerprints of His grace and lovingkindness? Sister, He is revealing Himself to you even now, in ways only you can recognize.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "do you love me?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: John 21:15-19\n\nI love theatre, and when I studied this passage I noticed that it reads like a scene from a play.\n\nJesus: Simon, do you love me?\n\nSimon: Yes.\n\nJesus: Feed my lambs. Do you love me?\n\nSimon: Yes, you know it.\n\nJesus: Tend my sheep. Do you love me?\n\n(Peter is sad)\n\nPeter: You know all things, you know I love you.\n\nJesus: Feed my sheep.\n\nWhen I look at it this way, I’m forced to think about the relationship between these two men and the emotional progression of that moment together.\n\nThis restoration of Peter is incredibly tender and personal. Jesus confronts Peter about his sin, and here He seems to be alluding to Peter’s three-time denial on the night before the crucifixion. Jesus doesn’t just skip over sin – He addresses it. This is an uncomfortable moment for Peter. By the second “Do you love me?” Peter starts to really try to reassure Jesus. Peter wants to defend himself to Christ and he is hurt to see that Christ doubts his love.\n\nBut this moment of confrontation and confusion and hurt is Good, because He is Good.\n\nJesus came to restore us, and to restore us fully. He doesn’t want us to hold on to our pet sins and betrayals, but to surrender everything to Him.\n\nIn this beautiful and awkward moment, Jesus firmly guides Peter back to repentance and obedience.\n\nWhen Christ comes to us, He comes for one thing: Christ comes to make us new. He makes us new for His glory! Even in our fearful hesitancy, He is tenderly but irresistibly working to make us what He has called us to be, and He calls us once more, saying, “Follow me.”\n\n \n\n",

Because of this, the people responded by worshiping in joy. Then, they went back to their homes and blessed God continually.\n\nThis should be our posture of praise. Jesus has blessed us with salvation, and our response ought to be worship. We should be joyfully grateful and in awe, simply because of the work Jesus completed on the cross. Then, we should go back to our regular life and bless God with it. It really is that simple.\n\nThere will be dark days, days when joy feels far away. But, worship is not always sunny and it doesn’t always sound like Contemporary Christian radio. The broken can be holy because it is redeemed. Nothing is wasted or left to rubble in God’s economy, and just knowing that can let in a sliver of light.\n\nIn this miraculous and unlikely event, Jesus’s ascension, we are reminded again that God does not waste death. He makes all things new and works all things together for our good.\n\nThat is worthy of joyful worship, indeed.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nI stood on the street corner this time last year, at the intersection of 5th and Main—head bowed, backpack on, tears streaming down my face.\n\nMinutes earlier I was walking from my car to my favorite coffee shop with plans for a productive Wednesday morning, when I noticed two priests up ahead of me (a site which would have been normal in my Chicago days, but was a first for me in little Franklin, Tennessee). The priests were from the Episcopal church about a block away. One was holding a small bowl of ashes from the burnt palms of the previous year’s Palm Sunday service, and the other held a small stack of papers in his hands. I greeted them and they greeted me, and they explained why they were there:\n\n“We know not everyone can make it to an early morning Ash Wednesday service, so we’re meeting them here, in the middle of their lives, because we believe that’s exactly where Jesus meets us.”\n\nThey asked me if they could pray for me. Yes, please do.\n\nOne priest gave me one of his papers and I followed along with an Ash Wednesday prayer on the page as he prayed it over me:\n\nAlmighty and everlasting God, you hate nothing you have made and forgive the sins of all who are penitent: Create and make in us new and contrite hearts, that we, worthily lamenting our sins and acknowledging our wickedness, may obtain of you, the God of all mercy, perfect remission and forgiveness; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.\n\nWe exchanged a few quiet words, then with his thumb he solemnly smudged an ashen cross on my forehead, saying, “Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.”\n\nI was stopped in my tracks. Tears flowed while traffic carried on in the background, and I stood in stillness with my God and wept for the sins that separated me from Christ.\n\nAt the age of 31, it was the first time I’d observed Ash Wednesday in this traditionally Roman Catholic way. What had once seemed ritualistic to this protestant girl became a vehicle the Holy Spirit used to bring me to repent and believe anew.\n\nThis is Lent. It’s a time to stop—wherever we’re going and whatever we’re coming from. Whether we’ve been anticipating this season since Christmas, or it’s stopping us cold on our way to where we think we need to be—here we are.\n\nLent is a pause button. It is a quiet unlike any other time of year. Lent is a season to close our eyes as the busy world buzzes around us, to consider those things we’d much rather forget: our sin and our humanity. We came from dust, and to dust we will return.\n\nHave you ever heard the phrase “suppressing alleluia”? I hadn’t until just this year. (See? We get to learn new things, even as adults!) It was a practice introduced somewhere around the 7th or 8th century where congregants would sing the liturgical “Alleluia” loudly on the day before Ash Wednesday, then put the joyful word aside until Easter. The suppression of “Alleluia” was thought to increase the anticipation of Easter Sunday and the excitement of proclaiming Christ’s resurrection from the dead. It’s another one of those rituals, like ashen crosses on our foreheads, that feels like a tangible act of an inward posture.\n\nLet’s be honest: rituals are attractive. We are people who love visuals and search for tangible acts that allow us to experience God. But what these rituals are not is measurable. Bearing ashes or avoiding words will not purge us of our sins. These acts alone will not draw us nearer to God. But oftentimes Church traditions—when we understand their origin and the intent behind them—can serve as tools to remind us of the very real reality of the Gospel in our lives.\n\nWhether you carry the ashen cross on your forehead or not, know that Ash Wednesday is for remembering our sin and humanity—for reflecting on our fallen state and our gaping need for a Savior. Let today stop you in your tracks to “lament and acknowledge your wickedness”, knowing that the King of Alleluias has already done all that needs to be done to grant you “perfect remission and forgiveness.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Joel 2:12-27, Jeremiah 24:4-7\n\n“Lord, even my repentance is broken. Help me.”\n\nThose are the words I scrawled in my notebook this morning as I tried desperately to lay my heart bare before God, frustrated that the process did not make me “feel” better. I am a sinner, and I know this. He is the one true God, and I know that, too. The lines of communication were open and I was trying to get there emotionally—wherever “there” is—but the warm fuzzies just weren’t coming.\n\nDo you ever have these moments where you fear you’ve forgotten how to pray—where you worry you’re not doing this whole “repent and believe” thing the right way?\n\nI went back to Scripture—to the passages we’re reading together today—and looked for the words “turn” and “return.” Maybe the answer was there—maybe I could learn how to come to Jesus all over again.\n\nI found the first “return” in Jeremiah 24:7, when God says of His people, “I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am Yahweh. They will be My people, and I will be their God because they will return to Me with all their heart.” Then in Joel 2:12, God says through the prophet, “turn to me with all your heart” and again just one verse later—“return to the Lord your God” (HCSB).\n\nAnd that was all.\n\nMuch to my dismay, the call to return to God is not written alongside a long list of to-do’s, an attainable checklist so I can feel sure I’m returning correctly. No, there is just one qualification—to return with all my heart. Evidently the cleaned up, feel-good part of my heart is not all God is looking for. He doesn’t want only the parts of my heart I’m willing to let others see—He wants the whole messy, confused, narcissistic, achy thing.\n\nSo, to recap: You and I and our whole unholy selves are called to turn fully, openly, and sans-covering to the holy, almighty God of all the universe.\n\n[Insert deep breath here.]\n\nIt’s no wonder we try to come to Him with layers of lies and pride and every other self-preservation instinct intact. It makes sense, right? Except it doesn’t… because Jesus.\n\nThe cross of Jesus is the path by which we return to our holy, gracious God. We need not fashion our own defense or disguise to shield our brokenness from His eyes—the blood of Jesus is our covering.\n\nOur actions do not give us the right to return. Our emotions do not grant us access to God. We return because—and only because—Jesus Christ goes before us, His cross as our banner and His grace as our plea.\n\nSisters, when you doubt that your whole, achy self is welcome in the presence of our God, look to the Cross.\n\nWhen you fear your return is lacking, that your repentance itself falls short, look to the Cross.\n\nThe Cross of Jesus is our only way to the Father—not just the first time, but every time.\n\nHis cross dispels each doubt;\n\nI bury in His tomb\n\nEach thought of unbelief and fear,\n\nEach lingering shade of gloom.\n\nI praise the God of grace;\n\nI trust His truth and might;\n\nHe calls me His, I call Him mine.\n\nMy God, my joy and light.\n\nfrom “Not What My Hands Have Done”\n\nHoratius Bonar, 1861\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Isaiah 43:16-21, 2 Corinthians 5:1-21\n\nI keep seeing everyone else’s adorable pictures on Instagram of their kids and their friends playing in the snow. And even though I really have no business hauling my pregnant self out to walk on ice, I took my kids sledding this morning. And it was the worst! How do you guys do it? We were crying and falling down and fighting—by the time we left, I was done with winter. (But seriously, how do you guys do it?)\n\nI know why my kids fight and cry, and why I curse the seasons. We are sinners. On our own, we are diametrically opposed to the way of Christ and when given the chance to be selfish or selfless, we choose selfish every time.\n\nHonestly, it would be nice to skip over the hard parts of life: these cold, wintry seasons of hurt, anger, or loss. I just want to hide under my blankets and shut out the ugly and difficult parts of life. I don’t want to fight with the people I’m supposed to love!\n\nBut I’m so afraid that God uses bitter, icy times to reconcile us to Him. I’m scared that I have to go through the winter of the soul so I can enjoy the springtime of the soul.\n\nWhen I peek out from under the covers, I know the truth. I know I have to give up my own will, repent, and be reconciled to God, or I’ll never see springtime. I have to do more than hide and wait for winter to end; I have to allow God to change my heart.\n\nDuring the season of Lent, we try to give things up to train our raw fingers to let go of old ways. But to reconcile with God and to breathe in the springtime, we have to do more than just let go. We have to replace our icy vices with the good, warm things of God.\n\nI’m forever stuck in the winter of sin until I let go of myself and receive the good things of God. Christ is the best gift of God—He is worth more than anything we could ever give up.\n\nWe don’t make this happen. We just cry out for help, and our Savior thaws our bitter hearts. I don’t understand how it happens. But I believe that He is our only hope to free us from our sin.\n\nSpringtime is coming! Christ Himself is a real answer to the cold ache of our souls. It’s not an easy answer, but He is the answer that actually addresses the heart of my need. He is the relieving thaw of spring.\n\nThis lenten season, let’s do more than suspend our vices—let’s run to Christ. Let’s be brave, come out of hiding, and be reconciled to Him.\n\n“Yet whatever else it may be, Lent should never be morose – an annual ordeal during which we begrudgingly forgo a handful of pleasures. Instead, we ought to approach Lent as an opportunity, not a requirement. After all, it is meant to be the church’s springtime, a time when, out of the darkness of sin’s winter, a repentant, empowered people emerges.”\n\n– from Bread and Wine: Readings for Lent and Easter\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Debbie Eaton\n\nText: Mark 2:13-17, Matthew 4:1-11\n\nRecently, I was on my way to Palm Desert to speak. I struggle with anxiety when driving alone, and I was not looking forward to the drive. The abyss of grey asphalt, cement walls, and red taillights of stop-and-go traffic unsettle me, and I knew once I made it through that traffic the desolate, dry, and brown desert would surround me for miles.\n\nI get nervous to be alone. The stillness tempts me with voices that say I am not a good enough wife, mother, friend, leader.  I am haunted by the “what ifs” and  “should haves” and silence.\n\nI was driving through that desert, sensing the welling of anxious thoughts, when God came close and met me. As He gently shifted my focus off my self-imposed discouragement and onto His promises of acceptance, forgiveness, and love, the desert transformed before my eyes. The brown became a brilliant bronze, the blue sky glistening against the horizon. The cactus and Joshua trees reminded me that life emerges out of barren land, and the wind whipping up dust prompted me to know the Holy Spirit comforts and transforms our thoughts. The desolate desert came alive when God came close.\n\nThe Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.\n\n– Psalm 145:18\n\nLevi’s anxious view of the world changed the day Jesus called him to follow. Sinner, come as you are—broken, weary, shamed, and rejected. I see you, accept you, and will call you my friend. Come dine with me. What a beautiful invitation. I wonder if Levi’s world went from black and white to vibrant color that day.\n\nJesus extends an invitation to come close at any time and to follow Him, no matter our condition. He calls us to come close minute by minute, every day. He heals, He redeems, He saves, He invites, He accepts – He changes us and our perspective, which draws us into greater understanding that He cares about every detail of our life.\n\nThere will be desert days. Even Jesus endured seasons in the wilderness. In those seasons, He fasted and drew close to His heavenly Father. His physical weakness did not succumb to the Tempter’s plan because His Father nourished Him. The enemy has nothing of worth to offer a soul filled with the truth of God’s Word. Amen!\n\nFriend, the Word of God has the same power in your wilderness. Come close and fast with Jesus, cling to Him and His cross when the Tempter tries to steal your true identity. Like Levi who found his true identity in Christ, you are also invited, chosen, known, and loved—just as you are. As you come close to Jesus, the world around you will transform and become more beautiful and radiant because you are changed.\n\n\n\n",

I hope that’s okay to say out loud, because it’s true. We are learning about this beautiful book—the living Word of God—alongside you, opening it up each day and praying to the God who made us. We come to the Bible knowing and believing that the Holy Spirit has been given to us as our Helper, that He has been promised to us by the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Savior. This is who we are—like you, we are daughters of the King. We come empty-handed, expecting Him to give us all we need.\n\nIn preparing for this reading plan that spans the season of Lent (we like to call it “lententide” because it’s such a pretty word), we went to folks who know more than us for help. We called on pastors and friends, we read books and researched themes. It is part of our “job” and we LOVE it. So much. One resource we consulted was a book on the liturgical calendar called Eternity Today, and the author said this about Lent:\n\n“What can be lost in this season is that, though believers indeed ‘fast and pray,’ they often do this not more aware of the love of God, but assuming that they need to win God’s favor…\n\n“Lent is unique in the liturgical year because the members of the church conscientiously turn from excesses not to remind God of humanity, but to remind themselves of the constancy of God’s love.”\n\nI’m a sucker for all things old and liturgical. I love corporate readings in church services, sacraments and hymnals. I love studying Lent and just about anything else that reminds me I’m part of a body of believers who have been worshipping our God for hundreds and hundreds of years. But do I “do” Lent as obligation or to be a part of a centuries-old ritual? Do I do Lent to win God’s favor? I would never say so… but turning this quote and these Scriptures over in my heart and mind, I’m not so sure.\n\nIf I’m completely honest, I have to admit that I hope—or maybe even believe—my small sacrifices make God love me a little bit more. I hope they’ll erase some of those selfish things I did that I wish I could take back. I hope they’ll cover over my neglect of those in need, my lack of compassion for the hardships of others. If I’m honest, I think Lent buys me an ounce of forgiveness and favor in the eyes of God.\n\nHere’s the rub: this belief is not just a simple misunderstanding. It is itself a sinful pride that devalues the very blood of Christ. He has purchased my pardon! He is the righteousness that covers my sin! He is the One who has earned God’s favor, and He is the reason that favor is lavished on me.\n\nOur need for Jesus is deep, but His love for us is deeper. His love for us is constant, whatever season and state we’re in. He redeems us and refines us because of this great love, not because of what we do.\n\nWe come to Christ with empty buckets — whether we admit it or not. So let’s not bring our self improvements and call them sacrifices. Let’s don’t use our efforts as currency to buy the free grace we’ve been given.\n\nLet’s simply come to the cross of Christ — again, today.\n\nLet’s come empty. He will fill us.\n\n\n\n \n\n",

Really, I think we’d be great friends.\n\nMeeting new people is such fanfare to some. There are mnemonic devices for remembering names, online guides to small talk, and the worst—the “get to know you” games.\n\nIcebreakers, often in the form of “the name game” or “two truths and a lie,” are usually well-intentioned attempts to make a group of strangers more comfortable with one another. They’re also my cue to run to the nearest exit.\n\nIt’s not because I’m shy—oh, goodness, no!-—it’s just that having 10 seconds to determine my forever impression on a bunch of people I’ve never met isn’t my definition of fun.\n\nMaybe it’s because the nicknames I’ve walked away with from these games have stayed with me longer than I’d hoped, or just because I’ve spent years talking myself out of the things I said in a moment of sheer panic (“Yes, I know I said I love to kayak, but in reality I’ve never been in one and I just couldn’t think of another word that began with the letter K”).\n\nMore likely, it’s because I want to control how the world sees me. I spend time bartering for my worth through the lens of another, and usually walk away counting my losses.\n\nWhile reading about the hypocrites in Matthew 6, I begin doing the same thing.\n\nNo, Lord. I’m not like that.\n\nAnd He gently pushes me to the end of the chapter, where Jesus teaches about worry, something that initially seems unrelated.\n\nBut when I can’t write others’ opinions of me, I get sweaty.\n\nWhen I try to manipulate approval, I become restless.\n\nAnd when I hustle to cover up my wrongs, I’m the most anxious girl in the room.\n\nIn that familiar, worried place kept secret by my shame, I find myself standing with the hypocrites as Jesus questions us—Why are you anxious, O you of little faith?\n\nI want to point to the part of my name tag that says “Christian” in bold letters. Of course I have faith!\n\nHe reminds me to soften my strife and silence my sales pitch. Am I afraid the Christian life will go unnoticed, or am I worried I won’t get credit for being a part of it?\n\nIf we really looked to see what’s behind and before our random acts of kindness, behind and before our words formed in prayer, behind and before our songs sung in worship—would there be a void?\n\nThose actions have a name and it’s not ours.\n\nMay I be willing to trade a whisper of my name for a shout of His.\n\nMay I stop trying to be the “bigger person” and start seeking the All Sufficient.\n\nMay I replace my performance with His presence.\n\nMay we come quietly for the Almighty to sound.\n\n“Father, you know us in secret, and you know all our secret places.\n\nWhat we do to benefit your kingdom will not be lost if it is not seen by others,\n\nfor you see and you reward according to your grace and mercy.\n\nStrengthen us to do good works, visibly or invisibly, always in your name.”\n\n– GK Chesterton\n\nKaitlin Wernet is a Carolina girl who now plants her feet in Tennessee as the Community Coordinator for She Reads Truth.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Diana Stone\n\nText: Isaiah 58:1-14\n\nLast year was my first time observing Lent, a season I’d known next to nothing about prior to that. I was caught up in the whirlwind of its beauty, especially online. It seemed everyone was giving up something they leaned on in day to day life. Coffee and chocolate were especially mourned, but I decided that without coffee I may not make it through Lent at all.\n\nBeautiful journals, study guides, books, and prints filled my social media. I was blown away by the fervor for this time in the life of the Church, yet in each purchase and choice that I made, something felt wrong.\n\nWhy did Lent seem like it was all about me?\n\nMaybe you’re feeling the same things this year. Maybe you decided not to do anything because your ideas felt shallow compared to the Easter story we’re preparing for. Maybe, like me, your heart needs to be reminded that this season is not about our holy acts or intentions, but the love and mercy of our Holy God.\n\nPart of walking deeper in our journey with Christ is learning to turn our inward focus outward—taking our gaze off ourselves and onto Christ, and onto others for the sake of Christ. Let’s take a moment today to explore what “giving up something for Lent” might look like in light of God’s Word and the “chosen fast” He calls us to in Isaiah 58.\n\nWhat if we thought about:\n\nGiving up evil practices (Judges 2:19).\n\nGiving up violence and oppression (Ezekiel 45:9).\n\nGiving up religious compromise (Daniel 3:28).\n\nGiving up possessions (Luke 14:33).\n\nGiving up words that tear others down (Ephesians 4:29).\n\nI want to encourage you to read these Scriptures—and others!— and listen to the Holy Spirit. Where is He nudging your heart this Lent season and beyond—to shift your gaze outward onto Christ and His Church?\n\nWould you give up your Instagram feed being solely dedicated to your life to include causes that burden your heart? Would you give up a grudge or ill-thoughts toward a friend and devote time to praying for her each day? Would you be willing to give up complacency and take a stand for your faith in a place you may not be comfortable, whether online or off, for the sake of the lost and the glory of God? Where can you extend God’s mercy to others right here where He has placed you?\n\nWhatever this Lent season looks like for you—from devoting time to writing in a journal, to reading your children a Bible story each night—let’s allow the season to reflect the heart of the Father, the reason we prepare our souls for the sacrifice and celebration to come. We can never come close to what Jesus gave up for us, but we can draw ourselves close to Him.\n\nIsn’t the fast I choose:\n\nTo break the chains of wickedness,\n\nto untie the ropes of the yoke,\n\nto set the oppressed free,\n\nand to tear off every yoke?\n\nIs it not to share your bread with the hungry,\n\nto bring the poor and homeless into your house,\n\nto clothe the naked when you see him,\n\nand not to ignore your own flesh and blood?\n\nThen your light will appear like the dawn,\n\nand your recovery will come quickly.\n\nYour righteousness will go before you,\n\nand the Lord’s glory will be your rear guard.\n\nAt that time, when you call, the Lord will answer;\n\nwhen you cry out, He will say, ‘Here I am.’\n\n– Isaiah 58:6-9a, HCSB\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Romans 12:1-2, John 4:24, Psalm 95:1-11\n\nAs I sit down to write to you girls today, I have a confession. As I crack my knuckles, take a swig of coffee, and strap on my noise cancelling headphones, I have to tell you: this is attempt #14 at focusing long enough to appropriately meditate on and respond to these rich and right scriptures for today’s devotional. Talk about last minute: I am literally writing this 10 hours before it is intended to go live on the site.\n\nMy focus is off and my distractions number in the hundreds right now, it seems. And I need to repent.\n\nOur family is preparing for a cross-town move at the end of next week and every utility company in the phone book requires applications and signatures and fees and phone calls. I’m getting texts from our builder asking “have you selected hooks for the mudroom yet?” and “it looks like you accidentally had some things delivered to a house that doesn’t belong to you yet.” I woke up no less than 4 times last night, working through details and decisions and checklists. (True story: two nights ago I actually dreamed I was taking a nap! That’s how exhausting these weeks have been—even in my sleep, I need more sleep.)\n\nWhen I woke this morning, my thoughts immediately went to troubleshooting furniture arrangements. My waking (and sleeping) hours have been heavily focused on a to-do list that is all-consuming.\n\nNow, there’s nothing innately wrong with a good to-do list—I’m not sure how I’d get anything done without them. But, I know the difference in my heart between managing tasks and throwing my mind, body, and spirit into something—and I know I’ve been fixing my whole heart on something that won’t last.\n\nHave you read today’s scriptures yet? I have to tell you, Romans 12:1-2 is sure proof in my life that God’s Word is “sharper than any two-edged sword… discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart” (Hebrews 4:12). Once I finally sat my bottom in my desk chair to study and pray today, I found myself reading it over and over again, checking it in various translations. And I repented for my heart that is too often “conformed” and not nearly enough “transformed.”\n\nI loved what I found in the Message translation:\n\n“So here’s what I want you to do, God helping you: Take your everyday, ordinary life—your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life—and place it before God as an offering. Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him. Don’t become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking. Instead, fix your attention on God. You’ll be changed from the inside out. Readily recognize what he wants from you, and quickly respond to it. Unlike the culture around you, always dragging you down to its level of immaturity, God brings the best out of you, develops well-formed maturity in you.”\n\nI confess my attention has been fixed elsewhere, and I think I’ve been missing a lot of God-cues and opportunities to love His people well. Not because graceless guilt tells me so, but because the Holy Spirit has been faithfully convicting me of this for days. It’s between Him and me. I only share this with you today because I think I’m not alone, and I want you to know that you’re not alone either.\n\nIf you find yourself so wrapped up in a project or life event that things of eternal significance are cast by the wayside, sit still a moment. Fix your attention on the eternal Savior. If you are having a hard time “readily recognizing what He wants from you”, return to Him in prayer. Let Him change you from the inside out. Our heavenly Father is full of grace and mercy, faithful to forgive and redeem—faithful to transform our too-easily-conformed hearts.\n\nAnd then comes my favorite part. We worship! We respond to the Creator and Redeemer with thanksgiving and adoration!\n\nWe confess and repent.\n\nHe forgives and transforms us.\n\nAnd we worship!\n\nWhether my eyes were fixed on Jesus this week or on boxes that need to be packed, whether my attention is on His unending grace or my need for uninterrupted internet service, He is faithfully transforming me from an earth-bolted girl to a woman with a renewed mind and spirit. And whatever your life looks like this week, He is doing the same in you. For that, let us say with the Psalmist, “Come, let us worship and bow down!”\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Acts 3:19-21, Romans 2:3-4, Lamentations 1:16, 2 Corinthians 7:5-12\n\nRepent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out,\n\nthat times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord…\n\n– Acts 3:19-20a, ESV\n\n“It is not repentance that saves me; \n\nrepentance is the sign that I realize what God has done in Christ Jesus.”  \n\n– Oswald Chambers\n\nI’m an avoider. I avoid uncomfortable topics and decisions. I avoid unfortunate feelings and situations. I avoid watching the news when I can get away with it, and I’ve been known to avoid eye contact with the homeless vendor selling newspapers on the corner.\n\nI avoid grief and suffering because I don’t want to experience grief and I don’t want to experience suffering. I can’t solve them, can’t explain them away—I can only enter in, and most times I’d rather not. The only way to get to the other side of these unavoidable mountains is to walk through them—over, under, and around are not options.\n\nI avoid acknowledging my sin for the same reason. It’s uncomfortable, it’s painful, it’s something I can’t solve or explain away. I fall deathly short, just like we all do (Romans 3:23, 6:23). The darkness I am capable of is shocking to the senses. Who wants to admit such a thing? Like it’s the nightly news, I look away and wait for it to disappear. If I don’t see it, it must not exist.\n\nYou and I might be tempted to skip over this next book of the Bible we’ll read together for these same reasons. Some of the language in Lamentations is uncomfortable, the images are upsetting—it puts a magnifying glass up to a reality we’d rather ignore. Written in response to the capture and destruction of Jerusalem, the book of Lamentations is exactly what its name implies—it is a book of 5 poems, or songs, of lament. It is a book dedicated to mourning, weeping, and crying out to God. Some historians believe it may have even been used for worship within the actual ruins of the destroyed temple.\n\nOriginally named for the Hebrew word for “Alas!” or “How?”, Lamentations reads like an unedited exercise in how many ways a person can describe destruction, devastation, and despair. But the writer’s words don’t just apply to Jerusalem—they are a picture of our life without Christ. No comforter, no hope, no life—only death. Lamentations provides a revolting visual of the destruction our sin brings.  \n\nAcknowledging sin and its consequences is a difficult, achy, and emotionally invasive procedure. But a beautiful thing happens when we take that hard road through the mountain: we do not travel alone. Jesus is with us as God’s Word convicts our hearts. Jesus is with us as the Holy Spirit reveals our desperate need. Jesus is with us as our knees buckle at the devastation around us and the devastation within us. He is by our side to administer the salve of grace the moment each sin-wound is revealed.\n\nSomewhere in the thick of this ongoing heart surgery we begin to understand: only in seeing the depth of our sin can we see the unmatched grace and glory of the Cross.\n\nThink back to that image of God’s people standing among the temple ruins, singing out painful poems of lament. The holy city—their lives, their families, their futures—destroyed. Imagine them there in the wreckage, crying out to God asking all the appropriate questions. Why, Lord? Where are you, Lord? How long, O Lord? The first two chapters build like a musical crescendo, leading up to the climax placed purposefully, meaningfully in the center chapter of the book:\n\nBut this I call to mind,\n\nand therefore I have hope:\n\nThe steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;\n\nhis mercies never come to an end;\n\nthey are new every morning;\n\ngreat is your faithfulness.\n\n“The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,\n\n“therefore I will hope in him.”\n\n– Lamentations 3:21-24, ESV\n\nStanding there in the rubble, they worshiped. They repented. They claimed what they knew to be true — God is faithful, even here and even now.\n\nYou and I stand in the midst of wreckage today—broken churches, broken families, broken bodies, broken hopes. The consequences of sin are ugly and painful, and it hurts to look full at the darkness. We grieve our sinful state with honest questions and hot tears and loud lamenting—but this is the kind of godly grief that causes the apostle Paul to rejoice! Not because grief is painless or petty—it is anything but—but because godly grief leads to repentance (2 Cor. 7:9-10).\n\nFriends, we venture into the coming two weeks ready but not ready to face the sin in and among us. We take a somber step forward knowing only a bit of what is to come. But we walk ahead nonetheless because our Savior goes with us. Let us look on our sin, and let us look long at the Cross of Christ. Look to the One who does not avoid our suffering but enters in, who does not despise our brokenness but redeems it.\n\nMay our tears of grief lead us to repentance, and may we receive refreshment for our souls. Amen.\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Lamentations 1:1-11, Psalm 51:1-6, Psalm 32:1-11\n\nLast week I saw my husband and my sister give me the same exasperated look. I knew I was driving both of them crazy. I don’t listen and I push for my own way. I know it. But instead of sticking around to hear it in so many words, I hid in my office seeking the comfort of Samoas and Miles Davis.\n\nI’m definitely spending my days looking for comfort: warm coffee, me time, a massage, a pedicure, even a hot bath. Our modern response to hard times is to look for physical comfort. If my soul is restless, I’m looking for my down comforter and Girl Scout cookies and sparkling grape juice.\n\nI know that a bubble bath isn’t going to wash my soul, but aren’t you tempted to do the same thing? I want to dip my chin in lavender bubbles and forget that the only way to be truly clean is through repentance. Psalm 32 says that blessedness is in repentance: “I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover my iniquity” (v.5). “Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered” (v.1).\n\nWe also scurry around trying to create life for ourselves through our super-fabulous accomplishments. I feel so much better when I’m a genius at work, a lovely wife, or the coolest mom. But does my life in the Kingdom actually have anything to do with my adorable talents? Our participation in the Kingdom of God is rooted in repentance, and all my busy actions and sacrifices are just that—business—unless my heart is willing to repent.\n\nI need to repent even of my righteousness. My actions do not earn my salvation. (Psalm 51)\n\nFinally, I seek life and comfort by defending, hiding and protecting myself. Is it your instinct to defend instead of repent when you encounter judgement? Years ago, when I was fresh out of college, I was accused of lying to my employer. Whether or not I’m a big liar is neither here nor there, but when I was brought before the big boss I sobbingly started to try to defend myself. He stopped me and told me I didn’t need to say a word in my own defense. He vouched for me, while I stood still and blew my nose on those rough brown paper napkins. That experience will stay with me forever—I don’t have to run to defend myself. Christ calls us to repentance, and He is our defender!\n\nAnd what freedom could possibly come from offering my own defense? True freedom is in forgiveness. Repentance gives true life even in the midst of judgment. We really have only two choices when we encounter judgment: harden our hearts, or repent. The author of Lamentations always runs to repentance.\n\nThis is why there is hope, even in the book of Lamentations. Sin has brought wreckage upon Jerusalem, though she was once great. Her people are hungry, and in their famine and their sorrow they call out to the Lord. Matthew Henry writes, “In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and entreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to make ourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lord for man’s transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows, lamentations, sickness, and death.”\n\nWe need to be washed from our sin, and only God can do that. It is in our calling out to Him, in acknowledging our sin, that we can enjoy the freedom in being washed clean from our transgressions. Hard-heartedness just leads to more judgement, but repentance leads to life.\n\nSo when I long for peace and spiritual cleansing, instead of reaching for my comfort in a latte and a good sugar scrub, I have to cry out, “Wash me, Lord!” (Psalm 51:2)\n\nRun to Him in repentance. Run to Him for peace. Because repentance gives life, and it’s a blessed sign of God’s grace and goodness.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Debbie Eaton\n\nText: Lamentations 1:12-22, Psalm 51:7-10\n\n“He that is jealous is not in love” \n\n– Saint Augustine\n\nWhat I am about to share is not something I am not proud of. As a matter of fact, it takes courage for me to even admit that a superficial struggle consumed me for years, challenging and endangering my relationship with my sister. It was only through my tears of repentance that God’s grace and forgiveness set me free… and set my sister free.\n\nI was so jealous of my sister. She is smart, tiny in stature, has an amazing husband and beautiful children. What I was most jealous of was her outward appearance. In my eyes she radiated outward beauty, the beauty seen on runways, in movies and magazines. Thin is in, and I despised going shopping with my sister as she picked out her size one while I sheepishly pulled double digits off the rack. It was so superficial, and yet the grip jealousy had on me was suffocating. It seeped into my envy of her two homes and her ability to have children. My sin was really ugly and blocked my ability to love her.\n\nThe jealousy seed took root when we were teenagers. Years later, the right conditions sprouted the destructive weeds of bitterness, distance, and a mean spirit. Like the writer of Lamentations, my sin had formed a yoke around my neck (Lam. 1:14) — my outward actions hurt my sister and my inward battle was torturous.\n\nGod was at work cleaning my prideful heart, exposing the raw places that were keeping me entangled in my own mess. He was renewing my spirit.\n\nCreate in me a clean heart, O God,\n\nAnd renew a right spirit within me.\n\n– Psalm 51:10, ESV\n\nEverything changed when my sister and her daughter visited for a week to help in the care of my newborn son. Each day she would disappear for hours on a run. I was left caring for my newborn and my six year old niece. This was not my idea of help. She felt distant, both physically and emotionally.\n\nWe went to lunch at one of my favorite cafés and I watched her push food around her plate, barely eating. I saw for the first time that my sister was weak, broken, unhealthy, and struggling with control because her life was out of control. Anorexia had gripped her.\n\n“Do you love yourself?” I asked.\n\nShe sat silently. “I’m not sure.”\n\n“Do you know God loves you?”\n\nSilence.\n\nOutwardly my sister was withering away and inwardly was frail. She was just like me.\n\nThe grip of jealously loosened and was replaced with an overwhelming sense of God’s compassion and love. God had to convict me of my sin before I could come alongside my sister and help point her to God’s unfailing love. She desperately needed Jesus and I shared.\n\nLeft alone, sin will strangle the life out of our heart and soul. It debilitates, destroys, and divides. The tighter the grip, the less we can breathe to sustain the inward and outward life.\n\nRepent and God will renew a right spirit within you. He will wash you whiter than snow. The triune God breathes life into our sin-gripped hearts, freeing us from sin’s bondage with His forgiveness that transforms us from the inside out.\n\n“But we cannot escape the embarrassment of standing stark naked before God. It is no use our trying to cover up like Adam and Eve in the garden. Our attempts at self-justification are as ineffectual as their fig-leaves. We have to acknowledge our nakedness, see the divine substitute wearing our filthy rags instead of us, and allow him to clothe us with his own righteousness.”\n\n– John Stott\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Cast Me Not Away",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Diana Stone\n\nText: Lamentations 2:1-11, Psalm 51:11-14\n\nThere’s a beautiful hymn by Keith Green based on Psalm 51:10-12 that I learned growing up. I liked the rhythm of it more than the words, and remember my mom—a song leader and pastor’s wife—humming it around the house when we were little.\n\nI’m an adult now, with a stronger faith than that little girl who sang “Create in Me a Clean Heart” in the hall. Still, the verse “Take not thy Holy Spirit from me” makes me stop short. Would He??\n\nThese passages we read today are Old Testament writings, a time when God directly interacted with His people through prophets and dreams and a burning bush. For one of them, whom our Lord inspired to write this Psalm, pleading to not be cast away from the Lord’s presence is a real and impactful prayer. Possession of the gift of the Holy Spirit was not a given—not a thing to be taken for granted.\n\nLike the Israelites, we are creatures of habit. We give our lives to Christ only to try to take them back again. We experience the true love of God, the redemption of our sins, but we are determined to come back in wallow in the mess of our own making—as if we don’t have a Savior. In the second chapter of Lamentations, we find the author continuing to grieve for Jerusalem, describing God’s wrath and sin’s effects on a people who have time and again disobeyed Him. Our Lord is Holy (Psalm 99)! He cannot be near sin; by His very nature He will not tolerate its presence. We cannot be reconciled to God apart from Jesus’ saving work on the Cross. Without Him, we are like the ruins of a destroyed city.\n\nWhat does this mean for us today—a broken humanity of hurting souls? It means we must return. Time and time again, amid the devastation and chaos of our wayward lives and deceitful hearts, we give ourselves back to the One who gives us life. We hand Him our ruins and receive His grace. We repent of our sins and ask again for His forgiveness—and Scripture promises He is faithful to give it (1 John 1:9).\n\nTake not your presence from me!, we cry. And because of Christ’s righteousness has been credited to us, He grants our request! The God of all mercy and all holiness draws His repentant children near and does not cast them away—this is the good news of the Gospel.\n\nI’m drawn to the words “reconciliation” and “forgiveness” time and time again in Scripture. God never stops offering them! Even in Lamentations, standing in the ruins, the writer’s words of hope seem to call out on our behalf (Lam. 3:55-57). God will rescue us from the depths of our pit if we only ask.\n\nBut we must ask. We must repent and receive the forgiveness our Savior has already secured. He won’t chase us down and chain us to his holy chariot — but He does extend His hand. He does pursue our hearts and offer us the sacred opportunity to follow Him.\n\nFollow or flee. Turn toward Him or turn away. Return or reject.\n\nMay we return today and receive His love anew. Thank God He is faithful to give it.\n\n“…if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.”\n\n– 2 Chronicles 7:14\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sarah Matheny\n\n\n\n Text: Lamentations 2:12-22, Psalm 51:15-19\n\nAmong the many traits the girls in my family have acquired from their mama (enormously wild hair and enthusiastic thesaurus-reading not to be forgotten), is that fact that we possess some pretty sensitive souls. I mean, we feel all the feels. My mom likes to tell the story of how, at age four, I completely lost it because my dad gave me a goodnight kiss and did not equally place both his lips on top of both of my lips. I’m still reeling from the rejection. What that means in my current household, though, is that during any watching of children’s movies, insurance advertisements or yes, even game shows, my finger must be constantly poised on the remote control so I can power “off” when the offending purple minion, car accident dramatization or embarrassingly wrong Final Jeopardy response comes on screen.\n\nAdmittedly, when I read through these very dark, very sorrowful passages in Lamentations, I wish I had my finger on the remote control and could power “off.” The destruction, the groans, the torment—it is unbearable. And the author, once a matter-of-fact eyewitness, is tortured, his heart pouring out on the ground because of the devastation God has inflicted against a sinful people (Lamentations 2:11). In other words, he gives new meaning to “feeling all the feels.”\n\nBut isn’t that the point? How can we truly experience real repentance without sorrow?\n\nGod wants nothing less than broken spirits and contrite hearts when we come before Him for His forgiveness. Any ritualistic sacrifices, any well-crafted prayers, any flowery pleas for mercy—without being genuinely crushed by the true tragedy of our sins—are utterly and totally meaningless. God wants only your authentic expressions of repentance, no thesauruses required.\n\nGod doesn’t want us to just be “bummed out” by the consequences of sin in our lives and our world, He wants us to know what true, godly sorrow looks and feels like. He wants our hearts to break like His, and for us to gather up those messy hearts and bring them before Him laid bare, without pretentiously tying them up in a neat little package.\n\n“The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart…” (Psalm 51:17).  Nothing more. Nothing less.\n\nMy remote-control strategy of parenting has backfired into sleepless nights a time or two, with those last-seen images burning into little minds and re-entering them, unfortunately, right at bedtime. I quickly learned that I had to, somehow, help my children get through the hard parts of the narrative if they were ever going to see and appreciate how the story ends. I don’t want them to miss it.\n\nWe have a Father who loves each and every one of His children enough to break our hearts, so that our own story never actually ends at all, but lives on with Him for Eternity. Even though it costs us the anguish of standing in the midst of the ugly destruction of our own sin, it cost our God far more—the sacrifice of His own precious Son. He will bring beauty from the ashes—and more than anything, He doesn’t want you to miss it.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "But This I Call To Mind",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Lamentations 3:1-33, Psalm 32:1-2\n\n“My soul is bereft of peace.\n\nI have forgotten what happiness is;\n\nso I say, ‘My endurance has perished;\n\nso has my hope from the Lord.’”\n\n– Lamentations 3:17-18, ESV\n\n“I have forgotten what happiness is…” It sounds so dramatic, but I’ve had those moments and I bet you have, too. Moments get honestly low. Times get impossibly tough. Not one of us is exempt from the reality of grief, and I don’t doubt that every one of us sitting down together today can call to mind a moment when our endurance has threatened to perish.\n\nAs we read the words in Lamentations 3, different moments in my life flash into memory. I’ve never been attacked by a bear or shot at with an arrow, but I can certainly recall seasons of “grinding my teeth on gravel”, as the Lamentor so vividly puts it.\n\nJust the other day I sat down with my sister to talk about this passage and read it aloud with her, and after the second time through, something minor yet monumental stuck out to me. Do you see in verse 21—the moment the entire book of Lamentations climaxes—when the author’s sense of rejection by God shifts to confidence in Him? Pay attention to his words here:\n\n“But this I call to mind.”\n\nI missed it the first time and almost missed it the second, but it feels huge. The author of Lamentations (believed to be Jeremiah but no one knows for sure) doesn’t say, “But this is what I think is going to happen,” or even, “But this is what I wish would happen.” The turning point of Lamentations is not a moment of speculation.\n\nNo! He’s remembering something! Something he knows is true.\n\nThe Lamentor is calling to mind a truth he already knows, and it’s something that—in spite of the bears and arrows and rocks in his teeth—gives him a sure hope at the very moment his endurance is perishing:\n\n“The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;\n\nhis mercies never come to an end;\n\nthey are new every morning;\n\ngreat is your faithfulness.”\n\n– Lamentations 3:22-23, ESV\n\nHow does he know? What is this memory? Is it from his own personal life experience, or is he drawing from beyond his own life to his forefathers’ history with the Lord of Mercy?\n\nConsider how David drew from the testimony of his people in Psalm 22:4:\n\n“In you our fathers trusted;\n\nthey trusted, and you delivered them.\n\nTo you they cried and were rescued;\n\nin you they trusted and were not put to shame.”\n\nI think sometimes we forget God is bigger than what we know of Him from personal experience. That’s why it’s so important to learn about God in history and keep our own relationships with God personal, but not private!\n\nWhat if I found myself in a hopeless situation, but my only personal experience with God’s deliverance was that one time He helped me find my retainer in high school (yes, I wore a retainer in high school. ahem.), and the time our team miraculously won the volleyball state finals when we were down our best player? When I need to call to mind a steadfast love, I get to reach way farther back than 32 years!\n\nThe God and Creator of the universe has scripted an enormous and lovingly elaborate story of love and provision and salvation for His people. So, we, just like the Lamentor, get to “call to mind” the great deeds and marvelous rescues of our God over generations.\n\nYour God who sits with you today, while you are afraid and dying and bitter with heavy chains and a crooked path? He’s the God who slayed a giant with a stone in a slingshot, rebuilt Jerusalem’s wall and delivered an entire nation from slavery. Same God—then and now.\n\nSo THIS we call to mind: God has a track record of faithfulness and mercy that reaches back millennia, far before and beyond us! It is a record that, time and again, points to this truth which turns the book of Lamentations on its head and allows us to return from the darkest night to a light of hope:\n\n“Great is your faithfulness.”\n\n\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Diana Stone\n\nText: Lamentations 3:34-66, Psalm 32:3-5\n\nSustaining grace does not promise the absence of struggle but the presence of God.\n\n– Max Lucado\n\nLately I’ve filtered my conversations with God. Many of my moments with Him begin, “If You allow…, then I will…”  My vague threats quickly turn to silence for fear of what else my flawed heart might say.\n\nI recently learned that I’m pregnant. It’s my fourth pregnancy, our fifth child, and yet only one of our children lives on earth. This pregnancy was a surprise, but even more surprising have been the emotions I feel toward God right now. I’m a believer, but I find myself doubting. I know He loves me, but I find myself wondering. Like the writer of Lamentations, I’m standing in the wreckage of what could have been, but isn’t—and I’m questioning aloud if God is here.\n\n“If you let this child die, I will never forgive you. Never believe in you again. How can you claim you are sovereign if you continually let this happen to us?”\n\nSo my prayers are weak and unbelieving. Distant. Filtered. I avoid confessing my anger and my hurt. Will God punish me? Will He even care? I’ve always struggled with prayer, but now more than ever before. My own sinfulness delights in this withdrawal from God to near silence. Filtering my prayers and pleas, my hopes and fears, means allowing my human nature to take back over. Not bringing my true emotions into the light is just another way of delaying what I know I need to do.\n\nI need to repent. Even here in this moment— especially here. I am angry for the loss of my children, I am distraught at these blows to my faith, I am hurt that God did not rescue us from the storm that caused this wreckage. I am tempted to draw a line in the sand and say, “No. My faith in You can not go any further.” And though it is painful to say it all aloud, I know His love for me and my children is not threatened by any of these emotions. I know He hears me. And I know He is here.\n\nSo like the poet, I turn back to God with all of me—even the angry, confused and weary parts.\n\n“Let us search out and examine our ways,\n\nand turn back to the Lord.\n\nLet us lift up our hearts and our hands\n\nto God in heaven”\n\n– Lamentations 3:40-41\n\nSometimes, it’s just all we have left to wearily “lift our hearts and our hands to God in heaven.” We all are sinners, regardless of the circumstances we’re walking through. We live in a broken world where awful things happen, and we don’t get to choose what happens to us. But the choice we have is this: what we will do when we realize how much God loves us? Is faith truly faith if we set limits and issue demands? Do we love someone simply because they save me from the uncomfortable?\n\nDoes our Lord love us this way?\n\nPaul reminds us how to strengthen our faith and turn to God in times of trial:\n\n“…a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited. Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.’”\n\n– 2 Corinthians 12: 7-9\n\nPaul pleads with the Lord. He keeps bringing his pain back to God—not hiding it from Him—so that God can administer grace once more.\n\nOur God sovereignly waits for me to return to Him with my brokenness, just like He waits for you. I don’t have to waste away in silence. I don’t need to draw lines, set boundaries, or attempt to control any outcome. I need to repent of these things, allowing the Holy Spirit to bend my will to the Lord’s. Knowing my Savior also suffered, I accept His perfect “grace upon grace” in the midst of the chaos and confusion we will all experience.\n\nOur pain and our emotions are real, but so is our God. His grace is enough.\n\n“Prayer is the breath of the new man, drawing in the air of mercy in petitions, and returning it in praises; it proves and maintains the spiritual life.”\n\n– Matthew Henry\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_title": "When You May Be Found",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Lamentations 4:1-11, Psalm 32:6-7\n\nI confess I’m easily, daily, hourly tricked by the exterior of a person — what they look like, where they live, what they do with their days, even how the world classifies them in terms of wealth and status and ethnicity and name. I confess I believe the lie that those things matter; I confess I have to remind myself of the person inside the person—the story and soul that make them who they are.\n\nI remember reading CS Lewis’s essay “The Weight of Glory” for the first time, how it gripped my heart and imagination with the truth that people are just souls with bodies. I say “just” like it’s no big deal, but the truth is, it’s a very big deal. The biggest, actually. The folks I drove past on the interstate today, them in their car and I in mine; the nice young man who handed me our dinner at the drive-thru window on the way home from a late day; the woman who listened as my son breathed deeply in and out as he sat on the table in the doctor’s office; the mom who walked out of that room with her own sick boy just before we walked in—they are each the creation of a loving God. They are each the soul Jesus died to save.\n\n“There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations—these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit—immortal horrors or everlasting splendors.”\n\n– CS Lewis, “The Weight of Glory”\n\nWhew. It’s heavy, right?\n\nBut Lewis is right. These false classifications and temporary circumstances I confess to idolizing can change in an instant—but I hold them up nonetheless. I tend to judge myself just as harshly—What right do I have to my health and my home, my family and my job? And there I go, carrying false guilt around with my true guilt and wondering why it’s so hard to stand.\n\nLike the gold and the stones in this passage from Lamentations, all the shiny things eventually tarnish and all the strong things soon scatter—and if my hope for myself and others is found in anything but God, I am tossed around like a dry leaf in the wind. Like the lady Jerusalem, I stand in ruins, longing just for a place to hide.\n\nTherefore let everyone who is godly\n\noffer prayer to you at a time when you may be found;\n\nsurely in the rush of great waters,\n\nthey shall not reach him.\n\nYou are a hiding place for me;\n\nyou preserve me from trouble;\n\nyou surround me with shouts of deliverance. Selah\n\n– Psalm 32:6-7 ESV\n\nThe consequences of my sin are devastating, but more devastating still is my lack of repentance. Lack of repentance breeds shame, and shame whispers lies in my ear. Shame tells me I can’t be forgiven. Shame tells me I’m not worth forgiving. But the Cross tells a different story—the true story.\n\nJesus knew shame. The beloved hymn says it well:\n\nOn a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,\n\nThe emblem of suffering and shame;\n\nAnd I love that old cross where the dearest and best\n\nFor a world of lost sinners was slain.\n\nJesus endured my shame on the Cross, every last ounce. He endured yours, too. When I’m guilty of shaming others… when I’m guilty of shaming myself… when I am guilty of forgetting who He is, who I am in Him, and who YOU are in Him — His sacrifice covers it all.\n\nWill you seek Christ with me today just as you are, sin and all? Will you believe with me that He can be found? He is there on the Cross, with mercy enough for you and for me.\n\nMatthew Henry writes, “In a time of finding, when the heart is softened with grief, and burdened with guilt; when all human refuge fails; when no rest can be found to the troubled mind, then it is that God applies the healing balm by his Spirit.”\n\nMay our hearts be softened by grief and burdened with a godly guilt that leads to repentance. When all human refuge fails—and, by God’s grace, even before!—may we repent and look to the Cross.\n\n \n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Lamentations 4:12-22, Psalm 32:8-11\n\nI’m the worst athlete. But just to make sure, my parents made me try all of the sports when I was growing up. I was so excited to receive a basketball trophy in the 5th grade for being “the only player to not score any points.”\n\nIf I had to pick a sport I was the least terrible at, it would be competitive swimming. For a short season, I inhaled glorious chlorine fumes and flaunted a one-piece like a true athlete. I preferred long distance events because they require more endurance than technique and, unlike basketball, a majority of the swimmers were short, meaning I had a leg up on the competition. Literally.\n\nBut my favorite part about swimming was that I didn’t feel much pressure. Coaching takes place before the actual event and spectators lose interest after the first few laps, so my victories were small and my losses unnoticed.\n\nThe only person to see my every move was the lifeguard who sat in a tall plastic chair, overseeing the safety of the swimmers. His only job was to keep me from drowning or to blow his red whistle if I were to cross into someone else’s lane or, say, hit my head on a diving block. He was pretty quiet for the most part and I liked it that way. Between my flailing freestyle strokes and gasps for air, I never really noticed him.\n\nSomehow, and for a time much longer than my swimming career, I allowed this lifeguard mentality to frame my relationship with God.\n\nI’ll just keep doing my thing and you let me know if I’m out of line.\n\nSave me from tragedy and I’ll call on you when I need help.\n\nMeanwhile, my execution might be mediocre, but I’ve got this.\n\nWhen I read that God “sees” me, my rule-following tendency assumes it’s a warning, as if God’s blowing the same red whistle and saying, “I’m watching you. Behave.”\n\nI wish I could write a really endearing story about repentance, but the truth is, I’m still aiming for endurance, hoping to finish the race unnoticed. When I do ask God for forgiveness, it’s more a quick gasp of air to sustain me until the next time I feel guilty enough to swallow the reality of my sin.\n\nI become overwhelmed by the inadequacy of my sorriness, leading only to repentance for my lack of repentance. But then I’m stuck, drowning in weight of whispered words to God, face down in my transgressions, and that’s where I stay.\n\nI begin to believe repentance is more about my guilt than being freed from it.\n\nWhile I know God sees me, I don’t look for Him because I’d rather live in ignorance.\n\nI’d rather perceive God as an obligatory watch guard or stoic spectator than see Him grow and refine me. I choose surface apology and manufacture makeshift grace for myself.\n\nAnd Lord, I don’t want to any longer.\n\nYou are well-versed in the depth of my fears.\n\nYou are mindful of my faintest joys.\n\nYou don’t just see me; you see me through.\n\nMay the comfort of your gaze push me to bold, unashamed expression of my need for you.\n\nAmen.\n\nKaitlin Wernet is a Carolina girl who now plants her feet in Tennessee as the Community Coordinator for She Reads Truth.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kelsey King\n\nText:  Lamentations 5:1-22, Isaiah 55:1-13\n\nBack in the day, in the glory of middle school, I was a cheerleader. It was a short-lived phase, really, but little 13-year old Kels was all about the poms. There’s a chance I have since burned the pictures to prove it, but even nine years later, ask me to cheer on the Chantilly Chargers and I’ve got it on lock.\n\nThe name of the sport speaks for itself. Cheerleaders are to be the leaders of cheer—the ones who pump up both the players and the crowd, faithfully standing on the sidelines as a symbol of support for those in the trenches of the game.\n\nThis is the thing: though I still have the flippy skirt from my days of cheerleading yore, I’m not always a cheerleader— of my people, of their successes, of their joys, or of their victories. Sometimes, and perhaps even often, I am cynical and critical. I mask it as being “realistic,” but that is really just a shoddy attempt to loosen myself from the call to encourage and build up.\n\nIf I’m being honest, and this seems like both a safe and terrifying place to do so, my lack of cheering on my people can be linked back to some level of jealousy, insecurity, or fear of not measuring up. Often a combination of all three. Instead of rejoicing alongside my brothers and sisters, my train of thought can sometimes read like this:\n\nI should have gotten that job.\n\nI could have written that piece just as well.\n\nThat boy could have liked me too.\n\nI’m just as good a friend as she is.\n\nWhat I accomplished is more important.\n\nWhen I trace back these insecurities, I make a startling discovery: I’m afraid God’s economy is one of scarcity, and I believe there might not be enough of Him to go around. But Sisters, His economy is one of abundance! He pleads with us, “Come, everyone who thirsts!” (Isaiah 55:1, emphasis mine). Everyone. God is not stingy with His blessing—there is enough of His infinite goodness for all of us. Talent and creativity and joy and peace are wonderful—and truly they are gifts from God! But true restoration is not found in our success or another’s failure, but in reconciliation to the one true God.\n\nI might have traded in the sidelines for the stands when it comes to football, but God help me, I want to be marked by a posture of leading the cheers for my brothers and sisters in Christ as they run the race of faith. Instead of feigned excitement for their earthly accomplishments, I want a heart that sincerely roots for their eternal redemption. Rather than foster feelings of jealousy or competition, I want see my co-laborers in the Kingdom “go out in joy and be led forth in peace” (Isaiah 55:12).\n\nLord, like the writer of Lamentations, give me a heart that longs not just for my own renewal but the renewal of the people of God.\n\n“Restore us to yourself, O Lord, that we may be restored!” Amen.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Luke 9:43-45, 51-52, John 10:14-18\n\nWhen the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.\n\nLuke 9:51, ESV\n\nMy in-laws live in Michigan. It’s a solid 9-hour drive from our house in Tennessee to enjoy their mild, midwestern summers and wonderland northern winters, but it is absolutely always worth it.\n\nWell, almost always. There is usually a moment—at about hour 7.5—where we’re past Cincinnati but still super far from Toledo and the kids have both used up all their charming travel puzzles and games, they’ve gotten whiney from too much screen time, and we’ve cut them off from snacks because snacks make them thirsty and drinks make them potty and we have made enough stops already forgoodnesssake.\n\nThat’s the moment when we front-seaters exchange exasperated-slash-desperate looks of “why did we think driving was a good idea?” and “couldn’t we have left the kids in Tennessee with friends and enjoyed a quiet drive just the two of us?” I’m pretty sure that wouldn’t go over very well with the grandparents.\n\nBut once we finally get there, we’re always so glad we came. We know it the moment we make that right turn onto their street to see Granddad and Groovy waving and grinning, with the pool all clean and heated and good things cooking in the oven. The being there always makes it worth it, but the getting there just about kills us.\n\nEnter my brilliant and blessed son, Oliver. I guess he was probably five at the time he invented the “Rocket Boost”, and it is now everyone’s favorite way to travel. The Rocket Boost is simple: close your eyes, force yourself to sleep, and next thing you know, you’ve completely slept through Kentucky! (Or Connecticut, or wherever it is you’re passing through.) Rocket Boosting is the best basic travel trick we know; even I have been known to sneak a Rocket Boost in the passenger seat from time to time!\n\nFriends, today we are doing a little Rocket Boost of our own. You may remember our Lent study is divided into three parts: Return, Repent, and Remember. We left you on Friday repenting and lamenting in 586 BC with the Israelites, worshiping and crying out amid the rubble of the destroyed Temple. Today we Rocket Boost about 600 years forward—past the Babylonian Exile, the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls under the leadership of Nehemiah, and 400 years of silence between the Old and New Testament—and when we open our eyes, we will see the in-the-flesh Promised Messiah prophesying of Himself, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (John 2:19).\n\nSo, let’s stretch our arms, sit up straight, and renew our focus on the road—it’s time to “Remember” the narrative of our Savior’s last days. Over the next 3 weeks we will follow the Son of God from the moment He sets His face to Jerusalem, to the time the New Holy Temple—the One the Israelites cried out for in Lamentations and the One who forever eliminated the need for a curtain of separation between us and God—is indeed raised again in three days, just as He said.\n\nAs we begin this time of remembrance with Jesus “setting His face to Jerusalem”, let’s acknowledge the gravity of this moment. Jesus was setting His sights on the place where He would die for sinners in accordance with the will of God. He knew what awaited Him. As John Piper put it, “Jerusalem meant one thing for Jesus: certain death.” Jesus set His face toward Jerusalem out of obedience to the Father and love for sinners—you and me.\n\nThe world was under a curse of death, and our only possible rescue required a Man who was both Offerer and Offering. He couldn’t come as an Offering only, served up by an angry crowd as He fought tooth and nail to escape, or doing everything in His power to avoid Jerusalem altogether. No—He had to be the Offerer as well. Jesus’ life was His to give, and in turning His face toward Jerusalem, He was setting into motion the final days of our Great Rescue.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText:  Matthew 6:9-13,  Isaiah 53:10-11,\n\nI have a notion that what seem our worst prayers may really be, in God’s eyes, our best…\n\nFor these, perhaps, being nearly all will, come from a deeper level than feeling.\n\n– CS Lewis, from Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer\n\nI can’t pray out loud without crying. I have no idea why this is or exactly when it started, but ask me to pray aloud – in front of one person or 100 – and there will be puddles in my eyes by the time we reach Amen.\n\nIf you’re thinking this makes me super holy, you’re totally right. [If we were texting, this is where I would insert one of those cry-laughing emoji guys. In other words, sarcasm alert.]\n\nBut I know me, and I know my auto-tears don’t mean what you might think they mean. I know how hard I struggle with prayer, how the concept of talking to God has always made me feel intimidated, disoriented, strange. I know how my tears are less often tears of belief and more often tears of “I believe, help my unbelief” (Mark 9:24). And while some days prayer flows like breath from my lips — Thank you and Please Lord and Help me — most days my prayers start more like a grocery list than a love letter. Here are the things I know I need. Here are the things I need to remember.  Here are the people I ought to pray for.\n\nIt’s no wonder I was relieved to read CS Lewis’ comment that “prayer is irksome.” Or, as my handy thesaurus might say, it’s frustrating. Exasperating. Disagreeable. Prayer doesn’t always come naturally. We were made for communion with our Heavenly Father—but so long as we are being sanctified here on earth, we’ll struggle with this tension of praying for a Kingdom that has come and is yet to come.\n\nJesus knows we’ll need help in prayer department when teaches His disciples how to pray, saying clearly, “Pray like this.” What follows, now known as The Lord’s Prayer, is not flowery or overly emotional. It is bold. Intentional. Concise.\n\nFather, Your name is holy.\n\nBring Your Kingdom, Lord.\n\nYour will be done, not mine.\n\nWe depend on You for our life, our everything.\n\nForgive us and help us to forgive.\n\nAll glory is Yours, forever. Amen.\n\n“Thy kingdom come.” Only Jesus could truly understand the weight of this simple prayer. Only He knows how difficult the act of prayer can truly be or what this Kingdom-to-come really looks like.\n\nYet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer…\n\n– Isaiah 53:10a, NIV\n\nJust as we saw in yesterday’s reading when Jesus “set His face to Jerusalem” knowing full well what it would mean, He also knew exactly what He was praying when He petitioned for God’s Kingdom to be ushered in. The coming of the Kingdom of God required the current, real-life sacrifice of God’s only Son.\n\nI want to pray those words like Jesus prayed — not because I feel like praying but because I know and believe in the goodness and holiness of the One to whom I pray.\n\nI want to give God glory in each and every thing, even when it hurts.\n\nI want to desperately depend on God for my provision on the great days and the awful days.\n\nI want to seek God’s will above my own, even when I don’t understand it.\n\nI want to pray for God’s Kingdom to come — both in the Now and in the Not Yet.\n\n“The petition, then,” says Lewis, “is not merely that I may patiently suffer God’s will but also that I may vigorously do it. I must be an agent as well as a patient. I am asking that I may be enabled to do it. In the long run I am asking to be given ‘the same mind which was also in Christ’” (emphasis mine).\n\nOh, how I want the mind of Christ! Oh, how I long for my prayers to be worshipful breaths of obedience and my tears always sincere. I want to not just pray “Your kingdom come” but to seek to vigorously do it!\n\nI want to daily lay down the banner of my kingdom and pick up the banner of the Kingdom of God.\n\nFriends, in the spirit of praying for the coming of God’s Kingdom and the nearness of the Son (and because it’s Saint Patrick’s Day!), let’s close our time today praying these beautiful words from St. Patrick’s Breastplate:\n\nChrist be with me, Christ within me,\n\nChrist behind me, Christ before me,\n\nChrist beside me, Christ to win me,\n\nChrist to comfort and restore me.\n\nChrist beneath me, Christ above me,\n\nChrist in quiet, Christ in danger,\n\nChrist in hearts of all that love me,\n\nChrist in mouth of friend and stranger.\n\nMay it be so, Lord.\n\nAmen.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Last Supper",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Luke 22:1-2, 7-30\n\nIt’s become a running joke in my family that my mother always gets skipped at communion. In our church we stand up, pew by pew, and file to the front to kneel at the communion rail. I don’t know how or why it happens, but almost always, the bread and cup are distributed to the person on my mom’s left, then almost immediately, to the person on her right. She’s left with the choice to either leave empty-handed or disruptively wave her arms, demanding the bread and cup.\n\nMost of the time, she sits quietly, questioning what she did wrong. Is it the way I held my hands? Was I supposed to say a certain prayer? Did I not make enough eye contact?\n\nIt’s just a fluke, of course, that the service plates somehow pass her by, but it makes for some pretty amazing lunch conversation.\n\nIsn’t it interesting how Jesus chose our faulty human hands to distribute a reminder of the perfection found in Him? And yet, the coordination of the Last Supper was anything but flawed.\n\nI love it when Jesus sends Peter and John to arrange the meal and they ask, “Where do you want us to prepare it?” I wonder if they expect to help Jesus brainstorm a place to hold the supper, or even anticipate offering to open their own homes. Little do they understand that this night has been set into motion from the beginning of time. The disciples think they’re the hosts, when they’re really the guests.\n\nFrom the man carrying the pitcher of water, to the guest room already set aside for the event—every detail was perfectly planned. But my favorite phrase in the whole passage is, “and they left and found everything just as He had told them.” Just yesterday, I opened my pantry to an entire bag of rotten avocados, so the concept of finding everything just as I expected is rather foreign to me.\n\nThe flawless coming together of the Last Supper isn’t a coincidence or even just a final miracle on Jesus’ last day. Look closely and you’ll see Jesus building the framework for countless times in the days ahead when the disciples would find things just as He had told them. Like the disciples, we hold this track record of our Lord’s faithful fulfillment of His promises close to our hearts, so when the time comes, like the hymn writer says, we’ll remember — although  “The Father turns His face away,” “The wounds which mar the chosen one bring many sons to glory.”\n\nJesus knew we would struggle to grasp the weight of His sacrifice and the fullness of His forgiveness.\n\nHe knew we’d be tempted to load that weight on our backs in an effort to re-do the work He’s already completed.\n\nHe knew, even then, we’d forget the depth of our need for Him and trick ourselves into believing our faulty hands are clean.\n\nSo, He spent the final hours before His arrest reminding us to remember by instituting a meal of remembrance—by instructing us to use the simple elements of bread and wine to remind us of His body and blood.\n\nAnother name for communion is the Holy Eucharist, which I love, because it comes from a Greek word meaning “thanksgiving.”\n\nAnd so, we remember His body broken. And we beg not to forget His blood spilled. And we give thanks, because “He who has promised us is faithful.” (Hebrews 10:23)\n\nFriends, we’ve been through some tough passages during the Lenten season, and revisiting the Crucifixion will be no different. Let’s fix our eyes on the framework of faithfulness Christ has laid before us. Approach in your hearts the table of thanksgiving established by our Savior, and find everything  just as He told us.\n\n“Bread of the world, in mercy broken,\n\nWine of the soul, in mercy shed,\n\nBy whom the words of life were spoken,\n\nAnd in whose death our sins are dead:\n\nLook on the heart by sorrow broken,\n\nLook on the tears by sinners shed;\n\nAnd by Thy feast to us the token\n\nThat by Thy grace our souls are fed.”\n\n—Reginald Heber\n\nKaitlin Wernet is a Carolina girl who now plants her feet in Tennessee as the Community Coordinator for She Reads Truth.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sarah Matheny\n\nText: Isaiah 51:17, Luke 22:39-46\n\nWhile the image of Jesus hanging on the cross is truly agonizing, it is somehow the account of the Garden of Gethsemane that grieves me deepest. It is here, with Jesus on His hands and knees, weeping and pleading with God, that I feel the fullness of His humanity and the depth of His sacrifice. It is in this garden that I feel the weight of His suffering at my hands.\n\nHe made His way into the garden, away from the disciples, and He prayed, “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.” (Luke 22:42, NIV)\n\nIt’s hard for us to wrap our believing hearts around Jesus asking to be spared the Cross – the very purpose of His incarnation. But He puts an asterisk on His very human request by declaring His obedience at any cost.\n\nThroughout the Old Testament, “the cup” is used as a metaphor for God’s judgment and His wrath, as in Isaiah 51:17: “You have drunk the cup of the Lord’s fury. You have drunk the cup of terror, tipping out its last drops” (NIV). So when Jesus prays about avoiding the cup, He’s fully aware of what He is about to do by going to the cross: He is drinking the cup of God’s wrath. Yes, He’s taking on the physical agony of the cross, but He is also taking on the spiritual agony of separation from His loving father. And that separation is the pain that is breaking Him down in the garden.\n\nBut without missing a beat, He prays on.\n\n“Yet not my will, but yours be done.”\n\nAnd this is where I am convicted for all the times I complain about my own “suffering” in this life.\n\n“Yet not my will, but yours be done.”\n\nAnd this is where I am made keenly aware of my foolish attempts to build my own plans for my life.\n\n“Yet not my will, but yours be done.”\n\nAnd this is where I stop rushing through the Lenten season to get to the glorious celebration on Easter morning. The garden is where I pause to hear His sobs and His prayers. It’s where I see that cup we poured so violently spilling over. And it’s where I thank Him for His willingness to drink every last drop of it. For me.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellie Holcomb\n\nBetrayed. My stomach turns at the word. I remember vividly when someone I loved dearly and deeply turned into an enemy. There was a proverbial knife in my back and I was hurt, angry, and aching. I wonder how many of you have walked through betrayal. It is awful. You’re powerless to stop the pain and you keep wishing in vain that it could somehow be a different story.\n\nJesus wished it could be a different story, too. Just before this scene in Mark where He is betrayed by Judas and arrested, He was in a garden on his knees in deep distress, begging His Father to take the cup (Mark 14:35). Jesus knew what was coming and that it would feel unbearable. He’d asked His three dearest friends on earth to pray for Him, too—but three times, He comes to find them asleep. In His deepest hour of need, dreading what lies before Him, His friends can’t even keep their eyes open.\n\nI can’t imagine how lonely this must have felt. And yet, Jesus is not a victim, but a volunteer.\n\nIn the middle of a crowd armed with swords and clubs, in response to the excruciating task set before Him, Jesus says, “…the Scriptures must be fulfilled” (v.49).\n\nAnd even as He utters these words, “…everyone deserted him and fled” (v.50). Jesus will face this dreaded mission alone, and eventually even His own Father will have to turn His back as Jesus takes upon Himself all of our shame and iniquity—all our brokenness upon His broken body and into His breaking heart (Mark 15:34).\n\nSon of Man, Son of God, Living Word—betrayed for our sake. He drinks the cup of death that we deserve, so that our cups might overflow.\n\nSisters, have you been betrayed, wounded, discarded, deserted, abused, unfairly treated?\n\nYou are not alone.\n\nOur Savior suffered, too. He suffered for us, so we could know that we never face betrayal or any sort of suffering alone. Emmanuel, God with us. Let’s take our pain, our breaking hearts, our anger, our questions, and all the things in life that make us feel powerless and helpless to Him today.\n\nHe was arrested so we could be set free.\n\nHe was deserted so we could know we’re never alone.\n\nHe was betrayed so we could be held in the arms of Love.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Mark 14:26-31, 66-72\n\nBefore I was married, I told myself I would never be unkind to my husband. Occasionally failing at that, I promised myself I would never holler at my children. When the children and the hollering came along, I vowed that I would try to eat fiber for breakfast.\n\nI was such a great wife, mom, and eater of fiber before I actually had to do those things. It’s like the way I felt about parenting before I was a parent — the judgy way I looked at a tantrum-throwing child sporting snow boots, a runny nose, and hair that was last brushed three days ago. I always thought, “I will NEVER parent like that!” Baby, was I surprised to have a husband, children, and unlimited breakfast cereal choices as an adult.\n\nWhen I read this story of Peter denying Christ, I see myself. I’m that loudmouth who would stand up and promise, “Lord, I would NEVER deny you!” Jesus was addressing them all, but Peter is the guy who is so sure he’s going to get it right that he argues with Jesus.\n\nAll the disciples hid and denied Christ in their own way that night. It felt like the world was ending. I’m sure they found all kinds of ways to justify their actions, just like I would have. Reading this story, it’s easy for me to say, “I, at least, would have stood with Jesus, unlike those cowardly disciples.” But, based on my track record of vow-keeping, I would probably have hid like greasy rat.\n\nFor crying out loud, what is wrong with me? In all my best intentions to do right, I fall away, again and again, and stinking again. Just like Peter, I psych myself up, “I won’t do it wrong this time. This time for sure!” But, in the end, I’m right there with Peter, listening to the rooster crow and holding my head in my hands.\n\nJesus knew this would happen. He knew His disciples we going to fail Him. He knew I would get parenting and marriage wrong, day after day. But this is why He came. This is exactly why He came.\n\nDon’t miss this moment to see your need for Him. It’s the first step of the gospel: just to see that you need Him. See it.\n\nWhen Jesus tells Peter he will deny Him three times, He’s not clanging the final bell of doom for Peter. He’s confronting Peter’s sin, but He’s not rejecting Peter’s salvation. We, like Peter,  must see the true nature of our sin, to see the truth of our salvation.\n\nWhen we see our sin and our need of Christ, our response must be like Peter’s—to weep bitterly for our betrayals, and to repent. Take your head in your hands and weep when you need to, then rise in repentance and walk in a new direction.\n\nJesus knows you, like He knew Peter. Despite all your adamant protestations that you’ll never deny Him again, Jesus knows your sin and He loves you still.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Psalm 22:1-26, Isaiah 53:1-3, Luke 22:63-65, John 19:1-5\n\nAny day now, I’m going to have a baby.\n\nBirth is one of those elemental moments in life: I’ll get to really yell and really cry. I love birth because I just can’t control it; I’ll go into labor when the time is right. One day soon I’ll be folding laundry, or lounging in a co-worker’s nice leather chair, and SOMETHING will HAPPEN—I’ll go into labor. Don’t you just love it with something happens?\n\nSo many days follow suit, one after another—but when something really happens we all stop and stare, or yell, or get out our phones to make videos. We really pay attention in these elemental moments of pain. Folks are always asking me to prophesy WHEN the baby will be born, and I keep dodging with, “I’m not going to miss it.” That’s just it. Some things in life are so big, and so intense, it’s not possible to miss them. When the baby comes, I won’t just sleep through it.\n\nIntense moments grab our face on both sides and force us to pay attention. In my moment of need, I will be center stage. My husband will rub my back, my facebook friends will pray for me, my church is already preparing casseroles for me, my doula will speak encouraging words, and my midwife will attend me like a queen. It’s true. These people who love me will drop everything and turn their faces to me.\n\nBut for Christ, in His moment of greatest intensity, when SOMETHING is really HAPPENING, we see that people are turning their faces away from Him.\n\nWe are painfully aware of the human side of Christ in these passages. He is in agony (Psalm 22), He is alone and isolated (Isaiah 53), He is mocked (Luke 22), and He is rejected (John 19).\n\nIn Jesus’ darkest moment, His best friends—those disciples who are like brothers to Him— deny and abandon Him. They look around for places to hide.\n\nThe law turns its back on Him. Pilate finds no reason to punish Him, but allows Him to be taken away in spite of justice.\n\nAnd finally, most painful of all, His Father turns away from Him.\n\nWhen Jesus feels the sharp crown of thorns pressed into His head, He is alone. At a time when we all should be there, lovingly attending Him, we turn our faces away. Although Jesus was 100% God, He was also 100% man, and this isolation was real for Him. Everyone He loved left Him to suffer the hardest moment of His earthly life alone.\n\nLet this moment grab you by the face. Yell if you have to. Turn your face towards our Lord and see the cost of our sin piled on His sacred head.\n\nO sacred Head, now wounded, with grief and shame weighed down,\n\nNow scornfully surrounded with thorns, Thine only crown;\n\nO sacred Head, what glory, what bliss till now was Thine!\n\nYet, though despised and gory, I joy to call Thee mine.\n\nWhat Thou, my Lord, hast suffered, was all for sinners’ gain;\n\nMine, mine was the transgression, but Thine the deadly pain.\n\nLo, here I fall, my Savior! ’Tis I deserve Thy place;\n\nLook on me with Thy favor, vouchsafe to me Thy grace.\n\nWhat language shall I borrow to thank Thee, dearest friend,\n\nFor this Thy dying sorrow, Thy pity without end?\n\nO make me Thine forever, and should I fainting be,\n\nLord, let me never, never outlive my love to Thee.\n\n“O Sacred Head Now Wounded”\n\nattributed to Ber­nard of Clair­vaux, 1153\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sarah Matheny\n\nText: Luke 22:66-23:12, John 18:28-38, Isaiah 53:7-8\n\nHe was oppressed and He was afflicted,\n\nYet He did not open His mouth;\n\nLike a lamb that is led to slaughter,\n\nAnd like a sheep that is silent before its shearers,\n\nSo He did not open His mouth.\n\n– Isaiah 53:7, NASB\n\nIt’s a little known fact to anyone who steps into my homeschool classroom (in actuality, a small breakfast nook crowded with a well-loved child’s play kitchen, sticky high chair and watercolor-stained dinner table) that I used to be an attorney. Don’t judge.\n\nAs someone who has read textbook after textbook of case law and learned the rights guaranteed by the Constitution backwards and forwards, the trial of Jesus has me shaking my head at how such a tragedy of justice could take place. Due process? Hardly.\n\nThe list of injustices is lengthy:\n\nThe trial was illegally held in a private home.\n\nWitnesses were illegally called at night.\n\nJesus’ accusers “tried on” various charges until they found something, anything, on which Pilate had jurisdiction to rule.\n\nWhen Pilate didn’t want to rule, he shipped Jesus off to another judge, Herod. Herod mishandled the defendant and let his jailers mistreat Him—dressing Him mockingly in an elegant robe—after which Herod returned Jesus back to the first judge.\n\nJesus had every right, every opportunity and, obviously, full capability to protest. When you are the Son of God, I would assume you are more than equipped to argue your case pro se—that is, on your own. And yet, He didn’t.\n\nThere’s a phrase that makes any attorney cringe when they hear their client say it. It’s like nails on a chalkboard, whether the client is technically on the right or wrong side of the law. That phrase is, “I don’t care what it costs; it’s a matter of principle.” When you hear those words you then know this case is out of your hands, because your client’s ego, pride and need to prove him or herself right is on the line. Nothing is going to stop them.\n\nI’d argue that no one is any more “in the right” than Jesus. Yet He endured every injustice, every step of the way, without ego, pride or the need to prove Himself. He let go of standing up for the principle of the matter by standing up for those that principally matter to Him. You. Me.\n\nAs pastor and writer Adrian Rogers explains, “If Jesus had taken up His own defense with the intention of refuting his accusers and proving his innocence, he would have won. But we would have lost, and we would be lost for all eternity.”\n\nJesus had a totally different case strategy—to take His case, and ours, to a higher Judge. He is the ultimate example of turning the other cheek. In those instances when we want to stomp our feet and cry, “No fair!”—or “But I’m the one who’s right here!”—we have the freedom to say nothing at all. Christ is our perfect defense. We can take our satisfaction not in proving ourselves right, but in the knowledge that our ultimate fate has already been sealed by a higher Judge—One who sits not on a bench with a gavel, but on a throne of clouds, wielding mercy and unending compassion. Case dismissed.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Luke 23:13-25, Isaiah 53:10-11\n\nSo when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”\n\n– Matthew 27:17, NIV\n\nSunday mornings are the living worst at my house. There is no other day of the week that breeds more fighting, resentment, and tears for us. And I don’t mean the children. I am convinced my husband is a tyrant, rushing us all out of the house. I paused my writing just now to ask him to describe me on Sunday mornings. His whiskers bristled and he smiled, “Recalcitrant.” Then I had to get a dictionary, and I found this: “a person with an obstinately uncooperative attitude.” Fine, then, that’s me. We disagree about how to get our family of sixteen (might be just 6) out the door.\n\nThe thing is, Christ is the Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:23-28). It’s His rightful place. Caleb and I are both hugely inconvenienced that we are not lords of the Sabbath. It’s so much easier to make the wrong choices than actually submit my time and my life to Christ. I just like to choose me instead. But who in her right mind would choose someone—anyone—over Jesus?\n\nWhen Pilate proposes to release Jesus, the people cry out, “Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas!” Who is dirty Barabbas, and why is he even in this narrative?\n\nOk, so this blows my mind. First, his full name was “Jesus Barabbas.” Pilate is essentially asking the crowd, “Do you want Jesus Barabbas or Jesus, the Son of God?” There is an obvious parallel in the names.\n\nBut even more interestingly, the name “Barabbas” in Hebrew is “bar -abba”, or “son of the father.” So the full name of the murderer would have been “Jesus son of the father” (Matthew 27:17 NIV). When juxtaposed with the name of Christ “Jesus Son of the Father”, we can see that Barabbas’ appearance in this story is no accident.\n\nThe criminal’s name is an exact mirror of Christ’s name. The people get to make a choice between two “Jesus son of the fathers”—they could chose an innocent man accused of crimes, or a criminal to be released as an innocent man.\n\nIt was a clear-cut choice: choose the false man or the true man. Choose the innocent man or the murderer. But the crowd that day chose the wrong Jesus. They chose to call evil good and good evil. They chose Barabbas. It was the ultimate inversion of justice.\n\nWhy on earth did they choose Barabbas? It was tradition to let one prisoner go in honor of  Passover, and I reckon it felt pretty generous and righteous to set that prisoner free. And in this case, it seems so forgiving and merciful to let this obvious sinner go. Wildly, this was actually the more comfortable choice. Nevermind that they would all need to hide their wives and kids—they wouldn’t have to change their worldview.\n\nChoosing Barabbas didn’t force the crowd to face their own sin. They could go on living their comfortable lives if they got rid of Jesus. Admitting that Christ is the true Son of God changes everything. It changes how we spend every moment of every day. It feels so much easier to just pat myself on the back and choose Barabbas—”look, I set the prisoner free!”\n\nI’ve got to stop choosing Barabbas! I don’t want to live the false life; I want to stand in the truth! I don’t need to be lord of the sabbath; I acknowledge that Christ is Lord. I choose Him instead of me.\n\nWhere in your life do you say, “Give me Barabbas?” Where do we resent Christ’s rightful intrusion into the comfortable areas of our lives?\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Debbie Eaton\n\nText: Luke 23:26, Mark 15:21, Matthew 16:24-25\n\nI can’t begin to count how many times I’ve taken what feels like the weight of the world on my shoulders. I do this in every area of life, from trying to control a situation or set of circumstances—like the stress of household finances or my child’s grades and school performance—to taking on friends’ hardships, ministry burdens, work projects, even justice issues as problems for me to solve. But life doesn’t work that way, does it?\n\nWe were never meant to carry the weight of the world on our shoulders. It cripples and disappoints, creating discouragement, sleepless nights, and emotional turmoil. Heaping this weight on ourselves bears anger, resentment, fear, anxiety, stress, comparison, and jealousy—and that awful feeling that we can’t be everything to everyone, even though we try and try and try. I am tired and worn out just writing this!\n\nThis kind of heavy living is not the way of our Lord. Jesus said this:\n\n“Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”\n\n– Matthew 11:28-30, NASB\n\nJesus knew we would live under the daily weight of our idols of self-entitlement and our illusions of control, trying to play savior to ourselves and others. He knew the burdens of life would have crushing effects, so He taught and challenged His disciples to follow His lead, practicing the disciplines that keep us in relationship with God.\n\nOn that Friday after being beaten, judged, and sentenced to death, Jesus walked the dusty road to His crucifixion. Simon of Cyrene experienced a divine interruption when he was pulled from the crowd to carry the cross. Jesus walked in front of him, and Simon kept his eyes on Jesus. He was not taking Jesus’ place; he was simply following Him.\n\nTo follow Jesus is to relinquish our attempts to be god and savior to others. It is trusting that God is in control and we are not. It is believing that Christ alone saves, and we, despite our best efforts, do not. It is accepting—and expecting—Jesus to interrupt your day to bring your focus back to Him. Friend, this is far easier to write than to live because it requires complete dependence, humility, trust in God and His Word. To be a disciple means having a heart to follow, learn from, and love Jesus as He teaches, directs, and shapes our character and response to life circumstances.\n\nWhen we fix our eyes on Jesus ….\n\nThe Bible becomes the sustaining nourishment for living life. (Psalm 1:1-2)\n\nInterruptions become divine appointments. (John 4:1-26)\n\nConfession turns to freedom. (Isaiah 1:18)\n\nQuiet time restores the unsettled soul. (Psalm 46:10)\n\nLoving one another is not fixing each other, but pointing to the Savior who heals, redeems, and forgives. (1 John 4:7-12, Hebrews 12:1-17)\n\nThe weight of life is transferred back to the only One who can bear the weight.\n\nAs we fix our eyes on Jesus, He will take on our heaviest burdens and use them to transform us to be more like Him, and others will see and witness His redemptive glory.\n\n“For it is the grace of Christ, and not our own virtue, that gives us the power to overcome the flesh and the world.”\n\n– Thomas a Kempis\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nGood morning, friends. Sundays at She Reads Truth are normally Weekly Truth days, where we as a community join in the important practice of memorizing scripture together. We do have a memory verse and lock screen for you today (it’s at the bottom of this post!), but we hope you’ll join us in reading the full passage in Matthew and reflecting on Christ’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem.\n\nText: Matthew 21:1-11, Revelation 7:9-12\n\nYou know what stinks about being human? Being human. We are limited creatures. We only know what we know. Sure, hindsight is 20/20, but when it comes to foresight, we can be blind as bats. We don’t know what’s on the next page until we get there to live it.\n\nPaul, in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, describes this as “seeing in a mirror dimly.” But, “when perfection comes,” Paul tells us we will see clearly—no longer linear, no longer partial, but complete!\n\nNow picture Jesus, both fully man and fully God, riding through the crowded street that day. He already saw the complete picture—beyond this Triumphal Entry—so He knew what this ride into the capital city really meant. He knew He was riding to His death at the hands of those who waved the palm branches that day.\n\nThe people cried “Hosanna”—a shout of adoration that was also the Hebrew word meaning “Oh, save now!” or “Please save!”.\n\nOnly Jesus knew the gravity of what the crowd was asking when they cried to Him, “Save us!”  And He rode on. He knew what had been and what was to come, and in love and obedience, He rode on.\n\nI wonder if, from His seat on that donkey, Jesus thought back to His mother Mary. She journeyed on a donkey, too, toward the most hope-filled moment the world has ever known. And here He was, riding toward the darkest moment in human history. Did He think back to her?\n\nOr maybe Jesus thought forward to that blessed day John describes in Revelation 7, when we will stand before Him in white robes as His Bride—all nations and tribes and colors and generations—waving palm branches once again, proclaiming that our salvation indeed comes from Him!\n\nWe don’t know; the Bible doesn’t tell us. He certainly knew all these things as He rode through the adoring crowds that day. And while it’s true we can’t know for sure what’s coming tomorrow or the next day the way Jesus can, we can confidently shout “Hosanna! Save us!” today, knowing He will and He did.\n\nHosanna in the highest! Salvation belongs to our God.  \n\nWe believe memorizing scripture is one of the best ways to carry the Word of our God with us wherever we go—to have God-breathed truth, instruction and reproof in our hearts and minds as we live unto Him each day.\n\nThis week we’ve chosen the crowd’s shout of worship and cry for salvation as Jesus rode into Jerusalem that Palm Sunday:\n\nBlessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!\n\n– Matthew 21:9b, ESV\n\nWrite this verse down—copy it twenty time if that helps! Post it on your mirror or at your desk, in your car or on the fridge—anywhere you’ll see it often. Save the image below as your phone’s lock screen so you can read these words of truth throughout the day.\n\nWe want to be a community that is intentional about scripture memorization. Will you join us?\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Luke 23:27-31, Psalm 56:8, Hosea 10:1-8\n\nI’d like to nominate elevators as one of the most awkward spaces on the planet. You can go through most days refusing to acknowledge other people exist if you want to, but step onto an occupied elevator and you’re stuck. You know the other person is there. They know you know they’re there. You know they know you know they’re there. So you have 3 choices: stare straight ahead (awkward), stare at your phone (still pretty awkward), or look at the person (super awkward).\n\nMost of us choose Option A.\n\nJesus could have easily gotten away with ignoring the women crying out to Him as He walked along the dusty road, beaten and nearly naked, making the painful journey to an awful death. Yet even more remarkable than the fact that He brought His eyes up met theirs, or that He spoke to them in the midst of His suffering, is what He chose to say:\n\nTurning to them, Jesus said, ‘Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and your children.” (Luke 23:28, HCSB)\n\nJesus shifts the object of the their sympathy and mourning from Him back to themselves.\n\nWhy does He do this? Who are these women to whom the suffering Christ delivers a gentle but stern warning in the most striking of circumstances?\n\nThe women are noted to be citizens of Jerusalem, a center of religion that fervently rejected Jesus of Nazareth. We aren’t told exactly why they are following Jesus in a situation when many of His own have turned away. Perhaps they recognized glimpses of the divine in His words and actions and were following as unofficial disciples. Or maybe, and probably most likely, they were simply “good” religious folks who pitied Jesus and lamented the extreme cruelty being shown an innocent man.\n\nMore important than the motive behind their mourning are these three simple-yet-profound facts about their brief encounter with Christ:\n\nHe sees their tears. Jesus looks up from His own pain to acknowledge theirs. Yes, He was the divine Son of God suffering for the sin of humankind, and yes, they were members of that sinful race. Nevertheless, Jesus sees their tears, just like He sees mine and yours (Psalm 56:8).\n\nHe acknowledges their sorrow but redirects it to the proper place. Jesus quotes the words of the prophet Hosea when He describes the enormity of the sorrow to come for those who reject Him. In Hosea chapter 10, the people of God respond to fruitfulness and blessing not by turning toward God but turning toward themselves and their false gods. The consequences of this separation from God are severe—so severe that the people cry out for death to swallow them in their misery.\n\nJesus’ warning to the women on the Via Dolorosa that day was not an empty threat; it was the compassionate prophesy of a loving Savior who knows the natural way of a soul separated from the Father. I like commentator Matthew Henry’s explanation of Christ’s response when he says, “Let us weep, not for him (Jesus), but for our own sins, and the sins of our children, that were the cause of his death; and weep for fear (such were the tears here prescribed) of the miseries we shall bring upon ourselves, if we slight his love, and reject his grace.”\n\nBut Jesus does not leave the daughters of Jerusalem with a look and a warning that day. Which brings us to glorious #3—\n\nHe answers their grief with the ultimate display of love. The God who sees our every tear, who knows every hope and pain from whence they come, is the God who walked bruised and bleeding up the hill of obedience, called Calvary, and gave His very life to purchase our pardon. As NT Wright puts it, “The cross is the place where, and the means by which, God loved us to the uttermost.”\n\nThe God who views our tears as so precious that He keeps record of them in His book is the same God who says, “Don’t weep for me. Weep for yourselves.” For we are the sinful ones, Sisters, and He is all-holy. But through Christ’s work on the Cross, we are hidden in Him and brought eternally and indelibly near to God (Colossians 3:3). Thanks be to God!\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Isaiah 53:4-6, Luke 23:33-38\n\nIn college, every older student I talked to gave me the same advice: whatever you do, don’t take Media Law. After a series of unfortunate events we’ll call “Requirements For Graduation,” I found myself gazing through my non-prescription lenses at my professor, who passionately spoke of famous court cases, the difference between slander and libel, and the details of his recent inner-ear surgery.\n\nIt was also in this class that I learned if I had kept up my childhood behavior, I’d basically be a criminal by now. (I’m now realizing that’s probably not something I want taken out of context. Let’s just keep that between me and you, ok? Ok.)\n\nYou see, I was on the fast track to breaking every copyright law in the book, which, yes, Dr. Collins, I read cover to cover. Growing up, I rewrote my favorite books to include myself in them. It wasn’t enough to feel like I knew a character; I needed the character to know me. I adjusted all of my favorite plotlines to include a spunky, curly-haired little girl who, of course, always had something to do with the happily ever after.\n\nMaybe you didn’t spend your childhood the same way, but I feel safe in saying that a good majority of us would jump at the opportunity to inject ourselves into our favorite stories.\n\nIn the simplest of terms, I came to faith the same way. I savored words of Truth for many years, but it wasn’t until I realized my name was already intertwined in The Gospel Story that I began to understand it. I’d figured I really was a sinner—by birth, inheritance, or association—but when I realized I’m an active sinner by trade, everything changed.\n\nI assume not many joyfully proclaim, “I’M A SINNER!!!,” in the middle of a school cafeteria, but I did, and I still remember the giddiness I felt upon being a part of the story.\n\nThe funny thing about this realization, as we’ve revisited during this Lenten season, is that my sinful nature is the very thing that should kick me out of the plotline for good. Instead, Jesus shows up, asking us to lean in a little closer and see how He’s written our own hearts into the story.\n\nLet’s settle in and take in the scene of today’s reading for a moment: two criminals have just been crucified, and Jesus is up next. It’s a climactic chain of events headed for the turning point, but then the focus shifts to the most unlikely of subjects— us.\n\n“Father, forgive them.”\n\n“Father, forgive [your name goes here].”\n\nAnd here’s where the story twists unlike any I could have written for myself. Honestly, I’m tempted to take my forgiveness and run for the hills, because things are getting intense and I’m afraid the casting of my role is a mistake.\n\nBut friends, we weren’t written out of the story. We’re still front and center.\n\nLike John MacArthur points out, “The forgiveness [Jesus] extended on the cross to those who put him to death is the same forgiveness he extends to sinners today.” His grace is specific for you and specific for me. Being the object of Christ’s love is the biggest role we’ll ever play—a role of a deep recognition and intimate knowledge, created by our Heavenly Father for us to fill. It isn’t until we view the story from our assigned places that we allow ourselves to see His forgiveness as a gift of personalized mercy.\n\nBecause of the sacrifice of the Son and the forgiveness of the Father, you and I have a place in this story—in The Story. May we continue to walk in the narrative of grace penned with us in mind.\n\nKaitlin Wernet is a Carolina girl who now plants her feet in Tennessee as the Community Coordinator for She Reads Truth.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Luke 23:32-33, 39-43, Mark 15:27-32, Isaiah 53:12\n\nIt’s become a standard part of my day now. Every afternoon, around 5:15, I take my place in the slow-moving right hand lane of I-65 North, and I repent.\n\nThe She Reads Truth office is a solid 50-minute drive from my house in light traffic, so on the way home it’s a totally different monster. There’s a section of road on 65 North, a mile or so preceding the exits to the 440 bypass, where I am daily and rather begrudgingly reminded I’m a sinner. It’s like God gives me a glimpse, via Nashville’s going-home traffic, of the filthy soot of sin that lines the edges of my heart like a chimney. I’m a new woman in Christ, God’s Word says (2 Cor. 5:17), but there’s still plenty of the “old woman” tendencies sticking around to cause a ruckus.\n\nIt’s not a road rage thing; it’s much more subtle for me. I sit in my white minivan, with my satellite radio and calm demeanor, letting the occasional driver from the lane left of mine squeeze in front of me. And in my head, I silently make two lists of people: the Nice Ones, those who get into the far right lane as early as possible to wait their turn for the I-440 East on-ramp, and the Rotten Ones, who take advantage of the lighter traffic in the left lanes to speed by us patient, orderly folk and then dart over in front of us at the last possible minute. I give an annoyed grumble and say condescending things to them in my head, while secretly wondering how much time this strategy shaves off their commute.\n\nAnd there’s the rub: I sin when I judge the Rotten Ones and think myself better than them. And I sin when I stay in the left lane longer than I ought, playing innocent when I’m the one needing to sneak a notch or two to the right. I sin when I’m convinced my schedule is more important than theirs, that these hundreds of humans traveling the interstate are just characters in my story instead of their own.\n\nI’m a sinner. A sinner who has a LOT of time to think on her drive home from work.\n\nWe do this, don’t we? We organize people into lists in our head—who’s kind and who’s not, who’s selfless and who’s selfish, who’s a hard worker and who’s lazy, who we’d like to hang out with and who we’d like to avoid.\n\nWhen it comes to who among us is entitled to God’s love, we’re all on the Not Worthy list.\n\nThe Worthy list is made up of only one name: Jesus.\n\nAnd it would stay this way forever, were it not for the Cross.\n\nThe Cross is the sacred place where Jesus—Son of God, Worthy Lamb, the Sinless One—is “numbered with the transgressors.” He is placed on the list of those deserving God’s holy wrath, taking the death due their sin— our sin. Christ becomes our substitute, exchanging His righteousness for our sinfulness.\n\nBecause of Jesus—and only Jesus—we are forgiven, our unworthiness erased. Because of Him, we have have been made worthy, our names permanently placed on the list of those held forever close to our holy, loving God, never again to be separated from Him.\n\nWhether you’ve been in the lane of faith and repentance for miles or you squeezed over at the last minute, God’s grace is effective for you.\n\nYou, daughter of God who puts her trust in Jesus—your name is on the Worthy list. And it cannot, will not be erased.\n\n“Who can be afraid of one who is written in the same list with us? Surely we may come boldly to Him, and confess our guilt. He who is numbered with us cannot condemn us. Was He not put down in the transgressor’s list that we might be written in the red roll of the saints? He was holy, and written among the holy; we were guilty, and numbered among the guilty; He transfers His name from yonder list to this black indictment, and our names are taken from the indictment and written in the roll of acceptance, for there is a complete transfer made between Jesus and His people. All our estate of misery and sin Jesus has taken; and all that Jesus has comes to us.”\n\n– C.H. Spurgeon\n\n\n\n ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Debbie Eaton\n\nText: Psalm 22:18, John 19:23-27\n\nI rarely find myself at the movies these days, but I was invited by some friends to go and see the new, updated Cinderella movie and loved it. It was fun to see all the little girls at the theater, dressed up in their beautiful blue gowns, dreaming of what it would be like to live the fairy tale. The scenery in the movie was beautiful, the costumes were stunning, and the story vividly illustrated the power of kindness, love, courage, and forgiveness.\n\nMost of us don’t live a fairy tale of ball gowns and glass slippers, but the broader storyline is one we can relate to. Our real life exposes the juxtaposition of cruelty and kindness, harshness and compassion, hate and love, good and evil.\n\nI can’t image the depth of emotion Jesus’ mother must have experienced, seeing her son— the Son of God—hanging in the balance of life and death. She watched as the four Roman soldiers mocked Jesus and divided up His outer garments, the seamless tunic she may have made with her own hands being raffled off. Death is hard enough to look upon, but to witness such horrible torture, mockery, betrayal, and hate is difficult to stomach or even imagine. Yet, in those moments of extreme suffering, Jesus models once again the power of love, forgiveness, and grace.\n\nThe soldiers concerned themselves with things that don’t last—His garments—missing the immense display of love happening right in front of them. While they cast lots for His belongings, Jesus spoke to His dear mother for the last time. He saw her grief, and before His last breath, He transferred her care to His beloved disciple and friend, John. Jesus’ love for His mother stood in contrast to the mockery of those who hated Him—a reminder that we are known, seen and loved by God, even in the most painful and humiliating of circumstances.\n\nWe tend to value material things in this life, things that threaten to bring out the worst in us. Like those Roman soldiers, we trust what is temporal, covering ourselves with false garments—pride, fear, even hatred—that harden and betray our hearts. These worldly concerns distract us from looking up to see the Father’s great display of love for us.\n\nSisters, let us cast away our false garments and put on His garments of grace, compassion, and love available to us through Christ’s work on the Cross. Only in Him will we find eternal peace, hope and joy.\n\n \n\n \n\n",

It is perhaps the most bittersweet day of the year, but somehow, in the darkness, the “sweetness” is harder to find.\n\nHave you read through today’s passages yet? If you haven’t, I’d love if you’d do that first. Today we’ll sit in three gospel accounts of Christ’s crucifixion. Allow your heart to enter the text and ask the Holy Spirit to quiet distractions as you give ear to this sacred narrative.\n\n.   .    .\n\nDo you feel the weight of what you just read? It’s hard to read without deep sighs and even tears, isn’t it? The reality of a real man—my God—enduring what He did. It makes me painfully uncomfortable. Yet, as I read these words, I’ve never felt so deeply loved.\n\nChrist’s final words came with His dying breath—”It is finished.” And it was.\n\nHe bore the wrath of the one, true, holy God against sin—wrath that was due to literally anyone and everyone but Him. And it was finally over. His death completed the work of salvation for His people. It was truly finished then, and it still is.\n\nIt is finished. Complete.\n\nAnd hear this today—really hear it: Because it is finished, there is nothing that any one of us can contribute to Jesus’ work on the Cross to bring us any closer to salvation.  \n\nLet’s worship the One who was wounded for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities. As we observe this holy day of sacrifice for salvation, let’s remember the chastisement that brought peace for you and me, and receive the healing that comes to us from the stripes He bore.\n\n“So then, as through one trespass there is condemnation for everyone, so also through one righteous act there is life-giving justification, for everyone. For just as through one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous.”\n\nRomans 5:18,19, HCSB\n\nIt is finished, friends.\n\nThanks be to God.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Be Thou My Vision",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Proverbs 29:18, Philippians 3:7-11, Colossians 3:1-3, Hebrews 12:1-2\n\nI had a favorite teacher in junior high and high school named Mr. Twining. I remember a surprising number of details about Mr. Twining for his time as my “Critical Thinking” (chess) teacher and all the years he led me through Saxon Algebra. I remember his thick, sausage-y fingers that were almost always covered in a bit of a dark substance. “Wal-nuts!” he would answer with enthusiasm when we asked him why his hands were so dirty. Dude loved to crack walnuts.\n\nI remember his wild white tuft of hair that sometimes stuck straight up when he was feeling particularly passionate about perpendicular angles, and the way he wouldn’t throw away a small piece of chalk—rolling it around in his hands and wildly writing formulas on the chalkboard until it dissolved into an exhausted cloud of chalk dust. It’s funny the little details we remember about people in our lives.\n\nYou know what else I will never forget about Mr. Twining? Whether he was teaching us “Protect your bishops!” in chess class or working through an awful problem in pre-calculus, nearly every day at the start of class he would announce, as he also scrawled on the chalkboard with his tiny piece of chalk, “WITHOUT A VISION, THE PEOPLE WILL PERISH!”\n\nIt wasn’t until much later that I understood this was not just a way to get us to show our work or win a chess match—this was Biblical! (Proverbs 29:18) In any event, it stuck with me. You can’t just wildly move your pawns around the chessboard without a plan and hope it works out. And definitely don’t start working a math problem without knowing where you’re headed. We all need a vision.\n\nThat was enough for me when I was eighteen. My “vision” at the time was pretty straightforward: get married, be an interior designer, have babies, maybe live in one of those cute brownstones in downtown Chicago. But true vision, as it turns out, is less strategy and more heartbeat. It’s less “rook takes queen” and more “the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord” (Philippians 3:8). My endgame didn’t reach much beyond this side of Heaven.\n\nI don’t pretend to think my heart has fully matured in this area—I know it hasn’t!—but I do see the Lord faithfully teaching me to “delight in the law of God in my inner being” (Hebrews 7:22). And when I set my heart on new marble countertops, the Holy Spirit reminds me of the lasting richness that comes from “setting my mind on things above” (Colossians 3:2).\n\nIt’s like when you’re learning to drive, and the inevitably awkward driving instructor nervously and repeatedly reminds you as you weave down the road (and take a few curves on two wheels, in my case…): cast your gaze as far as possible in the direction you want to go, and you’ll just naturally drive straighter. Also, safer.\n\nI think this is why I love the hymn “Be Thou My Vision” so much. The author isn’t interested in anything short of Jesus. There’s no glancing to the right or to the left—no weaving from side to side. And when we sing this song-prayer ourselves, we call on the Lord to be our vision, our wisdom, our true Word, our battle Shield, our Dignity and Delight—our One Thing and our All Things.\n\nWhen we ask God to be our “best thought,” our “great Father,” “soul’s Shelter” and our “high Tower”—that’s when strategy falls quickly to the wayside and we march to the beat of a heart that longs for Heaven.\n\nFriends, Proverbs 29:18 is absolutely right (and, I suppose, so was Mr. Twining): without a vision, the people will perish. We can laugh about the reality that we could lose at chess, not get our Chicago brownstone, or run our car off the road if we don’t have a proper vision, but the greater Truth outlasts all of these things, and the risk is much greater: without a vision, we will most certainly perish.\n\nAs believers, let our vision be simply this: “that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.” (Philippians 3:10-11)\n\n“Therefore…let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith”\n\n– Hebrews 12:1-2\n\n (hymn artwork by Patrick Laurent of Quiet Boy Studio!)\n\nBE THOU MY VISION\n\nby Dallan Forgaill, 8th century \n\n(translated by Eleanor H. Hull and versified by Mary E. Byrne)\n\nBe Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;\n\nNaught be all else to me, save that Thou art.\n\nThou my best Thought, by day or by night,\n\nWaking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.\n\nBe Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;\n\nI ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;\n\nThou my great Father, I Thy true son;\n\nThou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.\n\nBe Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight;\n\nBe Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight;\n\nThou my soul’s Shelter, Thou my high Tower:\n\nRaise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.\n\nRiches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise,\n\nThou mine Inheritance, now and always:\n\nThou and Thou only, first in my heart,\n\nHigh King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.\n\nHigh King of Heaven, my victory won,\n\nMay I reach Heaven’s joys, O bright Heaven’s Sun!\n\nHeart of my own heart, whatever befall,\n\nStill be my Vision, O Ruler of all.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Luke 12:4-7, Matthew 6:25-34; Psalm 91:1-16, John 14:1-4\n\nWe have a photo of my family from a few years ago, on the day my dad came home from a long hospital stay. He sits wearily but happily in his recliner, wearing a plaid flannel shirt and an oxygen tube, and the group of us is gathered, standing, around him. It’s one of my favorites.\n\nWe’re all smiling in that picture—each and every one of us. It was a happy day for our family, though “happy” is not exactly the word I’d use to describe that time in our lives. It was a hard season—harder than I care to remember most of the time. We were terrified, facing death together for the first time in such an intimate way. Making it from one day to the next was an overwhelming chore. Even so, the season was somehow undergirded with a steady, pulsing joy. The word “supernatural” doesn’t often escape my lips, but that’s only the way I know to describe the peace that covered us. It was peace that passes understanding.\n\nI love Civilla Martin’s hymn, “His Eye Is On The Sparrow,” because it so beautifully embodies this mysterious juxtaposition of circumstance and joy. The words of the refrain are so enthusiastic and certain! “I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free! His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.” But the melody is somber, almost haunting.\n\nThe lyrics speak truth—our lives are in God’s careful, constant care.\n\nThe melody sings reality—life can be oh so hard.\n\nThis collision of condition and joy is what inspired Mrs. Martin to write the hymn in the first place. She and her husband were traveling in New York in the early 1900’s, when they befriended a couple named the Doolittles. Mrs. Doolittle had been bedridden for nearly 20 years, and her husband was wheelchair bound. Still, their disposition was bright and hopeful, enough that the Martins asked them the simple question: Why are you so happy? Mrs. Doolittle’s reply became the heart of the soon-to-be refrain: “His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.”*\n\nI just paused my writing to look up the word “happy” in the dictionary. Merriam-Webster defines it as “feeling pleasure and enjoyment because of your life, situation, etc.”\n\nI don’t know about you, but belting out “I siiiiing becaaaaause I feel pleasure about my situation!” just doesn’t ring true. If I look at my tangible circumstances—my struggles, my uncertainties, all the ways I feel I’m failing at all the things—happiness hardly seems to fit. But if I look to Jesus—to the promises of His Word and the glory of His cross—a holy joy begins to hum underneath the sound of earthly sorrow.\n\nWhen I turn my ear away from temporary troubles—real and painful though they are—and turn toward the Savior, I can hear the sure and steady song of redemption.\n\nIt’s the song my family heard that day as we gathered around my dad, laughing at our lack of camera-timer savvy. It’s the song the Doolittles sang as they chose joy in a life most of us would pity. It’s the song that has played from the beginning of the Gospel Story, when God made a covenant with His children to carry them close and bring them Home.\n\n“Because he loves me,” says the Lord, “I will rescue him;\n\nI will protect him, for he acknowledges my name\n\nHe will call on me, and I will answer him;\n\nI will be with him in trouble,\n\nI will deliver him and honor him.\n\nWith long life I will satisfy him\n\nand show him my salvation.”\n\n– Psalm 91:14-16, NIV\n\n*source: cyberhymnal.org\n\nHIS EYE IS ON THE SPARROW\n\nby Civilla D. Martin, 1905\n\nWhy should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come,\n\nWhy should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home,\n\nWhen Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He:\n\nHis eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;\n\nHis eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.\n\nRefrain\n\nI sing because I’m happy,\n\nI sing because I’m free,\n\nFor His eye is on the sparrow,\n\nAnd I know He watches me.\n\n“Let not your heart be troubled,” His tender word I hear,\n\nAnd resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears;\n\nThough by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see;\n\nHis eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;\n\nHis eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.\n\nRefrain\n\nWhenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,\n\nWhen songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,\n\nI draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free;\n\nHis eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;\n\nHis eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.\n\nRefrain\n\n",

I wrote a new melody to his four stanzas that afternoon, and these words have been an arresting companion for me in many changing seasons since that day.\n\nYour mercy, my God.\n\nThis morning, I was heavy with sleep when my double alarms went off at 6:00 and 6:08. I was slow-moving to get out of bed, having been awake during the night thinking about my kids, their school progress, my work schedule and the intersection of all those life forces. And still that sun came up again today. The faithful mercies of God—they come every morning, whether I am bleary-eyed or bright. When the sun is hidden behind winter, overcast clouds, still this mercy, this morning is new. Still, the sun rises.\n\nToday, His mercy is coming. I am reminded as I pray those words with my kids in the backseat on the way to school—His mercy is already here.\n\nWithout your sweet mercy, I could not live here.\n\nMercy is God giving us what we need when we don’t deserve an ounce of goodness. We can’t earn it. It’s a bold expectation, appealing for mercy when I don’t have anything measurable to contribute or to earn for myself. I can’t bargain with a Holy God. My appeal for grace is only and always Jesus.\n\nSome days we see a quick answer to yesterday’s prayers. Some days we decidedly get the opposite of what we asked for. Some days, in the silence, we are just asked to wait. Most days are like that, I think.\n\nI can say sometimes, like St. Paul, that I have learned to be content in lots of situations. But my contentment is fleeting. It slips through my fingers. And gratitude is both a practice and a gift to be received.\n\nYour goodness, I own.\n\nHere, John’s hymn proclaims another bold expectation. In the midst of our failings and fears, we are the recipients of LOVE by a fiercely loving God—an obliging God, even. He gives Himself to us again and again. It is as if we are the receiving address where He sends and supplies His goodness daily. I love the phrase in the Anglican communion liturgy that says, “For it is Your property always to have mercy.” Mercy is a demonstration of God’s abundant nature. In Philippians 2, we are reminded of how Jesus humbled Himself in obedience to the Father’s will. His faithfulness toward us is measurable by His provision—daily bread, of every variety.\n\n“In him and by him and for him, all things hold together” (Colossians 1:16). In all things, Jesus holds the world together—the rhythms of our families, the rhythm of the sunrise, and everything in creation, held together by the sheer magnetic and dynamic force of His mercy.  Mercy for you. Mercy for me. Mercy for the world.\n\n________\n\nTHY MERCY, MY GOD, IS THE THEME OF MY SONG\n\nby John Stocker, 1776\n\nThy mercy, my God, is the theme of my song,\n\nThe joy of my heart. and the boast of my tongue;\n\nThy free grace alone, from the first to the last,\n\nHath won my affections, and bound my soul fast.\n\nWithout Thy sweet mercy I could not live here;\n\nSin would reduce me to utter despair;\n\nBut, through Thy free goodness, my spirits revive,\n\nAnd He that first made me still keeps me alive.\n\nThy mercy is more than a match for my heart,\n\nWhich wonders to feel its own hardness depart;\n\nDissolved by Thy goodness, I fall to the ground,\n\nAnd weep to the praise of the mercy Ive found.\n\nGreat Father of mercies, Thy goodness I own,\n\nAnd the covenant love of Thy crucified Son;\n\nAll praise to the Spirit, Whose whisper divine\n\nSeals mercy, and pardon, and righteousness mine.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "O The Deep, Deep Love of Jesus",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Romans 5:6-11, Romans 8:31-39, Hebrews 6:19\n\nI am not a great singer.\n\nIn middle school, I decided to make up for mediocre pitch and air support with huge confidence and volume. Instead of being the best singer in the choir, I’m the most enthusiastic. You’ve probably sat next to me in church and thought, “Well, she sure is enjoying herself.”\n\nOnce you start to take joy in singing you can really go to town with the harmony. And when I learned to read harmony, well, I was unstoppable. Or is it insufferable? Hard to know.\n\nIn college I had a great teacher who taught us to love the rich theological heritage of church music. We all started singing these dear hymns and songs together, and as we learned them, the words and melodies became the background and texture of our college life. Adorable as it sounds, those hymns really were a touchstone for us.\n\nMy hands-down favorite from that season is “O The Deep, Deep Love of Jesus.” The harmony is so satisfying to sing, and the whole song rumbles with robust enthusiasm. The hymn writer, Samuel Trevor Francis, didn’t always rumble with robust enthusiasm. When he tells the story of his life, he remembers walking along the Thames in London as a young man and wishing he could throw himself in the water and end it all.\n\nTo varying degrees, I think a lot of us have moments of wanting to give up. And not just because “Thames” is hard to pronounce (FYI- it’s “tems”). That college girl singing hymns couldn’t imagine letting go of life; there was still so much joy to be squeezed out of it! But years later, when all the babies were crying and all the diapers needed changing, life looked less plump with promise to me.\n\nSamuel went on to live a very long and gospel-driven life. Good for him, right? Well, I believe that God rescued him. Samuel had a bad spell and he longed for the numbing embrace of water all around him, but instead God gave him love—love “rolling as a mighty ocean in its fullness” over him!\n\nWe’ve all heard the lies that Samuel heard in his head. Life can be the worst. Let’s just stop here for a minute: I hear you. I read your stories, too. Some of you have been kicked in the gut too many times for it to be funny anymore.\n\nBut I have to believe that the solid, reliable, and deep love of Jesus that surrounds me is better than the ephemeral lies swirling in my head. The Bible promises that He is “a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain.” (Hebrews 6:19)\n\nI get super car sick when I’m the passenger, and a few years ago I was riding with my sister and feeling like I was for sure going to lose it. I put my head down, rocked back and forth, and sang this song to myself. After the trip was over, everyone had a good laugh about how I’m the crazy singing lady.\n\nBut isn’t that what we all need sometimes? Sometimes we just need to tuck our heads low, forget about everything else, and hold on to the one thing we know to be true. Shut everything else out for just a minute today, and hold on to the “deep, deep love of Jesus—vast, unmeasured, boundless, free.”\n\nI pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ.\n\n– Ephesians 3:17-18\n\nO THE DEEP DEEP LOVE OF JESUS\n\nby Samuel Trevor Francis, 1875\n\nO the deep, deep love of Jesus,\n\nVast, unmeasured, boundless, free!\n\nRolling as a mighty ocean\n\nIn its fullness over me!\n\nUnderneath me, all around me,\n\nIs the current of Thy love\n\nLeading onward, leading homeward\n\nTo Thy glorious rest above!\n\nO the deep, deep love of Jesus,\n\nSpread His praise from shore to shore!\n\nHow He loveth, ever loveth,\n\nChangeth never, nevermore!\n\nHow He watches o’er His loved ones,\n\nDied to call them all His own;\n\nHow for them He intercedeth,\n\nWatcheth oer them from the throne!\n\nO the deep, deep love of Jesus,\n\nLove of every love the best!\n\nTis an ocean vast of blessing,\n\nTis a haven sweet of rest!\n\nO the deep, deep love of Jesus,\n\nTis a heaven of heavens to me;\n\nAnd it lifts me up to glory,\n\nFor it lifts me up to Thee!\n\n",

    "devo_title": "O For A Thousand Tongues to Sing",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Revelation 5:11-13 , Isaiah 61:1-4\n\nI’ve always envied people who know their “spiritual birthday”—the day that marks the moment in time they received Jesus as Savior. My faith journey was not so black and white, and I never knew what to say when the topic came up in youth group or college Bible studies.\n\nCharles Wesley did not have this problem. The famous Methodist minister was captured by the beauty of the Gospel on May 21, 1738—at 8:45pm, to be exact. He describes that his heart was “strangely warmed” and that the Holy Spirit “chased away the darkness of [his] unbelief.” Exactly a year later, in 1739, Wesley penned nineteen stanzas (!!) of the hymn we now call “O For A Thousand Tongues to Sing.” He wrote it to commemorate the first anniversary of his conversion, inspired by missionary Peter Boehler’s statement: “Had I a thousand tongues, I would praise Christ Jesus with all of them.”\n\nIt’s a great story, right? Here’s the craziest part: Charles Wesley had been an active, ordained, teaching and preaching member of the church for nearly two decades by the time he wrote this hymn. He and his brother John even led a missionary excursion to America in 1735, three years before their heart-warming gospel transformation. The Wesleys had an abundance of knowledge and a host of good deeds, but they discovered they didn’t have faith. They needed to believe.\n\nSome 250 years later, in 1999, a naive and well-meaning college girl named Amanda went on her own overseas adventure, to carry the Gospel to the youth on the streets of Wales. Her heart had been warmed and she did know Jesus, but she mistook salvation as a commodity to be sold rather than Good News to be shared. I have a journal from the time I spent in Wales, and I read through it just the other day. I read the names of young people I met—kids not much younger than I was at the time—and how desperately I wanted them to know Jesus. I look back on that experience with fondness and regret. Rather than handing those teenagers a sales pitch and a tract, I wish so badly I would have shared my heart.\n\nThe worship of a changed heart is the best evidence of the Gospel. No other case for Christ comes close, no matter how well-rehearsed. This is not to diminish the importance of teaching and preaching—it was during a sermon that Charles Wesley first believed! But following Jesus is not a decision of logic; it is a determination of the heart—a determination that only comes by grace through faith when the Holy Spirit softens that heart to see and receive the beauty of Christ and opens our lips to sing His praise.\n\nWe hear the words of a grace-changed heart in this beloved hymn. Wesley practically gushes about his Lord!\n\nJesus! The Name that charms our fears,\n\nThat bids our sorrows cease,\n\nTis music in the sinner’s ears,\n\nTis life, and health, and peace.\n\n“The glories of my God and King, the triumphs of His grace”—that’s what I wish I would have shared with those scared, seeking kids on the streets of Wales all those years ago. Rather than sell the transactional Jesus I’d created, I wish I would have simply sung the praises of my Savior: He brings me peace. He gives me life. He trumps all my fears and sorrows.\n\nI wish I had looked Nikola and Scott and Chris and all the others straight in the eye and said,\n\nI was a prisoner in a cell of my own making, and Jesus set me free.\n\nWe want so badly to convince the world of the beauty and hope of our Lord, but only God can warm the heart. The Creator of heaven and earth does not need our defense—He deserves our praise. The Rescuer of hearts is not made more beautiful by my salesmanship—He is regarded as beautiful in my worship.\n\nSisters, may the God whose grace has triumphed over us “assist us to proclaim” His praise to the poor and the brokenhearted, to the captives and those who mourn, to sing with all the hosts of heaven:\n\n“To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb\n\nbe blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!”\n\n(Revelation 5:13b, ESV)\n\nO FOR A THOUSAND TONGUES TO SING\n\nby Charles Wesley, 1749\n\nO for a thousand tongues to sing\n\nMy great Redeemer’s praise,\n\nThe glories of my God and King,\n\nThe triumphs of His grace!\n\nMy gracious Master and my God,\n\nAssist me to proclaim,\n\nTo spread through all the earth abroad\n\nThe honors of Thy Name.\n\nJesus! The Name that charms our fears,\n\nThat bids our sorrows cease;\n\nTis music in the sinner’s ears,\n\nTis life, and health, and peace.\n\nHe breaks the power of canceled sin,\n\nHe sets the prisoner free;\n\nHis blood can make the foulest clean,\n\nHis blood availed for me.\n\nHe speaks, and, listening to His voice,\n\nNew life the dead receive,\n\nThe mournful, broken hearts rejoice,\n\nThe humble poor believe.\n\nHear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,\n\nYour loosened tongues employ;\n\nYe blind, behold your Savior come,\n\nAnd leap, ye lame, for joy!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellie Holcomb\n\nThere is such beauty in singing His praises—not just in church, but in our dirty kitchens, with breaking hearts, in the middle of our unmet longings, or at the end of our weary days. Praise turns our hearts from ourselves toward the One we were made to adore—toward the One who adores us, to the One who was broken for us, and to the One from whom all blessings flow.\n\n“Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.” \n\n– Psalm 150:6\n\nOver and over in Scripture, there are commands and exhortations to give God praise. Praise rings out all over the Psalms. Paul tells us to “rejoice always” (Phil 4:4). God asks us to praise Him, even when our hearts are heavy. The Lord’s Prayer opens with praise: “Our Father, in heaven, hallowed be Thy name” (Matt 6:19).\n\nThere’s a lovely mystery to rejoicing always, to choosing to praise God in every moment. How on earth is that possible? Always?\n\nWe have walked through some seriously heartbreaking circumstances with dear friends and family over the past few months. Praising God feels like the opposite of what I want do most of the time, especially in the middle of such sadness. But as I direct my heart back to the Cross and the empty grave, I begin to remember that we do have this Living Hope, even in the middle of the most desperate circumstances.\n\nI don’t know how to rejoice always, but I do know that every time I remember who He is—and how He gave Himself up for us so that we could know wholeness—something shifts in my heart, even when it’s breaking.\n\nSo let’s listen to the invitations and encouragement all throughout Scripture today, dear sisters. Let’s raise our voices as creatures here below and let them mingle with the saints that have gone before us and with the heavenly hosts, to give praise to the Author of every blessing and to the One who gives us a Living Hope, even on our darkest days.\n\n \n\n \n\nTHE DOXOLOGY\n\nby Thomas Ken, 1674\n\nPraise God, from Whom all blessings flow;\n\nPraise Him, all creatures here below;\n\nPraise Him above, ye heavenly host;\n\nPraise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\n\nAmen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Romans 3:21-26, Luke 5:27-32, 1 Timothy 1:15\n\nJesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.\n\nI have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”\n\n– Luke 5:31-32, NIV\n\nMy husband Ryan hates to go to the doctor. Hates it. Would rather overpay on taxes while drinking room temperature coffee with sand in his teeth than find himself in the exam room.\n\nBut, this fall I finally took the bull by the horns and made a call to schedule some long-overdue health maintenance checks. Y’all, they didn’t even know his name. He wasn’t in their system. He’d never been seen by a doctor since we moved to Nashville more than eight years ago.\n\nOnce the dates were finally on the calendar, he was really sweating it. Ryan lost sleep for an entire week worrying that the doctor would uncover some terminal illness or lecture him like he was a child about regular well-checks and diet and exercise. He’d waited so long, it felt awkward to show up. He set up camp at the intersection of “ignorance is bliss” and “I can’t bear the judgment” and lived there for years.\n\nI laughed at him then and I still chuckle about it now—so silly to be afraid to be seen by a caretaker. But when I zoom out to a larger picture I realize that, in a lot of ways, I’m just the same in my relationship with my Caretaker.\n\nLord, could we please postpone the “examine my heart” prayer until I’ve got something worth shining your headlamp on?\n\nFather, I’m a mess right now. I promise you don’t want me walking around proclaiming your name – I’m a PR nightmare.\n\nGod, I don’t really know you very well, but I’d like to. Let me see if I can get my act together a bit, then let’s be friends!\n\nFriends, we are all sick with sin. Every one of us is diseased with iniquity. We hear each other saying, “I’m broken and guilty,” and we think to ourselves, “If only they knew – it’s me. I’m the worst.” We live in fear of shining a light on the very darkest parts of our hearts—afraid to whisper those dark parts by name, let alone hold them in our outstretched hands in plain sight of the One who bled and died to redeem them.\n\nJesus our Healer, says, “Come.” Yes, you are very sick, but that’s why I’m here!\n\nJesus our Justifier, says, “Come.” Child, you are ill, and I am the only One who can make you well.\n\nWe live in shame and fear, afraid to come into the light until we we know the Physician will be pleased with what He sees. We’re worried we’ve waited too long. The author of the hymn “Come, Ye Sinners” echoes Christ Himself when he says, don’t wait another minute!\n\n“If you tarry till you’re better, you will never come at all.”\n\n“Let not conscience make you linger,\n\nNot of fitness fondly dream;\n\nAll the fitness he requireth is to feel your need of him.”\n\nDo you need Him today, Sisters? Come to Him.\n\nAre you waiting to be better on your own? Come to Him.\n\nIn Him you will find not condemnation, but healing.\n\nCOME, YE SINNERS\n\nby Joseph Hart, 1759\n\nCome, ye sinners, poor and needy,\n\nWeak and wounded, sick and sore;\n\nJesus ready stands to save you,\n\nFull of pity, love and power.\n\nRefrain\n\nI will arise and go to Jesus,\n\nHe will embrace me in His arms;\n\nIn the arms of my dear Savior,\n\nO there are ten thousand charms.\n\nCome, ye thirsty, come, and welcome,\n\nGod’s free bounty glorify;\n\nTrue belief and true repentance,\n\nEvery grace that brings you nigh.\n\nRefrain\n\nCome, ye weary, heavy laden,\n\nLost and ruined by the fall;\n\nIf you tarry till you’re better,\n\nYou will never come at all.\n\nRefrain\n\nView Him prostrate in the garden;\n\nOn the ground your Maker lies.\n\nOn the bloody tree behold Him;\n\nSinner, will this not suffice?\n\nRefrain\n\nLo! th’incarnate God ascended,\n\nPleads the merit of His blood:\n\nVenture on Him, venture wholly,\n\nLet no other trust intrude.\n\nRefrain\n\nLet not conscience make you linger,\n\nNot of fitness fondly dream;\n\nAll the fitness He requireth\n\nIs to feel your need of Him.\n\nRefrain\n\n",

Something’s not right. So, I stop. And I take the time to gently restore each string to its right place so the song will be beautiful again.\n\nAnd, oh, how my heart needs tuning! I forget His goodness. I forget there are “streams of mercy, never ceasing.” I forget that I’m already accepted, covered, held, known, beloved. And when I forget that I’m His cherished daughter, I start hustling for my worth. Grasping for “good” as if I don’t already have access to the Giver of every good thing.\n\nProne to wander, Lord, I feel it.\n\nI’d never play a song with an out of tune guitar, but so often (too often) I am willing to live with a heart that is out of tune. Dissonant. Fearful. Discontent. Ashamed. All because I don’t take the time to restore my heart to its rightful place, to a place of gratitude for a Love that will never leave me.\n\nIt seems that our work as followers of Jesus is to remember. To sing His grace over and over. And because of what He did on the Cross, it’s a song that will never grow old. We can’t sing it too much or too loudly. We can’t wear that record out.\n\nWhile we were still sinners, Love gave Himself up for us, and walked out of the grave, so that we could taste the sweetness of mercy and belonging. That song is powerful. Lord, would you help us to sing it?\n\nI need this hymn. I need the truth that it carries.\n\nIt calls me back to remembering the Fount of every blessing.\n\nIt beckons me to raise up Ebenezer stones. Rocks to remember how God has been my helper. Rocks to remember our Rock.\n\nBecause I’ve got nothing if I don’t have Him. And we HAVE HIM. He stands with open arms, ready to transform our hearts if we’ll but hand them over. Bind us to Your side, Lord Jesus.\n\nWhat might happen if we invited Him to tune our hearts to sing His grace today?\n\n \n\nCOME, THOU FOUNT OF EVERY BLESSING\n\nRobert Robinson, 1735-1790 \n\nCome, thou Fount of every blessing,\n\ntune my heart to sing thy grace;\n\nstreams of mercy, never ceasing,\n\ncall for songs of loudest praise.\n\nTeach me some melodious sonnet,\n\nsung by flaming tongues above.\n\nPraise the mount! I’m fixed upon it,\n\nmount of thy redeeming love.\n\nHere I raise mine Ebenezer;\n\nhither by thy help I’m come;\n\nand I hope, by thy good pleasure,\n\nsafely to arrive at home.\n\nJesus sought me when a stranger,\n\nwandering from the fold of God;\n\nhe, to rescue me from danger,\n\ninterposed his precious blood.\n\nO to grace how great a debtor\n\ndaily I’m constrained to be!\n\nLet thy goodness, like a fetter,\n\nbind my wandering heart to thee.\n\nProne to wander, Lord, I feel it,\n\nprone to leave the God I love;\n\nhere’s my heart, O take and seal it,\n\nseal it for thy courts above.\n\n",

And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God… \n\n– Job 19:25-26, ESV\n\nThe last few years had been pretty terrible for the man. He and his wife, Anna, had 4 beautiful children—3 girls and a boy—when scarlet fever stole the life of their only son. The boy was just four years old.\n\nThe family was wealthy; he was a successful lawyer with influential friends. The year after his little boy died, the man invested a sizeable portion of their money in northern Chicago’s growing real estate market. A handful of months later, it was gone—the property and the family fortune destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\n\nBut it’s what came next that undid him.\n\nThe year was 1873, two years after the fire. He sent Anna and their children (there were 4 girls now, one born since the loss of their son) ahead to England for a family holiday. He stayed back on business with the plan of following shortly after. Only, something went terribly wrong. The ship wrecked with another in the Atlantic, and the girls perished at sea. A grieved Anna reached shore and sent her husband a telegram: “Survived alone.”\n\nSurvived alone.\n\nHave you ever felt that sorrow, Sister? Have you ever found yourself standing, lost and suddenly alone, in the wreckage of what was or what might have been?\n\nWe know our Redeemer lives. We believe it, even when we cannot feel it. Yet grief is thick and tangible and our bodies pain under its weight. Whatever and whomever we grieve, the emotions consume and toss us like ragdolls in the waves and we have no energy left to swim. And so we do the only thing we know to do: we give the grief back to God.\n\nWhen a broken Chicago businessman named Horatio Spafford sailed past the very spot on the Atlantic where his baby girls breathed their last, he offered up these words of worship to the God who presides over all the sorrows and the seas, to the One who has borne the whole of our grief and our sin:\n\nWhatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,\n\nIt is well, it is well with my soul.\n\nYes, Lord, haste the day where our faith shall be sight. And may be spend all our days until then offering you our joys, our grief, everything we are. Amen.\n\n\n\nIT IS WELL WITH MY SOUL\n\nHo­ra­tio G. Spaf­ford, 1873\n\nWhen peace, like a river, attendeth my way,\n\nWhen sorrows like sea billows roll;\n\nWhatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,\n\nIt is well, it is well, with my soul.\n\nRefrain\n\nIt is well, with my soul,\n\nIt is well, with my soul,\n\nIt is well, it is well, with my soul.\n\nThough Satan should buffet, though trials should come,\n\nLet this blest assurance control\n\nThat Christ has regarded my helpless estate,\n\nAnd hath shed His own blood for my soul.\n\nRefrain\n\nMy sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!\n\nMy sin, not in part but the whole,\n\nIs nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,\n\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!\n\nRefrain\n\nAnd Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,\n\nThe clouds be rolled back as a scroll;\n\nThe trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,\n\nEven so, it is well with my soul.\n\nRefrain\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Isaiah 43:1-3, Psalm 66:8-12, Deuteronomy 31:1-8\n\nIt is the Lord who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed.” \n\n– Deuteronomy 31:8, ESV\n\nI’ll be honest. With everything in me today I want to respond to these scriptures and this incredible hymn on a joyful, super-tidy level. But every time I sit down to write—even in the in-between when I’m avoiding writing—I sense the Lord showing me something I’m not sure I want to see. He’s asking me to share something I’m not sure I want to share.\n\nI don’t want to write about it because it’s so honest it hurts. It’s my sin and it’s ugly and who wants to air that out in public? But as I confess this to the Father, I feel Him nudging me to share some dark-but-now-forgiven parts of me with you, and I hope they may help you feel less alone and confident to repent, too.\n\nThe truth is, I have such a difficult time trusting people that my insecurity can be downright paralyzing. Just last week I spent two full days in a gridlock of fear—unable to function, unable to carry out any of my callings, just a mess of a puddle on the floor. (The opposite of free, you guys. The opposite of joyful.) I struggled with insecurity about the position He’s given me in She Reads Truth and as a writer, I felt ill-equipped to teach anyone anything about God’s precious Word, and I was absolutely terrified that somehow, some way, I would be betrayed or taken advantage of because I just didn’t know any better.\n\nThat’s a lot of honest for one paragraph. If it didn’t pain you to read it, it super pained me to write it. There are seasons when I carry a crippling fear of betrayal around like an old heavy suitcase strapped to my back, and it goes with me everywhere and keeps me from living life the way I’m called to live it. I’ve walked through a number of unspeakable betrayals as a child and as an adult, and I’m sure that’s a lot of why I struggle with this. I tried to tie a neat little bow around it for my husband just the other day, confidently summarizing that I can trust the Lord with abandon, it’s just people that make me crumble sometimes.\n\nBut you guys, it’s still fear. And when my worst case scenarios are played out in my head—or out loud for a friend—at the end of the game I’m never without my Jesus. So do I even really trust Him?\n\nIf I do trust God, then I have nothing to fear and I have every reason for joy. And the question “But what if I suffer?” instead becomes “What am I so afraid of?”\n\nCharles Spurgeon says it this way:\n\n“…if it shall come to pass that for Christ’s sake and the gospel’s you shall endure suffering in any shape, shrink not, but rejoice in the honour thus conferred upon you, that you are counted worthy to suffer with your Lord; and joy also in this – that your sufferings, your losses, and persecutions shall make you a platform, from which the more vigorously and with greater power you shall witness for Christ Jesus.”\n\nWe’re all a mess and we know it. We reason with each other that we trust God, we just don’t trust people—or vice versa. But our Savior lifts our lowered eyes to meet His and says, What are you so afraid of? I will not leave you or forsake you. That’s a promise.\n\nHOW FIRM A FOUNDATION\n\nRobert Keene, 18th century\n\nHow firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,\n\nIs laid for your faith in His excellent Word!\n\nWhat more can He say than to you He hath said,\n\nYou, who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?\n\nIn every condition, in sickness, in health;\n\nIn poverty’s vale, or abounding in wealth;\n\nAt home and abroad, on the land, on the sea,\n\nAs thy days may demand, shall thy strength ever be.\n\nFear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,\n\nFor I am thy God and will still give thee aid;\n\nI’ll strengthen and help thee, and cause thee to stand\n\nUpheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand.\n\nWhen through the deep waters I call thee to go,\n\nThe rivers of woe shall not thee overflow;\n\nFor I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,\n\nAnd sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.\n\nWhen through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie,\n\nMy grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;\n\nThe flame shall not hurt thee; I only design\n\nThy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.\n\nEven down to old age all My people shall prove\n\nMy sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;\n\nAnd when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn,\n\nLike lambs they shall still in My bosom be borne.\n\nThe soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose,\n\nI will not, I will not desert to its foes;\n\nThat soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,\n\nI’ll never, no never, no never forsake.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hebrews 4:15-16, 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, John 15:1-11\n\n“…apart from me you can do nothing.” – John 15:5b, NIV\n\nThe first time I can remember acknowledging feeling completely and utterly in need of Jesus — not just in theory or heart, but emotionally and physically “if you don’t come, Lord Jesus, I’m not gonna make it” in NEED of the Lord — was when my daughter was two years old.\n\nI adore my daughter. She is stubborn and kind and smart and just the right amount of crazy, and I’m in awe of the way God made her. But when she discovered the art of disobedience I thought it would be the death of me. We went head-to-head on a daily basis—me with my expectations and rules and her with her fearless, freakishly-strong toddler will—and more often than not I’d end up in tears.\n\nWhat was wrong with me? Why couldn’t I do this? Why was I so bad at patience and discipline and grace and having fun, and why was I so emotionally fragile that a two year old could push ALL MY BUTTONS?\n\nTo say this was a rough patch in my parenting career would be an understatement.\n\nOh, but that little girl taught me—teaches me!—what grace looks like. She offers it to me like candy, and I offer it back to her. We apologize a lot. We talk about how we want to love each other well and we ask Jesus to help us do that. We ask Jesus lots of things, actually.\n\nI ask Jesus to help me mother. I ask Jesus to help me listen to my friends and really love them. I ask Him to help me look strangers in the eye and really see them.\n\nI ask Jesus to care for all the people I love because there are so many I lose count and I don’t get to hug any of them as often as I wish I could. I ask Him to put a blanket of peace and comfort around my friends with achy hearts.\n\nI ask Jesus to fill in the gaps where I’ve been negligent. I ask Him to forgive me of the damage I’ve knowingly and unknowingly caused, to smooth it over with the holy spackle of His grace. I also ask Him to help me write true stories with odd metaphors.\n\nI ask Jesus for all the things, but I don’t ask Him enough.\n\n“Apart from me you can do nothing.” That’s what Jesus says about us in John 15:5. Do you hear the freedom in that today? You and I don’t have to manufacture our own goodness, our own enoughness. Everything good is from Him and for Him.\n\nThis hymn has always been one of my favorites, but this quote from author Annie Hawks sealed the deal.\n\n“One day as a young wife and mo­ther of 37 years of age, I was bu­sy with my reg­u­lar house­hold tasks. Sud­den­ly, I be­came so filled with the sense of near­ness to the Mast­er that, won­der­ing how one could live with­out Him, ei­ther in joy or pain, these words, ‘I Need Thee Ev­e­ry Hour,’ were ush­ered in­to my mind, the thought at once tak­ing full pos­sess­ion of me.”*\n\nIsn’t that typical of how God loves us? We’re busy doing life the best we can when God gently or not-so-gently nudges us to say, “I’m right here. Can’t you see? I’m what you need.”\n\nMay this hymn be the prayer of heart today and every day.\n\nI NEED THEE EVERY HOUR\n\nAnnie S. Hawks, 1872\n\nI need Thee every hour, most gracious Lord;\n\nNo tender voice like Thine can peace afford.\n\nRefrain\n\nI need Thee, O I need Thee;\n\nEvery hour I need Thee;\n\nO bless me now, my Savior,\n\nI come to Thee.\n\nI need Thee every hour, stay Thou nearby;\n\nTemptations lose their power when Thou art nigh.\n\nRefrain\n\nI need Thee every hour, in joy or pain;\n\nCome quickly and abide, or life is in vain.\n\nRefrain\n\nI need Thee every hour; teach me Thy will;\n\nAnd Thy rich promises in me fulfill.\n\nRefrain\n\nI need Thee every hour, most Holy One;\n\nO make me Thine indeed, Thou blessèd Son.\n\nRefrain\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nShe Reads Truth is truly honored to provide this study of biblical justice in collaboration with these special guest contributors: Gary A. Haugen, founder and CEO of International Justice Mission Bethany Hoang, Director of the Institute for Biblical Justice at IJM Jessica Honegger, founder of Noonday Collection Jennie Allen, author of Restless and Anything\n\n_______________________________\n\nFor the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification. – Romans 5:16b\n\nWe cannot begin a conversation about justice anywhere but at the cross of Jesus.  We want to talk about justice within the church and on a global scale. We struggle to understand the relationship among justice, vengeance and fairness. We want to restrain the crushing hand of the oppressor and extend the hand of mercy to widows and orphans. We want to know why the emphasis on justice seems to shift in the Bible, between the Old Testament law and the New Testament teachings of Jesus. We want to know why the people we love suffer—why the people God loves are hurting. We want to understand justice! The pursuit of justice changes lives and directs the course of history. It shapes families and shifts paradigms. Justice is a highly current conversation, and the pursuit of social justice occasionally finds biblical justice in the backseat.\n\nSo, what exactly is biblical justice? And why do we insist that this conversation must begin at the cross? We start here because the cross was The Great Inversion of Justice. The cross of Jesus is where justice and mercy kiss. It’s where Adam’s sinful curse is met with the New Adam’s sinless sacrifice, and the severe wrath and sovereign mercy of God bring the world to right, once and for all. The cross was the crucifixion of a sinless man, sentenced to death, shedding innocent blood, giving up His God-ness, becoming sin, and satisfying the world’s debt because of His great mercy.  So has God done an injustice by allowing the death of His righteous son? No, it is we who have done the injustice. Indeed, no greater injustice can be committed than that man would kill God.\n\nWe start at the cross because there is no place else to start. It is the place where our own slates were wiped clean—the place where Jesus paid it all and all to Him we owe. It is the place where we throw “deserve” and “fair” out the window because we realize what true justice would mean for any one of us. As followers of Christ, we cannot go forward in our conversation about justice on any basis but this:\n\nMy sin has sentenced me to death. Death is what I deserve. God in His mercy became sin —my sin— and took my death excruciatingly up Himself. Because of that, I owe Him my life.\n\nLet’s start here, Sisters. Each of us coming with her own experiences, her own hurts and joys—let’s stick our collective flag in the sand here, and let’s come back here every single day of this study. Let’s view each facet of justice through this cross-shaped lens. \n\nOver the next two weeks, we’ll read tons of scripture and share lots of ideas surrounding the topic of biblical justice. We’ll walk briefly through the role of justice in our relationship with God, our neighbor, and the world. The conversation is going to get hard, and we do not have all the answers. Even still, we believe the Bible has more than a lot to say about this topic that is part of the very heart and character of our God.\n\nIt may feel a bit like drinking from a fire hose at times (trust us—we feel the same way!), but our prayer is that, through these scripture passages and stories, we would be changed. That we would learn more about God and His fierce love for His children. That we would learn something new about ourselves and how we can actively pursue justice in our daily lives (because, we absolutely can!). That we would not feel paralyzed but rather empowered to join in the redemptive work God is doing today, in our own neighborhood and around the world. Will you join us?\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bethany Hoang\n\nText: Matthew 20:1-16, Psalm 146:5-9, Deuteronomy 16:18-20, Psalm 33:4-5\n\nJustice, and only justice, you shall follow, that you may live and inherit the land that the Lord your God is giving you.\n\n– Deuteronomy 16:20\n\n“Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen:\n\nto loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke,\n\nto set the oppressed free and break every yoke?”\n\n– Isaiah 58:6\n\nI’ll never forget the moment when I first encountered the part of Isaiah 58 that talks about breaking the chains of oppression and setting the captives free.\n\nIsaiah 58 first came into my life as a powerful statement of promise to me personally. If there was anything I longed for most at that point in my life, it was freedom. Freedom from the chains of my own sin that seemed to choke my spirit. Freedom from the sin of others that left me carrying a load of shame I could not shake. Freedom from the oppressiveness of my fears that seemed to cripple me. As I read Isaiah 58, the words came at me like gale force winds of the Holy Spirit, reminding me that Jesus came to set the prisoners free.\n\nThese words of truth changed me.\n\nBut about two years after I was first so deeply affected by the Scripture, I began to see that Isaiah 58 was meant to be more than a spiritual metaphor for me—it was a command for all of the people of God and spoke to a reality of literal slavery and oppression. The prophet Isaiah was indicting Israel for the physical captivity and oppression in which they were complicit; most importantly he was connecting their lack of justice to their false worship before God.\n\nSeeking justice—bringing right order and exerting life-giving power to protect the vulnerable—is a command that the God of justice gives to us all.But, fighting injustice—the abuse of power that oppresses the vulnerable through violence and lies—can be excruciatingly hard work. It can be exhausting. So, seeking justice begins with seeking our God who created justice; our God who longs to use us, every one of his children, to bring justice; our God who offers us the yoke of Jesus in exchange for things that otherwise leave us defeated. He offers to make our burdens light.\n\nThe gospel is about spiritual freedom from sin and reconciliation to God through Jesus for eternal life, and it is also about bringing physical freedom for those suffering abuse and oppression. Our lives are meant to proclaim that Jesus has broken our spiritual chains, and in this proclamation we join Jesus in seeking justice for the oppressed.\n\nWhen we understand the reality that God sees injustice and calls his people to act, we will grow to see that our own personal freedom and reconciliation in Christ is not the end of the story. We are free so that we can be part of God’s work of setting others free.\n\nThe questions we find ourselves asking as we meet God in his Word are ever changing and ever expanding. But what is most important is that we continually put ourselves in front of God’s Word, to ask the Holy Spirit to guide us—this will draw us ever nearer to understanding justice first in the heart of God and next in our own lives.\n\n___________________\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Hayley Morgan\n\nText: Isaiah 59:14-21, Micah 6:8, Luke 4:16-21, Isaiah 30:18\n\nTherefore the Lord waits to be gracious to you, and therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you. For the Lord is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for him.\n\n– Isaiah 30:18\n\nGod’s mercy and grace are the great equalizers. His mercy steals a believer from the jaws of death (which she surely deserves), and sweeps her up into His unending grasp. She is then washed clean and made a daughter of God—such grace! All good gifts she receives are not of her own goodness but are from God above (see James 1:17).\n\nSometimes though, we can forget that. We can start to think that any good thing, be it beauty or position or money or extra time, is something we’re owed, something we’ve earned. We can start to live tightfisted, with insular lives, just living small and serving our own interests. We can start to live like we can meet God’s standards in our own power, with no need for Him. \n\nWe can twist the idea of justice—the restoration of all that is good and right, the recognition and treatment of all people as God’s creation—and make it about us, about “fairness” from our own limited perspective. We can forget that justice and mercy are not mutually exclusive, but rather both characteristics of the one true God.\n\nI think when we first taste God’s mercy and grace, we fully know it’s unwarranted pardon and an extravagant gift. We relish the unexpected sweetness, and we want everyone else to experience it, too. We want to show the lovely gift we received from our Father who calls us the apple of His eye. But over time, just like a dessert you eat every day or a gift you see every day, the shininess wears off. We take it for granted. But God’s blessing is one gift we should never grow used to. \n\nTim Keller says, “Grace is key to it all…It is the generosity of God, the freeness of his salvation, that lays the foundation for the society of justice for all” (from Generous Justice).\n\nDid you catch that? Grace lays the foundation for justice. \n\nWhen we understand God’s insane mercy and grace, we will be compelled to live them out in our own lives, meeting the needs of others in love. The Holy Spirit will grow fruits in us that enable us to act justly. But when we forget the generosity of God and the freeness of salvation, we will begin serving ourselves instead of others.\n\nLet’s not be women who forget. Let’s not take for granted God’s grace and mercy in our lives. Let’s remember that we were pardoned and accepted into the family of God. That goodness and sweetness is restoration, friends, and we should seek that restoration for others.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Jeremiah 20:1-18, Psalm 140:12, Isaiah 10:1-4\n\nI know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and will execute justice for the needy.\n\n– Psalm 140:12\n\nI like quiet. I have four small children, three of whom are boys, and I really like quiet. Everything about my boys is loud. Even the way they breathe seems unnecessarily loud. I say unsteady things to my husband like, “The children are making me nervous.” Honestly, I don’t even 100% enjoy the sound of children laughing.\n\nSince I’m the boss, I mandate a lot of quiet time. Those children want to yell? Fine, I’ll make them pay by not speaking for a week. They deserve it because they are disrupters of my peace.\n\nOk, but here’s the thing. I am the loudest person in my house. Seriously. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I get excited when I talk, sing a lot, clank around in the kitchen, and holler up the stairs. You know how some women are wonderful and soft spoken? Yeah, I think they’re wonderful, too.\n\nSo, when my little boys wake me up at 5:30am by kicking the walls and shouting, I think, “VENGEANCE IS MINE!” And I send those little stinkers outside to wake up the neighborhood instead. But what I forget is how my family and friends forgive me all the time for doing the same thing. I make a lot of noise. It’s pretty hypocritical for me to keep this double standard.\n\nIn Psalm 140:12, David says, “You have no right to ask for justice when you are an oppressor.” Oh no! In my house, I am the oppressor! Sure, it’s my job to train and discipline these little people, and I would be wrong to let them run wild. But in my little sphere of authority, I’m a volume tyrant. I’m the only one who is allowed to be loud.\n\nI love the idea of international justice. Goodness, I love widows and orphans, right? But big, sexy international justice has to begin with boring, everyday justice in my home. (And, as those with feet on the ground for international justice know, it is hardly glamorous.)\n\nIf I am going to dream big about international justice, I need to stop being an oppressor myself.\n\nHow can we begin to seek and live out justice in our own lives? We must see our own sin for what it is: not a difference of opinion, or an innocent mistake, or a personal right. Rather, it is a rank offense to God. Our double standard is the very thing that put Christ on the cross. It isn’t innocent at all.\n\nOnly when we see the horror of our sin, and the grace of a God who loves us in spite of it, can we begin to know what God’s vision of justice really is. This thought makes me quiet and grateful. And when my heart stops shouting about vengeance, I can hear God remind me that “Vengeance is MINE!” (Romans 12:19). Not Rebecca’s petty vengeance. God’s vengeance. And goodness, aren’t we glad?\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jennie Allen\n\nText: Luke 14:12-24, Deuteronomy 10:18-19, Exodus 23:6-9\n\nSo show your love for the alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.\n\n– Deuteronomy 10:19, NASB\n\nAliens… I relate to the word. I feel so out of place at times.\n\nRecently my husband was sitting across the table from me at our lovely, unsuspecting Italian restaurant. He pushed in close, but I didn’t have words to define the tears hitting the table. He knew. More than 2 years ago we prayed a prayer and its repercussions were everywhere.\n\n“God—we will do anything.”\n\nOur anythings seemed to be costing us everything. Nothing about our previously sane lives was the same. Over the previous year we had given up all control, and God had taken us up on those simple, naive little words.\n\nSince we prayed, God led us deeper into the lives of the people He loved and further from the safety of the familiar. That night I wondered… Should we take back our prayer?\n\nIf you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it. (Matthew 16:25)\n\nFreedom and healing hide in the backwards way God tells us to find life.\n\nDie to live. Lose to find. Empty yourself to be filled.\n\nIn Luke 14, Jesus describes a banquet. It is beautifully spread out. Everyone has been invited. But as the host prepares to welcome his friends, he realizes everyone has made an excuse of some sort. And no one comes.\n\nDisappointed, he sends his servant out into the streets to go get the poor, the crippled—the blind and the lame. The servant goes and gets them all, bringing them to the incredible banquet, but there is still room. Room for more.\n\nThe master then tells his servant,\n\n“Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled.”\n\nCan you imagine his servant? How nervous and excited and confused he must feel leaving the banquet and running for the least likely party candidates. His master sends him for those who won’t take love for granted.\n\nWe get to be part of giving people God. \n\nGod’s economy makes beautiful exchanges: as we give, we grow. You do not risk like a fool; you are wisely investing in the only two things that will not die: God and people’s souls.\n\nJust like the master to his servant, God whispers through the words of Scripture to us.\n\nRun on; go get my people. Go to the crippled, the poor, the blind, the lame—they know they need Me. They will come. And after they come, run out to the highway and grab whoever you can—the gates are flung open. Fill up my table! \n\nCompel them! You were reconciled to me so that you can reconcile others to me. You are my ambassadors. I am making my appeal through you. Run on. (paraphrased portions of 2 Cor. 5:17-20)\n\nNo matter how uncomfortable and chaotic our lives seem to keep getting, Zac and I could never take back the words of that prayer. Yes, there are nights that tears hit the pillow or our Italian food. But it is worth it. Anything, God. This is life—running to the highways, arms waving, full of God and giving Him away. It is what we were built for, it is what we were saved for, and my heart feels most at home here, doing just this—loving my God and loving His people.\n\nGod is home to us, and helping others find their way home makes our journey here a little less alien-feeling, don’t you think?\n\n___________________\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Jeremiah 22:3, Zechariah 7:8-14, Matthew 9:35-36, Mark 12:41-43, Leviticus 5:11-13\n\n“When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.”\n\n– Matthew 9:36\n\n“For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”\n\n– Galatians 5:14\n\nWhen I think of the vulnerable people whom I have truly loved, the list is short and predictable:\n\nMy three children.\n\nMy father in his last painful years of life.\n\nA few other family members, babies and children along the way.\n\nThere were the obligatory mission trips when I was in high school and college. I remember well the worn, suntanned face of an elderly woman in Appalachia, the irresistible smiles of inner city kids in St. Louis. It was a kind of love, to be sure. But I’m not convinced it’s exactly what Jesus had in mind when he commanded us to love our neighbor as ourselves. I don’t know about you, but I prefer when those who love me stick around a while.\n\nThere is another name I can add to that list. Let’s call her Rose.\n\nRose walks the neighborhood each day, beginning at 8 in the morning and continuing until dusk. I know she starts at 8 because I asked her once. We became friends in the 9 years we were neighbors — that is, from the same part of town. Rose has no formal residence of her own but moves from place to place, paying rent to friends. She walks for no particular reason and for all the reasons. She walks because she can’t not walk. One might have the urge to feel sorry for Rose, but she doesn’t feel sorry for herself. Other than voicing some worry when folks are unkind to her, I’ve not heard her utter a single negative word. “Be careful,” she always calls after me when we say goodbye. And she always asks about my kids. Always.\n\nLove is officially defined as “a feeling of warm personal attachment or deep affection.”\n\nPity, on the other hand, is “sympathetic or kindly sorrow evoked by the suffering, distress, or misfortune of another.”\n\nPity is not a bad thing. Pity is often appropriate. But Jesus didn’t call us to pity. Jesus calls us to love.\n\nI pitied Rose for years, but then I got to know her. When I allowed myself to develop a “warm personal attachment” to her, and her to me, “pity” no longer described my feelings at all. Rose is my friend. I love her.\n\nLet’s picture Jesus in this passage from Matthew 9. Read it again, if you have a minute.\n\nJesus had compassion on the people “because they were harassed and helpless.” Oh, but our Jesus, He did not merely pity that crowd in desperate need of a Savior. He loved them. He had the deepest of affection for them—for us!\n\nThroughout the New Testament, and even the Old, we don’t see God’s tolerance of or pity for the poor—we see His fierce love and even His preference for the poor and vulnerable. \n\nThe widow’s offering? It was worth more to Him than the richest man’s treasure. The most daring rescue of all time? It started with a baby in a manger. The first people to know of Jesus’ birth? They were nameless shepherds, living life on the fringes of city and society. And the first to witness Christ’s resurrection from the dead? Two women, hardly the preferred spokespersons of their culture. The adjective “powerful” doesn’t even make the list.\n\nSo, what about us? Dare we show preference for the poor?\n\nDare we not pity but love the vulnerable, the way Jesus taught us to love? May we be so bold as to seek out not just one Rose in our lives, but open our eyes and hearts to the many vulnerable children of God among us? Could this become our rule rather than the exception?\n\nCan we start today?\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessica Honegger\n\nText: Luke 10:25-37, Matthew 5:46-47\n\n“For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?”\n\n– Matthew 5:46a\n\nI recently sat on the floor in the hut of an Indian slum with a paralyzed woman. She taught me how to Kantha stitch one of the pieces for Noonday Collection,  the organization I run that creates economic opportunity for the vulnerable. Unable to leave her house, this work provided her enough income to send her kids to school. I had so little in common with her– in language, physical ability, culture, and economics. Who was I to come into her home? Me, with my American privilege. Me, with my able body. Me, with my life of so little suffering.\n\nAnd yet, this is what Jesus did for us. He left Heaven—His perfect culture, with all the comfort and untainted love He shared with the Father— to become incarnate. And He now invites each of us to do the same for one another.\n\nMoving into different and uncomfortable spaces to love sacrificially is a theme Jesus pounded into earth during his leave of absence from Heaven. In the story of the Good Samaritan we see an invitation to STOP. To be INTERRUPTED. To be INTENTIONAL to meet the vulnerable who may look different than ourselves.\n\nWhen we leave what is comfortable to share the burden of another, we become incarnational ministers with Jesus. After all, it was Jesus who asked us, “For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?” (Matthew 5:46)\n\n“Jesus is the Great Samaritan to whom the Good Samaritan points.”\n\n– Tim Keller, Generous Justice\n\nTake a look at the people in your life. Do they all look the same as you? How often does the opportunity to love inconveniently, unexpectedly, and with someone who can give little in return (and I am not talking about parenting!) occur in your week? Tim Keller defines agape love as serving a person “for their good and intrinsic value, not for what the person brings you.” Yet we are often fearful of what it could mean to become the Good Samaritan in our daily life. It is too messy to actually incarnate, so we write a check instead because that feels safer. Or we act the Good Samaritan partly for selfish reasons—we love how it makes us appear. We declare ourselves obedient with ten degrees of separation, still keeping us safe from human suffering. \n\nGod’s invitation to us is to agape love. It is to a love full of self-forgetfulness.\n\nThe good news is we can begin emulating the Great Samaritan even when we’re scared. We can start small. We can even move reluctantly, because God will capture our hearts for His beloved with or without our permission. We may certainly act imperfectly; faithfully serving the poor, prioritizing their dignity and intrinsic worth is a complicated road with many false starts. I have loved sincerely but poorly in my journey with the vulnerable. I have commoditized and patronized unknowingly. I have volunteered too far outside my skills, acting as a midwife in the mountains of Bolivia (I have a degree in Latin American Studies but not obstetrics!) and served on a hoity toity board (even worse). And yet the only way I am learning to agape love is by practicing! Not just praying “God give me a heart for the poor” or waiting for that perfect opportunity (because there is no perfect when it comes to justice…it is entirely untidy), but by doing.\n\nBecause ultimately, Jesus left heaven where salvation was still an unrealized plan and came to earth to actually save a desperate humanity. May we draw courage from His resolve and strength from His mercy to go and do likewise.\n\n \n\n____________________\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Gary A. Haugen\n\nText: Isaiah 51:4-6, Isaiah 1:17, Matthew 23:1-11, 23-28\n\n“Learn to do good. Seek justice. Help the oppressed. Defend the cause of orphans. Fight for the rights of widows.”\n\n– Isaiah 1:17, NIV\n\nIn my work at International Justice Mission, I often see people experience reactions of paralyzing despair when they learn that there are nearly 30 million people held in slavery in our world. Or that a stunning 4 billion people live “outside the protection of the law” – that is, they live in places where they are utterly defenseless from violent people.\n\nThere is a lot of darkness in our world. So, what do we do?\n\nWhen our kids were little, sometimes they refused to go to bed because they were afraid of the dark. So we began a tradition called “charging the darkness.” I would stand outside the doorway and charge into the darkness of the room. Of course nothing would happen and my kids would burst out laughing and see that there was nothing to fear in the dark.\n\nLikewise, I think that the God of light, “in whom there is no darkness at all,” is yearning for us to charge the darkness. To be bearers of light in the darkest places.\n\nAnd even when the darkness seems pitch black, there are ways that the smallest light can begin to change everything.\n\nSo, how do we charge the darkness?\n\nI want to share just 3 powerful ways I’ve seen courageous people of faith charging the darkness.\n\nDefend the poor.\n\nMost of the people today who are trapped as slaves, or held unjustly in prison, or are having their houses destroyed by men with machetes cannot afford to have advocates defend them.  Yet, that is something we can actually do for them. Wouldn’t we want someone to do that for us? Paying for the rescue and defense of the poor is something we can and must do.\n\nRaise your voice.\n\nIn every forum where poverty is being discussed, you can begin to raise your voice and ask, “What are we doing about the problems of violence against the poor?” My prayer is that as Christians, we will recover our role in building communities where the poor are protected from violence, sustainably through functioning criminal justice systems. Christians played a wonderful role in sounding the alarm on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. They became world leaders in confronting and engaging it. You can look to the struggle against slavery in the 19th century, to the struggle against child labor, to the civil rights movement. In each era, the church not only deployed those with specialized expertise and skill to the work of justice, but the whole church joined in by raising its voice as advocates for the poor. This is the church at its best!\n\nLook Around.\n\nSearch within your own life and community to see who around you might be suffering from intimidation and fear. Consider how you could be the one who breaks through with hope and God’s power to bring justice and restoration. Spend time rediscovering, not only God’s passion for justice in the scriptures, but also God’s promises for those who pursue justice (Isaiah 58). I invite you to test God’s faithfulness and power. You will be impressed and encouraged.\n\nLet me encourage you not to give up. God is building a movement—one of ordinary people, like you and me, who are starting right where we are to confront the injustice in our world. We’ve seen God do mighty things through the willing hearts of people. For this reason, I actually have a lot of hope—because people like you are paying attention, lifting your voice, applying pressure, and not giving up.  \n\nIt is indeed incredible that God chooses to accomplish the miraculous through the ordinary. Let’s continue to charge the darkness—to take one step at a time, as we follow His holy and good call to us: Seek Justice.\n\n_______________\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessica Honegger\n\nText: Colossians 1:16-17, Isaiah 58:10-12, Matthew 25:31-40, Jeremiah 22:16\n\n“If you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.”\n\n– Isaiah 58:10\n\n“I will tell you what my problem is,” said Wanda glaring at me, “my problem is HER! Because I ain’t nobody’s summer project.” I was 19, and living for the summer in the very place where God awakened my heart to the work He was doing among the poor—inner city Washington DC.\n\nWhen I first fell in love with Jesus in my early teens, He made 2 things very clear to me: 1) I was the object of His affection, and 2) He loved the poor and wanted to me to “know Him” by spending my life engaged with the poor.\n\nAnd so here I found myself, a white privileged teenager interning in a home for women recovering from drug addiction. When Wanda called me out during our weekly house meeting, I froze. Was I treating her like a project? It sure could seem that way— me zipping in for the summer to live in a home of recovering addicts, to ensure they followed house rules and to engage in their recovery journey. “Jesus is my only project,” was all I could muster.\n\nAfter a few weeks, Wanda asked to talk with me. “Thanks for letting me get mad at you and loving me anyway. When I was your age, I was already turning tricks on the streets. I am so jealous that you are on the right track when I wasted so many years of my life.”\n\nI am thankful Wanda taught me, when I was still so young, that the poor are not a project. Colossians 1:16-17 talks about how God created ALL things and that in EVERYTHING Christ has the supremacy. This includes poor communities. As Corbett and Fikkert summarize in When Helping Hurts, Christ is and has been actively at work in poor communities. When we enter into the lives of the poor, it is like walking on Holy Ground. \n\nColossians goes on to say that, through the cross of Jesus, God has reconciled to Himself ALL things that were broken. The broken relationship we had with God— REDEEMED! The broken relationship man had with one another— RENEWED! The broken relationship we had with work and nature— RESTORED! The broken relationship we had with ourselves— RESCUED!\n\nGod calls each of us to not only share the gospel in words, but to be agents of reconciliation across all of the above relationships in order to create a flourishing world. The good news of the Kingdom that Jesus announced in Luke 4:17-21, is the “renewal of the whole world through the entrance of supernatural forces. As things are brought back under Christ’s rule, they are restored to health, beauty and freedom” (Tim Keller). Communities are restored through the all-encompassing nature of the gospel.\n\nIt doesn’t matter that you may have different experiences, speak a different language, or come from a different income bracket than your poor neighbor. Each of us is invited by God Himself to spend ourselves on behalf of the poor. This is what it means to know God. This is what it means to love mercy.\n\n____________________\n\n",

It is said that collectively we are the hands and feet of Christ, the very body that can carry out His desires on Earth.\n\nWhen we humble ourselves before the Lord, we recognize that our own life is gone and we are bonded and risen with Christ. If we stay in step (walk humbly) with Him, we’ll know His heart and come to discern what makes it beat faster.\n\nThis world is broken with sin. It is evident in every facet of life, bringing forth everything from poverty to pride, from violence and vengeance to apathy and indifference. Sin causes rifts in relationships. Sin is always a break in the way God intended the world to be.\n\nTim Keller writes about a beautiful concept of “reweaving shalom” in his book Generous Justice. If we look at the tapestry of life, we can see there are threads that are broken. We can see the beauty of the whole has been compromised in places, worn out, torn through, frayed.\n\nBut shalom, it is peace times infinity.It is the powerful and holy peace that comes from God, from His power and in His grace. As believers, we have access to this shalom through the Holy Spirit and we can begin to repair the fabric of life in His name. \n\nKeller writes about the gifts we have been given— our time, resources, and power. When we have a right view of God and ourselves, we know these gifts are evidence of a gracious Giver not our own goodness. So, we can humbly use our time, resources, and places of authority or influence to strengthen and restore the fabric of life for others.\n\nWhen we are acting out of step with God, these gifts can become idols in themselves. But, when we walk humbly with Him, we see that we can use these gifts to make things right here on Earth. To be the hands and feet of Christ and begin to reweave shalom in the fabric of our communities is an exciting gift in itself!\n\n“Reweaving shalom means to sacrificially thread, lace, and press your time, goods, power, and resources into the lives and needs of others” (Tim Keller, Generous Justice). We can be part of making the whole fabric of life stronger and more beautiful by using the gifts He has given us.\n\nWe learn how to use those gifts by walking humbly with Him.\n\n \n\n",

When was the last time you thought of yourself as having glory? I tend to think of myself as, well, just me. And I’m ashamed to say I often think nothing of others at all. But if we believe what the Bible says is true—that we are made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27)—then shouldn’t we live like it?\n\nThe awareness of God’s image in us should change the way we view the world. It should change the way we view our brothers and sisters, neighbors and strangers, even our enemies.It should be our “first great motivation for living lives of generous justice, serving the needs and guarding the rights of those around us” (Tim Keller, emphasis mine).\n\nWhen we serve others, we are serving Jesus. Isn’t that what He taught us? (See Matthew 25:31-46.)\n\nJesus also said that love is laying down your life for a friend (John 15:13). Then He proved it by giving His life for us. We didn’t deserve it. We deserved justice. Yet He took what we deserved upon himself and mercifully gave the impossible gift.\n\nHis was the ultimate “real and costly love.” \n\nHere we are, sinners in a sinful world, longing for the world to be brought to right. (Because even in a world of blurred lines, there is still a right.) We’ve tasted something deeper, sweeter than mere fairness — We’ve experienced the kiss of justice and mercy that can only come from the one true God, and we long for the world to experience it, too. We long to see the broken restored, the sick healed, the enslaved set free, and the oppressed liberated.\n\nThis longing for justice is God-given and right. But if the longing for justice in our hearts does not translate to our hands, we do not fully grasp the passion of our God. \n\nGod is passionate about justice.\n\nHe is passionate about mercy.\n\nHe is passionate about people.\n\nWe will be, too, if we are passionate about Him.\n\nJustice is gathering up the love and hope we’ve been given in Jesus and giving it to those who need it most— in the form of our resources and time, our talents and strength, our words and the work of our hands.\n\nJustice is carrying the Gospel in our literal hands to a world of people just as messed up and undeserving as us, who are made in the very image of the God to whom we pray.\n\nJustice is a lifetime of linking arms with our Justifier, in pursuit of bringing the world to right, the way He made it to be — Whole. Full. Beautiful. Peaceful. Good.\n\n“Justice is doing for others what we would want done for ourselves.” – Gary A. Haugen\n\nAnd it starts right where you are, right now, today.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nAfter His baptism and before the start of His ministry on earth, the incarnate Son of God walked into the wilderness, no food or drink in hand. He fasted forty days and forty nights, Scripture tells us, and then “the tempter approached him” (Matthew 4:3). Hungry and thirsty and holding no tangible thing of value, Jesus was tempted to take hold of power, to test the Father’s love for Him, to make for Himself a feast of bread to satiate His languishing body. When His human weakness was met with temptation, how did He respond? Using the words of Scripture, He turned to the Father. \n\nInstead of reaching out for what the world would say He needed, Jesus clung to what He couldn’t live without: “He answered, ‘It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God’” (Matthew 4:4). Rather than yielding to the devil’s enticements, Jesus yielded Himself to the Father and glorified Him: “Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him” (v.10). \n\nOur culture views empty-handedness as the lowliest of conditions. We are trained to find our worth in usefulness and status, and to seek joy in our possessions. On the off chance we look down to find our hands empty, we quickly scoop up something to hold on to—some bit of work or wealth, some duty or distraction to busy our bodies and entertain our minds. But this hands-full gospel is not the message of Jesus. \n\nLent is a season where we once again remember that our hope and strength are found in nothing but the cross of Christ. By engaging in daily Scripture reading, prayer, confession, and repentance in these weeks leading up to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, we retrain our hearts to embrace the salvation we cannot earn. We came empty-handed when we first gave our lives to Him, and we have nothing of our own as we return to Him now—only what He has freely and graciously given us.\n\nThis forty-day walk into the wilderness will bring us face to face with the depth of our lack, our human frailty, and our sin. But it will bring us to the cross, where our High Priest, who modeled perfect dependence on the Father, will show us the cost of our forgiveness in the marks on His body, even as He invites us to receive mercy. \n\nLent is an invitation to put down everything we have picked up in order to take hold of the only One who can truly satisfy our heart’s deepest longings. It is a call to turn back, and experience a season of refreshing for our souls (Acts 3:19). Come with open hands, and freely receive (Isaiah 55).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy John Greco\n\nLent is more than a season on the Church calendar. It’s a journey.\n\nThe road we take from Ash Wednesday to Holy Saturday is not an easy one. It is a path of preparation and testing, and as we travel, we are invited to set our faces toward the cross. But it is not a road without joy, for Jesus Himself travels with us, inviting us into a deeper relationship with Him and a richer experience of His kingdom. \n\nIn the book of Jeremiah, the stones are laid for the road to Calvary. Through the prophet the Lord first revealed the mystery of the new covenant. Jeremiah announced to Israel that God was going to do something new in this world, something that would unravel the knots of sin and death and bring us back to our Creator.\n\nThrough Jeremiah, the Lord promised, “I will forgive their iniquity and never again remember their sin” (Jeremiah 31:34), and it was Jesus who gave these words their fulfillment. Holding up the cup at the Last Supper, He made the connection to the cross clear: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you” (Luke 22:20). \n\nThe book of Jeremiah recounts the last days of Judah before the destruction of Jerusalem and the sorrow of the Babylonian exile. It is itself a picture of where our sins lead us apart from the grace of God. In this account, we see our own depravity. Though our sins may differ from those of our ancient counterparts, our hearts are just as prone to wander. And it is only when we see the depths of our own sin that we can see the glory of the cross for what it truly is. During Lent, we take time to reflect on Christ’s sacrifice, and we repent of our own sins that made the cross necessary in the first place.\n\nThere is also much to gain in getting to know Jeremiah, who stands apart as a faithful man among faithless people—persecuted, beaten, and left for dead because he spoke the words God gave him to speak. He suffered for the gospel long before there was a complete and proper gospel message to proclaim. His life is an arrow pointing to Jesus, who was also obedient despite the cost, and who recognized that God-given joy is worth more than anything this world has to offer. \n\nThis Lenten season, we will follow Jesus to the mount of crucifixion, but we will do so with Jeremiah as our guide and fellow disciple for the journey. “‘Look, the days are coming’—this is the Lord’s declaration—‘when I will fulfill the good promise that I have spoken’” (Jeremiah 33:14). The cross proclaims this truth, and the empty tomb assures us that our hope is not in vain.\n\n",

The world held seemingly endless possibilities, but this only crippled me in the decision-making process. \n\nJeremiah’s calling was clearly and specifically communicated to him. Scripture tells us that long before he was even born, God intended to use him as His prophetic instrument. “I chose you before I formed you in the womb,” God declared. “I set you apart before you were born” (Jeremiah 1:5). Commanded to warn the people of Judah against apostasy, Jeremiah received instructions for his calling very early on in life—a clear purpose with detailed words from the Lord for the salvation and flourishing of a specific people. \n\nEven so, Jeremiah protested, saying, “Oh no, Lord God! Look, I don’t know how to speak since I am only a youth” (v.6). Wouldn’t we react the same way? Imagine how intimidating it must’ve been to be chosen as God’s mouthpiece for the purpose of declaring judgment and punishment on the sins of the nations. Not only was the job description itself daunting, but the guy delivering it was still really young and without much life experience. But God reassured Jeremiah again and again that He would be there to rescue him (vv.7–8, 19). \n\nAs comforting as God’s reassurance must have been, the call to be His prophet was in no way an easy job for Jeremiah. On the other hand, what a blessing and relief to have God specifically communicate His calling for you at such a young age. Jeremiah knew what it would look like to obey God’s will. Now he just had to walk in it. \n\nWhat about you? Where do you find comfort in the story of Jeremiah’s calling? \n\nGod chooses all of our callings. Designing us to carry out a unique purpose at a specific time and place, He equips us with gifts to help bring restoration to the world (Hebrews 13:21). How exciting is that? Even when we shudder in our boots a little, like Jeremiah did, we can rest assured knowing that He who calls is with us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nI work out at a small gym located on the corner of a busy street in Nashville. Joe, the owner, is a former body-builder with a bald head and more muscles than I could grow in a lifetime. Every Monday and Wednesday, he puts us through the standard suffering: jumping jacks, push-ups, lunges, weighted squats, bicep curls, body movements made impossible with the aid of resistance bands. When my sweat turns to tears and I groan and complain and curse, Joe looks at me and shrugs. \n\n“I’m sorry,” he says, then announces the next set. \n\nI know an empty apology when I hear it. If Joe were really sorry about my pain, he wouldn’t go on inflicting it—well, unless it were for my good in the long run; I do pay him for the “suffering,” after all. And that’s just the thing. Real apologies aren’t just words—they are words of genuine feeling married to new actions. Apply that on a cosmic, spiritual level, and that’s where we find the Israelites in Jeremiah chapters 4 through 5. The people are unrepentant, unwilling to marry their words with genuine feeling or change. And the Lord, in his mercy, can no longer stand idly by while they sin themselves into destruction. \n\nCountless times over the course of this passage, I hear God’s heart in the words He uses to try and woo back the people He loves: Return to me. I long to make you My sons. I will not be angry forever. Return, I will heal. Through Jeremiah, the Lord is telling His people that the way they live their lives matters. At one point in this passage, He calls them to “remove the foreskin of [their] hearts” (Jeremiah 4:4). It’s a harsh word picture, no doubt, but one that reminds us that an outward sign like circumcision means nothing if not paired with an inner heart that values holiness, purity, and connection to God. When I verbally acknowledge that I have lied, but keep lying, I am not truly repentant. Real repentance is accompanied by a change in heart and behavior—a desire to turn away from sin and turn back to God.\n\nJeremiah would foretell what Jesus accomplished on the cross, the prophet’s words fully realized through the actions of the promised Messiah. Thank goodness we have Jesus’s accomplishments, because the truth is, despite our best efforts, we are unfaithful and will continue to fail in our own strength. But “in him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace that he richly poured out on us with all wisdom and understanding” (Ephesians 1:7–8). \n\nThrough Jeremiah, the Lord called the Israelites to look through the streets of Jerusalem, to search for a single person who acts justly, yet they couldn’t find a single one. On a good day, my life is full of folly, selfishness, and vanity. I’m sure if I had been alive in Jeremiah’s day, I would’ve been as unrepentant as the Israelites, “who made their faces harder than rock, and… refused to return” (Jeremiah 5:3). \n\nBut there is good news for me, for each one of us: in Christ Jesus, we have been blessed “with every spiritual blessing in the heavens,” and “sealed with the promised Holy Spirit when [we] heard the word of truth, the gospel of [our] salvation… when [we] believed” (Ephesians 1:3,13). This does not change, even when we fail, even when we struggle to match our words to our actions. Jesus, who loves us, is forgiving and does not run out of invitations for us to return to Him. What God is looking to find in us is not perfect faithfulness—only Jesus can be perfectly faithful. What God is looking for in you and in me is a heart that longs to seek Him. By His Spirit, may we turn to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nWe used to own a truck with over 300,000 miles on it. I loved driving it. The leather was cracked and most of the dashboard lights were burned out. But easing it down a country road with all the windows down made me feel like the wind was at my back and things were going just my way. \n\nThere was one light, however, that wasn’t burned out: the check engine light. I took it to our favorite mechanic and he looked me square in the eye, “Stop driving this vehicle immediately—one wrong bump and the whole chassis is going to collapse off the axle. This truck will fail disastrously, and soon.” Driving home that afternoon, I considered his words: How soon? How ‘disastrous’ are we talking? How big of a bump? He was probably exaggerating—what even is an axle anyway?\n\nThings can look just fine on the surface, but rumbling beneath, the true worth will eventually reveal itself. In the case of my truck, it was a catastrophic failure waiting to happen. I thought I could depend on that old truck, but it couldn’t stand up in a way that mattered desperately. In the case of Israel, God appointed Jeremiah as an “assayer” to determine what they were made of—and if they would be able to stand up (Jeremiah 6:27). An assayer is a “refiner,” one who tests the composition of minerals and determines their value. The Lord goes so far as to declare they are so stubborn that they “are bronze and iron; all of them are corrupt” (v.28). But no amount of blasting with fire will reveal valuable metals because the people have rejected the word of the Lord (v.17).\n\nThe culture described in these chapters is a startling reminder of my own: “they have grown powerful and rich… fat and sleek… [and] excelled in evil matters… and they have not defended the rights of the needy” (Jeremiah 5:27–28). God is calling us to listen to His words and turn from the enticements of this world. He warns that we will be measured and the truth of our hearts will be revealed. \n\nWho can stand in the face of such an examination? Even though my friendly truck seemed fine to me, it’s impending disaster could not be hidden from the experienced eye of a mechanic. If we persist in not using our eyes to see or our ears to hear—if we refuse to listen to the Lord, our devastation is sure. Indeed, it is our own sins that withhold the Lord’s bounty from us (Jeremiah 5:25). \n\nIf you are determined not to listen, you cannot stand up to a close examination. But set your feet in obedience to the Lord and He will change the quality of your heart, and deeper examination will reveal the value of His own shining goodness in you. Today if you hear His voice—in His word, in His creation, through His people—do not harden your heart, but listen and worship (Psalm 95:8).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nIf I had a nickel for every time my two daughters had conflict. The offense could be teasing, hitting, not sharing, or a million other things. After talking privately with each of them, I would bring the girls back together, stand them face-to-face and instruct the offender to say, “I’m sorry. It was wrong for me to __.” Occasionally, I would even ask them to hold hands, which caused them to roll their eyes at this admittedly awkward parenting strategy. \n\nMy goal was not for them to robotically repeat words or to just go through the motions to avoid punishment. As they practiced the external act of reuniting and verbally confessing their sin, my hope was that an inner posture of repentance would grow and that reconciliation would follow. My methods seemed external, yet my goal was always to shape their hearts.\n\nThroughout the Old Testament, we see how God established specific ways for His people to relate to Him and to others. The Ten Commandments set clear parameters for God’s people. First and foremost was the non-negotiable command to avoid all idolatry: to only worship the one true God (Exodus 20:3). In addition to the Ten Commandments, God gave many other instructions detailing how to conduct civil life, participate in temple worship, and offer sacrifices.\n\nWhat was the point of all these commands? Was God’s goal to create robotic rule-followers? Definitely not! God’s methods may seem external, but He was always fighting for their hearts. God’s goal was reconciliation and intimacy with His people. This is true for us today as well.\n\n“When I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt,  I did not speak with them or command them concerning burnt offering and sacrifice.  However, I did give them this command: ‘Obey me, and then I will be your God,  and you will be my people. Follow every way I command you so that it may go well with you’” (Jeremiah 7:22–23).\n\nThe God of all creation was pursuing relationship with His people—not moralistic law keeping. But they stubbornly resisted and forfeited intimacy by chasing false gods from the nations around them. They went through the motions of worshipping God in the temple, but their hearts were distant from Him. They shamelessly broke the Ten Commandments, which were actually God’s gracious blueprint for how to remain faithful, free, and flourishing. \n\nWe hear Jeremiah’s anguish as he weeps and wails over this wayward nation (Jeremiah 9:10). Over six hundred years later, we hear a similar lament from Jesus who weeps as He grieves over Jerusalem. Jesus ached for those so bent on human effort and religious duty that they could not recognize that Jesus, the Messiah, was in their midst. \n\nOh, if I had a nickel for every time I disobey God’s commands, for every time I trust in my external actions to validate me before God and others, for every time my heart grows cold and blind to Jesus.\n\nOh Lord, I confess that I’m the offender. I’m sorry. It is wrong for me to trust in my own efforts and to chase after things that deliver a mere, momentary buzz of satisfaction and security. Thank you for letting me hear that You long for more. You’ve always fought for the hearts of Your people. I’m so grateful You’re eternally, lovingly pursuing mine.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI spend a lot of time in the kitchen. It is my happiest place, but every once in a while my culinary ambitions do not match the contents of my cupboards, and I have to make substitutions. A little of this substituted for a little of that is usually no big deal in the world of spices and splashes, but when it comes to baking (my very favorite thing to do), substitutions can mean utter disaster.\n\nChemical reactions between ingredients are the key to successful bread, cookies, or just about any delicious baked thing. One of my favorite cake batters is made with a heavy dose of baking soda and, at the last minute, a big splash of vinegar. It bubbles into the oven, where it creates the loveliest, airiest cake you can imagine. \n\nNatural law governs chemical reactions; they are always the same. Vinegar and baking soda will always bubble up. Living yeast and warm water will do the same. A splash of vinegar will sour milk, and oil and water won’t mix on their own. There are generally no substitutes for these reactions when it comes to baking. Figuratively, this is the underlying principle found in Jeremiah 10–11: There is no substitute for the steadfast, unchanging God. He can only be who He is and do what is in His nature to do.\n\nThe truth Jeremiah prophesies is always the same: The promise God made is steadfast, unchangeable, and true, because the one who promised it is steadfast, unchangeable, and true. “You will be my people, and I will be your God,” is found through the whole of Scripture: when God makes His covenant with Abram (Genesis 17), when God tells Moses to confront Pharaoh (Exodus 6), during the giving of the law (Leviticus 26), and multiple times here, within the book of Jeremiah. Paul repeats it in 2 Corinthians 6, and it appears in Revelation 21, with a definitive promise for all time: “They will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them and will be their God” (v.3). \n\nThis is the covenant promise that will never change. I can imagine Jeremiah weeping with desperation as he wrote the beautiful words that testify to the Lord’s sovereignty and promise:\n\n“He made the earth by his power, established the world by his wisdom, and spread out the heavens by his understanding… he is the one who formed all things.  Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; the LORD of Armies is his name” (Jeremiah 10:12,16).\n\nThere is no substitute for the Lord of Armies. His reactions to the sins of His people are not separate from His steadfast, unchangeable love. He’d called them to obey Him and follow His commands, which were a kindness to them, part of the covenant promise (Jeremiah 11:4). But that’s not necessarily how the Israelites saw things. When Jeremiah writes of the stiff-necked Israelites who have repeatedly turned away from God, he writes confidently of how the Lord will act “because they had not done what [He] commanded them to do” (v.8).\n\nThe book of Jeremiah shows God’s justice and love: how His perfect character demands perfect righteousness, and how His love for His people is unfailing. Jeremiah didn’t know how that promise would culminate hundreds of years later on the cross where Jesus died, taking on every ounce of God’s just anger and every molecule of God’s perfect love. It is a gift to cling to the steadfast promises of our unchanging God, who is always, perfectly, unchangingly good.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nJeremiah is not the first prophet (nor the last) to grow weary with the wayward. Can’t you just picture his hunched shoulders and deep sighs as he asked, “Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the treacherous live at ease?” (Jeremiah 12:1). \n\nLike the psalmist who confessed that they envied the prosperity of the wicked (Psalm 73:3), Job whose pain convinced him that the righteous were the butt of every joke (Job 12:1–6), and Jonah, who despaired when the Ninevites received mercy, not wrath (Jonah 4:1–4)— the Bible records a long list of people of faith who had lost faith in humanity. \n\nAs I read their words, I’m waylaid by the realization that my own heart wants to default to that same setting. It’s so easy to shake my head and wag my finger, to lump mankind into the categories of “us” and “them,” and wonder why those “on the other side” are having all the fun. And yet, we never find God joining the pity parties of the righteous. While His judgments are clear and His righteousness does not bend, He relentlessly chases the lost. In response to Jeremiah’s despondency, God says, “After I have uprooted them, I will once again have compassion on them and return each one to his inheritance and to his land” (Jeremiah 12:15). \n\nRight here, in the middle of an Old Testament book, we find the message of the gospel, the needed balm for every cynical soul. Jeremiah had forgotten, as we all tend to do, that when compared to God, no one is righteous, not one (Romans 3:10–12)—not even weeping prophets. We deserve death, not mercy. Our pity parties end when we remember we’re all trophies of God’s grace freely given to us. Every single one of us.\n\nIn Hosea’s prophetic book, it was the Lord’s turn for deep sighs as He lamented, “My people are bent on turning from me” (Hosea 11:7). The reality of our sin nature is as evident in us today as it ever was then, and yet, this is how our God responds:\n\n“I will not vent the full fury of my anger; I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim. For I am God and not man, The Holy One among you; I will not come in rage” (Hosea 11:9). \n\nWhen it looks like the lost have something we are lacking, may the gospel remind us that we have been given grace over and over again. We have Christ. In Him, we have everything.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI just couldn’t get past the dirty underwear in today’s reading. I kept trying to be a grownup, and look for the big picture to find the deeper meaning. But picturing a venerable and vulnerable Jeremiah wedging underwear between rocks down by the river is a tough image to get past. I looked for other translations for the underwear and found: linen belt, loincloth, waistband, sash, girdle, undergarment, and linen shorts.\n\nNow, I love a breathable fabric just as much as anyone, but no matter how you slice it, it’s an intimate garment that’s been trashed. And it’s a metaphor for how the Lord has brought His people close and they turned out to be of no use, and rather an embarrassment, actually (Jeremiah 13:8–11). They’d refused to obey, fought among themselves, and had become proud, forgetting the Lord and trusting in lies instead (v.25). This is a picture of a people who have failed to heed the Lord’s warning to listen to Him in humility, confess their transgressions, and cry out for mercy (Jeremiah 13:15;14:7). The people of Judah had run after the idolatries of the world, rather than the treasures of the kingdom. \n\nIt’s a short step to confess that I am guilty of these same sins. All our hearts are idol factories, turning our gaze and affection toward lesser things. Apart from the tender mercies and the arresting grace of God, we will go the way of Israel and Judah, for even our very finest righteousness is as filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6).\n\nThe startling realization that we are a little like dirty underwear down by the river is the first step to healing. The Lord invites His people to confess their sins and put on the clean garment of His salvation (1 John 1:9). We are called to recognize with David and with Paul that “all have turned away; all alike have become corrupt. There is no one who does good, not even one” (Psalm 14:3; Romans 3:12). But we are not invited to sit and fixate on the filthiness and neediness of humanity. Instead, like Jeremiah, we are to cry out, “Are you not the LORD our God? We therefore put our hope in you” (Jeremiah 14:22).\n\nHope! We are called to put our hope in the Lord. This was such good news for Judah because they were certainly in a centuries-long snit of their own making. And this is beautiful news for us, too, because we are guilty of the same embarrassing rejections of God’s goodness and kindness toward us. This peculiar passage echoes that same gospel that the prophet Isaiah declared: “We all went astray like sheep; we all have turned to our own way; and the LORD has punished him for the iniquity of us all” (Isaiah 53:6). Though the first note of the gospel is our great guilt, the final note is one of resounding hope, and of praise for the undeserved lovingkindness God shows us.\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her six little people. Rebecca holds a bachelor’s degree in German from Hillsdale College, and most recently worked as the managing editor and writer at She Reads Truth.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nLast weekend, I tried to fly to Chicago during the biggest blizzard they’ve had all year—key word here being tried. To be fair, I knew snow was in the forecast, but I also assumed that it was always in the forecast, and therefore, just another Friday in the Windy City. This is one of those areas where people who live in cold-weather states get all puffy in their parkas and tell those of us who live in the blessed South, “Relax. We know how to deal with this. We have snow plows!” \n\nAfter arriving at the airport at an appropriately early time and confirming my flight’s “on time” status, I was relaxed. But just as I joined the line for coffee to pass the time before boarding, I got the dreaded text: My flight had been “cancelled.” \n\nThere’s a unique shade of panic when it comes to flight plans becoming totally derailed. You begin with a detailed, minute-by-minute itinerary of how exactly you’ll get from point A to point B, and then one small malfunction, or not-so-small storm, comes along and forces you to watch each well-planned step unravel before your very eyes. \n\nThe Israeilites knew what it was like to not have things go according to plan. Today’s reading recalls their deliverance by God from Egypt, which is the central act of redemption in the Old Testament. Throughout Scripture, God continues to remind His people of His promise-keeping trustworthiness and steadfast character, but Jeremiah 16 predicts a turbulent journey ahead for God’s people: their coming exile. \n\n“However, look, the days are coming… when it will no longer be said,  ‘As the LORD lives who brought the Israelites from the land of Egypt,’ but rather,  ‘As the LORD lives who brought the Israelites from the land of the north and from all the other lands where he had banished them.’  For I will return them to their land that I gave to their ancestors” (Jeremiah 16:14–15).\n\nA reroute doesn’t disqualify you from ending up where you’re supposed to be. In the case of the Israelites, who I imagine probably just wanted to end up somewhere safe, God didn’t just get them from point A to point B; He gave them freedom, releasing them from captivity and slavery, and brought them home. \n\nGod’s plan isn’t just to redirect us—it’s to redeem and restore us. He may not provide a step-by-step itinerary or a packing list, but I do believe that if we read the pages of Scripture and remember who He has been to us in the past, we get something even more important: a picture of His character. We don’t need to know the inclement weather plan or be reminded to put on our own air masks before assisting someone else. We just need to know who is in charge. And that is more than enough. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Brooke Kocher\n\nNo one told me this outright, but from an early age I felt that if I stopped doing good things, bad things would happen. On a big and small scale, this seemed to be the way the world worked, at least, I’d perceived it that way. I reasoned that since the world naturally flows toward disorder, my intervention was necessary to hold back the inevitable chaos. Thus began my love affair with productivity. My necessary intervention could range from tackling the mounting pile of dishes in the sink or clothes in the laundry basket, to the gripping fear I feel when I read Edmund Burke’s warning, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” I mean, I can’t do nothing!\n\nProductivity is attractive because it feels so reasonable and responsible and grown up. Are we not stewards of God’s creation? Aren’t we doing what God designed us to do by being in constant motion? My heart was drawn to the siren’s call of productivity, but since this heart of mine is also more deceitful than anything else (Jeremiah 17:9), I soon found myself in a dilemma. (Does any of this sound familiar?)\n\nDid God really know what He was asking when He commanded His people to observe the Sabbath, even making it one of the Ten Commandments? Is this really what He intended: \n\n“You are to labor six days and do all your work,  but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God.  You must not do any work” (Exodus 20:9–10).\n\nEarly on as I read the Old Testament and saw the countless times Israel refused to observe the Sabbath, even with the threat of severe consequences (Jeremiah 17:23), I wondered, How hard can it be to just stop and do nothing?\n\nI now see that God’s command to rest on the Sabbath is really a command to trust Him and live out the blessing of being His dependent child. My posture should be that of Jeremiah: “Heal me, LORD, and I will be healed; save me and I will be saved, for you are the one I praise” (v.14). Like Judah’s rejection of the Sabbath, my own refusal to rest shows my fear of trusting Him, of being needy, and my unwillingness to admit that I am ignorant of what is best for me. Resting is not so easy after all. \n\nHowever, Jesus has done the unimaginable by taking the curse for our stiff-necked defiance, and instead has given us the rest and assurance that we belong to our Heavenly Father when we receive His gift of grace. Now, we are able to “draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water” (Hebrews 10:22). We are now free to rest and “proclaim [His] love in the morning and [His] faithfulness at night,” (Psalm 92:2). We are free to enjoy our work as we revel in “all the great things He has done” for us (1 Samuel 12:24). \n\nWe are free. \n\nResting is hardly passive; it is making space to remember and really consider His goodness and faithfulness, and then proclaiming it to others, singing our praise unto Him. This is what my heart truly longs for. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nAfter retiring in Kentucky, my uncle took up pottery lessons. Over the year, our family began to acquire a collection of iridescent and cobalt blue bowls and flower pots as he experimented like a mad scientist. He loved working with clay for the same reasons most people do. It’s wet. It’s messy. There’s a form of childlike play to it. You can mold and shape it to make something beautiful in the end. The outcome of the clay is at the mercy of your hands. The same is true of us and our Maker.\n\nIn the beginning of Jeremiah 18, God says to the prophet: “Go down at once to the potter’s house; there I will reveal my words to you” (v.2). He sends Jeremiah to this house because by observing the potter’s wheel and clay, Jeremiah is given a powerful visual aid. Just like clay in a potter’s hand, the house of Israel is held in its Maker’s hands (v.6). The Israelite people aren’t as independent as they think. They are stubborn and make poor decisions. They abandon their commitment to God and defile the land with idolatry, making it a “horror” (v.16). They don’t realize how fragile they are and what they are risking in order to live according to what they think is right. \n\nIn Jeremiah 19, God tells Jeremiah to give a sign act to the people of Judah, which is exactly what it sounds like: a physical act that serves as a sign. He instructs Jeremiah to buy a potter’s clay jar, proclaim God’s judgment against Judah, and says, “Then you are to shatter the jar in the presence of the people going with you” (Jeremiah 19:10). The sign was meant to represent His intentions toward unrepentant Judah. \n\nGod takes great care to speak in ways we can understand. He’ll use everything from visual aids to metaphors to get our attention; even the world around us reveals His character. As we read through Jeremiah’s prophecies, may we trust that God knows what is best for us, and look for where He may be trying to reveal His truth to us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nHave you ever felt God place a message on your heart that you couldn’t help but share? Sometimes that calling arrives on your doorstep when you least expect it. That was the case for me when my daughter was diagnosed with Down syndrome. God has used her life to show me His deep love for all people, regardless of their abilities or achievements. My eyes have been opened to the shortcomings in my own heart, and in the heart of our culture, to affirm the worth of every human being because they are made in the image of God. I knew God was leading me to spread the word about how “perfectly and wonderfully made” people with Down syndrome are.\n\nSometimes the task God gives us is unpopular. The truth can be divisive, and by sharing the truth of the gospel we may lose friends, family, and opportunities. In some parts of the world, the consequences of faith are far more dire, putting the very lives of believers at risk for preaching the Word. The prophet Jeremiah was no stranger to persecution. He was given the dangerous assignment of calling Jerusalem out for their injustice and unfaithfulness to God. And while he was faithful to preach that message, it was not without internal wrestling. \n\nOne might look at the prophets of old and assume that witnessing is somehow easier for them than it is for you and me. We might think they liked the public stage and all that came with it. But Jeremiah makes it clear he would run away from the spotlight in a second if it didn’t mean running away from God too. So why doesn’t Jeremiah forget the risky business of prophecy and find a more convenient, safe way to serve God? Jeremiah is compelled to speak out because, as he said, the Lord’s message “becomes a fire burning in my heart, shut up in my bones. I become tired of holding it in” (Jeremiah 20:9). His heart is so deeply tethered to the Lord’s that he cannot waver from his created purpose.\n\nAs followers of Jesus, God places specific callings to our lives through the movement of the Holy Spirit in us. For each one of us, the big-picture calling is to proclaim the name of Jesus. But we have all been entrusted with unique circumstances and gifts that shape the way we point the world to Christ. \n\nWhat is the specific “burning” you feel in your bones? Are you being faithful to proclaim it? While it’s tempting to let the fear of repercussion silence you, look to the faith of Jeremiah for courage. He was a man who preached a dangerous message and experienced the backlash, but knew deep down he could do nothing less. The reason Jeremiah was able to be so bold was not because he was strong or special, but because he trusted that God is a “violent warrior,” one who could not be stopped (Jeremiah 20:11). That same powerful God is calling you and me to share the truth with the world in a very particular way. He will be with us every step of the way. The question is, will we let God speak through our lives?\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\n \n\nI’m sitting at my dining room table on the verge of tears. It’s been a good day, really. I slept in, made breakfast for my family, went to the gym, ate a nutritious lunch, and now, the toddler is napping and I’m sitting here, feeling so empty I could cry.\n\nSome modern-day advice-givers would be quick to point out my many blessings; for one, my family is intact and loving toward one another. Other people might try to help by pointing me in the direction of self-help guides, books to help me cope better because people like me shouldn’t be feeling any existential or emotional angst. Still others might remind me that the universe “has my back,” that in the end, everything is going to be okay. But is it? On the surface, my circumstances don’t justify this level of emotion. And yet, I have this sense, deep down, that something is wrong, that even though everything on the surface seems okay, everything on the surface isn’t all there is.\n\nThat’s what’s happening in this cryptic chapter of Jeremiah. The people of Israel had been led astray by false teachers—teachers that Scripture likens to “evil shepherds.” These teachers told the people that everything was fine. Even if they lived lives of evil, these teachers promised that God would grant them peace (Jeremiah 23:17). The false teachers encouraged people to persist in their godless actions, and when the people felt the inklings of sadness creep up—sadness that might lead them to repentance—the evil teachers distracted the people with stories of their dreams and false words wrongly attributed to God. \n\nAnd here’s something important to take away from this passage: God has no patience for people who speak on his behalf, and speak falsely. As I write this devotion that a large community of women from all around the world will read, I should take this warning to heart. Those who attempt to communicate truths from Scripture are held to a high, exacting standard. \n\nSometimes, a shepherd must strike the sheep with his crook in order to keep the flock together. Sometimes those are acts of mercy. Words of kindness and encouragement have their place. Words of discipline and correction are just as valuable. But I need a doctor that won’t sugarcoat my diagnosis. I need a friend who can look me in the eye and say, “Yes, this sadness that you feel is real, and it’s stemming from the fact that your entire life is structured around serving your own needs and desires, rather than serving others.” I need teachers who will tell me the truth, even when the truth hurts. \n\nWe live in a culture that longs for God to be all-merciful, all-healing, all-loving—and He is. And yet, over and over again in Scripture, He uses images like the good and bad figs (Jeremiah 24) to represent the reality that there will come a judgment day when our actions will be measured and weighed. Knowing this, the Lord again provided another way so that one day, His sheep will no longer be afraid or discouraged, nor will any be missing. He declared:\n\n“Look, the days are coming”—this is the LORD’s declaration— “when I will raise up a Righteous Branch for David” (Jeremiah 23:5).\n\nOur lives here matter. Our choices here matter. And when we go astray, our God doesn’t shout orders to us from afar to get us back to where we belong. No, our Savior came to us to provide a way to God the Father. And when we go astray, Christ doesn’t shout that He loves us from afar; He provides a way to God on our behalf, one that stretches between the Father and us. Through Jesus Christ, “he has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son he loves. In him we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins” (Colossians 1:13–14).The end goal isn’t just heaven someday. It’s being close to God right now, today.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jen Rose Yokel\n\nFor twenty-three years, Jeremiah pleaded for his people to pay attention. I wonder if he felt helpless as he watched his neighbors in Judah build their Asherah poles and bow to the stars and Baal. Perhaps he felt a knot in his stomach whenever he saw the shimmering idols, or laid awake at night weeping for the children sacrificed to bloodthirsty false gods (Jeremiah 7:31; 2 Kings 17:7–17).\n\nIt’s the same helplessness we feel when a loved one makes one destructive choice after another, or when we see the church we love caught up in shame and scandal. An all too human helplessness, knowing that no matter how much we plead, cry, warn, or rage, we can’t force anyone to change.\n\nNow take that feeling, that longing, and set it next to the deep well of sorrow and anger in Jeremiah’s words. See it as only a pale reflection of the depths of God’s broken heart. This hard passage forces us to wrestle with questions of suffering and judgment and anger. God is tired of watching this chosen nation waste their inheritance and love on empty idols. Instead of following the humble way—seeing their land as a gift and honoring the Giver with their lives—they start to imitate their powerful neighbors. With a king and some land and a little bit of power, they seem to forget their utter dependence on the Creator, and when prophets come along to warn them of danger, they shrug it off and keep living comfortably. Jeremiah laments, “You have not obeyed or even paid attention. He announced, ‘Turn, each of you, from your evil way of life and from your evil deeds. Live in the land the LORD gave to you and your ancestors long ago and forever’” (Jeremiah 25:4–5). In the end, they brought disaster on themselves (v.7).\n\nWhat do we do with the tension between this explosive message and God’s unrelenting mercy? Because for all these words about wrath and judgment, we know this broken path will someday lead to Jesus, God in vulnerable human form. We know further in the future, Jesus’s friend Peter will write once again about suffering, reminding a new generation that judgment and cleansing sometimes have to “begin with God’s household” (1 Peter 4:17). And we know that it is even so today, when secret sin is exposed, when leaders are brought low, when we find ourselves confronting the violent legacy of generations before us.\n\nIt’s sobering, but this suffering isn’t meant to bring shame. In this season of Lent, maybe it’s helpful to remember that repentance begins in the smallest of ways, perhaps with these two simple words: pay attention. Pay attention to your life, to the little choices. Do they nudge you toward life or death? Do they keep you humbly looking more like Jesus, or do they help you climb higher in the systems of the world? Repentance means, quite literally, turning around when you see yourself on the road to destruction. May we all join the weeping prophet in calling each other to a better way, and “entrust ourselves to a faithful Creator while doing what is good” (1 Peter 4:19).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nMy two-year old attends a sweet little church preschool a few days a week. This Christmas season, she brought home a nativity craft which met the fate of most crafts in our home: tossed aside, buried under mail, and found a few days later. My five-year-old daughter, who had discovered it as I was making dinner one evening, yelled from across the kitchen table:\n\n“MOM!” she giggled. “Is baby Jesus a potato?”\n\nI continued stirring the soup, and without even looking up, I chastised her immediately. “That’s not very nice! Baby Jesus is NOT a potato.”\n\n“But, MOM, look!”\n\nThen she appeared next to me, holding a small Yukon Gold potato, wrapped in tissue, with a drawn-on smiley face. Huh. Well, what do you know? In this scenario, baby Jesus was, indeed, a potato. I hadn’t even looked up, so how could I have known? How could I have expected a potato masquerading as the King of kings? \n\nThe priests, prophets, and all the people in Jeremiah 26 were a bit like me, stirring soup and not even looking up, jumping to an instant conclusion. Now sure, “You must die!” is a bit more extreme of a response than, “That’s not very nice.” Still, I know how many times I’ve heard something I just don’t want to hear, let alone deal with, and instead of listening, I react instantly, disproportionately, given the context. Honestly, this happens almost daily. As for Jeremiah, he had prophesied that the temple would become like Shiloh, a city north of Jerusalem that had been utterly destroyed by the Philistines. Psalm 78 recounts the tale: \n\n“But they rebelliously tested the Most High God, for they did not keep his decrees…  God heard and became furious; he completely rejected Israel.  He abandoned the tabernacle at Shiloh,  the tent where he resided among mankind” (vv.56,59–60).\n\nNo one, especially not the priests and people in power, wanted to hear that their city and temple would be destroyed because of their actions. Defensiveness reigned, and instead of hearing the word of the Lord and obeying, they tried to (literally) kill the messenger. But the Lord’s providence protected Jeremiah. A few officials stood up and spoke for him, reminding the rest of the group that the prophet Micah had made a similar prophecy (Micah 3:12), and when the people did turn and repent, the Lord relented. \n\nIn this story we see again, as we have so many times before in Jeremiah, a testament to the unwavering character of God. He does what He says He will do. Jeremiah believed it, and staked his life on it. He took God at His word; if the people would “correct [their] ways and deeds, and obey the LORD [their] God,” He would relent (Jeremiah 26:13).\n\nAs I read about Jeremiah standing there in the city center and proclaiming the unpopular, death-threatening message from the Lord, I’m reminded of Acts 17, when Paul stands in the areopagus in Athens and gives a similar message: “God now commands all people everywhere to repent” (Acts 17:30). \n\nThere are others in Scripture who faced a similar situation: Stephen died while proclaiming the history of God’s unfailing covenant (Acts 7). Peter was arrested for standing in the middle of Solomon’s Colonnade in Jerusalem and shouting the truth (Acts 3). Jeremiah, Paul, Stephen, Peter, and countless more before and after, risked their lives to tell the truth. In today’s reading, we see a few leaders who stood up and risked everything to hear it. Truth-telling and truth-hearing are two sides of the same coin, and we are called to do both as followers of the Author of Truth.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nI’m grateful God gives us earthy metaphors to help us grasp spiritual truths. Whether it’s using a mustard seed to represent our faith, sheep to illustrate the waywardness of human beings, or salt to reveal how we can flavor and preserve the world—God often provides familiar word pictures to drive a message home.\n\nIn today’s reading, God tells Jeremiah, “Make chains and yoke bars for yourself and put them on your neck” (Jeremiah 27:2). A yoke was commonly used to harness oxen as they pulled carts or farming equipment. Two animals would be placed side by side and hoops would be hung under their heads. The hoops would be strapped to a horizontal wooden bar placed across their necks. This yoke would force the strong oxen into submission and labor.\n\nJeremiah obeyed God’s instruction and strapped a heavy, wooden yoke around his own neck. How strange for a man to harness himself like an animal! The shackled prophet was a shocking picture of what God’s unfaithful people would soon experience. The nation of Judah would be captured, enslaved, and exiled to Babylon: Farewell, freedom! Farewell, promised land! Because of their insatiable idol chasing, God would use Babylon’s King Nebuchadnezzar to bring judgment. Judah would be forced to submit to a foreign power and to labor against their own will. \n\nJeremiah’s yoke was a picture of God’s severe judgment, but it also revealed God’s severe mercy. Even without Nebuchadnezzar’s invasion, the people of Judah were already slaves. Despite God’s repeated warnings through His commands and prophets, they had shackled themselves to false, foreign gods and they were blind to the chains of idolatry around their own necks. God longed for His people to recognize this bondage, turn away from idolatry, and return to Him with all their heart and with all their soul (Jeremiah 29:12–13). Only then could they really be free.\n\nWe all worship something. We all bow the knee and chase something or someone in which to put our hope. We may harness ourselves to health, beauty, wealth, family, achievements, or even our own good deeds. But worshiping anything other than God chokes the life right out of us. Our idols promise much, often the kind of peace we all long for, even the prophet Jeremiah (Jeremiah 28:6). And when the promise is made, the chase begins. Our idols fail to deliver, yet they demand more. As the chase goes on, we become more weary, despairing and defeated. But in His mercy, God interrupts our destructive spiral. He points us to the only one who, when we are harnessed to Him, delivers life instead of death. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nAre you sitting down? I mean, comfortably? Is everything in order around you—dishwasher running, floors swept, dinner in the oven, finances in order, the right color of throw pillows on your bed, exciting opportunities on the horizon, and peace within and all around you? Sometimes the stars align and all our circumstances seem to be exactly under control. I like to wait for that moment to start writing. Or to sit to read my Bible. I used to feel like I was waiting until I was married to really start living. But now that I am married with a family of my own, there’s always one more piece I determine to be missing from the puzzle—one more excuse to keep me from faithful obedience.\n\nIt’s hard to lean in and flourish when you’re waiting for everything to be perfect. Judah was in exile, living in Babylon, with every reason to give up and just spend years sitting angrily with their arms crossed. But Jeremiah calls them to walk in ordinary obedience, to be a blessing to the nation they are in. “Pursue the well-being of the city I have deported you to. Pray to the LORD on its behalf, for when it thrives, you will thrive” (Jeremiah 29:7). They had every reason to hate the Babylonians, but they were deported by the righteous judgment of God, who was now calling them to repent, and walk in ordinary, daily obedience. \n\nOften we want our repentance to be a single extravagant display of remorse. Then, after we think we’ve made a big enough deal about how sorry we are, we want everything to go back to normal: we want to have our own way again, and we want the consequences—the deportations, so to speak—to be reversed. But here we learn much about the true nature of grace and a relationship with God: repentance and forgiveness, obedience and blessing.\n\nFirst, true repentance isn’t focused on the removal of consequences. It is a return to obedience. Genuine remorse for sin produces a heart that turns away from sin and loves righteousness, no matter the circumstances. Second, God’s forgiveness isn’t really even about circumstances. We can’t judge our position before God simply by how well we seem to be doing on the outside. His forgiveness begins by changing our hearts and our spiritual position before Him. Our temporal circumstances are a secondary matter. Third, God calls us to obedience at all times. Repentance produces obedience, and grace bears the fruit of obedience. Obedience is the right response to every circumstance, whether good or ill. And ordinary, daily obedience—loving our neighbors, being fruitful, making disciples—is to be a continual mark of God’s people.\n\nWe are called to be a blessing, even to our captors. Though this runs counter to every human inclination, it should be no surprise. It is, after all, at the heart of God’s covenant promise to Abraham: “All the peoples on earth will be blessed through you” (Genesis 12:3), and in Christ’s command to His disciples: “Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you” (Matthew 5:44).\n\nEvery judgment of God is a gift of His mercy and grace. Even in a foreign land, God promises His people the grace of His presence: “I will be found by you” (Jeremiah 29:14). As He forgives their iniquities, He gives them Himself, and beckons them to share their knowledge of Him with the nations. This is the call that has gone out since the beginning of the world: repent and believe in the one true God. Be fruitful and multiply. Go and make disciples. For the kingdoms of this world will “become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and he will reign forever and forever” (Revelation 11:15, ESV). \n\nWe are all sojourners in a strange land, wanderers like Abraham, like Israel and Judah. Christ calls us to allegiance to a kingdom that is not of this world: to pray to Him and search for Him with all our hearts (Jeremiah 29:12–13). He calls us to remember that whether we are in our own land or in exile, we are ambassadors for His kingdom. The ordinary obedience of believers is perhaps the chief defense to a watching world, the beauty of the gospel pointing to the glory of the kingdom of Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nYou may have seen Siena, Italy, on the news, either because of the coronavirus-related quarantine in the area or because its residents were filmed singing from their windows in the face of such hardship, but it has long been one of my favorite places in the world. While Americans have football and the Super Bowl, the Sienese have horse races and the Il Palio di Siena every July and August. Not unlike our own strong team affiliations, these Italians are die-hard fans for their individual contrada, or city division. You see, Siena is divided into ten contrade, each represented by a horse and a rider donning representative colors and flags. \n\nThe race itself takes place in the city center, and includes three laps around the piazza which take roughly ninety seconds, on average. Yet it’s the most-anticipated and beloved ninety seconds of the year; the rest of the year is spent in support of their home-turf contrada, waving flags and supporting their horse and rider, as well as the division itself, a loyalty that is passed down through generations to enjoy and carry on into the future. \n\nIn Jeremiah 30, we read about another kind of communal loyalty to tradition. Judah thought they’d never see their own ancestral land again. God, however, had different plans, and a new covenant: “I will restore them to the land I gave to their ancestors and they will possess it” (Jeremiah 30:3).\n\nWhen I think of God’s people returning home, I can’t help but picture the reunion in the same style of celebration as Il Palio—bright colors, hooping and hollering, beaming with pride and excitement, as they “come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion… radiant with joy” (Jeremiah 31:12). Except this time, it’s God who is cheering on His children. It is He who is most excited to claim victory and freedom for His beloved and see them back home where they belong. Just as the Italians spent all year preparing for Il Palio, I like to picture God orchestrating the new covenant, anticipating radiant shouts of joy, long before His people returned home. \n\nAs we’ve journeyed through the book of Jeremiah, there have been warnings about the future and mountain-top moments of returning-home joy. But at the heart of this book and this Lenten season of remembrance and repentance is this: God can be trusted to hold both sorrow and joy, and He is faithful through it all. Thanks be to Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nConfession: often, when I read the Bible, I’m less interested in what’s happening in the passage and more focused on what’s in it for me: What does this passage mean for me today? How can it help, comfort, console, or advise me right now? But rather than trying to turn it into a self-help book that is tailor-made to fix all of my own personal problems, I need to remember that the book of Jeremiah is a prophetic book written to a specific people at a specific point in history, though it also gives us a glimpse of the new covenant (Jeremiah 31:31–34). \n\nIn Jeremiah 32, something strange happens. Jeremiah dreams that someone will come and offer him the chance to purchase a field. Sure enough, his cousin comes to him and offers him the chance to buy a piece of land. However, the timing of this land purchase is odd; while the entire nation of Israel is in exile, away from the promised land, Jeremiah is reinvesting in it, doubling down on God’s promise. In essence, Jeremiah’s actions are saying that even though God’s people are in exile, He still has plans for the land and for His people. Jeremiah’s purchase is designed to demonstrate his faith in God’s promised restoration, and in purchasing the land, he participates in that restoration. \n\nJeremiah’s prayer is simultaneously one of great faith and confusion. At the end of his prayer of praise, Jeremiah rehashes all of the disaster that has come upon Judah. Their city is under siege, sword, famine, and plague, and yet God has asked the prophet to do this seemingly ridiculous thing: to buy a piece of land in the middle of a war zone. But God keeps His promises, something Jeremiah knew well. So while he was perplexed by God’s request, he continued to act on God’s orders anyway. \n\nThough I should resist trying to translate this story directly to my own life, I cannot help but be amazed by Jeremiah’s willingness to follow the Lord in everything. He did not wait to completely understand God’s calling, to understand why, in order to obey Him. Obedience is hard, and the truth is, we need God to help us obey Him. \n\nLord, Your thoughts and ways are better than our own. Help us to trust you and strengthen us to obey You, even when we do not understand what You are doing.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nKids have an uncanny knack for extending their bedtime routine way longer than it needs to last. They try delaying the inevitable by distracting you with all manner of things, like missing pajamas, a long-winded yarn about a sibling, or a third reading of Goodnight, Moon. Unless your kid is one of those miracle children who quickly settles into sleep, as soon as you turn off the lights and shut the door, you hear it: the call of distress. \n\nSometimes you answer right away. Sometimes you don’t (especially if you know the routine like the back of your hand). Eventually, you may have to let the child’s cries for one more story go unmet for the evening, even when your heart moves with the desire to give in because, at the end of the day, you can only read Goodnight, Moon so many times.\n\nBut God always wants us to call out to Him in our distress. We see this after the word of the Lord comes to Jeremiah a second time and God says, “Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and incomprehensible things you do not know” (Jeremiah 33:1,3). Our cries for help are really opportunities for connection with Him, for sharing great and incomprehensible things with us. As with Jeremiah, these “things” aren’t self-evident based on our experience, but given to us as insight and revelation that comes from a life of walking with God. They come from a life of crying out to Him and waiting for Him to answer. Early on in life, Jeremiah received a crash course in this practice, one that was necessary in order to follow in the steps God had prepared for his life. \n\nThe Book of Psalms also features this theme prominently. “Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; he saved them from their distress” (Psalm 107:19). This call and response pattern repeats itself in beautiful depictions of God saving people from places of despondency caused by internal or external circumstances, and sometimes, both. Again and again, we hear God answering them when the time is right and with just the right antidote. \n\nGod urges us to cry out for help, like a child. We are His children, after all, and we don’t exist outside of His provision no matter how autonomous we may feel. Just like the familiar pages of a well-loved storybook, God longs to comfort us in our distress (Isaiah 30:18). Just as a parent answers a child in their distress because they hate the darkness, God wants to answer us in ours, to meet us in our need. His response to our affliction, and His timing, may look as different as the affliction itself, but He never leaves us in our distress. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThe last fire truck just disappeared down our driveway. Our woods have been thoroughly soaked with water and while my kids’ eyes are big, their stories are already even bigger. I can still smell the wet wood steam, and the wind is just as strong as it was thirty minutes ago, when a small bonfire caught the wind and flew across the dead leaves, spreading down the hill in the high winds before I could get it back under control. Everyone and everything is okay, but I can’t help but wonder, Could I have prevented this?\n\nI don’t have a great history with fire. When I was a child, I apparently left one candle burning on one blanket-covered bed and certain responsible adults still see fit to bring it up every Easter. (You’d think I would have learned, right?) But despite all of my past fire-related transgressions, I believe I should be forgiven these mistakes since everything turned out alright in the end.\n\nWe are accustomed to think of God’s grace as a “get out jail free” card, one that is indiscriminately available to cover whatever we can dish out. This is the natural bent of the human heart. We don’t really see all that much wrong with how we live, because we live in a culture of self-definition: I decide what is right for me, and no one should judge me for it. But what happens to that logic when we come face to face with a holy God?\n\nWe know what God’s Word says. But do we listen? God set before us the example of the Rechabites in contrast to the promiscuous culture of Judah under Jehoiakim’s reign. The Rechabites listened to the words of their ancestor, Jonabab, while Judah wouldn’t even listen to the Word of God. The Rechabites continued in obedience, generation after generation, resulting in God’s assurance that “Jonadab son of Rechab will never fail to have a man to stand before [God] always” (Jeremiah 35:19). Meanwhile, Judah continued on in their rebellion, despite repeated prophetic warning. \n\nThe people of Judah had so hardened their hearts that they utterly dismissed the dire warnings of God’s impending judgment—evidenced by the king throwing the warnings into the fire. In the context of this passage, this stubborness is shocking and disturbing. But are we so different? \n\nThe truth begins with tough news: Our hearts “are more deceitful than anything else” (Jeremiah 17:9). Acknowledging this fact leads us to the next unsettling truth: We have to deal with a Holy God. What can we do in the face of His righteous judgment? We cannot cure our own hearts, and He cannot abide wickedness, nor will He be deceived or mocked (Galatians 6:7). The hardened heart responds to the gospel like Jehoiakim: with denial and unbelief. Such a heart casts aside every warning, arrogantly dismissing the authority and holiness of God. And “it is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God” (Hebrews 10:31).\n\nThere is only the way of life or the way of death. Our merciful God opens the door to the way of life, even to rebellious Judah: “Perhaps when the house of Judah hears about all the disaster I am planning to bring on them, each one of them will turn from his evil way. Then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin” (Jeremiah 36:3). God not only offers an undeserving and rebellious people the gift of forgiveness, He also graciously offers blessing to those who hunger and thirst for righteousness and love to walk in His law (Matthew 5:6). Through His grace, God extends to us a promise not unlike the one He offered to the Rechabites: the ongoing blessings of His covenant.\n\nDo not harden your heart. Receive the grace available to you through Jesus! Turn away from evil. Do not throw His warnings into the fire, but instead live in the goodness of all He has given you. Because of Jesus, God will abundantly pardon, and grant you peace and joy everlasting.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI have two daughters, ages five and two. My two-year-old loves to eat and doesn’t understand boundaries, and my five-year-old likes to be busy, which means she leaves her food lying around in her wake. I’ll let you guess what happens more often than not. And despite my repeated warnings to my eldest—that if she leaves her uneaten food lying around, her sister will likely find and consume it—she continues to do the same thing, over and over again. Needless to say, tears ensue. I realize it’s probably not great parenting to say, “I told you so!” But really, what else is there to say? It’s a cause-and-effect problem, a black-and-white (and no gray) situation. \n\nWhen Jeremiah speaks to Zedekiah in today’s passage, there’s a similar sentiment behind the message, one in which a half-hearted response just won’t do. There’s really no gray area to wonder, Well, maybe that’s not really what Jeremiah meant, or Maybe the consequences won’t really be as bad as he says they will. But what did Jeremiah actually say? Surrender to the Chaldeans, and you will live. Don’t surrender, and you will die (Jeremiah 38:2,18,23). Over and over again, Jeremiah relays this message, then gets thrown down a well for saying it, only to then say it again. \n\nI find myself wishing that God always spoke this clearly. I couldn’t possibly count up all the seasons in my life when I have prayed desperately for clarity, for a sign in the sky, for a prophet to appear and speak with such thorough conviction. But even if God were to act in this way, would I actually believe Him? Would I, like King Zedekiah, come up with a list of reasons why I might possibly do the thing I was so clearly instructed not to do?\n\nZedekiah listened to the officials who said Jeremiah must be wrong, allowing them to throw him down the cistern. Later, Zedekiah was afraid of how the Judeans would treat him if he listened to Jeremiah and surrendered, and so he told Jeremiah to not tell anyone about the conversation. You can probably guess the outcome. The Lord spoke with conviction, but the king did not listen. \n\nWhile I wish I were more like Jeremiah, the truth is, I probably live my life a lot more like Zedekiah. I’m able to read God’s Word and then turn around and act in the complete opposite of its instructions. My conversation is not always gracious nor is it seasoned with salt (Colossians 4:6). I love money (Matthew 6:24) and put my hope in all sorts of things other than God (1Peter 1:13). I have very little self-control (Proverbs 25:28), and my heart is often bitter and angry (Ephesians 4:31). \n\nThe reality is that I want God to be clear in His instruction, but only when it benefits me, when His Word aligns with my self-interests and goals. When He is clear and it stings a little, or when He asks me to sacrifice or change for my good and His glory, I pretend that’s not really what He’s saying. But even though I see myself in the willful, self-justifying defiance of Zedekiah, I can rest assured knowing that his fate is not mine, because of the person and work of Jesus Christ. When I look to Jesus, there is no cost too great to follow Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nSuffering has a way of shoving cotton in my ears. When the going gets tough, I have a bad habit of convincing myself that God has stopped speaking altogether. At times, I find myself squashed by my perception that the Spirit has simply gone silent on me. \n\nBut then I read the words of Jeremiah, the prophet who spent his days weeping (with good cause) over God’s people and their disobedience, and I am reminded that God is hardly indifferent to us, our sin, or our suffering. Within today’s reading alone, just three little chapters of Jeremiah’s story, we find that his city of Jerusalem besieged as pagan officials laid in wait to accost his neighbors. The king fled and was captured… and then had his eyes gouged out. The sons and nobles of Jeremiah’s homeland were then slaughtered, and his countrymen were carried away into exile. And the cisterns that were meant to hold water were instead filled with the bodies of those who were slain (Jeremiah 39–40). Keep in mind: that’s just three chapters. \n\nJeremiah himself was left to live as a prisoner among the most destitute of his brethren. This single snapshot of Jeremiah’s story contains more heartache than you and I will likely ever know. Yet it was at that moment that “the word of the LORD had come to Jeremiah when he was confined in the guard’s courtyard” (Jeremiah 39:15). The sound of God’s voice speaking in Jeremiah’s darkest moment unstops my ears and reminds me that the things of this world, even the political upheaval of leaders, cannot squelch the word of the Lord; His plans will succeed. Suffering, imprisonment, and sorrows—none of these are a match for God’s power and goodness. There is no prison that can lock out God’s voice, nor is there a ruler who can censor Him. \n\nWith every form of comfort stripped from Jeremiah, what a balm God’s presence and voice must have been! The Book of Jeremiah is proof that there is nothing God’s children cannot endure as long as the Lord is still speaking. On every peak and in every valley, in times of plenty and in times of want, whether everything is coming up roses, or all we see is darkness—if we listen for the voice of our Shepherd, we will find that He is still speaking. He is not indifferent but engaged. God Himself is still wooing, always calling His children back to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nEveryone in the whole city wanted to know God’s will for them, or so they said. But when the Lord’s instructions didn’t match up with what the people of Judah wanted to hear, they quickly made up excuses to dismiss the message and the messenger. \n\nGod spoke through Jeremiah and told the people to stay put, but they trusted their own plans over His. “Surely Egypt will be better,” they arrogantly thought. Much like when Eve bit into the forbidden fruit, the people placed themselves on the throne to judge what was best for their lives. In doing so, they failed to trust God. It’s a mistake that humankind has made repeatedly since the beginning of time. But just as God was trying to protect Adam and Eve when He warned them not to eat the fruit in the garden, He was trying to protect the people of Judah. It’s important to realize that God wasn’t being controlling or trying to ruin their fun, rather, He knew that if they followed their own path it would lead straight to death (Jeremiah 42:22).\n\nI’m sure we’ve all asked God for wisdom and direction in big and small decisions. But can you think of a time when you weren’t really open to hearing the Father’s answer? Maybe you already had your mind made up about what you wanted to do or what you thought was best. But when God started to speak to you, were you willing to hear what He had to say? Was your heart ready to obey?\n\nLike Adam and Eve, and the people Jeremiah prophesied to, most of the time we are not setting out to purposely rebel against God. The problem is actually more deeply rooted in our hearts than that. The reason we struggle to obey God is because we struggle to trust God. While we profess with our lips that God is a good and wise King, our actions sometimes show that we put more stock in our own judgment and abilities to run the show. But just as it was for the first man and woman, and the stubborn people of Judah, our own steps unguided by the light of the Holy Spirit always lead to the dead end of death.\n\nWe must trust God more and trust ourselves less; He must increase, and we must decrease (John 3:30). None of us are perfect in this area. Not one. But we don’t need to figure this out alone. God knows this fault in us, and it’s exactly why He came to save us from ourselves. We have a rescuer who will go after us no matter how far we’ve wandered from the path. Like a good Shepherd, our God will chase down the lost sheep and bring us back into the fold (Luke 15:4). And bit by bit, as we learn to trust God to lead our lives, we will experience life, abundant life.Through communion with God, we will be “transformed into the same image from glory to glory” (2 Corinthians 3:18).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nIt is part of my parenting philosophy to never ask this question: “Why?”\n\nWhen my toddler draws all over the wall with a Sharpie… When my pre-teen opts to stuff all of his dirty laundry under his bed instead of in the hamper nearby… When my kindergartener bursts into sudden tears because he can’t find the green crayon… \n\nI’ve found that asking, “Why?” is more often than not met with bewildered stares, rather than deep, philosophical answers. And yet, in Jeremiah 44, when the Isrealites countered the news of God’s imminent judgment by digging in their heels, God, our loving Father, looked at His children and lovingly asked, “Why?”\n\n“Why do you commit this great evil against yourselves?…  Why do you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands” (vv.7–8, ESV). \n\nOur all-knowing, all-powerful God knew the answer, of course. But like all parents who struggle to fathom why their child would make a choice that leads to destruction, God voices His exasperation over His children’s persistent rebellion. The Isrealites in Jeremiah’s time were no different from us. Since the garden of Eden, all of humanity has been grossly warped by sin. Our very cells are broken; we run in glad rebellion away from the things of God. Like the apostle Paul, we are left to wonder, Why can’t I live the life Christ has called me to live? (Romans 7:15–20). \n\nWhen our questions lead to discouraging answers, and we face the fact that the destruction we read about in Jeremiah is a picture of the punishment we deserve, Scripture invites us to ask a better question. Not why, but who. Who can save us from our sin and spare us from the punishment we deserve? \n\nJesus! Our righteous Savior, who took the punishment we earned, so that we might be spared the righteous judgment of the Father. When the weight of our sin feels crushing and the reality of our rebellion overwhelms us, we don’t need to bother with asking, “Why?” Instead, we can rest in the hope found in asking, “Who?”\n\n“Who can bring an accusation against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies” (Romans 8:33). Jesus alone is the answer, and nothing can separate us from His love (v.34,38).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Maria Furlough\n\nSix years ago, on this day, I said both hello and goodbye to my sweet baby boy Gideon. Through his life and death, I tasted destruction and the threat of despair for the very first time. I moaned and wept as the walls I had built around my life came crashing down. I wondered, can God possibly heal this?\n\nThe words of Jeremiah chapters 46–48 detail another destruction story, one where we find despair in almost every verse, leaving us to wonder if hope for humanity is even possible. Can God possibly heal this?  \n\nThe people of Egypt “are terrified, they are retreating… terror is on every side!” (Jeremiah 46:5). The Philistines “will cry out, and every inhabitant will wail… they will be utterly helpless” (Jeremiah 47:2–3). The Moabites “will be shattered; her little ones will cry out” (Jeremiah 48:4). Darkness had fully overtaken these countries, and we learn why: because they trusted in their “work and treasures” (Jeremiah 48:7). And yet, for those who put their trust in God, there is a light that rises up. In the middle of the dark, destruction, and despair, we see that God has never left the side of those who call Him Lord.\n\nNo one in humanity is spared; death will reach each and everyone of us. At some point, whether Israelite or Egyptian, Christian or non-Christian, the walls of our lives, our cities, our possessions will come crashing down. But for those who do put their hope in God, we are not to be afraid because He promises to be with us (Jeremiah 46:27–28). Our hope does not lie in circumstances, works, or treasures; therefore, we have nothing to fear.\n\n“Do not be afraid.” These were the words my sweet Jesus brought to my mind every morning after Gideon died. In the moments when I was beating my pillow and pleading with God to somehow give me my baby back, He was with me. In the mornings when I wept at Gideon’s graveside, wondering if I would ever get up, God was there. This is the promise we have when we give our lives to Jesus. When we choose to follow God, when we accept Jesus’s death for us as atonement for our sins, and when we seek to follow Him each and every day, then even when terror and wailing come, we have hope.\n\nSo He’s shown me the answer to my question is, yes, God can heal even this, whatever this may be. And so it is within these passages from Jeremiah: Yes, God can heal this too. Therefore, we stand in confidence, and in all things remember that, “As for man, his days are like grass… But from eternity to eternity, the LORD’s faithful love is toward those who fear him” (Psalm 103:15,17).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nWhat’s the opposite of a banner year? Whatever it is, that’s what our family has experienced in the last year. Grief, frustration, brokenness, envy, death, and sickness stretched us out like a rubber band, taking us further than we thought we physically had the capacity to go. \n\nAt some point, every response started to seem rote, even the biblical ones. I stopped talking to certain people, because I knew they would offer a platitude that did nothing to assuage the torrent of grief and sadness. I longed for a true reprieve, a glimpse of the promise that I know in my bones is true: that one day there will be no more sadness and no more death (Revelation 21:4). \n\nThe brutal prophecies against the nations in the final few chapters of Jeremiah feel like that: unrelenting, devastating, impossible to withstand. Chapter 49 unwinds the devastations that were to come: the land of Ammon would be like a desolate mound; the chief city Bozrah would be destroyed, “an example for cursing” (v.13). Edom would become insignificant among all nations and uninhabitable (vv.15); fires would consume Damascus (v.27); Elam would lose the source of their power and be finished off, their kings destroyed (vv.35, 37–38). But then we read this: \n\n“Yet, in the last days, I will restore the fortunes of Elam.  This is the LORD’s declaration” (v.39).\n\nThere are short verses tucked in each chapter that promise restoration—the Egyptians (Jeremiah 46:26), the Moabites (48:47), the Ammonites (49:6), and the Elamites. And earlier in Jeremiah, God made a promise to His people, the people of Judah who had betrayed Him: “‘I will restore your fortunes, and gather you from all the nations and places where I banished you’—this is the LORD’s declaration. ‘I will restore you to the place from which I deported you’” (Jeremiah 29:14).\n\nThis is because our just God is also our merciful God. Even in the midst of judgment, executed in His perfect justice and righteousness, He promises to restore His people. He promises to restore their enemies. God is so big and so good. \n\nJeremiah is a study of God’s character. The reality of His grace and His justice is too much for our brains to comprehend. How, after all the things the Elamites and Ammonites and Egyptians and Moabites did to the people of God, could He promise to restore them? How, after all the ways His people betrayed Him, could God show them mercy? I do not understand it. But I know I need that same mercy.\n\nCharles Spurgeon, a British theologian and pastor, said: “God’s mercy is so great that you may sooner drain the sea of its water, or deprive the sun of its light, or make space too narrow, than diminish the great mercy of God.” It is this great mercy of our good and just God that we see woven throughout this chapter of desolation. Thanks be to Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nA long time ago, maybe fifteen years or so, my friends invited me to watch a movie with them. I didn’t check on which movie was playing—who even cared? We settled in, giggling, with popcorn and candy. Then I lifted my eyes to the screen and saw the most terrifying previews of horrible things I had never even imagined—in the previews! I knew for certain that I was not going to stay in my seat, essentially paying my money and my time to be tormented. \n\nThe fun and the danger of the world are balanced on a thin line. I wouldn’t have forfeited my eternal soul by viewing such a harrowing film. God isn’t going to yank away my salvation because of a party I went to in college, but our little everyday decisions do set the course of our life. It’s tempting to follow the course of the world and leave the course of godliness for another day.\n\nThis passage foretells the judgment God brought against the Babylonian empire. We see its fulfillment in the Medo-Persian conquest of Babylon during the time of Daniel. While Babylon feasted, the Medes and Persians invaded and toppled the wicked and unsuspecting empire.\n\nWhile there is specific fulfillment historically recorded, we also see with great clarity the character of God and His judgments against wickedness itself. As God called His people to depart from wicked Babylon, so He has always called us to be set apart from the world. While we are in the world, we are not of it. We are called to be a peculiar people, a holy priesthood set apart for good works (1 Peter 2:9).\n\nJeremiah’s call to separate from Babylon is set amidst an overwhelming series of warnings and foretellings of doom. The destruction of Babylon is coming, an unstoppable and devastating judgment. Here we see God’s righteous character, which cannot ignore the wickedness of the world; again and again, He condemns them for their idolatry. He will punish their “carved images” because “the LORD is a God of retribution; he will certainly repay” (Jeremiah 51:52,56). This idea of justice can make us a bit uncomfortable, but it is inseparable from the deliverance that God promises to those who trust Him. He cannot abide evil, because it is evil. \n\nThe lure of worldliness promises us gorgeous wealth, pleasure, and power. However, it will ultimately and inevitably result in the loss of what really matters. Lot was lured by the appeal of worldliness when he settled in Sodom (Genesis 13:8–11). It was in a rich land and offered ample opportunities for economic benefit, but as Peter reminds us, “as that righteous man lived among them day by day, his righteous soul was tormented by the lawless deeds he saw and heard” (2 Peter 2:8).\n\nGod’s call to His people to flee Babylon is a call not only to flee final desolation that comes to a wicked and perverse culture, but also to flee from the tormenting of our souls by a close association with worldliness. On the other side of this warning, we also see a welcome promise. God doesn’t simply call us away from Babylon; He calls us to something: \n\n“I will return Israel to his grazing land, and he will feed on Carmel and Bashan;  he will be satisfied in the hill country of Ephraim and of Gilead.  In those days and at that time—this is the LORD’s declaration—one will search for Israel’s iniquity, but there will be none,  and for Judah’s sins, but they will not be found,  for I will forgive those I leave as a remnant” (Jeremiah 50:19–20).\n\nHis promise is this: while the world offers happiness it cannot fully deliver—not for long, anyway—we find in Christ every satisfaction. He calls us to a place of rest and goodness, where the stain and memory of sin itself has been removed. He is the Shepherd of Israel, who leads us to quiet pastures, and to streams of living waters (Psalm 23).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nGrowing up, our family had two favorite traditions on Friday nights: homemade tacos and movies. It was a celebratory way to signal the end of a work/school week with two things that we could all get behind, although agreeing on taco ingredients was far easier than agreeing on a film choice. One night, we chose How Green Was My Valley, based on the 1939 novel by Richard Llewellyn. \n\nWe had absolutely zero context going into it. Spoiler alert: after spending two hours immersed in heartbreaking conflict, death, and thwarted love set in a grueling coal-mining village, we breathed a sigh of relief and pronounced it “the most depressing thing we’d ever seen.” The movie later became an inside joke in our family. Being more of the Singin’ in the Rain type, any time one of us would suggest another film showing, we’d shout from across the room, “As long as it’s not How Green Was My Valley, right?” \n\nWhether or not our unprofessional critique was a fair and accurate depiction of the story, this is what much of the book of Jeremiah feels like. It’s a rough read. The fall of Jerusalem is the last account in our Lenten study before entering into Holy Week, and in it an army sieges the city, and people are slaughtered right and left. However, though destruction, exile, and death are emphasized themes, the book ends with Judah’s King Jehoiachin getting released from prison and re-established in the presence of the king of Babylon (Jeremiah 52:31–33). Whew! Yes! At last! After such a heartbreaking saga, we end with gestures of kindness and mercy. But is it enough?\n\nMaybe it’s a bit of a leap, but we could say that Jeremiah’s conclusion foreshadows our knowledge this side of the cross that just when things look darkest, hope is on the move. God did not abandon His plan for redemption. Although Nebuzaradan burned the Lord’s temple (Jeremiah 52:13), Jeremiah and the people of Judah, Israel, and Babylon are just a few key players on a long timeline of history. Remember that God came as Jesus and allowed the temple of His own body to be destroyed so it could be raised and restored for our salvation (John 2:19–21). \n\nGoing into today’s reading with this knowledge frames the story in hope. Friends, as we finish Jeremiah’s story, let’s choose to find the incomparable hope nestled among the pages of its conclusion. Because, really, it’s only a temporary conclusion. Mercy is not forgotten. Jesus Christ came, and He is coming again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI love the exercise of doing something again. I like to read the same great books, over and over. I like to watch the same TV shows, or watch the same movies, and mine them for new gems. I’ve been re-reading all of Jane Austen’s novels over the past few years, and every book has been a delight. If books are prisms, then each new season of life has me looking through a different side, seeing how old and new insights bounce off of each other like light, making the experience richer and brighter each time I read. \n\nSometimes, reading Scripture is like that, especially reading beloved passages like the one today from Luke 19. Perhaps this is your first time ever reading the story of Jesus’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, kicking off the final series of events before His death. Perhaps you’ve read it dozens of times, and as you read it this morning your eyes skimmed over it, connecting only with the keywords you know to expect. \n\nBecause Scripture is a means of grace, it reads us as much as we read it. Like a prism, it catches light no matter when we look at it, and illuminates something deeper and richer. Scripture is living and active, which means that if we approach it with prayer, the Holy Spirit will guide us, and it will always reveal something to us. \n\nI can imagine the cries of the crowd who cheered for Jesus were staccato: sharp, loud, joyful, full of passion, short. “Blessed is the King!” they yelled, throwing their garments on the ground for His donkey to walk over. Not long after, the crowds would cry something different: “Crucify Him!”\n\nBut it seems that Jesus gave a legato response to the crowd: long notes, connected to a deeper understanding of His purpose. His statements reference the Old Testament: “the stones will cry out” from Habakkuk 2; and “For the days will come on you when your enemies will build a barricade around you, surround you, and hem you in on every side” (Luke 19:43), from Isaiah 29, Jeremiah 6, and Ezekiel 4.\n\nJesus’s statement, “If you knew this day what would bring peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes” resounds with wisdom and sadness (Luke 19:42). He was speaking to Jerusalem, the city He loved. He was speaking to the crowds who cheered Him and the Pharisees who challenged Him. He spoke with authority, which would quickly be followed up with anger when He cleansed the temple. \n\nLent, Holy Week, and Easter are a symphony, full of staccato celebration and legato mourning. We cheer, we cry. We celebrate, we abstain. We experience the fullness of life, death, and hope everlasting. We are Easter people, but we have the whole of the story in our bones. And every time we read it, we feel it more and deeper: the pain, the joy, and the glorious hope.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nWhy is Jesus looking for figs out of season? I’m not mad when I can’t get a good red strawberry in March—they are just out of season and I’ll have to wait. No hard feelings, you juicy little strawberries! We’ll meet again in summer. But Jesus sees the fig tree advertising with some glorious fiddle-y leaves and He assumes that those leaves promise fruit. Alas, the promise of fruit on this tree is an empty one. \n\nOkay, could we still be on good terms with a strawberry plant even if she were adorned in dark, waxy green leaves in early spring? Yup. No problem. I’d likely think it was strange, share the protein bar packed in my pocket with companions, and keep on hiking. So why was Jesus so disappointed in the fig tree, even angry at it? \n\nIf you read the immediately following verses, the judgment of the fig tree is a direct parallel to the judgment of the temple. In each case, God’s wrath is visited upon self-righteous hypocrisy, on those who feign life, but are empty of it. The appearance and the substance were in conflict; just like the temple in Jerusalem, it had the show of fruitfulness but was in fact barren.\n\nWe are all prone to boast good things, but less prone to deliver. And Jesus has our number: “You’ll recognize them by their fruit” (Matthew 7:16). Just as we ought to hunger and thirst after righteousness, so Christ as our Lord, hungers and thirsts to see righteousness borne out in our lives (Matthew 5:6). It is the fruit He is looking for. To find instead a vain and hypocritical show of faith, a surface religion, a pretended devotion, and hidden behind it a false and worldly heart, is an affront to His Lordship.\n\nThis is also a destructive act from the hand of Jesus, which is telling, as it should signify to us that which most stirs His righteous anger. The temple of our hearts is to be full of prayer, full of His Word, full of the Spirit of Christ. The temple of our hearts can too easily become a den of thievery, stealing the benefits of the gospel for our own gain, a showy righteousness that draws the applause of men, the lining of our own pockets, and the preening of our own pride. \n\nWe can look gorgeously leafy from afar, yet up close we are shrivelled and dry. But He is our spring of hope. With Him, our fruit looks like worship, obedience, and prayer. We ought to be full of juicy, bright fruit for the Lord. Whether we’re feeling like dry husks or like new blossoms, we don’t have to produce fruit out of thin air. Jesus is our source of life.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nHaunting images flashed before my eyes following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Burned into my memory is the image of a huge, steel cross that was found amidst the rubble of the collapsed World Trade Center in New York City. I’ll never forget the image of smoke and dust swirling around the scorched cross standing like a beacon in the midst of the debris, as rescue workers searched for survivors buried in the ruins. \n\nSimilar violence would have haunted the Jewish people who gathered around Jesus at the temple. Throughout this Lenten season we have grappled with Jeremiah’s prophecy of judgment and destruction that became reality when the Babylonian army invaded Jerusalem and demolished Solomon’s Temple in 586 BC. The very ground under Jesus’s feet had been battered and covered in rubble when the first temple’s walls fell. \n\nHundreds of years later, Jesus stood and taught on the same site surrounded by an opulent new temple, and He predicted that destruction would come again. “These things that you see—the days will come when not one stone will be left on another that will not be thrown down” (Luke 21:6). Herod the Great had spared no expense in renovating and expanding the temple. Despite the structure’s significance, size, and grandeur, the ground shook and the walls fell again when Rome conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the second temple in 70 AD. Jesus’s listeners couldn’t escape the images of wreckage and neither can we. \n\nDuring Lent, we pause and sit in the rubble. We choke on the smoke swirling from the sins and sorrows of the world. Natural disasters, wars, illnesses, and violence of all sorts bombard the globe. The dust stirred up by our own wrongdoing chokes us as well. Selfishness, pride, greed, envy, rage, and unbelief wage war within us every day. The cross of ashes smeared on many foreheads at the beginning of Lent symbolizes our lament as a people scorched by sin and sorrow and who need deliverance. \n\nThere is a scorched cross standing like a beacon for us too. The construction worker who found the steel cross after 9/11, Frank Silecchia, said, “I saw Calvary in the midst of all the wreckage… It was a sign… that God didn’t desert us.” Jesus has not left us in the wreckage of sin. He came to us, lived a sinless life, yet was persecuted and died on a cross like a criminal to pay for our unfaithfulness and mend our brokenness. He was battered and absorbed the attack that would have destroyed us all.\n\nScripture tells us that when Jesus died “the earth quaked, and the rocks were split” (Matthew 27:51). Walls fell down again. But this time, it was the walls of sin and sorrow that were demolished. The impenetrable walls that had separated a sinful people from a holy God were in ruins. By rising from the rubble, Jesus conquered death, allowing all who believe in Him to be saved and to live forever in peace with Him. This is our hope in a sin-scorched world: Jesus has come and He will come again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nGrowing up with two brothers, there were times I felt a little outnumbered. Once, I came home from dance class to find my favorite doll held hostage in a game of cops and robbers. Shrieking, I dodged foam darts to rescue her from the basement war zone. I sulked away, dreaming of ways to avenge my doll’s honor. I was in no mood to share.\n\nAs an adult, the things we hold most dear might be our family, time, or resources. But when someone tries to lay a hand on our precious commodities, you’d better believe we can still throw a toddler-sized tantrum. Our fists close tighter and tighter around the stuff that gives our lives meaning, and we lose sight of the only one who can bring true meaning to our lives.\n\nThere are many accounts throughout the Bible where God asks people to loosen their grip for the sake of the gospel. One such story is found when God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac (Genesis 22). We can all immediately recognize the costliness of being asked to give up a child. Abraham obeyed even that most painful instruction because he trusted God. Ultimately the Lord spared Isaac and provided a lamb for sacrifice, painting the illustration of things to come. God would give up His own perfect Son as the Lamb on our behalf. In doing so, God Himself paid the price we deserved. \n\nWhile many of us struggle to hand over our idols when pressed, there are some followers of Jesus who freely give without even being asked. Mary of Bethany (according to John 12:2–3) was one such saint. Nobody guilted her into an offering, and yet she took what was probably the most expensive thing she owned, a vat of perfume, and lavishly broke it over the head of the Messiah. The Pharisees criticized her generosity, feigning concern for the poor, but Jesus saw through their calculating hearts.\n\nChrist praised Mary’s extravagant gift, saying her act will forever be “told in memory of her” (Mark 14:9). Mary chose to live open-handedly, and it was counted as eternally significant. She gave away treasures on earth to store up treasures in heaven (Matthew 6:19–21). And in doing so, she built a legacy that mattered. Before Mary even walked the earth, her actions were affirmed in the wisdom writings: “A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of one’s death is better than the day of one’s birth” (Ecclesiastes 7:1). \n\nBoth Mary and Abraham earned good names for themselves by living as one anointed for death. We, too, are called to live anointed for death. Jesus said that if we want to follow Him, we must die to ourselves and take up our crosses (Matthew 16:24). As Christians, that means we must loosen our grip on earthly things and focus our eyes on heavenly things. \n\nWhen we think about the impact we want to have in our lifetimes, let’s remember Mary of Bethany, who poured out her gifts for the ultimate gift giver. By dying to ourselves and joining with Christ in His anointing for burial, we are covered in the perfume of grace. Then our legacy will become a fragrant offering of Christ to the world (2 Corinthians 2:15).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nMy good friend had hit a breaking point. After experiencing crisis upon crisis, she finally collapsed under the weight of what felt like too much to bear. A relationship had just dissolved. An EF-3 tornado ripped through her neighborhood, and she spent the next week volunteering with Hands-On Nashville relief efforts. There are financial struggles within her family. The COVID-19 quarantine suspended her classes and, along with it, the chance of getting into a music program for which she had already had four callbacks. In a moment of clarity, she realized while texting us that her birthday was that coming weekend—a birthday she would likely not be able to celebrate as planned.\n\nMy friend’s sorrows are personal, but she is not alone in her grief. Similar sorrows are shared by much of the world right now. There is a collective weight in the air these days. Can you imagine the sorrow Jesus must have carried during the nights leading up to His death? He had His own sorrow (Mark 14:34), but He ached for His friends as well (Luke 22:32), even as He prepared to carry the sin and sorrow of the whole world on His shoulders (Isaiah 53:4). \n\nDuring the Passover feast with His disciples—what we call the Last Supper—Jesus knows that sorrow will soon find them. Trying to prepare His friends for His death, He navigates the situation with delicacy and affirms the sorrow they will feel in losing Him, a close friend. He also reassures them that it will be worth it in the end. “You will become sorrowful,” He says, “but your sorrow will turn to joy” (John 16:20). This strange comfort is also for women who suffer the pain of childbirth (v.21) or Christian martyrs facing their own death after standing for a cause. \n\nSorrow isn’t a bad thing. Jesus experienced it as a natural part of the human condition. But even while affirming such feelings, He gives the disciples a framework for understanding their future hope—a future extending far beyond the plane of what they can immediately see. Yes, they must grieve His death, but that death was actually a seed that would unfold into new life. Jesus makes sure His disciples know with certainty that they will see Him again (v.22). Even if they don’t fully understand what He means, this changes everything for them, just as it changes everything for us.\n\nNo matter what happens in this life, we will see Jesus again. Because of the resurrection, those who hope in Christ Jesus will see each other again too. There is a time coming when every tear will be wiped away, and the burdens that we carry will be released (Revelation 21:4). The old will pass away, as joy triumphs over our troubles and swallows the pain of grief. \n\nIn Christ, we have permission to feel sorrow. But we also have the charge to walk forward in courage and expectation of our future hope. “You will have suffering in this world,” Jesus tells us. “Be courageous! I have conquered the world” (John 16:33). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nWhy did they crucify Jesus? Because it was a part of God’s eternal redemptive plan, for starters, but what did they write down in their court records? What was His crime? He was King of the Jews.\n\nJesus attests to this identity, as does Pilate, and later, the Roman soldiers. The magi came to Bethlehem, seeking Him by this title, and it was the written charge against Him as He hung on the cross (Matthew 27:37). He wasn’t the king the Jewish people expected, nor was He the king they wanted. When “Pilate asked him, ‘Are you the King of the Jews?’ He answered him, ‘You say so’” (Mark 15:2). He made no defense because it was His very person that offended, His Kingship itself is an offense to every sinful heart. The Cornerstone is the stumbling block, the rock of offense. They mocked Him as He hung on the cross, but their tongues unwittingly confessed Him as “Messiah, the King of Israel.”\n\nIn his letter to the Romans, the indictment that Paul brings against unbelievers is not that they do not know the truth, but that they know it, and yet suppress it: “For God’s wrath is revealed from heaven against all godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth” (Romans 1:18). Though He came to humanity in flesh and blood, “he was despised, and we didn’t value him” (Isaiah 53:3).\n\nPilate and the Jewish people did not need more evidence of who Jesus was in order to believe. They rejected the evidence that was right in front of them. Indeed, when at the end “Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed his last,” even this testified to who He is in such a way that when the centurion witnessed His death, the soldier said, ‘“Truly this man was the Son of God!’” (Mark 15:37,39).\n\nEach Lenten season, the Church remembers the long journey Christ walked to the cross. Each year, we encounter the same evidence, the same professions of Jesus’s Messiahship, the same hardened hearts that do not like the truth before them. The goodness of Good Friday is that Christ came to redeem blind, deaf, and rebellious people just like us. He came to bear upon Himself the guilt of our sin:\n\n“He was pierced because of our rebellion, crushed because of our iniquities; punishment for our peace was on him, and we are healed by his wounds” (Isaiah 53:5).\n\nThe goodness of Good Friday is that because He walked silently to the cross, like a Lamb to slaughter, not protesting the punishment meted out upon Him, we have hope. He was rejected by God that we might be made acceptable to God, a people for His own possession. This was the promise given through Jeremiah: “I will be their God, and they will be my people” (Jeremiah 31:33). See as the centurion did, the truth that is already before our eyes, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and He has purchased our salvation! Thanks be to God!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\n“I cannot even begin to imagine.”\n\nIt’s a response I’ve gotten used to as someone who writes about grief and feels it often. It’s all said with good intentions, of course, a nod to the gravity of the situation, but mostly, what I want to say in return is, “Yes, of course you can.” This life hurts, certainly we have all felt that. \n\nThere’s peripheral grief, the pain we find in tweets and headlines, feeling the loss of someone we once knew or will never meet. It’s the kind we pass through like a hospital hallway, guilty to be leaving so obviously whole, and yet, so unmistakably broken. \n\nThere’s nearby grief, sympathy pangs for the people we love and would trade places with in an instant. If only it could be us, we could tend to our own wounds and know exactly where it hurt. But instead, we visit, we sit, we wait, we do our best. \n\nThen there’s intimate grief, the deep aches that shape us and never leave us the same. This kind ushers us into an entirely new reality, where we wonder if we’ll ever find joy again. And at the same time, we also question if we’d even want to, if we deserve to. \n\nHoly Saturday—the day between Jesus’s crucifixion and resurrection—invites us into all three dimensions of grief, a display of just how heartbreaking this life can be. After Jesus’s death, we see the silent doubts of onlookers in the crowd, feel the loss experienced by His closest disciples, and intimately grieve Our Father’s separation from His Son. With all of this obvious pain, it’s no wonder we’re hesitant to believe the good-news promises that have been made to us. And yet, here’s the most important part of today’s reading: \n\nThe next day, which followed the preparation day, the chief priests  and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said,  “Sir, we remember that while this deceiver was still alive he said,  ‘After three days I will rise again.’ So give orders that the tomb be made secure  until the third day” (Matthew 27:62–64).\n\nAlthough the scene was full of grief and doubt, the tomb was still secured by guards. While they said they were afraid His followers would steal His body, part of me wants to believe there’s a bigger truth at play here: Even those who opposed Jesus believed there was a chance He would keep His promises. \n\nRegardless of whether we feel grief coming at us from all sides, or we don’t feel able to believe that God is who He says He is, the resurrection still comes. Easter still happens. Jesus offers the kind of mercy I cannot even begin to imagine or understand. Thanks be to God, whose faithfulness is good and whose promises are true. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nSpiritually speaking, we’re all olms. \n\nOlms are salamanders that live deep in the caves of Croatia. Because their days are spent in total darkness, they have no need to see. After spending generations away from the light, their eyes have become covered by layers of pink skin, rendering the olms blind.\n\nAs we read the account of Resurrection Sunday, the people mentioned move into the background. Our minds want to focus on Jesus, our resurrected Savior. But for the reality of the resurrection to have its full effect on our hearts, we also need to consider the ones who were too blind to see that their risen Lord was standing right in front of them. \n\nTake a second look at the apostles. Jesus Himself had told them He would not stay dead (John 2:18–22; Matthew 12:39–40; 16:21). And yet when they first heard that He had risen—just as He promised He would—the words of the women who’d reported the news to them “seemed like nonsense… and they did not believe the women” (Luke 24:11). \n\nThen there are Cleopas and another unnamed disciple, who literally walked alongside the risen Jesus on the road to Emmaus but “were prevented from recognizing him” (Luke 24:16). They’d dismissed the possibility of His resurrection, and even explained the events of His own death to Him. I imagine they sighed as they looked into the face of their risen Redeemer and told Him, “We were hoping that he was the one who was about to redeem Israel” (v.21). After they’d finished eating dinner with Jesus, “their eyes were opened and they recognized him,” and then He “disappeared from their sight” (v.31). And when Jesus again appeared to eleven of His closest friends, “They were startled and terrified and thought they were seeing a ghost” (v.37). \n\nCave salamanders—every single one of them. \n\nJesus appeared before them in His glorified body. He walked beside them on the road, stood in their midst face to face, and yet they simply could not see the truth about who He was. This is a picture of our true spiritual condition. Living with sin, generation after generation, has blinded us. On our own, we do not recognize our desperate need for the light of our Savior. Faith has become unnatural to us.\n\nYet, God has mercifully called us out of darkness and into His marvelous light (1Peter 2:9). He has given us eyes to see that the resurrection is not a fairy tale, and it is more than a historical event. God has gifted us the faith to believe that this is the moment that Jesus defeated death, so that we may be made alive in Him. \n\nJesus is real. He is risen. He is returning. Thank God! If you can peer into the empty tomb found in Scripture this Lenten season, and declare, “He is not here. For he has risen, just as he said” (Matthew 28:6), praise Jesus that He fulfills His promises. And then repeat the words of the blind man who was given sight, “One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I can see!” (John 9:25). \n\nAs you bask in the hope granted us on resurrection morning, consider anew the deep darkness Jesus saved you from, and celebrate the incomprehensible truth of what Christ’s resurrection really means for us: we have been remade, from salamanders to saints, and brought from darkness into His eternal light.\n\n",
