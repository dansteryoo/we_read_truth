They are designed to make us think about what is being said, why, where, to whom, and in what context. To get to the heart of Jesus’ parables, we need to pull them apart and take a careful look at the details He gives us. One detail that runs through this week’s selection of parables is that Jesus says they all describe the kingdom of God in some way. As you read through these passages, use the following questions to unpack the stories Jesus tells.\n\n//\nQuestions:\n1. This parable is similar to another called “The Ten Talents” (Matthew 25:14-30). What are some gifts, abilities, or opportunities you’ve been given to invest?\n2. What is the problem this particular parable addresses, and what is the outcome of the story?\n3. What is the central point of this parable, and what connection does it have to Jesus’ visit with Zacchaeus?\n4. What is your response this parable?\n\n                ",

You’ve heard the stories, but do you know them in their original context? In this 3-week study of the Parables of Jesus, we will read through many of the well-known—and not so well-known—stories Jesus used to teach hearers, both then and now, about how to live as His followers. Each day we will read parables in their immediate context, focusing on a different category of parables each week.
