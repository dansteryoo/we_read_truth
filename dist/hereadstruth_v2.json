    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The best stories end with good triumphing over evil, the hero saving the day, and peace being restored to the land. But the story we are living will have a greater ending still. God promises to make all things new and to bring goodness from every broken and twisted thing. How this will happen is largely a mystery. In the midst of this world breaking and twisting around us, the heartache and sorrow we experience doesn’t seem to contain even a spark of goodness to be fanned into flame. So this, of all God’s promises, may require the greatest amount of faith.\n\nThe Bible does give us a glimpse into the final outcome: a world where God dwells with His people and “grief, crying, and pain will be no more” (Revelation 21:3–4). That God could take the murder and theft and lies of this world and transform it all into a place that feels like heaven is beyond our ability to comprehend. And yet, we see it in the cross. The most broken and twisted thing imaginable—the murder of the Son of God—became the greatest good thing the world has ever known.\n\nThrough the cross, God has made a way for His goodness to permeate our world and overtake the curse we all live under. Every pain and hardship we suffer is being worked “together for the good of those who love God, who are called according to his purpose” (Romans 8:28). Though we cannot fathom how it will be done, we can trust that it will be, because we can trust the One who has made this promise. All of the promises of God found in His Word are as certain as He is good. He is the reason for our hope, and the hope of the Lord does not disappoint (Romans 5:5).\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The kingdom promise of a glorious resurrection can be a confusing one. It is hard to imagine a world where believers are raised in glory and power—their natural, earthly bodies having been transformed (1Corinthians 15:40, 42–44). The promise of glory stands in contrast to just about everything that we experience on a day-to-day basis here on earth.\n\nThe natural bodies that will be transformed in the final resurrection are the same bodies that endure all sorts of affliction here on earth. Similar to God’s promise to make everything new, His promise to make us glorious is the reimagination of biological life itself—a body without pain or hardship (Revelation 21). Inherent in this promise is an acknowledgement of the physical struggles we often experience on earth and a reminder that the pain and fatigue we experience will not last forever. The bodies of believers in this life battle sickness, heartache, and brokenness; in the new heaven and new earth, those things will be no more. Our bodies will “bear the image of the man of heaven” (1Corinthians 15:49), Jesus Christ. We will shine “like the stars” (Daniel 12:3), taking on a measure of beauty beyond what is possible in this age.\n\nLiving with this promise in view is an example of what it looks like to experience the already-not-yet nature of God’s kingdom. We have already been given the glory of having the Spirit of God reside within us (Ephesians 1:14), but have not yet experienced the glory of the new bodies we will one day inherit. That day may seem far off, but because of Christ, it is also a guarantee.\n\n                ",

This may seem like the easiest promise for God to fulfill, but for some of us it can be the most difficult to believe.\n\nSince the beginning, God has been our Provider, giving us the air in our lungs and the food in our bellies (Genesis 1:29; 2:7). But with the first temptation, our relationship with God’s provision has changed. The serpent convinced Adam and Eve that God was holding out on us, that it might be better if we provided for ourselves (Genesis 3:4–5). And that lie has governed much of our behavior ever since. We may still want God’s gifts, but in our sin, we want them on our own terms.\n\nWhen Jesus came, He modeled dependence on God, forsaking worry and the cares of this world for a life of contentment and abundance. He spoke truth to break the devil’s ancient lie, declaring that whatever we may build for ourselves on earth will crumble in the end; only that which is eternal—what is stored up in heaven—will last (Matthew 6:19–20). And He reminded people what had always been true: that “every good and perfect gift is from above” (James 1:17). God feeds the birds and clothes the flowers of the field, and we are much more valuable than these (Matthew 6:25–34). But greater than any gift from the Father’s hand is the Father Himself. As long as we have Him, we can have joy, for He is enough (Philippians 4:12–13).\n\n                ",

But there is a world of difference between the temporary freedom of summer vacation and the eternal freedom we have in the kingdom of God. In the Gospel of John, Jesus proclaims that “if the Son sets you free, you really will be free” (John 8:36). Those listening to Him were undoubtedly confused. In offering freedom, Jesus was implying they were somehow slaves, but they weren’t enslaved to anyone, not legally or physically anyway. How can you be set free if you aren’t in chains?\n\nApart from Christ, we are bound to our sin. This was true of the people in Jesus’s day, and it’s true of us now. Scripture is saturated with references to what life apart from Christ looks like. We were once slaves to sin (John 8:34) and ruled by death (Romans 6:9). Sin reigned in our bodies (Romans 6:12), and we stood condemned (Romans 8:2). But Jesus went to battle for us against the powers of darkness and came out victorious. His promise of freedom is a timeless one meant for anyone who comes to Christ. It doesn’t elapse or depend on our own merit. If the Son frees you, then you are free.\n\nOur invitation into God’s family is an invitation into an abundant life that is no longer bent low under the weight of sin. It’s an invitation into an eternal way of being, one where our sin is uprooted and cast as far as the east is from the west (Psalm 103:12). It is an invitation to freedom.\n\n                ",

The gift of God is not only the forgiveness of sins, nor is the gift just everlasting life on a renewed earth, free from sin, death, and pain. God goes further than that: He brings us into His family, with all the rights and privileges that come with being a child of the King (Galatians 4:7).\n\nGod’s Word says, “He has also raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus” (Ephesians 2:6). Notice that this is our current status. According to this verse, we have already been raised up to take our place beside the Lord. We are God’s children, so we have a seat with the family, right next to Jesus. But that’s not all. We are there for a reason: “so that in the coming ages he might display the immeasurable riches of his grace through his kindness to us in Christ Jesus” (Ephesians 2:7).\n\nHow could we even begin to calculate or imagine what an infinite God might mean by “immeasurable riches”? Peter described them as “imperishable, undefiled, and unfading,” and “kept in heaven for you” (1Peter 1:4). We will need to wait for these. But there is a greater gift still, and it is ours right now: God Himself. “And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, ‘Abba, Father!’” (Galatians 4:6). We get to call the Maker of heaven and earth Abba, the same intimate and familiar term Jesus used of the Father (Mark 14:36). Calling this news “good” doesn’t seem to quite do it justice.\n\n                ",

In the garden, God was tangibly present, walking with His image bearers in the evening breeze (Genesis 3:8). But that perfect fellowship was revoked when sin entered the picture, carving a deep, uncrossable chasm between fallen humanity and the holy Creator. Even still, “God with us” echoes throughout Scripture. The Lord appeared to men like Abraham and Moses. His presence filled the tabernacle and, later, the temple. And, of course, we have the prophets, who proclaimed that a Messiah would come to save us, forever restoring our relationship with the Lord (Isaiah 7:14).\n\nHe came just as the prophets foretold. Jesus was born Immanuel, the name that means “God with us” (Matthew 1:23). He is God incarnate, fully God and fully man, who walked among His people and brought the kingdom of heaven to earth. He is the Word made flesh—the living, breathing fulfillment of the promise who both restores and secures our fellowship with God for eternity (John 1:14).\n\nJesus’s disciples experienced the tangible presence of God with them, walking and talking in their midst. But the gift Jesus gave before ascending into heaven to sit at the Father’s right hand is the same gift He gives to us (John 14:26; 20:22). The Spirit of the living Christ dwells in all who have been saved by grace through faith in Him. He is with us—right here, right now, always (Matthew 28:20). Better still, we will one day experience that same joyful fellowship Adam and Eve knew in the garden; we, too, will live with God in a perfect, pain-free world of His creation. Jesus Himself is preparing a place for us, and He will call us there one glorious day. “Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!” (John 14:3; Revelation 22:20).\n\n                ",

But Jesus promised us something else as well: “You will have suffering in this world” (John 16:33). Read that again. That’s not You might or You may or You could. It’s You will. As sure as death and taxes and God’s love for sinners, we will suffer—Jesus guarantees it.\n\nFor many people, God and suffering are not compatible. If God exists, they reason, then there should be no suffering, for how could a good God allow it? But the true God is no stranger to pain. The Son allowed His body to be tormented and twisted by the most gruesome torture device of the ancient world, the cross. And He did so to put an end to the world’s suffering, once and for all. In the same breath that He promised us suffering, He made another promise, one so sure that it was spoken in the past tense: “I have conquered the world” (John 16:33).\n\nSin has so wormed itself in and through this world that we cannot avoid suffering entirely. It would be like trying to avoid sand at the beach. But we also suffer in a special way as Christ’s followers. We suffer because He suffered first. And when we endure this life and all it can throw at us, the same way He did, we display our faith that Christ has indeed conquered the world. For “if we died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him” (2Timothy 2:11–12).\n\n                ",

A foreign invader in this world, death is out of place and unwelcome. This is why we mourn at a funeral—because funerals were never meant to be. In the Old Testament, King David trusted the Lord to rescue his soul from the grave, resting in the hope that in the life after death, he would find himself in the presence of God, where there is “abundant joy” (Psalm 16:11).\n\nBut the hope of the Christian life is not only life after death; it’s much more than that. Yes, Jesus promised His followers eternal life, but He also spoke of a new life that starts right here and now. It is life with God, and it is eternal because God is eternal. Praying to the Father, Jesus said, “This is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and the one you have sent—Jesus Christ” (John 17:3).\n\nThis promised life is abundant life (John 10:10). And how could it not be? David was right when he wrote that there is joy in the presence of God. Through the Holy Spirit, we carry that presence with us wherever we go. Life is not easy, but we can be joyful no matter what happens, because God is with us. Whether we die before the Lord returns or are caught up to meet Him in the air when He does (1Thessalonians 4:17), the life we have in Christ will continue. “Where, death, is your sting?” (1Corinthians 15:55).\n\n                ",

Maybe you just imagine a morning when you get to ignore the alarm and sleep for an extra thirty minutes. The image we often have of rest is one of stillness and quiet, but what Jesus promises us goes beyond mere tranquility.\n\nThe rest Jesus offers isn’t a retreat, but a new way of living, drawn from an Old Testament concept called shalom. Shalom is more than rest; it is peace, wholeness, blessing, and connection to the Lord. This is only possible when we learn to rely on God rather than our own efforts, to cast our worries onto His back rather than piling them up on our own. This is the rest Jesus calls us to. And when we accept His invitation, we find His peace that surpasses all understanding (Philippians 4:7).\n\nJesus tells His followers that His “yoke is easy and [His] burden is light” (Matthew 11:30). His “yoke” is a lifestyle, a commitment to walk in obedience to His teachings and in light of His example. Jesus taught the way of the kingdom, complete with the pace and priorities of heaven, and He modeled total dependence on God, the key to true shalom. When we follow His example, we learn we can take His peace with us wherever we go.\n\n                ",

Judgment, punishment, destruction—these were the sort of words you might have become known for using. Sure, you would have also used their redemptive counterparts, like restoration and salvation, but often only after all the judgment, punishment, and destruction talk. When Jesus came along, He spoke words of warning like the prophets before Him, but He also offered forgiveness in a way that they, not being God in the flesh, could not. “For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him” (John 3:17).\n\nWhile some people were drawn to Jesus, many were offended by His words and actions. Scribes accused Him of blasphemy for telling a paralytic man his sins were forgiven (Mark 2:5–7). Pharisees were appalled that He let a notoriously sinful woman touch Him (Luke 7:39). Why did Jesus say these things and spend time with these people?\n\nJesus knew the Father’s heart, a heart that aches for sinners limping through this world under the weight of rebellion and brokenness. It had been His plan from the beginning to provide a way for sins to be forgiven. That way is Jesus. No matter how dark or scandalous our personal sins may be, God extends mercy to us—and to the entire world—because of the price Jesus paid on the cross. He laid down His life to secure pardon for every repentant sinner.\n\n                ",

Often spoken over another person as an encouragement to combat a disappointment or setback, the words can ring hollow when understood in their original context. That’s because God wasn’t talking about career success, dating relationships, or winning the JV soccer game. And He wasn’t addressing anyone and everyone. He was talking specifically to the people of Judah in exile. The “plans” God had involved restoring them as a nation and bringing them back from Babylon into the promised land. So unless you happen to be a sixth-century-BC Jew stuck in Mesopotamia for the duration, keep on moving—there’s nothing to see here.\n\nIn one sense, this is true. It won’t do to simply pick up a promise meant for someone else and take hold of it for ourselves or someone we love. But God has grafted all believers into His family tree of God (Ephesians 1:4–5; see also Romans 11:17). So the “future” God promised to His people in the Old Testament is now ours in Christ if we know Him, and the “hope” is bigger and better than anything we can imagine, because it is the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27), of eternal life in the presence of the King (2Peter 1:4; Revelation 21:3), and of all things being made new (Revelation 21:5).\n\nWhen faced with life’s challenges, the promise we have in Jeremiah is not that everything will work out the way we want, but instead that Christ will bring good from even the darkest moments this world can dish out. And in that, there is something lasting to hold onto.\n\n                ",

A thousand years had passed since God had made a promise to David, and it was the sort of promise that was only held onto because it had come from God Himself: “Your house and kingdom will endure before me forever, and your throne will be established forever” (2Samuel 7:16).\n\nIt certainly didn’t look like one of David’s descendants was poised to resurrect his father’s kingdom any time soon. Rome held the land and its people tightly. In fact, it was treason to speak of another king besides Caesar. Yet when Jesus began His public ministry, the coming kingdom was central to His message—only Jesus spoke of the kingdom as belonging not merely to David, but to God.\n\nJesus is the King who sits on David’s throne, but more than that, He sits at the right hand of the Father. And His kingdom is not limited to the land of Israel; it spreads across the whole earth as the gospel is preached and received, until one day when it will be said, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” (Revelation 11:15).\n\nThose of us who know Jesus as Lord also know the kingdom as the home we long for. In Christ, we are now its citizens (Philippians 3:20), and when He returns, we will reign with Him (2Timothy 2:12). Until that day comes, we join with David and every other faithful soul throughout history who has ached with longing for the promised kingdom.\n\n                ",

Moses had died, and now it was Joshua’s turn to lead—not because Joshua said so, but because God had said so.\n\nScripture does not describe Joshua’s emotional reaction to God’s directive, but we can infer from what God said next that Joshua was less than confident about the enormous task ahead of him: “I will be with you, just as I was with Moses. I will not leave you or abandon you” (Joshua 1:5). Put yourself in Joshua’s place, the weight of a nation’s survival on your shoulders and impossible battles before you. Let God’s promise sink in.\n\nGod was indeed with Joshua. In the chapters that follow, we see Joshua successfully lead the Israelite people across the Jordan accompanied by none other than the tangible presence of God with the ark of the covenant. And we see God fight for Israel as they take possession of the promised land under Joshua’s command. Everyone who followed Joshua benefited from God’s presence.\n\nBut Joshua’s life and mission point to someone greater: Jesus Christ. And just as God’s promise to Joshua was for the benefit of all those who followed and obeyed Joshua, the promise is extended today to all those who follow and obey Jesus. The Lord’s presence is with us, wherever Christ leads. We can, therefore, rejoice in the freedom from fear that is ours in Christ. “The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.

Cain kills Abel, even after God warns him about the evil lurking in his heart. And there’s nearly everyone else—“every inclination of the human mind was nothing but evil all the time” (Genesis 6:5). Who could blame God if He had decided enough was enough? But in Genesis 12, God does something tremendously gracious: He chooses to befriend an elderly man from Mesopotamia and bless him beyond all imagination.\n\nThe promises God made to Abram, later renamed Abraham, seem too big for reality: descendants enough to replace the stars in the sky, with kings among their number; a name known far and wide; and a piece of real estate approximately the size of New Hampshire. These promises seem so removed from our everyday lives that we tend to leave them in the past, there among the tents and flocks of Abraham and Sarah. But the New Testament tells us that these promises are actually ours in Christ.\n\nWe are counted among the stars in the sky Abraham saw, heirs of the blessings bestowed upon the patriarch in response to his faith (Galatians 3:29). Abraham is our father by the way of the promise, just as he was Isaac’s (Romans 4:17). We are even “kings,” since we have been given a royal priesthood (Genesis 17:6; 1 Peter 2:9). And the land? That may be the best part. In Christ, that promise has been transformed, stretched out, and enlarged. It now encompasses the whole earth (Romans 4:13), including the city of New Jerusalem where we will one day live with God, just as Adam and Eve did so many years ago in Eden (Hebrews 11:16; Revelation 21:2–3). In God’s promises to Abraham, Christ has transformed our failures into blessings, not because we deserve it, but because He is just that good.\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    There are two chief mistakes we can make when we read the promises of God, and they are equally dangerous. The first is to assume that every promise can be lifted from the pages of Scripture and applied directly to our lives. The other is to believe that nearly all of the promises came and went in the ancient world—that the only one meant for us today is the promise of eternal life we receive when we place our trust in Christ. Neither approach is biblical, though, for Scripture says that, “no matter how many promises God has made, they are ‘Yes’ in Christ” (2Corinthians 1:20 NIV).\n\nAnd of course they are! How else would the plans of our “compassionate and gracious God” work (Exodus 34:6)? When every story in the Old Testament points forward to the coming of the Son of God, and every word in the New Testament is a response to His life and work, we should not be surprised to find that every promise is indeed “Yes” in Christ.\n\nNot only that, but all the promises in the Old Testament—the ones we thought were surely over and done with, or meant only for ethnic Israel—are transformed and enlarged in the wake of Christ’s ministry. In many cases, the New Testament writers help us see the way these promises are renewed in Christ. In this way, learning about the promises of God becomes a means of deepening our understanding of Christ and His work, and an occasion to worship our great Savior.\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Some mornings, I still instinctively reach over to the dresser beside my bed in search of my glasses. My hand fumbles its way across my keys, wallet, and phone before I realize there are no frames to be found. Four years ago, I had LASIK eye surgery, which eliminated my need for corrective lenses. But in those moments between asleep and awake, I sometimes forget. You see, from the time I was nine months old until the morning of my surgery, I wore glasses. Every day. Without them, the world was a blurry, headache-inducing mess. Still, it can be difficult to adjust to a new way of seeing the world.\n\nHere at the end of Ecclesiastes, we are invited into a new way of seeing. Up until this point, everything has been viewed from a perspective trapped “under the sun,” a phrase used twenty-seven times in the book. But there is another view: God’s vantage from above the sun. He is the only one who can “declare the end from the beginning” (Isaiah 46:10), whose ways are higher than ours (Isaiah 55:8–9), and who “will bring every act to judgment, including every hidden thing, whether good or evil” (Ecclesiastes 12:14).\n\nThough on our own we would stumble around this world with a limited perspective, God’s Word gives us a pair of lenses to see the world as He does. That’s why reading Ecclesiastes can be so disheartening to many Bible readers. It’s like taking off a pair of glasses we’ve worn every day of our lives. Solomon shows us the world without corrective lenses, without eye surgery. It’s just the raw, blurry, dismal picture of life under the sun without the aid of divine help.\n\nIn that there is goodness, a chance to see the true brokenness and despair of this world, so that we might also recognize the grace of God for what it is—miraculous and lavish. That is why Solomon can say, even of the dark message of Ecclesiastes, “The sayings are given by one Shepherd” (Ecclesiastes 12:11), while he loudly declares, “Absolute futility.… everything is futile” (v.8). There is one who is coming to bring meaning out of meaninglessness and purpose out of futility. He is making all things new, working all things together for the good of those who love Him (Revelation 21:5; Romans 8:28).\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

If you’ve been around a walking, talking toddler, you know which ones get said the most: Mine, mine, mine. When a toddler thinks everything is theirs and they roll out their army of mines, it’s funny, even cute—and then we teach them the truth. No one looks at the toddler and thinks they have derailed and have no grasp on life. But when an adult lives from the “mine” mindset, it’s a disaster.\n\nSolomon reminds us that we are not the Creator, and therefore, we don’t have ultimate possession, power, or patents on anything under the sun. It’s all God’s. We are called to be wise stewards of the things God has put under our care, and wisdom staves off a propensity for greediness.\n\nWhen Solomon talks about throwing bread on the water, his listeners would have immediately understood him. For us, however, it’s an odd phrase. If you threw bread on the water, ducks at the park would just snatch it up and then chase you. Solomon’s phrase is an ancient, near eastern way of saying, Be generous. It all comes back around. It’s not a waste to be kind, to be gracious, and give to others. Solomon’s next words are sobering: “You don’t know what disaster may happen” (Ecclesiastes 11:2). So “in the morning sow your seed, and at evening do not let your hand rest” (v.6).\n\nIf you are stingy toward others, disaster might come, making it too late for you to help them. Or the inverse, you might lose it all before you could have helped others. Have you been thinking about blessing someone in your small group? Cast that bread. You’ve been thinking about giving to a cause that stirs your heart? Go ahead and cast your cash on the waters. Thinking about generosity is no substitute for actually being generous. Don’t just stare at the clouds: do it—share the bread—don’t wait.\n\nSolomon pivots for a second and points us to the womb, reminding us that we don’t fully comprehend the generous grace of God at work in this world and in our lives, but it compels us in the here and now. God’s grace motivates us to repent of sin. His kindness reminds us to rejoice. And living out the wisdom of God will cause us to love our neighbors as ourselves. We will meet needs, we will seek to bless others, we will make sacrifices for and and seek the good of others—just like Jesus did for us on Easter weekend. Cast your bread, like our Savior did through His body and blood, for the good of others. Let’s humble ourselves, serve one another, and wait for His glorious return and His coming kingdom.\n\nWritten by Jeff Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    One of the most profound lines in cinematic history was said by a simple man on a park bench: “Stupid is as stupid does.” Solomon would likely agree with these words from Forrest Gump. In today’s reading, Solomon outlines all of the ways that folly plays out in this world. Brothers, may this passage today be a reminder for how seriously we must take the pursuit of wisdom. Leave folly—the stupidity of sin—and pursue Christ who is our wisdom.\n\nSolomon has noticed the burden that foolishness creates in its wake. He begins by illustrating for us the effects of folly: A perfectly wonderful perfume can be ruined by a few dead flies (Ecclesiastes 10:1). Seeing how most of us aren’t buying perfume in an ancient, open-air marketplace, perhaps this scenario hits closer to home: A five-star meal can be ruined by one baby roach.\n\nThat ring a bell? See, Solomon is showing us how good things get ruined by things that don’t belong. It doesn’t even have to be the quantity of bad things ruining the good thing—sometimes one is enough. Some folly is so severe that all it takes is one occurrence to ruin it all. One night with someone who’s not your spouse. One fit of rage, lashing out at a coworker. One lie. One night of getting drunk with buddies could cost you more than the bar tab. That really good thing you’ve got going at work? Just one act of folly could ruin it all.\n\nOn the other side, there is another kind of folly, a kind of cruel irony that could come upon us in this fallen world, even an accident. A guy digging a pit could fall in and die. A man gathering stones could be crushed by them. We know this reality too. We hear about the tragedies on the news and on social media. We see the folly and the fallout when rulers are either not qualified to rule, or they don’t know how to lead with wisdom. These kinds of rulers and leaders burden people far more than they build them up. Folly is both a fuel and a fruit of this present age.\n\nBut there is hope. In the midst of all “the vapor” of this life, the words of a wise person, a person clued in to the reality of God and His ways, will be an act of grace to those who have been affected by folly (Ecclesiastes 10:12). You can offer a simple sentence from God’s Word about forgiveness, and ease the burden off someone’s back. You can point out the cross and the empty tomb of Christ to a burdened sinner, and share His words with them: “Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). This world is full of folly—it doesn’t need anymore. The world needs your words of grace, which are echoes from your gracious Savior.\n\nWritten by Jeff Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    A day will come for all of us when we are separated from the ones we love most. This is heartbreaking. It was never meant to be this way. Death was not a part of the design specs of the garden of Eden, and this is why death affects us so deeply; our minds and hearts were not engineered to handle the effects of death. But God has wisdom for us, and through Solomon, has given counsel for navigating “the vapor” that is life under the sun (Ecclesiastes 1:2–4).\n\nKing Solomon tells us to enjoy life while we’re living it. Plain, simple, to the point. We are to look at what God has given us—the blessings we acknowledge and everything we take for granted—and maximize our joy in those gifts from Him. We are to leverage them to care for His Church, and in the process, He makes us more aware of what we’ve been given: “The righteous, the wise, and their works are in God’s hands” (Ecclesiastes 9:1). Solomon tells us to savor our meals, to tell stories and clank our glasses with friends, looking into the eyes of our fellow image-bearers. Why? Because it won’t always be like this. These moments are fleeting, so grab them now.\n\nWisdom in this life involves more than just fighting sin; wisdom also means fully living the life God has given us. Because of Jesus’s death and rising, we realize it’s not unspiritual to enjoy life—it’s actually biblical—for the glory of God and for our good. Jesus defeating death shows us that God doesn’t ignore the beauties of physical human life; He redeems them. Therefore, we ought to enjoy them and give thanks for them in the moment, which is an act of those who are fully alive, “for the living know that they will die” (Ecclesiastes 9:5).\n\nThis does not mean that we can shirk our responsibilities in pursuit of our own personal pleasure and comfort—that’s worldliness. Disciples of Christ discover joy in the ordinariness of life. Today, resolve to be present and relish in what you have been given from God, enjoying and acknowledging “every good and perfect gift” from “the Father of lights, who does not change like shifting shadows,” despite our circumstances (James 1:17).\n\nWhatever you do in this life, do it all the way. Whatever it is that you’ve been called to do for work, family, church—do it with all your strength (Ecclesiastes 9:10). Life’s too fleeting for half-measures and good intentions. Both are ultimately empty acts, and Jesus came so that each of us “may have life and have it in abundance” (John 10:10). Love and live fully, laugh until you cry, embrace those around you. Enjoy life today, remembering that it is a vapor, but that in our God’s presence are abundant joys and eternal pleasures (Psalm 16:11).\n\nWritten by Jeff Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    One summer, three friends and I strapped on our backpacks to hike the irrigation trail up the side of a canyon wall. This one canyon is a popular hiking spot because of its proximity to the Foresthill Bridge, the fourth highest bridge in the United States.\n\nHalfway up the mountain, nausea hit. Due to the intermingling of 90-degree heat and a limited water supply, I felt instant regret over suggesting this vertical trail that wasn’t even meant for hiking. (It’s an irrigation trail, after all.) Wisdom sure wasn’t the one leading the charge in this decision; it was my own ego and the myth of invincibility. After we almost passed out from dehydration, two of my friends had to shoulder my body weight and help carry me the rest of the way.\n\nScripture says that “a person’s wisdom brightens his face” (Ecclesiastes 8:1). At the time when Ecclesiastes was written, wisdom was attributed as coming from a divine source. A bright face was considered physical evidence of wisdom in the wise person’s life, just as Moses’s face shone with radiance after spending time with the Lord (Exodus 34:34–35).\n\nOur faces today may not emit a visible shining substance when we make good decisions or spend quality time with the Lord. But wisdom lingers with us the way campfire smoke stays on your clothes after hours roasting the perfect marshmallows. It favorably directs our steps and will be evident in our lives when we exercise it. Since our thoughts and actions affect those we are in community with, when we use wisdom in decision-making, we can also bring life to our collective environments. In doing so, perhaps our sphere of the world can better operate by kingdom values, such as justice, mercy, and love.\n\nProverbs offers the encouragement that “remembrance of the righteous is a blessing” (Proverbs 10:7). Those who live from a place of wisdom—whose faces are “brightened” by the Spirit of the Living God—are a blessing. It’s not that the wise avoid folly altogether. They just learn from their mistakes. As Jesus-followers, if our aim is to pursue abundant life, our lives will be marked by years that smell like wisdom.\n\nIn the end, climbing a mountain on a 90-degree day probably wasn’t wise. While our faces may have glistened, it wasn’t from nearing the Mount of Transfiguration, but from perspiring pearls of sweat that mocked our foolish decision. You’d better believe we learned from that mistake and will only plan future hikes up paths that are intended for human recreation.\n\nWritten by Bailey Gillespie\n\n               ",

It’s as if every experience opens up the possibility of ten thousand new questions they couldn’t have conceived of before. Their hunger for understanding is innocent. Their curiosity drives their inquisitiveness.\n\nThere are times when I do not have answers for their questions. There are times when my answers are not enough. And sometimes, I do not answer their questions intentionally. They are not mature enough to carry the burden of knowledge for certain things. And they often get irritated with me when there is no satisfactory answer.\n\nEven as adults, there are limits to what we can know and understand. Wisdom also teaches us that there are limits to what we need to know and understand. “What exists is beyond reach and very deep. Who can discover it?” (Ecclesiastes 7:24). Not accepting this reality often reveals sinful pride, and attempting to sinfully push beyond these boundaries often leads to despair.\n\nThankfully, the Teacher of Ecclesiastes is a steady guide for those who want to grow into wisdom. As a friend of mine often says, “We do not have to learn from our own mistakes. We can learn from others’ mistakes as well.” In the pursuit of ultimate wisdom, the Teacher turned his thoughts to learning, exploring, and examining wisdom. The Teacher was on the endless pursuit of investigating all that could be known. Sounds a bit overwhelming, doesn’t it?\n\nWhat did he discover? He discovered that in the vast majority of situations and relationships, he was unable to fully comprehend life. In the end, even the wisest man in all of history could not figure out all of reality.\n\nInterestingly enough, he uses the metaphor of a seductive mistress to exemplify his quest for ultimate knowledge, realizing how prideful and foolish he was to assume that he could scale to the heights of becoming all-wise. There is a certain childlike humility that comes with realizing that even our God-given wisdom has limits. Only God is all-wise. No human being possesses the capacity to fully understand His plan and program.\n\nThere is good news, however! Scripture teaches us that Jesus is the true wisdom of God; in Him God has provided us with salvation from our own sinful pursuits and the seductions of this world. The one who humbly admits their own limitations and needs is the one who is truly wise, for they are ready to lean on Christ.\n\nEven more, like a loving Father, God has revealed all that we need to know for a life of godliness. His sacred Scripture is not exhaustive; there are certainly things that remain a mystery. However, the answers He has given us are more than sufficient to allow us to trust Him and obey His commands.\n\nIt can be difficult to trust God over our own limited knowledge of circumstances. It seems counterintuitive to walk in obedience to His commands when by all appearances, we think we can take the situation into our own hands and follow our deceptive hearts. How sweet is the benevolence of God when compared to the bitter death of pursuing understanding without Him.\n\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The 2003 documentary Born Rich surveys the lives of the children of extremely wealthy and influential business owners in America. Most of those who inherited an enormous amount of wealth from their parents or grandparents end up squandering it and ruining their lives. No matter how much financial freedom is gained, it doesn’t protect against living a reckless and unfulfilled life.\n\nThe Bible has much to say about the importance of an inheritance. The idea of the firstborn son gaining an inheritance from his father is integral to God’s plan in redemptive history. Whether it was in the families of the patriarchs, or among the inhabitants of Israel, gaining and keeping an inheritance was a large part of the lives and experiences of God’s people. There was, of course, a spiritual dimension to the Old Testament allusions to inheritance. The earthly inheritance pointed forward to the eternal inheritance purchased for us by Christ on the cross. Jesus came into the world to be the heir of all things, and to graciously make His people heirs of the everlasting inheritance that He secured. But there is something else that Scripture likens to the value of an earthly inheritance in this world, namely, wisdom.\n\nEcclesiastes 7:11–12 says, “Wisdom is as good as an inheritance… protection as silver is protection; but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner.” In a chapter that speaks directly about the dangers of money (v.7), we find an unexpectedly positive statement in which wisdom is likened to money. The comparison between wisdom and an inheritance teaches us that wisdom is a spiritual commodity for life in this fallen world. We need wisdom for every facet of our lives. This is an important principle for us to learn, when we consider what ought to be of most importance to us in this life. There are also the tangible benefits of protection and safety that are gained in the pursuit of wisdom; If we incline our hearts to godly wisdom, we will avoid great evils under the sun.\n\nNo one had more wealth or wisdom than Solomon, but the king had far more still; he’d inherited a kingdom that was more glorious than others in his day. More important than material goods, the Lord gave Solomon a wise and understanding heart, and so he learned to value wisdom more than riches. Still, he cautions, “Don’t be excessively righteous, and don’t be overly wise” (Ecclesiastes 7:16). Instead, we ought to seek balance, because when it comes to the pursuit of wisdom and knowledge, we must learn to be content with the utter impossibility of knowing everything. Our contentment will never come from knowing or learning more; the beginning of true wisdom can only come in fearing and revering our God (Proverbs 9:10).\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    When I was a boy, I loved to watch the popular television show, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. In each episode, host Robin Leach gave a virtual tour of mansions, properties, automobiles, and vacations. Focusing on all that the wealthy could afford in this life, the show held out the prospect of affluence and success. It would be interesting to interview people who were on the show thirty years ago to find out where they are today. How many of them would we discover have suffered the pain of family strife, broken marriages, bankruptcy, sickness, crime, and loneliness?\n\nScripture often reminds us about the futility of wealth and its inability to satisfy. The book of Ecclesiastes gives us a survey of what the Russian poet Pushkin called “a heart of pain.” The Teacher writes, “There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy on mankind: a man to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity; it is a grievous evil” (Ecclesiastes 6:1–2, ESV). The man in these verses seemed to have it all. He had everything that most people are seeking after: wealth and fame. Yet, for all his possessions and status, he was never able to enjoy them or be satisfied by them.\n\nSo often, we foolishly convince ourselves that if we just made a little more money or achieved a little more success, we would be happy. The moral of this story is that the ability to amass wealth and the power to enjoy it both come from God, and the one does not necessarily follow the other. The Teacher has been speaking about life under the sun here on earth. When we look to the things of this world for pleasure, we will find ourselves unsatisfied. However, when we look to God for satisfaction, we will find that we can even enjoy and utilize possessions for His glory. The apostle Paul gave Timothy instruction about how to address the wealthy Christians in his congregation, saying, “Instruct those who are rich in the present age not to be arrogant or to set their hope on the uncertainty of wealth, but on God, who richly provides us with all things to enjoy” (1Timothy 6:17).\n\nWhen we discover the kingdom of heaven is the treasure in the field and the pearl of great price, we learn to place worldly possessions and pleasures into their proper place (Matthew 13:44–46). Only then will we not spend our lives running after them. Instead, we will learn to find satisfaction in God alone as “those who use the world as though they did not make full use of it. For this world in its current form is passing away” (1Corinthians 7:31).\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The better part of our lives is filled with conversations. Whether talking about work, school, family, homes, technology, travel, shopping, food, movies, athletes, or music—words fill our experience as God’s image-bearers in this world. A seemingly endless amount of communication steadily streams across our computers and televisions; we cannot imagine a world without speech. Yet Ecclesiastes has much to say about how our words reflect what we think in our hearts. As Jesus taught, our mouths speak “from the overflow of the heart” (Luke 6:45). Both the wise man and the fool are revealed by what they say. Today’s reading gives three warnings around our speech.\n\nFirst, we need to prioritize listening to God’s Word over our own words and understanding: “Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Better to approach in obedience than to offer the sacrifice as fools do, for they ignorantly do wrong” (Ecclesiastes 5:1). God is not impressed by big sacrifices; He desires humility and obedience. Our worship of God reflects what we understand about who He is; therefore, we should be quick to listen to what God has spoken in His Word.\n\nSecond, “Do not be hasty to speak, and do not be impulsive to make a speech before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few” (v.2). The author is not calling us to merely reduce the number of our words. Rather, he is charging us to consider whether we are speaking sincere words before and about God. In the same way that God isn’t moved by flashy sacrifices, He isn’t fooled by bold speeches or public declarations that don’t reflect the reality of our hearts. As pastor and theologian Charles Bridges explained, “The fewness of the words is not the main concern; but whether they be the words of the heart.”\n\nThree, we should approach vows with the utmost sobriety. Many treat vows as formalistic rituals without regards to the meaning of the words. We are told to be slow to vow and quick to follow through on what we vow before and to God. We must take our promises seriously because God does. Jesus said, “Let your ‘yes’ mean ‘yes,’ and your ‘no’ mean ‘no.’ Anything more than this is from the evil one” (Matthew 5:37).\n\nJesus always listened to His Father, spoke truth from the heart, and followed through on His vows. Jesus atoned for the sins of our mouths, by keeping the promise He made to the Father that He would lay down His life for His sheep. When we return to God in brokenness over the many ways we have been slow to listen, quick to speak, and unfaithful to our vows, we find Him to be the source of forgiveness and cleansing, making a people from whose mouths wisdom proceeds.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I love Disney Pixar’s Toy Story movies. Over the years, those dolls have surprisingly taught me a lot about my own idolatry. Take Toy Story 2, when Sheriff Woody loses sight of his purpose in life. When he’s tempted by an opportunity to become “immortal” by joining an exhibition at a toy museum in Tokyo, Buzz Lightyear steps in to remind Woody of what’s true about him: “Somewhere in that pad of stuffing is a toy who taught me that life’s only worth living if you’re being loved by a kid.”\n\nBuzz knows Woody is meant for more than watching kids from a self-protective shield of glass. And in today’s reading, the Teacher sees the futility of worldly draws like power, wealth, and advancement. He has come to see that fame and fortune don’t last.\n\nThose who seek power often oppress the poor, making their lives so difficult, reasons the Teacher, that it would’ve been better to have never been born at all (Ecclesiastes 4:2–3). Those who seek wealth spend their time working for monetary achievement, but may lose their souls in the process (Luke 12:13–21). After all, what is money worth if there’s no one to share what it can buy with a friend, family, or community? (Ecclesiastes 4:8–10). Those who seek advancement attempt to leverage their influence to gain position and prestige (v.4). But no earthly king can stay in power forever; the people will grow tired of him, and he’ll eventually be replaced (vv.15–16).\n\nPower, wealth, and worldly advancement never keep their promises for satisfaction. A better life is found with true friends who aren’t jealously competing with one another for power, resources, and admiration. Instead, they see the way their gifts complement each other. C.S. Lewis once described it this way: “Sometimes [a friend] wonders what he’s doing there among his betters. He is lucky beyond desert to be in such company. Especially when the whole group is together, each bringing out all that is best, wisest, or funniest in all the others.”\n\nThe truth is that we all need friends like Buzz Lightyear—the kind who will call us out when our priorities are out of whack (Proverbs 27:17). We need friends who will help us see that the jealousy and discontent we feel are indicators of disordered desires. We need friends who will point beyond themselves to the truest of friends (John 15:13–15), and help us value Him more than the fleeting promises of this life.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    If you like children’s literature, you’ll know Lemony Snicket’s (Daniel Handler’s) A Series of Unfortunate Events. Handler’s series tells the story of the Baudelaire orphans: Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. In each book, these siblings encounter a dire situation, are rescued from it, and then have another even more dire, more unfortunate situation thrust upon them. Handler’s use of humor and historical allusions is entertaining, but his children’s books are strange because the sense of injustice and hopelessness never seems to let up.\n\nNowhere is this truer than in the fifth book when the three orphans visit Prufrock Preparatory School. Everything about Prufrock Prep reeks of death. The strict, yet wickedly unfair, vice-principal is a man named Nero (who plays the fiddle!). The school’s mascot is a dead horse. The campus was designed to look like a graveyard. And the school motto is Memento Mori, a Latin phrase that translates as, “Remember you will die.”\n\nPrufrock Prep reminds me of the middle section of Ecclesiastes 3. Here the Teacher sees injustice all around him, and he makes a statement that reads like hopeful faith… at first, declaring that God will judge all people, both the righteous and the wicked (Ecclesiastes 3:16–17). He then undermines any hope for justice he may have kindled: “People have no advantage over animals,” he observes; both end in the grave, so “everything is futile” (v.19). “Who knows,” the Teacher asks, “if the spirits of the children of Adam go upward and the spirits of animals go downward to the earth?” (v.21). From his merely human perspective, it’s impossible to know what happens after death. In the end, “all come from dust, and all return to dust” (v.20). In essence: Enjoy your life while you can, but don’t bother with hope.\n\nMany Christians wrestle with why such skeptical words would be included in the Bible. Like Lemony Snickett, the Teacher’s hopelessness doesn’t seem to let up. Still, considering the futility of death isn’t just for skeptics and cynics. The Latin expression, memento mori, which Handler appropriated for Prufrock Prep, was first used by early Christians. Believers know it’s important to soberly remember death, to number our days so we gain a heart of wisdom (Psalm 90:12). In one sense, the Teacher is right: Our time is short; we should make the most of every moment.\n\nYet we don’t do this without hope. When we remember the curse of death (Genesis 3:19,15), we must also remember His promises. God didn’t leave us in the dust; He sent us a Savior who looked death in the face and lives! Because of Jesus, God’s Spirit one day will speak into our graves and give us resurrection life (1Corinthians 15:35–58). One day, we’ll look back at our lives and see they were more than a series of meaningless happenings. One day, our Savior Judge will bring justice, and the last enemy He’ll defeat will be death itself (v.26).\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    In October of 1965, Peter Seeger’s “Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)” was recorded and released by the American folk-rock group, The Byrds. Less than two months later, the song rose to the Billboard Top 100 charts. If you’re not familiar, the song’s lyrics—except for the title refrain and the final line—are taken from the King James Version of Ecclesiastes 3:1–8. Since most associate the book of Ecclesiastes with King Solomon, who lived in the 10th century BC, The Byrds’ hit probably holds the distinction of being the number one song with the oldest lyrics.\n\nSeeger turned the Teacher’s poem into a plea for world peace. After quoting the second half of verse 8, “a time of war, and a time of peace,” he added, “I swear it’s not too late!” It’s not too late for peace; that line resonated with record-buying youth just as the Vietnam War was escalating. I think those young music lovers could see in the Bible’s poetry that there’s something beautiful about the turning of time. Clearly, they also wanted the war to end; they longed for a better time.\n\n“To every thing there is a season and a time \nfor every purpose under heaven” (Ecclesiastes 3:1, KJV).\n\nWhen the Teacher wrote these words, his goal was different from Peter Seeger’s. He wasn’t an ancient folk singer encouraging us to give peace a chance. But he did understand what it feels like to long for better times. The writer of Ecclesiastes saw that everything—birth and death, planting and uprooting, mourning and dancing—is beautifully appropriate in its season (v.11a). In God’s sovereignty over His creation, every one of these activities has its proper time. On the other hand, the Teacher knew that God has set eternity in the human heart (v.11b). God knows that we all long for more because He created us to long for Him.\n\nEveryone is hoping and dreaming about something bigger and better than what we see in our time. We want to see the big picture, the big story in which we live as players. We’re wondering, What’s the grand purpose behind it all? But we are limited. From a merely human point of view, the only answer is that it’s all meaningless, “a pursuit of the wind” (Ecclesiastes 2:11).\n\nThat’s why we must, in our broken times, fear the Lord. We must lift our eyes away from our broken circumstances and fix them upon Jesus. In this world, we will have trouble, but we can be of good cheer because our Savior has overcome the world; ultimate peace is found in Him (John 16:33). In Christ, God has prepared for us things that no eye has seen nor ear has heard (1 Corinthians 2:9–10). Though the story He’s writing is bigger than we can comprehend, we can grasp it by faith when we cling to the one who sees the end from the beginning, the one who holds time in His hands.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    There’s a certain musician whose work I’ve been following since I was in college. He slings an acoustic guitar and a harmonica, and his voice is an instrument all its own. His name is Jason Harrod. He’s not a big star. To most, he’s an unknown, a deep dive even to find on Spotify. But his songwriting is so good that those who do know him clutch his out-of-print CDs with a grip I imagine is only comparable to that of a new mother. In fact, early on, Jason and his one-time musical partner, Brian Funck, formed a duo that was routinely compared to Simon & Garfunkel. I’ve often wondered why his work isn’t better known—why he’s not winning Grammys or pulling down gold record-sales numbers.\n\nWhile I’ve long appreciated how Jason approaches his craft, in recent years something else about his music has been speaking to me. When you see Jason perform live, whether it’s in a theater, a coffee house, or someone’s living room, you can’t help but notice the joy that emanates from him. He clearly loves what he does. The life of an independent singer-songwriter is not for everyone. Being on the road for weeks at a time can’t be easy. Sharing a bit of your soul as you perform for strangers probably takes some getting used to. And I’m sure raising money for each new record and then selling them directly is no picnic either. The work is hard, but it’s clear from the light in his eyes and the smile on his face Jason Harrod genuinely loves it.\n\nI’m no musician, but I’m learning a lot about my own craft from Jason. As a writer, it often feels like my work is only as important and meaningful as the number of eyeballs that see it. There can be pressure from my own heart and from the industry to measure my work by the number of clicks, likes, or dollars generated. We all want to make an impact with the work we do, but maybe that’s not all there is to it. Jason seems to have discovered what Solomon so handily wrote: “There is nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work. I have seen that even this is from God’s hand” (Ecclesiastes 2:24).\n\nFinding joy in the work itself, rather than in the results, is a beautiful thing. It means we win whether our work impacts millions of people or is seen by God alone. It means we get to love what we do, no matter how many people notice. That sure does sound like a gift from heaven above and, incidentally, the sort of freedom that will go a long way to helping us produce our very best work. So whatever you do—whether you stand on stage, sit behind a desk, or walk alongside others—don’t wait to enjoy your job. If you do, you’ll be missing out.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

While releasing our youngest from his car seat and being distracted by my oldest’s parade of questions about Christmas, I didn’t see my middle child begin advancing his way down the parking lot. Cars were weaving in and out, and visibility was low due to the onset of twilight. Jude, for his part, strutted with the greatest of two-year-old confidence right down the middle of the lot without a care in the world.\n\nWhen I realized the Oreo creme in my kid cookie was missing, I stretched and scanned in every direction. In an instant, I spotted him, and with the force of a hurricane in my lungs, I shouted, “Jude! Freeze right there!” Thankfully, he stopped. Scooping my one-year-old under my arm and grabbing my five-year-old’s hand, I sprinted to Jude’s frozen spot. I hugged all three of my boys at once, tighter than usual.\n\nJude didn’t understand the danger of what could happen if a car had turned down the aisle, its driver distracted for a moment. Or what if he had gotten lost? Or worse? He was oblivious. Those thoughts never entered his mind. He was just happy to be out with Dad and his brothers.\n\nIgnorance is bliss, they say. That’s true whether you’re two or eighty-two. The more you know, the more you know this world is broken. “For with much wisdom is much sorrow; as knowledge increases, grief increases” (Ecclesiastes 1:18). Solomon discovered this for himself as he undertook the project that is recorded for us in the book of Ecclesiastes: “I applied my mind to examine and explore through wisdom all that is done under heaven” (v.13). What he discovered is grim. Everything was, as he put it, “a pursuit of the wind” (v.17).\n\nHuman knowledge and wisdom can only take us so far. In that, they are a dead end. Science and philosophy cannot deliver all the answers, because “no one can discover the work God has done from beginning to end” (Ecclesiastes 3:11). The task is simply too big, and our incomplete knowledge leaves us with a front-row, full-zoom view of all that has gone wrong in our universe, devoid of consolation. When I remember this, I am thankful that God did not simply leave us to our study; He spoke to us. He entered into our world. He inspired the Bible. He did all of this so that we might have hope beyond our despair, to give us a glimpse into the work He is doing.\n\nAfter sojourning for a while in this life, many of us want to return to the innocence of childhood, before the cracks in this world began to show—to be like my son Jude, strolling through a dangerous parking lot without a thought of concern or fear. But the hope we have in Christ is so much better. He doesn’t take us back to ignorance. Instead, He brings us to a place where there actually will be no fear, where the cracks will be gone, and where every broken thing will be made new (Revelation 21:5).\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I stood up tall, my feet planted at an awkward angle to accommodate the hill that made up the side of my yard. Wiping the sweat from my eyes, I looked down at the mound of uprooted weeds on my lawn with a sense of accomplishment. But that moment of yard work-induced pride was short-lived. Retreating from the hill of juniper to the grass below, I turned back to see that my four hours of labor had made almost no difference. The fuzzy rows of shrubs seemed just as inundated with crabgrass, dandelions, and pricker bushes as before. I had sacrificed my morning, not to mention my back and much of the skin on my fingers, for nothing.\n\nThis is the image that pops into my head when I think of the word meaningless. As I read Ecclesiastes, I imagine all of life is like that hillside of weed-infested juniper, undeterred by our best efforts, leaving us worn out and broken, stretched and bruised and without hope. “‘Absolute futility,’ says the Teacher. ‘Absolute futility. Everything is futile’” (Ecclesiastes 1:2). It’s no wonder Bible scholar N.T. Wright has dubbed the book of Ecclesiastes “the Eeyore of the Old Testament.” Its message is a difficult one to hear.\n\nEcclesiastes is no less inspired by the Spirit of God than is the Gospel of John or the book of Exodus, just as “profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness” (2Timothy 3:16). It is for our benefit, then, that we join the Teacher, most likely King Solomon, on his melancholy journey to explore life “under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:3). In fact, those three words—under the sun—may just be the key to unlocking the message of Ecclesiastes.\n\nSolomon writes not of spiritual realities, but of earthly observations. He does not bring his father David’s hope of life in God’s presence to bear (Psalm 16:11), nor does he weigh his findings against the promise of the coming Messiah. Instead, like a good scientist whose time came too early, he records what he can discover with his natural senses “under the sun.” In that, Ecclesiastes is a friend. When we bump up against the harsh realities of life and the injustices that come with the brokenness of this world, we remember that Solomon has been there before us. We know we are not alone. In fact, in the darkness of a book like Ecclesiastes, if we adjust our gaze, the light of the gospel will appear to shine all the brighter.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

Seriously though, for such a quick mention in the Bible, Diotrephes sure racks up a pretty hefty rap sheet. Paraphrasing here, Diotrephes likes to put himself first, he does not acknowledge authority, he talks wicked nonsense, he refuses to welcome the brothers, and he kicks to the curb whomever he pleases during church.\n\nJohn really didn’t mince words when it came to those opposing the work of the gospel. On the other hand, we can be thankful that John made it abundantly clear what he expected from believers concerning their life of faith: “Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good” (3John 11). Pretty straightforward. “You’ll recognize them by their fruit” (Matthew 7:16).\n\nNow, not to worry, John had a robust theology and doctrine of grace. A quick reading of the rest of his writings will confirm this in a heartbeat. But when given an opportunity for teaching and exhortation, he drives the necessity of sanctification and growth home with a thrust.\n\nThere is something comforting and complex about the nature of grace, and John was not shy to explore that cosmic reality. Lest his readers forget, this is the very same man who penned John 3:16. Here, however, as he encourages believers in the process of discipleship, John comes across more like a coach in a holy huddle, trying to pump up his players before they disperse to the activities and challenges of daily life.\n\nThe grace and love of God are abundant, lavish, and overflowing, but sometimes we need a little nudge to remember that the rubber’s gotta meet the road at some point. Our lives need to align with what our mouths profess. We’ve all heard the challenge, “Put your money where your mouth is.” Well, this is John’s imperative: “Put your life where your mouth is.”\n\nIt’s fitting that one of our other readings today comes from the book of Hebrews, whose author warns his readers more than a few times to be vigilant that they not fall away from their faith. You see, the writers of Hebrews and John both knew something that we need to remember: There is no “neutral” in the life of faith. You are either moving closer to the center of God’s design for your life, or you are drifting aimlessly toward the powers and ways of this world.\n\nThird John’s message is simple and clear: don’t name your kid Diotrephes, and more importantly, imitate good. It’s that clear and it’s that simple. The life of faith calls us all to imitate Christ, the only one who is good.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

Christian and Hopeful are traveling The Way that leads to the Celestial City. The path is soft and conveniently located next to the River of Life, until a bend in The Way leads them onto rough terrain that’s hard on their feet. After miles of hard going, the wearied and discouraged pilgrims spy a softer path: Bypath Meadow. It’s a path that runs close to The Way, and they assume it will merge with The Way at some place down the road, probably when the going gets easier. Ah, wishful thinking.\n\nIt doesn’t take long before Christian and Hopeful discover that Bypath Meadow is more like a trap than a path. After a series of difficulties including storms, floods, and worst of all, capture and torture at the hands of Giant Despair, Christian and Hopeful narrowly escape from the dungeon of Doubting Castle. They learned the hard way this truth from Proverbs 14:12: “There is a way that seems right to a person, but it’s end is the way to death.”\n\nIn 2 John, the apostle rejoices that some are still “walking” according to the truth. But that note of encouragement is dampened by the reality that a number of former disciples have fallen away. The sirens of the antichrist (2John 7) have wooed them into running ahead down Bypath Meadow, and they have completely lost sight of The Way (2John 9; John 14:6).\n\nAt this point, we might half expect John to command this fledgling church to immediately start a rigorous Bible reading program or establish a theological training institute. Clearly these people don’t know the truth, and greater knowledge of Scripture can be a course corrective for those veering onto a dangerous path (2Timothy 3:16). Right?\n\nBut that’s not what John says. Maybe we’d expect John to build the walls of the church a little higher. Add a bunch of new rules about who gets in, launch a new accountability plan, and put new policies in place. But that’s not what John says either.\n\nWhat does John say then? One thing: love one another (2John 5–6). No amped up Bible instruction or added rules. Just “love one another.” This may sound strange at first, but John is seeing to the source of many of our bypath blunders. He sees that down deep our waywardness is very often a result of a spiritual restlessness that arises when our communal bonds of love are weak or lost altogether. When we do not have a loving, “stick-together” community watching out for us, we drift onto bypasses that wind up leading to dead ends and disasters.\n\nThe gate is narrow and the path is difficult that leads to life (Matthew 7:13). Don’t go at it alone. Find a Hopeful to walk with you. You’ll need him. And he’ll need you.\n\nWritten by Nate Shurden\n\n                ",

The rest of the original twelve disciples—that blessed-beyond-measure, ragtag and motley crew of misfits who followed Jesus around wherever He went during His earthly ministry—had all died. Near as we can tell, they were each martyred in particularly cruel ways. But not John. He lived to a ripe old age. His life wasn’t without struggle, of course. He was exiled to Patmos for a time, but it is believed that he was eventually released and that he finished out his years in Ephesus.\n\nI wonder if John ever felt the weight of his position, being the last of the apostles. He was the final link to the earthly life of Jesus, the last one to report what he had heard with his own ears and seen with his own eyes. Reading the letters of John with this in mind, what stands out to me are the connections to things Jesus said in the Gospel of John.\n\nI can picture John, sitting there with his stylus in hand, thinking through the things he heard Jesus say, things that would be a tremendous encouragement to Christians in uncertain times. In my mind’s eye, I see the old apostle’s face light up when he remembers these words from his Savior: “If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it” (John 14:14). At the end of 1 John, we read, “This is the confidence we have before him: If we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears whatever we ask, we know that we have what we have asked of him” (1John 5:14–15). This promise is not speculation or a logical deduction based on a careful reading of the Old Testament. It is certain. John heard it from Jesus with his own ears.\n\nThough we are separated from the original recipients of John’s first letter by nearly two thousand years, we need this same promise. We need to know that when we pray, our hearts and minds aligned with God’s, He hears us and will answer us. This does not mean that we will have whatever we want, even those things that seem to match up with God’s desires as revealed in Scripture. It does mean, however, that as we pray in Jesus’s name (i.e., according to His character and will), we can be confident that He is actively working to bring about a world that reflects His goodness, beauty, and truth.\n\nJohn caught a glimpse of this world himself and wrote about it in the final chapters of the book of Revelation: “Then the one seated on the throne said, ‘Look, I am making everything new’” (Revelation 21:5). We may not always see the ways that our prayers are being answered, but one day we will see and experience the “good, pleasing, and perfect will of God” in all its splendor (Romans 12:2). And that is a reason to pray with confidence.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

Just a few months later, the doctors were confident that my eyes would not improve over time. There was no procedure or surgery available to correct the issues, so they told my parents I would eventually be blind.\n\nMy dad was, and still is, a pretty stubborn guy. But in this case, it turned out to be an amazing blessing. He was determined to find a doctor who would give him a different answer. And so, he marched into his boss’s office one morning and announced that he would be leaving every Friday at noon for the foreseeable future. He would use those afternoons to meet with ophthalmologists and eye surgeons, anyone who might give his son a better prognosis. A short time later, my dad did indeed find a doctor who was willing to operate. It was an experimental procedure with no guarantees, frontier medicine at the time. But the surgery was successful, and today I don’t even wear glasses.\n\nAt the time, my dad worked for IBM in lower Manhattan. It was, by every measure, a really great job—great medical and dental coverage, full pension, lots of time off. It was a wonderful opportunity with a growing company. It wasn’t the sort of job anyone would just toss aside lightly. But that’s what my dad was willing to do if it came to it. When he met with his boss to tell him his Friday afternoon plans, he wasn’t exactly seeking permission or requesting time off. He was simply saying, “If you care about me, respect me, and appreciate the work I do, then you will also care about my son. He’s my priority. This is not up for negotiation.” In other words, they couldn’t have the father without also loving his children.\n\nThis is also God’s posture toward His children—you, me, and the millions of brothers and sisters we have in Christ. That’s why John writes, “The one who loves God must also love his brother and sister” (1John 4:21). You can’t have the Father without also loving His children.\n\nThis can be hard for us. Like many kids in large families, we can forget that Dad has other kids He loves with His whole heart. He loves each of us uniquely and perfectly, but He doesn’t love us alone. So, then, how we treat our brothers and sisters is a good measure of how well we are loving God. Let’s love each other well, not because we are always loveable, but because God loves every one of His children. And we ought to love what He loves.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

It is the stuff of storybooks and Hollywood. Love overcomes fear and logic. It enables us to do amazing, sometimes idiotic, things. It is incredibly powerful—whether the love of a woman, a parent’s love for a child, or a best friend’s loyal love.\n\nThere is a love that supersedes all that, though: the love that marks us as followers of Jesus. It is perfect love because it is God’s love, the love that moved Him to give up His Son to make us His own children. It is the love that sent the Holy Spirit to be our guide. It is the love that gives us the assurance of our place as His children and our freedom from His judgment. As children of God, our acts of love are because of His Perfect love. We love because we are loved, marked as God’s family by two things: professing Jesus as Lord of our lives, and this perfect love from God, who is love (1John 4:16).\n\nIf our love for a spouse, a child, or a friend can overcome our fears, what can this perfect love from God do? It drives out fear (v.18). It doesn’t mask fear or the consequences for our actions, and it doesn’t make us fools by stealing our left-brain logic. As mortal, sinful people we will still be afraid, but that doesn’t mean we’ve lost sight of God’s love for us in Christ. It doesn’t mean we’ve lost touch with the Spirit, who works to comfort us and assure us of our place in God’s family. If we are in Christ, we have the unfailing love of God, and we need not be shaped or defined by our fears ever again.\n\nImagine a life not marked by insecurity or worrying about what other people will think of us. Imagine stepping up and actually doing those things we feel led to do, knowing that the love we have from God is too great to keep to ourselves. But we don’t have to imagine! We are children of God, and because of His great love for us, we don’t have to fear trials or persecution. We live in the shelter of God’s love and are defined by it.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

Sure, everyone can have “community,” but not everyone is quite literally brought into one Body, with God Himself as the head (Colossians 1:18). When my family and I moved halfway across the country last year, our new church community made us feel loved. We felt welcomed in, not isolated.\n\nMy neighbor, Neil, is recently a widower. His wife of several decades lost her battle with cancer just after we moved in, and he was left all alone. For the first several months of living next to him, we rarely spoke. I’d give him the occasional “Hey, neighbor!” wave when we were both in our driveways, but not much more. Neil was alone, and I barely even cared. Worse, he didn’t know Jesus—and I knew it.\n\nHere’s the tragic part: I was willing to drive fifteen minutes to our community group every week, but I wasn’t willing to pick up the phone to connect with Neil. I cherished the love and comfort from our church when we were alone in a new city, but I didn’t extend that comfort to Neil when he was mourning his closest companion. Aside from a half-hearted invitation to someday eat dinner with our family, I didn’t connect with him. I let him feel isolated.\n\nIn 1 John, the word “brothers” refers to other Christians. So when John says, “If anyone has this world’s goods and sees a fellow believer in need but withholds compassion from him—how does God’s love reside in him?”, he is talking about loving our Christian brothers and sisters (1John 3:17). When we moved to town, we felt this immediately. We even shared that love by serving others in our community group.\n\nThe Holy Spirit lives inside of us, according to verse 24, so that our love for one another can continue to thrive. God’s love is perfect, and God’s love is inside of us, which means we’re set up for success. And “when the Spirit of truth comes, He will guide [us] into all the truth” (John 16:13). That’s a pretty good arrangement.\n\nBut unlike me, God doesn’t separate Christian community and Christian mission. We don’t merely have the Spirit inside of us to help us love each other; we also have Him in order to love others. The unloved and isolated. My community group and my neighbor Neil.\n\nIf we love Christ, the world will hate us (John 15:19). They won’t understand us quite like our brothers and sisters in Christ. This is understandable. But that doesn’t negate the Great Commission to “go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations” (Matthew 28:19). This doesn’t start in Zambia or South Korea for me; it starts to the right and left of my house.\n\nWe should love other Christians, showing the world God’s love through our love for one another (John 13:35). In many ways, that’s the easy part, but we should not stop there. The Spirit also empowers us to remember those who are not yet brothers and sisters. Christ came to seek and save the lost, so we, too, must follow Him to pursue others.\n\nWritten by Brandon Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    My daughters bear a striking resemblance to me and an even more striking resemblance to each other. They are three years apart in age, and the younger one looks exactly like the older one did at the same age. When I show up at their school, their teachers say things like, “Yep, they’re yours alright.” The family resemblance is strong.\n\nFamily resemblance isn’t just genetic, though. It’s spiritual too. In 1 John 3 we are told that we are children of God, born of Him. As a mark of God’s great love, we are His children. Jesus explained this to Nicodemus as being “born again” (John 3:3). This phrase is one that has almost been clichéd out of any meaning, but think about it: born again. Nicodemus was a religious teacher and he was utterly baffled by this imagery. We should be too. How can a person be born, grow up, then be born again? By the Holy Spirit, Jesus says. That’s how. Our new life as children of God is a miracle of the Holy Spirit; we are remade as people.\n\nIn being made new—in being born again as God’s children—we take on a family resemblance to Christ, God’s Son. If we are His children, we are no longer marked by sin. We don’t look like sin; we look like Christ. This doesn’t mean that we never sin. It means that the defining characteristics of our life—the things that stand out, what people remember us by, and the shape of our personhood—are holy and Christlike. If someone met Jesus, they would look at us and say, “Yep, you’re His.”\n\nPractically, what this looks like is to be “doers of the Word” (James 1:22). We know what it means to follow Jesus because He told us. We know what it means to pursue holiness because He told us. It’s all in the Bible. And as children of God, we go from just being hearers and knowing something about it, to living by it. It’s the family story and the family expectations.\n\nBeing a child of God means being transformed. That is what “born again” means. It’s more than a profession of faith; it’s a new life in the Spirit. And it’s a life that resembles Jesus as we live out His Word daily. Yes, we will sin. But when we do, we know that we are still family and that Christ has made a way for us to be forgiven and accepted as children of God.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

Some 128 songs with the word “love” in the title have topped the US charts since 1943—from Elvis Presley’s “Love Me Tender” to the Beatles’ “All You Need is Love” to Rihanna’s “We Found Love.” And yet, for all of our obsession with love, no concept is as undefined and misunderstood.\n\nA friend of mine recently summed up the essence of this problem when he said, “Love is the most abused word in our culture.” Despite our unwillingness or lack of ability to define love, Scripture gives shape and form to this all-important element of the Christian’s life.\n\nAs the “Apostle of Love,” John mentions love twenty-six times in 1 John. When he comes to explain the nature of love in action, he does so by first telling us what we are not to love. He writes, “Do not love the world or the things in the world” (1John 2:15). We are not to set our hearts and affections on the things of a world that is under the sway of the evil one. John goes to great lengths to define what these things are, to avoid any misunderstanding. The love of the world is found in “the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride in one’s possessions” (v.16).\n\nThese are the same three patterns of temptation that we find in the opening chapters of the Bible. In Genesis 3, we are told, “The woman saw that the tree was good for food” (i.e., the lust of the flesh) and “delightful to look at” (i.e., the lust of the eyes), and that “it was desirable for obtaining wisdom” (i.e., the pride of life). “So she took some of its fruit and ate it; she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it” (Genesis 3:6). Satan tempts God’s people to seek to please the self rather than to love the Lord.\n\nJust as Satan tempted Eve in the Garden, so he tempted Jesus in the wilderness:\n\nThe lust of the flesh: Then the tempter approached him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread” (Matthew 4:3).\n\nThe lust of the eyes: The devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor (v.8).\n\nThe pride of life: “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down,” that the angels would rescue Him (v.6).\n\nThe manner by which he tempts us today is still the same. The particular temptations may differ, but the way they work upon the mind and heart of man are the same. The evil one tempts us to love the things of this world by getting us to take our eyes off of Jesus and the purposes of God that are fulfilled in Him.\n\nJohn closes his explanation of love in action by telling us what we are to love: “The one who does the will of God remains forever” (1John 2:17). Jesus overcame the temptation to love the world and the things in it, remaining steadfast in His commitment to His Father’s will, all for the sake of redeeming the lost. Jesus abided in the love of His Father by obedience so that we might now “remain in him,” abiding in the love of the Father by faith in Him (v.27).\n\nHe who abides in the doctrine of Christ—against all the false teaching that detracts from the gospel—abides in the love of God, and ultimately overcomes the world. This is love in action.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

The guy loved light, so much so that the Gospel that bears his name practically glows in the dark:\n\nIn him was life, and that life was the light of men. That light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome it (John 1:4–5).\n\nThe true light that gives light to everyone, was coming into the world (John 1:9).\n\n“But anyone who lives by the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be shown to be accomplished by God” (John 3:21).\n\nJesus spoke to them again: “I am the light of the world. Anyone who follows me will never walk in the darkness but will have the light of life” (John 8:12).\n\nAnd here in 1 John, the fisherman-turned-apostle is still lighting up the night. He writes, “The darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining” (1John 2:8). John does have a flare for symbols and figurative language, but the reality he’s describing is more than poetic.\n\nIf you think back to Genesis, you may remember that the first thing “God said” [was] ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light” (Genesis 1:3). Prior to that, the earth was “formless and empty” and “darkness covered the surface of the watery depths” (v.2). To put it mildly, there was chaos and disorder. The world was not suited for life. Then God spoke light into being, and a new age dawned. As God brought form to creation and filled what was empty, He saw that the world He had created was good, again and again (Genesis 1:4,10,12,18,21,25,31).\n\nWhen sin entered the world, it brought with it its own brand of formlessness and emptiness. John sees in Jesus a new light dawning. Just as it was at creation, the light is bringing with it a new age, an age in which all things are being made new—every bit as “good” as we can imagine. But the old age, the darkness, is still here. God is too gracious to simply destroy the darkness and those trapped by it. Instead, the gospel invites “people walking in darkness” to enter into the light (Isaiah 9:2).\n\nFirst John is a reminder to all who profess to know Christ: Look around! Don’t fool yourself! Make sure you’re walking in the light. “But whoever keeps his word, truly in him the love of God is made complete… The one who says he is in the light but hates his brother or sister is in the darkness until now” (1John 2:5,9). The light shines brightly. It’s hard to miss if we’re following Jesus.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Apparently, John likes to begin at the beginning. In his Gospel, he declares, “In the beginning was the Word” (John 1:1). In 1 John, he writes, “What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have observed and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life… we are writing these things” to share them with you (1John 1:1,4). He continually beckons us to remember the light of that first creation. In the beginning, “God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light” (Genesis 1:3).\n\nThe sharp divide of light from darkness, of right from wrong, of holiness from wickedness, of truth from falsehood, makes us uncomfortable. We live in a world that is very comfortable with gray. We are more comfortable with gray because, in the muddied middle grounds, we can more easily dodge the issue of sin. We may prefer not to make the bold statement, “I have no sin,” but it’s easy enough to say, “It’s a gray area, neither right nor wrong.” Like Adam and Eve, we hide in the bushes, point the finger of distraction, make excuses, and blame our circumstances or someone else altogether. We’d rather not deal with Christ’s light and our darkness.\n\nSo John begins: “This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light, and there is absolutely no darkness in him. If we say, ‘We have fellowship with him,’ and yet we walk in darkness, we are lying and are not practicing the truth” (1John 1:5–6).\n\nIn Christ, there is no darkness at all. None. “The LORD is slow to anger and abounding in faithful love, forgiving iniquity and rebellion. But he will not leave the guilty unpunished” (Numbers 14:18). This is an unsettling truth for a people most comfortable with gray. The gospel is uncomfortable because it exposes the truth, a truth that we are reluctant to face. Do we hide in the darkness, or do we love the light?\n\nApart from the grace of God, I would remain hiding in the corner, making excuses, and avoiding the truth. But John calls us to enter the light not in fear, but with great joy. Yes, we, like Adam, have sinned grievously. But if we lay our darkness at His feet, we will be made clean. “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1John 1:9).\n\nJust as, in the beginning, God spoke into darkness and declared, “Let there be light!”, so also His voice pierces our darkness. In this our joy is made complete, for “that light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome it” (John 1:5). Brothers, if we walk in the light, we have fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

Around 1:00 AM, I awoke in a panic, my heart pounding. I am afraid. “It is good to wait quietly for salvation from the LORD” (Lamentations 3:26), but in times of deep trouble, in seasons of fear and stress, it is not easy to wait quietly. It takes a supernatural strength.\n\nOver the last few years, my family has been rattled and strained, pushed to the very verge of breaking. I could bear it with greater ease if it were an enemy from the outside threatening us, but it is not. We are shaken from the inside. At 3:00 AM, the world is either the dark valley of the shadow, or it is a hopeful quiet as dawn approaches. Sometimes it is both.\n\nNine years ago, we decided to adopt two boys. I knew it would bring many challenges, but I also expected it would be a path of continual improvement, and that at the end of a short season of toil and trauma and struggle, our family would find its rhythm, and we would be normal. Although I “hold fast to the confession” of our hope (Hebrews 4:14), my rosy dream has since been shattered again and again. The impact of trauma, the waywardness of a son I love, and my own sins continually sow the seeds of upheaval.\n\nPsalm 133 says, “How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in harmony!” (v.1). But what happens when they do not? What happens when sin produces not only disruption, but bone-deep heartache, distress, and even fear?\n\nI have been blessed to be surrounded by many dear friends who are willing to weep with me and pray with me, rather than try to fix everything and answer every question. In both solitude and in community, it is tempting to think that the proper response to sorrow is to put in our two cents, as if those who grieve need us. Pride and ambition can disguise themselves as false shepherds.\n\nBut they are hired hands, serving their own ends rather than those of the flock. There is only one true Shepherd. There is only one Comforter. He beckons us to “come away by yourselves to a remote place and rest for a while… Come to Me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Mark 6:31, Matthew 11:28). In the turmoil of circumstances, He is the quiet. He is even our joy.\n\nI would like to have endless hours of solitude to sort through everything on my own. But morning comes, and the household awakes; many people are coming and going. Each day offers its fair share of troubles, and it is hard to know if I’m facing them well. If I see someone I love walking in rebellion, can I do anything but grieve? Grieving and praying are both much easier in those times of quiet and solitude. But I need to gather with others as well; though it is difficult to open up and bring the painful truths to light with others, it is good.\n\nI don’t have answers. All too often, I’m not sure of what I long for more: fellowship or seclusion. I believe I am called to simply lean in to the sorrow, and wait for Him. But I know this: two are better than one (Ecclesiastes 4:9; Matthew 18:20), and I often need that extra hand to lift me up when I am stumbling. Whether in community or in solitude, the Comforter comes.\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

Like the chorus of a pop song, they were repeated at regular intervals, whenever my older sister received something I didn’t or my request for a stay of bedtime was denied.\n\nOf course, these “injustices” were really not so in hindsight—and were inconsequential at best. But the world around us is full of true heartache, real pain and suffering, unimaginable wickedness poured out from one broken soul to another. Still, somewhere in the recesses of my mind, that rhetorical question from childhood echoes: Who told you life was fair?\n\nThe truth is, no one needs to tell us that life is unfair. We know it. We witness it. We experience it. We can’t escape it. But maybe what we really know, deep down inside, is not simply that injustice exists, but rather that it shouldn’t—that the Creator of this world made everything good, and that He is righteous and fair, compassionate and kind. This world is out of order. The grating sensation we feel when we come face-to-face with injustice rises up within us because we know it does not belong.\n\nLife isn’t fair, but it should be. Justice was in the soil and air of Eden, part of the DNA of paradise. When sin twisted the goodness of creation, it also spread the disease of injustice across the universe. But thanks be to God that the story will end as it began, with a restoration of “liberty and justice for all,” to borrow an aspiration from American lore that will only be fully realized when Jesus returns as King.\n\nThe gospel—the “good news”—is not that God has provided a path of escape from this world, to bring us to heaven where justice reigns. Instead, it is that He is bringing heaven, with its perfect justice and righteousness, to earth. Until then, we have been left as emissaries of the Lord and His coming kingdom. Our marching orders? “Learn to do what is good. Pursue justice. Correct the oppressor. Defend the rights of the fatherless. Plead the widow’s cause” (Isaiah 1:17). In this way, we proclaim the coming destruction of injustice and evil, the collapse of power gained through the exploitation of the powerless, and the death knell of cyclical poverty and systemic racism.\n\nNo, life isn’t fair, but one day it will be.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

I felt like a man working on an assembly line, one where every widget on the conveyor belt was broken and needed to be fixed. And none were the same! Every widget consisted of some different variety of pieces. And the belt kept bringing them on and on, endlessly, until I clocked out. I was not dreaming; this was my day. I have a lot of days like this, and honestly, I am not sure if it will ever end. Some nights I lie in dread at the coming of the next day.\n\n“For what does a man get with all his work and all his efforts that he labors at under the sun? For all his days are filled with grief, and his occupation is sorrowful; even at night, his mind does not rest. This too is futile” (Ecclesiastes 2:22–23).\n\nBelieve it or not, one of the things that has helped me most over the past 5 years of working in the business world—a world for which I was never trained—has been acknowledging how frustrating it really is. I kept thinking, “This is not the way it’s supposed to be.” And it took me a while to realize, that’s a holy thought. The Bible is clear. When God tells Adam that the ground is cursed and his work will now be hard (Genesis 3:17), it reminds me that work is not bad, but it will never be what it was supposed to be until Jesus returns.\n\nWhen I realize that nothing—not even this frustrating job—can separate me from the love of God because of the work of Jesus (Romans 8:38–39), the Holy Spirit moves and I see glimpses of the glory of God and His redeeming work in and through my work. I get to be kind to others in a sometimes cold environment. I get to enjoy other people’s kindness, and even smile at the brilliance of the people I work with. There are times I know that, in my work, I am pushing back against the fall itself.\n\nToday was awful. But it’s not supposed to be. And when I sit at my desk and groan at the day before me, I know that I am groaning, as Paul said, with all of creation, eagerly waiting for the redemption of our everything (Romans 8:22–23). Even our work.\n\nThat is a holy thought. A prayer, even.\n\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Not long ago, my doctor called to tell me to go to the emergency room. I had been battling a fever that wouldn’t break, and a blood test revealed a raging bacterial infection that was in the process of destroying my heart. I was dying.\n\nUp until that moment, I had never been in the hospital for anything. I’d never broken a bone, or had my appendix out, or anything like that. I was the picture of health. But when I pulled up to the ER and gave my name at the nurse’s station, a team of medical professionals was waiting for me. They took me to a room and began a process of diagnosis and treatment that would soon require open-heart surgery followed by months of recovery.\n\nI turned 40 during this season and, for the first time in my life, came face to face with my mortality. My body was destroying itself, and unless someone who knew my affliction and how to fix it intervened, I would have died. My heart valves would have failed and my lungs would have filled with blood, drowning me.\n\nThe onset of affliction brought me closer than I had ever come to the knowledge that we are all in the process of falling apart. We are the image-bearers of God living in bodies that are breaking down. We are given the glorious promise that every sorrow and sickness will one day end (Revelation 21:4), but that day has not yet come. What do we make of that?\n\nThe apostle Paul describes suffering in this life as “momentary light affliction” when compared to the “absolutely incomparable eternal weight of glory” that is ours when our faith is in Christ (2 Corinthians 4:17). But this doesn’t mean the momentary nature of our suffering, or its comparative lightness, is of no consequence to God.\n\nIn Mark 1, we read about a leper who called out to Jesus, “If you are willing, you can make me clean” (Mark 1:40). Mark tells us that Jesus was “moved with compassion” (v.41). The Messiah felt something in response to the suffering man’s affliction. He didn’t wave the leper off or speak a little blessing. He was moved with compassion. “I am willing.” Jesus told him. “Be made clean” (v.41).\n\nI love this about Jesus. God cares about our need for eternal healing (our greater need, by far), but He does not dismiss our present suffering in the process. Sometimes He heals us in the here and now. Sometimes He does not. And we cannot know why God does what He does in this regard. That information just isn’t given to us. But the fact that we’re promised that one day all our sufferings will cease tells us our afflictions matter to God right now.\n\nEven when God does not remove our afflictions from us, His eternal plan has them in view. When I was afflicted and uncertain about what the future held, this truth was profoundly comforting. We are the object of God’s compassion. This means we are free to put our faith in the One who has promised to deliver us from a world where hospitals are necessary. I look forward to that.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Weep with those who weep, and rejoice with those who rejoice (Romans 12:15). There is a lot of power in that word “with.” Most of us are familiar with these commands but, if we think of them at all, find them awfully uncomfortable. Weeping and rejoicing—those are vulnerable expressions. And vulnerability is personal and scary. Risky, even.\n\nWhen do you weep?\n\nWe weep at loss, at fear, at our complete lack of control or hope. We weep when our wife says she is leaving, or when our child is diagnosed with leukemia, or when our boss says he has to let us go. We don’t often weep publicly, of course. We weep when we are in the car or at home, alone. We weep when there is no more illusion of control, or of being able to fix the situation, or of even being able to put one foot in front of the other.\n\nNow, think of when you rejoice.\n\nWe rejoice at the utterly unexpected and when the thread of hope we’ve clung to turns out to be a lifeline, pulling us to safety. We rejoice when our wife returns, when the doctor says “the scans are clean,” when the tax return comes just in time to replenish the bank account.\n\nTimes of weeping and rejoicing are deep, poignant, and often our own. They are deeply personal, right? They are my expressions of pain or joy. You can keep yours over there, thanks.\n\nLet me pose a “what if” question, though. What if, as Hebrews says, we were “in the habit of meeting together” and being genuinely concerned for one another? (Hebrews 10:25). What if we were with each other in joy and sorrow?\n\nSuch meeting together has saved my soul, or very nearly so. A group of close friends were the ones who wept with me as I wrestled through faith and marriage and job crises over the years. They rejoiced with me at every grace God poured out, and sometimes they rejoiced for me when I was too blind do so. They didn’t treat my sorrows or joys as mine only. They were ours, and in being ours, burdens were divided and happiness was multiplied.\n\nWith means far more than “I’ll pray for you.” It means praying with you. It means far more than congratulating a friend. It means celebrating with them because you feel their joy. With means uniquely reflecting God’s image. God turns His face to the sorrowful and the hurting. He doesn’t ignore or abandon. He knows our suffering because Christ suffered all that we suffer. Christ promises rest for those who are weary of carrying unbearable weight (Galatians 6:2). You and I are called to be the hands and hearts and voices to share in this sort of care, this rest, this understanding by weeping and rejoicing with others. It is holy work.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

It is the way in which pain can be embraced, not out of a desire to suffer, but in the knowledge that something new will be born in the pain.” —Henri Nouwen\n\nFor far too long, I believed that seasons of deep sadness were incompatible with the Christian life. Somewhere along the way I had come to think that knowing God meant I should bear a perpetual smile, that to be a Christian was to always be exuberant and full of energy. “Christians should be the happiest of all people,” my pastor once said. On the one hand, I think he was right. We have much to celebrate and much to rejoice in; however, this does not mean we need to govern our lives by trite aphorisms or glib sayings.\n\nThe deep sadness, the bitter pain, the wrestling with despair does not mean that you are far from God. No, it means that God is with you in the depths. We serve an empathetic, caring God. He is not put off by your grief. He is not put off by your despair. He is certainly not put off by your brokenness.\n\nPerhaps one of the deepest losses I have ever felt was that of my grandfather’s passing. Our Southern, deeply connected family was led for as long as I could remember by this benevolent patriarch. He cared for each of his children and grandchildren dearly, and that was seen in every interaction. This could have been, in part, because he himself was an orphan. He knew the deep pain that is felt in the absence of a family or a tribe to call your own.\n\nOne of the things I still love most about my grandfather is the way he feigned gruffness or impatience. I say “feigned” because I don’t think he was truly trying to ruffle our feathers. Rather, this was his way of letting us know he was there and, in a roundabout way, he was there for us.\n\nHis memorial was marked by celebration in light of his homecoming and a life well-lived, but also by a thick and palpable grief. My 13-year-old self felt like the right thing to do was to try to cheer everyone up. An honest mistake, I think. I now realize it would’ve been better to sit in the loss and the grief of his passing, and allow others to do the same. Not sadness for sadness’ sake, but grief for our spirits’ sake.\n\nThe beautiful thing about the incarnation is that Jesus has experienced the fullness of the human condition. He has walked through the valley of the shadow of death (Psalm 23). This means that when we grieve, we encounter not only an encouraging God, but also a suffering One. We serve a God who not only observes our pain and sorrow, but who enters into our grief with us.\n\nIn the fullness of His kingdom, “He will destroy death forever” and “wipe away the tears from every face” (Isaiah 25:8). But in this present age, He walks through the darkness with us. God is not on the other side of our grief; we need not push through it to find Him. No, He is with us in our sorrow, our doubt, our loss, and our suffering. Remember. He is with us always.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

You see things differently at fifty-three than you did at twenty-two or thirty-seven. That’s simply the way life is. When you’re younger, death is the furthest thing from your mind, as it should be. But when you’re not so young anymore, life’s saddle starts shifting underneath you a little. Again, that’s simply the way life is. But it leaves you stretched between your mortality and the breathless gift of being alive on this good earth.\n\nSo how do you then live? I’ll share the best advice I’ve found on this (and I’ve about heard it all). It comes from Frederick Buechner: “Here is the world. Beautiful and terrible things will happen. Don’t be afraid.”\n\nI used to believe those words were just for the young. But now I see them as imperative as we age, because the temptation is to either pretend you’re still nineteen, or become some kind of Eeyore-type character, moping around and waiting for the bitter end to come already. Neither requires faith, much less courage.\n\nBeautiful things will happen, like watching my daughter graduate from high school and then set her sights high toward her future. Terrible things will happen, like a back injury that sidelined me for a year, unable to even do a pushup—an injury I sustained while acting as if I were nineteen.\n\nBeautiful things will happen, like officiating as my parents renewed their vows in a golden wedding anniversary ceremony. Terrible things will happen, like the death of an old classmate taken far too soon, a lady I had a crush on when she was just a girl and I was just a boy. Hearing of her death gutted me with strange heartache.\n\nBeautiful things will happen, like receiving a letter in the mail from a couple I helped years ago with a little premarital counseling, with a message that read, “Your words meant so much to us that we named our son after you. Just wanted you to know!” Terrible things will happen, like losing the joy of my salvation for a season, not knowing why or what to do about it. Beautiful things will happen, like being slowly wooed again by the Savior who has loved me longer than anyone else.\n\nA man’s days are like grass; he blooms like a flower in a field, and then fades with the wind (Psalm 103:15–16). But one day, death will no longer exist; neither will grief, crying, and pain because the old order of things will pass away (Revelation 21:4). This is the deal. This is God’s world. The beautiful and the terrible. This is abundant life.\n\nDon’t be afraid.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

It wasn’t the county property tax statement—we had already paid that one. Nor was it the local school taxes, or an excise tax, or an income tax. This was another level of taxation entirely, one that I forget about every year until that blasted bill comes in the mail.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. It’s not that I don’t think I should be taxed. I understand that tax revenue is necessary for our concentric levels of government to provide basic goods and services, like roads and schools and IRS auditors. My beef with this particular tax, and property taxes in general, is that they never end. No matter how long my wife and I live in our home, the bills will keep coming. Long after the final mortgage payment has been made, we’ll be paying property taxes. Year after year after year. Even when we’re dead and buried, and our sons inherit what we’ve left behind, the bills will not relent. They’ll come just the same.\n\nIt sort of makes home ownership a myth, right? As long as property taxes exist, no one will ever really own their home, because if you stop paying those taxes, the government will eventually put a lien on your house. Then they’ll take it to sell it at auction and settle your tax bill. You can be thrown out into the street, even though you’ve paid for the property in full.\n\nI bring this up because it strikes me that a lot of people view their sin this way. As if Jesus paid for our sins on the cross, but that was once, a long time ago, and the bills are still coming, requiring payment from us in the form of good works or religious behavior. But, as pervasive as our sin is, the redemption Christ purchased for us is more so. God’s grace is bigger and broader than our worst offenses.\n\nThe apostle Paul wrote, “Who can bring an accusation against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies. Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died, but even more, has been raised; he also is at the right hand of God and intercedes for us. Who can separate us from the love of Christ? Can affliction or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?” (Romans 8:33–35). The answer is no to all of the above. No one and nothing can separate us from the love of God, because our sin has been paid for in full.\n\nThe author of Hebrews was even clearer on the subject. He wrote that the sacrificial system of ancient Israel had been “a reminder of sins year after year” (Hebrews 10:3), like a tax bill that’s never satisfied. But the sacrifice of Christ, on the other hand, is “once for all…. For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified” (vv.10,14).\n\nThe bill has been paid, once and forever. Salvation is ours in Christ, free and clear. But the best part—our home is with Him, now and forever. Amen.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Can you bear to look?\n\nIt seems that even Matthew could not endure the sight: “After crucifying Him they divided His clothes by casting lots,” he wrote (Matthew 27:35). We can look at His empty robes at the foot of the cross, but how can our eyes stand to see His bloody and broken body?\n\nThe weight of the crucifixion of Christ is difficult to comprehend. I find that I get lost in my efforts to understand it more fully, straying into sentimental imagination of Christ’s very human agony or into detached pondering of its theological significance. Witnessing Christ’s death must have been unimaginably brutal. Of course, from our perspective a couple of millenia later, we know it was also incomprehensibly profound and deeply personal. My own sin put him there. My voice mocked His suffering. My hands gambled for His clothing. My criminal lips taunted and spat at Him.\n\nWhat are we to do with this?\nHow do we approach the God we mocked?\nHow do we look upon the Christ we crucified?\n\nThere are no words. We can make no answer, no appeal. Scripture tells us that as Jesus approached Jerusalem on the day of His triumphal entry, “he wept for it, saying, “If you knew this day what would bring peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes” (Luke 19:41–42). “He was pierced because of our rebellion, crushed because of our iniquities; punishment for our peace was on him, and we are healed by his wounds” (Isaiah 53:5). Jesus was willingly scarred by our sin, and yet stands before us to say, “Peace to you!” (Luke 24:36).\n\nDo you tremble at this?\n\nJesus is the very image of the invisible God, the Creator of all of heaven and earth, the head of the Church, the ruler of all dominions, who was before all things, and in whom the fullness of deity dwells. And God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in Jesus in order to reconcile us to Himself, to make our relationship with Him right (Colossians 1:15–20). Knowing all this about Jesus, our Savior, how can we not tremble?\n\nWhen Jesus asks, “Why are you troubled?”, the whole world of awful betrayal, of faithless doubt, seems to disappear. When He says, “Why do doubts arise in your hearts?”, a great barrier shatters. The trembling, awe, and even disbelief we sometimes feel before our Jesus, our crucified God returned from the dead— are now reasons to rejoice.\n\nThe apostle Paul writes, “I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me” (Galatians 2:20). At the cross, we witness not only Christ’s death, but our death. At the empty tomb we witness not only His life, but ours.\n\nThe Messiah has suffered and died and risen, so that forgiveness of sin might be proclaimed to all nations. Oh that our eyes might be ever fixed on Christ, crucified and risen! How can we bear to look away?\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    God created us as complex creatures, capable of feeling and sensing a whole garden of emotions. Made in the image of our Creator, we can both grieve the wrongs of this world, and celebrate the sweetness of this life. This 2-week reading plan will lead us through a series of passages from Scripture that examine the seasons of mourning and dancing in the life of a believer. In the written responses here on the site, our writers will enter into this tension, articulating their personal experiences with grief and joy in hopes of freeing you to explore your own. By immersing our hearts and minds in God’s Word, and honestly presenting our laments to Him, may we remember that God is present with us, He is good, and He is faithful.\n\nThere is a time for everything. There is a time to mourn and a time to dance. Occasionally, the seasons of these seeming opposites come at the same time.\n\nI have a friend who died from cancer. He was one day older than me. I miss him a lot. He was a wonderful man who loved the Lord. When I met him, he was in the late stages of the cancer that took him. Multiple surgeries on his brain had left him partially paralyzed. He struggled to speak. But his love of life, Christ, and his wife, family, and friends made him someone whose memory encouraged me greatly when I later faced a life-threatening illness of my own.\n\nHis wife was also my friend. They lived a few houses down from us. When my friend died, I had the sad, holy honor of presiding over his funeral and walking with his family through their grief. I remember how, for what seemed like the next few months, my friend’s wife always had tears in her eyes. She wasn’t openly weeping continually, but her eyes were always hot with tears. I remember how they would just roll down her face, even as we talked about mundane things like mowing the lawn or an upcoming church picnic. Tears. Always tears.\n\nAt first, this made me nervous when I would talk to her. I didn’t want to trigger her sorrow. But after a while, she told me she wished her tears would cease so that people would stop avoiding the subject of her husband’s death when they were around her.\n\nShe said something I hope I never forget: “The tears are here because I’m sad and I miss my husband. My heart is broken. But I want to talk about him. I want to remember him with others who knew him and loved him. That brings me joy, even as it causes me to weep. I want people to understand that I can feel more than one thing at a time.”\n\nSuch wisdom. It is a mark of spiritual maturity to be able to feel more than one thing at a time. God has given us the capacity to simultaneously feel the depths of sorrow over the loss of a loved one and a swell of gratitude to God for the gift of that person’s life. This isn’t easy. In fact, it may even be something of a learned skill. But God has given us an incredible ability to feel things deeply in their time—even conflicting emotions at the same time.\n\nScripture has much to say about our deepest pains and brightest hopes, and as we read, we are invited to grow in our emotional, spiritual health. It’s okay to feel. In fact, it is vital.\n\nThere is a time to mourn and a time to dance (Ecclesiastes 3:4)—and those seasons may come joined to each other. Now may be the time for you to weep. Now may be the time for you to celebrate. Now may be the time for you to do both. Remember, we do not grieve as those who have no hope (1 Thessalonians 4:13). So lean in and welcome the scrutiny of Scripture as we lay our hearts bare before the Lord.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I was born cross-eyed with a severe astigmatism. When my eyes didn’t show any signs of improving on their own, the doctors told my mom and dad I would eventually go blind and they should be prepared to care for a child with a handicap. My dad’s faults include a strain of stubbornness almost as severe as my astigmatism, but at that moment it was his greatest strength. He refused to accept what the medical establishment considered likely, if not inevitable.\n\nThe next morning at work, he unapologetically told his boss that he would be leaving work early every Friday for the foreseeable future. He was on the hunt for a doctor who could give his son a different prognosis. After months of searching, he found one—an eye specialist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City who believed he could have me seeing the world (and not just the end of my own nose) with a new surgical procedure. So, at nine months old, I was sedated and wheeled into surgery. The operation was a success. Though I had to wear pretty thick glasses from then on and spent a good chunk of the next seven years rocking an eyepatch like a pirate, I could see.\n\nGrowing up, I thought I would have to wear glasses for the rest of my life, but my dad told me over and over again not to give up hope. “You were supposed to be blind, remember?” he’d say. And he was right. About three years ago, I went in for another surgery, and now I have nearly 20-20 vision. I don’t even own a pair of glasses anymore.\n\nIn the book of Revelation, it’s as if Jesus is standing up at the end of history, when all things have been made new and God once again dwells with His people, shouting back through time to encourage every believer not to give up hope. At any given moment in the present, things might seem bleak, but we were supposed to be dead in our sins, remember? “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end,” He says (Revelation 22:13).\n\nWe tend to think of Jesus in time and space, a Galileean carpenter with a band of disciples, beard on His face and sandals on His feet. There’s nothing wrong with this image of Jesus. He really did live in this world at an actual and definite point in history. We can still visit the places where He performed miracles, the sites where He preached, and the hill where He died for our sins. But that was the incarnation—the exception, the miracle in which God the Son stepped out of eternity to be born as a man. Here in Revelation, Jesus is “revealed” in His glory. As God, He knows the beginning and the end, so when He says things will turn out alright, we can trust Him. “I am the first and I am the last. There is no God but me. Who, like me, can announce the future?” (Isaiah 44:6–7). We just have to be stubborn enough to believe Him.\n\nBy John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Martyn Lloyd-Jones, pastor at Westminster Chapel in London from the 1930s to the 1960s, once contrasted two different approaches to the Christian life by comparing them to the differences between an adorned Christmas tree and a real, living tree. One view of the Christian life looks at what a Christian should be, and then says that a Christian should try to put those things in his life. In essence, his words might be summed up in this way:\n\nA Christian is loving, so he should strive to be more loving. \nA Christian is joyful, so he must work to have more joy. \nA Christian is generous, so he needs to try his hand at being more generous.\n\nLloyd-Jones uses this comparison to illustrate a healthy, thriving Christian life. Nothing on the Christmas tree actually grows there; it has artificial adornments, and someone hung them there. However, the fruit on the real tree grows because it is a reflection of what the tree is on the inside. How do you know you are staring at an apple tree? It grows apples. No one has to hang them there; they simply grow on a healthy tree.\n\nToday’s readings help us understand the second, more organic approach to the Christian life. Rather than trying to add virtues that we don’t have within us, the Christian dwells deeply in Christ and sees virtue grow in his life as a result of the Spirit’s work within him.\n\nSpeaking to His disciples the night before His death, Jesus wanted to reassure them that He would continually be at work in them, even after He was no longer physically with them. When He told them, “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener,” He was promising that He would be the source of their life, joy, and growth, and that the Father would work in their lives so that they would constantly be in the best position to grow into His likeness (John 15:1).\n\nMany Christians refer to the list of virtues in Galatians 5 as “the fruits of the Spirit,” but that isn’t what the text says. Read it again. It says, “but the fruit of the Spirit” (vv.22–23, emphasis mine). True Christian virtue—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control—rises from within and is the work of the Holy Spirit. This isn’t a list of areas of your life to work on. It’s a catalogue of what arises in your life when you are walking by the Spirit and not gratifying the desires of your flesh.\n\nJesus left His disciples, both those listening at the time and those who would believe because of their preaching, with the indispensable ingredient for spiritual growth. He told them, “Remain in me, and I in you” (John 15:4). Jesus wants us to dwell deeply in Him, to fellowship with Him, and to find our life in Him. He wants His Word to remain in our minds and our hearts, and for us to continually draw near to Him in prayer. As we abide in Him, He abides in us, and His life works itself deeply into ours. We will not have to hang virtues on our lives so that we will look like Christian men; those virtues will be there because Jesus is in us.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The cemetery in my hometown is located next to the high school. My grandparents’ house was on the other side of the cemetery, so I walked or drove by that cemetery almost every day of my life growing up and thought nothing of it. I recognized some of the last names on the graves, but I did not know any of the people who were buried there.\n\nI started teaching at my old high school last year, so now I drive by that same cemetery every day, but now that I’m in my forties, the headstones bear the names of people I knew. In the years since I was a child, death has become much more real to me. People that I can remember in the prime of their lives grew sick and weak, then died. We truly live our lives in the shadow of death.\n\nWhen we consider our lives in light of the reality of death, Jesus’s declaration that He is “the way, the truth, and the life” becomes extremely precious to us (John 14:6). The context for His words is important—it was the night before His death. As He prepared His disciples for His departure, Jesus spoke to them of both the trouble they would face and the hope that He held out for them.\n\nJesus told them that He would go to prepare a place for them and would return again to bring them back to Himself. The disciples did not understand His teaching and pressed Him for details. How could they know the way He was going? He answered by telling them not where He would be going, but how they would join Him, telling them, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (v.6).\n\nJesus’s words hold out a beautiful hope for us too. Because He died and rose from the dead, anyone who wants to know the Father can now come to Him through the Son. Jesus destroyed the hostility between us and the Father through His death, and was raised from the dead because death has now been conquered. Our greatest enemies, sin and death, have experienced their ultimate defeat, so we no longer have to cower when we think about appearing before God. Because of Jesus—and only through Him—we can know the Father and His love.\n\nMany people recoil at the gospel message, that people can only come to the Father through Jesus, and that there is salvation in no other name but Christ (Acts 4:12). They see these words as intolerant toward people of other religions, and an unnecessarily narrow road to an eternity in heaven.\n\nBut when we consider the heavy shadow of death hanging over us all, Jesus’s words become exceptionally beautiful. He did what no one else could: He destroyed our greatest enemy so that we could have the greatest hope. Instead of being narrow or hateful, Jesus’s insistence that salvation is found only in Him is a great invitation offered to every person. Salvation may only be through Him, but it is open to any and all who will come.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

He left the Catholic priesthood to follow God more closely—plus, he’d fallen in love with a woman and they wanted to marry. He struggled his entire life with alcoholism and self-hatred, among other things. And he wrote a book called The Ragamuffin Gospel, which has been an encouragement to so many believers.\n\nBut for me, it was one of his other books, Abba’s Child, that made the biggest impression on me, because it introduced me to a phrase that has stuck with me since I first read it: “For me the most radical demand of Christian faith lies in summoning the courage to say yes to the present risenness of Jesus Christ” (emphasis, mine).\n\nThe present risenness of Jesus Christ is the belief that the resurrection isn’t limited to either the past or the future, but that His power is always present tense, always active. Jesus is here, right now, right here. Actually believing that radically affects the way we live because resurrection is all about LIFE.\n\n“I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, even if he dies, will live. Everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” (John 11:25–26).\n\nThat’s what Jesus said to Martha in the thick of her grief over losing her brother, Lazarus. Scripture tells us “Jesus wept” over His friend’s death, grieving with the rest of the community (v.35). Then Martha and Mary, the disciples, and the people of Bethany—they all witnessed the radical resurrection power within Jesus when He said, “Remove the stone…. Lazarus, come out!” (vv.39,43). And Lazarus did just that.\n\nThe present risenness of Jesus Christ (remember, this miracle was prior to the cross) transformed that day from something absent of hope to something brimming with wonder. And that power is still present in our lives today, whether we’re leaving an established path to follow a new horizon, struggling with an addiction we just can’t seem to outrun, pursuing a romantic relationship with someone, writing books, raising children, burying the dead, witnessing the miracle of babies being born, or tending to the old as they take their final breaths. Every aspect of our lives is shot straight through with meaning because of the present risenness of Jesus Christ—right here, right now. Because He said, “I am the resurrection and the life,” we can courageously face any and all things with confidence, as we partner with Him in His redemption of the world.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    In the ancient world, it was expected and assumed that good citizens would lay down their lives for the glory of their city, their emperor, and their gods. It was certainly not assumed that the gods would lay down their lives for mere mortals. This would have been an embarrassing trespass of carefully established classes and social strata, of which the gods were the highest and most powerful, but not necessarily the most noble or generous.\n\nIn our modern world, where our thoughts have been shaped and influenced by two millennia of “Christ-figure” type stories in film, literature, and dramatic works, the Good Shepherd is a bit less surprising. But make no mistake, to Jesus’s listeners, the Good Shepherd, who would lay down His life for His sheep, was radically revolutionary. His sacrifice turned the world of gods and men on its head. Never in their wildest dreams did first century readers assume that the gods would move in such a way.\n\nThat Jesus parses out the difference between the true Good Shepherd and hired hands, should give us pause even today as we consider whose power and authority we place our lives and futures under. Are we trusting a political figure to save us from misfortune? Are we looking for a motivational speaker or public thinker to give us the secrets to success? Are we hoping that our spouse or significant other will be the one who will truly light the way to happiness and fulfillment, like our own North Star?\n\nAll of these voices can contain wisdom, truth, and love, and they may not be malevolent in their own right. They’re just not enough. Only God can love us perfectly, wholly, and altruistically. Only the Good Shepherd is consistent in laying down His life for His sheep and relentless in pursuing the one who has strayed from the ninety-nine. (Matthew 18:12).\n\nIt seems that this parable calls us to a couple of higher realities—the first being to make sure our lives are unequivocally placed under the guidance, correction, and leading of the true Good Shepherd. God’s people know His voice. Test the voices you’re absorbing and channeling against the Word, and be sure to follow the Shepherd in all things.\n\nThe second is to follow in the Shepherd’s way. As He lays down His life, so must we. For some of us, especially many of our brave brothers and sisters around the world, this may be a literal laying down. For those of us who aren’t called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice, we honor and love the Good Shepherd by choosing to daily lay down our will, preferences, and comforts to love those whom God has placed around us. The embodied love of the Shepherd calls us to love, not in theory, but in action. May we follow His lead.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    As a result of our family moving around a lot while I was growing up, I often found myself about a year or two younger than my classmates. For the most part, this wasn’t much of a problem until I entered high school and the rest of my classmates were getting their driver’s licenses long before I could, and then again in college when it came to getting into concerts.\n\nIn fact, I was once unceremoniously thrown out of a concert venue—in front of all of my friends, who were of age and who might’ve snickered a little bit at my comical misfortune. The bouncers were pretty courteous as far as bouncers go. Thankfully, they didn’t rough me up or anything, but boy, my pride sure did take a beating.\n\nEarlier that evening, I had known there was no way I was going to get in the front door, so I walked in the stage entrance behind the band, sort of just acting like I belonged. Well, that worked for about five minutes until someone noticed me and saw that I was way out of place. Before I knew it, I was sitting on the curb waiting for my ride home. All my friends were enjoying a show that I could only hear in muffled tones through the cinder block walls—not a fun experience. Though relatively mild in nature, I was reaping the lackluster fruit of not entering through the proper channel: what John refers to in our reading today as “the gate.”\n\nMany of the sayings of Jesus in the Gospels are quite comforting, things that we’d love to emblazon on some shiplap for our kitchens. Yet, there are also some that we could call “the hard sayings of Jesus.” These tough words are less frequently printed on posters or wall hangings. Nevertheless, they are true, weighty, and pertinent to our daily lives. In the very beginning of John chapter 10, we encounter one of them, when Jesus says, “Truly I tell you, anyone who doesn’t enter the sheep pen by the gate but climbs in some other way is a thief and a robber” (John 10:1). These words might be a little hard to understand, let alone find comfort in, but man, is it crucial to our eternal trajectory and growth as followers of Jesus. Entering through “the gate” (v.7), which Jesus identifies as Himself, isn’t merely a formality. It is a spiritual necessity.\n\nWe read in Ezekiel 34 that God promised a shepherd for His people long before the coming of Jesus. What’s mindblowing about Jesus is that He came not only as the guide, but also the gate. He says, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you know me, you will also know my Father. From now on you do know him and have seen him” (John 14:6–7).\n\nGetting thrown out of a concert? Mildly embarrassing. Getting tossed out of the Good Shepherd’s eternal, life-giving, soul-fulfilling pastures? Devastating.\n\nThough it can be tempting to take a shortcut or jump the wall, the only way to find peace, rest, and wholeness in the Jesus-pasture is by entering through the proper door: Him. There’s no cover charge. No minimum-age requirement. Just a free-handed invitation to surrender your life to God through Jesus Christ. All are welcome, but there’s only one door. Friend, make sure you enter that-a-way.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

Anyone who follows me will never walk in the darkness but will have the light of life” (John 8:12).\n\nJesus made these statements during the “Festival of Shelters” (or Tabernacles), which was a celebration of freedom for the people of Israel, commemorating their miraculous exodus from slavery in Egypt. During the feast, large torches were lit to recall how God’s presence led the way in a pillar of fire (see Exodus 13:21). It was in the shadow of four large torches, said to light up a whole section of the city, that Jesus identified Himself as the true and ultimate light of God’s presence, the light of the world. Jesus came to overcome the darkness of sin which separates us from God.\n\nSince Adam and Eve first sinned in the garden, we have each acted like gods of our own lives, even as we’ve alienated ourselves from the true God who loves us. The Bible teaches that outside of God’s grace, we actually prefer the darkness to the light (John 3:19). Just like our first parents, we hide, afraid to be seen by God, and blaming others for our own broken choices. This dark rebellion against God is not the way it is supposed to be. Sadly, no matter how desperate we become, we are not able to muster our own light. We need the light of another. God, in His mercy, provided Jesus, the light of the world, who makes the light of life available to everyone who follows Him.\n\nJohn’s Gospel was written to persuade his readers that Jesus was the long-awaited Messiah. There were those who saw the signs Jesus performed and heard the incredible statements He made and recognized Him for who He was, the Savior of the world. These followers stepped out of the darkness and into the light. But there were others who witnessed the same aspects of Jesus’s ministry and rejected Him, refusing to leave their familiar darkness behind.\n\nToday, we have the same choice before us. Do you believe that Jesus is the light of the world, the long-promised Messiah who rescues people from sin and makes all things new? He lovingly invites us to follow Him out of the darkness of sin and into His marvelous light (1 Peter 2:9). In the fullness of time, our Father raised up our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to enlighten our hearts with the knowledge of His love. May He grant us the grace to follow Him.\n\nWritten by Rob Wheeler\n\n                ",

One such example was Emperor Qin of China. By the time he was forty years old, he was sacrificing to mountains and rivers, and spending the remainder of his waking moments searching for immortals. Seriously. At one point he sent a group of scholars to search for a famous Taoist master who had gained immortality by eating a certain flower. The scholars never found the flower-eating master, and years later, Emperor Qin experienced what is appointed for us all—death. The once living emperor died.\n\nIt’s easy to look down our sophisticated noses at such simplistic notions, but we still engage in our own immortality projects today. In 2019, the health and fitness industry did a whopping $30 billion in business. Seriously. And while few of us would come right out and say, “I want to avoid death,” most of us readily admit we want to live as long as we possibly can, and we’re willing to try or do or pay anything to that end. It’s a safe bet that if a current scientist discovered there were high chances at immortality by eating a certain flower, the farmer who owned a field of those flowers would suddenly be a very wealthy man indeed.\n\nAfter a satisfyingly baskets-left-over miracle involving bread, the multitudes heard Jesus refer to the bread that Moses gave, the manna that saved the lives of their ancestors in the wilderness. They knew that story well. But then they heard Jesus talk of a bread from heaven that would surpass the manna of Exodus, a bread that would guarantee eternal life. With that, Jesus had their attention, and the people cried, “Sir, give us this bread always!” (John 6:34). Jesus answered, declaring: “I am the bread of life… No one who comes to me will ever be hungry, and no one who believes in me will ever be thirsty again” (v.35).\n\nEssentially Jesus was telling them, “Psssst! It’s me, standing right here in front of you. I am the bread of life, that bread from heaven.” He then followed with:\n\n“The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day, because my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him” (vv.54–56).\n\nHis declarations, true as they were, proved to be too much for some. It was then, Scripture tells us, that many of His disciples turned back and stopped following.\n\nFrom our vantage point, it’s easy to be disappointed with those literal-minded, short-sighted early disciples, the ones who stopped following Him. But how many of us are willing to abandon any and all life-enhancing, life-prolonging “bread” in favor of the only food that brings eternal life? To those who stood before Him, and to us as well, Jesus says, “I am that bread. Feast on me.”\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

But my dad did take the train every morning from our home on Long Island to his office in Manhattan. And I had heard him called an “engineer” more than once. So, without really understanding what my dad did every day at work, I put two and two together and imagined my dad was a train engineer. I pictured him wearing overalls and a conductor’s hat, pulling on the cord that makes the whistle blow. “All aboard!” (I guess I assumed he changed out of the pinstripe suit that he left our house in every morning once he got to the station.)\n\nNeedless to say, I was a bit disappointed when I discovered the truth. There was, of course, nothing wrong with his job—it was a good job, and he provided well for our family—but at recess, it wasn’t the kind of job that impressed other kindergarteners. Race car driver, astronaut, cowboy, and superhero were the best dad jobs—even if they were made up.\n\nThe conversation Jesus has with a group of Jews in John 8 sounds a lot like a playground argument over who has the coolest dad. Jesus talked about His Father. Then the Jews talked about their father, Abraham. Jesus countered by saying their father was, in fact, not Abraham or God, but the devil. That didn’t go over too well. “If you were Abraham’s children,” Jesus told them, “you would do what Abraham did. But now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this. You’re doing what your father does” (vv.39–41). Burn.\n\nThis back and forth was never really about dads though—it was about Jesus’s identity. To the casual observer, it must have seemed that Jesus was out of His mind. He was saying truly outrageous things: that He was sent by the Father (v.16); that He had come down from heaven (v.23); and that whoever believes in Him will never die (v.51). With each statement, the Jews grew more upset. But Jesus saved the best for last: “Before Abraham was, I am” (v.58). The Greek words translated “I am” here are the same words used in the Greek translation of the Old Testament when God revealed Himself to Moses in the burning bush (Exodus 3:14). Jesus was openly claiming to be Yahweh. And that was just too much for the Jews who heard. That’s why, in that very moment, “they picked up stones to throw at him” (John 8:59).\n\nWhen people come face to face with Jesus as He truly is, there’s often a strong reaction. Some fall down in worship, while others beg for mercy. And still others, like this group of Jews in John 8, look for rocks. Make no mistake though—how you respond to Jesus is really all that counts.\n\nWhat matters is not whether you can trace your lineage back to Abraham. It’s not about your family, race, or nationality. It’s always about Jesus. He was there before Abraham. He was there before Adam. He was there before time itself. The only thing that matters in this life and the next is whether or not we belong to Him. He’s better than all the race car drivers, astronauts, cowboys, and superheroes combined. (Oh—and train conductors, too.)\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Jesus changes everything. If I were to try to summarize the message of the New Testament in one sentence, that might be it. Jesus’s presence required a response from everyone He enountered, including those closest to Him.\n\n“Who do you say that I am?” Jesus asked His disciples (Matthew 16:15). I wonder if any of them knew this question would be the most important of their lives. Peter, for all his trademark bumbling impulsiveness, was the first with the right answer: “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God” (v.16). It’s the “good confession,” one that every believer makes as they receive their adoption into God’s family. But it takes a lifetime to work out how this truth changes everything. It takes continual reminders to move this good confession from our heads to our hearts and then out through our hands. We are all in process.\n\nI’d like to think Peter was only illustrating this truth for us when he decided to let his impetuosity take the wheel shortly after receiving a gold star for his confession. It happened when Jesus started talking about the plan—the one where He lays down His life and then takes it up again. You know, the plan where Jesus overthrows the forces of sin and death. The one where He reverses the curse that has befallen our world. That’s when Peter called Jesus over to rebuke Him. I catch myself shaking my head when I read that phrase in Matthew’s Gospel. But there it is: “Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him” (v.22).\n\nPeter knew who Jesus was, but he wasn’t prepared for all that meant. He couldn’t believe that the Messiah would be killed. Or that Jesus must die because of Peter’s own sin. The rest of Peter’s story, recorded in the New Testament, reveals his ongoing struggle to reconcile who Jesus is—Peter’s own good confession—with how that truth can, and should, change the world. Peter tried to defend Jesus when Jesus needed no defenders (John 18:10–11), and he denied Jesus when his life was threatened because of their friendship (Matthew 26:69–75). But Peter also led the first Gentile to the Lord when he came to understand that Jesus died for people of every race (Acts 10:1–48), and later in life he was willing to die for his good confession (2 Peter 1:13–15).\n\nJesus changes everything. So, every day, we must be prepared for how He wants to change us. May we be people who can make the good confession with our lips, but not only with our lips. May this good confession of who Jesus is spill out into everything we say and do. Amen.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

An unknown visionary with limited capital but a great idea can sell a million dollars’ worth of a product on Kickstarter before she’s even built a prototype. Amazon star-ratings can make or break a new book before its official launch. And a movie can be sunk at the box office if it doesn’t fare well on Rotten Tomatoes. These days, the Internet has given everyone a voice, and our voices are being used in the public square to vote for the products, services, and institutions we like.\n\nThis actually isn’t anything new. Word of mouth and recommendations from friends have always been powerful. Social media has just amplified things as of late. If you think about it, word of mouth is precisely how the early Church spread across the Roman Empire. I don’t say this to discount the signs and wonders that the Lord performed through the apostles and other early Christians. Rather, I’m affirming the power of proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God.\n\nWhen we proclaim the Lord’s goodness with our voices, we lift up His name to a listening world. There is worship in such an act. Though our speech might be directed toward other people, it is God who is being praised.\n\nIn John 9, Jesus healed a man born blind. He spit in the dust and mixed it up into clay in His hands. Then He anointed the beggar’s eyes with the stuff and instructed him to wash in a nearby pool. It sounds gross, but it was worth it for the man, because when he washed the holy mud out of his eyes, he could see. The world that had been darkness his entire life was now filled with brilliant shades of blue, green, brown, and red. Sounds that his brain had processed in mystery now had shape. And with eyes wide open, this man opened his mouth just as wide to proclaim what had happened. Although He didn’t know precisely who Jesus was at first, he could not be silenced. He told everyone who asked exactly what God had done for him—even when the Pharisees cast him out of his local synagogue.\n\nTo be cast out of the synagogue was a bit more serious than being asked to leave a worship service. It was an official way of being ostracized by the entire community, including one’s own family, since the synagogue was the center of local Jewish life. But yet, though it cost him everything, this man who was once blind refused to shut up about Jesus. This is the kind of proclamation God wants from us—to be willing to lose everything because we just can’t shut up about how good He is. That is a sacrifice of praise.\n\nLet us be people who can’t stop talking about the gospel. Let us be filled with awe and wonder at what God has done for us. Let us be people who proclaim the truth of God’s Word to a world in need. And let our words be received by our Father as the worship due His name. “For I will proclaim the LORD’s name. Declare the greatness of our God” (Deuteronomy 32:3).\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Animal sacrifices are gross. Just read through the book of Leviticus, and you’ll be glad you don’t live in the days of temple sacrifice. There’s blood being sprinkled, poured, wiped on the altar, and collected in jars. Animals are cut up so that some parts can be burned, others can be eaten, and still others can be taken outside the camp and burned differently. All in all, it’s a mess.\n\nBut there’s also something quite beautiful about it.\n\nThrough the sacrificial system, God made a way for His people to come close and worship Him. The tabernacle, and later the temple, housed the very presence of God. That reality defies our limited ability to comprehend, but it’s true nonetheless. God had come close. His space was sacred, and to keep our sinfulness and uncleanness from defiling God’s throne room on earth, the sacrificial system was given. The blood of animals purified the place of worship so that men and women could come near.\n\nAt their core, the various sacrifices described in the Old Testament were about worship. The people gave their livestock—the best of the best of what they could afford. It was costly, always an act of ascribing to God the honor due His name. There was no low-priced, discount option that would do the trick. A sacrifice was just that—a sacrifice to make.\n\nFast-forward to the New Testament era in which you and I live. Jesus has paid the once-and-forever price to atone for our sin so that those He has redeemed can draw near to God, no animal sacrifices required. The Holy Spirit now lives inside those of us who are believers. We are now the temple of God, so everywhere we tread is sacred space, especially when we gather together as the Church. But that doesn’t mean our days of making sacrifices are over.\n\nWhat was planted in seed form in the Old Testament grows into full bloom in the New. So, we should expect that what was required of the sacrificial system under the Mosaic Covenant only expands under the New Covenant—and it does. God no longer requires the blood of bulls and goats. Now He wants us—you and me—given over to Him as living sacrifices (Romans 12:1–2). Everything we have, everything we are, and everything we do is to be given over to God. We are His, and our lives should show it.\n\nAbout a thousand years before Christ, David got it. He wrote, “The sacrifice pleasing to God is a broken spirit. You will not despise a broken and humbled heart, God” (Psalm 51:17). It is this “broken spirit’ and “humbled heart” that allows a person to become a living sacrifice. Pride has no place in the life of a Christian. We have been bought and paid for. We belong to God, and our lives ought to reflect this fact. Our sacrifices may not be as bloody as they were under the Old Covenant, but they ought to be even more costly.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    A few years after college, I rented a house with three friends. It wasn’t a big house. It wasn’t fancy or new. In fact, the home’s single greatest feature was its location—right down the street from the church the four of us attended. It might seem as though that detail shouldn’t matter much, but it wasn’t the short commute on Sunday mornings we cared about. Rather, it was that our rental house became a second home for dozens of our friends.\n\nOur church had a very active young adult ministry—a large group of twenty-somethings who volunteered and served throughout the week. Whether it was Sunday school, Wednesday night small groups, youth ministry, adventure camps for young kids, the local soup kitchen, or one of a hundred other discipleship activities and ministries, someone from our group of friends was there. And because our house was just down the road, people were always stopping by. We ate meals together, prayed together, played games together. There was usually music, lots of laughing, and long talks late into the night. In some ways, it was how I imagined the early church might have been: “Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the temple, and broke bread from house to house. They ate their food with joyful and sincere hearts” (Acts 2:46). At our house, the celebration never seemed to end.\n\nChristians ought to be, above all else, people who know how to celebrate. I say, “above all else,” because what is true for all believers, whether eight or eighty, whether Presbyterian or Pentecostal, is the reality of grace. We have all been forgiven a debt more enormous that Mount Everest, and we’ve been invited into a wonderful, eternal life with God. No matter what happens in this world, nothing can take that away from us (Romans 8:38–39). So why shouldn’t we celebrate? Why shouldn’t we be ready to party at any moment?\n\nIn fact, I believe God expects us to be people of celebration. Jubilant hearts are worshipful hearts, because joy like that only comes in response to the goodness of God. That’s why, when God gave instructions for the Old Testament festivals, He commanded His people to celebrate (Exodus 23:14).\n\nIt’s why King David, a man after God’s own heart (1 Samuel 13:14), danced with abandon at the coming of the ark into Jerusalem. And when his wife Michal called him out for what she considered an undignified display, his response was to double-down on his worship of celebration: “I will dance before the LORD, and I will dishonor myself and humble myself even more” (2 Samuel 6:21–22).\n\nIt’s why Jesus earned a reputation as a drunkard and a glutton (Matthew 11:19). He wasn’t either of those things, of course, but He got those labels because He loved to celebrate with people, inviting them to enjoy a foretaste of the party God has prepared for those who love Him.\n\nAt the end of history, the Bible tells us, there will be another party, the wedding feast of the Lamb. I have no doubt it will make even the most lavish and joyful of earthly parties seem like a funeral in the rain. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be preparing ourselves right now. Let us be people who know what we’ve been given. Let us be people who soak in the goodness of God and can’t help but beam in response. And let us be people who celebrate, who dance, and who throw the best parties.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    In Matthew chapter 6, Jesus paints a picture of someone praying in a public place.\n\nThe problem is not so much praying in public. Public prayers are a part of the life of the church. We need public prayers in corporate worship. We need prayers in small group settings, and in meetings of leaders, and in Sunday School classes. That is not the problem. The problem is why this person was praying in public.\n\nWhenever I read this passage I always picture a religious leader of the day standing on a street corner lifting his arms and praying very loudly. I also picture them closing their eyes and every now and then they open them a little just—a squint, a peek—to make sure they are being watched.\n\nWhether Jesus was talking about a religious leader or not, I cannot be sure. But outside of that I feel pretty good about the mental picture I have conjured. After all, Jesus does describe this person as a hypocrite. Think about what a hypocrite is. A hypocrite is someone who does something that looks one way but is contrary to who they really are. There is a lack of consistency, and it’s intentional. The person praying in Jesus’s example prays so others can see him praying. He wants to look like he is worshipping God but, actually, he is worshiping himself.\n\nMy first reaction toward this description is one of condemnation. I feel as if I have watched this person in action. He prays in a way that appears to sort of “show off” his spirituality. He uses words that sound inauthentic and just a little spiritual. It is kind of sickening to witness, isn’t it? The attention moves away from God and moves towards the person who is praying.\n\nMy second reaction is to confess that I have been this person. I have been the one trying to impress others with my prayers. I have used prayer to gain the praise of others, hoping that they would acknowledge and affirm me over worshiping God in that moment. That’s hard to admit now.\n\nBut if prayer is anything, it is worship of God. Prayer is saying, “God, you are glorious and worthy of praise. You are the one in authority. You are the one who provides my physical needs and cares for my soul.” Even when all we can do is seek out a small, “Help me, God”—even that is worship through prayer. It is the epitome of praise to ask for help from the One you depend on for everything. Jesus invites us to pray in this way:\n\n“But when you pray, go into your private room, shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you” (Matthew 6:6).\n\nDo you hope to express prayers that are focused on worshiping God, rather than yourself? I think the key is remembering how dependent we are upon God for everything. When we realize this, our prayers will become more authentic and vulnerable. We are then free to experience God in relationship as we share our lives with Him. Talking and listening to Him. Enjoying Him. This, too, is an act of worship.\n\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

In those moments, my prayers feel hollow, and my singing becomes mechanical. And, as the pastor begins to explain and apply the biblical text, it’s difficult to receive because I find myself defensive and uneasy. All the while, God’s Spirit is gently and clearly revealing my need for repentance. This weekly experience that is meant to be life-giving can be a painful reminder of my sin.\n\nMy unrepentant heart can hinder my relationship with God; it can make me feel as though there is a divide between us—one that, in reality, no longer exists because of Christ’s finished work on the cross. This feeling of distance can creep up in any form of human relationship, making it easy to mistakenly ascribe it to my relationship with God.\n\nSalvation is a gift of grace for sinners like you and me. We are saved by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone. True salvation results in the ongoing process of sanctification. Throughout Scripture, God reminds us that it is His work to sanctify His people by His power. Our status before God is a work that He alone has achieved. Therefore, we are to live in accordance with the identity that He has already declared over us.\n\nThis is good news! God has set us apart and called us His own. Those who are in Christ Jesus are called a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). We are “a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his possession, so that [we] may proclaim the praises of the one who called [us] out of darkness into his marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9). And in response to God’s grace, forgiveness, and acceptance, God’s people are to heed this instruction: “Consecrate yourselves and be holy, for I am the LORD your God” (Leviticus 20:7). We are to commit ourselves to Him—heart, mind, body, and soul—and follow His ways, which are so much better than our own (Isaiah 55:8–9).\n\nConsider again your worship of God. If we acknowledge that our entire lives are worship, as Paul reminds us in Romans, we must present ourselves as “a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is [our] true act of worship” (Romans 12:1)—the daily submission and consecration of every area of our lives.\n\nVictory has already been won with the empty tomb of Christ, but our daily battles can distract us from living in accordance with that victory. We must not forget who we are and who God has declared us to be in Christ. In those moments when we are tempted to give in to sin, we are to lean in to God’s power. By His Spirit, who helps us and counsels us, we are given the strength to turn toward Him.\n\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    As I was going through some boxes recently, I ran across some journals from the year after I finished college. Reading through them reintroduced me to a young man who constantly felt like he didn’t measure up spiritually. Each page bled with “I should be,” “I need to be,” and “I feel cold spiritually.” It’s no wonder that I felt distant from the Lord; I was focused on myself and my shortcomings rather than God and His matchless grace in my life.\n\nI know I am not alone. How often do we feel like God is a thousand miles away because all we can think about is how far short we fall? Today’s readings offer a surprising antidote to our consistent hand wringing over our spiritual condition—thankfulness. When our focus is on ourselves and our failures, God will feel distant and praise will not be on our lips. However, when we purposely stop that nonsense and instead look at who God is and the wondrous things He has done, our hearts will be drawn to Him because we will have a never-ending supply of things to thank Him for.\n\nThe psalm Asaph and his relatives sing in 1 Chronicles 16 begins and ends with thankfulness. The first call to give thanks to the Lord invites every one of God’s people to become a worship leader who points others to the wondrous works God has accomplished. The emphasis on singing should not surprise us. In the Old Testament, God winning a mighty victory for His people is often followed by a song.\n\nThe second call to thankfulness, in verse 34, focuses on giving thanks for the character of God. “Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his faithful love endures forever.” We need to see this twin emphasis on God’s character and His works because they are intimately connected. Have you ever done something sinful or foolish and then said, “That isn’t who I am”? God never has. His acts are always in line with His character.\n\nDavid focused here and in Psalm 136 on God’s “faithful love” which “endures forever.” God’s “faithful love” moves Him to act for the good of His people, the preservation of His people, and the salvation of His people. The writers of Scripture frequently recognize the beauty of God’s covenant love and celebrate it. In Psalm 63, David said God’s faithful love is “better than life.” God faithfully loves His people and acts on their behalf out of His love for them.\n\nOne way to stir your affections for the Lord is to meditate on His attributes and actions as they are revealed in Scripture. As you think, thank God for being who He is and ask Him to help you see His character through His work in your life. As you pray and meditate on this daily, you will be paying more attention and will begin to see the beauty of God everywhere in your life.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

The drama of Daniel’s obedience must have been new and fresh to me, and the outcome extraordinary. I wonder what my initial thoughts were.\n\nDid I see the danger coming to Daniel?\nDid I see the foolishness of Darius?\nDid I see the beauty of Daniel’s prayers in the face of death?\nDid I look down into the den of lions with Darius and wonder if Daniel would be okay?\nDid I rejoice like Darius after hearing Daniel’s voice?\nDid I rejoice at the comeuppance received by those who betrayed Daniel?\n\nAt some point, I must’ve heard the story as I sat in a carpeted room with felt characters and bulletin boards and probably a dozen other kids. But having grown up in the church, that memory has disappeared with so many others, along with a childlike faith I am so restless to recover.\n\nI find it hard to identify with Daniel. I do not live in a culture where I can lose my life by simply praying to God. Yes, I am safe to pray in private and in public, but neither is a good indicator of my devotion or capacity for obedience. Why is obedience so hard?\n\nI cannot speak for you, but if you’re anything like me, I think it comes from not really understanding what obedience actually is. For far too many years, I viewed obedience to God (and anyone else, for that matter) as a way to get what I wanted.\n\nIn the face of possible execution, Daniel continued to acknowledge and worship the one true God. “Three times a day he got down on his knees, prayed, and gave thanks to his God, just as he had done before” (Daniel 6:10). Come what may, Daniel obeyed God because he loved Him more than any other outcome or result. His obedience was an act of worship, because, to Daniel, allegiance to God was worth more than his own life. I know that in my own life, I have sometimes acted in obedience because I believed it would bring about a good result; my obedience was merely a means to an end.\n\nHow do we become more like Daniel, who worshiped God through obedience, even when it should have cost him his life? Perhaps we should begin by repenting of our disobedience, of our love of self over God, of worshiping the gifts over the Giver. But we cannot stop there. If we do, we will end up in despair.\n\nWe must remember and trust in the gospel—the good news of what Christ, the King of kings, has done to defeat sin and death on the cross. What’s more, we must receive the good news of being accepted and loved by Him. From this place of believing and receiving, we can move forward in true obedience as an act of worship, an overflowing of gratitude for what Christ has done for us.\n\nAnd if we fail? Then we are free to repent and believe it all again.\n\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

The Son of God, Jesus the Christ, gave himself up to a death He did not deserve so that we, people who deserve eternal death, would be released from its grip.\n\nWhen we think about our own lives as Christians, we may be tempted to believe that one of the primary ways we could “be like Jesus” would be to physically take a bullet for a loved one, to trade our life to save the life of another. But is that all there is to it?\n\nOne way we can worship God is by moving beyond our tendency to focus on ourselves, to die daily to our selfish ways. The apostle Paul said we should “do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility, consider others better than [ourselves]. Everyone should look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others” (Philippians 2:3–4). As image-bearers of God, we bring Him glory when we consider the needs of others in this way.\n\nIn Mark 10, the disciples James and John are concerned with whether or not they will be permitted to sit at Jesus’s right and left hand in glory. Jesus explains the upside-down nature of power to them, that the weakest shall be the strongest and the greatest among them must be a slave to all. Then He tells them, “For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many” (v.45).\n\nNotice Jesus says, “For even the Son of Man did not come to be served,” as if to say, “If I, the literal Son of God, came to earth with the purpose of putting others before myself, you’d better believe your job is to serve others too.”\n\nSo why do we serve others? To make them feel good? To make us feel better about ourselves?\n\nNo, making everyone “feel good” isn’t usually at the root of Christian service. We serve others because Christ served us, and when we serve others, we are giving them a glimpse at what He is like. This is what it means to “glorify God.” In a sinful world full of people obsessed with fulfilling their own appetites, how otherworldly it must look when Christians are most concerned with helping others!\n\nWhether we’re teaching children’s Sunday school classes or bringing in the groceries or opening the door for a stranger—as God’s creation, we bear His image to a watching world. May we do it well, not out of duty, but from a heart bent toward worshiping our Creator.\n\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    In the old farm-country church where I was raised, there was a monthly tradition: Hymn Night. All the senior saints would fill up the pews and, for an hour or so, people would shout out hymn numbers so that we could all turn in our hymnals and sing together “How Firm A Foundation” or “Great Is Thy Faithfulness” or “Just As I Am.” My brother and I would try to keep serious faces as we’d yell out, “47!”—also known as the entire “Hallelujah” Chorus from Handel’s Messiah—eating up a good 20 minutes of hymn night, and at least taking some control over our own boredom. Because, of course, what could be more boring than a bunch of old people singing old songs?\n\nI think back on that time now, knowing the history of some of those old songs, and some of those people, and realize that there was probably a whole lot more going on than I understood. Singing together is not something our culture really does, outside of fight songs at football games, and that is our loss. There are powerful things that happen when we raise our voices together. Colossians 3:16 puts it this way:\n\n“Let the word of Christ dwell richly among you, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another through psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.”\n\nWhen we sing together, we are hearing the voices of our friends, our neighbors, and our families proclaiming the goodness and the promises of God. We are telling ourselves the gospel anew every time we do this. These familiar voices in our community—voices we know and trust—are reminding us that God is present and fighting for us, even when we forget or don’t feel it. This is one of the reasons it’s so important for children to hear their fathers sing in worship. They are watching as we witness to our communities and ourselves.\n\nThe story in Acts 16 shows us just how much power there really can be when we sing to our God, particularly in times of darkness and sorrow. Is the good news any less good when our circumstances aren’t? Not at all! It’s at our lowest point when the gospel is most beautiful and transformative.\n\nWe don’t really have an image of this in our modern Western culture. I live in the American South, though, where the generational wounds of slavery and oppression are still fresh. Amid the rolling hills and the Civil War battle markers you can almost still hear the Negro spirituals of slaves in the fields, crying out to God in lament and praise.\n\nThese were the melodies of hope in a hopeless place. Those songs were reminders that God had not abandoned His people, and that He was near to the broken-hearted. The voices of mothers and fathers singing together were seeds planted in the hearts of the children, who eventually grew to see a dawning light of deliverance in their circumstances. What’s more, those children would grow into a richer and more fervent faith, having witnessed their community praising and worshiping God in times of both joy and sorrow.\n\nThere aren’t a lot of earthquakes and jailbreaks on your typical Sunday morning, as there weren’t in the cotton fields of the South or on Hymn Nights in my hometown, but God is using our voices in worship together in powerful ways. Spiritual chains are being broken, hope is being restored, and we are slowly being transformed into the likeness of the One to whom we sing.\n\nI need to hear you, and you need to hear me. Lift your voices, Church! “Hallelujah! How good it is to sing to our God!”\n\nWritten by Andrew Osenga\n\n \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    For my money, it’s one of the strangest conversations in the Bible. Jesus is in a Samaritan village—a place most Jews avoided like the plague—and seeing a well, He asks a local woman for a drink. Now, respectable Jews in the first century didn’t fraternize with Samaritans at all, and Jewish men certainly didn’t socialize with women who weren’t close relatives. But Jesus, being Jesus, begins to make small talk with this Samaritan woman at the well. Except it isn’t exactly small talk. It quickly moves from a drink request, to a discussion about living water, to the woman’s five ex-husbands and her current relationship to, of all things, the nature of worship.\n\nWhat does worship have to do with anything? I once thought. But the truth is, worship is at the heart of everything we do. It’s central to who we are as human beings. In fact, as people made to worship we can’t help it. Our worship may not always look like singing with hands spread toward heaven. In fact, most of our worship looks fairly ordinary and mundane. But we are a worshiping species all the same.\n\nIf our worship isn’t directed toward the one true God, it’s directed toward whatever has captured our heart’s attention. It might be the god of a false religion or the gods of money, sex, power, comfort, or a million other things besides. John Calvin was right when he said, “Man’s nature, so to speak, is a perpetual factory of idols.”\n\nWorship that is good and right and healthy, on the other hand, is always directed toward the God who made the heavens and the earth. He is the God of the Bible, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. “‘To whom will you compare me, or who is my equal?’ asks the Holy One” (Isaiah 40:25).\n\nWorship, pure and simple, is our response to who God is and what He has done. And most worship isn’t accompanied by a certain physical posture or music and lyrics. It has more to do with the posture of the heart. Jesus told the Samaritan woman, “An hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and in truth. Yes, the Father wants such people to worship him” (John 4:23).\n\nTo worship in Spirit is to worship God wherever we are and whatever we’re doing. Gone are the days of seeking God’s presence at a temple in Jerusalem. The Holy Spirit now indwells all believers, inviting us to give everything we have and everything we are to God at every moment. To worship in truth is to worship the God who has revealed Himself in the Bible and in the Person of Jesus Christ. We are to praise Him with our lives for who He actually is, not who we imagine Him to be or who we think He ought to be.\n\nTaken together, these two elements of worship are an invitation to intimacy with the Father. With the “Spirit” part of the equation, God says, I want to be a part of everything you do, every day. With the “truth” part, He says, I want you to draw closer, to know the real Me. True worship is a gift we bring to God, but in living a life of worship, we soon find that it is also a gift God gives to us.\n\n“Thou hast made us for thyself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it finds its rest in thee.” —Augustine of Hippo\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I have a pastor friend who used to say, “Except for the grace of God, at any given moment, every one of us is less than a week away from virtually ruining our lives.” For some of us, we crossed that line a long time ago.\n\nDo you believe you are your past? That the bad things you’ve done have so defined who you are that you will never be anyone other than the screw-up who made all those mistakes and committed all those sins? Do you know anyone who believes this about themselves and needs to be brought in out of the relational cold?\n\nThe apostle Paul was a man like this. Before his conversion, he was committed to ridding the world of Christians. Then, he was converted to Christ by Jesus Himself while traveling to Damascus to round up Christians and have them put to death. If there ever were a lost cause, Paul was it.\n\nThree years after his conversion but before he had begun his ministry to the Roman world, Paul traveled to Jerusalem to meet with the apostles in that city. They were wary of him; they had every reason to be. After all, Paul had overseen the stoning death of Stephen, one of the deacons in the Jerusalem church.\n\nBarnabas likely knew Stephen personally, since they were both part of the church from its early days. And now he was being told Paul had become a Christian. Embracing Paul must have been complicated for Barnabas. Making room for Paul cost him something. He would have had to personally forgive Paul for the pain and suffering he had caused. Barnabas had felt the heat of the persecution Paul had ignited years before. Some of Barnabas’s close friends had been martyred, others tortured, and others were still living as exiles because of Paul’s behavior.\n\nNot only did Barnabas need to forgive Paul, he also had to believe in Paul’s call to minister the very gospel he once worked so hard to destroy. He had to trust that Paul was not a wolf trying to come in among the sheep Barnabas loved. So what did Barnabas do? He spoke with Paul and sought out the genuineness of his faith. He soon became convinced that the God who had raised Jesus from the dead had also given new life to this infamous Pharisee. So Barnabas took Paul by the hand and led him before the apostles. He stood as one with Paul, lending his own reputation in order to affirm God’s work in Paul’s life. When Barnabas put his arm around Paul, he wasn’t just confirming Paul’s calling to the apostles; he was confirming it to Paul too.\n\nThis is a beautiful picture of what it looks like to bring someone who feels like a lost cause in out of the cold. Hospitality for the lost cause can cost us something, and it usually involves risk. So why should we do it? Because Jesus did. And because none of us are very far from finding ourselves in the same place—where we’ve failed or sinned in some way that leaves us dependent on the kindness of a friend to pull us up from the pit of shame and accusation.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    This past summer, a college student stayed with us for a few weeks. It was truly a great experience, and when he left, we were sad to see him go. But his time with us was a reminder of what hospitality really looks like. When not at work, he was with us all day, every day. We didn’t have as much private time as a family. We spent more money on groceries. And I once had to run downstairs at five in the morning because he’d accidentally set off our home alarm.\n\nMaking room for anyone is tough because, as we learned with this college student we hosted, we really like our personal space and comfort. But biblical hospitality is about more than sharing a meal or inviting friends over. It is the work of making room in our lives for others. True hospitality is a posture of charity toward the poor, of welcome toward the displaced, and of humility and gentleness toward the hurting.\n\nWhen we think of making room for others in our lives, we should remember that the most important community we have is the one we have with our brothers and sisters in Christ. Through Jesus, we’ve been grafted into a family that supersedes our earthly families. Christ’s blood outlasts the blood you share with your mother or brother. So, our closest community should be our brothers and sisters in Christ, with whom we gather regularly in our local church.\n\nIn our culture, it’s easy to treat the most important things in life like a buffet. We pick and choose what we want and what makes us happy; we don’t commit to anything we don’t want on our plate. But to make room for other Christians, we have to partake in the whole spread. Most of us make plenty of time for ourselves, our friends, and our family, but are we willing to make room for our local church family?\n\nActs 4 describes the early church this way: “Now the entire group of those who believed were of one heart and mind, and no one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but instead they held everything in common” (v.32). Here, “everything in common” means that they shared everything, not just a hobby or two. In other words, the early church held the things of this world loosely so that none of the brothers and sisters would go without. We are called to do the same.\n\nWe are joined together by Christ with people who are not always like us, who don’t share our interests, and whose flaws or idiosyncrasies can sometimes drive us up the wall. But these divisions are superficial. In the Church, we are one body, the body of Christ. And so, while living in biblical community can sometimes be tough, it is also the healthiest way to live and essential to following our Savior. After all, just as He died for us, He also died for the person in the pew next to you. We are called to love those Jesus loves.\n\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

In my case, this means I’ve heard a lot of Scripture read from the King James Version. One of the first verses I memorized is from the Gospel of Matthew. In it, “Jesus says, ‘Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven’” (Matthew 19:14).\n\nAs a boy I remember hearing that passage in Sunday School and thinking the word suffer could mean only one thing: “to hurt.” Maybe someone tried to clarify this for me, but I cannot recall a single grown-up telling us that, in this case, the word meant “to allow, or permit.”\n\nSo back then, in my mind’s eye, I envisioned Jesus cutting through the crowd of disciples and onlookers, toward these little suffering children, who were as innocent as dew but happened to be born in a time when the small and weak had no voice at all. I imagined Jesus looked into their suffering faces, possibly winking, and saying, “C’mere.” And so they did.\n\nI’m willing to bet there were some suffering children who ran unbridled into His arms at full speed. I’m also willing to bet there were some sufferers who held back, timid, uncertain of the man before them and His designs. But the story indicates that they all eventually came to Jesus. There must have been something about Jesus that wooed them, something that drew them to Him.\n\nHospitality toward children is essential for the believer. Jesus said His kingdom belongs to “such as these” (Matthew 19:14). Unfortunately, our society can, at times, still struggle with impatience and indifference toward the small, vulnerable, and weak. In this way, children are still suffering, still defenseless.\n\nMaking straight the way for children to see and experience the love and blessing of Christ is important, grown-up work. In other words, it’s hard. Why? Well, that’s an easy answer. It’s hard because it often involves upsetting us adults and our adult plans. Regardless of your preferred Bible translation, this remains clear: If you don’t have room for the suffering children, then you don’t have room for the suffering Savior. So let them come. Amen.\n\nWritten by John Blase \n\n                ",

Some might say we live in the age of the refugee. It seems barely a day goes by without reading about another global tragedy in the headlines. If we’re not careful, we can become so wrapped up in “the issues” that we forget about the individual mothers, fathers, daughters, and sons being displaced around the globe.\n\nWithout warning, our hearts can grow calloused toward people who seem far away, so unlike us. But the truth is, we have all been like the early Israelites, strangers in a strange land (Leviticus 19:34). And in one sense, we still are. Scripture tells us that here on earth, no matter our level of comfort, we are not home.\n\nThat’s why God the Son stepped out of heaven and into our broken world: to rescue all those who would hear His voice. As we follow Him further and further out of darkness and into the light, we are called to help those we can along the way. With some of these “strangers,” that might mean offering spiritual encouragement and investment; with others, it might mean going out of our way to try to provide for a physical need.\n\nWhen we offer hospitality to the stranger, we honor God, whether that stranger is a newcomer at church, a new hire at work, or a new immigrant in the community. In offering hospitality and love, especially to our brothers and sisters in Christ, we experience intimacy with God. This is a divine mystery, but one Jesus Himself confirms: “‘For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink; I was a stranger and you took me in; I was naked and you clothed me; I was sick and you took care of me; I was in prison and you visited me’” (Matthew 25:35–36).\n\nSo give aid, love freely, and live generously along the way.

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I am a widower, and I am raising four motherless children.\n\nBefore my late wife died after a two-and-a-half-year battle with cancer, I was put in contact with another widower. I didn’t have the courage to contact him until the scarlet “widower” title was seared onto my soul. Joining him in that title was not something I wanted. I didn’t want to have anything in common with him, no connection at all.\n\nWidowhood thrusts you into a new crowd, a crowd where you are a walking example of every married person’s deepest fear. No matter your age, no one wants to be thrown back to junior high with all the pimples and insecurities and clumsiness. Widowhood makes you feel as though everything you’ve built to guide you and give you a sense of purpose in this life is now gone.\n\nOn caring for those who grieve, Isaiah 1:17 says this: “Learn to do what is good. Pursue justice. Correct the oppressor. Defend the rights of the fatherless. Plead the widow’s cause.” So how exactly do we “plead the widow’s cause”? By acknowledging their grief and treating it with justice and compassion.\n\nThe brokenness of the widow and the orphan may not be fully understood unless you have walked those same paths. But full understanding is not the goal. Compassion for a brokenness you may never know is the goal. This sort of compassion really stretches you beyond your equipping, which is what makes this particular kind of hospitality such a great service. God mentions this kind of care numerous times in Scripture because caring for orphans and widows is close to His heart. He says, “I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you” (John 14:18).\n\nThe fear of the widow and the orphan, of anyone grieving a great loss, is that they will only be known as people who have been left and abandoned. However, Jesus has promised never to leave us. Personally, it’s a promise that means more to me than I could ever say.\n\nWhen we make room for orphans and widows, we celebrate Jesus’s promise to abide with us and comfort us, even as we comfort others. We declare our own intention to be present, our ears and our hearts open to grieve with them. When we make room for those who’ve lost much, we remind them that there is a place at God’s table reserved especially for them.\n\nWritten by Jason Tippetts\n\n                ",

There are exceptions, of course, but this is the general rule. It’s even in the Bible. Before we can get through a full three chapters of Genesis, God declares that the offspring of the woman will one day crush the head of the serpent (Genesis 3:15). Because our God is perfectly just and perfectly righteous, we know instinctively that no wicked deed should go unpunished and that good ought to triumph in the end.\n\nBut what about those stories that go beyond good vanquishing evil? I’m thinking of Luke Skywalker, who offered a new beginning to Darth Vader, even as the dark lord threatened to murder him. Or there’s Bilbo Baggins, who pitied the ring-crazed Gollum, refusing to kill the twisted creature. And how many times has Superman saved Lex Luthor from certain death?\n\nThere is a goodness that suprasses mere victory over evil, and it smells a lot like the gospel. To be sure, God will one day destroy evil, fully and finally, but in the meantime He offers salvation to people in rebellion. No one is too far gone. No one is beyond hope. And God is patient. He holds out an open hand to lost men and women, many of whom would spit in His face if given the chance (see Matthew 26:67; 27:30; Luke 23:34), “not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance” (2 Peter 3:9).\n\nOne of my favorite scenes in the Gospels is recorded in John 13. Jesus rises from the Last Supper, ties a towel around His waist, and begins washing each of His disciples’ feet. In the ancient world, the task of washing feet was reserved for the lowliest of servants. That’s because on those dusty roads, it was often hard to tell where the dirt ended and the animal waste began—and people walked just about everywhere. By selflessly scrubbing those one hundred and twenty filthy toes, Jesus left His friends (and us) an example to follow: we are to love one another.\n\nBut love is not reserved only for our friends. Jesus washed Peter’s feet, and John’s, and James’s, and worked His way down the line. At some point, He was face to feet with Judas, the disciple who would betray Him to the Jewish authorities in just a short while. And still, He washed dirt and grime from the traitor’s feet, knowing full well what evil was lurking in his heart (John 13:2–3,18–21).\n\nTrue love is not conditional. It is not a reward for good behavior. This is why Jesus could teach, “Love your enemies, do what is good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you… Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High. For he is gracious to the ungrateful and evil. Be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful” (Luke 6:27–28,35–36). We ought to love our betrayers and those who seek to do us harm, not because we can easily brush aside the pain they cause, but because our hope lies in a God who did not count our sins against us. He chose to love us, knowing full well the evil lurking in our hearts when we were far from Him. “We love because he first loved us” (1 John 4:19).\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

This illusion is easy to keep up if I don’t look too closely at my heart. Somewhere in there, I’ve been keeping a little list of names, offenses, and follies about the people I would rather avoid, shouldn’t trust, or frown upon. How could he act that way? How could she say those words and strut about with that attitude? However, when I stop to reconsider, pray, and open my Bible, I find that once again I’ve got a log in my eye. My own eyes don’t see clearly. My own heart doesn’t judge rightly.\n\nI am reminded of an anecdote about G.K Chesterton. According to the story, The Times of London posed this question to various reputable authors: “What’s wrong with the world?” Chesterton’s answer was brief: “I am.”\n\nSuch a confession is fitting for all of us. Though I may be inclined to judge others more harshly, I am guilty too. If the apostle Paul can call himself the chief of sinners (1 Timothy 1:15), then what should be my confession? How often have I arrogantly received God’s blessings as if they were merited by my own hard work, creativity, ingenuity, or integrity? How often have I fallen into sin and didn’t even notice? I bear the name of Christ, but in what ways do I live like the world?\n\nChrist’s words are a thunderous rebuke: “You will be judged by the same standard with which you judge others, and you will be measured by the same measure you use” (Matthew 7:2). Paul echoes this, saying, “Do you really think—anyone of you who judges those who do such things yet do the same—that you will escape God’s judgment?” (Romans 2:3).\n\nWhat can we say to this? No one is righteous, none of us (Romans 3:10). In the face of God’s righteousness, I have no answer in myself. I lay my hand on my mouth (Job 40:4). The moment we start counting our righteousness, we are attempting to gain merit by means of the law. But this law rightly condemns us, “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). For this reason, the highest mark of the Christian walk is not personal righteousness, but repentance. Therefore, my heart should be open not only for the prodigal, but also for his self-righteous elder brother.\n\nWe have all been blessed with the riches of God’s kindness, forbearance, and patience. But God gives grace so that we may see our own blindness, that we may walk in His merits, and show mercy even as we have received mercy. God’s kindness is meant to lead us to repentance (Romans 2:4).\n\nGod has had mercy on my Pharisee heart, and has granted to me the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ. If I understand this rightly, my heart will be truly humbled, not hypocritical. The result will be a gratitude that bears the fruit of Christ-likeness, and an openness to loving the self-righteous, even as Christ has loved me.\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Jesus said that the poor will always be among us (Mark 14:7). This means our call to make room for the poor will never expire. But as soon as we say we need to make room for the poor in our lives, we’re tempted to start drawing lines that aim to define what qualifies someone as “poor.” Do we mean a homeless person? A refugee? Someone who earns less than we do?\n\nWealth is a relative concept. Compared to some, I don’t have very much. Compared to others (to most of the people in this world, actually), I am a man of tremendous riches. I can turn on a faucet and drink the water that comes out. I can drive a mile or so from the home I was approved to purchase, in a car that I own, to a grocery store where I can fill my cart with all sorts of foods that have been prepared for me. Anyone who can do these things is, by the world’s standards, wealthy.\n\nStill, sometimes I drive past houses and cars that are nicer than mine, and I wonder what it would be like to be that rich. Wealth and poverty can make people feel worlds apart from one another. But we’re really not. In God’s economy, the wealthy are much more like the poor than they are different. No one can take anything from this life into the next, and God does not show favoritism based on how much or how little a person owns. In this sense, we are all poor in spirit.\n\n“The poor” are those who lack sufficient resources to live comfortably by the standards of their own environment. When Jesus said that we will always have the poor with us, He was referring to this world only. Paul says the same thing about material wealth. The material things we possess belong only to this life, so we dare not set our hopes on them (1 Timothy 6:17–19). Instead, we are called to make room for the poor in our lives because, materially speaking, nothing can be taken beyond the limits of this life. No one really owns anything.\n\nSo, Paul tells the wealthy not to hoard their resources, but rather to use them to do good. In fact, one of the ways we do can do good is by making room for the poor at our tables, in our budgets, and on our calendars. Scripture calls the wealthy to be generous and open-handed, ready to share. In other words, we are to use our resources as people who have the next life in view—the eternal life into which we will carry nothing except for the grace and name of Christ.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    “But we were such good friends,” my then-fiancée protested.\n\n“That was a long time ago, and we only have room for a hundred people,” I reminded her as I crossed another name from our wedding invitation list. Maybe you’ve had this experience, whether it was planning a wedding or birthday party, or sending out Christmas cards. With lists like these, it can be difficult to pick who gets to stay and who has to go. We want to make room for everyone.\n\nBut with other lists, crossing off names can come a bit more easily. Such was the case for many of the religious leaders in Jesus’s day. They knew that God had given His people a commandment to love their neighbors (Deuteronomy 19:18), and they had discovered (as we all do) that loving people can be difficult. So, they focused on the word neighbor and sought to define the term as narrowly as possible.\n\nWhen an expert in the law approached Jesus, this was precisely his angle. He wanted Jesus to define neighbor so he could walk away feeling justified (Luke 10:29). But Jesus knew following God’s Word was never supposed to be a matter of mere technical obedience. The laws in the Old Testament were meant to convict people of sin and show them a way to walk in holiness and love.\n\nTelling the parable of the good Samaritan was Jesus’s way of loving this expert in the law standing there in front of Him. This member of the religious elite had been given much, but he had missed the heart of God in His Word. The loving solution to the man’s blindness was to force him to open his eyes.\n\nA neighbor is not defined by geographic proximity, for the Samaritan and the Jewish man in Jesus’s story did not live near one another and met while both were traveling the road to Jericho. Nor can a neighbor be defined by race, for the Samaritans were a people of mixed ancestry and were despised by most Jewish people in the first century. And a neighbor cannot be defined by common beliefs, for Jews and Samaritans disagreed about fundamentals like the Scriptures and worship.\n\nJesus didn’t narrow the definition of neighbor, but expanded it to include everyone imaginable. Just as the Samaritan loved the man he found in a ditch on the side of the road simply because the man was in his path and had a need, we are called to love anyone and everyone on our path.\n\nIt sounds hard, I know. I find myself commiserating with the expert in the law. It can be overwhelming to think about all the people I am commanded to love. In those moments, I have to remember that in my lifetime I am likely to be the man in the ditch a time or two, beaten and bloodied by this world. I’ll want to be considered someone else’s neighbor when that happens. I also have to remember what is truly overwhelming: the love of Jesus, the Son of God, who willingly died for me and made me not merely His neighbor, but His family.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

That’s mine!” Toddlers think their siblings’ toys are theirs. They believe your spot on the couch is theirs. They’re convinced the satellite remote is theirs. Mine, mine, mine.\n\nFor many men, one of the common barriers to biblical hospitality is this false teaching of toddlers. God calls us to be in community with our brothers and sisters in Christ, to be hospitable to one another, and to welcome the outsider. But we look at our schedules and think, “Mine!” We struggle with making room for Christian fellowship because of busyness, hobbies, kids’ sports, and plain ol’ selfishness. Too much mineness. God has called us to more. God has empowered us for more.\n\nMaking room for others in our lives—mutually ministering to and benefitting from one another—is vital to our life in Christ. Paul tells us in Romans 12 how God has given spiritual gifts to other Christians for our benefit (vv.3–8). We benefit from the encouragement of a brother in Christ, and that brother benefits from our spiritual gifts. Growth is stifled when we stiff-arm people out of our lives. By making room for others, we welcome and cultivate shared and mutual growth.\n\nBiblical hospitality is more than a dash of manners and politeness. That sort of folksy hospitality doesn’t make the Satanic powers whimper. God is calling us toward heavenly hospitality, informed and fueled by the gospel of grace. God didn’t keep to Himself. Jesus gave His life for ours. He came to us, inviting us into His joy. He welcomes us into His kingdom, into His space. Who could have expected this kind of hospitality from God?\n\nThe gospel teaches us to make room for the unexpected. In Acts, the Jewish Christians often found it difficult to accept that God would redeem Gentiles, but God changed their hearts and minds. God welcomes and saves the unexpected.\n\nBiblical hospitality reaches beyond people who look just like you. It crosses race, income, neighborhood, politics, and preferences—just like the gospel. Where is God changing your heart and mind to make room for others? Who needs an invitation to God’s kingdom from you?\n\nWe can’t clutch our comfortable lives while following Jesus. He’s not walking toward comfort; He’s headed for the cross. Like our Shepherd, let’s make room for others in our schedules, our lives, and our hearts. We can no longer say, “Mine!” for we are His.\n\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I wasn’t married when I bought my first house, a small ranch in need of some serious renovation. And I got to work, fixing what I could and hiring help for what I couldn’t. During the remodeling, I met and fell in love with Laurin, the woman who is now my wife. That updated ranch became our first home together. It was just the two of us, and although the home would be considered cozy by most standards, it was enormous to us. We had a hard time imagining how we would fill all that space.\n\nThen we had our first son, and our home suddenly had to accommodate a nursery, then a playroom. Our spare bedroom became part-home office, part-guestroom, part-storage facility. Baby equipment began to fill our living room. Things were tight but liveable—until we found out that we were expecting again. Suddenly, the fixer-upper that seemed so enormous to me as a bachelor and a newlywed was too small for our expanding family.\n\nAs families grow, they need more space. It’s simple math. That’s what Jesus was getting at when He told His disciples, “In my Father’s house are many rooms; if not, I would have told you. I am going away to prepare a place for you” (John 14:2). Every one of Jesus’s followers will one day share a home with God. That’s how it was in the beginning for God’s children, back in Eden, and it’s how it will be again when Jesus returns. The apostle John caught a glimpse of this in the book of Revelation: “I also saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband” (Revelation 21:2). This was the “house” Jesus spoke about, where He is now preparing a place for us.\n\nIn the Jewish culture of the first century, when a man and a woman planned to get married, the bridegroom-to-be would visit the home of his beloved to arrange the marriage with the bride’s father. As our bridegroom, Jesus did this when He left heaven to come to earth. The groom would pay an agreed-upon price for his bride’s hand and then make payment. Jesus paid for His bride with His own life at Calvary. Then the bridegroom would leave the bride’s house and return to his own father’s home, where he would begin the work of constructing a new room, an addition to the house, where he and his bride will live after the betrothal period is complete. Jesus returned to heaven, to His Father, and is now preparing a place for us in His Father’s house.\n\nThis is why Jesus alone can say, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6). The only way to draw near to the Father is to be made part of the family, to be the bride of the bridegroom. Jesus did everything necessary to make this glorious happy ending a true story, including being nailed to a Roman cross for our sins. This is the good news of Easter: our sins have been paid for; injustice, pain, and death will be no more; and Jesus is preparing a forever-home for us in His Father’s house. It doesn’t get much better than that. “He who testifies about these things says, ‘Yes, I am coming soon.’ Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!” (Revelation 22:20).\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    One summer day several years back, our family went with my friend Ryan and his family to the pool. I had just finished my master’s degree, and Ryan was wrapping up his Ph.D. That’s not important except to say that we were both bookish graduate students… with the physiques to match.\n\nJust as I dipped into the pool, a young, strapping lifeguard with a barrel chest walked right up to the water’s edge. Ryan nudged me, gestured back toward the young man, and said, “That’s what I’ll look like in the resurrection.”\n\nI doubled over. I’m so grateful for witty friends.\n\nAs Christians, we have an incredible and certain hope in our returning Savior. Scripture tells us that one day, “the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the archangel’s voice, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise” (1 Thessalonians 4:16). On that day we will all be changed (1 Corinthians 15:51). The world will be renewed. And, as Ryan reminded me, we will receive new, resurrected bodies.\n\nThe false teachers Paul addresses in today’s passage may have been influenced by the pagan philosophy of dualism—a belief system that taught that material things are bad and immaterial things are good. They denied the resurrection, in part, because they despised the human body.\n\nIf we’re honest, it can be easy for us to despise our bodies as well. We only know fallen bodies—bodies that store fat in the wrong places, take work to keep in shape, and then get sore after exercise. We wrinkle and age, many of us suffering from viruses and persistent conditions like high blood pressure. And ultimately, one day our bodies will die.\n\nAs Christians, there’s no need to be jaded about our bodies. Our Lord Jesus Christ offers us hope even for the weakness and brokenness of our physical frames. He was raised from the dead on Easter Sunday, and when He returns, we will be raised like Him!\n\nFor now, our bodies break down and die. They are corruptible. But when we are raised, our bodies will no longer break down. We will be incorruptible. Now we experience shame and dishonor over the shape of our physical bodies, as well as the diseases that infect them. But when we are raised from the dead, we will be raised in power and glory (1 Corinthians 15:42–43).\n\nAnd perhaps most importantly, our bodies now are natural. Our living souls belong to Adam’s dust and this present evil age. We are sinners, and as a result, we will perish; death has a claim upon our earthly bodies. But when Christ returns and we are raised, our bodies will be made new. We will be citizens of heaven—without sin, experiencing life eternal, and living in such a way that our presence is always life-giving to others (vv. 44-49).\n\nDeath will be swallowed up with victory. Are you ready for that day? Come, Lord Jesus, and make us new!\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

This is a question I wrestle with from time to time, not because of anything I’ve read in the Bible. Rather, I have put myself in the shoes of those who have experienced some sort of personal trauma in connection with a local church. There are few wounds more damaging than those that come from someone bearing the name of Christ.\n\nWhile I empathize with anyone who carries the weight of past abuse on their back, the Christian faith rises and falls with Jesus, not with those who do evil in His name, as horrible as such a thing is. In fact, when someone has been hurt by a professing believer, I don’t think anyone feels the pain so acutely as Jesus Himself.\n\nThe Christian faith hinges on one truth—that Jesus Christ rose from the dead. The entire faith stands or falls on the location of Jesus’s body. If it’s buried in a tomb somewhere, we’re doomed. We’re stuck in our sins. We have no salvation. We are going to die, and there’s nothing after. We have no hope whatsoever (1 Corinthians 15:15–19).\n\nBut if Christ truly has risen from the dead, well, that changes everything. If Jesus is alive, our sins really are forgiven. If Jesus is alive, we don’t have to fear death, because it’s not the end for us. “Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep” (1 Corinthians 15:20). If Jesus is alive, then one day we are going to rise with Him. He has gone ahead of us, but He’s not left us. Our lives are “hidden with Christ in God,” and He is our life. When He appears, we “also will appear with Him in glory,” and we will enjoy life with Him forever (Colossians 3:3–4).\n\nIn other words, because Jesus is alive, we have a reason to hope, no matter what we may have been through.\n\nHonestly, if it weren’t for the hope that comes from Jesus’s resurrection, I don’t know what I’d do.\n\nI need this truth, and so do you—not in the abstract, but in the muck and mire of everyday life. So let’s keep holding fast to this hope, reminding ourselves and one another that the gospel is true. Because no matter the situation or circumstance, we need to press into the truth.\n\nJesus is alive. We are alive in Him. Because of Him, we have hope.\n\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    What is a mediator? In most instances, particularly legal conflicts, that term describes someone who settles disputes between two parties who cannot come an agreement. The mediator keeps the dispute neutral and serves as an acceptable negotiator and message bearer for both sides, seeking the best interests—or the best compromise—for all involved. Mediation allows disputes to be settled in a peaceful fashion at a lower cost to both sides.\n\nJesus is not this kind of mediator. He is not seeking compromise. He is not asking both sides—sinful man and holy God—to meet in the middle and give a little ground. He is not finding the best of the unsatisfactory solutions to difficult problems. He is not carrying messages from one side to the other, and then rephrasing them to be more acceptable and palatable.\n\nAnd so Jesus is an entirely different kind of mediator between God and us. This mediation is not a two-way street bringing our good to God to see what can be arranged. Jesus is the good that is brought to God. He is both mediation and mediator.\n\nHebrews 8 describes the mediating work of Christ: He “sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens” and “has now obtained a superior ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises” (vv.1,6).\n\nJesus the Mediator is not simply a negotiator on our behalf; He is the fulfillment of all we failed to be in the old covenant with God. He is the keeper of the laws we could not keep. He is the sacrifice for all the sins we have and will commit. And He lives now, at the right hand of God, as both ruler and judge, the embodiment of the new covenant of grace, and the assurance of promises to be fulfilled when He returns.\n\nWhen we fall short (daily) and break fellowship with God, we can rest in the surety that “there is one God and one mediator between God and humanity, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all” (1 Timothy 2:5–6). Our mediator is, in Himself, our innocence in the eyes of God. He goes to God—with His own work, His own perfection, His own death and resurrection—as the defense for us, the otherwise doomed.\n\nWhat greater hope could we have? If you and I were to mediate an agreement with God, it would never end in anything other than our guilt and falling short because of our sin. But Jesus did. Jesus does. So we can hope, “waiting expectantly for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for eternal life” (Jude 21), when Jesus returns, bringing glory and perfection with Him. We can rest in the knowledge that the one mediating for us can also “protect [us] from stumbling and to make [us] stand in the presence of his glory, without blemish and with great joy” (v.24). Jesus Christ is our mediator, but He is also our salvation—both today and forevermore.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

This individual would sometimes come to our home when passing through our town, and it was always a treat. In my late twenties, I reconnected with this person over a meal at a restaurant in Philadelphia. As we sat at the table together, I noticed everyone in the restaurant was looking at us and whispering. It was then I realized a certain notoriety and privilege had been given to me because of my friend’s high social status.\n\nThough it pales in comparison, I have often thought that this illustration, in some small sense, serves to highlight the great privilege believers have on account of the ascension and exaltation of Jesus to the right hand of the Father. No one has ever attained a more exalted state than that of the ascended Son of God.\n\nThe Scriptures often speak of the importance of the Son sitting at the right hand of the Father, the place of highest authority and power. In Psalm 110, the psalmist foretold the ascension of the righteous King:\n\nThis is the declaration of the LORD to my Lord: \n“Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies Your footstool (Psalm 110:1).\n\nHere, God the Father is speaking to God the Son about the culmination of His redeeming work, the crowing of His redemptive accomplishments on behalf of His people. And as the resurrected and incarnate God-man, the Son received from the Father all authority in heaven and on earth when He ascended on high (Matthew 28:18).\n\nRight now, Jesus—who walked this earth as both fully man and fully God—sits on the throne of God as the righteous King of all the earth. The One who shared in our humanity now represents us as our King. Unlike the privilege I experienced by virtue of our family friend’s social status, everything that Jesus has received in the ascension has become ours as well. He sends the Spirit, subdues all of our enemies, and has secured the ultimate victory over death. Jesus has received from His Father the everlasting inheritance, one that becomes fully ours by virtue of our union with Him.\n\nAmong the kings of Israel, none was so revered and exalted as David. However, Peter explained that there is a King who has done something that David never did—He ascended on high in order to pour out the promised Spirit on His people (Acts 2:32–34). The ascended Christ has secured and distributed the greatest blessings that anyone could ever receive in this world. As we consider this truth, may our hearts be overwhelmed with gratitude for the everlasting privileges we have through Jesus Christ, our righteous and eternal King, who sits on the very throne of God.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

There are numerous examples of God’s Spirit empowering individuals for service in the Old Testament. However, Jesus spoke of something new that would take place after His ascension.\n\nBy His death on the cross, Jesus purified all those who would believe in Him. The Holy Spirit can now dwell within believers, just as God’s presence once dwelled within the temple in Jerusalem. The Spirit empowers God’s people to be fruitful witnesses to Him as the gospel is taken to all the nations. This explains why Jesus told His disciples just before His ascension to the Father’s right hand, “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come on you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” (Acts 1:8).\n\nJesus Christ has ascended to the right hand of the Father and is now reigning. He has been given the nations as an inheritance, and He has tasked us with helping to bring those nations home. But He goes with us—through the Holy Spirit. That is why He could say to His disciples, “I am with you always, to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:20). Jesus and the Spirit are one, just as Jesus and the Father are one. With the Holy Spirit inside of us, we take Christ with us, and He works through us, everywhere we go. The Spirit is a taste of the glory we will receive when Jesus returns: “The Holy Spirit is the down payment of our inheritance, until the redemption of the possession, to the praise of his glory” (Ephesians 1:14).\n\nThe ascension was never really goodbye. Jesus returned to the Father, so that through His Spirit we might be His witnesses. He has granted this privilege to all who believe in Him. The gift of the Holy Spirit is one of the greatest blessings of His ascension as we wait for His return.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

In order to fulfill this command, we must call people to respond to Christ. But we’ve misunderstood the Great Commission if we only think about it as something we’re commanded to do. The truth is that God’s mission didn’t begin in Matthew 28. God Himself was on mission long before it was an activity for Christians or a line item in the church budget.\n\nAs theologian R. Paul Stevens says, “Mission is God’s own going forth…. He is Sender, Sent, and Sending.” The Father sent the Son (John 3:16–17; 5:36); the Father and Son send the Holy Spirit (John 14:26; 15:26); and now we are sent into the world (John 20:21; Acts 1:8). God’s mission is from the Father, through the Son, and by the Holy Spirit. The passages we’re reading today make this clear.\n\nIn Daniel 7, the Son of Man received the mission from the Father. Daniel sees the Savior ride on the clouds of heaven before His Father, the Ancient of Days. Then the Son of Man is given dominion, glory, and a kingdom so that every people, nation, and language should serve him (v.14).\n\nIn 2 Corinthians, Paul writes to tell us that our message and ministry of reconciliation is rooted in what God has already accomplished through Christ. “In Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting [the world’s] trespasses against them” (5:19). As we experience His work of redemption, we’re changed and transformed into Christ’s ambassadors.\n\nFinally, in the Great Commission, Jesus reminds us that the mission is empowered by the Holy Spirit. We’re commanded to go and make disciples by teaching and baptizing. But as we go, He goes too. He is “with [us] always, to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:20).\n\nWill you join God on His mission today? Consider these questions based on the missionary activity of the Trinity:\n\nFather, what are You planning for me in Your world?\nAm I eager to join You?\nJesus, what have You accomplished in me?\nAm I experiencing Your reconciliation and renewal?\nSpirit, where are You calling me to go?\nAm I willing to step out in faith?\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Before I was a Christian, I had a tendency to shoot my mouth off. As a new Christian, I still did this, but I did it while wielding what my wife and I affectionately called my “mighty theological hammer of justice.” I was the “Well, actually” guy of “Well, actually” guys. I’m not proud of it, but it’s true. Now, as a slightly less new believer, well… I think I’m getting better at this. Maybe. Hopefully.\n\nWhen I think back on past conversations (or replay some more recent conversations), I think about the foolish things I’ve said to people when the “Well, actually” guy made a guest appearance. Maybe I didn’t state something quite the way I’d intended. Maybe I was too harsh, too arrogant, or just plain ignorant. To this day, I get anxious being in the same room with certain people, even after asking their forgiveness for the things I’ve said. Forgiveness has been extended, but the sting of guilt remains.\n\nAll this is to say, I get Peter. Or at least young Peter. He was a bit too sure of himself. The patron saint of “Well, actually” guys, Peter even went so far as to patiently explain to Jesus Himself why He was wrong—on more than one occasion—only to be proven wrong each time. But that last time, when he swore he would not deny Jesus, only to deny Him three times… I have a hard time imagining him not tearing himself apart in the hours and days that followed his betrayal of Jesus. Scripture says Peter “wept bitterly” (Luke 22:62), but I have a feeling that might be an understatement.\n\nIt’s easy to look down on Peter because of his brashness, but his story is good news for people like me. Through Peter, I get to see the depths of Jesus’s love, not just for Peter, but for me too. Think about it: In the garden before His arrest, Jesus said to Peter, “I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And you, when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers” (Luke 22:32). Jesus knew Peter’s faith would fall short, yet He was already preparing his disciple to move past it.\n\nAfter His resurrection, Jesus pursued Peter to restore him. He even made Peter breakfast, while asking three times, “Do you love me?” Each time Peter answered “yes,” and each time Jesus told him to do one thing: care for His sheep, feed them (John 21:15–17). Jesus restored and transformed Peter into a shepherd. He removed Peter’s shame, and affirmed his purpose.\n\nThat’s good news, isn’t it?\n\nWhen I consider Peter’s story, I see my own sin. But his journey also helps me to remember that I don’t need to wallow in shame. Jesus offers restoration to all of us “Well, actually” guys.\n\nHe gives all we need for life and godliness as we grow in our knowledge of Him (2 Peter 1:3). He affirms our purpose and points us toward the mission of making disciples. We’re called to build one another up, to supplement our faith with “goodness, goodness with knowledge, knowledge with self-control, self-control with endurance, endurance with godliness, godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love “ (1:5–7). In all these things, I have every hope that Christ will bear much fruit in our lives to the glory of God.\n\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    When I read about the two disciples on the road to Emmaus and how Jesus, “beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, … interpreted for them the things concerning himself in all the Scriptures,” I get jealous (Luke 24:27). Imagine getting to learn directly from Jesus as He taught through the Old Testament!\n\nOf course, at this point in the story, the two disciples haven’t yet recognized Jesus for who He is. They considered him just another traveler on the highway, who happened to know an awful lot about Scripture. This apparent stranger was able to join together threads from across the Old Testament—Genesis and Jeremiah, Psalms and Samuel—to weave a picture of Jesus they hadn’t seen before. And this wasn’t the only time Jesus had to give this sort of teaching to show His disciples how all the pieces fit together. Later in the same chapter, Jesus appeared to the Eleven and others, and “he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures” (v. 45).\n\nFrom the beginning, God’s plan had been to send His Son to die in our place, and in the resurrection, to defeat death. The Messiah was always going to take up our sins and defeat the powers of darkness. It was all there in the Scriptures—but it’s really, really hard to see.\n\nThink about it for a moment. Can you name a single passage that talks about God’s Son being born of a woman, living as a man, then dying on a cross, only to rise again on the third day? There are promises of a Deliverer, and assurances that one day God Himself would reign as king. There’s even a description of a suffering Servant (Isaiah 53), but nowhere is He directly identified with God’s Son or the Messiah. All the pieces of the puzzle are there in different passages spread across the Old Testament, but we could never have put them together without Jesus’s help and the benefit of hindsight.\n\nPaul, a man who was trained as a rabbi and a Pharisee, could not see how the Old Testament pointed to Jesus until he met Jesus on the road to Damascus. Then, as an apostle, he wrote of the “wisdom” of the crucifixion, saying, “None of the rulers of this age knew this wisdom, because if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory” (1 Corinthians 2:8).\n\nTake a moment to marvel at God’s brilliance. The death and resurrection of Jesus are proclaimed throughout the Old Testament, but never so clearly that Satan and the powers of darkness could see it. (“The rulers of this age” is a term Paul often used to describe spiritual forces of evil; see Ephesians 6:12.) Otherwise, they would have recognized the cross not as the apparent key to their victory but as the moment of their defeat. But now, as the gospel goes forth, we can see that Jesus’s sacrifice and His defeat of death was God’s plan all along—and we can proclaim along with the Emmaus road disciples, “The Lord has truly been raised” (Luke 24:34).\n\nYou and I can study the Bible for a lifetime, and we will never complete our task. There will still be more to learn about God and what He’s done. Lots more. We can stand on the shoulders of theological giants, linguistic experts, and literary masterminds, and we still won’t exhaust all that the Bible has to say to us. Because of God’s infinite wisdom, His Word is a bottomless pool of riches for you and I to swim around in like we’re Scrooge McDuck. And someday, when this age has come to an end, we’ll get to walk and talk with the risen Christ ourselves, just like those disciples on the Emmaus road. I can’t wait.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    When my grandfather passed away shortly before my ninth birthday I knew, even at that young age, I would not see him again. I knew what death meant, that when someone dies we don’t see them again in this life. I was certain that my grandpa would never take me for another tractor ride or teach me to ride a horse or catch a catfish again. He was gone from my life.\n\nPut yourself in the place of the disciples after Jesus was crucified. The one they had placed their hopes in was dead. Now imagine that a friend, Mary Magdalene, appears and says that the tomb is empty and they’ve taken Jesus away. If you’re like me, your first thought probably wouldn’t be, He’s alive! It would most likely be, Who took Him? What have they done with Him? Where is He?\n\nThis is how we find Peter and John, with Mary, as they race to Jesus’s gravesite. They arrive to witness an empty tomb and folded burial cloths. Peter was slow to recognize what this meant, but John believed and recalled Jesus’s words that He must die and be raised from the dead (Luke 9:22–24).\n\nMary could not reconcile what she saw—an empty tomb—with what she knew of death. So as odd as it seems, of course she did not recognize Jesus when He approached her. Of course she pleaded with this seeming stranger to show where the body was. There was no way a dead man could be speaking with her. It was only when Jesus said her name that she knew Him. (And isn’t that how Jesus calls us out of darkness, too—gently and by name?)\n\nAt Jesus’s prompting, Mary returned to the rest of the disciples and announced “I have seen the Lord!” (John 20:18). Paired with what John and Peter had told them, belief began to take root; their Lord who was dead was… alive. Everyone believed, except Thomas. He could not see how death could be temporary. He could not reconcile the sight of Jesus’s body, cold and lifeless and laid in a tomb, with the idea of Him being very much alive again. And so Thomas insisted (in great agony of soul, I am sure) that he must see for himself the nail-scarred hands and spear-torn side of Jesus in order to believe.\n\nIn His kindness, Jesus gave Thomas what he needed. He appeared to the disciples and showed His pierced hands to Thomas, inviting him to place a hand on His scars. But Jesus made a point to bless all those who believed without seeing. Years later Peter would hearken back to this in his first epistle: “Though you have not seen him, you love him; though not seeing him now, you believe in him, and you rejoice with inexpressible and glorious joy” (1 Peter 1:8).\n\nThis is us, anyone who follows Jesus today. We do not need to see His nail-scarred hands to know they were nailed to a cross for our sins. By faith, we rest in the work of Jesus on the cross and believe the promises He’s made to us through Scripture.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

At the moment when the Son of God cried out on the cross, “My God, my God, why have You abandoned me?” the sun was darkened and the earth quaked (Matthew 27:45–46,50–51). These natural signs symbolized something of the spiritual realities that were occurring at the crucifixion of Christ. In the Old Testament, darkness denoted the wrath and curse of God. When God was in the process of delivering Israel from bondage in Egypt He sent “darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness that [could] be felt” (Exodus 10:21). Similarly, when God foretold the covenant curses that would come upon His people if they rejected Him, He promised “that at noon [they would] grope as a blind person gropes in the dark” (Deuteronomy 28:29). And Jesus Himself spoke of hell as “outer darkness” (Matthew 8:12; 22:13).\n\nWhen He hung on the cross, He did so in the place of condemned sinners, bearing the wrath of God in order to redeem and deliver those for whom He died. Many had hung on a cross before Him, dying a cursed death, but none had endured the cross like Jesus had. “He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth. Like a lamb led to the slaughter and like a sheep silent before her shearers, he did not open his mouth” (Isaiah 53:7).\n\nIt is a well attested fact that many who died by crucifixion hurled insults at passersby and at one another. The Gospel records tell us that even those who were crucified with Jesus reviled Him from their place of condemnation (Matthew 27:44). After witnessing Jesus’s actions, it became evident to those standing at the foot of the cross that He was no mere man suffering. The centurion and those who kept watch over Jesus cried out, “Truly this man was the Son of God” (v.54). The divine nature of Jesus shone forth in the darkness of the natural surroundings, leading those who witnessed this cosmic event to see Him for who He truly is.\n\nThe darkening of the sun, the earthquake, the veil of the temple being torn in two from top to bottom, the Son’s crying out—each of these events points to the greater significance of what Jesus endured on the cross. As we meditate on what Jesus Christ has done for us, let us acknowledge that He truly is the Son of God, our Creator who took on flesh to suffer in our place and for our sin.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

In Hebrew, it’s Yeshua, a shortened form of Yehoshua, or Joshua—and it was a popular choice in the first century. Archaeologists have uncovered numerous grave markings from the period etched with the name, attesting to its popularity.\n\nThough we’re used to thinking of the name Jesus belonging solely to the one and only Son of God, it’s likely that Jesus knew plenty of other Jesuses in His day. This is somewhat fitting, because today we have lots of Jesuses too. We tend to fashion our personal image of Jesus into someone who’s passionate about whatever it is we’re passionate about. Whatever our political or theological leanings, our default setting is to believe that Jesus is on our side, rather than wondering if we’re on His. That’s why God has given us the Bible: so that we might know the real Jesus and, over time, become more like Him, rather than attempting to make Him more like us.\n\nWhen Pontius Pilate examined Jesus, he wanted the Man standing before him to proclaim His innocence. He listened for something that would give him an out, a reason to free Jesus and send the Jewish authorities away without disturbing the fragile peace of Jerusalem. Herod Antipas considered the prisoner and grew frustrated when Jesus didn’t turn out to be a showman who would perform miracles for his amusement.\n\nThe crowds shouting, “Crucify him!” wanted a Jesus that was more to their liking as well. Pilate, taking advantage of a Passover tradition, offered to pardon one of the two prisoners he was holding under guard that morning: “Who is it you want me to release for you—Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” (Matthew 27:17). If you scan down to the bottom of the page in your Bible, you’ll likely find a footnote. Some ancient manuscripts of Matthew’s Gospel include Barabbas’s full name as “Jesus Barabbas.” In other words, Pilate presented two prisoners named Jesus to the angry mob—Jesus who is called Barabbas and Jesus who is called Christ. The choice was theirs.\n\nJesus who is called Barabbas had been involved in an insurrection, a violent uprising against Rome. Jesus who is called Christ had instructed His followers to love their enemies (Matthew 5:44). Barabbas had committed murdered and was guilty of the charges he faced (Mark 15:7). Jesus came to lay down His life and was innocent of every accusation leveled against Him. Yet the crowds wanted Barabbas and chose to set him free. They preferred a Jesus who fought with weapons they understood.\n\nMay we never choose the Jesus who fits our prejudices and preferences, the Jesus we can easily understand because he’s just like us. The real Jesus isn’t like us, yet He became one of us so that we might become like Him—and to prove the truth of His name, Yahweh saves!\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

Every single time. Go back and watch one of them after you’re done reading this, and you’ll see I’m right. And almost every time, that betrayal comes from someone close, from a friend.\n\nOn the night He was arrested, Jesus was intimately familiar with the sting of betrayal. That betrayal came from all of His friends—every single one—but only one of them intended it. Think about Peter that night. He was being peak-level Peter: overly confident and impulsive with a mouth that, at times, is faster than his brain (all that to say, I get him). Jesus said to the disciples, “Tonight all of you will fall away because of me” (Matthew 26:31), but Peter was having none of it. Instead, he bloviated about his enduring commitment, promising, “Even if everyone falls away because of you, I will never fall away” (v.35).\n\nI love that Jesus knew Peter’s heart better than Peter did in this moment, yet He still spoke a humbling truth to His disciple—even if Peter wasn’t yet ready to hear it. “‘Truly I tell you,’ Jesus said to him, ‘tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times’” (v.34). But Peter was sure that Jesus was wrong about this… and then he fell asleep after Jesus asked him to pray.\n\nThe other disciples, James and John included, were no better. All of them failed Jesus that night. But the worst was Judas Iscariot. He was the one at the front of the line, the one who led a mob into the garden of Gethsemane, walked right up to Jesus, and kissed Him—an act normally reserved for intimate friendship. “‘Friend,’ Jesus asked him, ‘why have you come?’” (v.50). Jesus was calling Judas back to his senses, to see what he was doing as the evil thing it was, even if Judas wouldn’t realize it until it was too late.\n\nBut God was already prepared for betrayal. In fact, the disciples’ betrayal was part of His plan from the beginning. Peter denied Jesus, despite his bold protestations to the contrary. It is no wonder he wept bitterly (Luke 22:60–62). But his denial led to something beautiful: a painful awareness of his own sinfulness and need for salvation.\n\nJesus was taken away, like a “lamb led to the slaughter and like a sheep silent before her shearers, he did not open his mouth” (Isaiah 53:7). He was beaten and spat upon, mocked and jeered, but He endured it all because there was a greater purpose (Hebrews 12:2). God’s plan was going to be fulfilled. The Lamb of God was going to take away the sins of the world, and in the end, all will see “the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven” (Matthew 26:64).\n\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong\n\n                ",

Each episode would investigate all of the terrible professions no one wants—jobs like camel milker or owl-vomit collector. Seriously. The show described one job as “worse than vomit”: making jelly beans that smell like feet!\n\nIn John chapter 13, Jesus taught us that servant leaders aren’t afraid to get dirty. After eating dinner with His disciples, Jesus took a towel and a bowl and then knelt down to wash his friends’ feet. And people’s feet were really dirty in those days. Think about it. There were very few paved roads, lots of animals around, and everyone walked everywhere. Washing dirty, stinky feet was the kind of job reserved only for the lowly.\n\nBut Jesus embraced it.\n\nAnd when He had finished washing His disciples’ feet, He put His robe back on and asked the men, “Do you know what I have done for you?” (v.12). They must have been silent, because our Savior immediately explained, “You call me Teacher and Lord—and you are speaking rightly since that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you ought also to wash one another’s feet” (vv.13–14). Jesus didn’t just teach His disciples; He gave them a model of servant leadership, from which we can observe at least two things.\n\nFirst, servant leaders need Jesus. We cannot serve others until we see that Jesus first served us. We need our Savior to wash us and cleanse us from our rebellion and brokenness. Jesus didn’t just show us how to do the dirty work. He demonstrated His love for us by laying down His life for our sake; “having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end” (v.1). Now, He gives us His Spirit, who makes us able to serve others and love them, even when it’s intensely difficult.\n\nSecond, we see that servant leaders must follow Jesus’s example by embracing dirty jobs. Don’t tell your friends, spouse, or kids, “I’m a servant leader!” if you aren’t willing to do difficult things. Jesus laid down His life for us, an unimaginable sacrifice. Now He calls us to sacrifice for others too. God may not ask you to milk camels or collect owl vomit, but He does ask you to do hard things every day—things like standing up for the fair treatment of the vulnerable and oppressed; setting aside your own needs at the end of a long day to serve your wife; or silencing your fear of rejection to share your faith with a friend. That’s practical servant leadership, and it’s the way of our Servant Savior.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

Early in his career LeBron James was “anointed” the next Michael Jordan. At the beginning of most football seasons for the past decade, the Alabama Crimson Tide were “anointed” national champions. We don’t anoint those who have achieved the throne; we anoint those we think will. It is a trite, metaphorical use of a word that was once loaded with profound meaning.\n\nIn biblical times, the anointed was the chosen one, the one set aside to reign. It was not a prediction but a dedication to the path of kingship. It predicated rule and stateliness, and the anointed one was seen as set apart, different. Anointing was tied to coronation in the eyes of God and people.\n\nReaders of the Gospels will see a pattern: Jesus doesn’t operate like any other king in history. From His birth to His upbringing to His followers to His message—Jesus was a different kind of king. In Matthew 21 we see Jesus entering the temple and driving out the sellers and moneychangers to purify His Father’s house as “a house of prayer” (v.13). The blind and the lame, outcasts of society, flocked to Him for healing, and the little children shouted, “Hosanna to the Son of David!”—despite the sneers of religious and societal leaders. Jesus’s home was a place of prayer, His court was filled with forgotten and downtrodden people, and His loyal followers included little children.\n\nJesus was not anointed in a grand ceremony or by a powerful representative of God or government. His anointing came at the hands of a humble woman as He dined with a man known as a leper, a truly unclean label in Jewish society. She broke open a jar of alabaster and poured pure nard on Jesus’s head as He reclined at a table. She gave her best to Him, a perfume fit for royalty but also used for embalming bodies.\n\nThe woman in this story goes unnamed by Mark but is identified as Mary, the sister of Lazarus, in John 12:1–7. A friend of Jesus, she anointed Him as king and prepared Him for burial. Jesus honored Mary for her actions, declaring, “She has done what she could; she has anointed my body in advance for burial. Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her” (Mark 14:8–9). Mary recognized that Jesus was not just a good Jewish man, a good prophet, or a good teacher. She anointed Him as the giver of life and the King of kings. And she anointed Him before His death because that is how His victory would be won.\n\nKing Jesus held court with children and lepers, kept company with the blind and the lame, gave women the respect and dignity society denied them, and acted like no other ruler. It is a good thing too. Every other ruler anointed to kingship, no matter how upright and good, has failed and died. Jesus, anointed to rule and die, is the giver of eternal life and salvation.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

Is there anything more uncomfortable than people looking only at you while they sing “Happy Birthday”? I don’t like the attention. And should it happen in public at a restaurant, you can help yourself to the rest of my (former) friends. \n\nDid you notice today, on Palm Sunday, how Jesus doesn’t deflect from receiving people’s praise? All throughout the Gospels, Jesus is constantly saying, “Don’t tell anyone what I did for you just yet.” Jesus doesn’t crave the hype machine people want to crank up when He’s around—except here. \n\nOn Palm Sunday, as Jesus rides an unflashy donkey into town, He doesn’t redirect all the attention He’s getting. The scene is unignorable. The crowd is raucous; they are tossing clothes on the street. Jesus is receiving total and undeniable adoration. In chapter 19, Luke tells us they are praising loudly and joyfully (v. 37). And of course, the Pharisees are there, trying to squelch the joy. They tell Jesus to put a muzzle on all the craze—the singing, the volume, the palm branches—they want it gone. The Pharisees want Jesus to be ignorable. But Jesus disagrees. \n\nThe Lord on the donkey says He won’t tell His disciples to stop singing. And even if He did, the stones they are standing on would form a choir (v. 40). The Pharisees are uncomfortable with everything going on, but Jesus, as the center of attention, isn’t uncomfortable at all. The praise is right. It’s holy. It’s exactly what should be happening. Why? Because Jesus is the King who comes in the name of the Lord. Jesus is the Messiah the people of God have waited for since the promise in Eden (Genesis 3:14-15). Jesus is the King, from David’s line, who will reign and rule forever. \n\nJesus bears the very name of God, and came to rescue His people from their slavery to sin and death. He came to die for us, to pay for our sins. He rose from the grave to give us new life. Is this your song, too? Today, by faith, do you share in the song, proclaiming Him as Messiah? Do you join the crowd in singing the praises of your King? Let us rejoice! Let us praise our King in a way that cannot be ignored.\n\nWritten by Jeff Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    In the Old Testament, God placed David as His king over His people. David was, as the rest of Scripture reveals, a type of Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords. In the Davidic covenant God promised He would set one of David’s sons on the throne and over the kingdom forever. The promise of a “forever” King is fulfilled in Jesus, the Son of God and the son of David.\n\nThe great requirement of the kings who ruled the monarchy in Israel was that whoever ascended to the throne was supposed to rule in righteousness according to the Word of God. The long, sad story of the old covenant people of God is that they had a litany of kings who ruled in unrighteousness. In the line of kings were men who practiced and promoted wickedness before the people of God. Very early in the history of the monarchy, the kingdom split in two. Both Israel and Judah had kings who practiced and promoted extreme evil among the people.\n\nThese unrighteous kings practiced divination, set up high places for the worship of other gods, and led the people into the practices of the pagan nations around them. Throughout Israel’s history, there was no righteous king who could change the hearts of the people and lead them into the pure worship of God.\n\nBut the Lord made this promise to King David: “I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever” (2 Samuel 7:13). One day, God would place a righteous king over His people, uniting them through His righteous rule. Jesus came into the world, and it was evident that He is the righteous King Israel needed.\n\nScripture tells us Pontius Pilate “also had a sign made and put on [that] cross. It said: JESUS OF NAZARETH, the KING of the JEWS” (John 19:19), written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. Through a simple sign, God was superintending that title, intimating that Jesus, the righteous King of the true Israel, had come to establish His rule among His people from every nation, tribe, people, and tongue (Revelation 7:9). He is “the true one, the one who has the key of David, who opens and no one will close, and who closes and no one opens” (3:7).\n\nJesus has power over sin and death and all unrighteousness. He lived a perfectly sinless life and died an atoning death to establish His rule in the hearts of all those who trust Him. No longer slaves to our flesh, now those of us who put our hope in Him can live our lives freely, under the rule of the righteous King of kings and Lord of lords.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    When we read the Old Testament, we’re often looking for heroes, role models, and examples to follow. No doubt there are heroic characters and stories of faithfulness worthy of emulation, but most of what we see is failure and need. The Bible isn’t a book primarily about human success and glorification; it is a book about God’s perfection and glory expressed toward, and shared with, humans who can’t get their act together.\n\nIn Exodus 32 we encounter the story of the golden calf. While Moses was in God’s very presence on Mount Sinai receiving the Ten Commandments, the people of Israel were growing impatient; they demanded that Aaron, God’s appointed high priest, build them an idol to worship, a golden calf cast from their own donated jewelry. The irony and tragedy of this is palpable.\n\nGod’s response to the people of Israel was wrath; He was finished with their rebellion and rejection of Him. He had called them from nowhere, turned them into a nation, rescued them from slavery, and this was how they responded? Israel was doomed because of their sin until Moses intervened. He “sought the favor of the LORD his God” and pleaded on behalf of the people (vv.11–14). He asked for mercy and appealed to God’s promises and covenant. And the text tells us that God relented of His wrath, and the people were free to continue toward the Promised Land.\n\nIf you read that account carefully you will see how we ought to read the Old Testament, not as a collection of hero stories but as a narrative pointing forward to Jesus. In the sin of Israel, blatant rebellion in the face of God’s kindness and in the presence of His glory, we should see ourselves. We sin, just as they did. And in the intercession of Moses on behalf of the people we see someone seeking to make things right with God, to be a go-between, a mediator. And like Jesus, Moses was rejected by the people, pushed to the side, as Stephen preached in Acts 7.\n\nBut like every other person who foreshadows Jesus in the Old Testament, Moses’s mediation failed. He was a God-given leader, but he was not a perfect mediator between God and man. He was the man God chose, but not the God-Man who would ultimately save. Only Jesus Christ is worthy to be the mediator humanity needs to assuage the wrath of God.\n\nIn Christ, we have a new covenant unlike the covenant of the Old Testament (Jeremiah 31:32). God Himself will write this covenant on the hearts of His people, and He will “forgive their iniquity and never again remember their sin” (vv.33–34). Through the mediation of Moses, the people survived the wilderness and entered Canaan. Through the mediation of Jesus, all who trust in Him have complete forgiveness and eternal life, despite their own rebellion and rejection of God.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    For years, I struggled with what to do with Genesis 22. The first time I heard anyone attempt to teach on it, it didn’t really make sense, largely because it was being taught from a “go and do likewise” point-of-view. But the problem, at least as I saw it, was that there wasn’t a specific me-oriented action to take. At least, not in the way we normally think. Instead, as I read the story, I kept coming back to one question: Why?\n\nWhy was God asking Abraham to take Isaac—his only son, whom he loved—to a mountain where the father was to sacrifice the son? (v.2). Why was the child of promise, the one through whom all Abraham’s descendants would be traced (Hebrews 11:18) and all nations blessed, to be killed? Why would Isaac go with his father when he asked, “Where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” (Genesis 22:7). Why was Abraham sure that “God himself [would] provide the lamb for the burnt offering”? (v.8). Why was Abraham so sure that both he and Isaac would return from the mountain? (v.5).\n\nThere’s really only one answer to these questions: Abraham believed God “to be able even to raise someone from the dead” (Hebrews 11:19). This is the only explanation that makes sense of the scene Abraham and Isaac found themselves in—the hope of resurrection. So when Abraham said that he and his son would return from the mountain, when he tied up his son and raised the knife high over him, it was all because he believed God would raise Isaac from the dead. When the angel stopped Abraham and God provided a substitute for Isaac (Genesis 22:13), there was still a sense in which Isaac had been raised from the dead, if only figuratively.\n\nBut God doesn’t want us just believing and hoping in a figurative resurrection, because there is nothing figurative about what awaits those who trust in Christ. There is a day coming when those “who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake” (Daniel 12:2) because God provided a lamb—the Lamb—for the sacrifice, when He sent His Son Jesus into the world.\n\nThat’s the only thing that makes Genesis 22 make sense to me. It’s not telling me to have faith like Abraham or to be obedient like Isaac or any other forced application I could make when focusing on my own actions. Instead, the only action we can take is to put our hope in the resurrection. God is able to raise the dead, and He did just that when Jesus stepped from the grave. He continues to raise people from the dead—you, me, and all who trust in Jesus. And someday, when all things are made new, He will raise all who believe to eternal life, and they “will shine like the bright expanse of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever” (Daniel 12:3).\n\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    God is holy. He’s wholly separate from sin. So in the time of Noah, when God saw that “every inclination of the human mind was nothing but evil all the time” (Genesis 6:5), He decided to end the wickedness and corruption, to put an end to every creature (v.13). Flood waters came as His judgment. No creature would have survived on the earth had God not looked favorably upon Noah and instructed him to build an ark of safety (vv.8,14–16).\n\nOur world remains just as broken today. Human hearts are still inclined toward selfishness, greed, and abuse of power. My own heart is still inclined toward evil, and yours is too. Sometimes our emotions feel like an overwhelming flood to us. And at other times, we’re prone to harden our hearts to pain, so that the brokenness doesn’t feel as overwhelming as it actually is.\n\nThe first section of Wendell Berry’s novel Jayber Crow concludes with Jayber walking back to his hometown in a thunderstorm. Between the man and his home in Port William, Kentucky, is the St. Clair Street Bridge in Frankfort. Jayber arrives there just as the Kentucky River begins to pour over its banks. The bridge is closed because of the flood, but in spite of the barricades, Jayber slips past a policeman and crosses, unrelenting in his homeward journey. As he moves over the bridge, Jayber looks out over the water and feels the weight of the destruction:\n\nEverything came turning in the currents, into sight and then out of sight almost faster than I could believe. Along what had been the shores I could see the trees shaking and battering their limbs together. And the waves and swirls of the water caught the human lights of the town and flung them hither and yon. And this is what it was like—the words were just right there in my mind, and I knew they were true: “the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.”\n\nStanding in the midst of the flood waters, Jayber remembered God’s Spirit. Instead of judgment, the storm and flood now marked a new creation for him—the end of his old life and the start of something new.\n\nThis passage reminds me of God’s faithfulness to make a way through our flood. Though our need is just as dire as in Noah’s time, God’s promise remains (Genesis 8:21). Though our sins still deserve the harshest judgment, God has provided an ark of safety in Christ Jesus. Just as God swore to Noah that He would never again flood the earth, He has sworn to remove His anger from us. Our Savior’s love and compassion are everlasting; His covenant of peace will not be shaken (Isaiah 54:8–10). We can trust Him to bring us through the flood and make all things new.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    A few weeks ago, my brother James texted me a photo of the house we grew up in. I hadn’t seen the place in years, having moved about a thousand miles south. The home looked terrible. A paint job was long overdue, siding was falling off, and several obvious repairs were needed—and that’s just what I could see from the outside.\n\nIn practical terms, the house is just a building, a late 1970s colonial prone to decay and corruption. Every home I’ve had is like this. Of course, not every house is falling apart. Some have been kept, improved, even expanded. Others have stayed pretty much the same over the years. A few, like this house I knew as a teenager, have seen better days. But all of them are temporary. Each one is slowly declining, as time and the elements do their thing.\n\nThe early chapters of Genesis are a reminder that the situation wasn’t always this way. We were made for a permanent home—one that never breaks down, falls apart, or withers away. Humanity’s first home was with God in Eden. In a tragic turn, Adam and Eve disobeyed God and found themselves feeling the early stages of decay and corruption. Along with our first parents, we were banished from the garden.\n\nThe rest of the Bible tells the story of our misguided attempts to get back to Eden on our own terms, while God patiently makes a way for us to return on His. And this, of course, is why Jesus came. He made a home on earth so that we might someday make our home once again in Paradise with God. It is no coincidence that the Bible is bookended by two gardens—Eden in Genesis and New Jerusalem, a garden city, in Revelation.\n\nOur longing for home goes beyond a desire for different geography. It surfaces every time we sin. We feel the sting of disobedience, the way Adam and Eve did. Genesis tells us, “they knew they were naked” and covered themselves (3:7). No matter how many fig leaves they could have collected, it would never have been enough, so naturally, they hid when they heard God coming their way. Our sin leaves us feeling exposed as well, and filthy. In Psalm 51, King David says what we all feel after we taste the remorse of our sin:\n\nCompletely wash away my guilt\nand cleanse me from my sin….\nPurify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; \nwash me and I will be whiter than snow (vv.2,7).\n\nThe only way to be made clean again is through divine intervention. Though our hearts might prompt us to hide as Adam and Eve did, it’s the wrong move. We need the touch of our heavenly Father, closeness with God rather than isolation from Him. We cannot, and will not, do that on our own, so Jesus came to us with the Father’s love.\n\nIn Psalm 16, David says to God, “In your presence is abundant joy; at your right hand are eternal pleasures” (v.11). God’s presence—it’s our home, it’s what we were made for, and thanks be to Jesus, it’s our destiny.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Remember and proclaim.\n\nThroughout Scripture, we are instructed to recall the ways God has acted on our behalf, and to share those stories of triumph and truth with others, with the next generation of believers (Psalm 145:4). The Israelites’ exodus out of slavery from Egypt? Remember and proclaim (Psalm 105:1–5). The taking of the eucharist? An act of remembering Christ’s life, death, and resurrection—all on our behalf—and proclaiming the infinite gift and power in them for those who believe in the risen Jesus (1 Corinthians 11:23–26).\n\nSo it is in today’s reading of Psalm 145, “a hymn of praise,” attributed to King David, who determines to “exalt, “bless,” and “praise [God’s] name forever and ever” (vv.1–2). Not only will he declare God’s praises, but from one generation to the next, God’s works and acts, His character, power, and righteousness, will be declared (vv.3–5). But in order for that to happen, God’s “awe-inspiring acts” and faithful love must first be remembered.\n\nThere is power in saying something out loud, in speaking truth to ourselves and to one another. Researchers in the worlds of education and psychology call this “the production effect.” Studies have shown that memory is improved by literally speaking aloud what we’re reading, thinking, and studying. The actual retrieval and recall of both past and new experiences, and the relaying of them to someone else further works to etch our experiences and knowledge into our minds. In short, if you really want to remember something, tell someone else about it. It’s incredible to think that God would design us this way, to further draw us into community to speak truth to one another (Ephesians 5:19–20).\n\nThe Hebrew word for “remember” is zakar, and it encompasses more than simply “thinking” or knowledge—it implies action. And in Hebrew tradition, practicing faith in present circumstances and exhibiting hope for the future requires that you remember God’s faithfulness in the past. What better way to remind ourselves of God’s power and steadfast love than to share our experiences with God with someone else? In looking back at God’s “great goodness and righteousness” in our own lives and in the lives of those we read about in Scripture, we are reminded that He provides what we need “at the proper time” and “[satisfies] the desire of every living thing” (vv.15–16).\n\nVerse 20 tells us when we call out to God, He is near. However, His nearness is in no way dependent upon our crying out to Him. No, He is always near, always present. When we draw near to Him, He draws near to us (James 4:8). He does not need an invitation to come to us, but in our calling out to Him, we remember that He is, in fact, a very real and present help (Psalm 46:1). Our mighty, compassionate God is delighted to be in our midst now and always (Zephaniah 3:17; Matthew 28:20). Sometimes we forget this truth, and sometimes we struggle to believe it’s true. Either way, God does not change.\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    On Saturday afternoons in autumn, one of my favorite things to do is find a hearty stew recipe, throw open the windows, and stream a great playlist of folk music. I once heard someone say that beauty will save the world. I don’t know if this is true, but I fully believe that savoring the beauty in life attunes our attention to God’s goodness. It can help alleviate the darkness pressing in around us by offering a parting of the clouds—a heightened glimpse of light and hope. I can’t speak for anyone else, but I know my life can always use an extra reminder that God is working behind the scenes.\n\nPsalm 92 is said to be a song for the Sabbath. It’s a declaration of God’s justice (v.15) and His faithful love both in the morning and at night (v.2). We need songs like this, songs of Scripture, to bury inside us and remind us what’s true. This way, on an afternoon that doesn’t feel very beautiful, we can sing the song that declares God is just and advocating on our behalf for the rightness of all things. When we meditate on these songs, our hope is restored. And we can find rest again.\n\nIn this psalm, we see a lot of interesting metaphors drawn from the natural world to describe the characteristics of the righteous person. Though the wicked “sprout like grass” (v.7), the righteous will thrive like “a palm tree” or a “cedar tree in Lebanon” (v.12). The righteous are planted in the Lord like roots of a tree and will live a fruitful life, becoming “healthy and green” (vv.13–14). These arborous metaphors symbolize—and prophesy about—the vibrancy of life hidden in Christ and the nourishment He gives us, just like water and sunshine to a plant. As we pursue a life of righteousness, our legacy becomes this anthem of God’s faithfulness, declaring “the LORD is just; he is my rock” (v.15).\n\nI love how many layers are woven into this psalm. At first glance, we’re told it’s a song to accompany our Sabbath rest. But in reading the lines of verse, we detect the heartbeat behind it: a desire for all things to be made right. The only reason to declare God as “just” is if you’ve been touched by injustice and, by doing so, participate in an act of rebellion against it.\n\nYou’ve probably heard the truism: “All shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well.” It was Julian of Norwich who first said it. She was an English woman who lived a solitary life devoted to God during the Middle Ages. Psalm 92 is the undercurrent to her words. They look ahead to a time when the fullness of God’s justice will have its reign on earth, even as we usher in kingdom wholeness today.\n\nWe can find true rest in the knowledge that God is just; there is “no unrighteousness in Him” (v.15). But He also chooses to partner with us in confronting the injustices of the world. Oh Lord, Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I grew up afraid.\n\nThunder, lightning, roller coasters, car crashes, plane crashes, tornadoes—loud, violent, terrifying scenarios that kept me up at night, or in the guidance counselor’s office at school any time it stormed. I was afraid of loud things, things that threatened to crash into my life and take away someone or something I loved. I would read Bible verses that promised me safety, plucked out of the psalms and taped on my bathroom mirror in college—-verses like these from Psalm 91: “Because you have made the LORD—my refuge, the Most High—your dwelling place, no harm will come to you” (vv.9–10).\n\nThat’s a formula I tend to like, because it gives me the perception of control; I make the Lord my “refuge,” and no harm will come to me. But many years of walking quietly in sadness with people I love have taught me there is no equation to prevent suffering. Sometimes storms enter our lives quickly like thunderclouds from the west. Sometimes they sneak in, just as the sun rises quietly in the east. But always, they come, just as they came for our Savior, Jesus Christ. When the devil tempts Jesus in the wilderness, the enemy quotes Psalm 91: “He will give his angels orders concerning you, to protect you, and they will support you with their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone” (Luke 4:10–11).\n\nIn their book, The Songs of Jesus, Tim and Kathy Keller wrote: “The devil wants us to think that God’s promises have failed if he lets us suffer. But the psalm later clarifies that God will save us ‘in trouble’ and not from it.” In other words, we do not need a refuge from the quiet, the sadness, brokenness, and pain; we need a refuge from the storm that is inevitably coming (John 16:33). Suffering was sewn into our existence at the fall, but Psalm 91 shouts into the rushing wind:\n\n“The one who lives under the protection of the Most High dwells in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say concerning the LORD, who is my refuge and my fortress … His faithfulness will be a protective shield” (vv.1–2,4).\n\nI am thankful for the whole of Scripture, and for the ways it quiets my soul on the hardest of days. The riches of Psalm 91 are vast, with so many metaphors and names for God, calling us backward and forward through the Old and New Testaments. It does so beautifully what the whole of Scripture does: it paints a picture of our hopeless existence apart from God, and it beckons us into the fullness of life in relationship with Him. A life that, though marked with suffering, is ultimately guaranteed and secured by the personhood and work of Jesus Christ.\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    When I was a kid, I used to be terrified that our house was going to burn down. I would lie awake in my bed, certain that at any moment I would see smoke coming from under my door, a raging fire just down the hallway ready to engulf my entire family, destroying everything in its wake. Before bed, I would ask my parents to close all the doors (to keep the fire from getting into our rooms) and make sure the oven was off, and every so often, I’d ask them to check our smoke detectors—just in case one was malfunctioning. My parents would do all of these things, lovingly reminding me that I was safe, that nothing was going to happen to me. And they would pray with me, inviting me to bring my fears and uncertainties to God, the One who protects me and strengthens me.\n\nThis psalm refers to God as the “LORD of Armies.” This name for God appears most often in the Minor Prophets, both before and after Judah’s exile into Babylon. The lives of God’s people were full of fear and uncertainty, and they were constantly reminded of the power their enemies held over them. Referring to God as the LORD of Armies reminded them of His ability to keep them from harm.\n\nThis whole psalm is a reminder of God’s unmatched power. The psalmist writes of God’s ability to provide calm and order in the midst of total chaos. The first stanza speaks of God’s protection from the natural elements, the second of God’s protection from other nations, and the third of God’s protection from fighting and wars. In every stanza, the psalmist reminds us that God is with us—that He is our refuge, that the LORD of Armies is our stronghold. How can we not bow down in praise of such a powerful God? With a God like this on our side, fighting for us, watching over us, our fears don’t stand a chance.\n\nThese days, I’m not as scared of my house burning down as I used to be. My fears are more concerned with uncertainty about the future and my need to control things. So although I am not a nation at war, I can still find rest in the fact that the LORD of Armies is with me. He is a refuge for my weary soul, a place of comfort in the midst of chaos. His power is stronger than even the most terrifying of armies, His love deeper than any raging sea. He is strong, He is good, and He will not let me go, even in the fiercest battle.\n\n                ",

    "devo_title": "The Lord Is My Shepherd",
    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Psalm 23 speaks to my heart—green pastures, quiet waters, right paths. I am an outdoorsy person by nature. I’d much rather get lost in the woods, alone with my thoughts, the trees, and the breeze, than be in any city. So, as I read these familiar verses, I want to go outside, to be witness to the goodness and beauty of the natural world. It also occurs to me that I have something in common with sheep—we can both get lost without hardly trying.\n\nSome years ago, I read about a Merino sheep in New Zealand named Shrek. He had wandered away from his flock and his shepherd and gotten lost. For six years, he lived in nearby caves, eating what he could find and avoiding the shearer’s blade. When Shrek was finally found, his wool weighed sixty pounds, and the raw weight of twenty men’s suits on his back was threatening his life. He had trouble walking, and his breathing was labored. He needed his shepherd. So do we.\n\nShepherds take care of sheep—plural—but in this psalm, the relationship is between one sheep and his Shepherd. It’s personal, much more intimate. “The LORD is my shepherd” (v.1, emphasis mine). These words are from David, but I can’t help but read them as my own. I think we were meant to, each one of us. The Lord is my Shepherd. He guides me, provides for me, protects me from my enemies.\n\nI don’t need to worry. “I have what I need” (v.1). I don’t need to struggle or strive. “He lets me lie down in green pastures” (v.2). Weariness does not have the final say. “He renews my life.” And I won’t ever get lost. (Not really, anyway.) “He leads me along the right paths for his name’s sake” (v.3). It is only because the Shepherd is so good that I can be still and rest, that I can have true peace.\n\nI could be happy for eternity being a beloved lamb of the Good Shepherd, but Psalm 23 doesn’t leave us as sheep. A shift occurs in verse 5. David begins to address God directly—the song becomes a prayer of thanksgiving. Not only that, but the pastoral imagery is replaced by a banquet scene. You and I have become honored guests of the King.\n\nThe table is set, and though my enemies might rage just outside, none of that matters (v.5). I am in the house of my Maker, the One who knows me and loves me better than anyone else. But the best part? I’m not just a guest. I get to stay in His presence forever—”as long as I live” (v.6), though the Hebrew phrase that’s been translated doesn’t limit this time to my natural lifespan. It has all come full circle—”I have what I need,” because I have the One I was created to know and love.\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    God is the standard of beauty, faithfulness, kindness, and truth. He is the source of all goodness.\n\nTo say God is great is to focus on His power: He speaks creation into existence, makes the skies thunder and rain, and sets the planets in their orbits. But to say God is good is different; it is not just another way of recognizing His power. The goodness of God speaks to His personal character—who He is in relationship to us. In all ways and in all things, God is good. He is never absent, disinterested, careless, ill-tempered, petty, spiteful, or mean. He is set apart from all evil and does what is right, faithful, kind, and true. Always.\n\nTrue goodness is defined by who God is. He doesn’t just do good—He is good. In Psalm 119:68, the psalmist prays, “You are good and you do what is good; teach me your statutes.” The key to understanding the goodness of God is learning who He is through His Word. If we don’t learn His statutes, we will bring our own definitions and impose them on God. And when He doesn’t do what we think He should, we will accuse Him of failing to be “good” by our own standards—not His.\n\nIn His goodness, God gives us what we need and withholds what we do not. If we ask for bread, He will not give us a harmful serpent or a useless stone, He will give us what we need (Luke 11:11; Matthew 7:9). The God who withholds no good thing is the same God who gives no bad thing. Sometimes we don’t realize that we ask God for stones and serpents. When we ask God to give us things that are useless or harmful, the good Father refuses. As sure as He will not give a serpent when His children ask for fish, neither will He give them a serpent when His children unwittingly ask for one.\n\nYes, God is great, but He is also good. All the time and in all things. He does good because He is good.\n\n                ",

But His righteousness can and should be cause for celebration, a source of immense comfort in a world where earthly justice falls short.\n\nWe ache for justice when we experience the ramifications of sin, both on a personal and a systemic scale. When something we love is violated, wounded, or broken, we don’t respond with indifference—we cry out, demanding accountability. If we, with our limited perspective, are so affected by injustice, how much more does God demand justice when His standard of what is good is not upheld?\n\nGod loves more deeply and thoroughly than we could ever imagine. He loves perfectly. When proclaiming Himself to Moses, God says He is “a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love and truth, maintaining faithful love to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity, rebellion, and sin. But he will not leave the guilty unpunished” (Exodus 34:6–7).\n\nGod’s understanding of guilt is also perfect, because He is all-knowing, holy, and infinite. He has no statute of limitations. He is not swayed by false testimony or inconclusive evidence. He is the perfect witness, who searches and knows every heart, every intention, every action (Job 28:24; Psalm 69:5). He is “faithful forever, executing justice for the exploited,” even when our lives are not long enough to see it (Psalm 146:7).\n\nUnlike what we experience from one another on earth, God is not faulty or vindictive. He does not overlook sin, nor does He demand more than what is just. This is good news, because we are not only victims of sin and injustice; we are also perpetrators. And yet the steep price our guilt demands is a price Christ already paid on the cross. And “if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).\n\nJesus tells us He has been given the right to pass judgment, and that He gives life to those who hear His Word and believe it (John 5:24). Our just Judge is also our Savior. He alone can mend the brokenhearted and offer hope to the unrighteous.\n\n               ",

He is always loving—even when He disciplines, even when He judges. It’s who He is. And this divine love is infinite, meaning it is bigger than we could ever imagine, even if we had a thousand lifetimes with which to ponder it. If we were to taste a full dose of God’s love, it would knock us, quite literally, out of our socks. We would be unable to stand in the presence of such passion.\n\nWe were made for God’s love, so it shouldn’t surprise us that the enemy of God’s people chooses to sow doubt at this critical place in our souls. Concerning the forbidden fruit in the garden, the serpent told Eve, “God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil” (Genesis 3:5). In other words, we believe the lie that God is somehow holding out on us, that He does not really love us. It worked with Adam and Eve, and the devil has been using this same tactic ever since.\n\nWe tend to filter what the Bible tells us about the love of God through our experience of love with people who, like us, love imperfectly. The Bible gives us a definition of love in 1 John, imploring us to not define love on our own terms, through our own broken experiences, but instead to see love from heaven’s perspective: “Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 4:10).\n\nEverything God does is loving. But His love is most clearly seen on the cross, because God’s love is sacrificial. He gives Himself for the good of those whom He loves. His love for us is true. There are holes in the hands of our Savior to prove it (John 20:27). Those holes are evidence of God’s love, declaring loudly that He does not withhold a single good thing from us, no matter what the enemy may try to tell us.\n\n                ",

God says, “You are to be holy to me because I, the LORD, am holy” (Leviticus 20:26). It is a seemingly impossible task. We have all been stained by sin and bear on our backs the weight of a sinful nature. Try as we might, we all “fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).\n\nWhen confronted with God’s holiness in the heavenly throne room, Isaiah’s response was nothing short of terror: “Woe is me for I am ruined because I am a man of unclean lips” (Isaiah 6:5). That’s how stark the contrast is between God’s perfect, holy nature and our utter lack of holiness. It’s not even close.\n\nTo be holy is to be set apart, uncommon, and raised up. God is all of these things, and we are not. But His response to Isaiah’s woeful plea was not to leave Isaiah ruined before the throne. Instead, He extended mercy and made atonement for Isaiah’s sin (Isaiah 6:6–7). God, in His perfection, has made a way for His people to be holy, for nothing is impossible with Him (Luke 1:37).\n\nBecause of Jesus’s sacrifice for us on the cross, all things are being made new (Revelation 21:5). We have been given God’s Spirit to walk with Him and practice holiness daily. Someday, all who know Christ will be perfected in Him. On that day, we will reflect God’s holiness to all creation, just as God designed it to be from the beginning.\n\nIn the meantime, God has given us the righteousness of His Son, making us holy in His sight. We are now set apart as His “holy nation” (1 Peter 2:9) and a temple for His Spirit. The holy presence of God that once made Isaiah tremble lives inside of believers. Our hope in Christ is so sure that God already regards us as people who no longer fall short, who have become holy, just as He is holy.\n\n                ",

When we consider His infinite greatness, it can be difficult to remember that while He is incomprehensibly grand, He is also personal and relational. He is Immanuel, “God with us” (Matthew 1:23).\n\nWe see this in Exodus 34, when God met with Moses on Mount Sinai. Moses came down from the mountain and found he had to conceal his face with a veil in order to speak with the Israelites. He “did not realize that the skin of his face shone” (v.29) after talking with God—that it was reflecting the radiance of God’s glory and frightening his fellow Israelites. And so, whenever Moses met with God, he would remove the veil, but then put it back on when speaking with God’s people.\n\nIn 2 Corinthians 3, Paul writes that the sacrifice of Christ and the ministry of the Holy Spirit have changed the nature of our relationship with God. We can now gaze upon the glory of God with unveiled faces, just as if we were staring into a mirror (v.18). While Moses was the mediator between God and His people, we now have Christ, the “radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of his nature” (Hebrews 1:3) as our Mediator. Because of Christ, we can enter into relationship with God both corporately as His Church and as individuals. Even more, we have received a Counselor, the Holy Spirit, to remain with us at all times.\n\nOur relationship with God is rooted in His glory and expressed in His immanence. God is present with us, deeply invested and active in each of our lives. He is a personal God. He relates to us, loves us, and cherishes us. Rather than being distant, inaccessible and detached, He has drawn near to us so that we might draw near to Him. By grace, He dwells among us, and by that same grace, He invites us into His presence.\n\n                ",

However, He does not act contrary to His nature.\n\n“Is anything too difficult for the Lord?”\n\nThis question has a clear, straightforward answer: No. Nothing is impossible with God. His omnipotence, His all-powerfulness, is perhaps one of the first things we learn about Him. It can also be a spiritual stumbling block for human understanding, in things both trivial and serious.\n\nAlong these lines, you may have heard some form of this brain-teaser: “If God can do all things, is it possible for God to create a rock that is too big for Him to lift?” It’s a question that suspends normal logic in an attempt to stump us, but as C. S. Lewis reminds us in his book The Problem of Pain, “Nonsense remains nonsense, even when we talk it about God.”\n\nIn more serious matters—in times of grief, struggle, and loss—we wonder, Where is God in the midst of my pain? How could He let this happen? Like the disciples, we cry out, “Don’t you care…?” (Mark 4:38). We echo Martha’s sentiments from John 11, saying, “Master, if only you had been here…” (v.21). When we read these stories, we see them met with near-immediate fixes at the hand of Jesus. But we also know that God does not always stop the storm or raise the dead when we think He should. If God is able to do all things, why doesn’t He “fix” all things, already? Why let hard things happen in the first place?\n\nGod holds power over all things, governs all things, and by Him all things hold together (Colossians 1:17). And that power, that impenetrable grip on the cosmos, sustains us through every wind and wave that comes our way, whether or not we remain on our feet. In time, we begin to understand His omnipotence in light of His other attributes. God can do anything, but He does not act against His own character or nature: His goodness and justice, His mercy and love.\n\nWhile His omnipotence is a certain terror to those who oppose Him, it is a resounding comfort to His children; God is good and promises good to those who love Him. Nothing is impossible for Him, and nothing can prevent Him from achieving His good will.\n\n                ",

When we recognize that we have, once again, turned aside to idols of our own making, there are Scriptures that declare God’s faithfulness in spite of our frailty. And when we have been burned by some injustice—life-shattering or trivial—we can thank our Savior for being a righteous Judge who promises to set all things right in the end. Reflecting on God’s attributes can bring us peace in the midst of struggles. But there is one that can leave us feeling exposed: God’s omniscience.\n\nBecause He is all-knowing, there is nothing hidden from God’s sight—nothing in waking life or even in our imaginations. There is no event in the past, present, or future that takes Him by surprise. The entire universe is an open book.\n\nThis kind of knowledge in anyone else’s hands would be a dangerous weapon. It would be appropriate to live in a constant state of fear. But God’s omniscience is coupled with His other attributes. To be known by God, then, is to be valued and loved. None of us are here by mistake. He wants to know us. And that’s a very good thing; within each of us is a desire to be known.\n\nWe all want to be fully known and understood, and then to be fully loved. Of course, we too often conclude in our hearts we are unloveable. After all, we how we’ve done wrong and missed the mark, how easily we’ve given in to temptation. Our hearts condemn us daily. But “God is greater than our hearts, and he knows all things” (1 John 3:20).\n\nOn the day of Solomon’s coronation, David told his son, “The LORD searches every heart and understands the intention of every thought” (1 Chronicles 28:9). In these words, there is a warning, but there is also grace. True, there is no hiding from God. But there also isn’t anyone who could possibly know us better. Because Jesus dealt with our sin on the cross, purifying us as a bride for her husband, God’s omniscience is not reason to fear blanket condemnation; instead, it’s an invitation to true intimacy with our Maker.\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    God is present everywhere in His creation but also above and beyond it. This remained true even as Jesus entered our world as a man and remains true as the Holy Spirit takes up residence within believers.\n\nThe Bible can be described as the story of God’s presence with His people. From walks in the garden with Adam and Eve to the incarnation to the gift of His Spirit at Pentecost, God was there. But the presence of God is not limited to any one location or situation.\n\nUsing a series of rhetorical questions, God outlines the all-encompassing nature of His omnipresence through the prophet Jeremiah:\n\n“Am I a God who is only near… and not a God who is far away? Can a person hide in secret places where I cannot see him?… Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” (Jr 23:23–24).\n\nThese verses not only show that God is both near and far, filling the heavens and the earth, but that He is always with us. There is no escaping His presence. At first, we might find this truth unsettling, but when we understand God’s heart toward His people, we can find it comforting. We echo the words of the psalmist: “But as for me, God’s presence is my good” (Psalm 73:28).\n\nGod’s omnipresence means He sees us, knows us, is with us, and will never leave us. It’s a very practical truth because the greater our awareness of His presence, the more we live with a healthy fear of the Lord. We think twice before giving in to temptation, knowing our sins are not secret. We learn to go through our day with God, abiding in Him moment by moment. We find it a natural thing to pray constantly (1 Thessalonians 5:17), because He is always right there with us.\n\nUpon completing His earthly ministry, and before ascending to heaven, Jesus promised His disciples He would send the Holy Spirit to them. His last words in the Gospel of Matthew are, “I am with you always, to the end of the age” (28:20). We experience Jesus’s constant presence through His Spirit, who lives in all believers. And one day, when Jesus returns, we will see Him not just with eyes of faith, but “face to face” (1 Corinthians 13:12).\n\n                ",

We are always seeking the next, the better, the unknown. Even if we prefer to hold change at an arm’s length, it is inevitable. The seasons shift, the stars fall, our numbered hairs fall out, and our hearts undergo the only constant we know—change.\n\nThe book of Ecclesiastes contains this famous refrain, charged with the impatience, discomfort, and hopefulness of our ever-changing lives:\n\nThere is an occasion for everything,\nand a time for every activity under heaven:\na time to give birth and a time to die;\na time to plant and a time to uproot (3:1–2).\n\nWe live our lives seemingly anchored to little more than change itself. And yet Scripture beckons us to drop our anchor and hold fast to the One who never changes.\n\nOur God is unchangeable because He is perfect. Nothing can be added or taken away from Him. Everything He does is consistent with who He is. God’s promises are the same, and His ability to keep them will never waver. In Malachi 3, God tells His people: “Because I, the LORD, have not changed, you descendants of Jacob have not been destroyed” (v.6). In short, God’s immutability means we can count on Him, no matter what.\n\nJob, whose life changed in dramatic and painful ways, knew God to be always true to His character. “He is unchangeable, who can oppose him?” he asked (Job 23:13). Job staked his hope—his life—on his belief that God will always be who He declares Himself to be and do what He says He will do.\n\nJob’s hope is our hope.\n\nComplete, unchangeable, perfect—this is our God. As the ancient doxology “Gloria Patri” declares:\n\nGlory to the Father and to the Son\nand to the Holy Spirit;\nas it was in the beginning is now\nand will be forever. Amen.\n\n ",

He is infinite, eternal, and unfathomable, yet He reveals Himself to us through the universe He made and His infallible Word. \n\nWhatever we think of when we think about God is, at the very least, incomplete. He is infinite, but our imaginations are limited. He is unfathomable, so our thoughts cannot plumb the depths. He is the Creator of everything, yet we are constrained by metaphors that come from the created world. The very idea that we might classify or categorize God is laughable. He cannot be tamed or studied. He is beyond our reach and beyond our understanding. \n\nAnd yet we can know Him. He has graciously entered our world, time and time again, so that we might be His children and His true image-bearers. He was in the garden with Adam and Eve. He spoke to Noah, Abraham, and Moses. His presence filled the tabernacle and, later, the temple. He put on flesh and became one of us. And He has gifted His Spirit to His people, in order that we might know Him more intimately still. “The LORD had his heart set on your fathers and loved them. He chose their descendants after them—he chose you out of all the peoples, as it is today” (Deuteronomy 10:15). \n\nWe can know God because He has chosen to be known. He is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-present. He is loving and just, merciful and good, and a thousand other things beside. “For the LORD your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God” (v.17). Theologians have made many a complicated list of God’s attributes, filling thick volumes on shelves that occupy the libraries of this world. But those books amount to what we can know about God. We have been given an opportunity to go much deeper than that. We have been invited to love Him and be loved by Him—to know Him in a way that defies our limited capacity for knowledge and understanding and, in so doing, bring Him glory.\n\nWhatever measure of knowledge we have about God is granted to us so that we might worship Him, not merely as admirers from afar but as dearly loved children. \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Have you ever considered thanksgiving a weapon for spiritual warfare? It sounds a bit strange, but I believe that the discipline of giving thanks is one of the greatest assets we have in our spiritual lives.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to apply this truth is to consider Paul’s command in 1 Thessalonians 5:18: “Give thanks in everything.” Paul cannot possibly mean “in everything,” can he? What about the times in life when we lack peace? What about the times in our lives when our weaknesses are painfully exposed? What about the times when someone causes us to suffer? Really, Paul? Are we to rejoice under those circumstances too? Are we to do good to others, even when they have done harm to us?\n\nThe apostle Paul is perfectly clear in his command to give thanks in everything. In fact, he says, “This is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus” (v.18). It is God’s will for us to give thanks, even in situations where we might be tempted to do otherwise. I believe the key to this God-honoring mindset of thanksgiving is found at the end of 1 Thessalonians 5:21: “Hold on to what is good.” This is not a baptized motivational speech, but rather a call to consider the work of God in the midst of our trials.\n\nWhen we lack peace, the only one to whom we can turn is the God of peace. When our weaknesses are exposed, we can rejoice that God’s grace is sufficient for us. When others cause us to suffer, we have the opportunity to offer forgiveness and grace. In responding in these ways, we not only glorify God, but we also make His goodness known among the people around us.\n\nThe weapon of thanksgiving is a powerful tool for maintaining a godly, overcoming perspective. It shows we trust in God’s providential care. To me, a spiritual giant is someone whose heart is ruled by the peace of Christ. In life’s darkest moments, the thanksgiving they’ve cultivated in their hearts can pierce through discouragement and despair.\n\nBrother, learn to fight with thanksgiving. Consider the good providence of God, even in your darkest moments. Thanksgiving may not deliver us out of difficulty, but God can certainly use it to deliver us through difficulty.\n\nWritten by Matt Capps \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    There are certain experiences in life we look forward to with eager anticipation: getting a driver’s license, being able to vote, graduating college, landing a first job, perhaps getting married and having children, achieving certain career goals, and maybe even retirement. In all of these, there is the built-in excitement of hoping for what we have not yet seen or experienced. However, once these milestones have been reached and the hardships of life have returned to swallow our focus and energy, life can seem pretty mundane.\n\nThere is something right about feeling the dullness that inevitably follows these experiences; they cannot compare to the solid joys and lasting treasure that come with hoping in God and the glorious future He promises to all His children. In the pattern of hoping for what we do not yet see, we are met with the reality that nothing in this world can provide true and lasting satisfaction.\n\n“Hope that is seen,” wrote the apostle Paul, “is not hope.” By contrast, “If we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience” (Romans 8:24–25). This is the essence of the promises of the gospel in Scripture. We are meant to hope for what we do not see and have not yet fully experienced.\n\nIsaiah might be the most hope-filled of the Old Testament prophets. When he finally comes to the turning point of his prophetic message in chapter 40, he sets out the glorious resurrection hope that believers eagerly anticipate as we wait for Christ’s return:\n\n“They who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint” (Isaiah 40:31).\n\nIn the moment, we may struggle to understand how we will come to attain these promises, but we are encouraged to pursue them by faith. Jesus has secured an everlasting joy, an inheritance of hope for His people through His death and resurrection. Though we do not now see all that He has for us, we wait for it with patience. This is the essence of hope—it works in us even when we do not see precisely how things will work out. It is sure and certain. Because of the saving work of Jesus Christ crucified and risen, there are no uncertain promises of God—though they remain unseen. When we long for these promises to come true, we will not be disappointed.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I attended church regularly growing up, but it wasn’t until I wrestled with a host of fears and anxieties in my junior year of high school that the Lord transformed my heart. It was during that year my best friend, a girl I really liked, rejected me after I told her I wanted to date her. It was so awkward that we barely spoke the entire school year. This led to a significant amount of anxiety for me, and it revealed my idolatry. The Lord used the rejection of a girl I loved, and the anxiety that resulted, to open my eyes to His acceptance of me.\n\nBut how do we give thanks to God when we’re gripped by a more serious anxiety—like the anxiety that results from a lack of food or shelter?\n\nJesus says in the Sermon on the Mount:\n\n“Consider the birds of the sky: They don’t sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you worth more than they? Can any of you add one moment to his life span by worrying? And why do you worry about clothes? Observe how the wildflowers of the field grow: They don’t labor or spin thread. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was adorned like one of these. If that’s how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow, won’t he do much more for you—you of little faith? (Matthew 6:27–30)\n\nI love the logic Jesus employs here. He argues from the lesser to the greater. If God takes care of the birds and the flowers, how much more will He take care of us? We are most anxious when we forget we bear the image of God and have a role to play in His ongoing plan of redemption. When we step back from the circumstances that produce anxiety, we are better able to see how much God loves us and cares for us.\n\nSo what, then? What are we supposed to do when anxiety has a stranglehold on our hearts—when darkness surrounds us? We have to remember that light will overcome the darkness and that its victory doesn’t depend on us or our faith. It depends on God’s faithfulness to us. Whatever we might face tomorrow, God is far greater and far more powerful than any of our worries.\n\nWritten by Chris Martin \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Changing our perspective often helps us see things we couldn’t otherwise see. This is one of the reasons I like to go to the mountains every so often. In the relatively flat landscape of the Midwest, there just isn’t much in the way of challenging terrain around me. But if you put me in the Rocky Mountains, my perspective changes along with the elevation. Summiting the peak of one of Colorado’s fourteen-thousand-foot mountains is more than a challenge; it’s beyond me. Whether or not I make it all the way to the top, the change in perspective I gain helps me see my life and my heart more clearly.\n\nWe often need our perspective on God’s mercy to be challenged so it can be changed. In Luke 7, Simon, who is a Pharisee and a respected religious leader in his community, hosts a dinner for Jesus. In today’s world, such an evening would include classical music, proper attire, and fine dining. It is supposed to be an elegant evening. But then “a woman in the town who was a sinner” enters the scene and washes Jesus’s feet with her tears before anointing them with expensive perfume. Her presence and her actions could hardly be more scandalous.\n\nAs Simon mentally objects to what she was doing, Jesus blindsides him with a parable meant to challenge his perspective and ours. He asks who will appreciate being forgiven a debt more: someone who owes a lot or someone who owes a little? The answer, of course, is the person who owes a lot. The point is that the “sinful” woman had been forgiven a huge debt of sin, so she showed a lot more love to Jesus than the self-righteous Pharisees, who believed themselves to be pretty good people living pretty great lives.\n\nIf we evaluate ourselves from the flatlands of our own righteousness for too long, we may become convinced we’re not that bad, that we’re doing okay. We might reason that since we haven’t committed any terrible sins like murder, we’re actually respectable people who associate with a respectable Jesus. But when we see ourselves and our righteousness from the high mountain peaks of God’s holiness, we see our true condition much more clearly. Instead of being “nice people” who have it all together, apart from Christ we were actually “dead in [our] trespasses and sins” and “by nature children under wrath” (Ephesians 2:1,3). For all our imagined respectability, we stood under the curse of God before receiving His mercy.\n\nWe must look from Jesus’s vantage point if we are to be truly thankful for God’s mercy. We have been forgiven much, so we can love much. We have been rescued by God’s grace, which we didn’t earn but received through faith. Standing on the mountain of God’s mercy and kindness should cause our hearts to explode with joy and thankfulness. He is so kind! Let’s give thanks today, brothers, for His unfailing mercy and love.\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

Ask any coach worth his salt, and he’ll tell you he pushes hardest the guys with with the most room to grow.\n\nWhen you’re a young player, this can be confusing. It’s easy to think the coach has it out for you, or he’s just picky, or maybe he doesn’t understand what motivates you. I know a handful of athletes who have walked away from their respective sports because they got tired of the tough love. Over the years, some of them have expressed regret, or at least curiosity about what might have been if they had stuck with it.\n\nMuch like a good coach, God disciplines those whom He loves. The difference is that God loves all His children. This is why we see the psalmist thanking God for His correction. He knows God’s discipline enters our lives to wisely and lovingly form us in ways that would otherwise be impossible.\n\nIn fact, it was so important to the psalmist that he was losing sleep over it. He didn’t haphazardly express thanks during his morning coffee; he rose in the middle of the night to cry out to God and praise Him for His goodness in providing correction and judgement (Psalm 119:62).\n\nThe writer of Proverbs 4 reminds his sons of these same truths. A good father disciplines his son for his son’s good. It is not a form of punishment or retribution. It is not driven by rage, but by love and compassion. This can be difficult to sort out, especially if your experience of discipline from your earthly parents was unhealthy or non-existent. Discipline is meant to lead to character formation and growth.\n\nGod is a perfect Father, and His approach to discipline is trustworthy, steady, and lovingly tailored to each of His children, providing just what we need, when we need it. Of course, it may not feel pleasant in the moment—discipline rarely is—but the more we know the heart of the Father, the more we will trust His loving correction in our lives.\n\nAs you spend time in the Word today, seek the Father’s loving heart for you. Ask Him to show you areas of your life that need His correction, guidance, and encouragement. And as you pray, search those places of discomfort, and be willing to submit to God in order to change and grow. If you’re experiencing uncomfortable but necessary correction, ask God to give you a glimpse of where He’s leading you—and the strength to grow more like Him.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I recently read a book in which the author described going to an estate sale. He enjoyed looking for rare and out-of-print books, but something different happened at this one. As he filed through the house with other strangers seeking to purchase what the deceased left behind, he started to think about something other than finding a good bargain. Was that his favorite chair?Did he purchase this item or was it a gift from someone who loved him? Then, he realized that one day people would come and pick through his possessions as well. Everything he spent his life accumulating would be sold to strangers at a bargain price.\n\nConsumerism has become so rampant in our culture that we don’t notice it anymore, and we struggle to understand what this does to our own hearts. Our drive for more, newer, bigger, and better causes ceaseless unrest and anxiety in our hearts. Left unchecked, we can make ourselves and everyone around us miserable as we endlessly grope for that which will never satisfy.\n\nToday’s readings anchor our hearts to a truth we need now more than ever—God gives us everything we need in the exact moment we need it. He knows us, He loves us, and He provides for us. This assurance saturates the message of Psalm 23. The Lord shows Himself to be a loving shepherd who relentlessly cares for His people.\n\nDavid’s metaphor helps us understand how God cares for our every need—physical, financial, emotional, and spiritual. He summarizes God’s action towards us in the last verse, saying, “Only goodness and faithful love will pursue me all the days of my life” (v.6). David employed the Hebrew word for pursue, the same word used to describe Israel chasing down the Philistine army after David struck down Goliath. What an illustration of how God chases after us with His goodness and loyal love!\n\nWhen we understand God’s heart for us, we learn how to be content in our circumstances. We know that God is not depriving us for His entertainment or holding a grudge over some sin we committed. Instead, we live where we live, drive what we drive, eat what we eat, and earn what we earn because God, out of His loyal love for us, knows that this is what we need for the good of our souls right now.\n\nWe know from Romans 8 that because God gave Christ to us, we can be sure that He will not withhold anything we need. When we grasp the love of God for us in Jesus Christ, we can lay down our restless striving and say with the apostle Paul, “I have learned the secret of being content—whether well fed or hungry, whether in abundance or in need.”\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    One sign of pride is an inability to stop and rest. It’s a particular plague for church leaders like me. After all, Sunday is the pinnacle of our church ministry week, and most people in full-time church ministry spend the week getting ready for Sunday.\n\nBut God has commanded His people, “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8). Even if I can’t keep this command on Sunday, I must rest. When I fail to do so, I’ve given in to pride. When, like Martha, I become distracted by my many tasks (Luke 10:40), I’ve taken an arrogant posture toward God. I’ve begun to think that I can earn rest. In those moments, I believe the lie that rest depends on my readiness—on my ability to finish that assignment, return every phone call, or zero out my inbox.\n\nBut the truth is, God doesn’t give rest on my timetable. Keeping a Sabbath involves acknowledging our human limitations and submitting to God when He makes clear that it’s time to stop. If we’re humble enough to receive the lesson, the rhythms of the work week—and of the setting sun each day—will teach us to rest even when our work is not yet done. You see, rest doesn’t depend on our work.\n\nRest is a gift. God gives His rest and peace freely to us without thought of our earning it. As Jesus says, “I do not give to you as the world gives” (John 14:27). And because rest is a gift, it is something for which we should give thanks.\n\nWe can give thanks for what rest teaches us about God. When God rested on the seventh day, He showed us His grace by bending down to our level. He didn’t need to rest, but He modeled for us what it means to stop, showing us that we’re made for rest.\n\nWe can give thanks because rest teaches us what is most important. It shows us that being still and being with God are more important than our frantic doing.\n\nFinally, we give thanks because rest points the way to eternity. There remains a Sabbath rest for God’s people (Hebrews 4:9). When Christ returns, we’ll beat our swords into plows (Micah 4:3), and wars will cease (Psalm 46:9). On that day, our God will welcome us into eternal rest and perpetual joy.\n\nFor this, we rest and give thanks.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    For the past year, I have been a full-time teacher. I teach 8th grade New Testament, 9th grade Systematic Theology, and 10th grade Hermeneutics. Some days are hard. But every day is rewarding. I love the students. I love the subjects. And I love the people I work with; they are brilliant and kind and fun to be with. My time in the classroom is almost always simultaneously exhausting and life-giving. If you are a runner, you get it. After a good run, you can be exhausted and also energized at the same time. I regularly experience the teacher’s version of the “runner’s high.” I love my work. I am “occupied with the joy of [my] heart,” as Solomon put it (Ecclesiastes 5:20).\n\nBut this was not always the case. I used to work for a bank. On the surface, it was a great job—good pay, great hours, amazing benefits—but it wasn’t quite right for me. I was a terrible banker and routinely hauled in to my manager’s office because my numbers were so low. Mine was a sales position, and I was a lousy salesman. I eventually tried a position in the back office, thinking that might be the promised land because there were no sales to be had in that area. But, alas, I was still being measured, though in seconds rather than dollars.\n\nDuring that season, being thankful for work took a lot of, well, work. This is something we all experience at one time or another. Perhaps that’s why God gives us a reminder in His Word: “And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him” (Colossians 3:17). There are times when our passions, strengths, and experience all collide in our work, and thankfulness just flows out without effort. At other times, our thankfulness becomes an exercise of faith, as we trust that God is using our experiences to shape us into people who reflect His Son. It is then that we must remember we are really working for the Lord, and He sees every small sacrifice we make to get a job done.\n\nMy job as a banker was never a great fit for me, but I am thankful for the experience. Not only did God use it to provide for my family during a time of transition, but He’s still using it to show me how blessed I am today to be working at a place I love. In the end, it is God who gives life, and not our work, so let’s be thankful for every good gift that comes from His hand, even the ones that may not seem good in the moment. \n\nWritten by Matthew B.

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The Bible is a divine work-the very words of God. It is also a profoundly human book, dealing in real life. Throughout the pages of Scripture, the lowest lows are juxtaposed against divine hope and promise. Often we see this in a single passage, and it should tell us something about reality: pain and hardship are real and profound in this fallen world, but God’s goodness is greater still, and it is present during the darkest of times.\n\nPsalm 31 is a perfect of example of this. It moves from rejoicing and gladness in verses 7-8, to distress, sorrow, and despair in verses 9-13. But then it shifts back again as verses 14-24 are an expression of trust, hope, and faith in light of God’s goodness and restoration. It reads a little like a hike in the mountains. You start fresh and hopeful, but sink into discouragement and exhaustion as the trail keeps winding up and up with no end in sight. But, eventually, you do make it to the top and enjoy majestic vistas as far as the eye can see.\n\nSo often, we create a false dichotomy in which the difficult parts of life leave no room for hope or thankfulness, and the good times wipe away all memory of the hard times (or the realization they will come again). We wallow in pain and get high on happiness, forgetting that each is just as real when we are experiencing the other. In short, we forget reality as God describes it in His Word.\n\nJames 1 tells us, “Consider it a great joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you experience various trials, because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance” (vv. 2-3). First Peter 4 says we shouldn’t be surprised when trials come, though we often are, and should instead rejoice (vv. 12-13). Wallowing in misery would seem to be the natural response to tough times, and yet we’re supposed to be thankful? Yes, and here’s why: everything that’s true of God when life is good is just as true when life falls apart. The same joys that lead us to spiritual highs are real when we are at our lowest. God is God even when we cannot see what He is doing or why He is doing it. He is working, and when our faith is tested we come out stronger, deeper, and wiser.\n\nThankfulness and suffering are not opposites. They are a cord of two strands. Followers of Christ have so much to be thankful for in every circumstance. Our problem is that we are often only thankful for our circumstances instead of being thankful in them. So when (not if) you go through trials, remember that Scripture is both perfectly divine and profoundly human. In it, God speaks and says, “For I will satisfy the weary soul, and every languishing soul I will replenish” (Jeremiah 31:25, ESV). There are times when we are weary. And there are times when we languish. In those times, we need to listen to what God’s Word is telling us, not what our circumstances are saying. \n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    For most of my life, I’ve attended what I would consider to be serious-minded, theologically robust churches. The ministers of these churches often impressed upon us the need to prepare ourselves to enter the worship service with a sense of reverence appropriate to coming into the presence of a majestic and infinitely holy God. Every worship service began with a call to worship from the Psalms. The Word was then read and preached, hymns were sung, prayers were offered, and the Supper was attended with a deep sense of reverence. \n\nI think the emphasis on the need for reverence was good. However, as I look back, I wonder if something important was missing from those services. The ministers sometimes gave the impression that if we are to come into God’s presence reverently, then we must do so with something of an austere demeanor. But that’s not the picture of worship the Bible gives us. The infinitely holy God commands His people to come into His presence with great joy and thanksgiving. What sort of God commands His people to worship Him with jubilant thanksgiving? Yet we find such commands sprinkled throughout the Psalms. \n\nPsalm 95, one of the more sobering of the worship Psalms, begins with the psalmist calling the people of God into the presence of God: \n\n“Come, let us shout joyfully to the LORD, shout triumphantly to the rock of our salvation! Let us enter his presence with thanksgiving; let us shout triumphantly to him in song” (vv.1–2). \n\nWhat better way to worship of our Creator and Redeemer than to begin by joyfully and gratefully praise Him for our salvation in Christ. We have peace with God through Jesus. His sacrificial death has rescued us from the clutches of Satan and redeemed us from sin and death. Our future is as bright as the promises of God are sure.   \n\nThe grace of God in the gospel is so spectacular that Jesus says “there is joy in the presence of God’s angels over one sinner who repents” (Luke 15:10). If there is joy in the heavenly worship room over the grace of God bringing a lost sinner home, then there also should be great joy in the presence of God on earth as those same redeemed sinners gather to worship the One who has redeemed them. In light of these precious truths, we gladly “enter his presence with thanksgiving” and “shout triumphantly to him in song.”\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

Today’s Scripture readings are an assurance that you are not.\n\nIn Matthew 15, Jesus gives thanks for the bread He is about to multiply to feed the hungry crowds. In Luke 10, He thanks God that the mysteries of the kingdom of God are hidden from the learned, and are revealed instead to His disciples. In John 11, just before raising Lazarus from the dead, Jesus thanks God for hearing Him, and says He is praying aloud so that those gathered will believe that He and the Father are one. Finally, in Luke 22, we come to the institution of the Lord’s Supper, where Jesus thanks God for the bread and the cup, which represent His body and blood.\n\nWhat do these passages have in common? What is Jesus thanking God for in each of them? In a word, communion. Jesus gives thanks for communion between God and man. When Jesus gives thanks, He thanks God for being near to His people—for being not only present, but active in a saving, nourishing, and illuminating way. Food for the hungry. Truth for the disciple. Healing for the dead and dying. The body and blood of Christ for sinners. Jesus thanks God for being near.\n\nThe beautiful irony here is that, ultimately, Jesus is thanking the Father for His own incarnation. He would feed the hungry, draw His children near, raise the dead, and deliver us from our sin. He would be with us. He would make Himself known. For this, Jesus thanked His Father. If this is what Jesus gives thanks for, why would we imagine He is distant?\n\nPonder that, you who feel alone in the world. You who feel overlooked, forgotten, and cast aside—consider that when the Son of God gave thanks to the Father, it was for the opportunity to draw near to us and to respond to our deepest needs. The Son of God incarnate is the greatest gift we’ve ever been given, and Jesus Himself thanks God for this gift. “He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, gave it to them, and said, ‘This is my body, which is given for you’” (Lk 22:19).\n\nYou are not forgotten or overlooked by God. You are an object of His affection. When Jesus thanked God, it was because He had drawn near to us. Be of good cheer. You are loved.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

Choosing one was mandatory—everyone needed a music class—and it was one of the easiest decisions of my young life. But not because I loved music. I would join the band, and I would play the trumpet. “Why?” some asked. “Because it only has three buttons, so it’s obviously the easiest instrument to play.”\n\nI couldn’t have been more wrong in my assumption, as anyone who has been in middle school band class would know, but that’s not the point here. The point is this: I was mortified at the prospect of my classmates hearing me sing or, even worse, of being asked to sing a solo.\n\nToo many of us men are afraid to sing our thanks to God. I am a lot more comfortable singing now than I was in middle school, but it still feels awkward at times. The problem is that our discomfort with opening our mouths and singing in tune (or at least trying) conflicts with the call to rejoice and sing praises of thanks to our God. This call is given to us throughout Scripture.\n\nEzra 3:11 tells us that, following the reconstruction of the temple, “they sang with praise and thanksgiving to the LORD: ‘For he is good; his faithful love to Israel endures forever.’ Then all the people gave a great shout of praise to the LORD because the foundation of the LORD’s house had been laid.”\n\nIn Ephesians 5, Paul tells us to speak to one another “in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs… giving thanks always to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ” (vv. 19–20). And in Philippians 4:4, he says, “Rejoice in the Lord. I will say it again: Rejoice!” He urges us to be grateful again and again. Rejoicing in the Lord is the normal Christian life.\n\nUnfortunately, gratitude toward others and toward God goes unspoken and unsung far too often. When we understand the grace God has shown us in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, any inhibitions that may bind our hearts and muzzle our mouths must be loosed.\n\nGod knows our hearts, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t called to open our mouths and sing about the faithful, everlasting love of God! We do this not only to praise God, but also to encourage our brothers and sisters in Christ. Christ gave his life for us; we can give up our pride for Him. Let’s rejoice and sing of our thankfulness to God together.\n\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I recently made a major career shift from full-time teaching to full-time artist. I’ve spent years doing private commission and design work on the side, but it is really my first love and it is great to finally be doing it as my main gig. Of course, it also means that the paychecks don’t come in at a regular pace. There are seasons of plenty, but also seasons of leanness, and I can’t decide if it is easier to be thankful when things are plentiful or when things are lean. I find that in either case, I can quickly turn my focus inward and forget to acknowledge God.\n\nOne of the most repeated themes of Scripture is the need to give thanks. In times of plenty and in times of want, we are enjoined to “enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise” (Psalm 100:4). Why? Because there is no God like God. I know this may seem simple and straightforward, but apart from His grace, our hearts are not naturally inclined to give thanks.\n\nSolomon could have patted himself on the back for successfully building the temple. Ungratefulness is just that easy. Even Adam and Eve’s fall was an act of ungratefulness, despising the good that God had given and choosing instead what He had not given. In seasons of plenty, we can take for granted God’s provision. In seasons of want, we can grumble and worry like Israel in the wilderness, wondering if God is willing or even able to help us in our time of need.\n\nThe human heart has a real proclivity to be dissatisfied. We like to tell ourselves that if circumstances were different, or our children were more obedient, or our friends were more understanding, or our house was bigger, or our talents were better appreciated, then we’d be content. But contentment doesn’t begin with circumstances. It begins when we acknowledge that the Lord is God (Psalm 100:3)\n\nWhen God calls His people to a posture of thanksgiving, He is calling us to the only possible posture of true worship. When we recognize that God is God, and that He is faithful and good, then we begin to comprehend the extent of His graciousness and love toward us. He made us. He shepherds us and calls us His own. He made Himself low, and bought us with His own precious blood. We are His, and “because of the LORD’s faithful love we do not perish” (Lamentations 3:22). Every day, every provision, every talent, every circumstance, is a gift of the never-ending mercy of God.\n\nBecause of His covenant faithfulness, we are called to neither boast nor worry, but simply to give thanks. The only proper response to God’s grace is gratefulness. Thanks be to God!\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    For several years now, I have periodically struggled to sleep well. This has not always been the case. For years, it was my wife who had to fight for a good night’s sleep. If she woke up for any reason, that was it; worry and fear would overcome her, and she could not go back to sleep. I would listen and try to sympathize but, like I said, this was not my problem. I was sleeping well.\n\nThat is, until about four years ago. Stress from my job, worry about my children, and frustration over continued financial difficulties all conspired to have me join my wife in her sleep troubles.\n\nThe pattern of my insomnia took on a frustrating sameness. I wouldn’t sleep well one night, and so, the next I would be overly tired from not sleeping well the night before. I would take something to help me sleep. Then, for reasons unknown, I would wake up sometime between two and four in the morning, my mind racing through worrisome scenarios that would be of little concern were it between two and four in the afternoon. This happened night after night after night. Then, all of a sudden, the cycle would end, and I would sleep well every night for several months before the process would begin all over again.\n\nIf that sounds awful, it’s because it was awful. I’m not quite sure why I started having trouble sleeping. But, eventually, it occurred to me that instead of worrying and fearing everything under the sun, I should give thanks to God for everything under the sun. So that’s what I started to do; I started to give thanks whenever I could not go back to sleep.\n\nMy prayers didn’t work like a magical incantation, instantly securing the sleep I so desperately desired and needed. But why do we give thanks anyway? Is it simply because we like what God has given us? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nWhen I gave thanks during those restless nights, I was reminded of something a lot more important than getting a good night’s sleep; I was reminded of God’s love for me. The things I thanked God for in the middle of the night deepened my experience of His love. I saw that insomnia is temporary, as are most circumstances in this life, but “His faithful love endures forever” (Psalm 136:1). The more I gave thanks at 3 a.m., the more I was reminded of how much He loves me.\n\nTwo things happened as a result of this new practice. First, I began to thank God even for those “awful prayer times” because I knew they were doing something in me as a follower of Christ that could not be done in any other way. Second, and more importantly, I began to see Jesus as more desirable than even the sleep I knew I needed. The more I thanked God for how He has provided for me and my family, the more I found myself thanking Him for providing Jesus to save us. This was a new rest—a grateful resting in His enduring love.\n\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    In recent years, a seemingly endless flood of books, articles, and social media memes have lauded the benefits of gratitude, encouraging us to become more grateful people. Truth be told, many of us have learned the hard way that the alternative—an entitled, complaining attitude—produces no good fruit, only misery. So when it comes to giving thanks, our experience confirms what scientific studies and Scripture agree upon: gratitude is good for us and good for the world.  \n\nAnd yet, do we really understand what it means to give thanks from a biblical perspective? Consider 1 Chronicles 16:8:\n\n“Give thanks to the LORD; call on his name; proclaim his deeds among the peoples.”\n\nTaking each phrase in turn, we begin to see the key elements of giving thanks, as portrayed in the Scriptures. \n\nFirst, thanksgiving is to the Lord. It is first and foremost godward. It is vertical before it is horizontal. Our gratitude for God and to God lies beneath our gratitude to other people or for other things. Gratitude, at its root, is worship, and worship is what we were created for. When we worship, we ascribe worth to an infinitely worthy God, and when we fail to worship, we miss the point of our existence. Ingratitude is a clear indicator that we have lost touch with reality. Perhaps nowhere in Scripture is this more clearly stated than in Romans 1:21:\n\n“For though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or show gratitude. Instead, their thinking became worthless, and their senseless hearts were darkened.”\n\nSecond, giving thanks shows that we understand God is the source of every good gift we enjoy. To depend on God, to “call on his name,” is glorifying to Him and humbling to us. He is the Creator; we are His creatures. He is the Provider; we are the recipients of His provision. He is the Savior; we are people who need saving. In light of these realities, giving thanks to God is both a gauge of our sanity and a reliable path to a greater measure of it. And who doesn’t want and need that? \n\nThird, giving thanks to God is not just a private affair, but is meant to be done before others and with others. Just as sharing our faith is meant to benefit others and glorify God, so giving thanks to God is meant to benefit others and glorify God. It benefits others by pointing them to the source of all joy and fulfillment, as we recount all the Lord has done. When we give thanks and praise to God, we are recommending Him to a watching world. We are saying God is worthy of our full acceptance and trust. \n\nIf I was a preacher, fond of alliteration, I could sum what it means to give thanks based on this verse as: a practice, a posture, and a proclamation. It flows out of who He is and who we are; it is heartfelt truth expressed for His benefit, for our benefit, and for the benefit of others. Keeping these three aspects of giving thanks in mind can help us grow in this crucial, beautiful grace.\n\nWritten by Matt Erickson\n\n                ",

Mary and Joseph obediently gave the child this name because an angel of the Lord visited Joseph in a dream and told him, “you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins” (Mt 1:21). \n\nScripture often combines the name Jesus with the Greek word for messiah, Christos, or “Christ.” The name “Jesus Christ” joins the two names in order to recognize Jesus as the anointed Savior. The New Testament keeps Jesus’s human name and His designation as the Christ linked after the resurrection, emphasizing that He remains fully man and fully God with all authority in heaven and on earth. \n\nEmphasis\n\nThe name of the incarnate Son of God\n\nReflection\n\nWhat does this name teach me about God?\n\n                ",

The word mashiach was translated into the Greek as christos, which is translated into English as “Christ.” “Messiah” and “Christ” are two titles that describe Jesus as the anointed, or chosen, one of Israel. \n\nThe word mashiach was used to describe someone who was anointed for a particular calling. In Scripture, people called to serve as prophets, priests, and kings were anointed with oil to ceremonially set them apart for their particular work.

When He prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane before His arrest, trial, and crucifixion, Jesus cried out, “Abba, Father,” using personal and relational names for God (Mk 14:36). Abba is an Aramaic word, from the Hebrew Ab, for “father.” Pater is the Greek word used for “father.” \n\nThese are deeply familial names when used to address God.

In John 10, Jesus calls Himself “the Good Shepherd.” He outlines His similar responsibilities: He lays down His life to protect His sheep, He gathers His sheep, and He speaks over His sheep.

God offered His name, God Almighty, as the guarantee of this improbable promise.

The name Elohim was paired with adjectives that describe the God of Israel. These two names, though different, are related. They are used to emphasize the unique nature of God: He is alive and greater than all others.  \n\nThe very notion of a living God distinguished Elohim from idols constructed of wood or iron. The Israelite God was—and is—living and active in and among His people. Similarly, the name “God Most High” elevates the God of Israel over all other gods.

All creation is subject to the LORD of Armies. “LORD of Hosts,” “God of Armies,” and “LORD God of Armies” are versions of this name.\n\n“LORD of Armies” most frequently appears in the Minor Prophets, especially in Malachi, where almost half of the verses in the book contain this name in some form.

The name carries a sense of nearness, including intimate knowledge of the needs, struggles, and hopes of humanity. When Isaiah prophesies about the virgin birth, he says that her child will be called Immanuel. This is not a proper name as much as it is a description of what the Messiah would be like. \n\nIn Matthew, an angel tells Joseph to name the child Jesus, because “He will save His people from their sins” (Mt 1:23).

Adonay is a reminder that we serve a holy, sovereign God who is Lord over all. \n\nKurios, or “lord” in the New Testament, was used to show respect to people with authority like emperors or masters. It is used to describe both God the Father and Jesus the Son in the New Testament. When followers of Jesus called Him “lord,” they showed Him honor. In Paul’s letters, he used the word as a title for the risen Jesus. “Lord Jesus Christ” became a primary way to refer to Him, implying He shared the authority of the God of Israel. Kurios is a powerful name of honor for Jesus. \n\nEmphasis\n\nA title of honor, respecting the authority and ruling power of God\n\nReflection\n\nWhat does this name teach me about God?\n\n                ",

It peeks up above my shirt collar just a little bit and my eye finds it most times when I look in the mirror. I have an affection for that scar. It reminds me of a time not long ago when my life was threatened by an infection in my heart, which required a team of surgeons to open me up and fix me.\n\nThe scar reminds me of how fragile life can be. It also reminds me of how resilient our bodies are. We were made to live. Death is a result of the fall, a consequence of sin. In my case, the doctors did their part, and then my body took over, working to put itself back together in a way that bore witness to the idea that we were created for life.\n\nWe come to the end of this Scripture reading plan focusing on a truth that is pretty difficult to get our minds and hearts around, but is nevertheless true and lies at the heart of—and is the entire point of—redemption. That truth is this: one day, every broken thing will be put right. There will be no more death. No more crying. No more sadness. No more suffering. No more injustice. No more betrayal. No more divorce. No more abuse. No more bacterial infections. No more need of doctors to cure them. \n\nI wonder if, in the new heavens and new earth, my body will bear the scar that runs down my chest. I don’t think it will be there on my glorified body, but what do I know? Here’s what I am confident about, though. The restoration of creation will be accomplished and secured by One who does bear scars—the risen Christ. He bore on His resurrected body the marks of Golgotha’s nails and the centurion’s spear. After the resurrection, He still bore the wounds into which Thomas placed his hand. He still bears the wounds by which we, and all creation, shall be healed. \n\nOne day all creation will be restored. The old order of things—this world of pain, suffering, and affliction—will pass away. But the idea is bigger than just the removal of struggle. When Christ restores His kingdom forever, it isn’t just that the sad things will go away. It’s that everything will be right. Creation itself will be restored completely and forever. The Lord will say, “Look, I am making everything new” (Revelation 21:5). This is where everything is headed, as sure as Christ has risen from the dead.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

I hate nothing more than someone saying they want to get together and talk, especially if it’s not something we do a lot. If we typically don’t go to lunch or get coffee and you ask me to go to lunch or get coffee with you, I can promise you I will spend most of my waking minutes leading up to said “talk” wondering what I have done to hurt your feelings or offend you. This time was no exception.\n\nFor days I wondered what I had done to deserve this. My heart and mind were in violent turmoil. I lost sleep. I constantly turned over various reasons for this meeting in my head. \n\nDid I criticize something he said and tell the wrong person?\nDid I write a blog that the elders are concerned about?\nDid I say something in a sermon that was wrong or offended someone? \n\nAnd then in a moment of clarity I’d tell myself I was being ridiculous. It was probably just coffee to catch up. But then— \n\nWhy not lunch? Why only coffee?\nMaybe he doesn’t want it to be long.\nMaybe he just wants to deliver a short, to-the-point rebuke with only a small investment of time and money.\n\nI couldn’t get any peace of mind until we met and I knew why he’d called this meeting.\n\nFinally the day came, the appointed hour arrived, aaaaaand… it was just coffee to catch up. That’s it. There was absolute peace between us, but I had been living for a number of days—what seemed like years—as if we were at odds. I had even tried to prepare ammunition for defense of the various fictional criticisms I assumed he would lodge in my direction. Sounds funny in the telling, I know, but I do this all the time, even with God. \n\nHere’s how it goes: Something bad will happen and I will immediately begin to question how God feels about me. I will doubt His love for me. I’ll assume He’s ticked off about some sin in my life—maybe one I’m completely unaware of—and then I’ll start to think, What is it between us?\n\nBut then I remember Paul’s words: “For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile everything to himself… by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross” (Colossians 1:19–20).\n\nI say “remember” because I tend to forget what’s true. I forget that regardless of what suffering I may be going through, even if it’s of my own making, God and I are at peace. I forget that while I still struggle with sin—even sin I’m unaware of—we are at peace.\n\nI am at peace with God, reconciled to Him, but not simply because He’s “nice.” God and I are at peace because peace has been bought for me through the blood His Son Jesus shed on the cross. That peace is unshakable and it cannot be altered. It is not dependent upon feelings, nor does it change with my actions—all the things I do or fail to do. It is as sure as Christ Himself. This peace is a fact, and it is a gift.\n\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I made a deal with my kids: “Put your dishes away after every meal for a week and I’ll give you a surprise.” Guess how long they made it? Not past breakfast on day one. I restarted the clock. We gave it another go. But on the last day, they were eager to play a game together as a family and left their cups on the table. So I took their cups to the sink for them and still gave them a surprise. Why? Because grace abounds.\n\nIn that moment with my kids, I saw a parable of the gospel. There is no amount of achieving or morality, church attending or evangelical rain-dancing in the spiritual disciplines that can get us into God’s grace. The only way we get into God’s grace is through God’s provision of grace. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life—and He Himself is the grace of God for us (John 14:6; Titus 2:11).\n\nReal Christianity is the message that salvation is always and only for undeserving sinners. Salvation is non-achievable—a complete gift of grace and mercy to sinners from the nail-pierced hands of Jesus Christ. \n\nDid you ask Him to go toe-to-toe with Satan in the wilderness for you?\nDid you ask Him to die for you back in 33 AD?\nDid you ask Him to rise from the dead, defeating sin and death for you? \n\nThe answer to all of the above is no. Jesus did all of this without you asking Him. Grace was coming for you before you were born, before you asked, and before you knew Him. Grace came for you.\n\nThere are a lot of competing voices in the world, but the real gospel rings out a simple message: You can be saved if you will give up trying to save yourself and abandon all other methods of salvation, believing in Christ alone. \n\nTrust His death for the death of your sins (Galatians 2:20). Trust that His stack of folded-up grave clothes means you’ve been clothed in garments of salvation and a robe of righteousness (Isaiah 61:10). Trust that the last set of sandal prints He left before He ascended back to the Father means that we will one day see Him face to face (1 Corinthians 13:12). His work on your behalf is your only hope. It is done. He has done it all. You are saved by grace, and by grace alone. \n\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    “Sorry, not sorry.”\n\nThis phrase has gained a firm grip on our culture by way of music and memes. Regardless of how it’s spun or who is doing the spinning, it’s always the bones of an apology minus any meat. In other words, it’s a skeleton phrase, nothing but a shell. “Look, I’m going to tell you ‘I’m sorry,’ but the truth of the matter is I’m not sorry at all.” And yes, it’s always accompanied by a rather carefree, if not defiant, attitude.\n\nWhile it may no doubt involve using the word “sorry,” there is something much deeper going on when the word “repentance” surfaces in Scripture. It is nothing if not a meaty word, impossible to spin.\n\n“Turn to me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning.\nTear your hearts, not just your clothes” (Joel 2:12-13).\n\nWhen it comes to repentance, tearing your clothes, whether literally or figuratively, could be involved. But that could also be nothing more than a “sorry, not sorry” stance. An empty gesture, merely a shell. God is crystal clear on the matter—empty gestures won’t fly. As they used to say, “Close, but no cigar.” \n\nRepentance is all in: a total turning of your mind, body, soul, and strength. You were headed in this direction, this way of thinking, this way of behaving, but now you’re turning the other way, the opposite of before. By all means if you need something tangible to symbolize your repentance, like tearing your clothes, do it. But more importantly, tear your heart and pray with the psalmist, “God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me” (Psalm 51:10).\n\nTear your heart. Sounds sorta harsh, doesn’t it? That’s probably because it sorta is, or at least it will feel that way. But stop and consider just who it is you’re turning to—the LORD your God. The psalmist describes our God with phrases like “faithful love” and “abundant compassion.” Words like these make Him sound sorta merciful, don’t they? That’s because He is; He’s merciful beyond our wildest imagination.   \n\nThe word “repent” unfortunately conjures up images of sweaty evangelists on street corners, pacing back and forth yelling hellfire and damnation messages to mostly disinterested crowds. But it is precisely the word that Jesus used when He came announcing the kingdom: “Repent.” But here’s the deal: Jesus didn’t stop with that one word, and what follows is what sets Him apart from any doomsday huckster. “Repent and believe the good news!” (Mark 1:15). \n\nThe only reason you and I would turn from this to that is because “that” is infinitely better, grander, and more beautiful. And He is. Jesus is.  \n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

But I only just realized this.\n\nRecently, my wife and I surprised our kids by taking them to the Humane Society. We’d seen a kitten on their website and thought he would be would be perfect for our family. But when we got there, we realized he had a twin brother. As we walked up to them we saw them playing together. Not having the heart to separate them, we left with two orange kittens, and before we even got home they had new names: Aslan and Judah.\n\nMy youngest did not like the name Aslan and was insistent we call him Buddy instead. You see, he did not know the story of Aslan. At nine years old, my son is not much of a reader. He prefers the outdoors and sports to books. So we decided to have a family movie night, complete with burgers and fries and peach cobbler, to watch The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and hopefully convince him that Aslan is indeed a good name.\n\nI know this story backwards and forwards. I’ve been reading it since fourth grade when my parents bought me the books. I’d read through them almost every other year growing up. But I noticed something new while watching the movie with him: It is an unlikely story.\n\nMy son knows that Aslan represents Jesus, and he knows the story of Jesus very well. But he was still surprised by Aslan’s death and the fact that he died to save Edmund. He actually kept asking us, “He is coming back, isn’t he?” as if he was worried Aslan would stay dead and the evil witch would win.\n\nIt was almost as if the story was so unlikely that it was hard to believe, even though he knew the story behind the story. The unlikeliness of the life, death, and resurrection of Aslan mirrored the very unlikeliness of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ.\n\nIn his letter to the Christians in Rome, the apostle Paul says, “For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly” (Romans 5:6). I often find this hard to believe, if I’m honest. Not on a factual level but on a personal level. I know how much like Edmund I am. I know the evil that resides in my heart. I know the betrayal I have shown toward the King. And so it seems unlikely that after living a perfect life, He would die to save me and then rise again to conquer death.\n\nIt all sounds so unlikely, but it’s a true story. And it’s the best news I’ve ever heard.\n\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

As it was getting dark, he ran behind the bus to explore, and I immediately thought, There’s no telling what’s back there. I’d better go get him. His two-year-old legs were pumping fast, but I caught up with him just in time. \n\nIt was so dark behind the bus we couldn’t see what was on the ground right in front of us. So I used the flashlight on my phone to light my son’s path as he ran and laughed in the dark—but I saw trouble. A pile of jagged chunks of concrete lay just a few tiny strides away, but my young son didn’t see it. I semi-lunged to grab him as he began to fall headfirst into a pile of hospital bills. I scooped him up, jumped over the concrete, tweaked my ankle on the landing, and told him, “Look at that, buddy. I just saved your life.”\n\nMy son couldn’t save himself. Forget the fact that he didn’t yet have the muscles or agility to avoid what he was barreling toward; he didn’t even know he had a problem. This is our twofold dilemma also. We don’t possess the power to remove ourselves out of the path of God’s wrath, out of the power of sin, or out of the ways of the world. And it doesn’t even register with us that we have a problem—until the Lord opens our eyes. \n\nWhen God shines the glorious light of the gospel through the person of Jesus Christ, that’s when we see. Our sins and their just judgment are illuminated, and we see there is hope in Christ alone. His death. His resurrection. His victory over our sin. Jesus rescues us from the damning dilemma. We can look to Christ with child-like faith and groan from our souls, “You saved my life.” \n\nIn this life the groaning never goes away completely. Our struggle with unbelief and and sin and weakness continues: ”We also groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies” (Romans 8:23). But as followers of Jesus we have been given His Spirit to remind us of the gospel and to help us pray as we wait for Him to make all things new.\n\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

Don’t get me wrong, I was brought up in a loving Christian home. I never lacked for food, clothing, shelter, education, or friendship. I am the fourth son of a Baptist minister, and so I was heavily involved in the life of the church. But really that was part of the problem, because out of everything I was afraid of, God was who I was afraid of the most.\n\nAfter walking down an aisle at the age of nine during an altar call, I repented of my sins and was baptized. But then I kept on sinning. And from my experience, sinning as a teenager feels much worse than sinning as a nine-year-old. There were sins I wanted to shake but could not. So I was afraid.\n\nI knew I was a sinner. That was clear to me. But I thought I was a sinner because I committed sins. At the time, I thought I was only battling against the individual sins we talked about in youth group, but it felt as if I was battling something outside of myself. So I continued to steel myself against threats in the shadows.\n\nI had it all wrong. My problem wasn’t that I was a sinner because I sinned. My problem was that I sinned because I am a sinner. I was shooting at my shadows when I really needed to be directing all my attention toward something deeply wrong inside of me.\n\nImagine going to a doctor with a gaping wound that is bleeding everywhere, the blood seeping through your clothes and onto the floor. But when the doctor finally arrives, instead of treating you, he looks at you and says, ”We really to need to clean up that blood.” This is how I used to think about my sin. I thought my actions were the problem, but really they were just symptoms. The real problem was rooted in my own heart.\n\nAs Jeremiah, the weeping prophet, writes, “The heart is more deceitful than anything else, and incurable—who can understand it?” (Jeremiah 17:9). Learning this was revolutionary for me. I was good at repenting and wanting to fight against sins I was struggling with. But my pastor explained that, in the midst of my internal struggle and my repentance, I needed to believe the gospel. He helped me to see the fullness of the good news: Jesus not only justifies us, He also sanctifies us, making us more and more like Him as we trust Him to change us. \n\nI was laboring under the delusion that I was justified by grace and sanctified by gritting my teeth and trying to become more holy. But the problem of my sin runs far too deep for that. I cannot work my way into righteousness. It seems so counterintuitive, but once I realized this truth—that my heart is the problem—I was able to turn to God in thankful desperation and repent. What’s more, I found it easier to say “no” to sin. And it wasn’t because I’d become a better person. No, when I saw the depth of my sin, I saw more clearly the beauty of the gospel.

Everything was going along so well in the first two chapters of the Bible’s first book. God’s voice said, “Let there be light!” and that singular domino tipped the other elements of creation, causing an explosion of life in all its stunning wonder—from fruit trees to great sea monsters, to male and female in His own image, complete with a garden to hold everything on display. And the divine verdict on it all? Very good.\n\n“Eden. With, of course, its serpent. No Eden valid without serpent.” — Wallace Stegner\n\nFree will. It was at the core of the very good creation. The God-ordained freedom to choose. And into the gift of that freedom slithered the most cunning of all the wild animals the LORD God had made. The serpent’s voice said, “Did God really say…?” and that singular question was just enough to root doubt in the mind of the woman and man. God had given them the world, so to speak, yet the serpent suggested there might be something more.\n\n“God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God…” (Genesis 3:5).\n\nWith her God-given freedom the woman took and ate what God had deemed off-limits. Then the man, in that same freedom, took and ate as well. And no doubt with juice still on their hands, their eyes were opened. Sin and all its dark consequences snaked into the world: shame, pain in childbirth, and work by the sweat of the brow—just to name a few. Humanity rebelled against God, “turned their backs on him” (Isaiah 1:4), and the beautiful melody of Eden was broken. \n\nAnd yet it is worth noting that while the serpent was cursed, the man and woman were not. They would indeed bear the burdens of the curse, but they themselves were not. Even as it looked like all was lost, something else stirred in the ruins, something that was very good. The hope of the Coming One.    \n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The Mona Lisa is one of the most famous paintings in the world. Crowds herd their way through the Louvre in Paris to catch a glimpse of Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece. Guinness World Records lists the Mona Lisa as having the highest insured value for a painting, assessed at $100 million in 1962. That’s about $600 million today. But how much do you think a print of the Mona Lisa fetches? Peanuts. You can get one on Amazon for $7. \n\nSo why the canyon-sized price difference between the art hanging in Paris and the copy hanging in your local coffee shop? One is a work created by the artist himself; the other by a laser printer.\n\nDo you realize the masterpiece of the Artist of artists is you? The Almighty God knit you together in your mother’s womb (Psalm 139:13). Every human—regardless of race or age or gender—has this same inherent worth and dignity because they have been made in the image of the one true God (Genesis 1:27).\n\nWe image, or reflect, certain attributes of God—love, mercy, kindness, community, grace—because God has made us to be like Him, to proclaim Him, to spread His glory. While lions, eagles, and breathtaking mountains are wonders of creation, none of them compare to the glory of a baby who is just discovering her nose, or an elderly man teaching his grandson how to fish. Every person you meet matters. They matter to God, and they should matter to you and to me. \n\nThe principalities and powers of this present age continually tempt us to deny the truth that we are made in God’s image. Gossip, slander, sexism, racism, assault, and all forms of abuse are attacks on the value and dignity all human beings have by virtue of being made in the image of God. The incarnate Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth, makes God known to us in all His perfection. Where we fail as image-bearers, Christ succeeds, redeems, and makes new in the work of the gospel. \n\nIf people made in God’s image are of more worth than a sparrow—and Jesus says they are—and the Lord knows when even one sparrow falls to the ground—and He does—then He certainly values you more than can you imagine (Luke 12:6–7). The truth is you and everyone you meet is infinitely more valuable than the $600 million Mona Lisa. Let’s love and honor one another according to the sky-high price tag God attaches to people made in His image.\n\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I remember when I first understood the gospel. It was January 21, 1989, at around 7:30 p.m., in a small retreat center in rural Indiana. I was fifteen years old, in love with the pastor’s daughter, and new to the youth group. I had grown up around the church since I was in kindergarten, but Christianity was something my parents were involved with. As their son, I was along for the ride.\n\nBut at a youth group retreat in the frozen fields of the midwest, I heard the gospel and it took hold of me. I knew my life was going to be transformed by the simple yet profound message of God’s mercy and grace given through the sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus.\n\nThe gospel follows a basic four-part trajectory: creation, fall, redemption, and restoration. God created the world and human beings as good. We rebelled against Him, breaking our relationship and falling away. The only way for that relationship to be redeemed would be for us to somehow live up to God’s perfect standard of holiness, which we could not do. So God sent His Son to live in our place, pay the wages of sin on our behalf through His death, and defeat the power of death by rising from the grave. Jesus lived the life we’ve all failed to live, died the death we all deserve to die, and offers His perfect record of righteousness as our substitute, restoring us to our Creator forever.\n\nToday’s scriptures focus on the beginning: creation. God made this world and everything in it. And what He made was good. There was a time when things like sickness and death, deception and decay, betrayal and grief and greed had not entered into the heart of man. And the promise of the gospel is that there will come a day when those things will be done away with forever. But for now, we all live with the ache in our hearts that longs for everything that is broken to be made right. We feel this way because we were created to live in a world that is unbroken and untouched by sin. Today’s scriptures speak to that.\n\nI have much to learn and I’m far from perfect, but my life has been transformed by the truths you will read in this reading plan. Millions of others around the world and throughout history share the same story. The gospel, as the apostle Paul says, is the transforming power of God for those who believe (Romans 12:2). I pray your time in these verses from God’s Word would encourage, clarify, and transform according to the Lord’s perfect will for your life. May He do the same in me.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Horatio Spafford was a Christian businessman and investor who lived in Chicago in the 1870s. Prior to writing this hymn, Spafford suffered several seasons of great loss, grief, and deep darkness. \n\nThe first tragedy to strike his family was the loss of his two-year-old son, which in its own right, would have been enough to break a man. Right on the heels of this loss, and in the midst of great grief, Spafford suffered another blow as his home city was ravaged by the Great Chicago Fire. This not only caused great social and economic chaos, but it personally destroyed Spafford financially; he had invested nearly all of his wealth into Chicago real estate and development. \n\nIn an effort to find rest and reprieve, and perhaps to collect his thoughts, Spafford planned a summer trip for his family to Europe. Maybe this would provide a change of scenery and a time of healing. At the last minute, however, Spafford was unable to board the vessel SS Ville du Havre with his wife, Anna, and their four daughters. He was needed stateside for a business matter, so he sent his family ahead with the intention to join them soon. \n\nAs Spafford was working to salvage the wreckage that was his business, he received word of nearly unspeakable tragedy: SS Ville du Havre had shipwrecked. On November 21, 1873, the liner was rammed amid ship by a British vessel and sank within minutes. Anna was picked up unconscious on a floating spar, but the four children had drowned. Apparently, when Spafford did finally receive notice of the events, it was accompanied by a two-word telegram from Anna which read, “Saved alone…”  \n\nSaved alone. Saved alone. Saved alone. \n\nI imagine these words must’ve run through Spafford’s mind thousands of times as he beat his breast and poured out his soul, weeping before God. How could this be? How could this possibly be? God, where were you? Why God, why? \n\nAs Spafford crossed the Atlantic, heading to console and grieve with his beloved Anna, he began to write, fervently pouring out his heart to God. Many think he took pen to page near the spot where the ship’s passengers breathed their last.  \n\nWhen peace like a river attendeth my way\nWhen sorrows like sea billows roll\nWhatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say\n“It is well, it is well, with my soul.”\n\nIt’s hard to learn of Spafford’s story and to encounter his hymn, his prayers, his cries before the Most High, and not be utterly moved. \n\nChrist promised that in this world we would suffer (John 16:33). Some of us may look at Spafford’s story and pray that we never encounter such a shipwreck. Others among us feel they already have. Some are experiencing peace, some great turmoil like the rolling waves of a storm-swept sea. The marvelous mystery of the gospel is wrapped up in a spirit that is able to praise God in the midst of all circumstances. It’s here that Spafford humbly and beautifully leads the way. \n\nWe serve a God who is able to walk on water and calm the waves—but He can also lead us through the storm (Matthew 14:22–23; 8:23–27). Whatever our lot, whatever our challenge or trial or resistance, when we pray “it is well,” we don’t brush away the pain or despair, but we do plant our feet firmly on the Rock that is steady and with us in the storm and suffering. “It is well” is not a glib smile or a trite phrase. It’s the knowledge that Jesus, who wept for the loss of His friend, also weeps with us in our loss (John 11:35), ministering to us from His personal experience with great suffering. \n\n“Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river… as one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem” (Isaiah 66:12-13a).\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\nIt Is Well With My Soul\nHoratio G. Spafford, 1873\n\nWhen peace like a river attendeth my way,\nwhen sorrows like sea billows roll;\nwhatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,\n“It is well, it is well with my soul.”\n\nIt is well with my soul;\nit is well, it is well with my soul.\n\nThough Satan should buffet, though trials should come,\nlet this blest assurance control:\nthat Christ has regarded my helpless estate,\nand has shed His own blood for my soul.    \n\nMy sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!\nMy sin, not in part, but the whole,\nis nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more;\npraise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!   \n\nO Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,\nthe clouds be rolled back as a scroll;\nthe trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend;\neven so, it is well with my soul.   \n\n     ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    My great-grandmother recently passed away at the age of 93. She was a stalwart in our family—a steady, consistent matriarch for my entire life, up until that point. When she passed away, it felt like gravity was removed from our family. My grandmother, in particular, took it extremely hard, going through a period of darkness that one would expect from someone who has just lost her mother.\n\nThe funeral was held on Good Friday, not really by design but by beautiful happenstance. I told the preacher beforehand that there would be less than five Christians in the audience, so I wanted him to bring the gospel in full force. He said, “How could I not on today of all days?” His sermon was rich with hope and encouragement that death is not the end for those who believe in Christ, but rather the beginning of eternal and unmitigated joy.\n\nOur hymn today is a wonderful reminder of this truth. “Only a few more trials, Only a few more tears!” it says. Though pain and suffering and temptation and death are knocking at our door, we are safe. \n\nSafe in the arms of Jesus\nSafe from corroding care\nSafe from the world’s temptations\nSin cannot harm [us] there.\n\nAt the end of the Bible, in Revelation 21–22, we are told that there will be no more sin or pain or death when Jesus returns. Though we are surely safe and secure in His arms today, there will come a day when we will no longer need safety from these things, for sin will be no more, and all of its effects will be cast into the lake of fire (v.14).\n\nThis is a message of hope for us weary travelers. On the road Jesus has marked out for us, we take detours and side roads, wandering back and forth between lanes like exhausted coal miners on our way home from a day’s labor. But at the end of the road stands our Savior, there to take on every impurity and doubt and trial we carry on our backs. “Only a few more trials, only a few more tears” before He returns to make all things new.

After knowing Steph for fifteen years, and being married to her for thirteen, I have an entirely different perspective on Brussels sprouts. I enjoy them. I order them at restaurants. I willing put them on my plate when they are prepared and presented at a meal. My love for Stephanie has changed my attitude for Brussels sprouts because love changes things. \n\nWhile my palette and love for food have changed and grown out of my love for my wife, a stronger love has changed me in much deeper and eternal ways. Charles Wesley’s hymn “Love Divine, All Loves Excelling” describes this love, pointing us to the source and power of true and lasting change in our lives: the all-surpassing love of God. \n\nThe way we, as men, usually seek to bring about change in our spheres of influence is very different. When facing a particular temptation, we try to exert our will to overcome our temptation through strength and discipline. When we want to motivate our children to different behavior (e.g., “STOP JUMPING ON THE COUCH!”) we tend to rely on threats and, sometimes, punitive measures. In our work environments, change comes through strategy, performance reviews, and leveraging financial benefits. Earthly change is the result of power, law, and judgment. \n\nGod, however, doesn’t seek to change us by force of might or a heavy hand laid upon our back. Each person of the Trinity involves Himself in pouring out an incomparable, excelling love to change us. Jesus, the “joy of heav’n” Wesley writes about, has come to us in His incarnation, full of compassion to take our place and punishment for our sin. The Spirit breathes life into us, those who were once spiritually dead, indwelling us and changing us throughout the course of our entire lives. The Father pours out His acceptance, never to cast out again. The trajectory of the love of the Father, Son, and Spirit is to bring us to completion—holy, blameless, and glorious in Him.\n\nLove is what changes us. The more we rely on and gaze upon God’s great love for us, the more we are changed. Today, brothers, let us not seek to change ourselves by power, law, and might. We need to be changed by the love of God. His love is incomparable, far deeper and stronger than any other love. Let’s fuel our hearts for change today with the love that surpasses all other loves.\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol \n\nLove Divine, All Loves Excelling\nText: Charles Wesley, 1747\n\nLove divine, all loves excelling,\njoy of heav’n, to earth come down,\nfix in us Thy humble dwelling;\nall Thy faithful mercies crown.\nJesus, Thou art all compassion;\npure, unbounded love Thou art;\nvisit us with Thy salvation;\nenter ev’ry trembling heart.\n\nBreathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit\ninto ev’ry troubled breast!\nLet us all in Thee inherit;\nlet us find the promised rest.\nTake away the love of sinning;\nAlpha and Omega be;\nend of faith, as its beginning,\nset our hearts at liberty.\n\nCome, Almighty, to deliver;\nlet us all Thy life receive;\nsuddenly return and never,\nnevermore Thy temples leave.\nThee we would be always blessing,\nserve Thee as Thy hosts above,\npray and praise Thee without ceasing,\nglory in Thy perfect love.\n\nFinish then Thy new creation;\npure and spotless let us be;\nlet us see Thy great salvation\nperfectly restored in Thee.\nChanged from glory into glory,\ntill in heav’n we take our place,\ntill we cast our crowns before Thee,\nlost in wonder, love, and praise\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    “Be Thou My Vision” is one of the oldest and most beloved hymns in all of Christendom. Though there are numerous reasons why this is a favorite for so many believers, I suspect that—apart from the melodic tune—the chief reason has to do with the way in which the songwriter wed theological and devotional lyrics into a prayer. \n\nTransliterated into English prose by Mary E. Byrne in 1905, this melodic Celtic prayer focuses those singing it on the all-sufficiency of God. Much as the psalmist frequently enumerated the multitude of ways that God was his all-sufficient portion and defense, “Be Thou My Vision” gives the worshipper words to refocus his or her mind and heart to the greatness of the true and living God. And with the recurrent use of the first-person pronoun “my” within the hymn, we see how these lyrics intimated a personal relationship between Byrne and God—between the believing worshipper and the only God worthy of our worship. He is our vision, wisdom, true Word, battle shield, sword, inheritance, and treasure. \n\nThe hymn writer beautifully highlights the all-sufficiency of God by contrasting all of who He is with those earthly things that so often compete for our hearts. As the Apostle Paul said to the Philippians, everything is “a loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus [our] Lord” (3:8). Whether it is earthly relations, wisdom, or riches, our God is the true Father, true wisdom, and true riches to the souls of believers. \n\nThe one singing this hymn from the heart to God is acknowledging a desire to relinquish earthly pleasures and gains expressed. How often we need to be reminded that the Living God is better than all of the passing pleasures and experiences of life in this fallen world! “Thou, and Thou only, first in my heart/great God of heaven, my treasure Thou art.”\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\nBe Thou My Vision\nText: Irish hymn, sixth century\nProse Translation: Mary Byrne, 1905\nVerse Form:  Eleanor H.

This verse is easy to utter, but when life becomes excruciatingly painful, it is difficult to believe. Even so, saints throughout history would attest to the truth that when life is bitter, Christ is sweeter still.\n\nMost likely, you don’t recognize the name Louisa Stead. However, if you’ve spent considerable time in a local church, it is possible that you’ve joined the chorus in singing her hymn, “‘Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus.” Written over a century ago, it is a simple, yet powerful, hymn of faith. Understanding Stead’s story sweetens the words of this precious hymn even more.\n\nIn 1875, Louisa married and gave birth to one daughter, Lilly. When their child was only four years old, the family was vacationing on the shores of Long Island when their lives were abruptly changed forever. There on the beach, Louisa and Lilly watched their beloved husband and father drown while attempting to rescue a boy from the waters of the sea. With no way to financially support themselves after Mr. Stead’s death, Louisa and Lilly were left in poverty.\n\nThe depth of sorrow experienced in the unexpected death of a spouse has to be unimaginable. The depth of despair in facing the uncertainties of poverty must be crushing. But in the bleakest moments of life, it seems that God’s grace shines most brightly.\n\nIt was out of this personal tragedy that the words of this classic hymn were penned. As the newly widowed Mrs. Stead walked through the darkness of loss, it was by God’s grace that she persevered in her faith and plunged beneath His healing, cleansing flood of mercy.\n\nOne can imagine the questions that must have come to mind after the initial grief of this loss began to settle, perhaps the most difficult of those being, “Why?” While she may not have received the answer this side of heaven, Louisa did receive comfort in her pain.

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest (Matthew 11:28).”\n\nChrist’s offer of rest for the weary is one of the most comforting promises in all of Scripture. When we find ourselves with nothing, worn out and hopeless, He is there, offering the rest our souls need. But what about when life seems to be going well, and yet we still feel heavy-ladened and burdened? Elizabeth Akers’s hymn, “Come, Oh, Come to Me,” is a rich reminder of the comfort we have in Christ at all times, engaging us where we so often are, “lingering, waiting for some better time.” \n\nWhy do we linger?\nWhy are we so reluctant to come to Him?\nWhat is it that keeps us waiting? \n\nI believe that Christ certainly offers rest and comfort in seasons of hardship and emptiness. But He brings us near not merely to free us from pain, but to free us from our idols. What does it mean to be heavy-ladened and burdened? It means to be weary of the world and all it offers, to be tired of empty promises and trifling thrills.\n\nBut of course, we are often slow to tire of the world. We cling to visions of success and luxury, of excitement and acclaim, of relaxation and pleasure, ignoring the fact that none of these truly satisfy. Or we linger because we are afraid, though we ought to remember His promise: “They will come with weeping, but I will bring them back with consolation” (Jeremiah 31:9). We may even tarry because we still love our comforts, and even our sins, more than we love Christ. We huddle with and cling to our idols, reluctant to come to Jesus until we’ve tried them all and tired of them. What must we be weary of in order to turn to Christ? \n\nWe must tire of our wanderings, and grow weary of the world.\n\nHow great is His kindness toward us that, though we wait so long and make so many excuses, still He calls us gently, patiently. He is “lowly and humble in heart,” as C.S. Lewis observed in his book, The Problem of Pain. “He is not proud.” Lewis continues, “He stoops to conquer, He will have us even though we have shown that we prefer everything else to Him.”\n\nOh what a Savior is Christ, to offer us His rest, love, joy, blessing, and freedom when we are so slow to turn to Him. Let us cast away our idols, for Christ beckons us. May Christ so move in us that we run to Him for rest. If you know Christ, do not cling to the offerings of this tired old world, but rest in His promises. If you do not know Christ, “today He’s calling, come and claim Him thine!”\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\nCome, Oh, Come to Me\nText: Lizzie Akers, 1902\nTune: James M. Black, 1902 \n\nWeary burdened wand’rer,\nthere is rest for thee,\nat the feet of Jesus,\nin His love so free;\nlisten to His message,\nwords forever blest,\noh, thou heavy laden,\n“Come to Me and rest.”\n\n“Come, oh come to Me,\ncome, oh come to Me,”\nJesus now is waiting, calling\n“Come, oh come to Me.”\n\nBring Him all thy burdens,\nall thy guilt and sin,\nmercy’s door is open,\nrise and enter in.\nJesus there is waiting,\npatiently for thee,\nhear Him gently calling,\n“Come, oh, come to Me.”  \n\nLinger then no longer,\ncome just now to Him;\nere the shadows gather,\nand thy light grows dim.\nThou hast long been waiting\nfor some better time,\nbut today He’s calling,\ncome and claim Him thine.  \n\nHe will bid thee welcome,\nat the blessed cross,\nturn to joy thy mourning,\nturn to gold thy dross.\nHe will lead thee gently,\nall along the way,\nin the path that shineth,\nunto perfect day.  \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Several years ago, my wife wanted to get backyard chickens, and I fought it. I thought the idea was crazy. We live in the city—in the suburbs. Chickens? Really? But she wore me down. And it’s been one of the best parenting decisions we’ve ever made. Our kids love them. They’ve named them. And through feeding them, collecting their eggs, and scooping up their poop, my daughters have learned all kinds of things about daily responsibility.\n\nOne of the most significant experiences with owning chickens came on the day a dog jumped our back fence and killed two of our hens. My daughters’ hearts were broken. I disposed of the bodies, and that night we had a chicken funeral. We went around the dinner table, each sharing our favorite memories of Rebekah and Matilda. We’re not the most sentimental family, but we still grieved. I can remember sitting on the bed that evening with my youngest while she cried. She needed her dad to help her find rest. \n\nA mentor of mine once told me, “Life is full of unfinished symphonies.” It’s true. In this fallen world, things are always falling apart. We face cancer, lost jobs, and disability. Hopes and dreams are deferred. Loved ones die. But even when we feel life’s brokenness more than we’ve ever felt it before, God is still with us. We can patiently bear our cross of grief and pain, because He is on our side. \n\nJesus calls us to come to Him with our griefs and fears. He wants to bear our burdens and quiet our souls. When I feel anxious, grieved, and oppressed, my tendency is either to run to my friends or to make myself busy in order to distract myself from worry. This isn’t wrong, but Psalm 62 reminds me of my need to first bring my griefs to my Father, just as my little girl brought hers to me. We find true rest in God alone; our hope comes from Him. People and things will always let us down, but God remains faithful.\n\nThis can be hard to trust when we experience loss and injustice. (I mean, sometimes we just want to be mad at the neighbors’ dog!) We can’t always trace out what God is doing, but we know that He orders and provides. Rest and hope are found in remembering His power and providence over all of life’s storms (Luke 8:22-25). One day, He’ll show us the end of the symphony He’s been writing for us. He’ll correct the prevailing forms of injustice we experience in this world. And for His people, Jesus will repay—from His own fullness—all that was previously taken away (Isaiah 61:3).\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\nBe Still, My Soul\nOriginal Text: Katrina von Schlegel, 1752\nTranslation: Jane Borthwick, 1855\n\nBe still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side.\nBear patiently the cross of grief or pain.\nLeave to thy God to order and provide;\nin ev’ry change, He faithful will remain.\nBe still, my soul: thy best, thy heav’nly Friend\nthrough thorny ways leads to a joyful end.\n\nBe still, my soul: thy God doth undertake\nto guide the future, as He has the past.\nThy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;\nall now mysterious shall be bright at last.\nBe still, my soul: the waves and winds still know\nHis voice, Who ruled them while He dwelt below.\n\nBe still, my soul: when dearest friends depart,\nand all is darkened in the veil of tears,\nthen shalt thou better know His love, His heart,\nwho comes to soothe thy sorrow and thy fears.\nBe still, my soul: thy Jesus can repay\nfrom His own fullness all He takes away.\n\nBe still, my soul: the hour is hast’ning on\nwhen we shall be forever with the Lord.\nWhen disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,\nsorrow forgot, love’s purest joys restored.\nBe still, my soul: when change and tears are past,\nall safe and blessed we shall meet at last.\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    This past fall, my father-in-law helped my wife build a raised garden bed. Neither Susie nor I really consider ourselves proficient gardeners, but we aspire to be. Susie’s Macedonian grandmother has tended a substantial garden of vegetables since she came to the States in the early 20th century. Having a backyard garden has always been a dream of mine. This spring, we’ve planted our first set of crops in the small garden, and Susie has been diligently watering them regularly.\n\nPlanting a garden and tending it for the first time has given me new perspective on Jesus’s image of abiding in Him, just as branches are connected to a vine. The way a branch needs its root or its vine points us to our dependence upon Christ.\n\n“Abide With Me” was written and set to a tune in the 19th century, and it is a hymn not of praise or of triumph, but of deep need and desperation. Henry Francis Lyte writes, “When other helpers fall and comforts flee/Help of the helpless, O abide with me.” At various times in life, we will find ourselves walking through valleys that resemble David’s heart in Psalm 23. We may feel abandoned by people. We may feel as though everything that may bring joy has been ripped away. We may be tempted to forsake God in anger, but that is not the solution.\n\nThe solution is to cling closer to Christ when we feel abandoned and alone. As Lyte states later in the hymn: “O Thou who changest not, abide with me/I need Thy presence every passing hour.” We must trust that God will be faithful to us and fulfill His promises to us. Numbers 23:19 reminds us, “God is not a man, that he might lie, or a son of man, that he might change his mind. Does he speak and not act, or promise and not fulfill?”\n\nWhen we are trudging through seasons of life questioning the goodness or the presence of God, it can be difficult to lift our eyes to heaven and have any sort of affection or trust in our heavenly Father. When it seems as if an all-powerful God isn’t protecting us the way we think He should, we often misunderstand it as hatred or ignorance on His part.\n\nInstead, when we walk through trials and periods of desperation, we must see these valleys as opportunities to cling to Christ when all other distractions and comforts have been stripped away. We must turn to the One who will not remove His presence from us, the One who continues to abide with us.\n\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\nAbide with Me\nText: Henry Francis Lyte, 1847\nTune: William H. Monk, 1861\n\nAbide with me: fast falls the eventide;\nthe darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.\nWhen other helpers fail and comforts flee,\nHelp of the helpless, O abide with me\n\nSwift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;\nearth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away.\nChange and decay in all around I see.\nO Thou who changest not, abide with me.\n\nI need Thy presence every passing hour.\nWhat but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?\nWho like Thyself my guide and strength can be?\nThrough cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.\n\nI fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless,\nills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.\nWhere is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?\nI triumph still, if Thou abide with me.\n\nHold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes.\nShine through the gloom and point me to the skies.\nHeaven’s morning breaks and earth’s vain shadows flee;\nin life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Near the close of Cormac McCarthy’s book No Country for Old Men, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell talked with his elderly uncle about how the world was changing. During the conversation, his uncle said something that encapsulated the guilt many men struggle with. He said, “I always thought when I got older that God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn’t. I don’t blame him. If I was him I’d have the same opinion about me that he does.” \n\nFew books of the Bible carry a darker backdrop than that of Jeremiah. God’s people will be defeated on their own land and carried off into exile. This will happen to them, not purely as a result of outside influence, but primarily because the people broke faith with the Lord and violated His covenant with them. \n\nChapter 8 describes Jeremiah’s heartbroken lamentation at the sin of the people. He asks if there is no balm in Gilead. He metaphorically refers to a mountainous area east of the Jordan River known for a healing ointment made from the resin of a tree. The people have a deep wound and ample cleansing is available to them, but they will not avail themselves of it. They need to repent, but they refuse (Jeremiah 8:18-22).\n\nWe understand the pain of Jeremiah’s desperate cry. Every man knows the pain created by our own sins. Our sexual brokenness damages our souls and can leave destruction in its wake. Our penchant for selfishness breaks relationships with those closest to us. Our frustrated ambitions create bitterness and envy in our souls. Too often, we confess a belief in God’s grace while harboring doubts about whether it really applies to us. We wonder if God could still love us, keep us in His family, and hear our prayers. Every one of us knows what it is like to have a “sin-sick soul.”\n\nWhile Jeremiah asked if there was balm in Gilead, the traditional spiritual reminds us that on this side of the cross, the question turns into a declaration. Because of Christ, we no longer have to wonder if we are loved, if we have hope, or if there is healing for our tired and weary souls. Jesus took our sins, our guilt, and our shame upon Himself. He died on that tree to heal our sin-sick souls and bring us back to God.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\nThere Is A Balm in Gilead\n\nTraditional Spiritual\n\nThere is a balm in Gilead\nto make the wounded whole,\nthere is a balm in Gilead\nto heal the sin-sick soul.\n\nSometimes I feel discouraged\nand think my work’s in vain,\nbut then the Holy Spirit\nrevives my soul again.\n\nThere is a balm in Gilead\nto make the wounded whole,\nthere is a balm in Gilead\nto heal the sin-sick soul.\n\nIf you cannot preach like Peter,\nif you cannot pray like Paul,\nyou can tell the love of Jesus\nand say, “He died for all.” \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    We have a Savior. We, the guilty, helpless, and lost ones who have rebelled against God, have a Savior. We, who have broken faith with His commands and sought to love ourselves more than we love Him, have a Savior.\n\nThink about that for a moment. We begin this short reading plan focused on hope-filled hymns and Scriptures celebrating the fact that we have a Savior.\n\nBut what kind of Savior is He?\n\nIsaiah 53 tells us Jesus is the servant of the Lord who was, in every way, ordinary in appearance. His birth was like a root out of dry ground—unnoticed by almost everyone. He had no beauty that would draw people to Him. He would not walk an easy road. His life would be filled with sorrow. He would be despised (vv.1–3).\n\nBut Jesus came to be our “Man of Sorrows,” taking our grief upon Himself and carrying our sadness. Yes, people caused Him great suffering in His last days, but they were not the ones to crush Him. God was the One who did that. Jesus was wounded for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. And the punishment that would bring us peace was laid upon Him (vv. 4–6).\n\nGuilty, helpless, lost were we;\nblameless Lamb of God was He,\nsacrificed to set us free:\nHallelujah, what a Savior!\n\nJesus willingly submitted to His Father’s plan. As the full weight of God’s wrath toward the sins of His people was placed upon our Savior, Jesus received it. When He could have defended Himself, He stayed silent, like a lamb led to slaughter. He was struck dead as a sacrifice for the sins of God’s people, even though He had done no violence. \n\nGod laid upon His servant the iniquity of His people. Jesus took God’s wrath toward our sins upon Himself. He stood in for us as our substitute in death, and God looked upon this substitution and was satisfied. \n\nGod did not perform a magic trick to secure our salvation. It was a life for a life. The Suffering Servant—God’s only begotten Son, Jesus Christ—came incarnate as a living, breathing man in order to die a real death in our place. But since death held no claim on Him, He rose from the grave, securing our victory over death forever. \n\nThis is our Savior. What other response should our hearts have but to sing, “Hallelujah!

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    This past Easter, my children found one of those memes showing a picture of Jesus’ tomb with the words “JK. BRB. -JC” written underneath it. That’s “Just kidding. Be right back. -Jesus Christ” for those who don’t speak emoji or meme. We all laughed at the joke, but I told them this sort of thing makes me really uncomfortable. Here’s why.\n\nIt isn’t that I think there’s no place for humor in the Easter story. I think there is. I laugh every time I read Pilate telling the Sanhedrin, “You have a guard of soldiers. Go and make the tomb as secure as you know how” (Mt 27:65). I think that line is meant to be funny.\n\nMy discomfort comes from how cavalier we can be with the things of God. We treat God with a sort of familiarity that leads us to describe Jesus as our buddy. We treat the Creator as though He is in on our joke. That’s the part that makes me uncomfortable. \n\nWe conclude this study of psalms for prayer with a messianic psalm—a psalm that points to the ministry of Jesus. Today’s psalm is a great antidote to an irreverent, casual way of thinking about and praying to God. It is a psalm that celebrates the gift of Jesus, and it does so by focusing on His power and glory. It is meant to draw from us both joy and fear.\n\nThis psalm predicts the coming of the Anointed One, against whom the nations will rage and plot in vain (Ps 2:2). It foreshadows Jesus’ baptism, when the Holy Spirit came to rest on the Lord as He stood in the Jordan River and a voice from heaven said, “This is my son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to Him” (Ps 2:7; Mt 3:17). It calls worshipers to serve the Lord with reverence and awe because of His unmatched power (Ps 2:10-12).\n\nAs we thank the Father for the gift of the Son, the proper posture is not to come with jokes, memes, and clever observations. It is to come with “reverential awe and rejoice with trembling.” Why? Because the Jesus to whom we pray broke the power of sin and death by taking our guilt and dying the death we deserved to die. And every sad thing in our lives, every trouble that breaks our hearts, every pain that brings us low, every injustice that keeps our world divided, every catastrophe that indiscriminately wipes image bearers of God off the face of the earth will yield to His power and will cease to exist. For all eternity. World without end. Amen.\n\nSo with reverence and awe, thank God for the gift of His Son, our Lord, Jesus Christ—the Holy and Anointed One of God.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    In the 1989 film Say Anything, Lloyd Dobler (played by John Cusack) stands outside Diane Court’s window with a boombox playing a love song, hoping to win her over. This scene has become iconic; I’m sure you’ve either seen it or a parody of it.\n\nDiane is the school’s valedictorian and Lloyd is, well, not. Even so, the movie centers on their budding, though unlikely, relationship. In an attempt to win her love once and for all—after failing to be able to buy her an expensive gift—Lloyd stands outside her window in that classic scene, stereo above his head. In a sense, he’s showing her that he’s willing to humble himself to the point of standing outside her window to profess his love, even if the world is watching.\n\nSometimes it can feel a little humbling to be part of the Church when the world is watching. We’re an awkward and flawed bunch. But the Church is one of God’s best gifts to the world—a place where His people are called to dwell together in unity. Today’s psalm is a prayer celebrating the gift of the Church, because God’s people don’t just dwell together, we live together with Him. \n\nIn today’s reading, the psalmist says, “I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God than live in the tents of wicked people” (Psalm 84:10). For the psalmist, standing outside God’s window is better than being under the seemingly safe cover of his enemies’ tents. His love and trust for the Lord supersedes his own comfort and desires. He knows that being part of the people of God is better by far than being alone. \n\nThe psalmist cries out to the Lord, trusting that He is good and that joy can be found nowhere else. He wants to be nowhere else but in the house of the Lord, among the people of the Lord. In fact, he’d be willing to stand outside with a boombox over is head, rather than try to find comfort anywhere else. Better is one day with God than with anyone else, anywhere else. \n\nLoving the Lord is not merely a love story, where God always plays hard to get, and we try to win Him over and gain His affection. Through the death and resurrection of Christ, we are already loved and already welcomed into His house. We are His children, and therefore, we will never be homeless.\n\nMay we walk in this faith today, regardless of our trials and tribulations, giving thanks that God does not call us to live out our faith alone. As we have seen and will continue to see, the psalms are full of prayers that express joy and frustration, fear and hope, and everything in between. But because our God loves us unconditionally and lends His ear to our sorrows, we can know that there is no better place than in His house, as His children, together resting in the grace of our Father.\n\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    We all trust in others. We are all hurt by others, even those we adore. And even though people trust in us, we hurt others as well. It doesn’t matter how close the relationship is; there is always the possibility of letting someone down or being let down. The reality is, none of us is able to be everything to everyone. Perfect faithfulness is a burden too heavy to be carried by human shoulders. \n\nIn a broken world full of broken people, where can we turn for perfect faithfulness? Who will perfectly love us even though we, too, are unfaithful? \n\nIn Psalm 146, we are reminded that God alone is the refuge for all generations. He remains faithful forever. When spouses fail, God is faithful. When friends fail, God is faithful. When governments fail, God is faithful. When all mortals and moral establishments fail, the sovereign God is faithful. When we ourselves are unfaithful, God is faithful.\n\nFor this, we adore Him.\n\nGod is the only perfect being for whom perfect faithfulness is possible. He is the only one whose shoulders are strong enough to bear all of our needs. He cares for the needy—those who are oppressed, hungry, imprisoned, blind, bowed down, and outcast. When the sojourner, widowed, fatherless, broken, and lost have nowhere to turn, God is there. Christ calls to us, “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28).\n\nFor this, we adore Him.\n\nPerhaps you are reading this today and you are burdened by how others have treated you. Or maybe you’re riddled with guilt over how you’ve treated others. Whatever your need, there is grace in God for filling up what is lacking in others. There is also grace for you, in covering your own guilt.\n\nFor this, we adore Him.\n\nGod will not let you down. When you are down, God will lift you up. If you have ever doubted the goodness and faithfulness of God, look to the cross and resurrection of Christ. In the cross of Christ, there is salvation from sin. In the resurrection of Christ, there is the promise that God is true to His Word.\n\nFor this, we adore Him.\n\nThere are no empty promises when we trust in God. “He remains faithful forever” (Psalm 146:6). For in Christ, the prisoners and oppressed are set free. In Christ, the blind finally see. In Christ, sojourners, widows, and the fatherless finally find their home. Find your hope in the Prince of Peace; in Him, there is sure salvation that never ends. \n\nFor this, we adore Him.\n\nThe Lord will reign forever. Our God will reign for all generations. Adore Him.\n\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

Earlier this year, I changed jobs and took on a new role with a lot more responsibility. The job itself was bound to be a growing experience, but before it even got rolling, the transition into the new role was a growing experience in and of itself. A series of miscommunications, a case of pure unfortunate timing, and a couple of other factors left me wondering if I had made a terrible mistake leaving my old job for this new one. For years I looked forward to waking up for work each day, and now I dreaded it. What had I done? \n\nThe difficult time I endured was nothing compared to the struggles of many, but for me, it was an incredibly discouraging three weeks. During that time, I came across Psalm 142, which is headed as “A Cry of Distress.” Indeed, this is why it was so comforting amidst my time of distress.\n\nIn Psalm 142, the psalmist feels as though evildoers are hunting him. While I never felt like anyone was out to get me in my difficult time, it felt as if the forces of the world were out to get me. It felt like everything that could go wrong was going wrong. \n\nThe psalmist writes in verse 6, “Listen to my cry, for I am very weak.” I prayed this short prayer dozens of times in that period, as I was experiencing deep emotional, spiritual, and even physical weakness. I remember waking up one morning feeling like I had done a three-hour muscle workout the day before because I had been bearing so much stress. \n\nThis psalm reminds us that when we feel as though we are weak to the point of withering away, God remains faithful and steadfast, and He can free us from whatever prison we feel has bound us. In Christ, we have been freed from sin and saved to the hope of eternal life with God. This simple truth itself ought to lift our heads and enlighten our spirits when we feel as though life cannot get any worse. \n\nThe next time you are in trouble and feel you’ve hit rock bottom, or close to it, cry out to God and ask Him to meet you in your place of utter and complete weakness. He is faithful, and He loves us enough to meet us in our need and bring us peace. He does not expect us to become strong in order to enjoy His presence.\n\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    About eight months ago, I started a new job—two new jobs, actually. I’m a pastor and a teacher at a school. I love doing both, and my quality of life has risen dramatically since taking these positions. But before that, I went through what you might call “the dark night of the soul.” Actually it was about two thousand dark nights. \n\nI never struggled with anxiety or depression. I had never had a panic attack. Nothing of the sort had ever happened to me. But then I started working at the bank, a job I was ill-fitted for and labored in for six years. The panic attacks were awful. And even though I have not had one in over eight months, the soul has a memory all its own. The dread that ran through me then is remembered all too well as I write about it now.\n\nThe worst part was waking up in the middle of the night when abject fear would take over. I would lie awake for hours, rehearsing failure and the fear of failure. Failure at my job. Failure at providing for my family. Failure as a father. Failure as a spouse. Failure as a Christian. \n\nI felt lost. I needed guidance. Prayers would often seem to barely escape my lips as I would silently mouth them with my wife sleeping peacefully next to me. And when I could choke them out, they seemed to disappear into the dark of the room before they could even bounce off the ceiling. “Lord, lead me. Show me what to do. How long?” I can remember just begging for the morning to come, and yet dreading it at the same time.\n\nWhen this happened I would recite psalms, even sing them. I wish I had known to include this from Psalm 143: “Let the morning bring word of your unfailing love” (v.8). This psalm teaches us to pray for guidance, and to trust in the Lord’s leading.\n\nYou are one of three types of people: you have been through something similar, are currently going through your own dark night of the soul, or you will one day. We all get a little lost sometimes. We all need the Lord’s guidance. The more I share my story with others, the more I see that I was not alone in this experience. I have rarely talked with an adult who has not experienced it to the full.\n\nLooking back I can get a little perspective. I was preaching to myself a message of law in which I was defeated at every point. What I needed was word of God’s unfailing love. I needed Him to guide me. I needed to remember the good news of what Christ had done on the cross to purchase such unfailing love. Very often the morning light itself was a reminder of that love.\n\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

And if you are anything like me, the immediacy and gravity of our access to what’s happening in the world can be dizzying and heartbreaking.\n\nJust today, as I’m writing this, I see in the news that one country bombed another, and then other countries took sides, and leaders puffed out their chests promising swift resolve. Yesterday, I learned that two African American men were arrested for sitting in a Starbucks without making a purchase. They were waiting on a third person to have a business meeting in that “third space.” The day before that, I read about a cancer diagnosis, a pastor falling from grace, and a lawsuit between a politician and an adult film star.\n\nWe live in a unique time in history, where information is free, global, and immediate. But how much tragedy and brokenness can a person absorb before he either breaks or goes numb? Were we designed to know as much as we do about what is happening all over the world? I know I often reach a point where my own heart feels the burdens of this world in a way that becomes a simple prayer: “Lord, come back soon.”\n\nIn today’s psalm, David prays from a posture of being overwhelmed by what is happening in the world around him, and how it is taking command of what is happening inside him. He is tired. The world is filled with injustice. The wicked seem to prosper. His own friends are betraying him. What is his prayer? Not to oversimplify, but if I were to boil it down, this prayer would be something on the order of, “Lord, make it stop.”\n\nThe hope of the gospel is that one day, all sickness, sorrow, injustice, war, famine, racial tension, infidelity, greed, betrayal, and political corruption will end. But until it does, until Jesus returns, He reminds us that in this life there will always be poverty and trouble (Mark 14:7; John 16:33). \n\nSo what do we do while we wait for the end of all injustice and poverty? We make it part of the cry of the soul. Praying for justice to prevail over evil, as David models for us, is an important part of actually doing something with our lives to push back against the darkness. This discipline in prayer lifts our gaze from ourselves and makes us look beyond ourselves to the world we inhabit. It draws from us a new prayer: “Lord, work through me.”\n\nLord, come back soon. Lord, make it stop. Lord, work through me. Amen.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

Once inside, Gacy would murder his unsuspecting guests, often hiding parts of their bodies in the walls and floorboards. \n\nPerhaps one of the most haunting accounts of Gacy’s deeds is Sufjan Stevens’s song named after Gacy. Stevens chronicles the nationally mourned tragedy that was the Gacy killing spree. At least 33 brutally murdered, hundreds of families’ lives destroyed, thousands upon thousands impacted and shattered by his criminal deeds. \n\nAs the song progresses you can’t help but participate in a sense of shared suffering, and ultimately, deep anger towards Gacy. It’s at that very moment that Stevens turns the tables, inviting us to peek beneath the floorboards of his own life. You see, Stevens knows he has secrets too—secrets that would harm and bring pain if exposed. Presumably, not mass murder, but what Stevens sees is that there is a capacity for great evil buried in every human heart, including his own. It is not what wholly defines us, but it is certainly there nonetheless. \n\nPrior to writing Psalm 51, King David had committed an unspeakable evil. He abused his God-given station and power. He slept with a married woman, Bathsheba, and used his influence to have her husband Uriah, who was also his own dear friend, murdered. As a result of David’s unfaithfulness, the Kingdom of Israel was eventually split in two. \n\nPsalm 51 is David’s cry to God on the heels of some of his worst thoughts and actions. By all counts, he had strayed far away from God. \n\nIt’s easy to see the depravity and evil woven into the lives of Gacy and David. After all, their worst and most deplorable moments have been laid bare on the page for all to see. Sometimes it’s harder to come face to face with the sin lurking in the corners of our own hearts and lives. But we must take a moment to consider: What exactly have we hidden beneath our own floor boards?\n\nWhat is that thing that you’ve hidden that you hope no one will ever discover? Maybe it’s an addiction— something you thought you could control but is now controlling you. Maybe it’s a relationship with someone you thought would make your life better, but who you now know is leading you further away from life and wholeness. Maybe you feel as if you’re leading a double life; what started out as one small sin is now eating away at your hope from the inside.\n\nWhat we see in Psalm 51 is that no matter the depths of our wandering, no matter how much pain we’ve wrought in our own life and in the lives of those we love, there is a way back. Actually, something better than a way back—a way forward and upward. A way that stretches into resurrection and eternity. \n\nWhatever that unspeakable thing, now is the time to speak it before God. David cries out, “Create in me a new heart, Oh God, and renew a right spirit within me” (v.10). We are invited to do the same.\n\nThere is a new heart waiting for you. That is God’s beautiful redemption at work in our shattered world. If you approach His throne with a “broken spirit and a contrite heart” (v.17), you will find the kind of hope and restoration many have never thought possible. David gives us some of the language. Jesus gives us His life. \n\nLook beneath the floorboards. Bring the dark things to light. Through prayer and petition which hinge on the sacrifice of His Son Jesus, God will give you a clean heart—He delights in doing so.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Theologian and preacher Charles Spurgeon declared Psalm 23 to be David’s “unrivalled pastoral,” explaining, “its sweetness and its spirituality are unsurpassed.” Indeed, this is a psalm for both heights and depths. Whether we walk by quiet waters or in the darkest valley, our Shepherd provides for our every need. He leads us to places of rest and provision. Though we pass through danger, we have the security of eternal dwelling in the Lord’s house. We can enjoy the sweetness of His guidance as He renews our life, even in the presence of our foes.\n\nAs I pray through this psalm, I am struck by how immediately Christ is revealed. From beginning to end, the comfort offered in this psalm is Christ Himself. “I am the good shepherd,” He says. “I know my sheep and my sheep know me” (John 10:14). He is not only the Shepherd, but by my Shepherd, our Shepherd. He knows us intimately, and we, the sheep of His pasture, know Him (Psalm 95:7). This is the chief comfort—that He is mine and I am His. All the securities and comforts of life flow from this intimacy. Apart from this intimacy, there is no true comfort. The Shepherd protects His own. \n\nBecause of this intimacy, “I have what I need” (Psalm 23:1). I lack nothing because Christ is my everything, and in Him all needs are met. At the forefront of His provision is His leading. He does not send us out alone, unprotected, but He goes before us. He is the Shepherd, our elder brother, our example, our advocate, our intercessor, our guide, our shield, our light. \n\nYes, He even goes before us in the valley of the shadow of death, and in the presence of our enemies. Psalm 22 immediately precedes, reminding us of how our Shepherd has gone before, bearing the agonies of the cross on our behalf. Where we go, He has already gone; He is no stranger to path He takes us on. He has passed through the dark valley and leads us onward, to quiet waters that run deep, to green pastures where He makes us to lie down in peace (Psalm 23:2). \n\nAs we pray this psalm, we remember that God’s comforts are not only for the here-and-now, but for all eternity. Indeed, the Apostle Peter reminds us, “And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive a crown of glory that will never fade away” (1 Peter 5:4). My cup overflows with the comforts of Christ. The Lord is my Shepherd. Thanks be to God.\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Mercy is one of the foremost attributes of God and one of the most highly sought after blessings in Scripture. Sadly, it is not highly valued in a society that praises strength, confidence, assertiveness, and independence. Crying out to God for mercy involves acknowledging our sinfulness and our absolute dependence upon Him to freely offer His forgiveness and sustaining grace. One of the fascinating truths in Scripture is that everyone who ever cried out to God for mercy was heard. But today’s psalm is not just an example of how we can pray—-it is an encouragement to all who call on the God of mercy.\n\nThe psalmist was often crying out to God in the midst of exceedingly difficult situations in which he found himself—situations that were sometimes caused by his own sin, and others that were brought about by the attacks of his enemies. Whenever he felt overwhelmed by the pressures of life or by the danger of a particular circumstance, the psalmist looked upward to the God who rules and reigns over all to deliver and rescue. \n\nWhat is most interesting about David’s prayers for mercy is that there is a mysterious conjunction of his sense of desperation and his confidence in God’s deliverance. Taken at face value, these two realities seem antithetical. However, we must remember that David knew God’s covenant promises and pleaded with Him for mercy on the basis of those promises. David knew that everyone who cried out to God on the basis of His mercy would receive the mercy for which he cried out. He knew the Lord heard his plea for help, that He accepted it, and would be faithful to answer him (Psalm 6:9).\n\nWe, too, must turn to God whenever we recognize that we have sinned against Him, as well as at those times when we feel overwhelmed by the difficult circumstances of life. We must acknowledge our weakness, fears, struggles, and doubts while hoping in the God who reveals Himself as being “merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in loving-kindness” (Psalm 103:8). \n\nWe can rest assured that God will be merciful to those who cry out to Him for mercy, because He withheld that mercy from His Son as Jesus cried out on the cross, in our place, “My God, My God, Why have You forsaken Me?” (Matthew 27:46; Psalm 22:1). It is only in Christ that all of the mercy of God is extended to us. If we are looking to Him alone for mercy, we can be confident that He “is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:19).\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    When my wife and I lived just north of Fort Worth, Texas, our fear of tornadoes was on red alert. Our area wasn’t just at risk of the occasional twister. We lived where many of those tornadoes tended to start. With a one-year-old daughter and a new house, we were often glued to The Weather Channel, sure that our day of disaster was going to come.\n\nI’d like to say that we always prayed and trusted the Lord in those moments. Truthfully, we didn’t. We treated tornadoes like embodied deities, almost bowing down to them and begging them not to hit our house. We might as well have prayed to Mother Nature like David did to the Lord: “Mother Nature, you are my God, save your servant who trusts in you!” We stopped just short of leaving an offering on our doorstep.\n\nKing David faced all sorts of trials, some self-inflicted and others due to evil from the outside. He was a man who needed to confess and repent for his own sin—including a Molotov cocktail of murder and adultery. And as King of Israel, he had other nations seeking his head on a platter.\n\nDavid was honest with God. He was desperate for Him. But in this psalm, he doesn’t shake his fist at God in anger or unbelief; instead, he cries out to God in worship. He feels alone and scared, but he also knows God is faithful and loving and righteous. He is confident in the Lord, but he also asks for a sign of comfort, something to help his heart believe what his mind knows to be true. And as the book of Psalms progresses, we see God answer him, over and over again. When we pray to Him, though we don’t always feel it, God is listening to the cries of His servants. He is a good Father who never shuts out His children.\n\nWhether it’s a real storm or some other situation in life that might as well be, God doesn’t ignore our cries for help. When we cry out to Him, He hears us and is faithful to answer us (Psalm 86:7). He rises up, over and over again, to offer comfort. He reminds us that though Satan and evil forces, and even our own sin, bring about destruction, He is actively making all things new (Revelation 21-22).\n\nWritten by Brandon D.

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I felt like I was having a heart attack. As we left my in-laws to make the five-hour trip back home, I could feel the pressure mounting in my chest. Without knowing the exact details, I knew I was headed back into an incredibly difficult situation, one David might describe as a “day of adversity.” I was gripped by fear and a troubled heart. The panic attack of anxiety that I was experiencing throughout the drive home consumed my entire being. \n\nPerhaps you’ve had a similar attack of anxiety as well. The trite responses sometimes given in those times of fearful worry are hardly remedies to steady us and give us a quiet heart. The encouragement to “just trust God more” becomes a curse more than a help. For David, the answer to calming his anxious heart isn’t in his need for more or better belief. The answer is found in reminding himself of the true nature of the God he believes in. \n\nKnowing the nature and character of God is an essential remedy for our lives when we battle anxiety. The power of positive thinking won’t take away our anxiety, but will often bring us to deeper anxiety as we wonder if we have enough positivity. Yet being reminded of the solid qualities of God’s character brings a calm in the midst of our greatest tempests. David shows us how to practice this as he reminds himself: \n\nThe LORD is his light—even when the fear closes in like darkness around him.\n\nThe LORD is his salvation—rescuer from enemies both real and felt.\n\nThe LORD is his stronghold—the only place of security that cannot be invaded.\n\nDavid looked to God to be the one to battle his enemies, to push back the attacks against him, and to vindicate him against every slanderous word and deed. He knew only God could be his peace. \n\nThis calm exists for us today as well. Jesus is the one who is the light of life, who was cast down into darkness through His crucifixion and sacrificial death on our behalf. Jesus is the one who was abandoned to His enemies in order to save us from the last enemy, death. Jesus is the one who is our stronghold—no one who comes to Him will ever be cast out. \n\nKnowing Christ and remembering all He’s done for us gives us a solid, practical step to take in the face of our anxieties. We can “cast all [our] cares on him, because he cares for [us]” (1 Peter 5:7). While we may be filled with anxiety and a troubled heart, we can pray Psalm 27 knowing that, because of Christ Jesus, the LORD cares for [us]” (v.10).\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    How excited would you be if someone gave you vast riches beyond your wildest dreams? Could you imagine the sense of security that would come with such a gift? There would be no more worries about tomorrow because your supply would meet whatever demand tomorrow would hold. There is a certain peace that comes with having all you need for a secure future, isn’t there?\n\nThe possibility of riches has a strong power to settle our hearts from the potential distresses that await us. It is interesting that the psalmist likens the joy he receives in God’s revealed decrees to the joy one might feel with all the riches of the world.\n\nMany Christians take the preciousness of God’s revealed Word for granted. With easy access to Scripture, we can often treat it as commonplace. However, we must remember that the gift of God’s Word is just that—a gift. God’s Word is a free gift from a self-revealing God. God was not obliged to reveal His law to us, but did so in love.\n\nHumanity’s deepest need is to be in a right relationship with our creator God. The law shows us what God expects of all people. Therefore, the written Word of God stands as one of the greatest and most precious of all of God’s gifts to His people! We do not have to wonder what God desires.\n\nEven still, when we read the law, we see that we have all fallen short. Who can live up to the standards of God? No human except one, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ perfectly fulfilled the law in our place, becoming our obedience. Jesus Christ sacrificially died in our place, perfectly paying the price for our disobedience. The written Word is upheld by the Word made flesh.\n\nWithout the written Word or the power of the Spirit, disobedience to God’s decrees is inevitable. However, the good news of the gospel is that in Christ, we are declared righteous before God. In Christ, we have the power of the Spirit to enable us to live according to God’s decrees. The law shows us what living in response to God’s grace looks like.\n\nHow much more then are we, like the psalmist, stirred to admire God, who has so lovingly bestowed this great gift upon His people? There is no distress for the Christian! No Christian wonders where they stand with God. In Christ, there is only peace and security for all of eternity. This truth matters not only for eternity but also for every day of our lives. This matters more than all the riches in the world. Let us echo the psalmist and rejoice in God! “I rejoice in the way revealed by your decrees as much as in all riches.”\n\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Have you ever had to rely on your memory for something important? Like, really important. I’m not talking about remembering to pick up milk at the grocery store on the way home from work or the date of your wedding anniversary. I’m talking about having to remember something so important that if you didn’t remember it, you would be putting your life and the lives of others in danger. We always have to remember dates, to-do lists, and other little bits of life, but few of us can recall a time in which our lives depended upon our memory. What we often forget is that our dependence upon God in our daily lives relies heavily on our memory.\n\nIn Psalm 77, the psalmist writes about his confidence in the past works of God in a critical time in which God seems silent. He writes: “I will remember the Lord’s works; yes, I will remember your ancient wonders. I will reflect on all you have done and meditate on your actions” (vv. 11-12). In times of crisis, when it feels as if our prayers are hitting the ceiling instead of the ears of God, our memories are some of our strongest weapons against the haunts of discouragement and despair. \n\nThe Israelites forgot. God led them out of bondage in Egypt with plagues and miracles, but when they didn’t like the food God rained down from the sky, they whined and wandered. David forgot. He sinfully pursued a woman who was not his wife, despite the wonders God had already accomplished through his life and works. Peter forgot. He denied knowing Jesus immediately following his arrest, even after knowing his Savior in the flesh and face to face.\n\nWhen we are in our darkest valleys, it sometimes feels like God is silent. But when we struggle to hear the voice and feel the presence of God, we must remember what He has done for us, particularly what He has done for us in Christ. This is one reason reading Scripture is so important. If we rarely engage God’s Word, it is difficult to find comfort in His promises or His past work on our behalf.\n\nAmidst the perceived silence of God, we are prone to forget. But in Psalm 77, we are reminded of the importance of remembering God’s works in both eternity’s past and in our own past. When it feels like God is silent, we resist the temptation to forge our own paths and forget the narrow way that has already been set before us (Matthew 7:13-14).\n\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The famous British preacher Charles Spurgeon dealt with crippling depression. Once, as the young preacher’s popularity was on the rise, he found himself preaching in the Surrey Garden Music Hall. During the sermon, someone in the balcony shouted “Fire!” and panic ensued. Seven people died in the chaos, and many blamed Spurgeon for the episode. From that point forward, depression was never far behind this great man.\n\nSeeking to run from his own internal nemesis, Spurgeon went on a holiday in Menton, France. The warm sun and stiff breeze ministered to his soul and rejuvenated his spirit. In explaining this to the pastors he trained at his college, he told them, “A mouthful of sea air, or a stiff walk in the wind’s face, would not give grace to the soul, but it would yield oxygen to the body, which is next best.” He told them that someone who camped out in his study and did not venture into God’s creation “needs not wonder if his heart forgets to sing and his soul grows heavy.”\n\nSpurgeon learned what we so often forget: it is easy to forget the goodness and glory of God when you spend little time enjoying the world He created. The longer we spend hunched over our phones, bathed in fluorescent light, the more we will lose our vision of God in His glory, splendor, and might, and the more we will find our souls withering away.\n\nThe psalmist’s words in Psalm 104 direct his soul to behold the beauty of God. He praises God for the splendor of His majesty, and in doing so, worships and sings over creation, which bears witness to God’s boundless glory. Then, he shows how creation itself trusts in the Lord’s provision and revels in the rest of creation.\n\nThis psalm emphasizes the initiative and care God took in every act of creation. He “set the earth on its foundations,” made “springs gush forth in the valleys,” caused “grass to grow for the livestock and plants for man to cultivate,” and “made the moon to mark the seasons” (vv. 5,10,14,19). At every step, the psalmist shows the creative power of God and how creation benefits from what He has done.\n\nMost of all, though, the men and women created in God’s own image enjoy this creation as a reflection of His goodness and loving care for us. He shows that the things we often take for granted are there to give us life and joy. He causes “the grass to grow for the livestock and plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food from the earth and wine to gladden the heart of man, oil to make his face shine and bread to strengthen man’s heart” (vv. 14-15).\n\nThis psalm calls us to venture outside into the good world the Father made. When we do, we find joy in what our Father provided, see His majesty reflected in what His hands formed, and cannot help but give back to Him the praise and glory that is due to His great name.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    In my home office, I have a stack of prayer journals I’ve kept since high school. Every so often, I look through them, hoping to jog a memory or retrace a bit of my spiritual journey. One thing I notice in those earliest entries is that many of my prayers followed a similar, simple pattern. I had a decent vocabulary as a teenager, but my early prayers didn’t show it.\n\nWhy? Because I was just learning how to pray, and I didn’t yet have the words. I didn’t know much about the depth of God’s nature, and I didn’t have a great awareness of my own emotions. These are things we learn over time. Part of the art of learning to pray is learning what to say and how to say it. \n\nOne of the great uses of Scripture is that it gives us vocabulary for talking to God. There is no better place in Scripture to learn the language of prayer than the Psalms. Today’s psalm is a great example. It says “My mouth will declare the LORD’s praise” (Psalm 145:21). God calls us to magnify His name and to sing of His glory, but the truth is, for many of us, we struggle to find the words. Psalm 145 is filled with language to help us praise God for His greatness.\n\nThe book of Psalms was the hymn and prayer book for the people of God from before the days of Jesus. God’s people have been using these writings as prayers ever since, and using them to shape and inspire their own prayers too.\n\nIn this reading plan, Psalms for Prayer, we have selected fifteen psalms for you to use when you pray. They cover a range of topics, from glorifying God, to praying for our personal concerns, to lifting up the needs of this world. Some of these psalms are worded as prayers offered directly to God; others act as thought prompts for the reader. Use these psalms to practice praying. Let them expand your vocabulary and sharpen your focus. Consider writing your own prayers down on paper.\n\nIt is good to pray with Scripture open before us because all Scripture can be used for prayer. The more we read and study the Word of God, the broader and richer our vocabulary will be when we pray to Him.\n\nAs you spend time with the psalms in this reading plan, I pray you will come to know the character and love of God in a deeper way. And as you practice the art of prayer, may you grow in the joy of expressing your love for Him in return.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

The wealthy Middle Eastern country is home to the Burj Khalifa, the largest building in the world. Dubai boasts of horse racing, luxurious hotels, restaurants, and islands with paradise-like beaches. The only problem is that the city is essentially built on sand. \n\nNearly a decade ago, the country blew sand from the ocean to create more land on which to build, and then spent an additional $450 million on even more sand with which to build. When I first heard that fact, I thought, This is not going to end well. After all, when Jesus warned about the sure way to make a shipwreck of your life, He drew off of the illustration of those who built their houses on sand. When He brought the Sermon on the Mount to an end, Jesus explained that there will be two types of responses to all that He taught: we will either be wise and build a life on the rock of Christ in sincere faith and obedience, or we will be foolish and build on the sand of personal unbelief and disobedience. \n\nTheologian J. Gresham Machen once famously said, “The Sermon on the Mount, like all the rest of the New Testament, really leads a man straight to the foot of the cross.”\n\nWhen we put ourselves up the ethical standard of Christ’s teaching, we feel undone because of how many times we have failed to keep the demands of God’s law. We then see our need for the Savior who went to the other Mount in order to take all of our sin upon Himself. Then, after we come to Christ in repentance and faith, we abide in Him by faith. We are empowered by His Spirit to walk in newness of life. Those who have been united to Jesus love His commands. Having been redeemed by Him from the guilt and power of sin, sincere believers find that “His commandments are not burdensome.”\n\nThe person, saving work, and teaching of Christ forms the solid foundation upon which believers stand. As we abide in Him by faith, we desire to grow in our obedience to His commands. Those who build on that foundation will survive in the day of testing. \n\nAll of this has very practical value. When the hardships in life come (and they will most certainly come), those who abide in Christ and His word will find themselves grounded on a solid rock. No amount of testing, trials, or suffering will ever be able to move them off of this solid foundation. “All other ground is sinking sand.”\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

It seems to strike at the heart both of our status in Christ, and our assurance of that status. Even the king’s guest at the wedding feast in Matthew 22 turned out to be an intruder, an imposter guest. How do we avoid such hazards?\n\nEnter by the narrow gate.\n\nWe like wide and easy paths, because they accommodate all of our baggage: our heads swollen with pride, our pet sins bundled about us with care, and the comforts of this world tangled about our feet. We’ve laden our camels with all these lawless and self-righteous accoutrements, and so we cannot pass through the needle-narrow way. Maybe we think God will be impressed by our accumulations, or by our fine self-made wedding garments. But really, we’re just carting around rotten fruit from a rotten root.\n\nThe way through is hard because it trims the fat, it pierces through joint and marrow, right down to the bone. Scripture is full of this image of cutting away, of pruning, even by fire. Why? Because the narrow gate leaves no room for our merits. In the kingdom of God, all the goodness is from Him. He is the giver of all good gifts. He distributes the wedding garments of His righteousness. He is the gardener, the true vine, and the first fruits all in one. And He is the gate, the door of the sheepfold.\n\n“Out of ourselves, into Christ we must go,” said C.S. Lewis. Every question, every concern, every fear, and every doubt is answered in Christ. Look outward and upward, not inward and downward. Do not drag your petty merits before the throne. Appeal to no sacrifice but Christ. \n\nJesus reminded His hearers that only those who do the will of His Father will enter heaven. What is the will of the Father, that we may do it? Jesus tells us, “This is the will of my Father: that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day (John 6:40).\n\nThere is no shortcut, no nifty 10-step program, no secret code, no positive thinking method, or groveling penance that will suffice. There is only Christ.\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    There is an old Puritan prayer, recorded in a wonderful little book called The Valley of Vision, which includes these words:\n\n“I thank you that many of my prayers have been refused.\nI have asked amiss and do not have,\nI have prayed from lusts and been rejected,\nI have longed for Egypt and been given a wilderness.\nGo on with your patient work, answering ‘no’ to my wrongful prayers, and fitting me to accept it.”\n\nWhere is God saying no to you, and what does that make you think about Him?\n\nIn today’s Scripture, Jesus tells us something we can trust about the character of God—He is a good Father. He knows what we need before we do, and cares about us more deeply than we could ever care about ourselves. This is a theme that runs throughout the Sermon on the Mount: God is deeply invested in our lives. We were created to know Him, love Him, enjoy Him, be led by Him, be cared for by Him, and be kept by Him. This is the nature of the relationship between a good father and his children.\n\nBecause we were made to relate to Him in this way, Jesus tells us to ask God for what we need. A good father gives his children what they need, and usually more, too. So ask Him for things—for resources, for help, for wisdom, for community, for healing, for forgiveness, for rest for your soul.\n\nBut Jesus also teaches us that a good father is someone who will say no when we ask for something that will harm us or work against us. Sometimes the best response a loving father can give to a pleading child is to say no, because sometimes the child unwittingly asks for a serpent or a stone.\n\nHow do we respond when God says no? We might be tempted to interpret His no as God being disinterested in us, but that can’t be true. That is not the way of a good father. Or we might think He isn’t listening, or worse, isn’t real. But that logic breaks down quickly. We cannot disprove the existence of God simply because He doesn’t give us everything we ask for. What kind of God would He be if He did? \n\nWe miss the goodness of God when we begin to evaluate His faithfulness based to what we perceive He has done for us lately.\n\nEven in our deepest seasons of confusion or want, we have good reason to believe that God has already addressed our greatest need—salvation. He met this through the sacrifice of His own Son in this way:\n\n“God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life” (Romans 5:8).\n\nThe God who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all, is the same good Father Jesus is talking about in the Sermon on the Mount. The “yes” he has already given in Christ will forever outweigh a million “nos.”\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

Not only that, but it also blinds us to our sin and brokenness. Perhaps this is why it’s easier to judge than to spend time doing intentional and internal soul work.\n\nScripture attests that as believers, we’re called to be discerning and to take a stand for what is holy over and above what is immoral, unjust, and ungodly. This is different than the sort of judging Jesus addresses in Matthew 7. \n\nA Matthew 7 sort of judgment is much like the kind Bonhoeffer describes in The Cost of Discipleship. It is judgment that seeks to deflect and put down, rather than to discern and lift up. Jesus calls us to be carefully and consistently practicing the discipline of spiritual introspection, working with the Holy Spirit to see into our hearts and souls. \n\nI wonder; do you have a rhythm in place as a part of your time with the Lord where you carefully examine your inner life? Jesus indicates that this is an important practice for all of His followers. Not until we’ve addressed the beam in our own eye will He lead us to a place where we can speak meaningfully to the speck in the eye of a brother.\n\nHere’s another question for consideration and reflection: have you been judging or holding a grudge against another as a way to avoid facing something in your own life that needs spiritual pruning? It’s all too easy to fall into this trap. Maybe it’s someone on social media who you’re silently judging? Maybe it’s an acquaintance from church, or a co-worker? Maybe, just maybe, it’s a family member? \n\nThe more you can relinquish any sort of judgment rooted in selfish motives, the more energy and attention you have freed up to focus on your own growth. It’s possible to miss the still, small voice of God nudging us to change, to grow, to commune with Him; we drown it out with our own loud voices of judgment and criticism. \n\nI pray we’re all able to release this sort of self-righteous judgment to the Lord, so we can then begin to tune in to the voice of the Spirit at work in our hearts. He’s there, carefully and lovingly working with each of us to remove the logs lodged in our eyes, bits and pieces at a time. Let’s make sure we’re creating space for those conversations rather than feeding the fire of a blinding judgmental posture.  \n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    All of us struggle with anxiety and worry from time to time. However, in its worst sense, worry can paralyze us in fear. All worry arises out of a threat or concern, either real or perceived. In a broken world, we cannot avoid worry. The question is, what do we do with our worry?\n\nWhen worry is aroused in my own life, I have found it helpful to explore what is going on in my heart. In order to face the spiritual issues that give root to my anxious thoughts, I begin the process of re-centering my heart on what is true about the situation: Am I worried because I think I cannot live without something? Or am I paralyzed by the fear of losing something? \n\nAsking good questions may reveal that we have put our trust in something that can’t sustain us, that we have put our hope in something that cannot ultimately fulfill us. See, worry tells us that we cannot overcome our circumstances or that we are empty without what we perceive as a need. Worry tells us that God is not listening, and that no one cares. \n\nIn Matthew 6, Jesus instructs us not to be anxious about our lives. He also reminds us that worry does not add a single hour to the span of our lives. His words help us to take the focus off of our momentary needs, desires, and fears, inviting us to live “without anxiety” because our heavenly Father knows and cares for us. \n\nDo you trust God? Do you believe that God will provide all that you really need in this life? Reaffirming our trust in God re-centers us in the storms of worry. The way out of the downward spiral of spiritually rooted anxiety and worry is to believe and act on what God says, rather than what you feel (or don’t feel) at the moment. In the debate between your feelings and the truth found in Scripture, Scripture must always win.\n\nThe ironic thing is, worry can actually be a conduit of hope. Worry can provide an opportunity for the power of God to be displayed in our lives. In your struggles with anxiety and worry, God is teaching you to depend on Him. As we are reminded in 1 Peter 5:7, we ought to cast all our anxieties on Him, because He cares for us. \n\nIf Christ has provided salvation from sin and victory over death—the very deepest of our needs—we can trust Him with the countless other things that strike worry in our hearts. When we seek His Kingdom first, all these other things will be provided as well. \n\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    One of the pillars of the progressive mindset these days is a commitment to avoiding what is known as dualistic thinking. The “either/or” mentality is old fashioned, if not backward. The wiser way to see the world today is with “both/and” eyes. Now, there are some instances where this is an improvement in the ways we relate to one another. The more we age and learn, the more we realize how complex things often are. What we once thought simple is anything but. We grow to become men, and we put away childish things.\n\nHowever, we must be careful not to also put away the childlike, one example of that being a wholehearted trust in God’s Word and allowing it to say what it says. And what our texts for today say is that when it comes to loving God and loving money, the dualistic mindset is nothing less than bankrupt. You can’t love both. It is very much an “either/or” scenario.\n\nWhen I think of today’s verses I am always shuttled back in my memory to a country song from my childhood: “Trying to Love Two Women.” The Oak Ridge Boys lightheartedly liken the effort to wearing a ball and chain, that while no doubt such an arrangement might be exciting at first, the truth of the matter is that such a duality quickly becomes a “grind.” One of my favorite lines in the song says, “A man can’t stock two shelves.”\n\nMemorable, huh? I love that. Yes, I have tried to put away a number of childish things as I’ve grown to be a man, but those things do not include my father’s music. \n\nIn a quite non-progressive, rather old fashioned, maybe even backward way, that’s what God’s Word is saying in Matthew 6:24: \n\n“No one can serve two masters, since either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”\n\nNow to be mature, we must take note that it’s not money that’s the problem here, but the love of money. One contemporary Bible translation refuses to beat around the bush and just uses the word “worship.” Memorable, huh? There is only One worthy of our worship and that is God the good Father. Trying to serve two masters, as the Oak Ridge Boys would say, is a “long old grind, and it tires your mind.”  \n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Before I say anything about fasting, you need to know a couple of things.\n\nFirst, I love to eat. Let me be clear: I plan all vacations around the meals I will eat. Everything else is filler. I do not like meals eaten on the run or quickly. And I like to eat almost anything except olives. No food is safe around me. I love to eat.\n\nSecond, because of my love of eating, I may not be the person you want to listen to in a discussion about fasting. I can count on half of one hand all the times I have “successfully” fasted. And even then I was so miserable as to wonder if I was actually doing what I was supposed to be doing. Once I participated in a fast with my church and we broke the fast after a couple of days with—wait for it—a vegetable lasagna. I was nearly enraged because I believe, strongly, that lasagna needs meat and that vegetables are for the salad on the side.\n\nThis may sound like I am contradicting my first point above, but I’m not really. Because that’s what fasting does to me, and that is the point of Jesus’ teaching on fasting in Matthew 6: \n\n“And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others” (v.16).\n\nYou have to stop and think about this one. Fasting causes one to feel gloomy, right? You feel physically and emotionally drained. It can be misery. So looking miserable would not make you a hypocrite, would it? Not really. But that is not what Jesus is pointing to. Jesus was saying the hypocrisy is in wanting others to see us as miserable while we fast. The hypocrisy is in saying we are fasting to pursue righteousness when, in fact, we are fasting to appear righteous.\n\nWhen I was fasting along with other members of my church, I could feel that desire for others to know I was forgoing what felt like my first love. I was dying to tell someone about what I was doing and the pain I was enduring. Every martyr wants their story told, right? \n\nThat is what we are supposed to see about ourselves in fasting: our need. If others see us in our misery, we are then puffed up and seen as righteous and holy. We want them to celebrate our sacrifice because when they do, we feel a false sense of security and affirmation. \n\nFasting is all about seeing our need for Christ because fasting tends to bring out the worst in us, like that insecurity and hypocrisy. Instead of reaching for security in food or others’ lauding our righteous works, we are to believe the gospel of Christ’s forgiveness of our insecurity and hypocrisy. And then, with all the fervor with which we want to lay hold of a meat-lover’s pizza, we lay hold of the righteousness of Christ by which we are secure before our “Father who sees in secret.”\n\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Growing up, I was one of three siblings. Although I was older, there came a point when my younger sister somehow learned how to tie her shoes before I did. So I asked her to teach me, but no matter how many times she showed me, I kept butchering it. Eventually, I came to the point where I would have rather just had velcro shoes.  \n\nAfter much practice and many failures, I finally learned to tie my shoes—because my sister knew what she was doing and modeled it for me. In a way, this reminds me of when the disciples asked Jesus how to pray. They were looking to their future older brother to teach them how to tie the divine shoestrings of prayer. \n\nPrayer is our vital lifeline to fellowship with God the Father. In Matthew 6, Jesus gives us the perfect model for prayer (but not before telling us how not to pray in verses 5-8). In verse 9, Jesus says that when we pray to God, we should talk to Him as our Father who is in heaven. \n\nFriends, that ought to cause a well of joy and excitement to spring up within us, that we get to call the God of the universe, the Maker of heaven and earth, “our Father.” This means we are deeply loved and accepted as His children. If you’re like me and your idea of an earthly father is a painful one, let this truth to sink in and allow God to show you what a real Father truly is. \n\nWhen my own daughter cries out and screams at me because she wants milk, I give it to her—not just because she’s crying and asking for it, but because she is my responsibility. She’s a gift from God, one on whom I seek to pour out my affection. So it is with God, our heavenly Father, who gives us good gifts and provides all that we need. When we come to the Father in prayer, we acknowledge our need for Him and His provision in every area of our lives. Jesus tells us that we can depend on God today and every day because His mercy and love for His kids is steadfast. \n\nOur God is a Dad who loves, protects, and provides for His children. Following Jesus’ model for prayer should liberate us to come boldly before our Father knowing He deeply loves us and is always present with us. \n\nGod does not expect us to come to Him with eloquent, perfectly worded theological dissertations on prayer. He is looking forward to communing with His sons, whom He deeply loves. \n\nWritten by Jevon Washington\n\n                ",

But until it does, I will continue to give most of my TV time to HGTV and the History Channel.\n\nThere’s a show on the History Channel called American Pickers. Have you seen it? The concept revolves around two guys, Mike and Frank, who drive around the country looking for people’s properties which have antiques, old gas pumps, motorcycles, and the like. They knock on the door, ask if they can walk around, and offer to buy things they think they can sell in their antique shop.\n\nThese guys know almost everything about old junk. But every so often they’ll find an old part to something from a bygone era. They won’t know what it is, but they’ll buy it anyway because they think it would look cool hanging on someone’s wall. They don’t know what they’ve actually got, but they know it looks good.\n\nPastor James Boice wrote, “Prayer is an important subject, for prayer is at least partially confusing to us all.” I think prayer is a mysterious thing. Don’t you? I’ve been a praying person most of my life, but I confess I don’t fully understand it. I know I’m tempted to use it for show. Are you? We’re not always sure what it does or confident if it even works, but prayer sure looks good on display.\n\nAs mysterious as prayer may be, today’s passage gives us remarkable clarity on one thing: God hears our prayers—and because He does, we should pray and we should never fake it.\n\nLet’s talk about what’s at stake in these verses. God gives us commands so that we might know how to love Him and interact with His love for us. So today’s verses are not about how to keep ourselves from upsetting a cranky God. They are about how to draw near to a loving God.\n\nPrayer is a glorious concept. We, the meek and lowly, can address the High King of Heaven, and He hears us. So Jesus says, when you pray, don’t pretend. Don’t waste the moment by making it all about how others will see you. You’ll exhaust yourself. There is no end to trying to impress others.\n\nWe can’t rest in the promised nearness of God if our prayers are offered either for show or for self-comfort. So Jesus says, when you pray, really pray. Can you hear the love of Jesus in the command to not pretend when we pray? He is not just fighting against hypocrisy. He is fighting for our joy, our delight, our learning to speak the language of glory. \n\nWe are learning our native and eternal tongue when we pray. And in these verses, Jesus is fighting for us, to draw us into an ongoing dialogue with Him.\n\nDon’t pray just for show. Pray as though your prayers reach the ear of God, because they do. \n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    In these days of social media ubiquity nothing is hidden. Our discretion and privacy have nearly vanished. People live in digital “glass houses,” and do so on purpose. Life is a performance to please our followers. This means that every good deed is advertised. When we donate to a GoFundMe page, it puts the dollar amount next to our name. When we give to someone in need, we humblebrag about being “so glad to be able to help.” We live to be praised. \n\nBut this is antithetical to how Jesus tells us to give. Don’t practice your righteousness for others to take note of, He says. Don’t use generosity as leverage to heap praise on yourself. \n\nWhen we live to be praised, one of two things happens. We receive no praise and are hurt, or we receive the praise we sought and are left desiring even more. And this is our reward, Jesus says. For those who give publicly and practice good deeds for the eyes of mankind have received their reward: the vaporous, temporal praise of people.\n\nInstead, Jesus points us to the heart of giving and generosity. He instructs us to not let our left hand know what our right hand is doing; to give in private. God will see and will reward us as He sees fit. The heart of giving is not praise from the recipient or from those who see the “good” deed; it is a heart of love. It is a heart marked by gratefulness for all that God has given us. \n\nTo give seeking praise is to not really give at all. It is to make a business transaction: I give and, in return, you praise me. Godly generosity, on the other hand, gives seeking nothing in return. It knows that God sees both our actions and the heart behind them. He takes note of those good deeds which are done in secret and is pleased by them. Not only is He pleased, He promises to reward them—whether in this life or in the next—and that reward will be so much richer than any adulation this world has to offer. \n\nIt is a difficult shift to go from doing good with the hope of receiving praise to, instead, doing good from a place of humility and love, confident that it pleases God. If we think more about the generosity God has shown us, we will find this easier. If we think more about the recipient of our generosity as an equal image bearer of God, it will help us. If we consider our ongoing need for generosity, both physically and spiritually, that will help too. \n\nThe heart of giving is not what we receive in return, but what we have already received from God. He sees. He knows. He is pleased and rewards. And no praise from our fellow man, be it online or in person, can compare to that eternal reward. \n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

Love God, love your neighbor, love one another—and love your enemy.\n\nLike the man who wants to wiggle out of loving his neighbor by asking, “Who’s my neighbor?”—do you wonder, “Well, who’s my enemy?” We may not have arch enemies or a nemesis we battle on the hillside. But we have enemies, those who are against us and those we are against.\n\nIs your boss a jerk to you? Do you cold-shoulder him in the hall? What about that co-worker who’s always bashing Christianity? How do you view him? How do you treat him? I’m sure your neighbors all park their cars in their garages and never clog up the street and never mow their grass at weird times. \n\nBrothers, we either have enemies, or we make enemies in the depths of our hearts. The Lord Jesus calls us to love them.\n\nSadly, we think we are doing enough if we aren’t being a jerk in response to the jerks around us. But the kingdom’s ethics are bigger, and bloodier, than we think. Passivity isn’t love. The verb-quality of love moves us to honor, serve, pray for, and be kind to our enemies. Love doesn’t cold-shoulder people. Love greets. Love doesn’t get fed up. Love endures. Love doesn’t pre-judge someone because of their race, ethnicity, or accent. If we only love those who are like us, we aren’t living the crucified and risen life with Christ. We are living in our flesh.\n\nGod loved His enemies: you and me (Romans 5:10). Sons of God are empowered by the Son of God to love their enemies like He loved His. For their good. \n\nJesus loved His enemies to the point of death—His own. A blood-stained cross is our template. Death to self is the first step toward loving our haters. Because the gospel is true—because you’ve experienced the love of God—which enemy will you love today? Jesus is ready to help.\n\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The lex talionis has been called the law of retaliation: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. When I have been wronged, I have to admit, the principle of retributive justice is really appealing—the principle of the punishment fitting the crime.\n\nOf course, Jesus undoes our self-oriented inclination to interpret the law as a means of personal vengeance. We love the idea of “getting even,” or even simply of getting credit, getting our due. If someone else steals, breaks, offends, we think we have every right to even the score. We come up with justifications in various circumstances: It’s just business. I’ve been patient enough. It serves him right. He had it coming. We rejoice when things seem to balance out again. \n\nBut any time our focus is on getting what we believe is due to us, are we not violating Christ’s command? The root of the issue Christ addresses is a heart opposed to grace, and therefore opposed to God’s law. \n\nRemember Paul’s exposition of the law in Romans 7 and 8? Paul declares: “For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God’s law; indeed, it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God” (Romans 8:7).\n\nIt is this fleshly-mindedness that Christ confronts. A merely temporal vision of justice always comes up short of God’s standard. Indeed, an honest approach to the law provides no comfort for sinners. Do we really desire justice? Before the law, we stand condemned, unable to pay the balance for our sin.\n\nBut oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and how inscrutable His ways (Romans 11:33.) God, rather than executing the just condemnation of the law against us, has granted mercy. To this, not to the “law of retaliation,” we must entrust ourselves. This is the sticking place for our hard hearts, because we have our own notions of justice, of what we deserve, of what we owe, of who else deserves or doesn’t deserve. We love the idea of justice only if it is our own concocted version. \n\nBut Christ, sinless, gave all of Himself for us sinners. \n\nThis is an example for us. It should pierce our self-focused hearts. It should shake us from our fixation on getting what’s ours. It should humble us, and it should fill us with thankfulness and joy. \n\nChrist gave His example in this: His richness He freely gives to us. He has turned the other cheek, walked the second mile, clothed us with His white robes, and gives to us grace without cost. In light of this great love, how can we not also joyously do the same for others?\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Last year, my 8-year-old son, Eli, was at a friend’s birthday party. Toward the end of the party, he ran over to me, sobbing uncontrollably. When I asked him what was wrong, he told me his friend had promised not to kill his player on a video game they had been playing; but unfortunately, his friend continued to do so. While I insisted that it was only a game, Eli looked at me and said with the deepest sincerity, “But, it’s not right to break a promise.” \n\nThis is actually one of the most important lessons of which the Scriptures constantly remind us. Whether it is the law of God (Exodus 20:7), the wisdom literature (Ecclesiastes 5:4-7), the Gospels, or the Epistles, there is no part of Scripture in which the Lord does not confront us with the call to be truth-loving, truth-speaking, and truth-acting people. The Savior sums up this important principle of Christian living when He says, “let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ For whatever is more than these is from the evil one” (Matthew 5:37). \n\nOur society is one in which we are accustomed to breaking our vows. People treat marriage vows, church membership vows, and financial agreements with the greatest of flippancy. Ours is a society that will break our promises over the smallest and most insignificant of things. The lack of emphasis on this important subject makes a true theology of vow-taking and vow-keeping one of the greatest needs of our day. \n\nThat being said, vow-breaking is not something unique to our time. During Jesus’ earthly ministry, religious leaders in Israel constructed a complex system of getting out of vows. The Pharisees practiced subterfuge by actually using the name of God, and their service in His name, to release them from the obligation to keep the vows that they made. In doing so, they were functionally bringing the name of God into the service of their hypocrisy. This is why Jesus condemned all deceitful practice in vow-making to be “of the evil one.” \n\nGod is the God of truth. Jesus self-identified as “the Truth.” Therefore, all those who profess faith in Christ are to be truth-loving, truth-speaking, and truth-acting people. Even as we say this, we recognize our many failures in keeping the vows we have made. None of us has perfectly fulfilled all that we have said we would do. \n\nThe good news of the gospel is that the One who said, “I am the Truth,” was nailed to the tree for all the times we have spoken and lived deceitfully. His promise to forgive those who come to Him in repentance and faith is a sure and steadfast “Yes” because of His covenant faithfulness to His own promises (2 Corinthians 1:20).\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    “Today you enter into a covenant, not a contract. If this were a contract, either party could walk away when the circumstances change.” This was our pastor’s first comment to us in our wedding ceremony. His words were a warm reminder of the covenantal nature of marriage, a lifelong monogamous relationship between a man and a woman.\n\nThis truth addresses a profound misunderstanding that our society has regarding the sanctity of marriage, a problem the ancient society had as well. The fact that Jesus makes reference to a “certificate of divorce” in the Sermon on the Mount indicates that divorce and remarriage were somewhat accepted and practiced during His time (Matthew 5:31). However, Jesus is unmistakably clear, “everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery” (Matthew 5:32). The reason is simple: in God’s eyes, marriage should be a permanent union of a man and woman as “one flesh” (Genesis 2:20-25; Mark 10:8).\n\nJust prior to His statements on divorce, Jesus gets to the heart of the matter in asserting that those who lust have committed adultery in their hearts (Matthew 5:27-28). It is not just the fruit of adulterous desires that Jesus warns us about, but the seeds of those desires as well. Jesus is not removing the distinctions between sin of intent and action; He is simply elevating lust as a matter that Christians must fight with the same amount of seriousness as adultery. This not only speaks to how one should react to temptation, but it is also a proactive truth that warns us before we encounter temptation.\n\nFor married men, there are times when our sexual desires rage and we are tempted to turn to other means of sexual satisfaction apart from our wives. In these circumstances, we are tempted to functionally treat our marriages as a contract in order to fulfill our self-centered desires. “She is not upholding her end of the contract, so I will look elsewhere.” Unmarried men are tempted to pursue the same sort of sin—sexual satisfaction outside the bonds of marriage.\n\nWhether single or married, it is important to remember what God had in mind when He declared that to be united to someone through a marriage covenant is to be bound by promise, or oath. A marriage covenant is not only a declaration of present love but also a mutually binding promise of future love, regardless of the circumstances. What God has joined together, let no one separate—not by action or intent.\n\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

It signals a change in the way the old traditions were to be interpreted and applied. Though we are not a people dependent upon the law or old traditions for salvation—Praise God!—we are still called to place our lives under God’s holy guidelines for righteous living. \n\nRemember, Jesus “did not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it” (Matthew 5:17). And in fulfilling it, He also speaks into our individual experiences, helping us to grapple with some of the more challenging aspects of daily life. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus seems to either release His audience from undue bondage to legalism, or, as we see in today’s reading, He intensifies and clarifies the heart of the Father, bringing the revelation of God deeper into our realities. \n\nWhile we hold dearly to the hope of our salvation by grace through faith, we can also remember the words of Jesus when He proclaimed: “If you love me, you will keep my commands” (John 14:15). \n\nEven when we bring all of this context to Matthew 5:27-30, we are still left with some difficult truths. As we read this passage in light of the rest of the witness of Scripture, we know that we have “a great high priest” who is able to empathize with our every struggle, and we also know there is nothing that can separate us from the love of God (Romans 8:31-39). \n\nI actually believe it’s love—not condemnation, but the deep, holy love of God—that can be found in this teaching. God’s heart for us is that we walk in the way worthy of our calling and identity. It’s a calling that drills down to the core of our being. Jesus intensifies this teaching not to drive us to despair, but to drive us to Him. \n\nGod’s desire for us is a life intimately connected to Him through His Son. As we grow closer to Him, not only do our outward actions change, but we are radically recreated and changed within. God wants not only our actions and words, but also our hearts. While today’s teaching can often feel like a source of shame or defeat, may it also be an encouragement that God is working within us to transform our hearts, that we might overcome even the deepest entanglements with sin. \n\nTrue freedom comes when we lay everything we have, even our brokenness, sinfulness, and shame, at the foot of the cross. That sort of Jesus-freedom runs deeper than any heart-sin ever can. And in that, we have cause to rejoice, and to continually challenge and encourage one another.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n               ",

Essentially it means “not my problem,” but the Polish are a bit more memorable with their phrasing:\n\n“Not my circus, not my monkeys.”\n\nIn its purest sense the proverb is a reminder that we cannot solve everyone else’s problems, and it’s often wise to walk away if we don’t have skin in the game. But most proverbs don’t stay pure very long in our fallen fingers. We quickly twist them to our own ends. The impure version allows us to use that phrase in the spirit of Cain: “Am I my brother’s keeper? Nope, not my circus…” And we walk away from people that, truth be told, we simply don’t want to deal with.\n\nThere’s a world of difference between trying to solve everyone’s problems and avoiding our response-abilities as believers. The latter is one of the truths that pulses in today’s texts, that as tempting as it may be, you and I cannot walk away from brothers or sisters who have something against us. Don’t miss that distinction—it is not that we have something against them, but they have something against us. That detail makes it so easy to lean in the distorted direction of “not my monkeys” because we feel justified in distancing ourselves from that person: “Well, that’s their problem.” Actually, as Christians, it’s our problem, and we are always to take the initiative. \n\nFor example, let’s say you’re about to drop your money in Sunday’s offering plate, and in your mind’s eye you suddenly see the face of a friend who is at odds with you. For such thorny situations Jesus doesn’t give us a proverb as much as a prod. \n\n“…leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother or sister, and then come and offer your gift” (Matthew 5:23-34).\n\nWowzers. That sounds rather extreme, doesn’t it? And it would be if this were nothing more than a circus full of monkeys. But it’s not. The language in these texts is that of family—“brother” and “sister.” So our proverb sounds something like this:\n\n“You’re my family. You’re my brother.”\n\nAnd with that we make the first move.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

Would I have thought He was off His rocker? Would I have followed Him, though He was a dangerous demagogue? \n\nMy guess is I would have been tempted to side with the religious leaders of the day, those Pharisees who had been laboring with the approbation of tradition and Scripture to preach the law to those who rejected it. I think I would have been jealous of Jesus’ success and fame. So when I read that Jesus did not come to abolish the law but to uphold it, I receive this as a person who is well aware of his own proclivity toward legalism. \n\nAt that time, everyone would have heard Jesus’ teaching and watched His actions with some wonder. Of course, the Pharisees would have assumed that Jesus was abolishing the law and been upset at the prospect. And those on the fringe of Jewish society might have said, “Heck yes! Finally!” at the thought of someone overturning all the laws they didn’t like anyway. \n\nEach of these groups could have looked at Jesus’ grace and mercy toward sinners and thought He was abolishing the law. But He informed them that He came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it, saying, “unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 5:20). And with that, He demolished the expectations each of these groups had for Him.\n\nThe Pharisees believed Jesus had no regard for the law, but in fact, His standard for righteousness far surpassed that of the Pharisees. The rank and file thought they were very righteous, but Jesus knew they had murder in their hearts. That is what Jesus wanted everyone to see: righteousness of the heart must be greater than outward conformity to the law. \n\nJesus was upping the ante.\n\nI wonder how those on the fringe—those who were often called “sinners” by the Pharisees—  would have heard this. The woman at the well. Zacchaeus. I wonder how they would have heard Jesus’ words. Maybe they would have been put off or confused. Maybe they would have despaired. \n\nBut maybe that’s what Jesus was really after. Maybe He wanted everyone to see something we often miss: our sin problem is far bigger than we think it is. It is bigger than the Pharisees ever-growing lists of things required and forbidden. And our sin problem is bigger than what we, the sinners, think we’re really guilty of. I believe Jesus wants us, sinners and Pharisees alike, to despair of our righteousness, to feel hopeless in our own strength. I believe He wants us to see we need someone who can fulfill the law for us because we cannot do it for ourselves. This is where Jesus comes in. \n\nThese statements are truly the gospel in shadow. Here we see what we need—a righteousness that far surpasses all we think is righteousness—and we see what God supplies for us in Jesus: One who can fulfill the law’s demands for us. These are words that not only undo us, but graciously point us to Christ and His sufficiency.\n\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

Literally every single food is improved by these divine gifts. They can even make kale edible—a miracle indeed. And did you know that a high sodium diet is biblical? Tell your doctors, gentlemen.\n\nOkay, that’s not really true. Maybe it will be in the new earth one day, but not now. Salt is, however, a key ingredient in life, as prescribed by Scripture. It’s just a different sort of salt. \n\nJesus tells us that His followers are the “salt of the earth” (Matthew 5:13). Paul tells us our speech should be “seasoned with salt” (Colossians 4:6). To confuse matters, we are also called to be “a light for the nations” (Isaiah 49:6). So followers of Jesus are to be salt and light, but what does that mean?\n\nSalt makes bitter foods palatable, and it accents flavors that might otherwise be missed. It complements both sweet and spicy flavors, and makes “blah” foods enjoyable. And all of these indicate what Jesus asks of us too. \n\nThrough Jesus, we are to be the ones who help others find hope and joy in bitter circumstances. Through Jesus, we should be the kind of people who see the delightful things of the world—the sweet and the spicy—and add the salt of the gospel in just the right way as to complement and highlight God’s work and truth in them. And through Jesus, we should add life and flavor to the mundane and the blah. \n\nLight is another metaphor for the same thing. God uses us to shine the hope of the gospel into darkness, to drive it away and show a way forward. We refract the light of Christ so people see the colors of His beauty. We bring an ambiance of Jesus into the dim and dull, to give comfort and peace.\n\nThis call comes with a warning, lest we decide to try to be salt and light in our own power. For if we do that we will lose our flavor and become dim. And what is flavorless salt but simply annoying grit to be swept up and thrown out? What is a burnt-out light bulb but glass garbage? Should we decide that we no longer need to be flavored with salt and be reflectors of Christ’s light, or should we decide that we can be these in our own strength, then we, too, will become spiritually useless.\n\nThankfully the One who calls us to be salt and light provides limitless flavor and brilliance. He is an infinitely perfect source. We simply share it and shine it forth into a world dying to “taste and see that the Lord is good” (Psalm 34:8).\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

But I admire my kids’ longing for what is yet to come. They are looking forward. They want the future. Enduring in this state of “already but not yet” is an act of childlike faith. As Christ followers, we are already heirs of the kingdom of God, looking forward to its completion here on earth, which has yet to come.\n\nThe Beatitudes open Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, pointing us to the blessed “yet to come” of the kingdom. In these opening words, Jesus reveals otherworldly blueprints for kingdom living. His descriptions of blessedness are overflowing in the introduction, and they are signposts for this sermon and for the Christian life, both now and on into eternity.\n\nLike the people listening to Jesus on the side of a mountain that day, we also come to Him wanting our needs satisfied and itches scratched. And as Jesus is prone to do, He points us in another direction, to a new way of understanding. Jesus wants to shatter our unmet expectations of life. He wants us to die to them, so He can give us new ones.\n\nLives that are fixed on this world are not sustainable for the coming kingdom of heaven. We need more than human remedies, and so Jesus brings His heaven-marinated truth, which rocks the rickety boat of our understanding. In the kingdom of heaven, being poor in spirit is a win because it points to the sufficiency of our God. Humility may not always get us ahead at the office, but we will inherit the whole earth because we are His sons. The Beatitudes are head-scratchers to us now, here on earth, because they point to a future and forever home in heaven.\n\nEvery verse of the Beatitudes reorients us away from our current conditions and toward what is coming soon, and very soon. As disciples of Christ, we do not find our comfort in a reinforced house of cards; we find it in the gospel of the kingdom of God, in the already and not yet. True flourishing and real life can only be found in the ways of the crucified and risen Christ. He invites us to discover true blessedness—joy, peace, contentment, rest, the thrill of adventure, and excitement—with Him and in the blessings to come. We will be called sons of God. \n\nRejoice, brothers! Because of Christ, our reward is great in heaven.\n\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n                ",

Many sections from this one sermon have been turned into entire sermon series in themselves; the Lord’s Prayer and the Beatitudes come to mind.\n\nI am excited to spend the next several weeks unpacking it along with other “Hes” reading Truth. As you read through the sermon in its entirety today, see if John Stott’s words about it resonate:\n\n“The Sermon on the Mount has a unique fascination. It seems to present the quintessence of the teaching of Jesus. It makes goodness attractive. It shames shabby performance. It engenders dreams of a better world.”\n\nAt the heart of this sermon is the promise of a coming kingdom—one that is with us now in part, but will one day be realized in full. This sermon about the kingdom of God was delivered by the King Himself, Jesus Christ. He spoke these words to a weary and confused people. The generations of Israelites leading up to Jesus’ birth (and this sermon) had been through a season. They had rebelled against God. They had been carried off into exile. They had returned only to have their homeland become occupied by Rome. Jesus’ audience for this sermon was made up of people who were struggling to remember both who they were and whose they were.\n\nIn this sermon, Jesus reminds them, and us, what the kingdom of God is, what it is not, and how to live as citizens of His kingdom now, in this life. But this sermon is more than a call to obedience. It is also a description of the life Jesus lived in our place. His entire ministry—in life, death, and resurrection—would go on to embody the kingdom citizenship He describes in these three chapters. The Sermon on the Mount shows us how to receive Jesus as our King, the one who came to perfectly fulfill the law of God in our place.\n\nAs you study this sermon, ask the Lord to show you how to live as someone who belongs in His kingdom even now, trusting in the finished work of Jesus, our King, to secure your citizenship forever.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

He eventually pursued his artistic dreams at the collegiate level, and after graduation moved to Pennsylvania, where he immediately took up a position as an art teacher. \n\nAs a young adult he was able to venture out on a tour of some of Europe’s finest galleries, taking in great masterpieces and refining his own painterly skills. Some said he had the makings of a truly exceptional artist, poised to take his place among the greats.\n\nJudson had been a devout believer since his youth, and as an adult, he became active in the music ministry at his church. Though he’d always loved being an artist, the tug of ministry life proved a real struggle for him. God had all along been wooing him to full-time ministry, and it seemed that his hope of a life of artistic influence would have to go. After years of struggle, Judson knelt in prayer, saying, “I surrender all to Thee.” Years later, he penned the hymn inspired by this pivotal moment of calling. \n\nFrom this patient life of submission, God brought forth much fruit—not only through the impact of this famous American hymn, but also through Judson’s ongoing service at Florida Bible Institute, where a young Billy Graham was inspired by Judson’s ministry. \n\nAs in Judson’s life, the gentle moving of God’s Spirit often works by ordinary means to affect in us extraordinary surrender. May our hearts, quickened by His Spirit, be conformed to His likeness, molded by His love, and enlivened by His power, that we may rest on nothing of our own, but surrender all to Him.\n\nEssay by Caleb Faires\n\nI Surrender All by Judson W.

To make matters worse, he was also kind, an expert swimmer, captain of the baseball team, and student orchestra leader. Babcock’s tall, muscled figure was the only thing about him that wasn’t well-rounded. \n\nAfter graduating from Syracuse University, he attended Auburn Theological Seminary and eventually became the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Lockport, New York. In between his daily pastoral duties, Babcock itched to get out of the church office and explore the outdoors surrounding it. \n\nHis favorite place to walk was a large hill two miles away that overlooked Lake Ontario. Grabbing his coat and running out the door, Babcock would tell his secretary, “I’m going to see my Father’s world.” He’d later write a sixteen-stanza poem, each verse beginning with that very same sentiment: “This is my Father’s world.”\n\nSadly, Maltbie Babcock died at age 42 from a bacteria he contracted on a ship en route to the Holy Land. Following his death, his wife compiled his writings into a book called Thoughts for Everyday Living, published in 1901. Fourteen years later, in 1915, the tune for this poem-turned-hymn was arranged from an old English melody by one of Babcock’s close friends, accomplished musician F.L.

One of the more popular of these traveling teachers was A.J. Showalter. Showalter published over 130 music books, his sales exceeding more than two million copies. He traveled throughout the South to various churches, spending roughly a month with each of them, teaching these revival songs. \n\nOn one of these trips, while in the small town of Hartselle, Alabama, A.J. Showalter returned to his room to find two pieces of mail. Each was from a former student, and each contained a tragic story. Both students had lost their wives on the same day and were now widowers. \n\nEager to offer them solace, Showalter searched the scriptures till he found Deuteronomy 33:27, which read, “The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.” And so he began to write the memorable chorus,\n\nLeaning, leaning, safe and secure from all alarm\nLeaning, leaning, leaning on the everlasting arms.\n\nShowalter sent the devastated men these words of comfort even as he was still struggling to compose the verses. He shared what he’d written with a friend, Elisha Hoffman, who then provided the verses. With those verses in place, Showalter wrote the music of the hymn we know today.\n\nIt’s ironic that this hymn, born of great tragedy, is couched in an upbeat tune that makes it so easy to remember. But in times of great sorrow, there can be no better truth to recall than this: we can lean, safe and secure, on the everlasting arms of our Lord.\n\nEssay by Matthew B.

He’d sit and read Scripture while waiting for film to develop, his well-worn Bible illuminated by the room’s familiar glow. \n\nOn such a day in March 1912, Miles began to process his photos, then opened his Bible to John chapter 20 as he waited. He’d read the passage before; it was one of his favorites. But this time, the scene seemed to come alive. He found himself imagining he was face to face with Jesus as He spoke to Mary near the empty garden tomb.\n\nOf the experience Miles wrote, “I awakened in full light, gripping the Bible, with muscles tense and nerves vibrating. Under the inspiration of this vision, I wrote as quickly as the words could be formed the poem exactly as it appeared. That same evening I wrote the music.”\n\nIn addition to his photos, Miles had developed a reputation as a music director at conventions, churches, camp meetings, and the like.Not long before that March inspiration, a music publisher named Adam Geibel had asked Miles to compose a specific type of hymn—one that was sympathetic and tender, “one that would bring hope to the hopeless, rest for the weary, and downy pillows to dying beds.” With the Holy Spirit’s help, a “downy pillow” for the soul is just what he delivered. \n\nWe all come to the garden alone, but our suffering Savior meets us there.

One such teen was Bessie, a 14-year-old daughter of an alcoholic. Black met her in an alley in town, invited her to church, and she accepted. Bessie attended regularly until one day, as Black called roll, she did not respond.\n\nThe gospel teacher’s heart was moved by her absence. He said to the class, “When my own name is called up yonder, may I be there to respond.” \n\nAfter Sunday school, James Black went to Bessie’s home to find her laid up with pneumonia, on the verge of death. Again his heart was pierced. He went home and, in a single sitting, wrote “When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder.” A few days later he led the congregation in singing the hymn at Bessie’s funeral. \n\nMore than a century later, Black’s song remains a reminder of hope in the face of mortality and suffering—a proclamation of the certainty of Christ’s coming. It isn’t a declaration of judgment, or some hellfire and brimstone dirge. The lyrics lift the soul and call listeners to Jesus. \n\nBlack calls believers to revel in, reflect publicly, and proclaim the love of Jesus—“of all His wondrous love and care”—as he did for Bessie and so many like her.

His fingers are smudged with ink as he prays and pens and receives inspiration. A piano sits nearby, where he taps out a tune to adorn his words. It’s a very holy, solitary affair.\n\nPerhaps other hymns were written this way, but “Jesus Paid It All” was not. Of the hymn’s origin, one author put it this way: “An obscure woman scribbles a poem on the flyleaf of her hymnal, an amateur church musician unknowingly creates a matching tune, an unknown pastor provides encouragement, and another hymn is born.” \n\nWritten in 1865, this hymn about the total sufficiency of Christ’s atoning work on the cross was not a solitary affair, but a fruit of His church. Partially inspired by William Bradbury’s hymn by the same name, this version was written by Elvina M. Hall, while she sat listening to a sermon from the choir loft of Monument Street Methodist Church in Baltimore, Maryland. She jotted the lyrics on the inside of her hymnal and shared them with her pastor after the service. \n\nNothing might have become of those lyrics had John T. Grape not also attended Hall’s church. \n\nThirty years earlier, Grape served as organist and choir director, during which time he composed a tune titled “All to Christ I Owe.” After hearing the music, the pastor was reportedly “unimpressed,” and set it aside. Thankfully, that same pastor recalled Grape’s tune as he read Hall’s words some three decades later. He believed they would make a great match, and history has proven him right. \n\nThe story of “Jesus Paid It All” is a marvelous exhibit of God assembling various talents over time to orchestrate something beautiful and powerful: a song of our complete redemption.\n\nEssay by Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nJesus Paid It All by Elvina M. Hall\n\nI hear the Savior say,\n“Thy strength indeed is small,\nChild of weakness, watch and pray,\nFind in Me thine all in all.”\n\nJesus paid it all,\n All to Him I owe;\nSin had left a crimson stain,\nHe washed it white as snow.\n\nLord, now indeed I find\nThy pow’r and Thine alone,\nCan change the leper’s spots\nAnd melt the heart of stone. \n\nFor nothing good have I\nWhereby Thy grace to claim;\nI’ll wash my garments white\nIn the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb. \n\nAnd when, before the throne,\nI stand in Him complete,\n“Jesus died my soul to save,”\nMy lips shall still repeat.\n\n              ",

One of the many was the hymn-writing career of Johnson Oatman, Jr. \n\nHe wrote 5,000 hymns during his lifetime, a handful widely regarded as standards: “Higher Ground,” “No, Not One!,” and “Count Your Many Blessings.” That final example was first published in a songbook for young people. It is considered to be Oatman’s opus. One critic said: “Like a beam of sunlight it has brightened up the dark places of the earth.”\n\nThe Sunday nights of my childhood were spent in church, hemmed in among the waistlines of good Baptists. The feeling was laid back, no strict order of service like the morning. Often the song leader would loosen his tie and ask us for our favorite hymns. We Baptists didn’t bet, but some voice crying out “Count Your Many Blessings” was a sure thing, every time.\n\nOn those easy-like-Sunday evenings, the last half of that hymn’s chorus held a temptation too great for a song leader to resist: congregational participation. He’d always surrender. He would gradually slow us during that high E-flat “Count your blessings,” followed by the descending “name them one by one.” Then he’d bring us up full stop, still as sheep. He’d grin and say, “Now I know one of you has a blessing to count.” A grateful voice would rise, followed by another, and then another. And we would name them, always surprised at what the Lord had done, every time.\n\nEssay by John Blase\n\nCount Your Blessings by Johnson Oatman, Jr.\n\nWhen upon life’s billows you are tempest tossed,\nWhen you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,\nCount your many blessings, name them one by one,\nAnd it will surprise you what the Lord hath done. \n\nCount your blessings, name them one by one;\nCount your blessings, see what God hath done;\nCount your blessings, name them one by one;\nCount your many blessings, see what God hath done.\n\nAre you ever burdened with a load of care?\nDoes the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?\nCount your many blessings, ev’ry doubt will fly,\nAnd you will be singing as the days go by. \n\nWhen you look at others with their lands and gold,\nThink that Christ has promised you His wealth untold;\nCount your many blessings, money cannot buy\nYour reward in heaven, nor your home on high.\n\nSo, amid the conflict, whether great or small,\nDo not be discouraged, God is over all;\nCount your many blessings, angels will attend,\nHelp and comfort give you to your journey’s end.\n\n              ",

In a time when few black men were afforded the luxury of travel, John Jr. performed for Queen Victoria.\n\nIt took three generations of Works men over 70 years of field research, transcription, and publishing to put together a wide collection of African American spirituals which otherwise could have been lost to history. It was in this collection that John Jr. became the first to publish the hymn “Go Tell It on the Mountain.”\n\nThis hymn, like other spirituals of the era, had previously been communicated through singing only.

Work \n\nGo, tell it on the mountain,\nover the hills and everywhere;\ngo, tell it on the mountain\nthat Jesus Christ is born.\n\nWhile shepherds kept their watching\no’er silent flocks by night,\nbehold, throughout the heavens\nthere shone a holy light.\n\nThe shepherds feared and trembled\nwhen lo! above the earth\nrang out the angel chorus\nthat hailed our Savior‘s birth.\n\nDown in a lowly stable\nthe humble Christ was born,\nand God sent us salvation\nthat blessed Christmas morn.\n\n              ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    This simple hymn is a Trojan horse filled with doctrine. It lays out the effects of believing in the sacrifice of Jesus, hiding those truths in the hearts of those who sing them. And a great many have. This hymn by Lewis Edgar Jones has appeared in hundreds of hymnals down through the years and is still widely known and sung today.\n\nLewis Jones graduated from the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, then went to work for the Young Men’s Christian Association, better known as the YMCA. Jones wore many hats in his role with the YMCA, including organizing camps for those young men. Hymn writing was something he considered more of a side project. Often writing under pseudonyms, Jones wrote not to gain fame but to serve his campers.\n\nIt was during a camp meeting in Mountain Lake Park, Maryland, that Jones wrote both the lyrics and melody for “There Is Power in the Blood.” The simple song served a simple purpose: to remind the singer that he is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ alone—not by anything he himself does.\n\nSince that camp meeting, countless believers, young and old, have sung the song around campfires everywhere, proclaiming the ways the blood of Christ rescues sinners: \n\nIt frees us from the burden of sin and secures our victory over it. \nIt works against our pride even as it cleanses us of guilt. \nIt purifies us and calls us to praise Jesus for His generous grace.\n\nUsing repetition, rhyme, and imagery, Jones’s song clarifies what it means to trust in Christ. Listen as the refrain unpacks the glorious truth: There’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nEssay by Russ Ramsey\n\nThere Is Power in the Blood by Lewis Edgar Jones\n\nWould you be free from the burden of sin?\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\nWould you o’er evil a victory win?\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nThere is power, power, wonder-working power\nIn the blood of the Lamb.\nThere is power, power, wonder-working power\nIn the precious blood of the Lamb.\n\nWould you be free from your passion and pride?\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\nCome for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide;\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood. \n\nWould you be whiter, much whiter than snow?\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\nSin stains are lost in its life-giving flow;\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nWould you do service for Jesus your King?\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\nWould you live daily His praises to sing?\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\n           ",

Her family was so poor that when baby Fanny got a simple eye infection at six weeks old, they were unable to help her, resulting in the loss of her vision before she was even weaned. Still, she grew to be one of the most prolific hymn writers in America. Over the course of her 94 years, Fanny Crosby wrote well over 8,000 gospel songs. Given that she used more than 200 pen names, there may well be many more.\n\nFanny often composed lyrics to music written by friends. She just had a knack for it. But Fanny had standards, and wouldn’t write lyrics to just any old tune. Sometimes musicians would bring music from a saloon song and propose that she sanctify the lyrics. At this proposition, Fanny crossed her dignified ankles and declared, “Oh my, no.” She maintained that the Church must never sing its songs to the melodies of the world.\n\nOne of her dearest musician friends was Phoebe Knapp. And as poor as Fanny was, Phoebe was rich. She was born into the Brooklyn elite, and enjoyed the advantages of great wealth. These two very different women attended the same church and struck up a dear friendship. You could say Fanny’s favorite frolic was the philharmonics at Phoebe’s fancy flat. (But be careful.)\n\nOne afternoon, Phoebe sat at the piano and played a song of her own devising while Fanny listened quietly. As the story goes, when the music ended, Fanny clapped her hands and declared, “Why, that says ‘Blessed Assurance!'” And so the hymn was born.\n\nOur assurance in Christ is indeed blessed. He promises us simply and truly that “Anyone who believes has eternal life” (John 6:47).\n\nEssay by Rebecca Faires\n\nBlessed Assurance by Fanny Crosby\n\nBlessed assurance; Jesus is mine!\nOh, what a foretaste of glory divine!\nHeir of salvation, purchase of God,\nborn of His Spirit, washed in his blood.\n\nThis is my story, this is my song,\npraising my Savior all the day long;\nthis is my story, this is my song,\npraising my Savior all the day long.\n\nPerfect submission, perfect delight,\nvisions of rapture now burst on my sight;\nangels descending bring from above\nechoes of mercy, whispers of love. \n\nPerfect submission, all is at rest,\nI in my Savior am happy and blest;\nwatching and waiting, looking above,\nfilled with His goodness, lost in His love.\n\n               ",

This second kind requires vulnerability and intimacy, trust and the laying down of self. Finding unity with others takes work as well as risk. It is something we celebrate because it is both rare and good.\n\nReflect\n\n1. Is there someone from your past or present with whom you need to pursue reconciliation—someone you need to move toward in love? In what ways do you “behold how unpleasant it is” to dwell in disunity?\n\n2. What are some of the best ways you can actively pursue Christian community? Why is it important to cultivate spiritual friendships?\n\n3. This psalm describes our unity with one another as something that carries over into eternity. How does regarding our spiritual friendships as eternal relationships help us love each other? Forgive each other? Respect each other?\n\n                ",

But rather than return to a remembered past, he looks forward to a better future glory.\n\nIn the first half of this song (vv.1-10), God’s people cry out for God to repeat something He did before, about which they hold idealized memories. In the second half (vv.11-18), God beckons them to lift their eyes from the romantic fog of nostalgia and stop wishing for the past. Our security does not lie in a bygone era, but in an ongoing relationship with an eternal God.\n\nReflect\n\n1. Are there any seasons in your past you wish you could return to? Why?\n\n2. In his essay “The Weight of Glory,” C. S. Lewis describes nostalgia as “only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.” When we long to go back to a remembered time, or when we look forward to better days, what are we ultimately longing for?\n\n3.

This frees us to not only be at peace with our limitations, but to actually extol their virtues.\n\nReflect\n\n1.In your experience, what does the world say must be true about you for you to have worth?\n\n2.

If God were to hold our sin against us, we could not enter into His presence. But God’s mercy beckons us to come to Him. The God who forgives is to be revered and trusted. We depend on God, and in Christ He gives us everything we need to know Him and worship Him without fear.\n\nReflect\n\n1. The opening verse of this psalm has an urgency to it. The pilgrim-disciple is asking the Lord to hear his cries for mercy. What is typically your most urgent prayer? Why?\n\n2. Do you believe your sin makes it so that, apart from God’s mercy, you could not stand before Him? Do you believe He shows mercy and forgives? Why or why not?\n\n3.

We should want evil eradicated from the world and we should ask God to do it—not simply because we loathe how bad it can be, but because there is something even higher we want: peace.

As Eugene Peterson said, we are pilgrims, but we are also disciples—always moving and always learning. The Psalms of Ascent (Psalms 120-134) were sung by worshipers as they made the journey up to Jerusalem for the annual feasts. In this 3-week reading plan, we are digging into these traveling songs with the help of short summary essays and thoughtful, reflective questions for each psalm. Take your pack on your shoulder and walk with us as we pursue God together.\n\n//\n\nPsalm ISRAEL’S STABILITY\n\nA song of ascents.\n\n1 Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion.\n\nIt cannot be shaken; it remains forever.\n\n2 The mountains surround Jerusalem\n\nand the LORD surrounds his people,\n\nboth now and forever.\n\n3 The scepter of the wicked will not remain\n\nover the land allotted to the righteous,\n\nso that the righteous will not apply their hands to injustice.\n\n4 Do what is good, LORD, to the good,\n\nto those whose hearts are upright.\n\n5 But as for those who turn aside to crooked ways,\n\nthe LORD will banish them with the evildoers.\n\nPeace be with Israel.\n\n//\n\nA Song of Belonging\n\nThe pilgrim-disciple sings of our security in God’s care. The Lord holds His scepter, and no one can wrest it from His hand.\n\nThis is a humble song because it acknowledges the truth that our hope is secure—not because we are strong, but because God is. But in this song, we also confess that we need God’s intervention to keep us and hold us. We are likely to take up the scepter of wickedness and govern our own lives in evil, self-serving ways if He doesn’t stay our hand.\n\nReflect\n\n1. Do you worry about ruining your life by making a wrong decision or committing a particular transgression? How fragile or stable do you think your own life is? Why?\n\n2.

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Death is final. It is the end—inevitable and unavoidable. Death is the last, worst enemy.\n\nThose of us who are followers of Jesus know that a resurrection will come. We have hope in a future after death, like Mary did when her brother Lazarus died and she said she knew he’d rise again on the last day. That is a comfort, but it does little to remove the sting of death now. In this life, death is an irreversible loss that creates a vacuum in our lives where a person used to be.\n\nBut perhaps we misunderstand the resurrection. Maybe the resurrection is not merely an event at some undetermined future time.\n\nConsider these stories.\n\nJesus was summoned to heal a gravely ill little girl. On His way, He stopped to heal a suffering woman; and when He arrived at the girl’s house, she had already passed. “She is not dead but asleep,” He announced (Matthew 9:24). Then He took her by the hand and raised her more easily than if she had been napping.\n\nOn His way to the town of Nain, Jesus passed a funeral procession. The man who had died was the only son of a widow, her caretaker in old age. She was utterly alone. Jesus felt compassion for her, so He spoke a word, and the young man sat up and was reunited with his mother (Luke 7:15). From death to life with a word.\n\nAnd when Lazarus, Jesus’ dear friend, died, Jesus waited four days to arrive so that God’s glory could be revealed and people could see something essential to Jesus’ person and mission: “I am the resurrection and the life” (John 11:25).\n\nJesus declares that He is the resurrection. He embodies the resurrection and brings it to us. He gives the resurrection. When Mary offers her meager hope that her brother will rise one day, Jesus declares the resurrection to be something present—someone present.\n\nThis all sounds victorious and glorious—which it is—but on His way to the tomb, Jesus wept. He wept with and for the grief of others. He wept at the wreckage death caused. He wept because He knew loss. Then He walked to the tomb and showed death that its days were numbered, uttering, “Lazarus, come out!” (John 11:43).\n\nThe resurrection is yet to come. But the resurrection has also already come. It has been proven by Christ’s dismissal of death with words and actions. \n\nYes, death still hurts. It comes for us all, but we have more than a meager hope in a distant day. We have the resurrection Himself. \n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

It’s not so much a tactic I use to gain their attention as much as it is my way of displaying empathy and connection. While our society moves further away from such physical acts of affection in our relationships with one another, we see this was not the case with our Lord Jesus. The Gospel writers highlight that Jesus often touched the people He healed.\n\nIn Mark chapter 1, we come across two healing accounts in which Jesus incorporated touch into the act of healing. It wasn’t that Jesus needed to touch those who were weighed down with illness; His was showing Himself to be the compassionate and empathetic Savior.\n\nIn this way, Jesus related to the suffering of those who needed Him.\n\nWhen Peter’s mother-in-law lay sick, Jesus “came and took her by the hand and raised her up, and immediately the fever left her” (Mark 1:30-31). It is not difficult for us to recognize the warmth and affection of this act. This was the mother of His beloved disciple’s wife. He cared about her, and He treated her with affection by touching her.\n\nThe second miracle account in Mark 1 magnifies this act of touch even more. Mark tells us a leper came and knelt down before Jesus and begged Jesus to heal him. Jesus  “stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, ‘I am willing; be cleansed’” (vv.40-41). \n\nAccording to the law, this act made Jesus ceremonially unclean. This miracle with the leper is a supreme demonstration of compassion for those subject to one the most painful miseries of this fallen world. Leprosy made a man both ceremonially and socially unclean. Lepers were not allowed to come into contact with others. Imagine not being able to touch another person—in some cases, for decades. This isolation is a symbolic picture of the effects of the uncleanness of our sin. Yet Jesus touched the leper in the act of healing him. \n\nIn order for something unclean to become clean, something clean had to become unclean. Jesus was made unclean on the cross. He was treated as a spiritual leper at Calvary. \n\nGod the Father “made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:21). On the cross, Jesus took the sins of the lepers and the isolated—of all of us—upon Himself. He did so willingly, so that His touch might heal us.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

She knows she is not allowed on the couch, but doesn’t seem to hear me when I tell her to stay off the furniture. And she’s just one small example of how my words don’t always get their way. \n\nDid you see the authority of Christ’s voice in today’s passages? When He speaks, sickness and disabilities obey. Power, comfort, and hope are found in the words of King Jesus.\n\nMany of Jesus’ miracles dealt with chronic pain, decades-long illnesses, disabilities, and diseases. These things remain discouraging realities of living in a sin-stained world. But they will not last forever. \n\nJesus is Lord over all. He can speak to fractured muscle tissue and busted cells and command them to work again, and they obey. He can untangle what is mangled. If He can calm a Galilean thunderstorm, surely He can calm a misfiring nervous system too. He can command diseases to return to the dust, no matter how long-standing the sickness or disability. He may heal our bodies right away, or thirty-eight years into our ailment, or when that last trumpet sounds—but He will heal. \n\nWe need to know and believe that the Lord is our healer. The empty tomb tells us not to doubt His ability to overrule what plagues our bodies.\n\nWe might be full of hope and faith when a diagnosis is fresh off the doctor’s lips. But as time ticks by, it’s not uncommon for our hope of healing to fade, along with our faith in God’s love for us. But the length of our suffering does not limit our Lord’s ability to restore our bodies, and the presence of pain doesn’t dismiss God’s love for us. \n\nThe cross is still real. The tomb is still empty. His power rests on us. \n\n“But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is perfected in weakness.’ Therefore, I will most gladly boast all the more about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may reside in me” (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\nOur weaknesses do not reign over us. Christ reigns. He always reigns over His people. Hear the authority in His voice in these passages. Every healing we see in the Gospels is a time portal to our resurrection and our lives in the new earth. \n\nJesus will heal us. Completely. It’s only a matter of time.\n\nWritten by J. A.

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    It was a Tuesday, about 5 years ago. A few of us were gathered in a friend’s apartment, anticipating what was sure to be an all-out taco smorgasbord. This had become a semi-regular tradition of ours. In preparation for our feast, each of us took on a different job. Some of us were prepping and cooking fish and chicken, others were frying up the tortillas, and a few of us (myself included) were chopping the veggies.\n\nLost in conversation and laughter, I diced the onions, tomatoes, and jalapeno peppers. But somewhere along the way, my laughter was cut short. That’s because my face and eyes felt like they were on fire. Note well: a jalapeno seed or two in the eye will pretty much ruin your day.\n\nNo matter how much water or milk I flushed through my eyes, I couldn’t see a single thing; there was only tears and stinging. Man, I was so frustrated. That Taco Tuesday was undoubtedly ruined for me.\n\nIt’s difficult for me to fathom the isolation and frustration that must come with blindness. I hesitate to even compare the temporary suffering I experienced that evening with the true difficulty the man in John 9 had faced his entire life. But I will say that even being temporarily without the use of my eyes was completely disorienting. My experience of that entire night was changed, and through no fault of their own, I really felt disconnected from my friends.\n\nMany in Jesus’ day assumed that the blind man in today’s text was blind because either he or his parents had sinned (John 9:1-2). While I was certainly to blame for not paying attention while chopping that jalapeno, this man had done nothing to cause the blindness he was experiencing. Jesus certainly knew that and wanted to set the record straight (John 9:3).\n\nWhat’s really interesting about this account is that, so far as we can tell, Jesus chose to heal the blind man without his request or a direct confession of faith. Many other times in the Gospels we see Jesus bring miraculous healing to someone who cries out for it, or someone who confesses a deep faith in Him. But that’s not the case here. I think we witness this healing for another reason altogether.\n\nThe text tells us this miracle was performed first and foremost “that the works of God might be displayed” (John 9:3). It’s no coincidence that just a few verses earlier, we see Jesus boldly proclaiming His own divinity: “Before Abraham was, I AM” (John 8:58). The very next thing He does is demonstrate His divine power through this miraculous healing. \n\nCertainly Jesus cared deeply for the blind man, as He cares for all of us. However, in addition to setting aright that which is upside down or broken in our lives, miracles also remind us of the power and goodness of God. This is why the blind man couldn’t help but confess, “I believe, Lord” (John 9:38).\n\nMiracles are moments when God breaks into our dying world and sets things right. They are evidence that Jesus’ power and status are equal with the Father’s. They give us hope for belief and fresh eyes with which to see the world. \n\nWhen we encounter miracles, no matter how big or how small, they are moments for us to declare again, “I believe, Lord! I believe.” \n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    A little over 10 years ago I hurt my back. I’m not sure how it happened. All I know is I went downhill fast. Nothing helped. I tried physical therapy. I tried everything until one day my doctor said I needed an MRI. Sure enough, I had a ruptured disc. For weeks I was in so much pain I could not lie down or stand up. I was using a golf club as a cane. I resisted painkillers, but for those last few days before the surgery, my doctor insisted. They were so strong I lived in a haze.\n\nI can remember meeting with the doctor before the surgery and being told how serious the condition was. But I also distinctly remember hearing how I would be free from pain as soon as I woke up. I’d been in pain for so long, I had trouble believing him.\n\nThe first thing I remember doing when I woke up was moving my feet. “They work. I’m not paralyzed.” And then I noticed I didn’t hurt. I was lying down flat on my back and there was no excruciating pain. For months after my surgery, people would remark on how different I looked. My response was that it was “like a miracle.” It felt like mercy. The difference between my life before the surgery and my life after was stark.\n\nWhat gets lost in all the questions surrounding Jesus’ casting out demons is the mercy He is showing to those who need freedom. Most of the questions people ask about Jesus’ frequent practice of this particular miracle are valid questions. But sometimes, we miss the forest of His mercy for the trees of excursive questioning.\n\nThese stories are so remarkable to me because I know what my reaction would be toward demon-possessed people: judgment and fear. But Jesus is different. Regardless of how they came to Him, He showed them mercy. That mercy changed them, and the difference was stark. Jesus looked into the eyes of people who were cursing Him, and with a word, mercifully delivered them from their torment.\n\nWhen the father comes to Jesus in Matthew 17 and says, “Lord, have mercy on my son” (v.15), Jesus shows him mercy. The reason is simple: Jesus wants us to know that when we go to Him begging for mercy, He is not only willing to give it, but He also has the power to give it.\n\nYou can draw a straight line from these miracles to the cross. The mercy Jesus shows in casting out demons who cause people to curse Him, fear Him, and want nothing to do with Him, points directly to the mercy shown to sinners who were once slaves to sin—enemies of God wanting nothing to do with Him. The power of Christ’s mercy is so great that, for those who experience it, life is starkly different from what it was before.\n\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

He has powers!” said my daughter at the breakfast table, not long after I’d read her a story of Jesus performing a miracle. “No,” I explained. “Jesus doesn’t have powers. He has power. He rules over creation. Miracles aren’t magic; they reveal the true order of things.”\n\nJesus rules over nature as Lord and Master, as Creator and King. He sleeps in a boat in high seas because He has nothing to fear from the sea. It obeys His command and leaves His disciples in awe. All it takes is a word and the rowdy waters retreat to their proper place.\n\nHe walks on the very waves He calmed as if they are terra firma, and He does so as His disciples thrash at their oars trying to row through. While we might know this story, we ought not count ourselves as too familiar with it. How can we be familiar with something we have never seen or even been able to fully imagine? He walked on water. He broke the laws of nature. What is that about? \n\nThese natural laws to which we are bound do not apply to the One who created nature from nothing.\n\nWe see this again when Jesus could not find figs on a tree, so He withered it with a word. Was He being spiteful? Was He mad at the tree? No. When you read the story you see He was making a point to His disciples about believing.\n\nAnother time, when Jesus owed a tax, He sent Peter to go catch a fish. Its mouth held money enough to cover both their taxes. How did the coin get there? How did Jesus know? How did Peter pull just that one particular fish from the sea? (I’d ask why the fish ate a coin, but if you’ve ever been fishing with a Daredevle® lure, you know they bite shiny metal.) The answer is this: Nature—from weather to water to plants to beasts—is at the command of its Creator.\n\nThrough these miracle stories, three sentences guide us:\n\n“Who then is this?”\n“Have courage! It is I!”\n“Have faith.”\n\nWe must reflect daily on who this Jesus is, the Man who sleeps through storms then calms them with a rebuke. We must take courage because His miracles reveal His nature. He is Lord. He is powerful. He rules. For this reason we can have faith and live in it. \n\nMiracles were not acts of magic or a show of powers. They were moments of revelation of who Jesus is, so we can know the One in whom our faith rests.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The year was 2001. A relatively unknown writer named Leif Enger released a book titled Peace Like A River. It is one of my favorites. In the first few pages some truths are laid down about miracles, real miracles. One that has stuck with me since my first reading is this: “No miracle happens without a witness. Someone to declare, Here’s what I saw. Here’s how it went. Make of it what you will.”\n\nThe miracles presented in today’s texts are not cut from the spectacular. The sun did not suddenly stand still; no dead bodies rubbed their eyes and woke up; no men walked fluidly across the surface of the sea. No, these miracles deal with the multiplication of the mundane, the stuff of earth like bread and fish and wine. But because they were still miracles, there were witnesses ranging from the disciples to the curious onlookers. And while they may not have taken the witnesses’ breath away, these miracles definitely left them satisfied.\n\nThe fact that Christ took time out of His busy schedule of saving the world to focus on common things like food and drink can be a comfort to most of us, for most of us don’t live in the world of the spectacular. Oh, it’s possible we do in our dreams, but for most of us our waking moments are filled with what one writer called “the precious ordinary.” But you see, it is in the very ordinariness of our lives that Christ often does the extraordinary, if—and this is a big “if”—we’re paying attention. In other words, if we’re doing the job each and every one of us is called to do: to be witnesses.\n\nHere’s the deal. Jesus may not miraculously multiply the food in your fridge. But He may nudge your neighbor to bring over two dozen of the eggs His hens just laid. And the conversation the two of you have in that moment, which usually has all the zing of a cheap bottle of red, may strangely warm into something that feels aged, vintage even. \n\nWould those be classified as modern-day miracles? Well, they might be if someone was paying attention, if someone was there to witness them, to stand knee-deep in the ordinary and declare, “Here’s what I saw. Here’s how it went. Make of it what you will.” \n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

Traffic cops, airport screeners, elected officials, college professors, and even hosts at restaurants all wield power. When you need special consideration, they can shut you down or wave you through. Some people use their power for good, while others might sometimes seem to use it for evil.\n\nHow we use power reveals what is in our character. Jesus’ miracles show us who He is.\n\nWhat do we learn about Jesus’ character when we look at His miracles? As He shows us He is the Christ, what sort of Messiah do we find Him to be? As He reveals His power, what does He channel that power toward? As He familiarizes us with His Kingdom, what sort of a monarchy is it, and what can be expected of its ruler?\n\nIn yesterday’s reading, we looked at why Jesus performed miracles. He performed signs and wonders to show us He is the Messiah. They revealed His glory and His power. They proved His claim that His Kingdom was not of this world and that He had brought His Kingdom to us. \n\nThat is all well and good. Stories of gods showing mortals their power and glory are nothing new. Greek mythology is full of tales like these—gods flexing their muscles to remind the mortals not to think too highly of themselves.\n\nSome of Jesus’ miracles are meant to instill in us a holy humility. When He commands creation and it obeys His voice, eye-witnesses do not tend to give each other fist bumps. They usually tremble in fear. His power is strong. But when we see the way Jesus uses His miracles to interact with people in need, we see that the character of Christ is filled with mercy, compassion, and generosity.\n\nWhen He casts out demons, He shows mercy to tormented people living miserable lives. The One who overcomes evil does so to care for those afflicted by it. When Jesus opens blind eyes, or reanimates paralyzed legs, or cleanses lepers, restoring them to community, we see a Messiah who uses His power to heal, comfort, and encourage, rather than smite, dominate, and humiliate.\n\nJesus’ miracles serve a dual purpose: they call us to fear Him but also to trust Him—to trust that He is good. Jesus uses signs and wonders to cultivate in us a holy reverence for His power and a confidence in His affection. \n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_title": "Why Did Jesus Perform Miracles?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    When I was about 10 years old, a high-school-aged guy would often play baseball with us. We were always amazed at his ability. To us, he was like Ken Griffey, Jr. in the flesh.\n\nOne day I was standing too close while he was at the plate. He took a huge swing at the ball, and his backswing whipped around and connected solidly with the side of my head. The blunt force was so hard that it broke the skin and fractured the bone above my ear. Even so, I only spent one night in the hospital. It felt like a miracle that I wasn’t hurt worse.\n\nWe can all relate to “miracles” like this, can’t we—lucky breaks where the unexpected happens? But Jesus’ miracles were true miracles. \n\nWhy did He perform them? What was Jesus after when He performed signs and wonders?\n\nJesus’ miracles set Him apart. He wasn’t just an illusionist, some sort of precursor to David Blaine. Jesus’ miracles were real and they showed people who He was. They revealed that He was the Messiah. They revealed His glory. And they revealed that God’s Kingdom had come to earth. \n\nLet’s look a closer at each of these.\n\nFirst, Jesus’ miracles revealed He was the Messiah. The Old Testament had spoken of the Messiah who would come and bring an end to sin and death (Isaiah 61:1-3). In Matthew 11:2-5, John the Baptist asks Jesus if He truly is the Messiah. Jesus’ response? “Sin and death are already being pushed back because people are being healed and resuscitated” (my paraphrase). When John asked if Jesus was the Messiah, Jesus pointed to His miracles as proof.\n\nSecond, Jesus’ miracles revealed His glory. In John 2:11 we read that the disciples believed in Him because they saw His glory through His miracle of turning water into wine. They knew this was more than a magic trick or a nice turn of events (like a one-night stay in the hospital). It was plain to them that His miracles were otherworldly—that He must have come from above.\n\nFinally, Jesus’ miracles revealed that God’s Kingdom had come to earth. For sin and death to be defeated, God Himself would have to step in and clean up our mess. Jesus did just that. As He Himself said, “If I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you” (Matthew 12:28). When sin and death are being pushed back, it’s clear that God is at work in our midst.\n\nJesus’ miracles are not chance, luck, or good fortune. They’re the power of God. And they are bringing us all the way home to New Jerusalem (Revelation 21-22).\n\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The Bible is full of miracles, isn’t it? Cover to cover—it’s miracles, miracles, miracles. Right?\n\nNot really, no. The fact that there are miracles in the Bible—quite a number of them, really—could leave you with the impression that they happened all the time back then. But they didn’t. They were actually quite rare. Hundreds of years would pass without a single miraculous moment. But when they did happen, they often came in bursts. Why is that?\n\nToday’s texts lead us through a sampling of miracles from the earlier parts of Scripture. After today, this two-week study of the miracles of Jesus will focus specifically on the signs and wonders He performed during His earthly ministry. But we begin this series with the simplest question we could ask: What is a miracle?\n\nA miracle is an historical event or phenomenon which surpasses human or natural power and cannot be explained by natural or scientific laws, and is therefore considered a display of divine power caused by God. It is a supernatural interference with the natural order of things.\n\nWhy are miracles in the Bible? Biblical miracles show God’s power and His grace. They show His presence and His judgment. They illuminate His plan to accomplish our salvation. Today’s readings illustrate these points.\n\nMiracles are one of the ways God expresses His “otherness” to us. They reveal Him in His power, and show us He is not like us. The rules of nature that bind us do not bind Him. The laws of a created world are amendable by the One Who created it.\n\nWhy do miracles seem to appear in clusters? When you come upon an era in Scripture with a high concentration of miracles—like the Exodus or the conquest of Canaan or the life and ministry of Jesus—pay attention. God is showing His power, His grace, His salvation, His judgment, and His presence in ways that point to the fact that He is doing something special in that moment in time.\n\nIn the case of Jesus’ miracles, we come to see that God’s presence and Christ’s presence are one in the same. All the power, grace, salvation, judgment, and compassionate care Jesus shows us through His miracles come from the God who created us and governs the world in which we live. \n\nGod and His Son Jesus are not subject to creation. Creation is subject to Them. Because that is the case, what can separate us from the love of God in Christ? Romans 8 tells us nothing can—nothing in all creation. \n\nAs we study the miracles of Jesus, remember that these are nothing less than acts of God performed by Immanuel, “God with us.” Although signs and wonders may not accompany every moment of our lives, the One who makes them possible does.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

When he senses I am struggling, he asks me about it, and I do the same with him. This way of caring for each other isn’t work. It is the natural result of our friendship. We are not friends in name only. We are friends, and therefore we make that friendship known by reaching out to one another. Our relationship makes us respond to each other.\n\nThe Beatitudes offer comfort amidst the difficulties we face. They speak into our struggles and promise hope. But when we read the verses that follow the Beatitudes, we see that we are not meant to simply know this information. We are meant to proclaim it. What the Beatitudes tell us should draw from us a response.\n\nJesus follows the Beatitudes by telling us we are the salt of the earth, lamps on stands, cities up on hills. We are to let our light shine so that people will see us and praise God because of what they see in us. In other words, the comfort and confidence the Beatitudes promise should draw from us a response of gratitude to God that serves as our witness to the world.\n\nThis is how gratitude works, right? Real gratitude, anyway. We don’t just think about the things we’re most thankful for. We talk about them. We tell people. We share stories of how blessings seemed to come out of nowhere, and just in time, too. It’s almost impossible not to talk about the things we love the most.\n\nYou’ll be hard-pressed to find any theological truth that is simply meant to be heard and filed away under “general information.” God calls us to live not only as recipients of His kindness, but to proclaim His mercy and grace to others.\n\nIn fact, Jesus says it just doesn’t make any sense not to. It would be like putting your lamp under a basket so that the light doesn’t get out. Or hiding the salt during a meal so that there is nothing to draw out flavor and complexity—to make known to the senses what is there.\n\nIn Christ’s kingdom, the meek inherit the earth. The mourners are comforted. Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will not be disappointed. The merciful are shown mercy. The peacemakers and the persecuted will see God and find peace. The Beatitudes are not mere bits of information. They present a message, and we, if we understand them, are meant to be messengers. Light in a dark world. Salt for bland imaginations. We are meant to respond. It would be strange not to.\n\nMay the world see the light of the gospel shine through us as we live according to the hope Jesus gives us in the Beatitudes.\n\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    This past month, 322 Christians around the globe were martyred for their faith.\n\nThis past month, 214 churches and Christian properties across the earth were destroyed.\n\nIn the past 5 years, the Christian population of Iraq has been cut down from 1.5 million to 300,000. Christians there have either been martyred or they’ve fled the country under great duress, fearing for their families’ lives. That’s an 80% population decrease.\n\nIt’s hard to wrap our heads around global Christian suffering if we don’t necessarily experience it firsthand. But we need to carefully reflect upon Paul’s words to the Philippians. To be of “one mind” and “one spirit” means to share in one another’s victories and sufferings (Philippians 1:27). To know Christ is to be intimately connected to His body, the Church. When our Christian brothers and sisters rejoice, we rejoice. But where they suffer, we must lament, and lend every help that we possibly can. \n\n“Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake… Blessed are you when others revile and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account” (Matthew 5:10-11).\n\nIt seems clear that Jesus carefully and intentionally made this proclamation on the heels of verse 9: “Blessed are the peacemakers…” While we all are called to actively engage in the work of peacemaking, this does not guarantee earthly peace. In seeking peace, followers of Christ are blessed and so is the world around them. But not everyone will respond to our invitations and actions in kind.\n\nJesus offers assurance and comfort for His followers: the persecuted will be blessed. While the world offers indifference, or at times outright hostility, the promise of this beatitude is that those who suffer will be lifted up, in this life or the next. The suffering, the persecuted, the downtrodden may not always receive immediate, visible justice, but the heart of Jesus’ teaching is that God sees them all and promises that they will be blessed.\n\nThere is no suffering so great that He cannot heal it. There is no difficulty so trivial that His heart does not bear it with us.\n\nThe earliest Christians helped to faithfully establish the Church in the midst of great suffering. They were following in the footsteps of our Lord and Savior, who redeemed the world through His own persecution, suffering, and sacrificial death. To follow Jesus is to take up our crosses.\n\nThere is victory and eternal glory in following Jesus. But that doesn’t mean that there won’t be trials in this life. In fact, it usually means quite the opposite.\n\nI find it very challenging to be thankful for suffering or trials. Yet I know that when we encounter difficulties for the name of Christ, we participate in Kingdom work with Him. We are not alone in those moments. Rather, we are united to Christ and His body in a mystery that stretches far beyond our understanding. For that mystery, and that intimacy, we can and should be thankful. It’s not an easy posture to adopt, but it is a mode of thinking and living that will bring a sense of internal peace as we face difficult moments. \n\nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    If there’s thing we can count on in life, it’s conflict. Whether we’re looking at international affairs, local neighborhoods, church communities, or family relations, it seems the prophet Jeremiah said it best: “We looked for peace, but no good came; for a time of healing, but behold, terror” (Jeremiah 8:15).\n\nIsn’t it true that when one conflict is resolved, another one arises in its place? It’s as if there’s a thread of unrest that’s woven into fabric of the world—woven even into our very hearts and lives. For even when no great conflict threatens us, still an uneasy disquiet lurks within.\n\nThe reason for this, the Bible tells us, is that Adam and Eve’s sin in the garden of Eden sent out shockwaves of conflict through every sphere of the cosmos. It’s seen in Genesis 3, in Adam and Eve’s hiding from God and in the shame they felt toward one another in their nakedness. But the shockwaves turned violent in Genesis 4, when Cain rose up against His brother Abel and murdered him. \n\nSin lies at the root of every conflict.\n\nBut we’re called not to be people who contribute to the “disturbance in the force” by continuing to sin. Instead, we are to make peace. \n\nWhat is peace? Is it a feeling, as the Eagles led us to believe in 1972 with their hit song, “Peaceful Easy Feeling”? As nice as peaceful feelings can be at times, you and I both know that an emotional high is not sustainable. We need something more. We need a peace with substance, strength, and staying power. In a word, we need shalom—the great peace that comes from the flowering of salvation.\n\nThis is what Jesus came to bring, and He did it in the most unlikely way—through death. Like a lamb led to the slaughter, the Prince of Peace came to earth to enter the conflict that we deserved. We should have been pierced for our transgressions. We should have been crushed for our iniquities. But He was instead. He took our place in the conflict and received the blows on our behalf that we might have peace with God (Isaiah 53:5). That the glorious truth of the gospel!\n\nYou will never make peace until the peace that Jesus made begins to make you. You’ll never experience the peace of being called a son of God until you trust in the peace made by the Son of God Himself. Truth is, Jesus is the only real peacemaker. But, in Him, we can be peacemakers, too.  \n\nWritten By Nate Shurden \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    My three-year-old daughter is a sweet kid. She has always been playful yet reserved, sensitive yet affectionate. But since she’s now three, she’s getting smarter and she’s learning to manipulate. I’ve heard the same joke a million times, and now I understand it: “If you don’t believe we’re born sinful, just have a kid.” Indeed!\n\nThough my daughter is a joy and I love to believe that she is totally innocent, she is also a daughter of Adam. She sometimes battles me when I discipline her. She often talks back when she’s cranky. She can be selfish with other kids. If anyone should be considered “pure in heart,” it’s her, but like I said, she’s Adam’s daughter. And you and I are his sons. As Paul tells us, “just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, in this way death spread to all men, because all sinned” (Romans 5:12). \n\nSin is inevitable. We aren’t pure in heart, even in our best moments.\n\nYet, Jesus tells us here in Matthew 5:8 that the pure in heart are blessed. Because we are born into sin and sin every day, does that mean we are destined to the non-blessing of condemnation? Are we hopeless?\n\nIt seems Jesus is giving us an impossible standard here, and in a sense, He is. When He says, “Blessed are the pure in heart,” it should immediately hit us that we aren’t pure. If we’re not pure, we have to look to someone who is.\n\nThroughout the Beatitudes, Jesus lifts up various virtues. Like the Ten Commandments way back in Exodus, each beatitude stings a little because it reveals our absolute need for God. Though we may portray to others a sense of purity, our inner thoughts and private actions condemn us. No one can live up to the Ten Commandments; no one can live up to the Beatitudes. \n\nNo one except Jesus.\n\nJesus was pure in heart: He never sinned, and He loved (and still loves) perfectly. As the “image of the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15), Jesus carried with Him perfection, and in that perfection, the purest heart to ever walk the face of the earth. The Son of God took on flesh, and He lived with a pure heart so that He could purify the hearts of His people.\n\nThis beatitude emphasizes consistency between who we are in private and who we are in public. The more single-hearted we are before God—privately and publicly—the deeper our delight and desire will be to see our Maker face to face. We love because He loved. We serve because He served. We are pure in God’s sight because He was pure.\n\nMay we look at the face of Jesus with gratitude, for through His pure heart we can pursue purity in our own hearts.\n\nWritten By Brandon D.

Where you stand facing your opponent, reach out and interlock fingers, then when the “go” is spoken you and your opponent twist your hands upside down, trying with all your might to break the other guy’s fingers off at the knuckles? Yeah, essentially a scene from Call of Duty before Xbox came along.\n\nThere’s not a lot of strategy in this game. It is pure strength and will. At some point either you or your opponent will swear tendons are ripping apart, and the weaker player will yell, “Mercy.” But the reality of schoolyard games is sometimes the stronger player will not immediately release. In these cases mercy does come, but it comes slow. You essentially have to beg for it. I remember seeing boys on the ground reduced to tears, pleading.\n\nJames could beat everyone else in our grade, except me. We’d always tie, if there is such a thing in Mercy. But it was a grade-school fact that when other boys would challenge James (and always lose), he would release as soon as the other boy cried out. I wondered about this, until the day I saw James playing this game with some much older boys, boys almost men. They would best James and when he asked for “Mercy” they’d make him grovel. In a sort of reverse parable, my friend knew the power of mercy because he’d not been shown mercy. My friend James did unto others as he wished others would’ve done to him. James was golden like that.    \n\nIn the story that Jesus tells Peter, the servant was shown mercy by the master but then turned around and acted unmercifully toward a peer. He put the screws to his “fellow servant” and finally threw him in jail. When word of this nonsense finally reached the master, well, let’s just say the story didn’t end so happily ever after.\n\nWe learn the power of mercy by having it given or withheld. That’s the reality of schoolyards, and life. Jesus promises a blessedness to our lives if we extend mercy swiftly, without question. Such behavior only truly comes from gratitude. It comes from a thankfulness resulting from our ongoing grappling with the depths of our sin and its collateral damage, as the beautiful word “Mercy” is cried out not by us, but by our Master, once and for all, and again and again. Jesus is golden like that.\n\nWritten By John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    In his Confessions, St. Augustine declared, “Our hearts are restless, Lord, until they find their rest in Thee.” Despite the profound truth of these words, we are quick to look for satisfaction in other places. We search for it in physical or emotional comforts, in popularity, influence and acclaim, in distraction, and in that old temptation of earthly wealth. We forget the words of the preacher who warns, “he who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income. This also is vanity” (Eccl. 5:10).\n\nChrist’s pronouncement of blessing for those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, however, comes with a guarantee of satisfaction. \n\nThe metaphor of hunger and thirst is vivid. It is the picture of ardent desire, of a deep hunger born of starvation, and deep thirst in a dry and weary land. We are bid to cry out, as David does, “earnestly I seek You; my soul thirsts for You; my flesh faints for You” (Psalm 63:1).\n\nI struggle to seek after God with such fervency. As I wrestle with this beatitude, I come face to face with two challenges:\n\nFirst, I often lack a genuine desire for righteousness. My desire for God’s righteousness often flags, especially in seasons of prosperity. But “our desire for spiritual blessings,” says Matthew Henry, “must be earnest.” This entails a deep sorrow for our own sin, a humble recognition of our own lack and need, and a genuine longing for holiness. So then, it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy (Romans 9:16).\n\nSecond, I often misconstrue the nature of true righteousness. I tend to think of righteousness in human terms: how should a righteous man act? In Scripture, however, righteousness really belongs only to God (Ezra 9:15; Daniel 9:7-8). Righteousness is perfect justice, perfect uprightness, holiness. In none of these is righteousness derived of man, his actions, accomplishments, merits, or successes. Christ’s call to hunger and thirst for righteousness is not man-focused, because that is not where we find righteousness (Romans 3:10).\n\nWithout even trying, of course, we can so quickly revert to thinking chiefly of our own righteousness, and to relying on our own spiritual strength. Thomas Chalmers observed: “There are several vexations of the vain show in which I walk and which would cheat me of my eternity.” How much of our walk is but vain show? Is our vain show of the pursuit of righteousness cheating us of eternity? Or, do we genuinely hunger and thirst after God’s righteousness? Do we find in Him all our fulfillment?\n\nMay Christ in His mercy give us a hunger and thirst for His righteousness! Then we will proclaim, “my soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food” and “as for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness” (Psalms 63:5; 17:15).\n\nWritten By Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

I’m trying to read it slow, but I kinda feel like I grew up with this guy. He was on my radio, on the covers of magazines, and front and center on MTV. He has spent a great deal of time in my tape deck and in my CD player. Still does. I have every album and about a dozen bootlegs. He’s taken up residence in my life as a fixture.\n\nWhat’s interesting is to read about what he wanted to get out of his driven lifestyle. There is this one story he tells on his album, Live 1975-85, in the middle of “Growin’ Up.” He talks about how his parents wanted him to be anything but a rock and roll singer. His dad wanted him to be a lawyer and his mom wanted him to be an author. He says they wanted him to be one of these things so that he could “get a little something for himself.” Which made sense because he grew up fairly poor in Freehold, New Jersey. But he said, “the problem was that I wanted everything.”\n\nWhat is strange about the promise of the meek inheriting the earth is that it is the exact opposite of the way our world works. It’s the aggressive and loud and assertive that get the goods in this swift, spinning, ever-changing world.\n\nBlessed are the go-getters. The entrepreneurial. Blessed are the ones who have a little bit of an ego—just enough to want to be great. These are the ones who inherit the brass ring.\n\nJesus’ original listeners would have heard the promise that way. Remember, these were people who were living in a land occupied by the unclean Romans. Their great hope was for the Messiah to come and give them back the earth beneath their feet. I am sure many a Jewish man secretly chastised his own meekness, and the meekness he saw in others, toward the Roman interlopers.\n\nI love the way Eugene Peterson sums up this verse: “You’re blessed when you’re content with just who you are—no more, no less. That’s the moment you find yourselves proud owners of everything that can’t be bought” (Matthew 5:5 MSG).\n\nThe problem is being content with who you are in a world of discontent. This earth is constantly beaming messages at us that are meant to take away any meekness we have and strip us of any contentment we have found. They promise that if you are anything but meek, you can get a lot for yourself. It’s a deadly trap to fall into. The things our world promise sound great because of our discontent, but to chase after them only breeds more discontent.\n\nHowever, as those who find our identity in our Jesus, we can be content. We can rest in who we are in Christ. We see the power of meekness in the cross itself. \n\nWe are children of God. The redeemed. Those with a hope in the face of all tribulation. And the promise? We shall inherit the new heavens and the new earth.\n\nWritten By Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Nothing is more frustrating than a problem we cannot fix. I can think of about seven billion of these problems: people. We can’t fix people. Yet we try with blood, sweat, and tears. We try to solve their hearts and their sin and their pain. Sometimes we help. Often we are fruitless. Instead of a tidy resolution we are left with the residue and detritus sin leaves behind in all its acidity and stink.\n\nAnd none of this touches on the misery of trying to solve ourselves. Just as we cannot fix the sin of others, we cannot fix our own hearts either. Each day we wake up and realize we must live another day as the same person who went to bed the night before. And each day that person is just barely bearable. By distraction and grit, we make it. And then the next day we start again.\n\nLeft to itself, this reality would exhibit the laws of spiritual inertia—a decline to death, decay, and rot. Without an outside force good enough and powerful enough to solve these problems, they are condemnation. We are left with no hope, nothing but sadness. But we have such a force, and He spoke a few simple words a few thousand years ago to a few thousand people on the side of a mountain: “Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted” (Matthew 5:4). \n\nJesus was not offering trite promises of happiness. He wasn’t merely giving out hugs and smiles to make people forget their unsolvable sin (though I am sure He did not lack those for the needy). Neither was He setting up mourning as an aspiration—“blessed are those of you who can maintain a certain level of moroseness and misery”—as some Christians seem to believe. Jesus was offering hope to resolve the unresolvable. He was the hope.\n\nAll the way back in Isaiah, God promised One who would come to “heal the brokenhearted” and “comfort all who mourn” (Isaiah 61:1-2). Like us, the people then would have heard that as someone to rescue them from circumstances and make life all better. Jesus fulfilled Isaiah’s promise by doing both much more and much less. He did make life all better by crucifying sin and death. He did rescue us from the worst of our circumstances: our own sinfulness.\n\nBut Jesus did not fix our daily circumstances. Not yet at least. We still live in the pain of sin’s effect, but we know with certainty that our mourning will be comforted in full when Jesus comes again. Because our lives and hope and happiness depend on this comfort, our thanks run deep. We are thankful for the rescue that has already happened and for the one yet to come—the present comfort and the future comfort too.\n\nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

I have yet to meet a man who has escaped the dreaded experience of being short on change at one time or another. No one ever wants to endure the walk of shame away from the food you were so close to enjoying.\n\nThe part I hate the most about the times when this happens is how I instantly fall into the paranoia of thinking someone is judging me. I hear them in my head in a Jim Gaffigan whisper: “Oh, that’s so sad. He must be really poor. He can’t even cover a 99 cent burrito.” To silence the voices, I want to make up excuses about why I can’t get my food. I want people to know I do have money. If they knew that, I wouldn’t feel as bad about myself.\n\nThis situation reminds me of how all people come up short of righteousness. Romans 3:23 says that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” In a life apart from Christ, we are always many spiritual nickels short of the required price. Being dead in our sins and coming up short in our spiritual life, our temptation is to rummage through the moral change jar and other places that might prove we have enough to pay the price in full on our own. But we can’t. We need help.\n\nIt would be incredibly humbling to turn to the person next to you or the car behind you and ask for them to buy your food because you are short of what you need. But let’s say you do, and they cover you. You would be grateful, wouldn’t you? Acknowledging our spiritual poverty to God is vital to unleashing the immeasurable and unsearchable riches found in Christ.\n\nBeing needy may be frowned upon by our culture, but God not only welcomes it, He promises that our poverty of spirit will be met with the riches of His grace. Apart from Christ, the wrath of God remains on us as His enemies. But in Christ, God, being rich in mercy and great in love, offers Himself as our inheritance.\n\nWhen grace meets our poverty of spirit, it ignites the flames of gratitude for what God has done in and through Christ on our behalf. When our faith is in Christ, He not only removes our sin, but He also gives us His righteousness, which is credited to our account.\n\n“Oh, praise the One who paid my debt and raised this life up from the dead.” Those who are in Christ lack nothing. In Him, we never come up short. In Him we have everything we need.  \n\nWritten By Jevon Washington\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Christ-followers live with our feet in two worlds: this present world that we taste, see, and touch, and the world to come—the new heavens and the new earth, the eternal Kingdom of God. That second world is the one where our true citizenship lies. But that first world, this world, is the one where we are currently living out our days.\n\nIn this world, Jesus said, we will have trouble. But then He told us to take heart because He has overcome the world (John 16:33). We live in tension here, don’t we? We hold on to the hope of, as Tolkien put it, every sad thing coming untrue. But we still daily brush up against things like conflict, inadequacy, grief, poverty, lustful appetites, and (for some, anyway) persecution. One day, all of our struggles will become distant memories, if any memory of them is permitted to remain. But for now, we live in the tension.\n\nHow do we respond to this tension? How do we not cave in to the sorrows, conflicts, and stresses that so often seem to want a piece of us? One exercise we can always turn to for help is the prayerful practice of gratitude. When we take time to reflect upon and give thanks to God for the work of Christ, we set our minds on truths larger than the circumstances right in front of us. We ascribe the seat of power to its rightful King. We remember that the darkness can’t have us (Psalm 23).\n\nMeditating on gratitude is more than an exercise we can use to combat stress. It is a way to deliberately set our minds and hearts on what is true. The empty tomb proves that Jesus has, in fact, overcome the world. Because of this, we can confidently live with our hearts and minds trained on the world to come. Jesus wants this for His people. We need look no further than the Beatitudes to see that this is true.\n\nEarly in his Gospel, Matthew gives us the Sermon on the Mount—the single largest collection of Jesus’ teaching on how to live in this world in light of the life to come. The Beatitudes, which open that sermon, frame some of our deepest present struggles against the solution that will be ours in the coming Kingdom. The first four beatitudes focus on our relationship with God, and the last four deal with how we relate to one another.\n\nThe Beatitudes don’t simply describe our future hope. They define what Christ Himself embodied during His earthly ministry. Each beatitude makes a promise about the coming and certain peace and healing that belong to all who follow Christ. And every promise they contain is backed by the fact that Jesus perfectly embodied them. He was the meek One who inherited the earth, the One who hungered and thirsted for our righteousness and, by His resurrection, was satisfied. He was the Peacemaker we know as the Son of God. And when our faith is in Him, we are fellow heirs to His kingdom.\n\nThe promises of God are anchored in the finished work of Christ. All of them are. Rest in that. Give thanks for that. And may your time in this study be marked by a gratitude-saturated worship of Jesus, Who has overcome the world.\n\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

But it has a surprising and legendary German history, originally sung as a far rougher, more warlike battle hymn.\n\nLegend has it that the hymn originated in the 12th century as a Teutonic Knights’ anthem sung in Prussia under the Holy Roman Empire, or as an 18th century tune from the Germanic region of Silesia. Either way, the current tune carries the rousing moniker of “Crusader’s Hymn” (Brink 62).\n\nThis is due in part to Franz Liszt, prodigy pianist and world-renowned composer. He used this tune in his 1862 oratorio, “The Legend of St. Elizabeth,” as the battle march for his costumed crusaders. Suddenly, this quiet, lullaby of a song appeared in an entirely new light, all dressed up and armed for war.\n\nWith a closer look, we see this is true for many hymns and truths of the gospel as well. They can be sung gently and reassuringly, for we are God’s children, and we desperately need the comfort and beauty of this promise: “to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, gazing on the beauty of the Lord” (Psalm 27:4).\n\nBut the gospel is also a clarion call to the safety of our Lord in battle: “For He will conceal me in His shelter in the day of adversity; He will hide me under the cover of His tent; He will set me high on a rock” (Psalm 27:5-6). Thanks be to God, who preserves us and fights for us. And thanks be to Jesus, our Savior, the ruler of all nature.\n\nFairest Lord Jesus\nBy Joseph A.

Regardless, the gospel truths echoed in this hymn belong to all of us, those who are childlike in both stature and faith (Bailey 184).\n\nToday, this hymn remains a strong, timeless invitation and prayerful response to the imagery found in Psalm 23. While the psalmist affirms the Lord’s faithfulness and goodness, the hymn writer actively calls upon God out of personal need. When coupled together, the psalm and hymn serve as a call-and-response:\n\n“The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I lack” (v. 1).\nSavior, like a shepherd lead us, much we need Thy tender care.\n\n“He lets me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters” (v. 2).\nIn Thy pleasant pastures, feed us.\n\n“He renews my life; He leads me along the right paths for His name’s sake” (v. 3).\nFor our use Thy folds prepare:\nBlessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,\nThou hast bought us, Thine we are.\n\nOur endless call to our Shepherd is that of lost, needy, hungry children, and His response is love. We are His lambs—tender, wandering, forgetful—and yet He leads us still. He is our sure comfort and restful pasture. May we continually recall God’s character and call out for His faithful response.   \n\nThou hast loved us, love us still.\n\nSavior, Like a Shepherd Lead Us\nBy Dorothy A.

He said, “Music, with me has been a side issue… I would rather preach a gospel sermon to an appreciative audience than write a hymn. I have always looked upon myself as a preacher and felt a sort of depreciation when I began to be known more as a composer” (Butterworth 165).\n\nHis preference for preaching comes through in the way his most popular hymn plays like a sermon. The hymn utilizes a call-and-response pattern similar to that of Psalm 136, in which the leader of the assembly makes a statement about God, and the people respond, “His steadfast love endures forever.”\n\nThe lines of the hymn alternate—the odd lines asking essential questions about what reconciles us to God, while the even lines respond with the same refrain: “Nothing but the blood of Jesus.” The chorus, then, draws the musical sermon together, reminding us why the blood of Jesus is so necessary: “Precious is the flow that makes me white as snow. No other fount I know. Nothing but the blood of Jesus.”\n\nBy design, call-and-response hymns lead believers to confess their faith together. May we sing such songs over one another. And may “the message about the Messiah dwell richly among you, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, and singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, with gratitude in your hearts to God” (Colossians 3:16). \n\nNothing but the Blood\nBy Robert Lowry\n\nWhat can wash away my sin?\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\nWhat can make me whole again?\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nO precious is the flow\nthat makes me white as snow;\nno other fount I know;\nnothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nFor my pardon this I see:\nnothing but the blood of Jesus.\nFor my cleansing this my plea:\nnothing but the blood of Jesus. \n\nNothing can for sin atone:\nnothing but the blood of Jesus.\nNaught of good that I have done:\nnothing but the blood of Jesus. \n\nThis is all my hope and peace:\nnothing but the blood of Jesus.\nThis is all my righteousness:\nnothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\n                ",

He is immortalized in backyards everywhere as a stone lawn statue, usually cradling a bird or comforting a fawn. And there is truth behind the sculptures; Francis was actually very well known for his care and attention to animals. In fact, his enthusiasm for preaching the gospel and his love for animals occasionally drove him to go so far as to preach sermons to flocks of birds.\n\nIn 1226, with his vision failing and his life nearing its end, he wrote a poem titled “The Canticle of the Sun.” In his weakened state, he celebrated the psalmic call for all creation to praise God as Creator (Psalm 19).\n\nSaint Francis was always keen on unity with nature. In fact, in his original version of this hymn he referred to creation as family: brother sun, sister water, brother fire, mother earth, brother wind, and sister moon (Bailey 264). Although some English translations maintain those sentiments, when William Draper translated it from Latin to English in 1910 for a children’s festival, he paraphrased the original poem, leaving out references to any familial relationships with creation.\n\nWe can all join with creation to say, “Hallelujah!” and praise God for His creative goodness. We can sing with the psalmist in Psalm 148, praising God with the stars and the waters, the sea monsters, lightning, and clouds.

As he honed his preaching skills, he also practiced his skills as a poet. His prolific collection of poetry reflects on the depths of human sin and the heights of God’s inexpressible greatness (Bailey 456).\n\nSmith’s love for poetry emboldened him to explore his desire to know the unknowable. He used phrases like “light inaccessible hid from our eyes” in an attempt to describe the indescribable. Job used the same kind of paradoxical phrases to explain the reach of an eternal God, who “fixed the weight of the wind” (Job 28:25).\n\nThrough his struggle to express the inexpressible, Smith created a unique hymn. He invited his parishioners to join him in singing about the deep mystery of a God who is both intimate and ineffable.\n\nSmith’s forty-year journey to settle on lyrics for this one hymn is a profound testimony to the mystery of our immortal, invisible God. Even as we spend years of our lives meditating on His character, may we never cease to be awed by the Ancient of Days.\n\nImmortal, Invisible, God Only Wise\nBy Walter C.

From out in the dark waves they heard cries for help from a boy struggling to stay afloat. Her husband ran into the water to rescue him. But despite his efforts to bring the boy back to shore, both he and the child drowned.\n\nShocked, grieving, and penniless, Louisa and her daughter struggled in the years that followed. The tragedy of her husband’s death weighed heavily on her, both as a mourning wife and as the unexpected head of household. She didn’t have money for food, and their hungry days passed slowly, sustained by a quiet faith in God’s goodness in spite of their dire circumstances.\n\nOne day, Louisa heard a sound at the door. Upon opening it, she found a solitary parcel on her front doorstep. Not seeing anyone around, she looked inside and discovered a small gift of food and money (McKay 89). That same day she penned the words, “‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, just to take Him at His word.”\n\nLouisa’s life gives a powerful testament of simple yet mighty faith in Jesus. Her story reminds us that, even in the difficult times, God is surely our salvation. We can “trust and not be afraid” (Isaiah 12:2). Let us take Jesus at His word and believe that He will care for us.\n\n‘Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus\nBy Louisa Stead\n\n‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,\nand to take him at his word;\njust to rest upon his promise,\nand to know, “Thus saith the Lord.”\n\nJesus, Jesus, how I trust him!\nHow I’ve proved him o’er and o’er!\nJesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!\nO for grace to trust him more!\n\nO how sweet to trust in Jesus,\njust to trust his cleansing blood;\nand in simple faith to plunge me\nneath the healing, cleansing flood! \n\nYes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus,\njust from sin and self to cease;\njust from Jesus simply taking\nlife and rest, and joy and peace. \n\n                ",

A scraggly and rebellious teenager in Southampton, England, Watts was a poet who refused to sing psalms in church because they didn’t rhyme.\n\nWatts’ lyrical appreciation and incessant poetics were an annoyance to everyone around him, including his own preacher father, who threatened to whip his son if he continued his daily rhyming. The son replied, “O Father do some pity take, and I will no more verses make!” (McKay 67).\n\nAfter his anger subsided, Watts’ father challenged his writer son to create something “better” than King David’s psalms. At just 18 years old, Watts began writing hymns that were loosely rooted in the Psalms and aligned with his own singing preferences (which, of course, included rhyming). He aimed to communicate timeless gospel truths in contemporary language, as if King David was writing in the present-day 1700s (Watts 15).\n\nHis hymn “O God, Our Help In Ages Past” is based on Psalm 90:4:\n\nFor in Your sight a thousand years\nare like yesterday that passes by,\nlike a few hours of the night.\n\nWhen Watts’ signature style is applied to this passage, it becomes a singable hymn:\n\nA thousand ages in Thy sight\nAre like an evening gone;\nShort as the watch that ends the night\nBefore the rising sun.\n\nWhether sung in original psalmic context or modern rhyming prose, the importance of recalling God’s character remains the same.

From what we know of his life, “My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less” was just as much an anthem of his own testimony as it has become for believers all over the world.\n\nHaving grown up knowing nothing of God or His existence, Mote first attended church and became a Christian as a young adult. While still a new believer, he was compelled to try his hand at hymn writing. Thus, Mote wrote from a basic, yet profound understanding of his salvation.\n\nLater that same week, he visited a married couple at the wife’s sickbed. Without a hymnal handy to lead them in a song of worship, Mote produced a folded-up piece of paper upon which he had worked out four verses and a chorus. Together, they sang the hymn now known as “My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less” for the first time, blessed by the truths of God’s Word in the lyrics.   \n\nTwenty years later, as a Baptist minister, Mote was instrumental in securing a building for his congregation. As a show of thanks, the congregants offered to put the deed in his name, but Mote refused, saying, “I do not want the chapel. I only want the pulpit; and when I cease to preach Christ, then turn me out of that!” (Dough 72). Mote understood the profound simplicity of what remains secure and what will always be slipping away.\n\nChrist is the sole means of our salvation. Our hope is truly built on nothing less than Jesus.\n\nMy Hope Is Built On Nothing Less\nBy Edward Mote; William B. Bradbury\n\nMy hope is built on nothing less\nthan Jesus’ blood and righteousness;\nI dare not trust the sweetest frame,\nbut wholly lean on Jesus’ name.\n\nOn Christ, the solid rock, I stand;\nall other ground is sinking sand,\nall other ground is sinking sand.\n\nWhen darkness veils his lovely face,\nI rest on his unchanging grace;\nin every high and stormy gale,\nmy anchor holds within the veil. \n\nHis oath, his covenant, his blood\n\nsupport me in the whelming flood;\n\nwhen all around my soul gives way,\n\nhe then is all my hope and stay. \n\nWhen he shall come with trumpet sound,\nO may I then in him be found,\ndressed in his righteousness alone,\nfaultless to stand before the throne. \n\n ",

Music composition was his passion, but he didn’t have a piano in his tiny new abode.\n\nWhen a neighbor offered a dusty organ with cracked leather and stiffened stops for the price of five dollars, Haldor eagerly bought the wheezy organ and set about composing. As he settled into family life, he wrote many songs on that first, imperfect instrument.\n\nOne of the early compositions Haldor wrote on that five-dollar organ was “Wonderful Grace of Jesus,” which he, in turn, sold for five dollars (Brown 117). This small investment helped him write more songs, better songs—over 4,000 hymns in his lifetime—and he went on to found his own music publishing company.\n\n“Wonderful Grace of Jesus” is a triumphant song about the abundant grace of Christ (1 Timothy 1:14), one that is deeper than the sea and higher than the mountains.

So unspeakable, he would never disclose it; he would only say this: “Something happened to me, which was known only to myself, and which caused me the most severe mental suffering. The hymn was the fruit of that suffering” (Dough 111).\n\nThe hymn was “O Love That Will Not Let Me Go,” which famous American hymnwriter Fanny Crosby would affectionately call her favorite (112).\n\nCrosby and Matheson had something unique in common: they were both completely blind. Born with sight, Matheson’s eyes began failing over the course of his childhood, and he was fully blind by the age of eighteen. But that did not stop young George from pursuing what he loved. Coming from a wealthy merchant family in Glasgow, Matheson studied at the University of Glasgow and graduated with honors. He went on to become an influential pastor, leading a congregation of 2,000 members at St. Bernard’s Church in Edinburgh.\n\nBelievers from all over Scotland made the trek to St. Bernard’s to hear the blind preacher deliver his passionate messages from the pulpit, and congregants from all over the world sing his famous hymn to this day. Still, none but God and George himself will ever know what happened on that day in Innellan, as the man sat alone and furiously penned the words of this beloved hymn, the verses coming to him as if dictated by someone else. “It was the quickest work I ever did in my life,” he would later say. “I am quite sure the whole work was completed in five minutes” (111).\n\nThe Cross, the Joy, the Light, the Love—these were the truths that held tight to a Scottish pastor as he suffered through a pain he could not bear to name. They are the truths that hold us too.\n\nO Love That Will Not Let Me Go\nBy George Matheson; Albert L.

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Christianity was born in the Roman Empire. The book of Acts tells about how the message of Christ spread throughout the Roman world by way, not only of missionary journeys, but also by word of mouth from people whose lives had been transformed by the gospel.\n\nThe message of Christ spread quickly, and the number of those who believed grew to a size that caught Rome’s attention. Early on, the Roman Empire regarded Christianity as a sect of Judaism, which explains why Rome tended to treat conflicts between Jews and Christians in Acts as internal matters (Acts 18:12-17).\n\nEarly Christians did not oppose Roman authority. Jesus taught His followers to pay their taxes (Mark 12:17). Paul and the other apostles taught that Christians should honor the government so long as Roman authorities didn’t forbid them from following Christ (1 Tim. 2:1-2, 1 Pet. 2:17). Because of this, early Roman persecution of Christians was more the exception than the rule.\n\nThere were, however, a few notable tumultuous periods. For example, shortly after Jesus’ birth, Herod the Great, in his zeal to kill the one born “King of the Jews,” slaughtered all Hebrew male children under age two (Matt. 2:13-16). Later, in 64 AD, Emperor Nero blamed the great fire of Rome on Christians. It may have been during Nero’s persecution when both Paul and Peter lost their lives.\n\nChristianity spread throughout the Roman Empire and, according to Romans 15:28, a Christian church existed in the city of Rome itself as early as 50 AD—less than 20 years after the death and resurrection of Christ. It is fascinating to consider how the Roman occupation of Israel—something most Israelites viewed as an unfortunate hardship—would end up setting the table for the gospel to spread from Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria to the ends of the earth.\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Throughout the book of Acts, Israel was under Roman rule, which had been the case since Rome wrested the region from Syria in 64 BC. During the New Testament era, the Roman Empire ruled most of the known world.\n\nLegend tells us that Rome was founded by Romulus and Remus in 753 BC. The first seven kings of Rome increased the size of the kingdom by conquering neighboring territories. But eventually, a tyrannical king named Tarquinius Superbus drove the people to revolt. After this uprising, Rome became a republic which gave her citizens a voice in political and national affairs. As a republic, Rome grew even more powerful, reaching well beyond the borders of Italy into Africa, Asia, and Europe.\n\nAs anyone who has ever read Shakespeare knows, Roman leadership became increasingly unstable as the Empire grew larger. Ambition, paranoia, distrust, betrayal, and a lust for power made it very difficult for anyone to govern with stability for any length of time. Positions of authority in Rome had a high turnover rate due to assassinations, promotions, demotions, and transfers of power.\n\nBy the time Rome took occupation of Israel, the Empire was large, but spread thin. Israel’s location was strategic. It lay at the crossroads between Europe, Asia, and Africa. Ruling Israel meant Rome would be able to move freely between the continents.\n\nThe Jews were defined by their worship, their temple practices, and their history as followers of one God, and one God only—Jehovah. Rome knew that devotion like this was hard to extinguish, so they reckoned it would be politically wise to leverage Israel’s religious zeal as motivation to live at peace with their occupiers. Rome arranged a compromise. Israel could continue to practice their monotheistic religion so long as they obeyed Roman rule, paid their taxes, and kept the peace.\n\nThis was a shrewd psychological move. Under this arrangement, many in Israel came to see their right to worship God as a privilege that was now granted to them by Caesar, who could take it away if they fell out of line. We see this on display during the Triumphal Entry, when the Jewish religious leaders pleaded with Jesus to tell those laying down their palms and coats to stop referring to Him as a king. If Roman authorities heard this was happening, they might have shut down the Passover celebration (Luke 19:37-40).\n\nUnder Roman law, Jews were given certain rights that made the arrangement more palatable. For example, they were excused from military service and from ever having to appear in court on the Sabbath. By the time we come to the book of Acts, the dealings between Jews and Romans were predominantly positive.\n\n                ",

In that sense, the progression Jesus described is precisely what we see happen in the book of Acts as the gospel spreads from Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria to the ends of the Roman Empire. Since that time, the gospel has traveled around the globe many times over.\n\nIn terms of our present-day geography, here are some key places where the events of Acts took place:\n\nJerusalem: Roughly the same city as the one established during King David’s reign. As Israel’s capital city, Jerusalem is the heart of Jewish history and culture.\n\nJudea: The southern half of present day Israel—stretching from the Jordan River and Dead Sea west to the Mediterranean Sea, and from Gaza and the Red Sea north to Tel Aviv. It became a Roman province in 6 AD.\n\nSamaria: The northern half of present-day Israel, reaching from the Jordan River west to the Mediterranean Sea. Samaria was home to descendants of the Israelites who intermarried with their Babylonian captors during exile. These “Samaritans” were shunned by many traditional Jews.\n\nAsia Minor: The region of Paul’s 1st Missionary Journey—modern-day Turkey and Syria. Asia Minor included the regions of Phrygia, Pisidia, Galatia, Cappadocia, and Cilicia, and the cities of Derbe, Lystra, Ephesus, Colossae, Miletus, Philadelphia, and Antioch.\n\nMacedonia and Achaia: The regions of Paul’s 2nd and 3rd Missionary Journeys—modern-day Romania, Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Greece. The regions of Macedonia and Achaia included the cities of Thessalonica, Philippi, Berea, Athens, and Corinth.\n\nRome, Sicily, and Malta: The same as today. Sicily and Malta are the two islands just off the toe of Italy’s “boot.” Rome was the power center and heart of the vast Roman Empire.\n\n                ",

But the gospel of Jesus Christ unified those who were separated by culture, race, and social standing. For those living in first century Rome, this unity was not only beautiful, it was astonishing. Acts repeatedly calls this to our attention by identifying people not just by name, but by their people group, to show us how the gospel unifies them.\n\nHere is a brief overview of the key people groups named in Acts:\n\nJews / Hebrews / Israelites: Descendants of Abraham, and inheritors of God’s covenant. Devoted to the Law given to Moses at Mount Sinai (Genesis 17).\n\nGentiles: Literally, “the nations,” or everyone who was not Jewish. Romans, Greeks, and “barbarians” were regarded by most Israelites as “unclean” (Acts 10:45, 13:48, 14:4-7).\n\nGod-Fearers: Gentiles who worshipped Israel’s God but had not converted to Judaism, and did not adhere to the Jewish laws about food or circumcision (Acts 13:16, 13:26).\n\nRomans: Roman citizens protected by Roman law; had legal rights in the Roman Empire. Citizenship could be obtained by birth, and a ruling of law (Acts 22:25-29).\n\nGreeks: People born in Greece, or Greek-speaking people living in the eastern part of the Roman Empire (John 7:35).\n\n                ",

Read along with us as we set the stage with the people and places significant to the beginning of the early church. ‘Countdown to Acts’ is also available free on the He Reads Truth app.\n\nThe narrative arc of the Bible is told in essentially three movements:\n\n1.     The Old Testament: the story of our creation and fall, and of God’s promise to redeem His people.\n\n2.     The Gospels: the story of God’s promise fulfilled through Christ’s life, death, and resurrection.\n\n3.     The Book of Acts: the story of Jesus’ impact on the world as His followers took the gospel message to Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. (The only narrative portion of the New Testament not covered in Acts is John’s imprisonment and revelation on the island of Patmos.)\n\nThe book of Acts is not the end of God’s story, but rather the beginning of how the church found its way around the world and down through time to the places where we live and worship today.\n\nAuthor: Though the book of Acts specifies no author, earliest records attribute the book to Luke, who also wrote the Gospel bearing his name. Luke’s name appears three times in Paul’s prison letters (Col. 4:14; 2 Tim. 4:11; Phml. 1:24), indicating he was one of Paul’s traveling companions. Colossians 4:14 also identifies Luke as a doctor, which is supported by the way Luke uses specific medical language (e.g. Acts 28:8).\n\nDate: Both the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts are believed to have been written at the same time, during the early to mid 60s, likely during Paul’s imprisonment in Rome. The events in Acts take place after the death of Christ in AD 33 and conclude in AD 62.\n\nTheme: The book of Acts emphasizes the work of God through the Holy Spirit in the lives of people who devoted themselves to Jesus Christ—especially Paul, as he led the Gentile missionary endeavor. The Christian church was built, city by city, through the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit working through God’s chosen vessels.\n\n                ",

Because of God’s discipline.\n\nYears earlier, when the people in the desert complained to Moses that they wanted water, and feared that God had led them out into the wilderness to die, Moses chastised them for their rebellious hearts. Then he walked over to the rock the Lord had shown him, raised his staff and struck it in anger before their eyes.\n\nWater poured out, but Moses had sinned. He struck when only words were needed, and this act betrayed his anger not only toward the people, but also toward God (Numbers 20:1-13). The man that struck the rock wanted to strike God. God knew it. Moses knew it. \n\nGod’s discipline in Moses’ life was that he wouldn’t be the one to lead the people into the land. Moses—the one God called to lead the people out of Egypt, the one who led them across the dry ground that only moments earlier had been the Red Sea, the man who carried down from Mt. Sinai the Ten Commandments—would not see this journey to its end.\n\nHeartbreaking.\n\nBut when we read the end of Moses’ story, there’s more wonder and beauty in God’s discipline than there is sorrow. God took his servant up to survey the land so that Moses could see it with his own eyes. And then, with his wits about him and his vision clear, Moses died and God buried him, and no one ever found his grave (Deut 34:5-7).\n\nI love the mystery surrounding Moses’ death. I love how God laid his servant to rest in a secret place.\n\nBut I also love the affection and grace surrounding it. God wouldn’t let Moses enter the Promised Land. But this did not mean Moses would be left to languish east of the Jordan. In the act of forbidding Moses entry, God did His servant one better—He brought him home to glory in a private ceremony shared only between the two.\n\nThe discipline of God is never separated from His affection for us. Never.\n\n“No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields the fruit of peace and righteousness to those who have been trained by it” (Hebrews 12:11).\n\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

When I read this passage, I wonder how I have committed this same offense.\n\nHow often do we complain and grumble? How often are we impatient, as if God owes it to us to act on our timing? How often do we reject the words of His servants? How often do we reject His provision, and call it worthless food?\n\nThis final image of worthless food is particularly potent. Just this evening, as I set a fine dinner before my children, it was met with looks of disgust and complaint. This was the same recipe they had tasted many times before and had eaten with great relish, but this evening, I only heard grumbling.\n\nToo often, we act exactly as Israel did, and we do not awaken to our sin until the fiery serpents are on the loose. All through the wilderness, Moses constantly interceded for Israel, suing for mercy before the throne of God. In this way, he is a foreshadowing of Christ, who intercedes for us.\n\nYet here in Numbers 21, we see a clear picture of Christ Himself, offering forgiveness and life to a stubborn and impatient people. Galatians 3:13 says, “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree.’” So here, God calls Moses to direct Israel to Christ. The fiery serpents, sent as a curse against wicked Israel, are represented in bronze and lifted up, hung upon a tree.\n\nIt is this same image which Christ used to unfold the Gospel to Nicodemus: “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life” (John 3:14-15).\n\nNicodemus first came to Jesus at night, and like Israel, he came in spiritual darkness. Though he professed knowledge, he knew little. He stood guilty of rejecting the testimony of God (John 3:2,10-11). The message of Moses to Israel, and the message of Christ to Nicodemus, was the same: God so loves the world that He sends a rescuer, and if we but fix our eyes on Him in faith, we will live (John 3:16)!\n\nIsrael could not see the kingdom of God unless God Himself gave them the eyes of faith to see it (John 3:3). We, too, often fail to see God’s provision until He wakes us from our stupor. Christ, the Light that has come into the world, comes to us even in our darkness, and exposes our darkness for what it is (John 3:19-20).\n\nAs Moses lifted up the serpent, so Christ was lifted up for us. As Christ shows us His rich mercy, may we continually look to Him. Christ is our rich provision, our feast in the wilderness. He alone brings us healing and life.\n\nWritten By Caleb Faires \n\n                ",

He delivered God’s promises and commands to Israel, and he often pled with God to deal mercifully with Israel’s sins. Moses was God’s representative to Israel, and Moses was Israel’s representative to God.\n\nThe time Moses spent with God forged a deep intimacy with his Maker. We’re told he spoke to the Lord “face to face, as one man speaks to a friend” (Exodus 33:11). Not surprisingly, this closeness gave birth to a deep desire in Moses to see God in His fullness. So, in an intimate moment with God on Mount Sinai, Moses made  a bold request: “Please show me your glory” (Exodus 33:18).\n\nOut of love and protection for His servant, God refused to show Moses His face because no man can see God and live. The Lord did, however, grant Moses’ wish, to an extent, by showing him the hindquarters of His glory. As He did this, God gave Moses a mini sermon on His name, “The Lord” (Exodus 33:19-23).\n\nThis intimate moment with God “rubbed off” on Moses. After writing a second copy of the Ten Commandments, Moses descended from Mount Sinai with his face shining with the glory of God. The blazing presence of God’s glory changed Moses’ countenance.\n\nBut, it wouldn’t last long. The glory Moses received that day soon began to fade (2 Corinthians 3:13). This fading radiance was a sign that Moses had not yet obtained the true eternal weight of glory he was destined to receive (2 Corinthians 4:17). He would have to wait in faith for a greater revelation, which would lead to a greater reflection of glory.\n\nWe know this is true because centuries later the scene is reenacted. Jesus asks Peter, James, and John to join him on a mountain to pray (Matthew 17). As Jesus prays, He is transfigured before them as “His face begins to shine like the sun,” when suddenly Moses and Elijah appear with Him, also ablaze in the radiance of the glory of God.\n\nLong ago Moses saw the glory of God on Mount Sinai in the giving of the law. But on this day, Moses saw a much greater revelation of the glory of God on the Mount of Transfiguration—and he saw it in the face of the One who came to fulfill the law he gave. In a breathtaking twist, Moses, the lawgiver, sees the glory of Jesus, the law-fulfiller, who would die for us, the law-breakers, so that we might receive the same glory!\n\n“For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ” (John 1:17).\n\nEven now as we behold the glory of God by faith, staring into the loving face of Jesus Christ, we are changed into the glory we behold and love. We grow, Paul says, “from one degree of glory to another” (2 Corinthians 3:18).\n\nSo, stop. Stare. Keep your eyes fixed on Jesus. He is the light of the world (John 8:12).\n\nWritten By Nate Shurden \n\n                ",

One of the core practices they live and counsel by is something called “the traffic light principle.” In any significant decision they face, they individually ask for God’s direction then come together and compare answers: red (the answer is no), yellow (maybe, but not now), and green (yes, go for it). Simple, huh? But it would amaze you how powerful that can be.\n\nOf course the whole point of that discipline is to give God primacy in their lives. In other words, God goes first.\n\nTheir years of married highs and lows have shown them that when God doesn’t go before them, their relationship suffers. And by virtue of the fact that none of us live in a vacuum, they’ve seen their children and friends are also affected in not-so-good ways. They’ve learned, regardless of what it is, that it’s just not worth it if God is not first.\n\nMoses had the very same attitude when it came to leading the people, even going so far as to tell God, “If you don’t take the lead here, then call this off right now. It’s not worth it.”\n\nIn light of where Moses and the people were, that was an incredibly weighty statement. But Moses meant it, and God honored his honesty. In fact, what followed Moses’ conditional statement was an experience of a man seeing God’s glory like no man ever had before. His vulnerability led to a greater revelation, which at first hearing sounds almost like bumper sticker theology. But that’s what Scripture says happened.\n\nIf you don’t have some practice to give God first place in your life, consider some variation of the traffic light principle. It’s simple, so much so that anyone can understand it. And the weight of testimony, from the likes of Moses to the likes of our good married friends, indicates that it’s a wise idea to say, God, you must go first.\n\nIf God is not first, then regardless of what’s in front of you—even if it feels like freedom and looks like a land flowing with sweet milk and wild honey—it’s not worth it. It’s just not.  \n\nWritten By John Blase\n\n                ",

When a big decision looms, I gravitate toward the quickest decision which is (surprise, surprise) not always the best one. Impatience gets me in trouble. When I grasp at the solution at hand instead of seeking the best solution, it almost never goes well.\n\nThat’s what Israel did in Exodus 32. They tired of waiting on Moses and on God. They knew what was right, but it required patience and faith, so they discarded it. Instead of waiting for Moses to return from Sinai with God’s word, they demanded a new god made of gold.\n\nThis sounds absurd, doesn’t it? You can’t just manufacture a god. If it’s manufactured then it isn’t a deity. It’s just a decoration.\n\nAt the same time, though, we all do this when we choose to grasp at hope in something that isn’t God. Maybe it is money or employment or a relationship or status. Each of these are manufactured things, made up of created matter and created beings. They aren’t gods, yet we still turn to worship them and place our hopes in them—just like Israel did with the golden calf that Aaron made.\n\nWe forget something when we do this, something of utmost importance. We forget God —just like Israel forgot the God that thundered atop Sinai and wrote His commands on stone tablets. We forget God who freed us from our bondage to sin just like they forgot God who freed them from bondage to Egypt. Forgetting God has dire consequences.\n\nFor Israel, it led to the deaths of more than 3,000 people, followed by a plague that struck down even more. Is that vindictive of God, or too harsh? No. It’s a reminder of His holiness and how seriously this holy God takes idolatry. He is the only God to be worshipped.\n\nGod was setting aside a people for Himself, a people through whom He would bless the whole world. How could they be set apart as His if they gave themselves to a golden bovine? How can anyone who claims to be part of God’s people now be set apart if we worship anything other than Him?\n\nGod is holy—wholly other and perfect. There is no other. And that means we must be in or out, redeemed and committed to Him or facing judgment for our rebellion. We cannot pick our god. There is no menu off of which we order deities. Will we worship The Lord even when it means waiting and wondering? Because in this life, there will be waiting and wondering.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

And if you were at school you might pass a note. Guys were not allowed to pass notes to other guys, but girls could pass notes to anyone. And they would. And they would fold them very elaborately.\n\nThese notes were used for all kinds of purposes. Invites to parties. Gossip. But the primary use of these notes was to communicate with the person you “liked.”\n\nBut no one, I mean no one, ever passed notes to the person they liked without first using a mediator. A reliable go-between. You needed someone to deliver your words via the note and you needed them to be able to speak for you if needed. They also had to guard that note. You had to be able to trust that your declaration of affection would not fall into enemy hands and be trampled by swine.\n\nMy strategy for recruiting a reliable go-between was to choose a close friend of the lucky girl. And there were times where I exhausted that friend’s patience by asking her to go back and forth so she could report back to me where I stood. But undeterred, I persisted.\n\nBack and forth. Back and forth, till one day, success! The notes would be given directly to one another.\n\nWhat strikes me the most about Exodus 19 is all the going back and forth between the two parties. Moses goes up the mountain and talks to God, and then comes down to talk to the people, and then back up to talk to God, and then back down to deliver a message to the people. Moses probably got tired in his old age.\n\nDark clouds. God’s voice in the thunder. Touch this mountain and you will be killed.\n\nWhile the people were certainly thankful for their deliverance and freedom, and were willing to do whatever God asked of them, they had to have been a little afraid of this God they had heard about but had not really dealt with for hundreds of years. Thankfully, they had Moses who spoke for them and then spoke for God to them.\n\nThere are times when I have no idea how to deal with God. Life gets confusing. Decisions need to be made. I wonder how to move forward. And what I often do is try to strike a deal with God.\n\nI forget I do not have a mediator like Moses. I have Jesus. I do not have a mediator of Law. I have a Mediator who has fulfilled the law perfectly on my behalf. I do not have a mediator that will get exhausted with my requests but One who lives to intercede on my behalf.\n\nWhen life gets confusing, we can know that we can go to him through the person and work of Jesus—God himself—knowing we will hear from him “grace and truth.”\n\nWritten By Matthew B.

It often feels intrusive and even insulting, but maybe that’s a matter of attitude and perspective more than anything.\n\nIn Exodus 17 and 18 we find Moses in a tough spot. The weight of a nation seems to be sitting squarely on him and him alone. He upholds them in prayer during a key battle, raising arms to God. But when he tires and his arms droop, the Israelites begin to lose until two young men come to Moses’ aide and hold up his arms.\n\nA few verses later we see Moses dealing with disputes and judging the people all day long, from dawn until dusk. He is dealing with every squabble, every question, every everything. Moses is the spiritual leader and the legal authority. He is a one-man show.\n\nJust when he is at his breaking point, exhausted and stressed— oh goodie—the in-laws roll into town. But Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro, is a wise man and a religious leader himself. Consider how he approaches Moses.\n\nFirst, Jethro praises all that he sees God has done in Israel and he declares God’s greatness. This must have been a breath of fresh air to Moses and a reminder of God’s goodness. Instead of nitpicking or criticizing, Jethro encourages him.\n\nThen, building on that encouragement, Jethro offers some counsel. He sees how hard Moses is working to serve and lead the people, and he doesn’t criticize. Rather he says, “you will wear out yourself and your people” if you continue on like this.\n\nSo Jethro proposes a plan – select a number of trustworthy, godly men and appoint them as judges to handle the lesser disputes and questions on Moses’ behalf, so that Moses will be free to handle the significant disputes and actually lead instead of being bogged down in the details. \n\nWe can see some significant things about God’s design for Christian leadership in this story. Moses was a strong leader, appointed by God, but even he could not lead alone. He grew tired. He could not resolve every issue and carry every burden. Moses needed help. He needed to trust godly people to lead with him.\n\nMoses followed Jethro’s advice. He was humble enough to listen and to lean on others. That’s not an easy thing for people in authority to do.\n\nWhat made this easier was the manner in which Jethro came to him. He came praising and encouraging. Jethro did not criticize or tear down but rather proposed a plan to help. Few things are as encouraging to leaders as praise paired with good proposals.\n\nBoth Moses and Jethro exhibited great humility. Both showed a desire to honor God and care for the people—a leader’s truest responsibilities. These are key leadership traits because they’re foundational character traits. Do we exhibit them?  \n\nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    In Psalm 63, David declares:\n\n“O God, you are my God…\nMy soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you,\nas in a dry and weary land where there is no water.\nSo I have looked upon you in the sanctuary,\nbeholding your power and glory” (vv. 1-2).\n\nIn many ways, Moses himself might have used such words when facing the grumbling of the people of Israel. As they departed from the defeat of Egypt’s armies at the Red Sea and ventured into the wilderness, they almost immediately fell into hardship. It is tempting to discount their hardships as minor. But being without water in the wilderness is a serious matter.\n\nYet God had appointed Moses to lead them to this difficult place, this dry and thirsty land, where there was no water.\n\nThe sticking point was this: they saw only Moses. They saw him day in and day out, leading them deeper and deeper into difficulty, while water ran low, and meat was scarce, and their children were crying, and all of them were tired. And they tested God, saying, “Is the Lord among us, or not?” (Ex. 17:7).\n\nMoses, standing beside his brother Aaron, replied, “what are we? Your grumbling is not against us but against the Lord” (Ex 16:8).\n\nWe see a great contrast between Moses’ faithful response and Israel’s faithlessness. Again and again, the people turn to Moses and Aaron, grumbling. Again and again, Moses looks upon the sanctuary, interceding on Israel’s behalf. And again and again, God patiently provides. He turns bitter water sweet (Ex 15:25), leads them to a place of rich springs (Ex 15:27), rains bread from heaven and meat from the skies (Ex16:12-14), and even provides water from a rock (Ex. 17:6).\n\n“Now these things took place as examples for us that we might not desire evil as [Israel] did” (I Cor. 10:6).\n\nDid Israel desire evil? Didn’t they just want water? Indeed, they did desire water. They needed it. But they failed to look to God in His sanctuary, and instead, grumbled over their circumstances.\n\nHow like Israel we are? We need to hear the words of Moses, asking us, “why do you test the Lord” (Ex 17:2)? God often leads us into the wilderness to test us. He often guides us through the influence of others, who speak His words. But no matter how dire the need, or how weary we are in our wilderness, we are always called to look to the sanctuary of God, for Christ is “the bread that the Lord has given us to eat” (Ex. 16:15).\n\nPaul reminds us that we are just like Israel, for they “all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ” (I Cor. 10:3-4).\n\nLike them, despite our abundant wealth in Christ, we still tend to grumble. These examples remind us that we can never depend upon our own righteousness or faithfulness. “Therefore,” says Paul, “let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall” (I Cor 10:12).\n\nMay we heed these examples, turn our eyes toward the sanctuary, and fix our hope upon Christ our Rock. And as we turn to Him for all our needs, we can also rejoice that in Christ we rest secure, no matter how daunting the wilderness, “for He remember[s] His holy promise” (Ps. 105:42).\n\nWritten By Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

And you’d be right. Have I taught my children to do things on their own? Absolutely. But I’ve also taught them that calling out for help is not a weakness. In fact, when you need help often the bravest thing you can do is ask for it.\n\nI’m afraid we give our children incredibly mixed signals when we emphasize independence at the expense of dependence, especially in regard to the life of faith, where we’re supposed to be totally, well, dependent on God. Yes, sorta strange.\n\nSo much of the story of Moses is about attachment fathering—God training Moses and the Hebrew people to cry out to Him. Unfortunately this wasn’t a one-and-done lesson. It took years and years and more years; and even after all the miracles in Egypt and the plagues and the pillars of fire and cloud and the supernatural provisions in the middle of nowhere, some still doubted God was with them.\n\nBut God was as close as their breath, ready to respond to their pleas for help, to show to the watching world (at that time, Pharaoh’s army) that He was the good Father who fiercely loved His people and would do anything, anything at all, to make good on His promises to them.\n\nThere may not be a Red Sea in front of you, but chances are good there’s something out there, something that threatens to cause you to lose heart, maybe even give up. If Moses were here right now (which he sorta is via the living Word of God) I believe he’d say, Cry out to the good Father! Tell Him what’s going on, that you need help or you’re in trouble, or both. He will fight the battle for you, if you’ll let Him. Trust me, I’ve seen wonders like you would not believe. Why once, the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground! No god is great like God!\n\nWritten By John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The thunderous narrative of the final plague and the first Passover is unsettling. On the heels of repeated appeals to Pharaoh, and of nine horrific plagues, all of Egypt awoke at midnight with cries of grief. Moses, summoned in the middle of the night to the court of Pharaoh, finally heard the fulfillment of God’s promise. Pharaoh declared: “Go and serve the Lord, as you have said! And bless me also!” (Ex. 12:31-32).\n\nIn their sudden departure, what words passed between the Israelites? Between Moses and Aaron? As they ate their unleavened bread, remembered the blood on the doorposts, and packed up their things, God told them to remember this moment.\n\nAs the years went on and they commemorated their departure by reenacting that night, their children would ask, “What do you mean by this service?” And they would say “God declared it is the sacrifice of the Lord’s Passover, for He passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt, when He struck the Egyptians but spared our houses” (Ex. 12:26-27).\n\nMoses himself, in the midst of the Exodus, had been commissioned to do one thing: lead Israel to see the glory of God’s deliverance—to see the gospel. The signs and wonders, the terror of God’s judgment against sin, the undoing of Egypt’s idolatry, the sign of blood above the doorposts, the plundering of Egypt, and the hasty rush to freedom: these were all to be remembered and memorialized forever.\n\nIn the face of all this, the figure of Moses seems quite small. And that is exactly as it should be. God reminded Moses again and again that even as Moses faithfully delivered God’s words and warnings to Pharaoh, all things would come to pass by God’s own doing, in God’s own time, for God’s own glory.\n\nIndeed, the Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt” (Ex. 11:9). The fact that Moses’ words would seem fruitless before Pharaoh, time and again, was not reason for despair, but a reminder that God’s work of redemption is none of our doing.\n\nWhen God performs His works, it is always to show forth Christ’s preeminence. Even in that first Passover, long before the coming of Christ, we know that “by faith [Moses] kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood. Indeed, he considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward. By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible” (Heb. 11:28, 26-27).\n\nThe significance of the Exodus and the Passover are just as monumental for us as they were in the days of Moses. Like Moses, we are called fix our eyes not upon the kingdoms of this world nor upon the destroyer who comes in the night, but upon Christ Himself.\n\nGod is a deliverer. He “will not allow the destroyer to enter” (Ex. 12:23), but delivers His people out of bondage. We, like Moses, are called to celebrate this deliverance forever, for even as God “brought out Israel with silver and gold”, so He has led us forth in Christ, who is “greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt” (Ps. 105:37; Heb. 11:26).\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

And I certainly don’t want to upset any rabid Star Wars fans who may want to argue that stormtroopers don’t have parents. (I happily defer to the experts on such matters.) I’m just saying that since I was boy, I have wondered about those poor stormtroopers’ moms, and how sad they must have been when they got the news that their sons caught the business end of Han Solo’s blaster.\n\nMany of the stories in Scripture are complicated. The lines between the good guys and bad guys blur as we discover our heroes have flaws and our enemies have mothers.\n\nWhen we think about the ten plagues, it is important that we do so as human beings—as people who recognize that this whole episode in the story of God’s covenant promise to redeem and restore humanity to Himself is one filled with sorrow and complication. Crops, livestock, and firstborn sons’ lives were lost. Both the Hebrew and Egyptian people suffered great uncertainty and emotional pain.\n\nWe don’t give the account of the ten plagues the weight it deserves if we turn everyone into cartoon characters, with Moses and the Hebrews as smiling “good guys” and the Egyptians as one-note evil villains. These were people—all of them.\n\nSo what do we do with the struggle? What are these plagues about? \n\nThey are about God’s right to rule over His creation. The King of Egypt had come to think of himself as a God, and he had also come to regard the Hebrew people as his property. This was as lethal an arrangement for Egypt as is was for Israel because, as Exodus 10 tells us, Egypt was ruled by a king whose heart was hard.\n\nGod’s aim in delivering the Israelites wasn’t just for their benefit. It was a grace for everyone because God had promised to make Israel a blessing to all nations. The Hebrews were to become a nation who would honor the complicated nature of humanity by offering hope instead of condemnation, kindness instead of tyranny, and freedom instead of slavery.\n\nBut as we read on, the story only gets more complicated. Israel struggles and fails to live up to their design. Their own kings’ hearts were often just as hard at Pharaoh’s. Israel didn’t just need God to prevail over the hardness of Pharaoh’s heart. God had to deal with their own kings’ hardened hearts too. In fact, every one of us needs this same remedy.\n\nThat mercy—God prevailing over our hardened hearts—goes beyond plagues, wars, and exiles. It goes all the way to a cross outside of Jerusalem, where heroes with flaws and soldiers with mothers watched the God of all creation purchase the freedom of those who would believe through the death of a firstborn son.\n\nThe gravity and complexity of stories like the ten plagues or the crucifixion of Christ remind us just how desperate we are, and how authoritatively God prevails over even the hardest of hearts—mine included.\n\nWritten By Russ Ramsey \n\n                ",

I decided I’d allow him to be Moses and I’d be Moses’ brother Aaron, picking his arms up and padding along behind him.” – June Carter Cash\n\nA few days ago I finished a biography of Johnny Cash.\n\nMost people are not aware of his dramatic story. He was at ground zero of the start of rock and roll with Elvis in the 50s and 60s. But then came the 70s and 80s. He had a few hits but mostly he was resigned to nostalgia. He was addicted to pills, struggled to be a good dad to his kids, and was aimless in his career.\n\nAnd he couldn’t sell records.\n\nWhat most people don’t know about Johnny Cash is there was one thing that never changed. His addictions waxed and waned. He failed repeatedly. He was weak physically and spiritually. But his belief that he was called by God to sing about His power to deliver people from their sin never changed, even when he was at his lowest.\n\nBy the time the 90s rolled around, Cash was growing old, and that calling had to seem like it was becoming increasingly impossible. He was irrelevant and powerless.\n\nMoses has been given what must have seemed an impossible task. In Exodus 4, God told him to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go. He was also told that God would harden Pharaoh’s heart, making Moses’ job all the more difficult. And then when he set about doing it, we read in Exodus 5 that Pharaoh punished those whom Moses came to rescue.\n\nMoses had to feel powerless, which was why he accused God of evil.\n\nGod’s response? “Remember who I am. I’ll keep my covenant with my people and set them free. They will no longer be captives. Tell them this” (Exodus 6:6-8, my paraphrase).\n\nIn the face of so many reasons to doubt, God promises that He will deliver Israel. It was hard to believe.\n\nMaybe you can relate. All around you is difficulty and failure. You look at yourself and see your weakness, your sin, and your circumstances, and you cannot imagine God is keeping His promises. You feel like a captive and it is hard to believe you have anything resembling freedom.\n\nIn the 90s, Cash found redemption as an artist through the popular American Recordings series, produced by Rick Rubin. On that first album, he sings a song he wrote called “Redemption:”\n\nAnd the blood gave life\nTo the branches of the tree\nAnd the blood was the price\nThat set the captives free\n\nCash didn’t just enjoy redemption as an artist but as a man who had a lot of reasons to doubt God’s promises. But he wrote that song because he knew the surety of those promises is the shed blood of Christ on his behalf. On our behalf.\n\nIt’s so easy to look at our failures and sins and then doubt. But when we look to Jesus and what He did for us on the cross, we are reminded of God’s promise. We have been freed and one day will enjoy that freedom to the full.\n\nWritten By Matthew B.

Begin working on increasing your platform immediately. It is true that the people will not believe you now, but if you can double your Twitter following and increase the reach of your Instagram account, then the people will respect you as a leader. If you can angle your way into a better job with a more important title, then my people will hear your voice and respond. If you can make just a little more money, or be seen as the most powerful man in the room, then the people of Israel will follow you. If you buy better clothes and wear nicer shoes, then my people will know you are called to be their leader.”\n\nThis is a paraphrase not so much of the Bible, but of the human heart. \n\nSometimes if feels more natural to seek leadership and influence not by the power of God, but by our own strength and will. Clearly, God would never say something like this; but I think the desire to make our own name great runs deep. It can trick us into thinking that the pursuit of glory in the name of God is the same thing as glorifying God. It can also trick us into becoming much more comfortable with relying on our talents and strengths than on the supernatural power of God.\n\nOne of my favorite professors in seminary always challenged us to search our hearts and think clearly about our motives and methods for approaching leadership positions. His basic premise was this: if you feel like you’ve smooth-talked or influenced (or platform-ed) your way into a position of leadership, then it’s hard to know if you weaseled your way into power or if God has actually called you to that place. Working your way to leadership through your own strength could actually pay off in the short run, but when the going gets tough, it’s highly likely that you’ll waver.\n\nThe best positions of leadership are the ones you know you couldn’t have attained without the intervention of the Most High. \n\nMoses was in such a place. There was no way that he could have confronted Pharaoh and triumphed because of his bravado. There was no way the Israelites would’ve have followed him on account of his clever speeches or military prowess. The only way Moses could account for progress was by the hand of God.\n\nIt was the same for Aaron! “No one takes this honor for himself, but only when called by God, just as Aaron was” (Hebrews 5.4).\n\nMoses succeeded because he knew that it was really God who was paving the way for change and redemption. The signs of the staff and the leprous hand were proof not just to Pharaoh’s court, but also to Moses, that God was doing this work.\n\nWe can’t force God’s hand. We can only follow His lead. With that in mind, we should examine our own hearts and motivations. A good thing done for the wrong reasons or in the wrong way can have disastrous results. How are you caring for your family? Your co-workers? Your friends? Are you operating out of a place of self-contrived power? Or do you seek divinely given influence?\n\nMan may be impressed by the outward appearance, but remember—God looks at the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).\n\nWritten By Andrew Stoddard \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    There was an older gentleman in my hometown that took me under his wing when I was in middle school. He gave me my first motorcycle ride, taught me the importance of a firm handshake, and explained how to smooth talk your way out of a tight spot.\n\nOne summer he hired me to work for him and dubbed me his “official representative.” It wasn’t as fancy as it sounds. My work usually consisted of trips to the hardware store for more nails and calling customers to tell them their order was ready (or not). I was essentially a glorified errand boy.\n\nWhenever I was acting on his behalf, he’d always say, “Remember, if anyone gives you trouble, tell ‘em Larry sent you.” Larry knew that no one would listen to me, and so when I spoke, he wanted everyone to know they weren’t listening to me—they were listening to Larry through me. That made all the difference.\n\nWhen angel of the Lord appeared to Moses in the burning bush, something very similar was happening—only far more important. In fear for his life, Moses fled to Midian from his home in Egypt after killing an Egyptian taskmaster. He made a nice life for himself there. He married and settled down, and soon Egypt became a distant memory.\n\nBut then, after years of living the inconspicuous life of a shepherd, Moses was thrust into the very center stage of redemptive history.\n\nTrembling, he slipped off his sandals and rested his bare feet on the holy ground as God introduced Himself. Moses could hardly believe his ears when God called him to lead Israel out of Egypt to the Promised Land. Feeling completely unqualified for the job, Moses questioned God. Why me? What am I to say? Who am I to say sent me? \n\nPatiently, God responded, “Just tell them ‘I am’ sent you” (Exodus 3:14).\n\nThe truth is, God knew Moses wasn’t qualified for the job. He also knew that Pharaoh wouldn’t listen to the voice of Moses. But that’s okay, because Moses wasn’t acting on his own behalf. God was speaking and acting through Moses, and in the end, that made all the difference.\n\nWe may not be hearing God’s voice from the midst of a burning bush, or leading a nation of captives to freedom, but each day we live and move as representatives of God in the world. It is an act of faith to do what the Lord has called us to do without relying upon human confidence and credentials, but to instead remember that your life is hidden with Christ in God (Colossians 3:3).\n\nLet His strength be perfected in your weakness today (2 Corinthians 12:9). In the name of the Lord, answer God’s call on your life, and as you do, trust God to do the heavy lifting. That’s what He did for Moses. He will for you, too.\n\nWritten By Nate Shurden \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    A wise friend of mine once told me, “Beware the man who makes himself the hero of his own story.”\n\nThroughout this study on the life of Moses, we are going read about a man who bears all the marks of a hero. He leads an entire nation of people out from under the grip of one of the most powerful rulers in the world. He stands before the mighty Pharaoh and warns the king of Egypt that if he doesn’t let the Israelites go, he’ll reap a world of hurt. And those words prove not to be empty.\n\nFrogs fall from the sky and the Nile River turns to blood. Locusts consume Egypt’s crops and a plague kills her livestock. Moses raises his hands and the Red Sea parts, giving an otherwise trapped nation of refugees a path to freedom. He strikes a rock in the desert and enough water to quench the entire nation’s thirst comes rushing out. He ascends a mountain and meets with the God of all creation. Then he comes down from that meeting bearing two tablets of stone written in God’s own hand—a Holy Law to govern them all.\n\nAs all this happens, we may be inclined to cheer for Moses, our brave-hearted gladiator whose weapon is the power of God and whose shield is the Lord’s divine protection. But if we make Moses our hero, we have misplaced our hope. As admirable, inspirational, and fascinating as Moses is (and he certainly is all these things and more), he is not the hero of his own story. God is.\n\nWe only need to look at Moses’ failures—his anger at God (Exodus 5:22-23), his occasional disdain for his own people (Exodus 17:1-7), his murderous heart (Exodus 2:11-12), and his reluctance to lead (Exodus 4:10-17)—to see that he is, at best, a deeply flawed hero. \n\nBut it isn’t even Moses’ character flaws that show us he isn’t the hero of the story. It is the providential way Moses came to find himself in this position in the first place. The Lord, making good on a promise He made to Abraham 400 years earlier (Genesis 15:13), spared Moses’ life from Egypt’s brutal campaign to exterminate all male Hebrew children under two (Exodus 1:22). Moses’ mother floated him down the currents of the Nile but the Lord guided the baby in the basket straight into the heart of Pharaoh’s own daughter, who raised the slave as her prince.\n\nGod is the architect of this story, which means He is the true hero. This is good news for us. It reminds us that God is in the business of using flawed, fearful people as agents of redemption in this world—limits, imperfections, and all. As we dig into the fascinating life of Moses, look for the providence and power of God on display throughout, and remember that this same wisdom and strength is at work in our lives today.\n\nYou do not have to be the hero of your own story. You have a Hero. This study tells His story.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

Just the two of us in his hospital room.\n\nBack in 2001, he had his first heart attack. And first surgery. And during the surgery, he had his first stroke. That was the first time I sat and talked with him while he lay in a hospital bed. Over the next twelve years, he would have more heart attacks and more strokes. Our once athletic Dad—a minister of the gospel who was a genius on the tennis court and could throw a curve in slow pitch softball (I swear it would curve like Koufax)—seemed to wither away before us.\n\nNow, after so many hospital visits, there we were again. He knew this would be his last hospital bed. We all knew it. He was dying. He was virtually blind. He could barely walk. And his memory was terrible.\n\nHe looked over at me and said, “I’m ready to go.”\n\nHe went on to tell me he was tired, and he knew where he was going and Who he was going to. I thanked him for being a great Dad and a good friend. And then we sat there in that heavy moment and he asked me how my fantasy baseball team was doing.\n\n“What?”\n\n“How is your fantasy baseball team doing?”\n\n“Ummmm, Dad, I’ve kinda not been paying attention since you’ve been in here.”\n\nAnd then he asked, “Do you think there is baseball in heaven?”\n\nI told him I was sure the most perfect game would be in the most perfect place. And then I told him the green and the brown would be so beautiful it would make us weep. He would have the vision to see it, too, because Paul says we would all be changed. And he would be able to play like he did as a kid, without ever getting tired. It would always be that perfect June dusk with just a little bit of warmth in the air. And there would be no injuries and only the joy of the game when the bat hits the ball and ball hits the glove.\n\nHe stared at the ceiling and we both were teary-eyed by the time I was done. “I think you’re right. I’m ready to go.”\n\nWhat will heaven be like?\n\nPaul tells us in his first letter to the church at Corinth, “We shall all be changed” (1 Cor. 15:51). He actually says it twice. Changed for the better, we will put on “the imperishable” (1 Cor 15:54). No more hospital beds. No more funerals. Think of it: no more death. Death will be defeated. And I would assume no injuries on the ball field.\n\nAnd Jesus tells us in the book of Revelation, “Behold, I am making all things new” (Rev 21:5). What has been wearing away because of death and sin will shine like it was supposed to. All that was broken will be made new.\n\nAll. All will be made new. Just off the line. The rust erased. The missing pieces replaced.\n\nI’m ready to go, too.\n\nWritten By Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Take me to the most glorious place on earth and I can promise you this: at some point I will long to go back home.\n\nOne of the realities we celebrate when we think about the implications of Jesus’ resurrection is how all things will be made new. In Scripture, we read about how there will be a new heavens and a new earth, and how we will have glorified bodies.\n\nPerhaps you’ve wondered, as I have, if this means that in the life to come we’ll have the wisdom of the aged, bodies of 21 year olds, the metabolism of 12 year olds, and the energy of children. It can be fun to try to imagine what our eternal destiny as the children of God will be like—the geography, the city of God, our glorified bodies, and the sweetness of a “New Earth” sun-ripened peach.\n\nBut we make a mistake if we think of our eternal destiny like a vacation at the beach rather than our home.\n\nA number of years ago, my parents moved from the Midwest to an island on the Atlantic coast. At least once a year my wife and I load the kids into the car and drive out for a week with my folks on the beach—a glorious, relaxing, and funky-smelling magical land of sunburned noses, fresh seafood, playful dolphins, and moonlit beach walks.\n\nBut guess what happens after we’ve been there for a while? We start to feel a hunger for home. For all the beauty, fun, and relaxation the beach has to offer, the place itself cannot capture our hearts the way home has. Why is this? Because home isn’t just where we keep our things. It is where we experience life. Our friends are there. Our work. Our church. And so also our struggles. Our worries. Our routines.\n\nHome is where we belong. Home is where we see the flaws in our friends and the cracks in our city’s foundation. It is where we wound each other and then consider whether or not to circle back and pursue healing. This side of glory, home is the place where people most clearly see what Paul describes as my corruption, dishonor, and weakness (1 Cor. 15:42-43). In other words, my home is where people most clearly see me as I really am.\n\nBut today’s passages remind us that just as heaven and earth will be made new, so will we be made new. This is our eternal destiny. The life to come will not be an extended vacation in a place that is not our home. We will belong in a way unlike anything we have ever known.\n\nThis is one of the most glorious implications of the resurrection of Jesus: we whose lives are joined to Him in His death and resurrection will ourselves be changed—in such a way that we will be a perfect match for all the glory the new heavens and new earth call for.\n\nJust as heaven and earth will be made new—so will we. Not just our bodies, but our hearts and perspectives too. If our faith is in Christ, this is our eternal destiny. We will not be tourists in God’s eternal glory—but residents. We will be home.\n\nWritten By Russ Ramsey \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    “Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.” – Andy Dufresne, The Shawshank Redemption\n\nNo matter what we do or how we eat and exercise, death draws closer, though we’re never sure how close it actually is. We look around and see suffering and injustice. We experience them ourselves. Things can look mighty bleak. In our honest moments we acknowledge that we are weak and life is short. As Scripture tells us, we are “jars of clay” – temporal, brittle, disposable, and decomposing.\n\nIt’s what we carry in these fragile vessels that really matters. The trouble of this world overwhelms us from the outside, but what treasure do we hold inside?\n\nAndy Dufresne was on to something. Hope is a good thing, especially hope that’s based in the right things. Hope gives us a reason to press on. What followers of Jesus hold in these jars of clay is the hope of the resurrection, the hope of eternal life with Christ.\n\nNo trouble in this life can overcome the hope and reality of resurrection. How can we know this? Because the worst thing that can happen in life is death. And what is resurrection but the death of death?\n\nIf this seems far-fetched, too unrealistic, out beyond the theological or theoretical reaches of ideas, then think of the basics of the gospel we believe. “If there is no resurrection of the dead then Christ has not been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without foundation, and so is your faith” (1 Cor. 15:13-14). Without resurrection there is no savior, and without a savior there is no hope. So we absolutely and completely place our hope in the resurrection and in the knowledge that Christ’s resurrection defeated death, so that we too can live after dying.\n\nBut what does all this mean for today? What does it mean for the troubles we face now?\n\nIt means “we do not give up,” no matter what pain we face, what persecution, what injustice, what illness, what malice, what aging, what loss. “Even though the outer person is being destroyed, our inner person is being renewed day by day. For our momentary light affliction is producing for us an absolutely incomparable eternal weight of glory” (2 Cor. 4:17).\n\nOur pain, our mortality, and our suffering are not light and momentary in themselves, but compared to the eternal joy of resurrected life with Jesus, they are. We still hurt, but we base our hope in the best of things—death’s defeat and eternal life with Christ. This hope can carry us through anything.\n\nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    For some of us, anticipation of future wholeness and newness of life comes naturally. When we observe the painful, broken, and difficult lives of those around us (including our own), we feel the longing for future glory and healing. I feel it a dozen times a day, and I’m sure many of you do as well. It’s the knowledge that things are not as they should be. It’s the very real feeling that on a personal and global level, all is not ultimately well.\n\nThese rumblings and grumblings ultimately point us to God and towards eternity. In light of suffering and struggle, the past resurrection of Jesus and the promised future resurrection of the saints make sense. Jesus has done the work, and we thank God that down the road we will eventually reap the reward. We celebrate the past even as we long for the future.\n\nBut what about the present? What about now? How do we participate in the resurrection now?\n\nThis is not really a question of process, but of identity. How we participate is answered by who we are presently in Christ. Paul reminds both the church in Corinth and the church in Rome of their new life and personhood in Jesus. The Christian walk is a participation in death and resurrection on a daily basis.\n\nEach flickering light of dawn presents to us the hope of newness of life in that day. We live in the tension of the “already” and the “not yet.” We are already redeemed, but not yet fully sanctified. We are already dead to sin in Christ, but we are not yet completely disentangled from sin in our daily lives. We are already being restored to new life, but we still wait to be restored in our eternal bodies.\n\nPerhaps this is why we gravitate to the past and then pivot our gaze so quickly to the future. The present is chaotic and messy. It’s a cycle of dying to sin and dying to self and choosing to step into new life multiple times within any given day. Our present situation can either be cause for discouragement or hope. If we focus too deeply on either the past or future, we miss out on developing as people of the resurrection in the here and now.\n\nPaul’s address to the Roman believers in Romans 6 assumes that they are still working to separate themselves from a life of sin. He encourages them to avoid cheapening the grace of God by sinning recklessly and thoughtlessly, but he also speaks the truth of the gospel-centered life over them: we should no longer be slaves to sin (Romans 6:6).\n\nOur eternal transformation is intimately connected with our new identity in Christ. We have future hope because, in the past, Jesus physically rose from the dead. The present is rough, but resurrection people can take heart in the mess. We are already transformed with a power beyond our wildest dreams, even if we are still waiting for that transformation to become complete. \n\nSuch is the present. Thank God that the resurrection of Jesus is the defining event of our “now.”\n\nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I’ve always loved worshipping at churches in which the congregants hold out their hands, at the end of the service, to symbolize their expectant reception of the blessing of God when the minister lifts his hands to pronounce the benediction. I suppose I first came to love this aspect of worship when I realized that it was the last thing Jesus did during His earthly ministry.\n\nAs He ascended to heaven, Jesus lifted up His hands and pronounced a blessing over His disciples. How fitting that this was His last act on earth since Jesus ascended to heaven as our great High Priest, in order to continue the work of redemption on our behalf in the presence of God.\n\nThe ascension is one of the most wonderful and yet overlooked acts of God in redemptive history. It not only teaches us that “the body of Jesus has a zip code,” as Derek Thomas has so illustratively captured it; it reminds us that we have a Savior who is continuing His work on our behalf, as our Priest, having already offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the forgiveness of our sins.\n\nIn the Old Testament, the priest carried the sacrifice into the most holy place in the Temple while he also carried the names of God’s people into the presence of God on his breastplate. His work as the people’s representative was to sacrifice and intercede for them.\n\nThis is a divinely inspired picture of what we all need. We are sinners and, as such, need a Priest to represent us before the presence of our infinitely holy God. Jesus Christ is that priest. All of the blessings of God have been secured for us by His perfect life and atoning death, making His ascension and continual intercession for us a constant source of confidence in His grace.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews calls the hope that we have on account of Jesus’s ascension “an anchor for the soul” (Heb. 6:19). We are anchored in glory because Christ has ascended to the Father.\n\nWhen we see the enormity of our sin and feel the doubts rising in our hearts, we must look, by faith, at the nail-pierced hands of Jesus. Jesus has lifted up His hands as symbols of His redeeming work, even as He was lifted up to glory, to pronounce the eternal blessings of God on those for whom His hands were pierced.\n\nWritten By Nick Batzig \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I have been drawn to Simon Peter since the first time I read the Gospels back when I was a teenager. The reason I like him so much is because 1) he is presented to us as Jesus’ friend, 2) he regularly fails at being a good friend, and 3) Jesus’ love for him never falters. That Jesus would love a walking contradiction like Simon Peter bodes well for you and me.\n\nThe story of Peter jumping out of the boat comes on the heels of a pretty spectacular failure. Peter has returned to his home and his former trade—fishing. Only days earlier, in Jesus’ greatest hour of need, Peter denied knowing Him. Perhaps the most painful part was that he did it just as Jesus predicted—before the rooster crowed. When that rooster crowed, something undeniably true came from the deepest recesses of this man. Peter realized he was tested and had failed. This collapse called into question the past three years he had invested as Jesus’ disciple. Of course it did.\n\nAfter Peter made his denial, Jesus went on to die. This forced Peter to question what the rest of his life was going to look like. When we discover that the durability of our faith is not what we thought it was, we come face to face with the truth that we are all walking contradictions.\n\nBut when Peter recognized Jesus standing on the shore, he threw himself into the water so he could swim, fully clothed, to shore and collapse at the feet of his best friend, whom he had betrayed. If we come to Jesus at all, we come in this way: desperate at the feet of the One we deny.\n\nWhat did Jesus do for the sad and sopping disciple? John tells us He made him breakfast. What wondrous love is this? Since the dawn of time, one man making breakfast over a campfire for another has been a universal way to say, “You and I are friends.”\n\nAs Peter stood before his Lord, Jesus asked the most revealing and volatile question He could: “Peter, do you love me?”\n\nPeter swallowed hard and said, “Yes Lord. You know that I love you.”\n\nJesus said, “Then feed my sheep.”\n\nThree times Jesus asked this. He never questioned Peter’s response, as if He doubted him. But each time Peter confessed his love, Jesus told him, “Take care of my flock.”\n\nWhat is Jesus doing here? Why did He ask this so many times? One reason was so that Peter would have to hear himself confess the unvarnished truth: “Lord, you know that I love you. I love you and I’ve failed you. But I love you.” Here is the paradox for every disciple who has ever walked the face of the earth. We love Jesus, and we fail Jesus. Yet we love Jesus. Really, we do.\n\nIt is so important that we come to see ourselves like this. In effect, Jesus is saying to His disciple, and by extension all who follow Him, “Peter, I don’t need your righteousness. You need mine. And I have given it to you—even now.”\n\nIf a disciple as close to Jesus as Peter can fail as epically as he did and still find himself firmly in the grip of the love of Christ, then you and I—when we doubt or when we struggle or when we fear or even when we fail—will not be separated from His love either. \n\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

We’ve likely said them ourselves. Phrases like these indicate skepticism. They express our doubts about a situation.\n\nHere’s another phrase we’re likely familiar with: “doubting Thomas.” That’s someone who says those first three phrases all the time. He is a perpetual questioner, hard to convince and win over, needing incontrovertible proof before agreeing or believing.\n\nThat’s being awfully hard on the original Thomas, though. In John 20, Jesus appears to the disciples after His resurrection, but Thomas was not with them. Put yourself in Thomas’s shoes. You get back from running some errands or visiting family, and when you meet up with your friends again, what you hear is unbelievable. Literally, unbelievable. They insist that Jesus—the one you staked all your hope on, the one you saw die a criminal’s death—is alive. Who could believe that? Dead people do not come back to life. That is what the word “dead” means.\n\nBut your friends insist. You know they’re not insane and you can tell they aren’t pulling your leg. But dead is dead. Neither, though, can you just discount their sincerity. You say, “I’ll believe it when I see it.” You don’t believe, but you leave the door open in case the impossible happens.\n\nThat’s what Thomas did. Is that doubting? Yes, but it seems reasonable to me. After all, Jesus died and was buried in a tomb hewn of stone. And they were all witnesses to this fact.\n\nWhat Jesus does next is beautiful; it’s exactly what Thomas needs in order to believe. Thomas said he would believe only if he could touch the scars in Jesus’ hands and side, so Jesus appears and shows Thomas the wounds. Jesus shows patience, grace, and understanding by giving Thomas what he needs to believe.\n\nAnd Thomas does believe. He doesn’t cling to his skepticism or let pride get in the way. He doesn’t take time to come around. Immediately, Thomas responded with, “My Lord and my God!” That’s worship—the kind a risen Jesus deserves.\n\nThis passage closes with an exhortation from Jesus Himself, one that all of us who are doubters and questioners must cling to. Jesus says, “Those who believe without seeing are blessed” (v. 29). He isn’t calling us to blind, ignorant faith the way so many skeptics see it. He is calling us to trust His Word and promises. \n\nThomas had heard Jesus talk about dying and rising many times, yet still he doubted. We often do the same, but we would be happier and closer to Jesus if we took His Word to heart and simply believed.\n\nRemember, He already proved His promises in His resurrection. What more do we need?\n\nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

I then asked him what he did for a living, and he told me he was the Attorney General for the State of Oklahoma.\n\nAha. Okay. So much for being aware of my own important state officials!\n\nIn Luke 24:13-35, followers of Jesus were walking back from Jerusalem. They’d just witnessed the Messiah’s death by crucifixion. Their hopes and dreams had been dashed. Nothing was what they had expected it to be. It was a profoundly disappointing journey.\n\nPerhaps you can relate. Your dreams didn’t turn out either. Your career isn’t going as you had hoped. Your marriage isn’t what you wanted, or else you want to be married and aren’t. You have a deep rage or shame or unease in your life.

Jesus was there with these disciples on this lonely, sad road. They weren’t alone. He was with them. He explained to them all about what He was doing and how He was working all throughout time and even then. Even now He is working.\n\nWe read, “Their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him. And He vanished from their sight. They said to each other, ‘Did not our hearts burn within us while He talked to us on the road, while He opened to us the Scriptures’” (Luke 24:31-32)?\n\nThat made all the difference. Jesus opened their eyes so they could see Him, to know He had been with them and to understand what He had been doing, teaching, showing, and saying to them. \n\nTheir response? “They rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, saying, ‘The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!’ Then they told what had happened on the road, and how He was known to them in the breaking of the bread” (Luke 24:33-35).\n\nThey rejoiced to know the Lord, and they couldn’t help but tell others about what they’d just witnessed. They had seen the risen Lord! Jesus was alive! Death was not the final answer. They perhaps hadn’t understood it all, but Jesus had met them in their sadness and He had turned it to gladness. He had been patient with them in walking with them in their confusion, but He had shown them the way.\n\nThat’s better than a surprise meeting with Attorney General (but I’ll recognize him next time!).\n\nWritten By Doug Serven\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    In his sermon, The Heavenly Discourse between Christ and Mary, 17th century theologian Richard Sibbes explained that it was love that moved Jesus forward throughout the entirety of His earthly ministry:\n\n“The same love of Christ that drew Him from heaven to the womb of the virgin, from the womb of the virgin to the cross, and from the cross to the grave […] moved Him to reveal Himself after He was risen from the grave to them that […] wonderfully loved him.”\n\nIn the post-resurrection appearances, the Scriptures highlight new revelations of Jesus’ love for His disciples. Jesus could have chosen to reveal Himself only once to the entire band of disciples prior to the ascension. That would have been sufficient to make them witnesses of His resurrection glory. However, He chose to reveal Himself to them repeatedly to teach them new depths of His love for them and to draw out of them new expressions of their love for Him. The first of these appearances is among the most significant.\n\nOn that first Easter morning, Mary Magdalene sat outside of the empty tomb, weeping. Perhaps she stayed out of a sense of abandonment and desperation; perhaps out of a sense of expectant hope. Whatever her reasons, of this much we can be sure: Mary stayed out of love for Christ. It was love for the Savior who had first loved her and had redeemed her that kept her at the tomb weeping and seeking. Mary longed to be with Jesus; and love always produces longing.\n\nMary’s longing to be with the Savior was so strong that she even disregarded the angels that appeared to her (John 20:12-13). The normal response of such a revelation is fear and awe. Mary was different. Her heart was consumed with love for Christ to such a degree that her longing to find Him caused everything else to fade from sight.\n\nWhen Jesus finally revealed Himself to Mary, He did so by tenderly calling her by name. Here was the Good Shepherd, calling one of His own by name (John 10:3). Jesus loved Mary, whose life had been wrecked by the bondage of sin. He assured her that He would never leave her nor forsake her—that He would love her to the very end.\n\nThe longing of the hearts of those who have been redeemed by the dying love of Jesus will never be frustrated. No matter how much despair, desperation, and disappointment may, at times, seem to take ownership of our hearts, the risen Jesus reveals Himself to us in new and powerful ways. He is intent on reminding us of how greatly He loves us, and on assuring us that our longings to be with Him are never in vain.\n\nWritten By Nick Batzig \n\n                ",

Definitely a better story than the one I’m telling you now: “The Time I Didn’t Meet John Cusack.”\n\nDisappointing? Sure. Life shattering? Not so much.\n\nOn the other hand, missing an encounter with the resurrected Jesus—now that is a big deal. For the life of me, I cannot understand the reaction of the guards at the tomb in Matthew. Let’s quickly recap: an angel shining like lightning appears, he rolls away the stone covering the tomb, the guards are so terrified that they completely pass out.\n\nSo far, I don’t fault them. Admittedly, that would have been a startling experience.\n\nHere’s where I do fault them though. When they came to, instead of looking for the resurrected Jesus, they decided to try to help the chief priests cover up the resurrection. WHAT?! Why?\n\nInstead of responding to this divine encounter, they chose to pursue temporal comfort and safety. They knew that not only their jobs, but also their lives were on the line. So they decided to collude with the powers that be instead of pursuing the only power that truly matters.\n\nI missed a chance to meet John Cusack; the soldiers missed an encounter with the resurrected Christ! When they awoke, they had a choice to make. Though they had witnessed an intensely powerful and spiritual series of events, they chose not to pursue spiritual awakening.\n\nWhat a sharp contrast to the centurion who was witness to the crucifixion of Jesus a few chapters earlier. “When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and exclaimed, ‘Surely He was the Son of God!’” (Matthew 27:54).\n\nOn my best days, I like to think I’m more like the centurion at the cross, who sees Christ and can’t help but utter a confession. However, I know there are times when I walk in the way of the guards at the tomb, who have encountered the power of God, but prefer to pursue earthly comfort and safety.\n\nThe temptation we all face in the wake of those encounters is to seek comfort or familiarity rather than seek Christ. When we do this, it makes us temporarily comfortable, but spiritually numb. Don’t make the same mistake the guards at the tomb did! In this season of resurrection pursue hope and life. Draw near to the resurrected and risen Jesus. He alone has the power to set us free. \n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    There will be times when you feel like God has forgotten you.\n\nMy wife and I recently had a really hard couple of years. We have dealt with a lot of loss, death, and transition in a short amount of time. I know what it feels like to be tempted to believe God has forgotten you.\n\nIn the first 12 verses of Psalm 139, we are reminded of truth that is stronger than our feelings. God is all-knowing, so He has not forgotten us.\n\nThe brokenness of this world does not mean God is blind. His silence does not mean He is absent. He is faithful and at work, even when His purpose is beyond what I am capable of seeing.\n\n“Even the darkness is not dark to You,” the psalmist says in verse 12. Even in the depths of my sin and rebellion, or my trials and circumstances, He has not abandoned me. He is with me. God is close to me when I am walking with Him in the light of the gospel, and He is just as close when I have fallen, the stain of shame causing me to hide. I am never beyond His reach. Verse 10 assures us of this promise: “even there Your hand will lead me; Your right hand will hold onto me.”\n\nVerses 13-18 of the Psalm tell us that our all-knowing, ever-present God is also the One who made us and gave us life. We are more than just a passing thought to Him.\n\nMany times my circumstances eclipse my faith. When something happens that I didn’t see coming, I often cannot find purpose in it. This Scripture reminds me that the Lord has been at work from the very beginning. He made me for a purpose and He is at work, even when I may not see how or understand why (Ephesians 2:10).\n\nThe last verses of the Psalm (vs.19-24) proclaim the justice and sovereignty of God. An all-knowing God who can see the hearts and intentions of a man is also a God who judges fairly. We can trust God’s judgment so much that the psalmist calls us to invite it: “Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my concerns. See if there is any offensive way in me; lead me in the everlasting way” (vs. 23-24).\n\nJesus said, “In this world you will have trouble, but take heart because I have overcome the world” (John 16:33). You are on God’s mind. He knows your days as well as the trouble that may fill them. He is all-knowing, faithful, and strong. This psalm is a poem to our hearts that God has us, no matter what. Rest in that.\n\nWritten by Britton Sharp\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I remember rebuilding an engine with my father-in-law a few years ago. I am a fairly handy guy. I can fix just about anything if I can find the time. I can work on stuff around the house, take down big trees with my chainsaw, build furniture from scratch. But if you place me in front of an engine, I freeze. I have no idea how things work. All I can see is a big chunk of metal.\n\nThere are two obvious challenges to reading Psalm 136. First, you may feel like I do when looking under the hood of a car: you see one thing. You see the phrase, “His love is eternal,” and it is hard to look past it to the other dynamics of the song. It starts to sound like a broken record no matter how many times you read it because the refrain is all you can see.\n\nOr, you may be like my father-in-law who is a genius with cars. He understands the story of the engine. He looks beyond the big chunk of metal to how all the pieces work together. You might be one who sees the alternating lines, the unfolding story of creation and redemption.\n\nIf we want to read this Psalm well, we have to see both the big picture and the details at the same time. They work together. Through the story, God reveals to us that His love is eternal. And because of His eternal love, the story exists. Each aspect of this Psalm comments on the other.\n\nFather Patrick Reardon, in his book Christ in the Psalms, says this Psalm is about “creation, deliverance, and the continued care of the redeemed.” Psalm 136 is about the “ongoingness” of God’s love. Out of His love God created. Out of His love He delivered and redeemed. And out of His love He will hold His people up, move them forward, and continually guide them in His ways.\n\nIf that is God’s story and we are God’s people, then this is our story as well. We are created out of love. We are redeemed by it. And we will be held up by it. When our faith is in Christ, we are the recipients of this wonderful truth, and our stories prove this Psalm true over and over again. Give thanks to God for His unfailing, unending, always-keeping love.\n\nWritten by Father Aaron Wright\n\n \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    This passage is known as a “messianic Psalm,” meaning it speaks about the coming Messiah. Read it and see what parts seem to speak of Jesus.\n\nJesus quoted this Psalm three times: first, when He entered Jerusalem in Mark 11:9. Next, when speaking of how He would be rejected, He quoted verses 22-23 (Mark 12:10-11). And last, He referred to verse 27 when He said in John 8:12, “I am the light of the world.” This last reference is particularly potent, because verse 27 talks about binding the festal sacrifice to the horns of the altar. This is a reference to Jesus as the Lamb of God, and it is also the most striking image we have of God’s deliverance and steadfast love— the sacrifice of His Son.\n\nThis is a psalm of thanksgiving for the steadfast love of God that delivers us from trouble and keeps us in His care. Toward the beginning, the Psalm seems to have a particular occasion of deliverance in mind, the specifics of which are lost to history. But then the Psalm does what so many of these poems do— it moves from a specific situation to the unchanging, unfailing nature of God. This technique invites us, as the readers, to consider our own particular stories as we look at how the unchanging character of God has met us.\n\nConsider your own personal experiences with God’s steadfast love and deliverance. Read the Psalm and see what the Holy Spirit calls to mind. From what have you been delivered? Where have you seen the steadfast love of the Lord present in your life?\n\nThe Lord has given us the light of His Son to shine upon our darkness. May we give thanks that our hope is anchored in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. “Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good. His faithful love endures forever” (vs. 29).\n\n written by Britton Sharp\n\n                ",

While there are many benefits to this—like being able to connect with friends who are far away, or having access to archives of information at the click of a button—our ability to get what we want (and get it now) plays a key role in how we view what is most desirable. Fast is good. Slow is bad. “My own” is good. “Ours together” is not as good.\n\nIn Psalm 103, David writes a poem of gratitude to God based on the grand scope of the Lord’s compassion. David gives a picture of a God who rescues us, heals us, forgives us, satisfies us, and renews us (vs.1-5). But the way David frames the faithfulness of God is almost the opposite of an “I want it all and I want it now” mentality. Life in Christ is focused on “us” more than it is focused on “me.” It takes into view “forever” more than “now.” It recognizes comprehensive mercy more than focusing on individual sins (vs.10-12).\n\nDavid tells us God has treated His people with this sort of compassion since before the days of Moses (vs.6-7). Not only that, the Lord’s loving-kindness comes to us in promises that reach forward to the generations to come. Think about that: God’s mercy reaches forward to the descendants of the faithful and it also reaches back to generations past. Yes, the benefits of God’s mercy come to individual people; but those blessings pass through us, down into the lives of those who come after us, and they reach us because God has dealt mercifully with those who have come before us (v.17).\n\nThe faithfulness of God outlasts us and it predates us. This helps us when we are overwhelmed with anxiety because our focus is on ourselves, right now. God deals kindly with us by reminding us that we are not the heroes of our own stories. We never have been. We are supporting characters in an epic that has been underway since long before we were born, and which will carry on long after we have died. We are folded into that story through faith in the kindness and mercy of God, which we find in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nMay we thank the Lord that His mercy is anchored in promises given to people who lived long before we were born, and that those same promises hold for all eternity. The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love (v.8). He always has been and He always will be. In Christ, He gives us everything we need, forever. Bless His name.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    This Psalm calls us to praise God, to make a joyful noise before our King. Without a doubt, there are countless reasons to praise Him. We see 3 of these in the first 3 verses of the Psalm: \n\nHe has done marvelous things (v. 1).\nHe has made known His salvation to the nations (v. 2).\nHe has never forgotten His steadfast love and faithfulness (v. 3). \n\nThese are all great reasons to break into joyous song. But the psalmist lists another, less obvious reason for shouting with joy: \n\n“for the Lord comes to judge the earth” (v. 9).\n\nJudgment is not something we often sing about. It tends to bring conviction and discomfort. But according to Scripture, the Lord’s judgment should cause us, with all of creation, to clap our hands, bring together instruments, and make a triumphant melody.\n\nWhy should we react in such a counter-intuitive way? Because God has indeed remembered His steadfast love and faithfulness to Israel in the person of Jesus Christ (v. 3). Jesus, in His faithfulness, died for us, the consistently unfaithful. Jesus, in His steadfast love, died for us who waver in our love. \n\nBecause Jesus justified us by His blood, we can rejoice in the judgment of the earth. Because of Jesus’ steadfast love and faithfulness, we are, through faith in Him, declared righteous before God. \n\nAnd so we sing. Because we have a deep joy and an eternal right standing before God, we break forth into a new song. \n\nWe make joyful noises with all of creation. We sing for the marvelous things He’s done, for the wonders He’s performed. We shout that He’s made the victory of His salvation known to all the nations. We rejoice that He will judge the world righteously. On that day—by grace alone — we will stand forgiven, covered in Christ’s righteousness. \n\nMay we sing a new song. \n\nWritten by Billy Jack Brawner\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The Psalms are the prayer book of Jesus. They are alive with wisdom and beauty, always painting a picture of the character of Israel’s God. Each and every “Selah” (meaning silence or pause) gives space for contemplation or praise.\n\nThese songs were most certainly part of Jesus’ childhood. He heard them sung in the synagogues. He heard them in the hustle and bustle of His family’s annual trip to the Temple in Jerusalem. Jesus knew the Psalms. However, the Psalms knew Him as well. Jesus is the pray-er of the Psalms.\n\nWe (and I hope I can bunch you in with me) can have a hard time reading the Psalms. This is probably because they weren’t originally meant to be read. They were meant to be sung— together. They were built to sink deep into our bones and become a part of us. Try it sometime.\n\nPsalm 66 is very special. It was sung during the Passover to remind Israel of their journey out of Egypt. Read it again in that light. Do you hear it? Do you see it? A deliverance has taken place. David recalls the beginning of the Exodus and how God delivered His people from bondage.\n\nBut here is the really cool thing: every Easter, millions of Christians all around the world begin their Easter service with this Psalm. They say it, sing it, chant it, and proclaim it. God has delivered us from bondage through Christ. Read it now in that light. The work of God through Christ is woven all the way through. God has moved towards us (v. 19).\n\nAs we near Advent and Christmas, we remember the God who delivers His people from bondage. He delivered the world from the clutches of the enemy by way of the cross, resurrection, and ascension. It is finished, as Jesus said (John 19:30).\n\nWhat does this mean for us? This means God will deliver you. He will hear your prayer. If you are like me and prayer doesn’t come easily, I have a great recommendation. Pray the prayers of Jesus. Allow the words of this Psalm, and the others, to sink deep into your bones. As you pray the Psalms, you will find yourself praying the words our Lord Himself prayed. He knew them and He is in them. He will listen. His faithful love will be turned toward you. Selah.\n\nWritten by Father Aaron Wright\n\n                ",

She has countless stories filled with love and joy and laughter, but she also has stories filled with profound brokenness and tragedy and death. I remember asking her if, in the middle of it all, she had ever questioned God—whether or not He was good, or if He even existed. Her response has stuck with me: “No. No, I didn’t. He was all I had. He was the only thing in life that I couldn’t question.”\n\nMy grandma’s words carry a tone similar to that of this Psalm. She knows what it’s like to be stuck in the desolate pit, waiting on the Lord. She knows what it’s like to be poor, in need of the Lord. And she knows what it’s like to be rescued and to sing a new song—to be delivered by her steadfast and faithful God.\n\nThis Psalm reads like a winding road, like a snapshot of various chapters in David’s life. There are times we hear David cry out from the pit of destruction, and times we see him singing a new song, his feet firmly on a rock (vv.1-3). There are moments of deliverance and moments when he is overtaken by his own sins (vv.9-13).\n\nDavid’s life is all over the place, just like mine and yours. There are stories of joy and stories of tragedy.\n\nAs unpredictable as David’s life seems, this Psalm reminds us that God is more steadfast and faithful still. God had wonderful plans for David (v.5), He preserved David’s heart (v.10), and He was David’s help and deliverer (v.17). The Psalm even says that the Lord thinks of David—God is mindful of him (v.17). In all of David’s ups and downs, God proved Himself worthy to be trusted and praised. In all of my grandma’s ups and downs, He has proven the same.\n\nYou and I will also grow old. We, too, will have stories of joy and stories of tragedy. May we have eyes to see the faithfulness of God. May we remember He is worthy of our trust, even in the waiting, even in our failures, and even when our enemies pursue. May we have the grace to sing a new song, a hymn of praise to our God—our helper and deliverer.\n\nWritten by Billy Jack Brawner\n\n                ",

Or have you ever felt that your particular struggle was so unique and complex it would take more help than usual for God to rescue you?\n\nI wonder if this is how David felt when he wrote this psalm. King Saul, who was jealous of David’s fame and of God’s anointing upon him as the next king of Israel, had threatened to kill David, forcing him to abandon his home country. When you are hunted by the king, no place is safe.\n\nDavid’s situation became so bad that he fled to Gath, a foreign country, for refuge. When the king of Gath recognized who David was, he didn’t trust him. Suddenly David was more alone and at risk than ever. He actually pretended to be insane in order to escape with his life (1 Samuel 21:10-15).\n\nPsalm 34 is David’s prayer after escaping from Gath. In humility, “this poor man cried, and the Lord heard him and saved him from all his troubles” (v.6).\n\nDoes God hear us in the scary places, when life hasn’t turned out like we hoped? Let this Psalm encourage us. God answers His people; He delivers us. The Lord hears; the Lord saves (vs. 4-7). What a caring, faithful God we serve.\n\nDavid has come to know God’s care in a personal way. He knows firsthand that “the Lord is near to the brokenhearted and He saves the crushed in spirit. The Lord redeems the life of His servants; none of those who take refuge in Him will be condemned” (vs. 18, 22). Though we know David’s troubles were quite specific (running from Saul and then from the king of Gath), the comfort this psalm offers concerning the character of God is quite general: He delivers the righteous from trouble, His eyes are on His people, and He hears their prayers.\n\nWhen our struggles can appear unique and complicated, leaving us feeling alone, it helps to know that the God who cares for us is utterly competent to untangle all sorts of knots. Nothing surprises or stumps Him. Pray this psalm as a way to lay your specific struggles at the feet of your God. He is your present help in times of trouble (Psalm 46:1).\n\nWritten by David Henderson\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Who gets to tell us what to do? All of us live by some sort of law or code. Even a code of anarchy is a law unto itself. Scripture is filled with laws—rules for life and faith handed down to the people of God by the Lord Himself. In Psalm 19, King David gives us a poem of gratitude for the gift of God’s Law.\n\nWhy did God give us instruction? Church fathers talk about the three uses of God’s Law. It has been given to 1) hold up a mirror so that we might see our own inability to live righteous lives, 2) restrain evil in the world by teaching us how to conduct ourselves personally and communally, and 3) reveal what is pleasing to the Lord, whom His people seek to serve.\n\nKing David calls not only himself but the people he leads to hold God’s law with a great affection. How does David make his case?\n\nHe begins by addressing the question: Has God spoken to His people? If the Maker has turned a deaf ear toward His creation, we are hopeless. But David tells us God is always speaking, everywhere. The heavens declare His glory. The sky proclaims His handiwork. There is no corner of creation over which God does not speak (Psalm 19:1-6).\n\nSo what, exactly, does God say? David says God tells us how to live in His creation. In fact, David doesn’t just say this, he exclaims it! God has given us a perfect law. It guides us. It gives wisdom to the simple. It is not merely a set of rules; it is a description for how to live well. It doesn’t weary us; it revives us.\n\nGod’s law reigns in we who are prone to wander, acting as a guardrail beside the cliffs of foolishness. It leads to a life of joy and draws from us a response of awe that is meant to last forever. This is what David says the Law is meant to do, and he thanks God for it (Psalm 19:7-8).\n\nIt is a mark of spiritual maturity to thank God for His law, because when we express this gratitude, it means we understand how much we need all these benefits God’s Law gives. We don’t approach the Law as a way to make God love us, but we see it as something He has given to us because He already does (Psalm 19:13).\n\nAs we read this psalm, let us make it a prayer of thanks so that our gratitude for the Law of God will echo David’s words at the end: May the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in your sight, O LORD, our Rock and our Redeemer.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

The first three verses would have been sung by pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem. The last two verses would have been the response of those in the temple gates calling the travelers to come inside.\n\nWhat, exactly, are we invited to do? The six imperatives that structure the Psalm tell us.\n\nShout triumphantly to the Lord – I usually avoid shouting. So when I come across a command like this, I get a little uncomfortable. What does this really mean? The word used here means to sound an alarm. If there was a fire, we would certainly make sure to alert those around us. In this passage we are called to actively alert others to the significance of the Glory of the Lord.\n\nServe the Lord with gladness – Worship is always a matter of the heart. A heart transformed by His grace is a heart that finds joy in serving Him.\n\nCome into His presence with singing – We are invited to let our gladness spill over into song. Singing is a way to verbalize our joy. Isn’t is amazing that God delights in music? Rather than cowering in shame before the Almighty, we are invited into His presence, rejoicing in the power of the gospel.\n\nAcknowledge that Yahweh is God – Here we are invited to humbly lay down our self-reliance and acknowledge the power and authority of God. We are invited to orient ourselves around the gospel of Jesus Christ, the perfect provision of Yahweh.\n\nEnter His gates – Next, we are called to move beyond ourselves and enter into something more, something greater. The people inside the temple walls would extend this call to those outside. The object of our worship, God, invites us to enter into His presence.\n\nGive thanks to Him – Thankfulness comes from awareness. If I am not thankful, it is most likely because I am unaware of what I have been given. When we give thanks to God, we contemplate His greatness. We see more of who He is and what He has done. The appropriate response here is gratitude.\n\nShout. Serve. Sing. Acknowledge. Enter. Give thanks. “Yahweh is good and His love is eternal; His faithfulness endures through all generations” (vs. 5).\n\nThis is the invitation. Will you join in?\n\nWritten by Britton Sharp\n\n                ",

We sing the national anthem at sporting events. We sing in church (sometimes). We say that good news is music to our ears and the sound of bacon frying is sweet music too. But do our souls sing?\n\nThat’s the refrain of “How Great Thou Art”— “Then sings my soul…”\n\nBut what does that mean?\n\nMy guess is that each of us knows what it means even if it is not the phrase we’ve used. Maybe we’ve never put words to the experience of the soaring, lifting, and filling of the soul—to the passion and joy that sometimes wells up in us— or maybe we can’t put words to it. But each verse of this hymn paints a picture of those things that might make a soul sing.\n\nVerse one looks at the cosmos, the whole universe. It sees the power and bigness and majesty of God’s creation expanding beyond our sight, bigger than our comprehension. I think about lying in a canoe at night in the Boundary Waters of Northern Minnesota, staring at a sky so full of stars that it’s nearly as bright as the dawn. That makes my soul sing.\n\nVerse two focuses in on the tangible creation—the sounds of birds and beautiful mountain views. I think of climbing House Mountain in East Tennessee, scrambling over boulders and pulling myself up on saplings and over fallen trees so that I could step onto a rocky outcrop and see the view of the valley below. The breeze cooled me and the quiet was so still that I could hear my soul sing then too.\n\nWhile those verses offer hints of what it is that fills our soul, verses 3 and 4 dive deep into what the song of our souls really is. Yes, God created a majestic beautiful world that makes us feel and yearn, but we don’t find fullness in that. He did something more. He sent His Son to take our sins from us, to suffer and die on our behalf, to bear the burden we could not bear. Indeed, “I scarce can take it in.”\n\nBut that is not all.\n\nThe final glorious stanza of the hymn reveals the final glorious stanza of God’s mission – Christ shall come and will be greeted with shouts of praise. We will “bow in humble adoration” because His glory will be so great. Wrongs will be made right. Sin and pain will be abolished. There is only one response to this: “My God, how great Thou Art!”\n\nWhat makes your soul sing? Don’t stop at the song of nature, no matter how beautiful it is. Find the truest soul song there is in the work Jesus Christ has done for you.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\nHow Great Thou Art\nCarl Gustav Boberg, 1885; Stuart K. Hine, c. 1920\n\nO Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder\nConsider all the worlds thy hands have made,\nI see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,\nThy power throughout the universe displayed:\n\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee:\nHow great thou art! How great thou art!\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee:\nHow great thou art! How great thou art!\n\nWhen through the woods and forest glades I wander\nAnd hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,\nWhen I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,\nAnd hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze:\n\nAnd when I think that God, his Son not sparing,\nSent him to die, I scarce can take it in,\nThat on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,\nHe bled and died to take away my sin.\n\nWhen Christ shall come with shout of acclamation\nAnd take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!\nThen I shall bow in humble adoration,\nAnd there proclaim, My God, how great thou art!\n\n          ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    In 1738, Charles Wesley was struggling to find peace with God. He had served as a missionary to Georgia, but that had turned out disastrously bad. Peter Bohler, the leader of the London Moravians, asked Charles if he hoped to be saved. Charles replied that he did. Bohler pressed, “Upon what basis do you hope to be saved?” Wesley said, “Because I have used my best endeavors to serve God.” Bohler shook his head sadly and walked away.\n\nWesley recorded his reaction in his journal: “What, are not my endeavors a sufficient ground of hope? Would he rob me of my endeavors? I have nothing else to trust to.”\n\nWesley was stuck in the tension that many raised in church have experienced. It is all too common to confuse the fruits of the gospel at work in our lives (good endeavors) with the root of spiritual life (the gospel promise believed).\n\nThe problem with trusting our good works is that they are not perfect works. Jesus said that we are to love Him with all our heart, all our mind, and all our strength, and this is a considerably higher bar than just offering Him our best endeavors.\n\nGod requires that we love Him perfectly from the moment we are born until the moment we die, with no lapses. Faced with this impossible requirement, many religious people attempt to take solace in such empty hopes as our best, though imperfect, endeavors. But this hymn points us to a higher ground of hope—the power of the gospel.\n\nLater in 1738, Wesley’s friend, John Bray, discovered Martin Luther’s Commentary on Galatians and brought it to Wesley, who was sick in bed. Luther had famously once said that the whole of the gospel was found in the personal pronouns, and Wesley found peace as the Lord gave him faith to believe that Jesus had died for him. Wesley wrote in his journal, “I spent some hours this evening in private with Martin Luther, who was greatly blessed to me, especially his conclusion of the second chapter. I labored, waited, and prayed to feel ‘Who loved me and gave Himself up for me.’”\n\nIt is sometimes said that “And Can It Be” was Wesley’s first hymn, written soon after his conversion. Hymn scholars are now convinced that “Where Shall My Wondering Soul Begin?” was actually his first hymn. But “And Can It Be” was written soon after and expresses beautifully and powerfully the converting power of the gospel that he had experienced.\n\nWesley is one of our most skilled hymn writers. He begins with a piercing question to which no real answer can be given: “How can it be, that thou my God, shoulds’t die for me?” If we ever get to the point where God’s grace seems deserved or expected, we are in deep trouble.\n\nWe see Wesley’s grasp of Luther’s point in his use of personal pronouns: “my God,” “for me.” But it is in the last verse where Wesley reveals the heart of his new-found hope. “Alive in Him, my living head, and clothed in righteousness divine.”\n\nWesley had come to understand that the gospel Christ gives us what God requires—His perfect righteousness through our union with Him. What Christ does, we get credit for; what He deserves, we get!\n\nRather than trusting in our best endeavors, Wesley gives us words to praise God for our only true hope, the righteousness of Christ imputed to His people through faith. This brings us not only hope, but boldness to claim the crown—not because of what we have done, but because of what Christ has done in our place.\n\nWritten by Kevin Twit \n\nAnd Can It Be That I Should Gain?\nCharles Wesley, 1738\n\nAnd can it be that I should gain\nAn interest in the Savior’s blood?\nDied He for me, who caused His pain—\nFor me, who Him to death pursued?\nAmazing love! How can it be,\nThat Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?\nAmazing love! How can it be,\nThat Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?\n\nHe left His Father’s throne above\nSo free, so infinite His grace—\nEmptied Himself of all but love,\nAnd bled for Adam’s helpless race:\n’Tis mercy all, immense and free,\nFor O my God, it found out me!\n’Tis mercy all, immense and free,\nFor O my God, it found out me!\n\nLong my imprisoned spirit lay,\nFast bound in sin and nature’s night;\nThine eye diffused a quickening ray—\nI woke, the dungeon flamed with light;\nMy chains fell off, my heart was free,\nI rose, went forth, and followed Thee.\nMy chains fell off, my heart was free,\nI rose, went forth, and followed Thee.\n\nNo condemnation now I dread;\nJesus, and all in Him, is mine;\nAlive in Him, my living Head,\nAnd clothed in righteousness divine,\nBold I approach th’eternal throne,\nAnd claim the crown, through Christ my own.\nBold I approach th’eternal throne,\nAnd claim the crown, through Christ my own.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Few hymn writers have had a greater impact on Christian worship than Isaac Watts. With more than 750 hymns to his name, Watts has been dubbed the Father of English Hymnody for good reason, penning some of the most beloved worship refrains in the English-speaking world.\n\nFrom the triumphant “Joy to the World,” celebrating the Savior’s birth, to the moving “When I Survey the Wondrous Cross,” reflecting on the Savior’s death, Watts packs profound gospel truths into memorable poetic phrases with every lyric he writes.\n\nWatts’ gospel truth packed into poetic phrase is on bright display in today’s hymn. As the title indicates, Watts wanted to deepen our worship of God by growing our understanding of true blessing and reflecting on the nature of repentant faith.\n\n“Blessing” is a word we throw around a lot. We get a promotion at work, or a new healthy baby is born, and we say we are blessed. As a kid in Sunday School, I remember having to list out my blessings: my baseball bat, hot dogs, the swimming pool, and yes, even my sister. I was taught that every good thing in my life was, in some way, a blessing from God.\n\nWhat I didn’t understand then was that the concept of “blessing” is far more than physical or material favors from God. In fact, blessing lies at the center of God’s redemptive purpose. In Genesis 12:3, God tells Abraham that through him the blessing of salvation will extend to all the families of the earth. In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul tells us this blessing to Abraham extends to us through the person and work of Jesus Christ (Galatians 3:13-14).\n\nWatts, in this hymn, reflects on the blessing of salvation and how we receive it through repentant faith in Jesus Christ. Repentant faith begins when “sins with sorrow are confessed.” When truly grieved and broken over our sin, we come out of hiding. We must step out from behind the trees and the fig leaves (Genesis 3) and acknowledge our sin before God (Psalm 32:5).\n\nIf we do this, scary as it is, God will give us grace. We will be “covered with the Savior’s blood.” In a paradox that lies at the heart of the gospel, Watts teaches us that we must disrobe in order to be robed. We must own our guilt before God in order to know “how glorious is that righteousness that hides and cancels all my sin.”  \n\nWhen we begin to experience the power of God’s grace covering our shame and guilt, a new life takes hold. We become new creatures in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17) and “the bright evidences of grace” begin to “appear and shine” in every facet of our lives. This is what it means to be blessed.\n\nBlest is the man who knows the grace of our God.\n\nWritten By Nate Shurden\n\nBlest is the Man, Forever Blest\nIsaac Watts, 1719\n\nBlest is the man, forever blest,\nWhose guilt is pardoned by his God,\nWhose sins with sorrow are confessed\nAnd covered with his Savior’s blood.\n\nBlest is the man to whom the Lord\nImputes not his iniquities;\nHe pleads no merit of reward\nAnd not on works but grace relies.\n\nFrom guile his heart and lips are free;\nHis humble joy, his holy fear,\nWith deep repentance well agree\nAnd join to prove his faith sincere.\n\nHow glorious is that righteousness\nThat hides and cancels all his sins,\nWhile bright the evidence of grace\nThro’ all his life appears and shines!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Rudyard Kipling, inspired by Samuel Stone’s “The Church’s One Foundation,” wrote a hymn of his own called “Hymn Before Action.” It can be sung to the same tune, but I must warn you that its content is radically different from Stone’s. Kipling invokes God’s aid to support blatantly imperial aims.\n\nKipling’s message may hit a little closer to home than we’d like to admit. Have you ever sought God’s help for something that was really just a selfish wish? I have. We are naturally inclined to think opportunistically of our relationship with God. We have our own ideas about what we want and how God should help us fulfill our wishes. I am grateful that God is both faithful and gracious, dealing patiently even with my presumptuous and petty ways.\n\nUnlike Kipling, Stone’s theme is not about the imperial aims of man, but the kingdom of God. It is part of a series of hymns which expound on the declarations of the Apostle’s Creed. In this hymn, Stone addresses the theme of the Church universal, and the communion of the saints.\n\nThis hymn is a reminder of what our forgetful hearts need to hear again and again: Christ is our all. He is the one foundation.\n\nHow often we build our lives on false hopes, false foundations, and the lure of worldly success. We seek to build the church on false visions of success—like size, numbers, facilities, and programs—while neglecting the preeminence of Christ. Our hearts are inclined to supplant Jesus and replace Him with our own designs.\n\nIt is precisely this “do-it-yourself” kind of faith that Christ confounds. Psalm 127:1 says, “Except the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain that build it.” I think I read this verse over a thousand times before I noticed that God Himself was the builder. Somehow, I always read this and thought it meant that I should build on my own, after getting some architectural direction from God.\n\nThat’s not what the verse says. God is the builder. He has established the church. He builds it. And my communion with Him and with the saints is not rooted in what I have done, but in what He has done. Indeed, Peter declares that we are “living Stones” (1 Peter 2:5). Our chief duty is to rest in Christ and rest upon the foundation He has laid.\n\nAny activity we invest in that is not fixed upon Christ is vanity. Any program we concoct, any relationship we foster, any prayer we utter is vain labor apart from Him.\n\nStone reminds us that only in Christ do we find peace, sustenance, hope, joy, life, beauty, glory, reconciliation, love, salvation, identity, comfort, endurance, strength, and grace. Christ alone fills all in all (Ephesians 1:23).\n\nWritten By Caleb Faires\n\nThe Church’s One Foundation\nSamuel J. Stone, 1866\n\nThe Church’s one foundation\nIs Jesus Christ her Lord,\nShe is His new creation\nBy water and the Word.\nFrom heaven He came and sought her\nTo be His holy bride;\nWith His own blood He bought her\nAnd for her life He died.\n\nShe is from every nation,\nYet one o’er all the earth;\nHer charter of salvation,\nOne Lord, one faith, one birth;\nOne holy Name she blesses,\nPartakes one holy food,\nAnd to one hope she presses,\nWith every grace endued.\n\n’Mid toil and tribulation,\nAnd tumult of her war,\nShe waits the consummation\nOf peace forevermore;\nTill, with the vision glorious,\nHer longing eyes are blest,\nAnd the great Church victorious\nShall be the Church at rest.\n\nYet she on earth hath union\nWith God the Three in One,\nAnd mystic sweet communion\nWith those whose rest is won,\nWith all her sons and daughters\nWho, by the Master’s hand\nLed through the deathly waters,\nRepose in Eden land.\n\nO happy ones and holy!\nLord, give us grace that we\nLike them, the meek and lowly,\nOn high may dwell with Thee:\nThere, past the border mountains,\nWhere in sweet vales the Bride\nWith Thee by living fountains\nForever shall abide!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Frances Jean “Fanny” Crosby (1820-1915), an only child from Brewster, New York, was one of the most prolific hymn writers the world has ever seen, composing over 8,000 hymns, along with several books and over 1,000 poems. Because publishers in her day were often reluctant to publish a woman’s work, Fanny used more than 200 masculine pseudonyms over the course of her career.\n\nBlind from an early age, Crosby saw the world through her mind’s eye. She would begin to compose a hymn in her head, and once she had it written on her memory, she would then recite it to her personal stenographer who would write it down for her. She often worked on 5 or 6 hymns at a time, each floating in its own corner of her imagination until she felt ready to let it out.\n\nIn describing her hymn-writing process, Crosby once said: “It may seem a little old-fashioned, always to begin one’s work with prayer, but I never undertake a hymn without first asking the good Lord to be my inspiration.” The hymn “Blessed Assurance” reveals that she did indeed believe her Lord to be good.\n\n“Blessed Assurance” is an exploration of the wonder of what it means to walk presently in what Peter calls a “living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead” (1 Pet 1:3). For Fanny Crosby, one thing this “living hope” means is that we have a reason, right now, to celebrate with the confidence to draw near to God, trusting that He will never cast us away. This hymn celebrates the goodness of being at ease in a confident and perfect love that casts out fear (1 John 4:18).\n\n“Blessed Assurance” in unashamedly happy. Crosby uses words like foretaste, praising, delight, happy, goodness, and, of course, blessed to give the song its buoyancy. In a cynical world, a hymn like this is refreshing. Crosby isn’t offering Christians a false sense of optimism. She is articulating the sure and eternal benefits of the work of Christ given to the believer. “Blessed Assurance” invites us to “draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water” (Heb 10:22).\n\nFor the blind hymn writer from New York, passages like 1 John 4:7-19, Hebrews 10:19-23, and 1 Peter 1:3-9 were cause for celebration, which is what this hymn sets out to do. The Christian’s hope for happiness and peace is not wishful thinking. It is based on what we have already been promised because of the finished work of Christ—a blessed assurance that Jesus is ours.\n\nBLESSED ASSURANCE\nFanny Crosby, 1873\n\nBlessed assurance; Jesus is mine!\nOh, what a foretaste of glory divine!\nHeir of salvation, purchase of God,\nborn of his Spirit, washed in his blood.\n\nThis is my story, this is my song,\npraising my Savior all the day long;\nthis is my story, this is my song,\npraising my Savior all the day long.\n\nPerfect submission, perfect delight,\nvisions of rapture now burst on my sight;\nangels descending bring from above\nechoes of mercy, whispers of love. \n\nPerfect submission, all is at rest,\nI in my Savior am happy and blest;\nwatching and waiting, looking above,\nfilled with his goodness, lost in his love. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The entire planet is feeling the ache right now, but creation has been groaning under the weight of its curse since sin and death first invaded our world. COVID-19 may be new, but the weariness of this age is not. Still, the headlines tell us these times are unprecedented: Millions are in home quarantine. Restaurants, shops, and markets have been shuttered. Every major sports league has been benched. Local churches have moved their services online in the name of social distancing. It seems to me we need the good news of Resurrection Sunday more than ever.\n\nFor most of the people alive on planet earth that first Easter morning two thousand years ago, it was just an ordinary Sunday. Folks going about their lives in China, India, Spain, or Ethiopia would not have known that a new era had dawned, that the true King of Creation had just crushed the power of sin and death, and that the curse that had been twisted around this world was beginning to unravel.\n\nAccording to Luke, the first to hear the news was a group of women who came to Jesus’s tomb early on Sunday morning. “He is not here, but he has risen!” the angels announced (Luke 24:6). And from there the news spread—to Peter and the other disciples (vv.9–11), then to two Jesus-followers on the road to Emmaus (vv.13–35), and then to more people still, including five hundred people on one occasion (1Corinthians 15:6). Those early Christians shared the good news, and it spread from person to person across the world. You and I are included in this great unbreakable chain that has weaved and wound its way across time and space, bringing the joy of the gospel to all who will receive it.\n\nIt strikes me that in these days of uncertainty, we need the certainty of the gospel more than ever. The good news of Jesus is not a get-out-of-hell-free card; it is so much more than that. It is a promise that this world will be made new—that every sad, jagged, and broken thing will one day be stilled.\n\nWhen the stone was rolled away that first Resurrection Sunday morning, a new age began. But it wasn’t the dawn of a new epoch the way we often think of it. That is, there wasn’t a clean break with the old. God is actively rescuing people from the darkness, bringing them into His kingdom of light (Colossians 1:13; see also 1John 2:8–9). To do that, He has allowed the two ages to overlap, at least until Jesus returns.\n\nOn that day, the things that belong to the old world will be no more. Suffering and fear will be obliterated, along with the curse. Those who know Christ will awaken to a new morning where life will know no bounds and light will no longer meet darkness. The Bible tells us there will be tears, but it will be God Himself who wipes them from our cheeks (Revelation 21:4). This is our hope not only on Easter Sunday, but on each and every day we have breath in our lungs. Come quickly, Lord Jesus!\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

Scripture doesn’t tell us much about what took place that day, though it’s not hard to imagine the mood among the disciples.\n\nThey had followed Jesus for three years, only to abandon Him in His time of need, and now He was gone. They had seen Him perform incredible signs and miracles—calming the waves, healing the sick, and even raising others from the dead. But if He was so powerful, the Son of God even, how could He let them arrest Him like a common crook? How could He let them flay the skin of His back with a cruelly fashioned whip? How could He let them nail His frail frame to a Roman cross? It was all too much to take in.\n\nHoly Saturday is a day of questions and discomfort, of sadness and searching. It is the day that lies between what has come before and what is yet to come. It belongs neither to Jesus’s earthly life, nor to His resurrected glory. Like I said, it feels like a lost day. And in that, I feel very much at home.\n\nAs followers of Christ, we live between the already and the not yet. Jesus’s earthly life is behind us. We were not there to see the miracles for ourselves. We did not witness Him walking on water or healing the lepers. We weren’t there the moment He called Lazarus from the tomb. And Jesus’s triumphant return is still ahead of us. We can only imagine what it will be like to see Him face-to-face, to watch as He puts an end to the curse of sin and the machinations of the devil, once and for all. Until then, We’re caught in the middle, in a lifetime’s worth of Holy Saturdays.\n\nBut even for all our waiting, we are in a place the disciples of Jesus could only have dreamed about on Holy Saturday. We have Christ with us. His Spirit—the Holy Spirit—dwells inside every believer. Jesus had promised as much:\n\n“I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you” (John 14:18).\n\nBecause this is true, Holy Saturday has been transformed into a reminder to aim our longings at heaven. We have been given the gift of constant and continual fellowship with the Son of God. He’s with us, no matter what. So we don’t need to give discouragement and fear the last word when the world gets us down. We can share our burdens with Jesus.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n               ",

Tucked into the second chapter of 1 Corinthians, it’s easy to skim right past it. In discussing the wisdom of God, Paul writes, “None of the rulers of this age knew this wisdom, because if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory” (1Corinthians 2:8). Knowing that Jesus “was delivered up according to God’s determined plan and foreknowledge” (Acts 2:23), it seems that God used the devious schemes of the enemy to bring about the world’s greatest blessing.\n\nPilate and the Jewish religious leaders had no idea what they were actually doing. Neither did the spiritual forces behind their power. (These dark gods were likely on Paul’s mind when he referred to the “rulers of this age.”) Neither did Jesus’s own disciples get it. It seems even those who remained close to Jesus in His agony had no idea the great victory that was being won on Good Friday. On that day, “Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed his last” (Mark 15:37), and that was the end—or so everyone thought.\n\nI can’t think of anything worse than the murder of God. Good Friday, in that sense, is the darkest day in the history of the human race. Whatever atrocities or injustices our world has committed (or has yet to commit), they all pale in comparison with the moment when we nailed the perfect and innocent Son of God to a Roman cross and let His torn and bruised body twist in the wind. It’s gruesome beyond belief. But God shaped the greatest tragedy into the turning point of history.\n\nOn the cross, Jesus bore the weight of our sins (1Peter 2:24). He redeemed all those who trust in His name, providing forgiveness and pouring out the grace of God (Ephesians 1:7), even as His blood poured to the earth below. He did this so that we could draw near to God (1Peter 3:18), so that you and I could have eternal life (John 3:16). And through His death, Jesus destroyed the power of Satan (Hebrews 2:14).\n\nBut no one knew any of this when the nails were hammered into place. No one realized what God was doing when the sky turned dark and the rocks split open (Mark 15:33; Matthew 27:51). No one knew about the beautiful thing happening in the ugliness of the moment. Good Friday is good, not because of anything we did. To the contrary, we made it horrific. Even though none of us were alive back then to condemn Jesus, our sins made His sacrifice necessary. We are to blame. So Good Friday is good for one simple reason: God is good.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    We call it “the Last Supper,” but I’ve come to believe it should properly be called “the Last Supper for Now.” During the meal, Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God” (Mark 14:25). Matthew tells us something more in his version of this account. There, Jesus says He’ll be sharing the wine “with you” (Matthew 26:29). There will be another dinner, another feast where Jesus will be gathered with His disciples once again. But this one will not be a last meal before suffering and sadness. This meal will be a celebration of joy. The apostle John caught a glimpse of this future, nothing-like-it-ever-before party. In a vision, he saw a marriage celebration, a time of joy for the Lord and His people at the end of history (Revelation 19:6–9).\n\nThe Last Supper that Jesus spent with His disciples before His arrest wasn’t exactly an upbeat affair: Judas left early to finalize his plans to betray Jesus (John 13:21–30); Jesus told Peter he would deny Him three times that very night (Mark 14:30); and Jesus clued the remaining disciples in on how, centuries earlier, Zechariah had predicted they’d all abandon Him in His moment of need (Mark 14:27). Of course, it was Jesus who bore the brunt of sadness, knowing that in just a matter of hours He would be arrested, tried, and falsely convicted. The next day, He would be tortured before being nailed to a tree for the sins of humanity. It all hung like a shadow over the upper room. Yet, it was Jesus who told His friends, “You will become sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn to joy” (John 16:20).\n\nWe are sheep made of the same stuff as Jesus’s first disciples. We scatter pretty easily too. That’s why, after Jesus passed around His cup of wine at the Last Supper for Now, He spoke of a new covenant (Mark 14:24), the mention of which would have surely conjured up memories of God’s words to Jeremiah in the minds of His disciples: “‘Instead, this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days’—the LORD’s declaration. ‘I will put my teaching within them and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people’” (Jeremiah 31:33).\n\nAs we step closer to Good Friday, let’s look to Golgotha, that hill where He was crucified. It was there that Jesus’s blood was poured out so that we could be brought near to God through the new covenant. That’s why, even as we mourn our sin, recognizing that it was our rebellion that nailed Jesus to the cross, we have reason for joy: we have a wedding feast to prepare for. We’ve been invited to the party of parties, one we’ll talk about for ages and ages to come. And we’ll be there, not because of anything we have done, but because Jesus is the Good Shepherd who willingly lays down His for His sheep, even the ones who wander off when the pressure is on.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    These past few weeks have changed the way I look at the world. While my wife and I have always considered ourselves amateur preppers, we weren’t expecting the speed with which a virus could wing its way around the world and affect our everyday lives.\n\nWhen we were building a deep pantry with plenty of shelf-stable breakfast foods and slowly buying enough batteries to power a small village for a weekend, we were trying to be ready, just in case we lost electricity for a few days or an ice storm in wintertime left us unable to leave our neighborhood. But we can never plan for everything that comes our way, as these last few weeks have made clear.\n\nThere are some things we can plan for, and there are some for which we cannot. And then there are those times when we inadvertently plan for something we didn’t see coming. Mary of Bethany loved Jesus, but she didn’t know that in just a few days His lifeless body would be wrapped and buried in a garden tomb. When she grabbed that alabaster jar and broke it, she was acting out of love and devotion; she wasn’t thinking about a funeral. When she poured the perfume of nard over Jesus’s head, she must have breathed in the heavy fragrance, a scent normally reserved for nobility and the wealthy. She wasn’t aware that Jesus would soon be “crowned” King of the Jews with an arrangement of cruel thorns and a faded purple robe borrowed from a Roman soldier.\n\nMary’s heart was undivided. That perfume poured out in extravagance might as well have been her own life. She loved Jesus. But without realizing it, she was also taking part in the most important event in all of human history. Jesus said, “She has done what she could; she has anointed my body in advance for burial. Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her” (Mark 14:8–9).\n\nWe can’t plan for everything, but here’s what we can plan for: the kingdom of God advancing. Someday it will be said, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign forever and ever” (Revelation 11:15). This is the future. This is certain. Therefore, it is never a mistake to pour ourselves out for the Lord, never a waste to give Him everything we have. Mary may have looked like the fanatic that day at Simon the Leper’s home, but in reality, she was the only one who understood the times, even if she didn’t know precisely what was coming.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    I’ve never been to the land of Israel. But the trip is on my list, and given what I am blessed to do for a living, it’s important to me. So, for now, I haven’t stood on the Mount of Olives or dipped my toes in the Sea of Galilee. And I’ve never been to the Western Wall, that last vestige of the once grand temple complex that’s become the holiest site on earth for many Jewish people. But one day I hope to, and when I do, I imagine I won’t be able to stop myself from weeping. I’ll close my eyes, stretch out my hand, and touch a bit of redemption history—so near to the place where God’s glorious presence once dwelled with His people, the spot where heaven touched earth so long ago.\n\nThe Western Wall isn’t just a reminder of what has been. It’s also a testimony to what God is still doing. At a moment when Jesus’s disciples were beginning to think Jesus would step forward as the Messiah and the rightful King of Israel to send the Roman legions limping back to Italy, Jesus made a startling declaration about the temple: “These things that you see—the days will come when not one stone will be left on another that will not be thrown down” (Luke 21:6). The temple would fall, just as it had in the days of Jeremiah. In a passage that appears to place an imminent military attack within the shadows of the end of the world, Jesus’s words must have shook His disciples to their core or, at the very least, confused them a great deal. Destruction was coming soon, not triumph, at least not triumph in the way Jesus’s friends were thinking.\n\nWithin a generation, the Roman general Titus surrounded Jerusalem, laid siege to the city, and demolished the temple. Jesus’s words came true: “When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that its desolation has come near…. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all things take place” (Luke 21:20, 32). No wonder the Lord wept when He saw the city earlier that week (Luke 19:41).\n\nThere is a first-century monument in Rome commemorating the destruction of Jerusalem, that moment of supposed victory for the empire. Just a few feet from the famous Colosseum, the Arch of Titus stands. It depicts conquered Jewish slaves and the treasures of the temple being led in procession from the holy land. I have stood beneath the arch and seen this relief, carved in white marble like some ancient photograph. I couldn’t stop the tears from welling up.\n\nA few days after Jesus prophesied about the destruction of the temple, He was beaten and bloodied. The Romans were not in retreat, but were instead nailing the true King of Israel to a cross. By outward appearances, all hope was lost. But in reality, Jesus’s death was a triumph—over sin, the curse that infects this world, the powers of darkness, and death itself. He died so that His people—and people from every nation, including Rome—could have eternal life. The temple no longer stands in Jerusalem, but something better exists in its place. Jesus died so that God’s glorious presence would dwell not in a building made by human hands but within every person who places their trust in the Son of God.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    God loves sinners. And sometimes, if we’re honest, it can be downright annoying. Jesus died so that the worst of the worst could be saved. That includes our least favorite people—the ones who have hurt us, the ones who are still hurting us, and the ones we’re afraid of. If we were assigned the task of doling out grace, these folks would not be on our list. But God’s mercy is bigger than our moral outrage, and it exposes places deep within us where we’re still savoring the forbidden fruit of the garden, clinging to the lie of the enemy: “You will be like God, knowing good and evil” (Genesis 3:5). We believe we know best, and our compass is made up of the big and small offenses we carry around with us.\n\nWe’re not the first to do this though. In Jesus’s day, the Jewish religious leaders had their own way of putting themselves in the place of God. They wanted to limit access to the kindness of the Lord, believing their enemies were God’s as well. But then Jesus showed up in the temple complex.\n\nThe Old Testament prophets spoke of a time when God’s people would not just be the people of Israel. Men and women would come from all over the world to worship the world’s true King. Malachi recorded, “‘My name will be great among the nations, from the rising of the sun to its setting. Incense and pure offerings will be presented in my name in every place because my name will be great among the nations,’ says the LORD of Armies” (Malachi 1:11). And Isaiah wrote, “In the last days the mountain of the LORD’s house will be established at the top of the mountains and will be raised above the hills. All nations will stream to it” (Isaiah 2:2).\n\nBut the Jewish leaders of Jesus’s day were not so excited about this prospect. These nations, one after another, had not been so kind to them—the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks, Syrians, and now the Romans (to name a few) had trampled over the people of God for as long as they could remember. No one was eager to roll out the red carpet for these folks. So the people in power promptly ignored what God had said. Naturally, Jesus had to remind them between snaps of His whip (see John 2:15 for that detail): “Is it not written, My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations?” (Mark 11:17; Isaiah 56:7).\n\nThe temple was made up of several sections, becoming more exclusive as one neared the Most Holy Place. The moneychangers and merchants who received the brunt of Jesus’s righteous anger had set up shop in the outer court, known as the Court of the Gentiles. This was the place where people from every nation on earth could come and worship the living God. In fact, it was the only place in the temple complex where they were permitted. In a cool bit of archaeology, two of the signs placed in the Court of the Gentiles from Jesus’s day have been discovered. The best preserved of the pair reads, “No alien may enter within the balustrade around the sanctuary and the enclosure. Whoever is caught, on himself shall he put blame for the death which will ensue.”\n\nThe religious leaders of His day were making the same stubborn, rebellious mistakes as their forefathers, pushing aside God and His vision for the world. That’s why Jesus quoted the book of Jeremiah, saying that they had made God’s temple “a den of robbers” (Mark 11:17; Jeremiah 7:11). Jesus lived with the kingdom of God always in view. He knew a day was coming when the dividing line between Jew and Gentile would be torn down and when people of every tribe, tongue, and nation would be citizens of that kingdom. His actions in cleansing the temple were prophetic. He was making room for the future that God was—and still is—bringing.\n\nWherever God has given us a voice and the agency to do so, let’s make room for the future. Let’s make our world a little bit more like the kingdom every chance we get.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n               ",

Jesus went up to Jerusalem. He had just been in Jericho, a city near the Dead Sea, the lowest spot on earth. The trek from there to Jerusalem would have seemed nearly vertical at times—a 3,370-foot rise in elevation over a distance of fourteen and a half miles—a hike not for the faint of heart.\n\nAs we enter the seventh week of our Lent study, it strikes me that our ascent from the depths of Judah’s exile in the book of Jeremiah to the heights of Holy Week in the Gospels is no less dramatic. It seems a drastic change for us in our reading, but for the people of Judah, the turning of the centuries had seemed to produce very little change. Sure, they were physically back in the promised land, no longer mourning on the banks of the Euphrates River. But they were not quite home yet. They were still ruled by a foreign power—first the Babylonians, then the Medes and the Persians, followed by the Greeks, and now the Romans. The exile that began in the book of Jeremiah had never really ended.\n\nJeremiah’s final scene has King Jehoiachin being released from prison in Babylon (Jeremiah 52:31), a glimmer of light at the close of a dark chapter in Judah’s history. A king in the line of David is still alive. There is still hope. God had promised that one of David’s descendants would sit on the throne, and that his kingdom would never end (2 Samuel 7:12–13). On Palm Sunday, as Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey, He fulfilled Zechariah’s prophecy about the coming of the Messianic King who would sit on David’s throne (Zechariah 9:9). Jesus is that King. He is the Son of David the people had been waiting for, the fulfillment of God’s promises—and the one to finally end Israel and Judah’s long exile.\n\nThe people recognized what Jesus was doing, putting Zechariah’s words into action. And they played their own parts, singing in response, “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord” (Luke 19:38; Psalm 118:26). But Jesus hadn’t come to topple the Romans. He had come to do battle with the true oppressor of God’s people, and for all people, everywhere: the spiritual forces of darkness (Colossians 2:15; 1John 3:8). He wasn’t there to set up a political kingdom, though one day the kingdom of this world will become the kingdom of God (Revelation 11:15). He wasn’t there to judge Israel’s enemies, but to take upon Himself the judgment for sin the world deserves (Isaiah 53:5; 1Peter 2:24). He was there to usher in the new covenant Jeremiah spoke about, when God promised, “I will forgive their iniquity and never again remember their sin” (Jeremiah 31:34).\n\nThe crowds were right to cheer the coming King, even if they didn’t quite understand His mission. They had no idea that His path would lead up another sharp hill, a hill called Golgotha. But for this moment, the misguided aspirations of the people intersected with God’s impossibly good plans so that Jesus received the praise due His name: Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord. Peace in heaven and glory in the highest heaven!” (Luke 19:38).\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n               ",

The reason it’s my favorite is because of the Shakespearean way it ends in tragedy. Han is betrayed by Lando and subsequently frozen in carbonite. The evil Emperor’s Imperial forces basically decimate the Rebel Alliance. Luke loses his hand to Vader after learning the Sith is his father, and he throws himself off a balcony in Cloud City into what appears to be a bottomless abyss. Every advantage the good guys possess seems to be erased by evil.\n\nBut then we see Luke, dangling from an antenna, telepathically calling to Leia to come get him. And though Luke doesn’t look like much at the time—defeated and diminished—we know the fight isn’t completely over yet. Hope hangs on, and that’s all we need in order to believe good will triumph in the end.\n\nThis last chapter of Jeremiah summarizes a lot of the book. What it shares in common with The Empire Strikes Back is that on almost every count, the destruction that befalls Judah is a catastrophe. Everything is destroyed. Enemy armies burned the city and broke down the walls. The civic infrastructure collapsed. Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, captured Judah’s king, Zedekiah, killed his children in front of him, and then gouged out his eyes. Nebuchadnezzar carried God’s people off into exile. The temple was destroyed, and intentionally defiled in the process. It’s a brutal scene. Is there any hope at all?\n\nYes. In the last four verses, like Luke clinging to that space antenna, hope hangs on. A tender shoot from the stump of Jesse pokes up through the ashes and rubble. Jehoiachin, languishing in Nebuchadnezzar’s dungeon, lives. He descends from the family of David, a king in the line of succession. God promised David that his throne would be established forever, and that the Messiah would come from his line (Jeremiah 23:1–8; 33:14–22). That promise holds, even when everything else seems to be ruined.\n\nIn Matthew’s genealogy, guess whose name appears in the lineage from Abraham to Christ? Jehoiachin’s (there spelled Jeconiah.) The line remained unbroken. David’s line survived, and thirteen generations later, Jesus was born to Mary and her husband Joseph, from the line of Jehoiachin.\n\nI imagine that only a few during Jeremiah’s time would have believed David’s line would survive, and from it the Messiah would come. But what the many or few believe doesn’t really matter. All that matters is what God promises to do. God’s promises do not fail. They cannot fail. He cannot be overcome.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n               ",

We headed to the northern coast near the Giant’s Causeway and hiked along the coastal cliffs, with the cerulean blue Irish Sea stretching out before us, and the faintest trace of Scotland lining the distant horizon across the water. Behind us were lush pastures of rolling hills framed by fieldstone walls, dotted with clusters of shaggy white sheep with their noses in the turf, contentedly chewing on soft wisps of the greenest grass I’d ever seen.\n\nIf you haven’t been to the place I’m talking about, you can imagine the beauty. You can look up pictures online. But what imagination and pictures can’t give you is the experience of the peace, the scent, the sound of the sea, the way it’s a world in motion—waves rolling, grass dancing on the breeze, sheep grazing.\n\nIf you have been there, I bet my description makes you want to go back, doesn’t it? Going to places like this awakens in us an ache for that sort of beauty and peace to be permanent. And we were created to long for beauty and peace to be permanent.\n\nThe language the Lord uses in Jeremiah 50 to talk about His people’s return—not only to their land, but to a place of peace—mentions some specific locations that would have been not only familiar to the people of Israel and Judah, but also places of affection and beauty. These were places of prosperity, hospitality, peace, and beauty. The pastures of Carmel. The hills of Ephraim. The Lord would bring them back to a place that resides in their hearts as much as on their maps.\n\n“I will return Israel to his grazing land, and he will feed on Carmel and Bashan” (Jeremiah 50:19).\n\nThe restoration mentioned in verse 19 refers to more than the land of Judah and Israel. It refers to future glory. It will be devoid of all iniquity; sin will be sought but not found. It’s a picture of a perfect pasture and a perfected people. This is what awaits the remnant of the Lord. They will stand in those beloved places, in the best possible conditions, in perfect spiritual and relational health. That’s what’s coming for the people of God.\n\nWhen I stood on the Irish coast with my son, I felt an ache, knowing that I would have to leave. And I felt a resolve to one day return, even though I was still there and would be for a few more days. Something good and true, something glorious, something aching for perfect peace awoke in me. Later this year I will return, and I can’t wait. I’m sure I’ll feel the same ache when I leave, and the same resolve to return.\n\nWhen the Lord talks about our future restoration, He blows right past all the temporal stuff we know now, with all its turmoil and imperfection, and gives us a picture of perfect, eternal peace. We ache for it. Something in us knows we were meant to be there. And the promise is that one day, because of Jesus, we will. And we’ll never have to leave.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n               ",

The Elam kids were known to be a tough bunch. The stories people told about the Elam boys, who were a few grades ahead of me, were terrifying. They picked a lot of fights. They said lots of bad things about other kids’ mothers. They were the town bullies. For most kids, a sense of dread came over us at the mention of their name. The thought of running into them on a Friday night made our blood run cold.\n\nThere was an Elam boy in my grade. Early on, I stayed out of his way. I didn’t want any part of what I knew the Elams dished out. But over time, I discovered that the Elam in my class was actually a kind kid, someone I even came to regard as my friend. I had lumped them all together, but they weren’t all the same.\n\nJeremiah 49 ends with two main messages to the nation of Elam. First, God tells them that He is going to break them and scatter them. The language God uses is chilling and comprehensive. His judgment against them will be severe. But the second thing He says is this:\n\n“Yet, in the last days, I will restore the fortunes of Elam. This is the LORD’s declaration” (v.39).\n\nIn other words, the Elam of Jeremiah’s day, a nation at war against the Lord and His people, will not be the only Elam history remembers. Restoration will come. Just as not every Elam boy in my town deserved the reputation the older brothers earned for themselves, not every Elamite in Scripture will be remembered as God’s enemy.\n\nWhere do we see the prophecy of God restoring the fortunes of Elam fulfilled? We see it at Pentecost in Acts 2, where the nations gather and God pours out His Holy Spirit on them all. We then see it in the spread of the New Testament church, where people from every tongue, tribe, and nation are welcomed into the Body of Christ as full heirs of God’s kingdom, by grace through faith in Jesus. We see it even further in the way Paul labors in his letter to the Galatians to emphasize that there is no distinction in God’s eyes between Jew and Gentile, but all are one in Christ. The fortune the Lord restores to the descendants of Elam is nothing short of the kingdom of God itself.\n\nThe truth is, God’s Church is made up of people who descend from either Gentile nations who once opposed God, or Israel, His covenant people who were rebellious and stiff-necked in His presence. Every one of us descends from a line of people who have a reputation for fighting with God. But He has a reputation of preserving a remnant. If we are in Christ, we are part of that remnant. That any of us would be counted among His own is a sign of His great mercy and grace.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n               ",

And if we do tend to believe struggle is a sign of God’s absence, then what are we saying we believe about God?\n\nThe fates of nations converge in these chapters from Jeremiah. Egypt. Babylon. Israel. The Philistines. Moab. In an ominous declaration, the Lord tells His people that He will bring an end to all those other nations, but not to Israel (Jeremiah 46:28). And here again we are reminded that the Lord rules over all the earth—not just Israel, but every other nation too.\n\nSometimes it is difficult to look at the world as it is—with all its political division, international turmoil, financial unrest, threats of pandemic disease—and believe that anyone has any control over anything. When we are in the middle of difficult circumstances ourselves, we often feel as though whatever plan the Lord might have, it’s temporarily on hold.\n\nWhen we read the Lord’s Word about how He will deal with those nations who oppose Him, we see a God who speaks as though He remains in control over the entire cosmos. There is not one word of weakness or uncertainty in God’s declaration of what He will do. Not one. All we have are words of strength.\n\nHe is strong when we are not. He is in control when we are disoriented, discouraged, and on the verge of defeat. He is resolute when we are racked with uncertainty. He is fierce when we are depleted. He has a view of eternity when we cannot see what will come in the next seven minutes.\n\nSometimes we go through hard seasons for reasons we will never fully comprehend. Sometimes we will have hard times because of God’s loving and disciplining hand. Sometimes we will get caught in the switches of living in a broken world, and things will fall apart in ways that will leave us devastated. In all these moments, God is strong, at work, and faithful. And there is no king, pandemic, financial collapse, military conflict, or natural disaster that can wrest power from His hand.\n\nWe may not always understand this. We may not always like it. But we can rest in it.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    “Remember, wherever you go, you go too.”\n\nI heard an old friend give this advice many times. The simple idea here is that we think we can run away from our problems, but it is often the case that we are, in some measure, their source. Even if we pack up and move across the country because where we live seems unbearably difficult, the one thing we take with us, no matter where we land, is ourselves.\n\nIn these chapters of Jeremiah, God’s people are called to “hear the word of the LORD” that they might repent, because His judgment is underway (Jeremiah 44:24). Some of the people of Israel, in an effort to escape God’s disciplining hand, moved to Egypt. He may ask, “Why are you doing such terrible harm to yourselves?” (v.7), but in truth, God not only knows where they are and what they are doing, He also knows what lurks within their hearts: their idolatry, their refusal to obey the Lord, and their desire to worship foreign, false gods they had to search out to find. But the Lord called them, as He calls all of us, to own the ways they’ve sought to distance themselves from Him.\n\nOwn it.\nName it.\nRepent of it.\nReturn.\n\nWhat ways do you seek to hide yourself from God? What are the ways you seek to position yourself so you’re nowhere near the consequences of your unkindness, or dishonesty, or misplaced worship? Some in Israel fled to Egypt, but the rebellious, idolatrous hearts beating away in their chests went with them. And until they dealt with the truth of who they were and who God had called them to be, they would never be free of the treachery that got them into all this trouble in the first place.\n\nHere’s the beauty of God’s call to the rebellious idolater: it comes with an invitation to repent and the promise that He is a God who keeps His promises and does not discard His people.\n\nBeing honest, I try to distance myself from my own dark desires and behaviors by moving things around so others won’t suspect I struggle in the ways I do. Do you do this? How? Sometimes it’s as simple as spinning the truth a little so that things reflect well on you. Other times, it’s as elaborate as selling your house and moving away. But we all do this in some measure, don’t we?\n\nOne thing Scripture makes abundantly clear is this: We cannot outrun our sinful hearts on our own. We need to be delivered. In Jeremiah, as Israel and Judah lie in ruin, and as the people wonder what hope remains, the presence and word of the Lord remains, calling them back and promising redemption. And this is precisely what Christ has done for us. So just as you always take yourself with you wherever you go, when your faith is in Christ, you take Him too.\n\nNo matter where you go, you are fully seen and fully known by God. But more importantly, you are also fully loved.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    For as far back as I can remember, Christians have been saying things like, “This is the greatest challenge the Church has ever faced in our lifetime”—or something to that effect. This rings true even more loudly these days, as many churches across the world have decided to forego in-person fellowship as a way to love their neighbors in light of the ongoing coronavirus threat. But beyond disease prevention that disrupts our normal services, we have a real enemy whose desire is to persecute and destroy the Church.\n\nWhile we are right to acknowledge the intentions of our enemy and be realistic about the possibility of persecution, our hand-wringing about every challenge we face often betrays a lack of faith. Those of us who trust in Christ will face difficulties, persecution, and more, but God is with us, and these trials will not destroy us.\n\nJeremiah met with the remnant of God’s people who were still in Jerusalem after its defeat by the Babylonians. They came to him so that he might ask the Lord what they should do: stay in Israel or go to another land? They promised to obey whatever the Lord told them to do, and Jeremiah responded by waiting on a word from the Lord. Ten days later, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, and He said:\n\n“If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will rebuild and not demolish you, and I will plant and not uproot you, because I relent concerning the disaster that I have brought on you. Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon… I will grant you compassion, and he will have compassion on you and allow you to return to your own soil” (Jeremiah 42:10–12). \n\nThe Lord held out hope to His people in the midst of coming trouble. We, too, have hope in Christ, no matter what comes. In Romans 8, we’re given a realistic picture of the life that a Christian can expect to experience in this world, things like affliction and distress, persecution and famine, nakedness and danger (Romans 8:35). However, we do not encounter our trials as passive victims who are being trampled by the enemy, because nothing can separate us from the love of Christ. And “if God is for us, who is against us?” (vv.38–39,31).\n\nThe people of Jeremiah’s day rejected God’s comfort and provision. They decided they would rather flee to Egypt than trust the God who loved them. Their pain, rather than being mitigated, was actually multiplied. Regardless, God’s purposes still stood. God still brought the people of Judah back into the land when the time came. And centuries later, one of the descendants of one of those exiled was Jesus. God’s plans cannot be thwarted, no matter what the enemy has planned.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    For those of us who are married, we can remember the days of looking for an engagement ring for our brides. Men like me cluelessly stumbled into a jewelry store hoping to find the perfect ring, only to receive a lecture about “the four C’s”: color, clarity, carat, and cut. Afterward, we would be shown what seems like countless options. There, with the bright lights of the jewelry store’s lights, set against the dark velvet backdrop of the showcase, the colors of the diamonds would shine with exquisite brightness. Each turn of the diamond showed off another facet of the stone and beautiful new rays of light.\n\nIn the same way, the more we meditate on who God is, the more we learn about His true nature: we discover the beautiful wonders of His grace, mercy, and love toward us. However, these things shine even brighter when set against the dark backdrop of God’s unflinching justice. When we consider just how heinous our sin really is, the fact that He moves toward us in grace and mercy to bring us back into relationship with Him becomes even more amazing.\n\nThe fall of Jerusalem reminds us of this important, but frightening, truth: God keeps all of His promises, including those that threaten negative consequences for sinful behavior. Today’s reading recounts how Jeremiah was freed so that he might stay in Jerusalem. The captain of the guards released the prophet, and in doing so, he revealed what he knew of Jeremiah’s message before the fall of Jerusalem.\n\nThe captain of the guards took Jeremiah and said to him, \n“The LORD your God decreed this disaster on this place, \nand the Lord has fulfilled it. He has done just what he decreed. \nBecause you people have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed him, \nthis thing has happened” (Jeremiah 40:2–3).\n\nThe captain understood that the Lord had warned them what would happen if they did not repent of their unfaithfulness to Him, and he had seen the Lord follow through on that promise. God’s faithfulness to keep His promises is wonderful, always. It is no less wonderful when it isn’t what we wanted because of our disobedience. In Romans, the apostle Paul contrasted the grim consequences of our sin with the beauty of Christ’s gospel, saying, “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).\n\nThere is not one man reading this who has not sinned. Left to ourselves, we have all earned the wages of our sin, but because God is rich in mercy and loves us, He sent His Son into the world (Ephesians 2:4). Not by our good works or by our religious perfection, but through God’s own grace, He gives us the gift of eternal life in Jesus Christ. In Christ, though we were once dead, now we are alive. In Him, though we once had no hope, now we live in the hope that we will forever reign with Him.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    On the morning of May 31, 1889, the city of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, lay in dire peril, but they did not know it yet. Between six and ten inches of rain had fallen in the previous twenty-four hours, and the South Fork Dam, weakened by alterations made by a hunting-and-fishing club, looked as if it might give way. The president of the club had a nearby telegraph office send a message to Johnstown. It read: “Southfork Dam liable to break. Notify the people to prepare for the worst.” The Johnstown telegraph office had received warnings like this before that hadn’t resulted in problems, so they ignored it. At about 1:30 p.m., the dam gave way and 2,208 people perished in the roaring flood waters.\n\nLike the men in the telegraph office, God often calls on His people to warn their friends, neighbors, and family of impending danger. One of the images the Bible uses to demonstrate this responsibility is the watchman standing on the wall (Ezekiel 3:17). When he spots danger, he must warn the people. He cannot control what their response will be, but he must issue the warning nonetheless.\n\nThe prophet Jeremiah played the role of watchman in Jeremiah 37–38. The Babylonians were waiting at the door, ready to vanquish the city of Jerusalem. The tense scene between Jeremiah and Zedekiah shows the prophet’s willingness to say hard words to someone who needed to hear them. He told the king that if he surrendered, he would live and his household would survive. However, if he refused to surrender, the city would burn and he would not escape the inferno.\n\nJeremiah pressed Zedekiah to listen: “Obey the LORD in what I am telling you, so it may go well for you and you can live” (Jeremiah 38:20). Jeremiah was charged with speaking God’s words, but he could not control the outcome.\n\nOur calling is not the same as Jeremiah’s, but as followers of Jesus, we are surrounded by friends, family, and neighbors who recklessly live their lives as if God does not exist. They are setting themselves up for misery, not only in this life, but also in the life to come. As ambassadors for Christ, we have been given a message—the gospel—and we are responsible for sharing it with the world, so that those we meet may be reconciled to God and live in the hope and joy that comes from knowing Him. We cannot make our friends believe, nor can we exercise faith for our family and neighbors, but we can tell them the truth of the gospel so that they may believe. As the apostle Paul told the church in Rome, “How can they believe without hearing about him? And how can they hear without a preacher?” (Romans 10:14).\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    The Bible does far more than merely teach us how to live; it points to Jesus, who came to rescue us from our sin and shame, changing the lives of everyone who believes in Him. Scripture also provides us with examples to follow, as well as avoid. In 1 Corinthians 10, the apostle Paul points to the Israelites’ wandering in the wilderness, telling the wayward Corinthian church that “these things took place as examples for us, so that we will not desire evil things as [the Israelites] did” (v.6).\n\nWhile Paul provided the Corinthian church with an example to avoid, today’s reading in Jeremiah shows an example of faithfulness that all of God’s people ought to emulate. Jeremiah lived in a faithless generation. The people’s sin against the Lord invited the Lord’s retribution, and the consequences of their sin now stood at their doorstep in the form of the Babylonian army. The Lord chose a people that we know little about, the Rechabites, to show Israel what it means to be faithful to Him.\n\nThe Lord told Jeremiah to go to the Rechabites and invite them to the temple for a drink of wine, which Jeremiah did. The Rechabites refused the wine, however, explaining that their ancestor Jonadab had told them that they were to never drink wine. They had remained faithful to the command and lived as he said they should live.\n\nThe Lord held the Rechabites’ obedience up as an example, because they had kept the word of their ancestor, Jonadab. But Israel and Judah refused to keep God’s word over and over again. God wanted His people to see the Rechabites’ lifetime of faithful obedience to what had been passed down to them. The Lord spoke in terms that echoed His promise to David (2 Samuel 7), declaring that the Rechabites would endure and that someone from their family would “stand before [Him] always” (Jeremiah 35:19)\n\nThe Lord calls His people to faithfulness, and this passage shows us the type of faithfulness He desires. He wants us to hear His Word, read His Word, take His Word to heart, and to obey His Word, not out of a sense of duty but of gladness. As we follow Him faithfully, the Holy Spirit develops the character of Christ in us, and we grow in love for Him and for the people around us. Just as He rewarded the Rechabites for their faithfulness, He desires to reward us as well. Those who walk in glad obedience to Christ experience the joy of knowing Him, and live with the hope of eternal life, which His Son’s perfect faithfulness purchased for us.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    “Have you prayed about it?”\n\nMy friend’s words were not unfamiliar. I was walking through a dark night of the soul, and he was offering the counsel I had already heard from several people. I mumbled, “Of course I’ve been praying about it.” This dear friend forcefully placed his hand on my shoulder and asked, “No, have you prayed about it?” His inquiry made an important point: there is a difference between mumbling a few words in prayer, in going through the motions, and actually praying as if God hears us when we pray.\n\nOur boldness in prayer is inextricably linked with our knowledge that God knows us, loves us, and hears us. Today’s readings provide a powerful reminder that all three of these things are true. Jeremiah 33 shows God’s people in great difficulty; Jerusalem is besieged on all sides by the Babylonian army. Through Jeremiah, the Lord invites His people to call on Him that He might “answer [them] and tell [them] great and incomprehensible things [they did] not know” (Jeremiah 33:3). This is a summons, an invitation to cry out to the Lord and discover those “things” that are unsearchable and beyond the grasp of finite human wisdom.\n\nThe Lord showed Jeremiah a vision of a future in which God’s people live at peace with Him because He will keep the promises that He made to King David. Though the city of Jerusalem was under siege and about to be defeated, the Lord told Jeremiah that He would restore the fortunes of the city and rebuild it. He would forgive the iniquity that caused the disasters, and the city’s restoration would be proclaimed throughout all the earth. Because of His grace and mercy, every bit of damage done by the Babylonians would one day be undone by God. Judah could be sustained in their disastrous present, knowing that God would usher in a glorious future.\n\nThose of us who stand on the other side of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ inherit these precious promises, for those of us who have faith in Christ have been adopted as God’s own children. And one day, we will reign forever with God’s Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, in a kingdom that will never end (Romans 8:16–17).\n\nOne implication of both God’s adoption of us and His promises to us is that He invites us to pray to Him. Just as He told Jeremiah to call on Him and see “incomprehensible things,” He invites us to call on Him and receive incomprehensible blessings. He beckons us to come boldly to the throne of grace when we are weak, so that we might find help in our time of need, finding strength through Him, even in our weakest moments (Hebrews 4:16; 2 Corinthians 12:9–11). He commands us to no longer be burdened by our anxieties, but instead to bring them to Him so that we might experience His peace (Matthew 11:28–30). Because He loves us, He keeps His promises and gives us hope. When we finally do seek Him, we find that He is all we’ve ever needed.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n               ",

There’s The Natural and Bull Durham, but my favorite? Field of Dreams—that story of an Iowa farmer named Ray Kinsella (played by Kevin Costner) who starts hearing a voice in his cornfield: “If you build it, he will come.” Ray interprets this to mean he’s supposed to build a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield, which he does, much to the ridicule of some relatives and most of the townspeople. It’s a completely nonsensical decision that Ray decides to follow through with anyway. He trusts the voice.\n\nOf course, the corker is that while Ray at first thinks it’s all about giving Shoeless Joe Jackson another chance to play ball, what Ray finally discovers is that it’s actually about healing the wound between him and his dad. As Ray and his dad “have a catch,” the sun sets gently on that Iowa cornfield/baseball field, and at least for a moment, all’s right with the world.\n\nRoll credits.\n\nThe prophet Jeremiah had a “field of dreams” moment, of sorts. But instead of being situated in the middle of Iowa, his field was in Anathoth. The voice of the Lord came to Jeremiah and told him that a cousin would offer to sell the field and that Jeremiah was to buy it. At the time, with Jerusalem under siege and Jeremiah in prison, the purchase of that field was, seemingly, quite the nonsensical act. However, the voice behind it all wasn’t some ghostly cinematic whisper. The voice Jeremiah heard was the voice of the Lord. And he trusted the voice: “Oh, Lord GOD! You yourself made the heavens and earth by your great power and with your outstretched arm” (Jeremiah 32:17).\n\nThe field in Anathoth represented the redemption and restoration that God had planned for His people, that after all the heartache and hardship of their captivity, He would bring them home and make an everlasting covenant with them where they would be His people and He would be their God. Essentially, Jeremiah heard God say, “Buy the field, and watch what wonders I will do.” So, for seventeen shekels of silver, Jeremiah did just that, trusting in the great power of God’s outstretched arm to indeed bring good from disaster, restore their fortunes, and bring them home to a place of safety and promise.\n\nIt would be like a dream come true. The wound between the people and the Father would be healed. And at least for a time, God’s people would seek His face and worship Him.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n               ",

After the soldiers arrive on the scene to cheers and tears, and hugs and kisses—well, in a matter of seconds, I get a little misty-eyed. Every single time.\n\nRegardless of your feelings/opinions/thoughts about the military and war or even rumors of war, those reunions are heart-wrenching. If you’re not moved by them, even a little, you might want to get a check-up, because the odds are good something’s a bit off. Just the idea of those we dearly love being in harm’s way and then returning home, safe and sound, should stir something within us. Such homecomings are inevitably marked by joy.\n\nAnd joy is exactly the word Jeremiah used to describe the exiles’ return from captivity: “They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will be radiant with joy” (Jeremiah 31:12). Yet here’s the thing with joy when it comes to God’s people returning home: their joy would not have been anywhere near as joyous had there not been significant hardship preceding it. For God’s people, there was horrible darkness before the light, heartbreaking gloom before the brightness. Weeping and mourning, moaning and grief, lament and bitterness, ashamed and humiliated, terror and trouble, pain and guilt—these are the words Jeremiah used to describe their captivity.\n\nSuch stories are wise reminders for those of us who claim the name of “Christian.” One of the words that should describe our lives is joy, but that joy doesn’t reflect a hardship-free life by any means. Our lives are in no way exempt from the harm and heartache common to all men, women, and children. The difference is the way we live in light of that reality. It was the way that God’s people, even in the midst of all their trouble, were called to live while in captivity: with hope. That hope in God and His promises is what set the stage for the looks on their faces as they made their way back home, radiantly marked with joy.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Open letters. They’ve enjoyed a long history in our culture, but with the advent of social media they’re experiencing an almost golden age. Not sure what they are? Trust me, you’ve seen them. The goal with an open letter is that it be read by a large group of people, even if it is at times addressed only to one. An open letter brings the public’s attention to a problem or situation they may or may not be aware of previously.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” is a notable, historical example, beginning with, “My Dear Fellow Clergymen.” Other less weighty, but nonetheless popular, open letters have begun with, “An Open Letter to the Woman Who Sold Us a Sick Dog” and “To the employee at the Panera in Augusta, Maine, who attempted to Mom-Shame me because my four-year-old had a tantrum.” Obviously, those last two examples were addressed to one individual, but meant to be read by tons of people.\n\nWhile it may not come as quickly to mind, another historical example begins with, “To All the Exiles I Deported from Jerusalem to Babylon” (Jeremiah 29:4). That’s God’s letter via Jeremiah, addressed to the rest of the exiles, priests, prophets, and all the people King Nebuchadnezzar had deported from Jerusalem to Babylon. Those recipients had been uprooted from their homes and found themselves in a foreign land indifferent to, if not hostile toward, the worship of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. What were the people to do? How were they to live?\n\nGod’s answer, through Jeremiah, no doubt surprised them. “Build houses and live in them. Plant gardens and eat their produce. Take wives and have sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons and give your daughters to men in marriage so that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there; do not decrease” (Jeremiah 29:5–6). In short: “Pursue the well-being of the city I have deported you to” (v.7).\n\nRestoration was on the horizon for God’s people, from their fortunes to their homeland, but not until a significant amount of time had passed (seventy years). Perhaps anticipating their potential “woe is us” mentality, wringing their hands and hiding out in caves over their newfound reality, God essentially says to them, “Settle down here, and live life among these people. I have not forgotten you. Don’t you forget about Me.”\n\nThe people were to hold fast to their identity as God’s chosen, to search and seek Him with all their hearts (v.13), while putting down roots in a foreign land. Does anything sound even remotely familiar there? Could it be that we, you and I, are part of that larger intended audience? Is there wisdom for us, too, within God’s open letter to His people from so long ago?\n\nIt seems the answer is yes.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Baseball legend Casey Stengel once insisted that we should “never make predictions, especially about the future.” But we do, don’t we? Human history brims with such things. And in our world right now, when the religious and political and social and economic turmoil and division seem to have reached a fevered pitch, we’re constantly 24/7 aware of it; the “prophetic” voices are blaringly loud with their predictions as to what will come to pass.\n\nAbout a decade ago, a man by the name of Harold Camp made the prediction (“prophesied”) that the world would begin its ending on May 21, 2011, the day when all true Christians would be snatched away and rapturously transported to heaven. Everyone else, unfortunately, would be left to suffer an apocalyptic, end-of-the-world scenario with the same world completely ending on October 21st of that same year. Now, unless we’re all stuck in some sort of a weird dream, Camp’s prophecy did not come true. In other words, Camp is known as a “false” prophet, among other things.\n\nThere was the yoke of Babylon, prophesied by Jeremiah, which involved war and disaster and plague. And then there was the joke of Babylon, which ended up being the prophet Hananiah who predicted something entirely different and much more pleasant to the human ear: peace (Jeremiah 28:1–4). But here’s the deal when it comes to prophecies of peace: “Only when the word of the prophet comes true will the prophet be recognized as one the LORD has truly sent” (v.9). Jeremiah said as much in the presence of all the priests and all the people, and Hananiah. Everyone hoped for peace, including Jeremiah (v.6), yet such predictions are only validated once the peace comes, not before. In other words, Hananiah turned out to be a false prophet.\n\nIn days like the ones we’re living in right now, days full of supposed prophetic voices to the right and to the left of us, it’s wise to practice a little—okay, a lot—of biblical discernment. We all want peace, but we need to beware of premature and misguided hopes. Before we attribute the word “prophet” to anyone, their predictions must be measured against God’s Word and the truths found therein. That is the only way to distinguish between a prophet the Lord has truly sent—and a joke.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    “The best defense is a good offense.”\n\nWho said that? Well, that quote’s been attributed to the likes of everyone from first U.S. President George Washington to famous Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi, and also to voices you’ve probably heard of but don’t know too much about, like Machiavelli and Sun Tzu. In other words, a lot of people have said this or something similar. And although quite concise as it is, it’s possible to whittle this phrase down just a bit further to: be proactive. When it comes to strategy, be it military, gaming, or business, a passive stance leaves you vulnerable. So, take the initiative.\n\nA variation on this theme, with regard to street fighting, is found is Norman Maclean’s classic A River Runs Through It. Now, I’m not advocating street fighting, or any fighting for that matter, but should you for some reason find yourself in such a scenario, it might pay to remember this: “If it looks like a fight is coming, get in the first punch.” Take the initiative.\n\nJeremiah calls God’s people to do the same, to respond sooner rather than later, and heed the Lord’s warnings: “So now, correct your ways and deeds, and obey the LORD your God so that he might relent concerning the disaster he had pronounced against you” (Jeremiah 26:13).\n\nAfter Jeremiah speaks hard words to the people, he tells them, “As for me, here I am in your hands; do to me what you think is good and right” (v.14). At first glance that appears to be a rather passive defense. But if we go back a bit earlier, we’ll see that Jeremiah got in the first punch, so to speak, meaning he prefaced everything he was saying and left no doubt as to whom was really doing the talking that day: “This is what the LORD says” and “the LORD sent me” (vv.2,12). In fact, throughout the entire address, Jeremiah kept taking the initiative by reminding the people that “the LORD” had sent him. The prophet didn’t stop there; he kept on pushing, not letting up because the message God had sent to the people was just too important.\n\nWe’d be wise to adopt such a strategy. No, not for the purposes of street fighting, but definitely in our wrestling “not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this darkness, against evil, spiritual forces in the heavens” (Ephesians 6:12).\n\nAs we live day in and day out in a world that often seems at odds with God, we must be proactive, taking the initiative and placing not only our words but also our actions under the umbrella of what “the LORD says” and has called us to do. And how to start doing that? A daily practice of reading God’s Word. Remember, it’s not if a fight is coming, but rather when it comes. Be ready with a good offense by aligning your life with God’s will and His Word. Always strive to get in the first punch. And keep punching.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    We had told my daughter not to play around with the eighty-dollar foam insert from her baby brother’s car seat. As her mother and I cleaned the car seat we realized her playful chirps and hums had gone rather quiet. Around the corner in the living room, there was my young daughter—with pieces of the foam insert spread around the room. After sending her to her room, my wife and I had to discuss the “D” word: discipline.\n\nGod’s attribute of wrath is not one that gets too much playtime in our culture. It seems rather contrarian to talk about a God of love and at the same time consider that God is also just. His wrath is not the capricious, spur-of-the-moment anger that often overtakes us at our frustration over the smallest of things. Instead, God’s wrath is the rightful display and action of His anger against sin, which is the desecration of His glory.\n\nHere in Jeremiah’s prophecies, we find God proclaiming that the day of His wrath is coming. Lest we think that God is just a cranky old ogre, He tells us of His persistence to warn Israel from their infidelity: “The LORD sent all his servants the prophets to you time and time again, but you have not obeyed or even paid attention. He announced, ‘Turn, each of you, from your evil way of life and from your evil deeds. Live in the land the LORD gave to you and your ancestors long ago and forever’” (Jeremiah 25:4–5). But like children with their fingers in their ears refusing to obey their parents’ warnings, so Israel refused to listen to God.\n\nA visual image is given to Jeremiah in the second section of this chapter: a cup of the wine of wrath. Symbolically, each nation would drink that cup. Each people group and power would be forced to reckon with the wrath of God because of their rebellion against Him. This chapter points to the deep reality that the Day of the Lord is coming, and He is coming with His vengeance and wrath against all sin. “The LORD brings a case against the nations. He enters into judgment with all people. As for the wicked, he hands them over to the sword—this is the LORD’s declaration” (v.31).\n\nAs I sat on the bed with my daughter, I told her that her disobedience made me sad. She had been warned not to play with the foam insert, and now it was broken and was expensive to replace. She asked how much it would cost to replace the insert, and after telling her, I watched as big tears of fear and sadness welled up in her eyes. “Daddy, I can’t pay that, I don’t have enough!” And the message of the gospel hit home to me at that moment. “Allison, I know, but I will repay it.”\n\nThe cost of our sin was so great that we could not repay it. But Jesus went to the cross on our behalf to drink the cup of the wrath of God on our behalf, so we would never have to taste the wrath of God. We lament our sin today but in faith trust the Savior who took the wrath of God in our place.\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    There is no question that we are living during a significant crisis of leadership today. The crisis doesn’t merely exist in our governmental systems or at the top levels of corporations throughout the globe. Our leadership crisis even extends to the Church. In this season of Lent, today would be a good day to pray for our leaders.\n\nThis problem existed in Jeremiah’s day as well. Jeremiah 23 begins with God pronouncing a “woe,” or curse, on the shepherds and false prophets of Israel who had poorly managed and led astray the people of God. The chapter moves us into God’s heavy word against the prophets and false teachers who were mishandling and manipulating God’s word for their own benefit. Instead of being faithful stewards of the Word of God, the prophets of Jeremiah’s day were living in adultery, walking in lies. Of their deception, God declared, “They strengthen the hands of evildoers, and none turns his back on evil (Jeremiah 23:14).” It’s an utter tragedy that things have come to this, that God would have to say, “I am against the prophets, who steal my words from one another” (v.30).\n\nOur tendency is to fix things when they are broken, to find a quick solution, even when there isn’t one. When we discover leadership that is spiritually inadequate and morally deficient we tend to just throw our allegiance onto another person; we find a different church, we turn to a different pastor, we expect another candidate to do better for us than the last one did. The sad reality is, our leaders—even those who fear God and strive to walk in His ways—will always disappoint us on some level. That’s why the hope of this passage takes us beyond looking for another spiritual leader who will do just a bit better than the last.\n\nJeremiah’s oracle directs us to put our hope not in the next human leader, but in the only true leader, the one true God who can make things right. God promises that one day He will raise up “a Righteous Branch” in the line of David (Jeremiah 23:5). The day is coming when we won’t live under the failed moral and spiritual leadership of corrupt men, but when Jesus comes He “will reign wisely as king, and administer justice and righteousness in the land.” He will be called “The LORD is Our Righteousness” (vv.5–6).\n\nWhile we lament today the wayward leadership of frail human beings, we can look forward to the promised hope of the Savior who will return to make things right, to rule with justice and equity, to bring peace and His eternal kingdom. The question we must ask is whose kingdom are we truly longing for? Are we putting our hope and trust in the failed systems and leaders of today, or are our hopes banked in the forever King Jesus, and His unsurpassed righteousness?\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n               ",

I doubt many of us would choose the work of the “weeping prophet.” Today’s reading contains some harsh words Jeremiah was called to deliver to those in power in and around Jerusalem. Jeremiah doesn’t have the luxury of telling God’s people that things are going to get better. Instead, he’s often tasked with the opposite, in essence saying, “It’s about to get a lot worse. God’s bringing His discipline against you.”\n\nOur own callings may not entail us having to be the bearer of bad news to every local leader and king; however, there may very well be days when our hearts are weary and feel helpless, when we would much rather give up and let someone else do the work. Jeremiah feels this pain intimately and laments over it. And in Jeremiah 20:7–18, he gives us words to pray when we, too, are bent out of shape and weary in our labors.\n\nAs we remember, Jeremiah’s calling was to proclaim the Word of the Lord to the kings of Judah and to Jerusalem. Yet in being faithful to God’s call, he was certainly met with more and more enemies, because the words God had given him to speak were words of judgment—words no one wanted to hear or receive. So they despised and plotted against the prophet.\n\nJeremiah felt this deeply. And so he prayed, essentially saying, “God, I’ve had it! I’m tired of being the bearer of bad news all the time. Tired of the people not listening and hating me. I’d rather hold your word up in my mouth, but it’s a fire that has to be spoken. So I’m just utterly frustrated I have to keep doing this and I wish I was never born.” Talk about honest prayer and lament!\n\nI am so thankful this raw and honest prayer is here within Scripture, because it validates two things for us. First, we can bring our frustrations to God, all of them, even our frustrations with Him. He is more than able to handle them. Second, God has not abandoned us. Even in the midst of anger and frustration, Jeremiah prays with hope: “But the LORD is with me like a violent warrior” (Jeremiah 20:11). Our laments can be frustration-filled pleas toward God, and when we cry out to Him, we can be reminded that He is still with us in our struggle.\n\nIn Christ, the Word of God made flesh, we have an advocate who welcomes our fears and frustrations and raw emotions in the moment. Bringing these things to Him shows our deep trust in Him. He is safe, and He is powerful, able to handle our disappointment, sorrow, even anger. He invites us to cry out to Him, to trust Him with our hearts and all He has called us to do.\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n               ",

Sometimes the lesson just doesn’t make its way past our thick skulls and into the gray matter of our brains. In having to repeat a lesson, good teachers will adapt their methods in an attempt to find another way to connect with our minds. Repeating the information verbatim would just be a waste of time; we need a new approach to get the facts to sink in.\n\nIn reading the book of Jeremiah, we see that the disciplinary training of Judah and Israel has been an exercise in repetition. The Lord has continued to come back to them over and over again, warning and rebuking and pleading with them to repent and come back to Him. And yet, they still will not repent of their idolatry, abandon the gods of other nations, and turn back to God. The lesson just isn’t sinking in.\n\nIn teaching the lessons of discipline, God brings Jeremiah and the nation to the pottery studio. It’s here that He teaches a simple yet profound lesson; just as a potter can do whatever he desires with a lump of clay in his hands, so God can do with the people He has created. God had promised His people blessing, but without turning away from their sin, He will bring judgment upon them. But if these same people living in rebellion will repent and turn to Him, He will bring blessing on them (Jeremiah 18:1–11).\n\nThe visual imagery should help make the point, but it doesn’t. Judah doesn’t respond well or receive Jeremiah’s warning from the Lord; instead, they persist in their rebellion (v.12). This time God has another pottery studio lesson for them. Jeremiah is commanded to buy a clay jar and go out with the elders of the people to a specific valley. There Jeremiah smashes the jar in front of them and tells them that God will smash the nation in the same way, in the same place, “for they have become obstinate, not obeying [His] words” (Jeremiah 19:15). The visual lessons are necessary to communicate the lesson Judah is failing to learn. God is all-powerful and holds authority over all things. He will break down and build up in the long game of pursuing the hearts of humanity.\n\nThese parables in the pottery studio are lessons for our hearts as well, asking us this question: What will God have to do in order to get through to us? What kind of sign or wonder will it take for us to listen and obey God’s word?\n\nThe Son of God became flesh and blood to call us to Himself once again. He pursued us to the point of His own death on the cross and resurrection from the grave. Jesus’s body was broken and shattered like that clay pot, all because of His great love for us. The signs are there, and the lessons are clear. Are we willing to see and pay attention to them, to believe and obey Jesus? The Father has gone to great lengths to call us home. May we not miss His message.\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n               ",

Day after day, the doctor sits down with patient after patient, examining their symptoms, reading their MRIs and CAT scans. And time after time, that physician is left with the task of delivering unfortunate news that, yes, it is cancer, and then advising on all the significant measures that will have to be taken in order to hopefully ensure survival. Being the constant bearer of bad news would be difficult and, potentially, very discouraging work. A day off here and there would be far more than a welcome respite—it would be absolutely necessary.\n\nJeremiah 17 takes us into the work of a prophet of the Lord. It’s a collection of messages that the prophet gave over the course of his ministry, warning against the effects of sin. It’s amazing how timeless these messages are because Jeremiah could just as easily be preaching this in our pulpits this weekend.\n\nHe calls Judah away from idol-worship and the fear of man, and into the fear of the Lord (Jeremiah 17:1–8). Jeremiah illuminates the sin-sick depravity of Judah’s hearts and minds, and then shows them the beauty of God and the folly of those who turn from Him (vv.9–13). The prophet’s message concludes with a call to obedience in observing the Sabbath (vv.19–27), which the Lord introduced to Israel when He gave them the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:8).\n\nYou can imagine how Jeremiah’s neighbors saw him. Perhaps at the very sight of him, they assumed bad news was coming their way. But his plea for them to turn to the Lord is honest and vulnerable. It is the cry of a leader trying to honor the ways of the Lord, even in the face of ridicule and rejection by the people he’s been called to (Jeremiah 17:14–18), which leads him to cry out to the Lord for rest and reprieve. The prophet’s experience here is one that encapsulates Lent well for us. This season is one of lament, repentance, petition, and a longing for rest; the cries issued within this passage can lead us into a fruitful pattern of prayer and reflection, if we’ll let them.\n\nSo what would it look like to fear and revere God over the opinion of other human beings? How might our lives change if we were to confess our idolatry, and instead set our sights and affection on the one true God? Are we willing to stop what we’re doing long enough to ask the Lord to test and search our hearts, to show us our waywardness? What would it look like to put all our hope and trust in Him and Him alone?\n\nRelationship with God is the most incredible blessing we could ever receive. The pause and practice of a Sabbath honors the Lord and recalibrates our hearts toward Him. Judah had lost sight of what truly matters. Too busy with profiteering, they neglected things like repentance, contemplation, and rest. Perhaps we do this as well, only to find we are heartsick because we’ve grown distant from the Lord. It is necessary to stop and make room for Him in our lives. He is the Great Physician, and He alone can heal our hearts.\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Comedian Jerry Seinfeld has a bit in one of his old comedy specials about fear. It goes something like this: “According to most studies, people’s number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does that sound right? This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral, you’re better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.”\n\nI think about this often because I am getting older, and the reality of death seems more real. My parents have gone on ahead. Many older family members have passed away. And increasingly, those who were my peers have gone on to the eternal reward.\n\nI think about it more now. Not in a morbid way, but because I know it is coming. Though I am relatively healthy, I can feel in my bones. I do not heal as fast as I once did. Endurance is not what it once was. And those once slight aches and pains rendered from pickup games of basketball games in the driveway with my sons are now more par for the course, expected. As I think about facing death, I wonder, How will I face it? What if the pain I am feeling is serious, and we have to sit in front of the doctor and hear the news of my coming death? I suppose everyone thinks about these things at some point, and I have no way of predicting what to expect. But I do know how I’d like to face it, and the band Switchfoot sums it up in their song, “Where I Belong”:\n\nAnd on that day I die\nI want to hold my head up high\nI want to tell you that I tried\nTo live it like a song\nAnd when I reach the other side\nI want to look You in the eye\nAnd know that I’ve arrived\nIn a world where I belong\n\nWhen I read these chapters from Jeremiah, my attention is on the prophet’s sadness and frustration about what is coming. He defends himself, as most of us would, and then he asks: “Why has my pain become unending, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed?” (Jeremiah 15:18).\n\nAll this is painful for Jeremiah, and the people of Judah, in a way that is hard for us to understand. We are a fairly mobile generation of people. Living elsewhere seems exotic, and sometimes I dream of living in the shadow of the Alps or in a small English village. But for God’s people at the time, those who were children of the promise, losing their land to pagans was like death.\n\nTrue, it was a death they deserved, but what is also true is how merciful God is. He tells Jeremiah (and later His people), “I will return them to their land that I gave to their ancestors” (Jeremiah 16:15). His revelation enables them to face this “death,” because ultimately, they know they will be returned to the land in which they belong.\n\nHow do we face death? We know what is really real. We set our minds and hearts on the one, true God. Through His life, death, and resurrection, we follow Him into a promise far greater than the land of Judah. We know we will journey not just into “heaven” but into the new heaven and earth, a new path altogether. We will step into a world where we belong.\n\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    There is a scene in Terrence Malick’s film The Tree of Life that I cannot stop thinking about. A middle-aged Jack, who is the protagonist of the story, is remembering his boyhood sins. One of them is a big one. He breaks into a woman’s house after she leaves, walks around in it and after finding a nightgown, he steals it. You see him running away from the house with it in his hands, which seems pretty reckless, and he stops and tries to bury it by the river that runs through town. Breathing hard after fleeing the scene of the crime, he decides against burying the garment, and instead casts it into the river. In the next scene, you see him walking home, and the weight of the guilt is heavy on him. He encounters his mom in the front yard as dusk settles on their home. She is the epitome of grace in the movie. And she is worried. She can see the guilt and shame and ruin on his face just like we can.\n\nMalick’s magnificent film is about the book of Job and his suffering, but after reading Jeremiah 13 and 14 and then watching the film again, I’m left to wonder whether Malick had this scene from Jeremiah in mind. I know it’s a stretch, but the ruin of the undergarment in the film and the ruin of the undergarments in Jeremiah are somehow drawn together in my mind now.\n\nGod has Jeremiah do all this with the underwear so he can get a physical glimpse of the sins of “Judah and Jerusalem,” and what God will do to them because they have gone after other gods. It’s a devastating picture. And as we continue to read, things only come to look worse. And yet, Jeremiah does not lose hope. Even though God has made it clear that judgment is coming, Jeremiah tells God, “Are you not the LORD our God? We therefore put our hope in you, for you have done all these things” (Jeremiah 14:22).\n\nWhy does Jeremiah have this hope? Because he knows that all that is happening is righteous and just, and it comes from a God he knows is more powerful than the idolatry that has brought this misery upon Judah. Jeremiah’s eyes are fixed on the reality of God and not just the misery and ruin and sin all around him.\n\nHope often eludes us. It shouldn’t, but it does. We so easily take our eyes from the God who has saved us, and instead, fix our eyes on what we think is a higher reality: our surrounding circumstances, the things we can immediately see, touch, and feel. Maybe we are hopeless because of our own sin. Maybe we are lacking hope because of the destruction of someone else’s sin. When that happens, we have lost sight of what’s true: the reality of the God who reigns in the heavens and offers grace to us in Christ here and now.\n\nAt the end of The Tree of Life, middle-aged Jack gets a glorious vision of hope. I don’t want to give it away, but that hope lands on him because he has glimpsed what is real and not just the suffering he has endured. Hope is not wishful thinking. Hope is faith staring straight into the eyes of grace despite the ruin around us.\n\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Yesterday, I was reviewing a lesson from the Old Testament with my seventh grade class. I was trying to help them see something that even we, as adults, struggle to understand and put into practice: the scriptures are not primarily about us. The scriptures are primarily about God and His Son, Jesus, and the glory of their redemptive work throughout all of creation. My goal as their teacher is for them to see Jesus’s life and work in each story and on every page of the Bible.\n\nBut I also want them to be able to recognize themselves in the stories of the Old Testament. Adam and Eve, Jacob and Ruth and David—and everyone else throughout the course of humanity, for that matter—are all made in the image of God. We all are, including my students. Yes, we all sin in a fallen world, but the reflection of God, of His goodness and glory, is still there, in our DNA, so to speak. So while I do want them to find themselves in the pages of Scripture, I also want to help them avoid the mistake of present cultural voices, which so often place humanity at the center of everything.\n\nBut in truth, I still make this same mistake all the time. While reading Jeremiah 12, I was thrown for a loop. I saw myself clearly in his complaints directed at God. Who has not asked, “Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the treacherous live at ease?” (Jeremiah 12:1). In essence, Why do those who do not follow God seem to prosper anyway?\n\nThrough Jeremiah, God was revealing my own sin and tendency toward judging, how I have damaged people through my words and actions. It was a humbling and painful thing to realize, but I know now that it was necessary. With fresh eyes and new understanding, I saw how God addressed His “evil neighbors” who’d been attacking His people, Judah (v.14). God does not flinch when it comes to sin. Jeremiah 12:16–17 makes that clear, but He is also compassionate. He longs to bring His people home. I think this is perhaps what God meant when He said, “After I have uprooted them, I will once again have compassion on them and return each one to his inheritance and to his land” (v.15).\n\nInitially, I assumed all that compassion after all that uprooting was directed toward a wayward Judah, and that only wrath and vengeance would be doled out to those evil neighbors. But I was wrong yet again; there is no “us” and “them,” because all fall short of God’s glory and plan for them, and no one—not one of us in all of humanity—is righteous (Romans 3:23;10–11).\n\nI am them, and so are you—Gentiles, those who were not part of God’s original covenant with Israel. “Once [we] were not a people, but now [we] are God’s people,” receiving the grace and mercy extended to us through faith in Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:10). I had not expected this, but I suppose that’s how grace and mercy tend to work. I’d been primed to see myself in Judah, God’s people. I’d forgotten that as a non-Jew, I was outside the covenant mercies till Christ procured them for me. It’s a beautiful, surprising, and undeserved foretaste of the compassion we now enjoy under the new covenant mercies in Christ. While we were still enemies of God, Christ died for us (Romans 5:10).\n\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    What exactly is “the good life”?\n\nI watched enough television in the nineties to have a pretty clear understanding of what “the good life” is, at least by culture’s standards: a life rounded out by a holiday commercial for a luxury car brand, complete with a large, red bow on top.\n\nYou know the one I’m talking about, showcasing a hypothetical life we should all be aiming for. Beautiful home. Beautiful wife. Beautiful family. Enough income and financial security to gift a luxury car—specifically, a Lexus—to your spouse, with a gentle, perfect snow falling in the background just as you’re handing over the keys. We used to joke about the size of the bow and humorously wonder how much money someone has to earn in order to be able to give such a gift. Over time, making fun of commercials like this one became a ubiquitous part of the holiday season.\n\nTo be clear, there is nothing inherently wrong with driving a nice car like a Lexus. But still, Lexus knew what they were doing: tapping into a vision of “the good life,” offering millions of people a taste of what it could look like, which, of course, included a brand-new car. They knew we would buy into the idea of wealth and luxury. Now, I like to think I’m immune to such marketing ploys, but about ten years ago, I bought in to all the hype…and bought a Lexus. I’m actually ashamed to admit that, at some point, I looked at that beautiful (used) car and thought, I made it. I have arrived.\n\nI’m not entirely sure where I’d arrived, but I’m pretty convinced God was not so pleased with my assessment of the situation, of what constitutes good and life-giving and truly worthy of my staking my security on it. Sure enough, within months of purchasing that car, it failed to even turn over. It wouldn’t start. My personal symbol of achievement and “arrival,” well, it’s what a mechanic might call “a lemon.”\n\nExperiences like this made me question my views of success and achievement. Not long ago, I was confronted with a startling idea: What if the good life is a life lived in obedience to God? What if we had so much confidence in God and His wisdom and love for us that we when we hear His commands and instruction for living, we understand that they are a path to not just “the good life,” but the best life possible?\n\nJust like the people of Judah who Jeremiah was prophesying to, I am prone to look to culture around me for examples of how I ought to live and what I ought to prioritize. However, God Himself has made it clear what can make life good and meaningful, though certainly not always easy:\n\n“Obey me, and do everything that I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God” (Jeremiah 11:4).\n\nI’m not sure why it’s taken me so long to get this. Maybe I’ve been blinded by some kind of fool’s gold, the distractions of this world. But nothing makes more sense, really. While it is true we obey as a way of glorifying God, it is nonetheless true obedience that is the way forward into a life of blessedness with God. We hear it here with Jeremiah and with Jesus when He says, “If you love me, you will keep my commands” (John 14:15).\n\nWhat kind of life do we get when we are obedient to God? We get life in relationship with Him—the best life possible.\n\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n               ",

But at times, these unplanned, sometimes beautiful and sometimes hard conversations become just plain hard to manage. One particular day, I had to stop trying to teach whatever the content of the day was meant to be. I asked my students to stop talking amongst themselves, to come back to the task at hand, and they did… just as soon as they were done with whatever they were talking about. Needless to say, I was at my wit’s end.\n\nSo I decided a come-to-Jesus moment was in order. I addressed their behavior, their lack of focus, and their unwillingness to give their attention to the lesson. My students were not happy. To these students, their unrestrained conversation demonstrated their devotion to the topic at hand—after all, they were excited to talk about theology!\n\nTheir enthusiasm and willingness to engage were great. But as their teacher, what I value most is respect for me and their fellow students. That respect is shown through obedience to the structure and rules of my classroom. My students didn’t like this message any more than Judah did when God admonished them through His prophet Jeremiah for failing to pay attention to His commands:\n\n“When I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, \n\nI did not speak with them or command them concerning burnt offering and sacrifice. However, I did give them this command: ‘Obey me, and then I will be your God, and you will be my people. Follow every way I command you so that it may go well with you’” (Jeremiah 7:22–23).\n\nGod values obedience to Him even more than offerings, sacrifices, and worship (Proverbs 21:3). Obedience is what indicates faith. Obedience did not buy God’s love, but it did show that His people believed Him when He said, “I am the LORD, showing faithful love, justice, and righteousness on the earth, for I delight in these things” (Jeremiah 9:24).\n\nObedience is the evidence of our confidence that God is who He says He is: the one true God, the one worth listening to. We know He still delights in these things because of the cross, when Christ Himself was obedient to the Father, even to the point of death (Philippians 2:8). There we see His faithful love for sinners and His justice for sin. On the cross, He displays a kind of compassion and righteousness that is far beyond our understanding (Isaiah 55:8). Christ’s compassionate obedience to the Father should lead us to raise our hands in worship of Him, but it should also lead us to live a life of obedience to God.\n\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n               ",

I’m something of a grammar nerd, so I want to ask, “What’s wrong with that last drop?” Apparently, I’m not the only one. I recently read that since the company first started using that tagline, people have been sending letters and emails facetiously asking if the last drop is less than good, just so-so, or downright poison. But “good through the last drop,” while more accurate, doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue in the same way.\n\nAll this has me thinking: Would you drink a cup of coffee if one drop of it was something less than good—a spot of bubonic plague perhaps, maybe just a little bit of paint thinner, or a dash of DDT? Probably not. Whether it’s coffee or something else we hope to enjoy, we want purity, plain and simple. Even if ninety-nine percent of the thing is perfect, a little bit of nastiness will ruin the whole batch.\n\nGod has always wanted purity from His people. He calls those He loves to be undivided in their loyalties and obedient to His commands. In the book of Jeremiah, God compares the people of Judah to silver, and He makes Jeremiah as a tester of precious metals: “I have appointed you to be an assayer among my people—a refiner—so you may know and assay their way of life” (Jeremiah 6:27). What Jeremiah finds, however, is that more than just a drop of the silver is impure. “They are bronze and iron; all of them are corrupt” (v. 28).\n\nIn ancient metalworking, lead and fire were used to draw out the impurities in silver (see v.29). These impurities included lesser metals like bronze and iron. Jeremiah was called by God to be “lead” for the people of Judah. But the more he attempted to purify the people, the more he found nothing but bronze and iron. In the end, the people of Judah “are called rejected silver, for the LORD has rejected them” (v.30).\n\nYears later, Judah would be attacked by Babylon. The nation would fall, and its people would be led away into exile. Sad as that is, you and I are no less impure. We, too, are more iron and bronze than silver. But that is why Christ came. He stands in our place today so that God sees Christ’s perfect purity instead of our imperfections. But God hasn’t changed His mind about wanting a people marked by purity, so He sent His Holy Spirit to purify us and make us holy. He is the lead that brings our impurities to the surface. One day, all who know Christ will be made new. We will be pristine and spotless—the purest silver imaginable, every drop as good as the last.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    This season, as we intentionally shift our hearts away from ordinary things and bend them instead toward the cross of Christ, I am taken up into the gospel story. Specifically, I think a lot of the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11–32). Today’s reading in Jeremiah brought this story into sharp focus for me.\n\nDespite its name, the parable of the prodigal, or “lost,” son is actually about two sons, both of whom care less about the father than they do about the father’s stuff. The younger son does the unthinkable: he asks the father for his inheritance early. In the Jewish culture of the first century, such a request was essentially the same as saying, “Dad, I wish you were dead. Now give me what’s mine.” The elder son is hardly any better. Though his sins are not so pronounced, it seems he may care even less about the father than his younger brother had. At the end of the story, all he can do is recount what, in his mind, his father owes him for his service.\n\nJust as there are two brothers in Jesus’s parable, there are two “sisters” in the book of Jeremiah—the nations of Judah and Israel. Like the younger son in Jesus’s parable, Israel’s sins are obvious. God says, “I observed that it was because unfaithful Israel had committed adultery that I had sent her away and had given her a certificate of divorce” (Jeremiah 3:8). Judah, like the older brother, sees what happened to Israel and doesn’t heed the inherent warning: “Yet in spite of all this, her treacherous sister Judah didn’t return to me with all her heart—only in pretense” (v.10). In other words, Judah is giving lip service to faithfulness, but she is just as rebellious as Israel was before her.\n\nIn Jesus’s parable, the younger son returns home, wanting nothing more than to become his father’s servant—he knows what he did was wrong. But the Father does much more than make his boy a servant; he forgives him, welcomes him with open arms, and gives him a robe and a ring, symbols of his sonship and authority in the family. In like manner, God invites Israel home here in Jeremiah, saying, “Return, unfaithful Israel…. I will not be angry forever. Only acknowledge your guilt” (Jeremiah 3:12–13). But He goes further: “Return, you faithless children—this is the LORD’s declaration—for I am your master, and I will take you… and I will bring you to Zion” (v.14). Zion, of course, is a reference to Jerusalem, which is not part of the northern kingdom of Israel. It’s where the temple is, where God’s presence dwells among the people. God, then, is promising to bring these lost children fully home. He’s intent on giving them a robe and a ring, and not just servant’s rations.\n\nWhen Jesus finishes the parable, the older son’s story is left unfinished. We don’t know if he will repent of his pride and enter into the party—and the father’s love—or if he will choose to remain out in the cold. At this point in the book of Jeremiah, Judah has the same choice. Even though exile is coming, this older sister will be invited back too: “In those days the house of Judah will join with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land I have given your ancestors to inherit” (Jeremiah 3:18).\n\nOur God does not change. He is a Father who welcomes home His lost children. Jeremiah showed us this truth centuries before it came from the lips of Jesus. As we examine our own lives during this season of Lent, let our hearts shout, “Here we are, coming to you, for you are the LORD our God” (Jeremiah 3:22). At the same time, let’s not underestimate the goodness of our God: “But while the son was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him” (Luke 15:20).\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n               ",

I didn’t grow up with a dream of someday being a writer, and I wasn’t an English major in college. After several false starts, I stumbled into this work, and now I can’t imagine doing anything else. It fits me, like I was made for it. I’m sure not everyone who reads my words on a page or on a screen would agree—I’m looking at you, one-star review on Amazon—but writing is the only work I’ve found that has gotten sweeter with time.\n\nThe book of Jeremiah opens with the title prophet’s calling. God says to Jeremiah, “I chose you before I formed you in the womb; I set you apart before you were born” (Jeremiah 1:5). Jeremiah was literally made for the work God placed before him. Yet I wonder if it felt like that for the prophet. It is difficult to read about Jeremiah’s life, because it was filled with persecution, hardship, and sorrow. In many ways, his journey mirrors Christ’s own. He spoke God’s words to people who refused to receive them, and they tortured him as a result. Yet Jeremiah was faithful to his calling and obeyed the Lord, no matter how difficult or, in some cases, how bizarre the commands were.\n\nThe main thrust of Jeremiah’s work was to pronounce judgment—first upon Judah, but also upon the surrounding nations. He was a bearer of bad news, and as the book of Jeremiah makes clear, folks weren’t exactly eager to hear what Jeremiah had to say. But there was another message being proclaimed by the prophet even when he wasn’t speaking: his life was a testament to the faithfulness of God.\n\nJeremiah’s uncompromising endurance under the weight of suffering proclaimed loudly that God is better than any comfort this world can offer. At the same time, God never left Jeremiah. Early on, the Lord told His friend, “They will fight against you but never prevail over you, since I am with you to rescue you” (Jeremiah 1:19). And this proved true time and time again as Jeremiah kept to his unenviable task.\n\nI see in Jeremiah’s life an example for us to follow. How we react when this world throws its darkness at us is a proclamation of the gospel. Walking with God is worth more than any temporary stay of trouble. As the song says, “Just give me Jesus,” because really, there is nothing better. And just as the Lord was with Jeremiah, He has promised to be with us too: “I will never leave you or abandon you” (Hebrews 13:5). Our rescue, of course, is not guaranteed like it was for Jeremiah, at least not in temporal terms. Rather our rescue is eternal life, sealed by the Holy Spirit and possible only because Christ, like Jeremiah before Him, obeyed the Lord.\n\nNo matter what your life looks like, no matter your specific calling, you have a message from God to proclaim—the gospel—so let it be heard in the way you live your life. The world is watching.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                    \n\n                    Lent is more than a season on the Church calendar. It’s a journey.\n\nThe road we take from Ash Wednesday to Holy Saturday is not an easy one. It is a path of preparation and testing, and as we travel, we are invited to set our faces toward the cross. But it is not a road without joy, for Jesus Himself travels with us, inviting us into a deeper relationship with Him and a richer experience of His kingdom.\n\nIn the book of Jeremiah, the stones are laid for the road to Calvary. Through the prophet the Lord first revealed the mystery of the new covenant. Jeremiah announced to Israel that God was going to do something new in this world, something that would unravel the knots of sin and death and bring us back to our Creator.\n\nThrough Jeremiah, the Lord promised, “I will forgive their iniquity and never again remember their sin” (Jeremiah 31:34), and it was Jesus who gave these words their fulfillment. Holding up the cup at the Last Supper, He made the connection to the cross clear: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you” (Luke 22:20).\n\nThe book of Jeremiah recounts the last days of Judah before the destruction of Jerusalem and the sorrow of the Babylonian exile. It is itself a picture of where our sins lead us apart from the grace of God. In this account, we see our own depravity. Though our sins may differ from those of our ancient counterparts, our hearts are just as prone to wander. And it is only when we see the depths of our own sin that we can see the glory of the cross for what it truly is. During Lent, we take time to reflect on Christ’s sacrifice, and we repent of our own sins that made the cross necessary in the first place.\n\nThere is also much to gain in getting to know Jeremiah, who stands apart as a faithful man among faithless people—persecuted, beaten, and left for dead because he spoke the words God gave him to speak. He suffered for the gospel long before there was a complete and proper gospel message to proclaim. His life is an arrow pointing to Jesus, who was also obedient despite the cost, and who recognized that God-given joy is worth more than anything this world has to offer.\n\nThis Lenten season, we will follow Jesus to the mount of crucifixion, but we will do so with Jeremiah as our guide and fellow disciple for the journey. “‘Look, the days are coming’—this is the Lord’s declaration—‘when I will fulfill the good promise that I have spoken’” (Jeremiah 33:14). The cross proclaims this truth, and the empty tomb assures us that our hope is not in vain.\n\nWritten by John Greco\n\n               ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n                   \n\n                   After His baptism and before the start of His ministry on earth, the incarnate Son of God walked into the wilderness, no food or drink in hand. He fasted forty days and forty nights, Scripture tells us, and then “the tempter approached him” (Matthew 4:3). Hungry and thirsty and holding no tangible thing of value, Jesus was tempted to take hold of power, to test the Father’s love for Him, to make for Himself a feast of bread to satiate His languishing body. When His human weakness was met with temptation, how did He respond? Using the words of Scripture, He turned to the Father.\n\nInstead of reaching out for what the world would say He needed, Jesus clung to what He couldn’t live without: “He answered, ‘It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God’” (Matthew 4:4). Rather than yielding to the devil’s enticements, Jesus yielded Himself to the Father and glorified Him: “Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him” (v.10).\n\nOur culture views empty-handedness as the lowliest of conditions. We are trained to find our worth in usefulness and status, and to seek joy in our possessions. On the off chance we look down to find our hands empty, we quickly scoop up something to hold on to—some bit of work or wealth, some duty or distraction to busy our bodies and entertain our minds. But this hands-full gospel is not the message of Jesus.\n\nLent is a season where we once again remember that our hope and strength are found in nothing but the cross of Christ. By engaging in daily Scripture reading, prayer, confession, and repentance in these weeks leading up to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, we retrain our hearts to embrace the salvation we cannot earn. We came empty-handed when we first gave our lives to Him, and we have nothing of our own as we return to Him now—only what He has freely and graciously given us.\n\nThis forty-day walk into the wilderness will bring us face to face with the depth of our lack, our human frailty, and our sin. But it will bring us to the cross, where our High Priest, who modeled perfect dependence on the Father, will show us the cost of our forgiveness in the marks on His body, even as He invites us to receive mercy.\n\nLent is an invitation to put down everything we have picked up in order to take hold of the only One who can truly satisfy our heart’s deepest longings. It is a call to turn back, and experience a season of refreshing for our souls (Acts 3:19). Come with open hands, and freely receive (Isaiah 55).\n\nWritten by Amanda Bible Williams\n\n               ",
