        "devo_summary": "Christians don’t just read the Bible. We enter into a life-long relationship with it. We read it over the course of a lifetime, knowing we will never exhaust all there is to know or glean from God’s Word. Often, when we return to passages we’ve read before, we come to them having changed since the last time we spent time with those verses. We go through things that shift how we see the world—vocational upheaval, marriage, divorce, parenthood, miscarriage, life-altering diagnoses, unexpected windfalls of good-fortune, and the like.\n\nAs we experience more of the joys and heartaches associated with living in this world, we look at Scripture through different eyes. Sometimes a theological idea we thought we had wrapped up in a tidy bow suddenly becomes shot through with questions we never thought to ask when we were younger and had not suffered much.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I am so drawn to the story of Peter’s reinstatement in John 21:1–19. Here we find Simon Peter, who was one of Jesus’s closest friends, sitting with the fact that he had denied Jesus in His greatest hour of need. He had done so exactly as Jesus predicted he would, even though he swore this sort of failure wasn’t something he was capable of (Mark 14:31).\n\nI love the story because it’s about someone who appeared to have as good of a relationship with Jesus as anyone could have, and yet he himself was weak. When Jesus appeared on the shore cooking breakfast for His friends, and caused their empty nets to be filled with more fish than they could handle, Peter recognized Jesus, because this is the same way Jesus first called Peter—with a miraculous catch of fish (Luke 5:1–11).\n\nWhen Peter jumped out of the boat and cast his drenched and dripping self at the feet of Jesus, he had no relational ground to stand on. He’d betrayed his best friend, his Lord. And yet, Jesus asked Peter the most simple and searching question imaginable: “Do you love me?” And Peter, paradox that he is, answered truthfully. He did love Jesus. He did. When Jesus said, “Feed my sheep,” He was hearkening back to when He first called Peter and told him He would make him a fisher of men. Peter’s failure did not disqualify him from Jesus’s love, or from Jesus’s call on his life.\n\nI love this passage because it offers so much hope to people who go through seasons of struggle and failure and wonder if they have lost the love of God. Peter could do nothing but receive from Jesus. On that shore, he had nothing to offer. And yet, he longed to be near his Lord and friend. We know this because earlier, before Jesus was crucified, He taught that people would ultimately need to be nourished by His flesh and blood. It was a teaching many found too difficult to embrace, and they left. But when Jesus asked His disciples if they, too, would leave, it was Peter who said, “Lord, to whom will we go? You have the words of eternal life” (John 6:68).\n\nPeter’s story reminds us that the thing we must cling to most, and fear above all else, is the Word of Christ (Psalm 119:161). Though our circumstances change, and even we change, He does not (Hebrews 13:8). Where else can we go?\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

        "devo_title": "I Have Not Forgotten Your Instruction",
        "devo_summary": "It was the first time I’d ever stood up in front of our church congregation, some fifteen years ago. Alongside our fellow “new members,” my husband and I looked out over the church body we were joining, as our pastor read our favorite Bible verses aloud and introduced us by name. Never one to go first, I listened from the end of the line as one inspirational verse after another was read into the microphone, each one offering another shade of affirmation, encouragement, and faith. But as I listened for the first time to the verses of other new congregants, I felt panic set in: Had I misunderstood the instruction? The sound of my blood pumping in my ears grew louder, nearly drowning out my pastor’s voice completely, until my husband gently squeezed my hand to hear my own “favorite verse” from Scripture:\n\n“There is nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work. \n\nI have seen that even this is from God’s hand, \n\nbecause who can eat and who can enjoy life apart from him?” (Ecclesiastes 2:24–25).\n\nYup.\n\nIn all of Scripture, with its sweeping poetry and prose, that was “my verse”—is my verse, I should say. In that moment of pride, I began to doubt my seemingly simple choice. I was afraid that, out of context, it misrepresented my faith and understanding of the gospel and downplayed my affection for God. I’ve since come to realize just how accurately it still reflects my relationship with Him and the sin that so often distracts me from Him: my heart’s unfortunate tendency to wander.\n\nI’m easily distracted, you see. By work. By striving. By perfectionism of the textbook-definition variety. And when I get caught up in working and worrying, spinning myself into a cycle that pushes God away from the center of my heart’s affections—that’s when He reminds me of what’s true. He gently squeezes my heart in such a way that I’m forced to acknowledge the emptiness I’m feeling, the deep ache I work so hard to numb with the distraction of productivity, when I try to live my life with my gaze affixed on anyone or anything “apart from him” (John 15:5).\n\nThe Westminster Shorter Catechism posits that “the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.” In my own walk with God, I’ve tended to focus on the first part, on what it might mean to glorify Him. I’ve twisted the idea of bearing His image into a works-based, legalistic, shallow religion that has very little to do with my God.\n\nBut to enjoy Him. To be satisfied in Him. To delight in His Word. To stop and savor His provision and the work He’s called me to, not just for what they might become in the future, but for what they are today—well, that sings of enjoying relationship with my very relational God, the one who is ready to answer when we call out to Him, when we seek Him with all our heart (Psalm 119:145). His Word is a very precious gift that instructs us on how to best live this life He’s given us (v.153). And it is clear: in knowing Him, being in His presence, there is abundant joy and eternal pleasure. But apart from Him, we will never be satisfied (Psalm 16:11). This is the instruction my wandering heart so desperately needs.\n\nWritten by Kara Gause",

        "devo_summary": "Reading the Bible has always been hard for me. That may sound strange coming from someone who works for a company with the motto, “Women in the Word of God every day.” Over the years, being in the Word has proved tricky for several reasons, one of which is its familiarity. I’ve read Scripture my whole life, yet the transformative stories and commands lose their potency when I grow used to their rhythms and cadence, to the way the words sound when they roll off my tongue.\n\nLet me be clear: Scripture can’t lose its power or potency. But I can diminish its work in my life through my own apathy. I can choose not to slow down and really open myself to the text or the Holy Spirit who speaks through it.\n\nA decade ago, I walked through a situation that required me to love a friend and leader in our church community with what the Bible calls agape love—a love that seeks someone else’s wellbeing. Since I could no longer speak with this person directly, the development of this love had to take place solely between God and me. So, my best friend and I made a pact to read 1 Corinthians 13 every day for a whole year. The love passage. This well-known chapter was the best model we could find for the altruistic, Christlike, agape kind of love.\n\nJust because it was a well-known chapter didn’t mean it was easy to put into action. By focusing our attention on one passage for an extended period of time, the purpose was long-term, personal transformation. I began reading it to myself out loud, as if to absorb into my very being. I can still hear the lines echoing through my car, as I read it aloud each morning:\n\n“Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not envy, \n\nis not boastful, is not arrogant, is not rude, \n\nis not self-seeking, is not irritable, \n\nand does not keep a record of wrongs” (1 Corinthians 13:4–5).\n\nThese aren’t just eloquent lines of verse or truisms to tuck away in our back pocket. They’re the living, active words of God. My friend and I didn’t set out to memorize the chapter, but within a couple weeks it was buried inside us. I found that my heart had been softened toward God’s Word and toward this person from our community. And even though it may not have redeemed the situation, it changed my heart.\n\nAs Psalm 119 says, “Your decrees are wondrous; therefore I obey them” (v.129). Let’s obey God’s decrees by burying them inside us, even if that means reciting them aloud for 365 days. When our hearts have a chance to catch up with our minds, we begin to embody truth and become not a clanging cymbal but a transformed child of God (1Corinthians 13:1).\n\nWritten by Bailey Gillespie",

        "devo_summary": "“Okay. What have you learned from this?”\n\nThis phrase, spoken by my father, was a mainstay of my growing up. I heard it one summer afternoon when I was eight years old, following my sheepish confession that I’d accidentally shot my neighbor, Mr. Horner, with my BB gun. I heard it late one snowy Michigan night, when my car came to rest against a chain-link fence—after I’d impatiently tried (unsuccessfully) to maneuver it between a ditch and another parked car in my girlfriend’s driveway—resulting in a phone call to my dad, asking him to come help me dig my car out of a snowdrift. And I’ve uttered that same question to myself countless times since, even as I’ve grown older and the learning opportunities have evolved with time and age.\n\nAlways spoken in love, and almost always received with humility, it’s a phrase so simple, yet it resounds with the essence of the relationship between a dad and a son. I’m deeply grateful to fall into the increasingly receding percentage of men whose fathers are truly fatherly.\n\nWe might not expect to find such a rare, human moment between father and son within Scripture. While God’s Word is relatable and relevant across time, I still struggle sometimes to grasp the idea that these words were written to real people who existed in a real time and place. But that wasn’t the case for me when I read David’s words to his son, Solomon, in 1 Chronicles 28. His words could’ve just as easily been written to me in a text message from my dad on any given Monday morning:\n\n“As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, \n\nand serve him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind, \n\nfor the LORD searches every heart and understands the intention of every thought.\n\nIf you seek him, he will be found by you” (v.9).\n\nI can almost picture the memories and hard-won lessons flashing before David’s eyes as he distills his life into just two simple sentences, passing down parting wisdom to his son. After charging Solomon with the great responsibility of building the temple and outlining the requirements of the job, David’s parting words to his son, and some of his last we read in the Bible, include loving encouragement that ultimately points Solomon to a present, secure, steadfast God. He tells Solomon to “be strong and courageous, and do the work… for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He won’t leave you or abandon you until all the work for the service of the LORD’s house is finished” (v.20).\n\nWhat a delight it is to be offered wisdom by those who’ve come before us, and in turn, to offer guidance to those who will come after us. But isn’t that what this entire book, the Bible, is about? It’s a lamp to lead our feet along the path of life (Psalm 119:105). It gives guidance from a loving Father through stories of His own and others’ that are full of grace and love, that shape us and call us to grow. May we honor the same Father of David and Solomon, feel loved by Him, and love like Him every day.\n\nWritten by Ryan Myers",

        "devo_summary": "His photo was taped to my computer monitor at work and to the refrigerator door at home—a three-year-old boy with olive skin, black hair, deep brown eyes, and a dimple above each cheek. He was a child of God with no earthly mama or baba to call his own, and I wanted so badly for him to be ours.\n\nI’ve said that adoption feels as miraculous as childbirth, a million little pieces that must fall perfectly into place for that blessed homecoming to occur. It seemed all but impossible in the beginning—too much paperwork, too much money, too many unknowns. And then there was his heart. This image-bearer was created by God with a very special heart, one that somehow managed to channel blood throughout his small frame despite missing some very important vessels. He’s been a miracle from the start.\n\nSomewhere in those early days of wondering if this beautiful, brokenhearted boy could be our son, I read a passage from Isaiah 41 that made my own heart beat loud and fast.\n\n“I am the LORD, the God of Israel. I will not abandon them… \n\nI will open rivers on the barren heights, and springs in the middle of the plains. \n\nI will turn the desert into a pool and dry land into springs… \n\nSo that all may see and know, consider and understand, \n\nthat the hand of the LORD has done this, \n\nthe Holy One of Israel has created it” (Isaiah 41:17–18,20).\n\nI taped those words to my computer monitor, right next to that dimpled smile. It was a promise from God to His people, and it became my prayer in the joy and hope and helplessness of the days and months ahead.\n\nLord, do what we cannot. Be who we cannot. Create vessels where there are none, and a road home for this boy of ours, if indeed he’s ours. Create what only you can create, as only You can. May all who see it know that You and You alone bring life and hope.\n\nPsalm 119:89 says that God’s Word is forever, “firmly fixed in heaven.” But the concept of an unbreakable thing is difficult to understand when you yourself are broken. The idea that something lasts forever feels like fiction when the world we live in is filled with people, places, and promises that fade. But God’s Word is both unbreakable and everlasting. Tethering my heart to it changes the way I walk through this wounded, temporary world. So, I grabbed hold of that Isaiah passage, and I still haven’t let it go.\n\nOur son did come home, despite all the obstacles. And after his first heart catheterization here, the surgeon showed us images we’d prayed for, but never dreamed we’d see: vessels where there once were none, tangible hope created from nothing. But would God have been good if that catheterization had found nothing new, no surgical path forward? A resounding, Yes. Because our hope is not in healed hearts or an oasis planted in the desert; our hope is in the One who speaks arteries and myrtle trees into existence, whose Word never fades or fails, even when our bodies most certainly will.\n\nThose verses I stared at day after day in that season—the same ones I clung to by his hospital bed in the year that followed—do not guarantee an outcome. They guarantee God’s goodness. He is bigger than outcomes, even when our circumstances shift and our hearts ache. We can trust the God who makes all things new.\n\nWritten by Amanda Bible Williams",

        "devo_summary": "I grew up going to church three times a week and met some of my closest friends (even to this day!) in youth group. Most of my Facebook statuses in high school were inspirational Bible verses that I hoped would encourage my friends at my public high school who weren’t believers. I went to a Christian university for my undergraduate degree, where mandatory chapel was held twice a week, and every student was required to take six semesters worth of Bible classes. I interned at a local church and even earned a minor degree in the Bible. And then, I went to graduate divinity school.\n\nBut somewhere along the way, I stopped delighting in Scripture. I saw it as something to be studied, but not something to be taken to heart. I began to think of God as something to learn about rather than someone to know. To date, this was one of the most confusing times in my life so far.\n\nAfter a time spent in this confusing season, I was given a special project at work; I was instructed to go through the entire book of Genesis, chapter by chapter, writing discussion questions along the way for kids aged eleven to fifteen.\n\nI don’t know the last time you read through the book of Genesis (maybe in January when we read it together, as a community), but there are some stories in that book that are, well, a little less than age-appropriate for young teens. As I was going through some of the trickier passages, the discussion point I kept coming back to was that God keeps His promises to His people. His people keep turning away from Him, not believing Him, disobeying Him and turning to other gods, but God is consistently faithful to His promises.\n\nOne of the passages that fell into this category was the story of Sarah and her pregnancy with Isaac. When God told her she would become pregnant in her old age, Sarah laughed at the very thought (Genesis 18:9–15). But God kept His promise to her, and she bore a son (Genesis 21:1–7). After reading and working through the rest of the book of Genesis, I went into my friend’s office exasperated and frustrated with myself because I couldn’t find anything else for the discussion questions. She encouraged me to keep at it and do my best, and reassured me that maybe it was okay if God keeping His promises was the main theme of the project.\n\nSoon after completing the project, I realized that what had been frustrating me about the book of Genesis was exactly what I needed to hear and understand about God in a season of my own confusion and doubt: God keeps His promises to His people. He keeps His promises when your world seems to come crashing down. He keeps His promises when your best friend betrays you, when a dear family member falls ill, when the plans you had for your life have suddenly fallen to pieces around you. I know He does because I’ve seen it in my own life. His promises to His people are true. We can put our hope in Him to do so (Psalm 119:81). What a beautiful gift.\n\nWritten by Ellen Taylor",

        "devo_summary": "I remember listening to journalist Malcolm Gladwell interview Nashville legend and famed songwriter Bobby Braddock. Their conversation centered on what goes into writing a truly sad song, the kind of tune that finds you driving with one hand on the steering wheel so the other can be free to wipe the tears from your eyes.\n\nAs they talked, they decided that country music has a leg up on rock and pop when it comes to mournful tracks, but the question that lingered was Why? In the end, Braddock said it came down to details: “We cry when melancholy collides with specificity.” It’s one thing to sing about heartache, and another thing entirely to sing about standing by a lost friend’s grave and the angels’ faces delighting to welcome that friend home. Take a listen to “Go Rest High on That Mountain” by Vince Gill to hear what I’m talking about.\n\nThe reason that details help sad songs resonate with us is because they echo our own experience. We live in a world of details, not generalities. Somehow, the details make a thing more real. When it comes to God’s Word, I delight in the details. You see, in the ancient world, there was no paper. Instead, texts were written on papyrus, a material similar to paper but made out of certain flattened reeds—and papyrus wasn’t cheap. That means that everything included in God’s Word is important. There are no throwaway lines, no unimportant details.\n\nIn the story of Rahab, there’s a detail that jumps off the page for me. When she lets the two Israelite spies down through her window, she does so with a “scarlet cord” (Joshua 2:18). And it was this scarlet cord that would identify her home and keep her safe when the Israelites later attacked Jericho. It wasn’t brown or blue or white. It was a scarlet rope—and that makes all the difference in telling this story.\n\nFor those early Israelite readers of Rahab’s account, they would have connected the red color of the rope “dripping” down the window frame with the lamb’s blood a previous generation had brushed on the doorframes of their homes. While still slaves in Egypt, God had passed over the houses of the Hebrews on the night the firstborn in every household in the land had died (Exodus 12:23). The blood marked those inside as belonging to God. Rahab was a Gentile and a prostitute, but she, too, would be marked as one of God’s people. Though she was late to the party, so to speak, the “blood” of the scarlet cord would bring Rahab her own Passover moment.\n\nThe symbol, of course, is not as important as the thing it symbolizes. What set Rahab apart as a member of God’s family was not the red rope but her loyalty to Yahweh, based on the reports she had heard (Joshua 2:10–11). By helping the Israelites, she was committing treason, and she knew it. By earthly measures, the people of Jericho should have been able to withstand an attack by the Israelites. Rahab could have turned the spies over to the authorities and garnered herself the favor of Jericho’s king. But she believed what she had heard about the Lord, and she gave Him her allegiance, echoing with her life what the psalmist would later write: “The LORD is my portion” (Psalm 119:57).\n\nBut the scarlet cord doesn’t just point backwards to Passover; it also points forward to Christ. It is Christ’s red blood that now marks those who are members of God’s family. The Passover account had always foreshadowed the sacrifice of Jesus, and God had always planned on making one new people from Jews and Gentiles. Rahab’s story reveals this had long been in God’s heart to do. The prostitute-turned-daughter of the King is even honored with a place in Jesus’s family tree (Matthew 1:5).\n\nGod is the Author of Scripture. No detail is included by accident. Every last one is an invitation to thank Him for His faithfulness, our God who knows the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10).\n\nWritten by John Greco",

        "devo_summary": "One of my strongest memories from my sophomore year of high school is of a black, 5-inch thick three-ring binder I carried everywhere. I was part of the not-so-exclusive academic quiz bowl team at my school, and every few weeks, I would compete against other schools to see which team could “buzz in” first to earn points answering trivia questions. My binder was filled with the printed records of previous tournament questions and answers. Though questions were rarely repeated, I poured over that binder every opportunity I could find, hoping that my incessant studying might reveal recurring subject matter or a pattern in how questions are worded for tournaments to give me an edge over the competition. To this day, I’d still choose a trivia night at a local restaurant over almost any other activity.\n\nI used to think taking this same approach to Scripture was proof that I loved God’s Word. Studying the Bible—its words, history, cultural contexts, and languages—has been life-giving to my faith in my undergraduate and postgraduate studies, as well as in my career. But I have to be reminded that life as a follower of Jesus is so much more than just memorizing facts about God or storing up interesting trivia about the Bible. Our reading and study of Scripture should shape us and reorient our hearts as it shows us who He is and who we are in Him.\n\nI come back to the book of James over and over when I find my heart wanting to make a god of knowing about God, rather than truly knowing Him. The book is full of direct one-liners that cut right to the truth: truly delighting in God’s Word means living out what the Word teaches us. In the opening passage of his letter, James sums this up by telling believers that we must be “doers of the word and not hearers only” (James 1:22).\n\nHearing without acting is more than useless—it’s self-deception, because as believers, we are new people born of the gospel (v.22,18). James writes that God has implanted His Word in us (v.21). We miss the point if we are not willing to let its truth take root, growing and bearing fruit in us as we are changed and made more like Christ.\n\nEssentially, we are living out what the psalmist pleads with God to do: transform him so that he can keep God’s commands (Psalm 119:21). By His Spirit and His Word, we’ve been made into new people. Unlike the person who looks in the mirror and responds, “I forget,” when asked what they look like (vv.23–24), we are called to remember who we are as we walk away from reading the Bible. If we go about our lives without acting on what it teaches, we live as fractured people, at odds with who we now are in Christ. Praise God, because He’s done the hardest work in giving us new hearts already!\n\nBeing in the Word of God every day equips us to live out the Word of God every day. It guards against forgetting what is true of our God and of ourselves. Let our prayer echo that of the psalmist as we come to the Bible each day: ”Teach me, LORD, the meaning of your statutes, and I will always keep them” (Psalm 119:33).\n\nWritten by Jessica Lamb",

        "devo_summary": "In her essay called “The Wreck of Time,” Annie Dillard references the idea that when a single person dies, we treat it as a tragedy. But when a million people die, we treat it as a statistic.\n\nThis unsettling observation shows how inconsistent we humans can be concerning the value of a life. On the one hand, if a friend or relative or some other cherished person is taken from us, we are moved to deep and abiding sorrow. On the other hand, if a million lives with whom we share no personal connection are suddenly wiped out by a viral pandemic or natural disaster, any initial sadness and shock we feel can fade within weeks, and possibly within hours. The one who is close to us seems more precious even than the million who are further away.\n\nOur selective valuation of our fellow humans invites a haunting question: If the million don’t matter to us as much as the one, then can we honestly say that the one really matters at all? How precious are many lives, how precious is a single life, and how precious is my life… really?\n\nEach of us living today is one in seven billion. Of all the people who have ever lived, we are one in 107 billion. David hinted at this relative smallness of ours when he cried out to God, “What is a human being that you remember him, a son of man that you look after him?” (Psalm 8:4).\n\nThankfully, Scripture provides us with a strong and sure answer. David continued, “You made him a little less than God and crowned him with glory and honor” (v.5). The poet-king after God’s own heart is genuinely awestruck by the truth about all humans and about each individual human: We are made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). Of all creatures everywhere, only humans are esteemed in this way.\n\nThis truth about our inestimable value becomes even more compelling when we realize that in Christ, we are the image of God but also much more: Scripture tells us we are the children of God. And as His children, He gives us life through His Word and teaches us His ways (Psalm 119:25–26). In his letter to the Galatians, Paul amplifies this astonishing truth by reminding us that through faith in Christ, God has adopted us, sent His Spirit into our hearts, invited us to call Him “Father,” and made us heirs of all that is His (Galatians 4:4–7).\n\nAs Brennan Manning has written, “Define yourself radically as one beloved by God. This is the true self. Every other identity is an illusion.”\n\nThe next time you look in the mirror, don’t for a moment think that you’re looking at a mere face in the crowd. Don’t for a moment think that you’re looking at a tragedy or a statistic. You have no true basis for looking at yourself in this way. Rather, you are looking at an esteemed crown of God’s creation, a beloved child of God, and a privileged heir of everything.\n\nThis is your true self. Every other identity is an illusion.\n\nWritten by Scott Sauls",

        "devo_summary": "I used to really love the law (Exodus 20:1–17). I remember enthusiastically singing the Ten-Commandments song “The Perfect Ten” at school and church with the confidence of a child whose Christian walk was just beginning.\n\nNumber one, we’ve just begun: God should be first in your life!\n\nNumber two’s the idol rule: those graven images aren’t nice.\n\nI’d assure myself as I sang…\n\nNumber three: God’s name should be never spoken in jest.\n\nNumber four: the Sabbath’s for our worship and for rest.\n\nSo far, so good. Our family was known for nothing if not for our Sunday naps.\n\nNumber five: we all should strive to honor father and mother.\n\nNumber six: don’t get your kicks from killing one another.\n\nSuccess!\n\nNumber seven: life is heaven when you’re true to your mate.\n\nNumber eight: don’t steal and break this rule for goodness’ sake!\n\nNumber seven was easy—I didn’t even have a mate!\n\nNumber nine: don’t be the kind who goes around telling lies.\n\nNumber ten: don’t covet when you see your neighbor’s house or wife!\n\nI was doing so well. It had never occurred to me to covet my neighbor’s wife. In my mind I would sing that song with a full band playing behind me—like a victory song. I was delighting in God’s law because it was just so keepable! But as I grew to understand the law, I began to understand how difficult it was to follow.\n\nI thank God that He brought me out of the age of check, check, check into the maturity of, If this is the measuring stick, I will never measure up. And even more, I’m thankful He didn’t leave me there with my checklist. When God mercifully, gradually granted me eyes to see how readily I broke His law by commission, omission, and flat-out rejection of Him, the big band musicians in my head began to slowly lower their instruments and solemnly take their seats. I wasn’t delighting in God’s law at all. I had been delighting in my “keeping” of His law.\n\nBut my delight hasn’t gone away; it has instead shifted and matured. Now, my soul finds rest in knowing that the law has been fulfilled by Christ on my behalf. Because of Jesus, the law no longer justifies or condemns us—it frees us and becomes our guide for thankful obedience to the One by whom we are justified.\n\nDo you get that? If the law is our measuring stick, every one of us will be found unrighteous. But Jesus kept God’s law perfectly, imparting His righteousness to us so that when we are measured, we, too, will be counted as righteous—as perfect law-keepers!\n\nNow, when I catch myself humming that childhood ten commandments tune (or teaching it to my children), I hear it differently. Not as a reminder of what I have to do, or even as a condemnation of what I can’t do. I hear it now as an assurance of what He has done, and as the kindest, clearest roadmap to the heart of the Father. He makes me righteous, and I delight in pleasing Him. “Oh that my ways may be steadfast in keeping [His] statutes!” (Psalm 119:5, ESV).\n\nLord, I love your law. “With my lips I declare all the rules of your mouth” (v.13, ESV).\n\nWritten by Raechel Myers",

        "devo_summary": "Christians don’t just read the Bible. We enter into a life-long relationship with it. We read it over the course of a lifetime, knowing we will never exhaust all there is to know or glean from God’s Word. Often, when we return to passages we’ve read before, we come to them having changed since the last time we spent time with those verses. We go through things that shift how we see the world—vocational upheaval, marriage, divorce, parenthood, miscarriage, life-altering diagnoses, unexpected windfalls of good-fortune, and the like.\n\nAs we experience more of the joys and heartaches associated with living in this world, we look at Scripture through different eyes. Sometimes a theological idea we thought we had wrapped up in a tidy bow suddenly becomes shot through with questions we never thought to ask when we were younger and had not suffered much.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I am so drawn to the story of Peter’s reinstatement in John 21:1–19. Here we find Simon Peter, who was one of Jesus’s closest friends, sitting with the fact that he had denied Jesus in His greatest hour of need. He had done so exactly as Jesus predicted he would, even though he swore this sort of failure wasn’t something he was capable of (Mark 14:31).\n\nI love the story because it’s about someone who appeared to have as good of a relationship with Jesus as anyone could have, and yet he himself was weak. When Jesus appeared on the shore cooking breakfast for His friends, and caused their empty nets to be filled with more fish than they could handle, Peter recognized Jesus, because this is the same way Jesus first called Peter—with a miraculous catch of fish (Luke 5:1–11).\n\nWhen Peter jumped out of the boat and cast his drenched and dripping self at the feet of Jesus, he had no relational ground to stand on. He’d betrayed his best friend, his Lord. And yet, Jesus asked Peter the most simple and searching question imaginable: “Do you love me?” And Peter, paradox that he is, answered truthfully. He did love Jesus. He did. When Jesus said, “Feed my sheep,” He was hearkening back to when He first called Peter and told him He would make him a fisher of men. Peter’s failure did not disqualify him from Jesus’s love, or from Jesus’s call on his life.\n\nI love this passage because it offers so much hope to people who go through seasons of struggle and failure and wonder if they have lost the love of God. Peter could do nothing but receive from Jesus. On that shore, he had nothing to offer. And yet, he longed to be near his Lord and friend. We know this because earlier, before Jesus was crucified, He taught that people would ultimately need to be nourished by His flesh and blood. It was a teaching many found too difficult to embrace, and they left. But when Jesus asked His disciples if they, too, would leave, it was Peter who said, “Lord, to whom will we go? You have the words of eternal life” (John 6:68).\n\nPeter’s story reminds us that the thing we must cling to most, and fear above all else, is the Word of Christ (Psalm 119:161). Though our circumstances change, and even we change, He does not (Hebrews 13:8). Where else can we go?\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

        "devo_title": "I Have Not Forgotten Your Instruction",
        "devo_summary": "It was the first time I’d ever stood up in front of our church congregation, some fifteen years ago. Alongside our fellow “new members,” my husband and I looked out over the church body we were joining, as our pastor read our favorite Bible verses aloud and introduced us by name. Never one to go first, I listened from the end of the line as one inspirational verse after another was read into the microphone, each one offering another shade of affirmation, encouragement, and faith. But as I listened for the first time to the verses of other new congregants, I felt panic set in: Had I misunderstood the instruction? The sound of my blood pumping in my ears grew louder, nearly drowning out my pastor’s voice completely, until my husband gently squeezed my hand to hear my own “favorite verse” from Scripture:\n\n“There is nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work. \n\nI have seen that even this is from God’s hand, \n\nbecause who can eat and who can enjoy life apart from him?” (Ecclesiastes 2:24–25).\n\nYup.\n\nIn all of Scripture, with its sweeping poetry and prose, that was “my verse”—is my verse, I should say. In that moment of pride, I began to doubt my seemingly simple choice. I was afraid that, out of context, it misrepresented my faith and understanding of the gospel and downplayed my affection for God. I’ve since come to realize just how accurately it still reflects my relationship with Him and the sin that so often distracts me from Him: my heart’s unfortunate tendency to wander.\n\nI’m easily distracted, you see. By work. By striving. By perfectionism of the textbook-definition variety. And when I get caught up in working and worrying, spinning myself into a cycle that pushes God away from the center of my heart’s affections—that’s when He reminds me of what’s true. He gently squeezes my heart in such a way that I’m forced to acknowledge the emptiness I’m feeling, the deep ache I work so hard to numb with the distraction of productivity, when I try to live my life with my gaze affixed on anyone or anything “apart from him” (John 15:5).\n\nThe Westminster Shorter Catechism posits that “the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.” In my own walk with God, I’ve tended to focus on the first part, on what it might mean to glorify Him. I’ve twisted the idea of bearing His image into a works-based, legalistic, shallow religion that has very little to do with my God.\n\nBut to enjoy Him. To be satisfied in Him. To delight in His Word. To stop and savor His provision and the work He’s called me to, not just for what they might become in the future, but for what they are today—well, that sings of enjoying relationship with my very relational God, the one who is ready to answer when we call out to Him, when we seek Him with all our heart (Psalm 119:145). His Word is a very precious gift that instructs us on how to best live this life He’s given us (v.153). And it is clear: in knowing Him, being in His presence, there is abundant joy and eternal pleasure. But apart from Him, we will never be satisfied (Psalm 16:11). This is the instruction my wandering heart so desperately needs.\n\nWritten by Kara Gause",

        "devo_summary": "Reading the Bible has always been hard for me. That may sound strange coming from someone who works for a company with the motto, “Women in the Word of God every day.” Over the years, being in the Word has proved tricky for several reasons, one of which is its familiarity. I’ve read Scripture my whole life, yet the transformative stories and commands lose their potency when I grow used to their rhythms and cadence, to the way the words sound when they roll off my tongue.\n\nLet me be clear: Scripture can’t lose its power or potency. But I can diminish its work in my life through my own apathy. I can choose not to slow down and really open myself to the text or the Holy Spirit who speaks through it.\n\nA decade ago, I walked through a situation that required me to love a friend and leader in our church community with what the Bible calls agape love—a love that seeks someone else’s wellbeing. Since I could no longer speak with this person directly, the development of this love had to take place solely between God and me. So, my best friend and I made a pact to read 1 Corinthians 13 every day for a whole year. The love passage. This well-known chapter was the best model we could find for the altruistic, Christlike, agape kind of love.\n\nJust because it was a well-known chapter didn’t mean it was easy to put into action. By focusing our attention on one passage for an extended period of time, the purpose was long-term, personal transformation. I began reading it to myself out loud, as if to absorb into my very being. I can still hear the lines echoing through my car, as I read it aloud each morning:\n\n“Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not envy, \n\nis not boastful, is not arrogant, is not rude, \n\nis not self-seeking, is not irritable, \n\nand does not keep a record of wrongs” (1 Corinthians 13:4–5).\n\nThese aren’t just eloquent lines of verse or truisms to tuck away in our back pocket. They’re the living, active words of God. My friend and I didn’t set out to memorize the chapter, but within a couple weeks it was buried inside us. I found that my heart had been softened toward God’s Word and toward this person from our community. And even though it may not have redeemed the situation, it changed my heart.\n\nAs Psalm 119 says, “Your decrees are wondrous; therefore I obey them” (v.129). Let’s obey God’s decrees by burying them inside us, even if that means reciting them aloud for 365 days. When our hearts have a chance to catch up with our minds, we begin to embody truth and become not a clanging cymbal but a transformed child of God (1Corinthians 13:1).\n\nWritten by Bailey Gillespie",

        "devo_summary": "“Okay. What have you learned from this?”\n\nThis phrase, spoken by my father, was a mainstay of my growing up. I heard it one summer afternoon when I was eight years old, following my sheepish confession that I’d accidentally shot my neighbor, Mr. Horner, with my BB gun. I heard it late one snowy Michigan night, when my car came to rest against a chain-link fence—after I’d impatiently tried (unsuccessfully) to maneuver it between a ditch and another parked car in my girlfriend’s driveway—resulting in a phone call to my dad, asking him to come help me dig my car out of a snowdrift. And I’ve uttered that same question to myself countless times since, even as I’ve grown older and the learning opportunities have evolved with time and age.\n\nAlways spoken in love, and almost always received with humility, it’s a phrase so simple, yet it resounds with the essence of the relationship between a dad and a son. I’m deeply grateful to fall into the increasingly receding percentage of men whose fathers are truly fatherly.\n\nWe might not expect to find such a rare, human moment between father and son within Scripture. While God’s Word is relatable and relevant across time, I still struggle sometimes to grasp the idea that these words were written to real people who existed in a real time and place. But that wasn’t the case for me when I read David’s words to his son, Solomon, in 1 Chronicles 28. His words could’ve just as easily been written to me in a text message from my dad on any given Monday morning:\n\n“As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, \n\nand serve him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind, \n\nfor the LORD searches every heart and understands the intention of every thought.\n\nIf you seek him, he will be found by you” (v.9).\n\nI can almost picture the memories and hard-won lessons flashing before David’s eyes as he distills his life into just two simple sentences, passing down parting wisdom to his son. After charging Solomon with the great responsibility of building the temple and outlining the requirements of the job, David’s parting words to his son, and some of his last we read in the Bible, include loving encouragement that ultimately points Solomon to a present, secure, steadfast God. He tells Solomon to “be strong and courageous, and do the work… for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He won’t leave you or abandon you until all the work for the service of the LORD’s house is finished” (v.20).\n\nWhat a delight it is to be offered wisdom by those who’ve come before us, and in turn, to offer guidance to those who will come after us. But isn’t that what this entire book, the Bible, is about? It’s a lamp to lead our feet along the path of life (Psalm 119:105). It gives guidance from a loving Father through stories of His own and others’ that are full of grace and love, that shape us and call us to grow. May we honor the same Father of David and Solomon, feel loved by Him, and love like Him every day.\n\nWritten by Ryan Myers",

        "devo_summary": "His photo was taped to my computer monitor at work and to the refrigerator door at home—a three-year-old boy with olive skin, black hair, deep brown eyes, and a dimple above each cheek. He was a child of God with no earthly mama or baba to call his own, and I wanted so badly for him to be ours.\n\nI’ve said that adoption feels as miraculous as childbirth, a million little pieces that must fall perfectly into place for that blessed homecoming to occur. It seemed all but impossible in the beginning—too much paperwork, too much money, too many unknowns. And then there was his heart. This image-bearer was created by God with a very special heart, one that somehow managed to channel blood throughout his small frame despite missing some very important vessels. He’s been a miracle from the start.\n\nSomewhere in those early days of wondering if this beautiful, brokenhearted boy could be our son, I read a passage from Isaiah 41 that made my own heart beat loud and fast.\n\n“I am the LORD, the God of Israel. I will not abandon them… \n\nI will open rivers on the barren heights, and springs in the middle of the plains. \n\nI will turn the desert into a pool and dry land into springs… \n\nSo that all may see and know, consider and understand, \n\nthat the hand of the LORD has done this, \n\nthe Holy One of Israel has created it” (Isaiah 41:17–18,20).\n\nI taped those words to my computer monitor, right next to that dimpled smile. It was a promise from God to His people, and it became my prayer in the joy and hope and helplessness of the days and months ahead.\n\nLord, do what we cannot. Be who we cannot. Create vessels where there are none, and a road home for this boy of ours, if indeed he’s ours. Create what only you can create, as only You can. May all who see it know that You and You alone bring life and hope.\n\nPsalm 119:89 says that God’s Word is forever, “firmly fixed in heaven.” But the concept of an unbreakable thing is difficult to understand when you yourself are broken. The idea that something lasts forever feels like fiction when the world we live in is filled with people, places, and promises that fade. But God’s Word is both unbreakable and everlasting. Tethering my heart to it changes the way I walk through this wounded, temporary world. So, I grabbed hold of that Isaiah passage, and I still haven’t let it go.\n\nOur son did come home, despite all the obstacles. And after his first heart catheterization here, the surgeon showed us images we’d prayed for, but never dreamed we’d see: vessels where there once were none, tangible hope created from nothing. But would God have been good if that catheterization had found nothing new, no surgical path forward? A resounding, Yes. Because our hope is not in healed hearts or an oasis planted in the desert; our hope is in the One who speaks arteries and myrtle trees into existence, whose Word never fades or fails, even when our bodies most certainly will.\n\nThose verses I stared at day after day in that season—the same ones I clung to by his hospital bed in the year that followed—do not guarantee an outcome. They guarantee God’s goodness. He is bigger than outcomes, even when our circumstances shift and our hearts ache. We can trust the God who makes all things new.\n\nWritten by Amanda Bible Williams",

        "devo_summary": "I grew up going to church three times a week and met some of my closest friends (even to this day!) in youth group. Most of my Facebook statuses in high school were inspirational Bible verses that I hoped would encourage my friends at my public high school who weren’t believers. I went to a Christian university for my undergraduate degree, where mandatory chapel was held twice a week, and every student was required to take six semesters worth of Bible classes. I interned at a local church and even earned a minor degree in the Bible. And then, I went to graduate divinity school.\n\nBut somewhere along the way, I stopped delighting in Scripture. I saw it as something to be studied, but not something to be taken to heart. I began to think of God as something to learn about rather than someone to know. To date, this was one of the most confusing times in my life so far.\n\nAfter a time spent in this confusing season, I was given a special project at work; I was instructed to go through the entire book of Genesis, chapter by chapter, writing discussion questions along the way for kids aged eleven to fifteen.\n\nI don’t know the last time you read through the book of Genesis (maybe in January when we read it together, as a community), but there are some stories in that book that are, well, a little less than age-appropriate for young teens. As I was going through some of the trickier passages, the discussion point I kept coming back to was that God keeps His promises to His people. His people keep turning away from Him, not believing Him, disobeying Him and turning to other gods, but God is consistently faithful to His promises.\n\nOne of the passages that fell into this category was the story of Sarah and her pregnancy with Isaac. When God told her she would become pregnant in her old age, Sarah laughed at the very thought (Genesis 18:9–15). But God kept His promise to her, and she bore a son (Genesis 21:1–7). After reading and working through the rest of the book of Genesis, I went into my friend’s office exasperated and frustrated with myself because I couldn’t find anything else for the discussion questions. She encouraged me to keep at it and do my best, and reassured me that maybe it was okay if God keeping His promises was the main theme of the project.\n\nSoon after completing the project, I realized that what had been frustrating me about the book of Genesis was exactly what I needed to hear and understand about God in a season of my own confusion and doubt: God keeps His promises to His people. He keeps His promises when your world seems to come crashing down. He keeps His promises when your best friend betrays you, when a dear family member falls ill, when the plans you had for your life have suddenly fallen to pieces around you. I know He does because I’ve seen it in my own life. His promises to His people are true. We can put our hope in Him to do so (Psalm 119:81). What a beautiful gift.\n\nWritten by Ellen Taylor",

        "devo_summary": "I remember listening to journalist Malcolm Gladwell interview Nashville legend and famed songwriter Bobby Braddock. Their conversation centered on what goes into writing a truly sad song, the kind of tune that finds you driving with one hand on the steering wheel so the other can be free to wipe the tears from your eyes.\n\nAs they talked, they decided that country music has a leg up on rock and pop when it comes to mournful tracks, but the question that lingered was Why? In the end, Braddock said it came down to details: “We cry when melancholy collides with specificity.” It’s one thing to sing about heartache, and another thing entirely to sing about standing by a lost friend’s grave and the angels’ faces delighting to welcome that friend home. Take a listen to “Go Rest High on That Mountain” by Vince Gill to hear what I’m talking about.\n\nThe reason that details help sad songs resonate with us is because they echo our own experience. We live in a world of details, not generalities. Somehow, the details make a thing more real. When it comes to God’s Word, I delight in the details. You see, in the ancient world, there was no paper. Instead, texts were written on papyrus, a material similar to paper but made out of certain flattened reeds—and papyrus wasn’t cheap. That means that everything included in God’s Word is important. There are no throwaway lines, no unimportant details.\n\nIn the story of Rahab, there’s a detail that jumps off the page for me. When she lets the two Israelite spies down through her window, she does so with a “scarlet cord” (Joshua 2:18). And it was this scarlet cord that would identify her home and keep her safe when the Israelites later attacked Jericho. It wasn’t brown or blue or white. It was a scarlet rope—and that makes all the difference in telling this story.\n\nFor those early Israelite readers of Rahab’s account, they would have connected the red color of the rope “dripping” down the window frame with the lamb’s blood a previous generation had brushed on the doorframes of their homes. While still slaves in Egypt, God had passed over the houses of the Hebrews on the night the firstborn in every household in the land had died (Exodus 12:23). The blood marked those inside as belonging to God. Rahab was a Gentile and a prostitute, but she, too, would be marked as one of God’s people. Though she was late to the party, so to speak, the “blood” of the scarlet cord would bring Rahab her own Passover moment.\n\nThe symbol, of course, is not as important as the thing it symbolizes. What set Rahab apart as a member of God’s family was not the red rope but her loyalty to Yahweh, based on the reports she had heard (Joshua 2:10–11). By helping the Israelites, she was committing treason, and she knew it. By earthly measures, the people of Jericho should have been able to withstand an attack by the Israelites. Rahab could have turned the spies over to the authorities and garnered herself the favor of Jericho’s king. But she believed what she had heard about the Lord, and she gave Him her allegiance, echoing with her life what the psalmist would later write: “The LORD is my portion” (Psalm 119:57).\n\nBut the scarlet cord doesn’t just point backwards to Passover; it also points forward to Christ. It is Christ’s red blood that now marks those who are members of God’s family. The Passover account had always foreshadowed the sacrifice of Jesus, and God had always planned on making one new people from Jews and Gentiles. Rahab’s story reveals this had long been in God’s heart to do. The prostitute-turned-daughter of the King is even honored with a place in Jesus’s family tree (Matthew 1:5).\n\nGod is the Author of Scripture. No detail is included by accident. Every last one is an invitation to thank Him for His faithfulness, our God who knows the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10).\n\nWritten by John Greco",

Though questions were rarely repeated, I poured over that binder every opportunity I could find, hoping that my incessant studying might reveal recurring subject matter or a pattern in how questions are worded for tournaments to give me an edge over the competition. To this day, I’d still choose a trivia night at a local restaurant over almost any other activity.\n\nI used to think taking this same approach to Scripture was proof that I loved God’s Word. Studying the Bible—its words, history, cultural contexts, and languages—has been life-giving to my faith in my undergraduate and postgraduate studies, as well as in my career. But I have to be reminded that life as a follower of Jesus is so much more than just memorizing facts about God or storing up interesting trivia about the Bible. Our reading and study of Scripture should shape us and reorient our hearts as it shows us who He is and who we are in Him.\n\nI come back to the book of James over and over when I find my heart wanting to make a god of knowing about God, rather than truly knowing Him. The book is full of direct one-liners that cut right to the truth: truly delighting in God’s Word means living out what the Word teaches us. In the opening passage of his letter, James sums this up by telling believers that we must be “doers of the word and not hearers only” (James 1:22).\n\nHearing without acting is more than useless—it’s self-deception, because as believers, we are new people born of the gospel (v.22,18). James writes that God has implanted His Word in us (v.21). We miss the point if we are not willing to let its truth take root, growing and bearing fruit in us as we are changed and made more like Christ.\n\nEssentially, we are living out what the psalmist pleads with God to do: transform him so that he can keep God’s commands (Psalm 119:21). By His Spirit and His Word, we’ve been made into new people. Unlike the person who looks in the mirror and responds, “I forget,” when asked what they look like (vv.23–24), we are called to remember who we are as we walk away from reading the Bible. If we go about our lives without acting on what it teaches, we live as fractured people, at odds with who we now are in Christ. Praise God, because He’s done the hardest work in giving us new hearts already!\n\nBeing in the Word of God every day equips us to live out the Word of God every day. It guards against forgetting what is true of our God and of ourselves. Let our prayer echo that of the psalmist as we come to the Bible each day: ”Teach me, LORD, the meaning of your statutes, and I will always keep them” (Psalm 119:33).\n\nWritten by Jessica Lamb",

        "devo_summary": "In her essay called “The Wreck of Time,” Annie Dillard references the idea that when a single person dies, we treat it as a tragedy. But when a million people die, we treat it as a statistic.\n\nThis unsettling observation shows how inconsistent we humans can be concerning the value of a life. On the one hand, if a friend or relative or some other cherished person is taken from us, we are moved to deep and abiding sorrow. On the other hand, if a million lives with whom we share no personal connection are suddenly wiped out by a viral pandemic or natural disaster, any initial sadness and shock we feel can fade within weeks, and possibly within hours. The one who is close to us seems more precious even than the million who are further away.\n\nOur selective valuation of our fellow humans invites a haunting question: If the million don’t matter to us as much as the one, then can we honestly say that the one really matters at all? How precious are many lives, how precious is a single life, and how precious is my life… really?\n\nEach of us living today is one in seven billion. Of all the people who have ever lived, we are one in 107 billion. David hinted at this relative smallness of ours when he cried out to God, “What is a human being that you remember him, a son of man that you look after him?” (Psalm 8:4).\n\nThankfully, Scripture provides us with a strong and sure answer. David continued, “You made him a little less than God and crowned him with glory and honor” (v.5). The poet-king after God’s own heart is genuinely awestruck by the truth about all humans and about each individual human: We are made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). Of all creatures everywhere, only humans are esteemed in this way.\n\nThis truth about our inestimable value becomes even more compelling when we realize that in Christ, we are the image of God but also much more: Scripture tells us we are the children of God. And as His children, He gives us life through His Word and teaches us His ways (Psalm 119:25–26). In his letter to the Galatians, Paul amplifies this astonishing truth by reminding us that through faith in Christ, God has adopted us, sent His Spirit into our hearts, invited us to call Him “Father,” and made us heirs of all that is His (Galatians 4:4–7).\n\nAs Brennan Manning has written, “Define yourself radically as one beloved by God. This is the true self. Every other identity is an illusion.”\n\nThe next time you look in the mirror, don’t for a moment think that you’re looking at a mere face in the crowd. Don’t for a moment think that you’re looking at a tragedy or a statistic. You have no true basis for looking at yourself in this way. Rather, you are looking at an esteemed crown of God’s creation, a beloved child of God, and a privileged heir of everything.\n\nThis is your true self. Every other identity is an illusion.\n\nWritten by Scott Sauls",

        "devo_summary": "I used to really love the law (Exodus 20:1–17). I remember enthusiastically singing the Ten-Commandments song “The Perfect Ten” at school and church with the confidence of a child whose Christian walk was just beginning.\n\nNumber one, we’ve just begun: God should be first in your life!\n\nNumber two’s the idol rule: those graven images aren’t nice.\n\nI’d assure myself as I sang…\n\nNumber three: God’s name should be never spoken in jest.\n\nNumber four: the Sabbath’s for our worship and for rest.\n\nSo far, so good. Our family was known for nothing if not for our Sunday naps.\n\nNumber five: we all should strive to honor father and mother.\n\nNumber six: don’t get your kicks from killing one another.\n\nSuccess!\n\nNumber seven: life is heaven when you’re true to your mate.\n\nNumber eight: don’t steal and break this rule for goodness’ sake!\n\nNumber seven was easy—I didn’t even have a mate!\n\nNumber nine: don’t be the kind who goes around telling lies.\n\nNumber ten: don’t covet when you see your neighbor’s house or wife!\n\nI was doing so well. It had never occurred to me to covet my neighbor’s wife. In my mind I would sing that song with a full band playing behind me—like a victory song. I was delighting in God’s law because it was just so keepable! But as I grew to understand the law, I began to understand how difficult it was to follow.\n\nI thank God that He brought me out of the age of check, check, check into the maturity of, If this is the measuring stick, I will never measure up. And even more, I’m thankful He didn’t leave me there with my checklist. When God mercifully, gradually granted me eyes to see how readily I broke His law by commission, omission, and flat-out rejection of Him, the big band musicians in my head began to slowly lower their instruments and solemnly take their seats. I wasn’t delighting in God’s law at all. I had been delighting in my “keeping” of His law.\n\nBut my delight hasn’t gone away; it has instead shifted and matured. Now, my soul finds rest in knowing that the law has been fulfilled by Christ on my behalf. Because of Jesus, the law no longer justifies or condemns us—it frees us and becomes our guide for thankful obedience to the One by whom we are justified.\n\nDo you get that? If the law is our measuring stick, every one of us will be found unrighteous. But Jesus kept God’s law perfectly, imparting His righteousness to us so that when we are measured, we, too, will be counted as righteous—as perfect law-keepers!\n\nNow, when I catch myself humming that childhood ten commandments tune (or teaching it to my children), I hear it differently. Not as a reminder of what I have to do, or even as a condemnation of what I can’t do. I hear it now as an assurance of what He has done, and as the kindest, clearest roadmap to the heart of the Father. He makes me righteous, and I delight in pleasing Him. “Oh that my ways may be steadfast in keeping [His] statutes!” (Psalm 119:5, ESV).\n\nLord, I love your law. “With my lips I declare all the rules of your mouth” (v.13, ESV).\n\nWritten by Raechel Myers",

    "devo_title": "Philemon & Onesimus",
    "devo_summary": "The gospel tells us who we are to each other. The relationship between Philemon and Onesimus drives this point home by way of a fascinating bit of drama.\n\nOnesimus, Philemon’s runaway slave, was from Colossae, and he was one of the people who delivered Paul’s letter to the Colossians. We know this because in Colossians, Paul writes to the church there:\n\n“I have sent [Tychicus] to you… so that you may know how we are and so that he may encourage your hearts. He is coming with Onesimus, a faithful and dearly loved brother, who is one of you” (Colossians 4:7–9, emphasis mine).\n\nThen, when we read the opening verses of Philemon, we discover that the church in Onesimus’s hometown, Colossae, met in Philemon’s house (Philemon 2). This means that when Tychicus stepped into the church in Colossae, he was actually standing in Philemon’s home. And who stood beside him? Onesimus, who had likely stolen from Philemon to fund his escape. Philemon 10–16 tells us Paul sent Onesimus back to Philemon for the purpose of reconciliation.\n\nConsider the drama of this moment. There would’ve been no notice of Tychicus’s and Onesimus’s arrival beforehand, just the sight of them. Imagine as they presented the two letters from Paul: one to the Colossian church that met in Philemon’s home, and the other a bit of personal correspondence from the apostle to Philemon about the prodigal standing there before him.\n\nPhilemon had his runaway slave right there in front of him, reminding him of the way Onesimus had wronged him, and yet he also had Paul’s words telling him Onesimus was a changed man, and that the two of them had become brothers in Christ. The gospel had reshaped their relationship already.\n\nPaul reminds Philemon of the truth of the transforming power of God’s grace at work in his life before he asks Philemon to now live by it (Philemon 4–7). The whole point of the gospel is that when Christ is the Lord of our lives, everything changes: how we see each other, how we react to those who have wronged us, and even what we should demand of them. This is hard, though, isn’t it? We often want to hold on to the ways we’ve been wronged. Why do we do that? If we are in Christ, the gospel overrules any other definition we may have of who we are to each other.\n\nFor love’s sake, Onesimus and Paul agreed Onesimus needed to be reconciled to Philemon. As his drive to escape led Onesimus to flee 1,200 miles to get away from Philemon, the drive to be reconciled now set him on a 1,200-mile return. But it wasn’t just Onesimus who needed to be set free. Paul would’ve been glad to keep him around, but there was a debt they owed Philemon. They owed it to Philemon to invite him to receive Onesimus as a brother. They couldn’t withhold this.\n\nForgiveness is the work of liberation. Every one of us has, at one time or another, been enslaved by someone else’s anger, bitterness, or disappointment, just as we have taken others captive by our own. This is where forgiveness comes in. To forgive is not merely to dismiss an offense. It is to release someone that we might both live in freedom.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

    "devo_title": "Timothy",
    "devo_summary": "What is your secret to success? I sometimes think my small successes come from my patience or my skill, or my grand intellect. The world applauds us and tells us that the road to personal success starts with our own bootstraps. But it just doesn’t ring true. While we certainly ought to be industrious and wise, genuine success isn’t rooted in ourselves. The only path to true and lasting success is found in the person of Christ.\n\nTimothy struggled with the issues of being a young minister in the church. Did he face parishioners who did not respect him because of his youth? Did he doubt his own calling and capability to fulfill it? Either way, Scripture clearly reveals that Timothy did not fix his hopes on his own talents, nor did Paul, his mentor and friend.\n\nPaul doesn’t comfort Timothy by saying “You’ve got this! You are worthy! You can do it!” His appeal isn’t to Timothy’s own abilities or personality at all. Rather, he simply calls Timothy to remain steadfast in faith, to commit himself to the faithful teaching of the Word, to hold on to the gospel. When the Word of truth is at the center, our age and confidence don’t matter. How others perceive us does not matter. We are called to preach only one thing: Christ, and Him crucified (1Corinthians 2:2). This is the true mark of ministry. It isn’t charisma, a nice personality, slick programs, or an impressive resumé. It is simply devotion to the gospel, to the Word, to Christ. And this comes only by the work of the Spirit.\n\nIndeed, Paul’s commendation of Timothy is always on this ground. He recognizes in Timothy the work of the Spirit, because he sees the genuineness of Timothy’s faith, which he has maintained since his youth. Furthermore, Timothy had proven himself a faithful minister as he served with Paul in the mission field. Timothy serves as a reminder of undistracted devotion to Christ.\n\nA second feature of Timothy’s ministry with Paul is its deeply personal nature. Note how often Paul addresses Timothy in familial and affectionate terms: he calls Timothy a “dearly loved” and “faithful child in the Lord” (2Timothy 1:2; 1Corinthians 4:17), a “brother” and “God’s co-worker” in the faith (1Thessalonians 3:2). His relationship to Timothy is one that fills him with thanksgiving and great joy (2Timothy 1:3–4), and has the quality of intimate kinship (Philippians 2:22). This, too, is a mark of the impact of the gospel. While it is true that “all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ” (v.21), we see that Timothy, shaped by the gospel, has become like-minded with Paul, genuinely caring about the interests of the flock (v.20).\n\nTimothy’s life and ministry are a reminder of what it looks like to serve the gospel and what it means to be a child of God. Just as Timothy devoted himself to the Word and ministry and a heartfelt faith, serving with Paul “like a son with a father,” so should we walk before Christ, walking with the ministers of the gospel in our own time. Christ has accomplished for us the work of salvation, that we might be fellow heirs with Him, children of God (Romans 8:17). So then, brothers, let us walk as children of God, in sincere devotion to the faith.\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires",

    "devo_title": "Priscilla & Aquila",
    "devo_summary": "Have you ever had a Priscilla or Aquila in your life? A godly older couple or mentor who knew the way of God and wanted to share it with you? It takes a lot of patience and humility to helpfully share what you know about “the way of God” (Acts 18:26). Some folks have a great deal of theoretical knowledge about the way of God, but don’t have the heart or the time to make an investment. Others are so intently walking the way of God (a good thing) that they forget to pause and invest in others along the way. Still others haven’t matured enough spiritually to start making those investments.\n\nA Priscilla-and-Aquila relationship is rare to come by. If you have the opportunity for spiritual mentorship of that kind, Scripture encourages it and affirms it—and you should certainly take advantage of it. On the other hand, it’s possible that God is calling you to be a spiritual mentor, to actively disciple a friend or acquaintance from church or your community. Is there someone that He may be asking you to take aside and explain the way of God?\n\nOne key approach that we can learn from these godly leaders in Acts is that “they invited [Apollos] to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately” (Acts 18:26, NIV). For these two, discipleship and spiritual investment started with hospitality. The old adage is true here when applied to spiritual growth: “People don’t care how much you know, until they know how much you care.”\n\nPriscilla and Aquila made a kingdom investment through a simple act of hospitality and friendship. From the comfort of their home, they carefully explained the scriptures to Apollos, who became one of the greatest teachers and preachers of his day.\n\nIt’s worth noting that while it’s debated by biblical scholars, Apollos is thought by some to be the writer of the book of Hebrews. Now, if that were true, it only amplifies the impact of this couple’s discipleship of Cornelius. Can you imagine? I doubt Priscilla and Aquila ever expected that sort of canonical ripple effect. They were simply loving their brother in faith well, while protecting the integrity of the gospel.\n\nIt just goes to show that you may never really know the full impact of a discipleship investment you make in another. Let’s make sure we are faithful in taking advantage of every opportunity that God places in our path to be discipled and offer discipleship in this frenetic age. It requires intentionality and a slowing of pace, but the impact is immeasurable.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard",

    "devo_summary": "My wife and I share a favorite word for our children’s arguments: snit. It perfectly captures the pettiness of so many little squabbles. We love our children very much, and we’ve spent the last thirteen years shepherding their hearts and minds. But with six kids we cannot get involved in every disagreement. And when it’s on the level of a snit, we rely on them to solve it on their own.\n\nDo you imagine that James and Jesus got into snits? If so, that must have been incredibly exasperating for James, because he would’ve been the only one bringing the snittiness to the conflict—Jesus was never at fault (2Corinthians 5:21).\n\nThe Bible doesn’t tell us much of Christ’s childhood, nor of the younger years of sibling relations, but during His early ministry we catch a glimpse of conflict. His siblings, who had grown up with Him, were at odds with Jesus’s bold claims. “He’s out of His mind,” they declared to the crowd, and sought to pull him aside (Mark 3:21). What else could they do to restrain their eccentric and possibly deluded brother? This was no longer a snit, after all, and I reckon James thought Jesus the one at fault.\n\nWhen James came to faith, following his brother’s resurrection, all signs of a possible rivalry and opposition disappeared. His epistle, which was the first letter written of the New Testament letters, is not focused on himself or his biological connection to Jesus, but rather on the marks of true faith. His call was to “pure and undefiled religion” (James 1:27), to a faith that was not mere lip-service.\n\nLike Christ’s exposition of the law in His Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7), James’s epistle reminds us that the call to faith in Christ is not shallow and promiscuous, allowing us to snag salvation and then go about our merry way. Rather, faith in Christ is transforming. The power of the “implanted word” produces not only salvation, but good works; it opens our ears to hear, and shapes our will to do the work of the kingdom (James 1:21).\n\nWe are prone to make a religion of our own design, to tell ourselves that our version of faith is genuine and pleasing to God. But James reminds us that neither a mere outward show of faith, nor a faith without outward results is genuine. In the first chapter alone, James reminds us that true Christianity is marked by wisdom, genuine faith, humility, endurance, gratitude, self control, making us doers of the Word, upholders of the law, servants to the needy, and set apart from the world (James 1:5–27).\n\nJames’s own life was a record of the gospel’s transformative power. He once was offended by Jesus, and prone to his own kind of “envy and selfish ambition” (James 3:16), even pronouncing Jesus insane (Mark 3:21). What a glorious testimony to the power of the gospel! As we look at the life of James, we are met with the evidence of God’s grace, which transforms unbelief to firm faith, and petty ridicule to a thirst for righteousness. May God be so gracious to us also, that we may be increasingly conformed to the image of Christ.\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires",

    "devo_title": "Cornelius",
    "devo_summary": "Cornelius’s conversion was no ordinary conversion. It symbolized the reach of the gospel to the Gentile world. Cornelius was a devout Gentile man who loved God. He was a centurion who used his power to care for Jewish people in his area. One day while he was praying, an angel of the Lord came to him and told him to send for Simon Peter, who was staying in a town not far away.\n\nPerhaps the greatest significance to Cornelius’s story in Scripture is the impact it had on Peter’s ministry as an apostle. The Lord had called Peter to be His witness in the world, commissioning him to proclaim a gospel that was meant to go out through Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria, to “the ends of the earth” —meaning the Gentile world (Acts 1:8).\n\nIn those days, the line was clearly drawn between Jews and Gentiles. They were separated not only by belief, but by ceremony, diet, and a range of other religious and cultural practices. It would have been hard for even the most enlightened Jew to imagine full-on fellowship with Gentiles. And yet salvation in Christ was offered fully and equally to them both. Simon Peter would play a key role in the gospel reaching beyond the Hebrew people, and Cornelius would be the Gentile to receive the gospel from him.\n\nAs Cornelius’s servants were on their way to get the apostle, Peter had a vision of all kinds of clean and unclean animals being lowered in a sheet. The Lord said, “Get up, Peter; kill and eat” (Acts 10:13). Peter was incredulous. Never in his life would he defile himself in this way, by partaking of what was unclean. But the Lord said, “‘What God has made clean, do not call impure.’ This happened three times, and suddenly the object was taken up into heaven” (vv.15–16).\n\nThis vision was about more than food. It was about Cornelius, and by extension, the entire Gentile world. The Lord was using Cornelius to teach Peter how to take the gospel beyond his own people, and how to regard them as clean. After Peter’s vision, Cornelius’s servants arrived and asked him to come to Cornelius’s house to proclaim the gospel to them.\n\nWhile Peter was preaching to Cornelius’s family, the Holy Spirit came down in a way that was similar to Pentecost. In both cases, the Holy Spirit descended on everyone present, and they all understood each other, even though people were speaking in different languages (Acts 2:6, 10:46). God’s Holy Spirit saw no distinction between Jews and Gentiles, and here was the proof.\n\nWe see in the text that Peter struggled a little to believe what God was doing. He was still learning. Peter believed Gentiles could be saved without first converting to Judaism. But with Cornelius, he witnessed it firsthand, and it astonished him. God was expanding Peter’s understanding of the breadth and scope of His saving grace. And it all came back to one basic need every single person who has ever lived shares: the need for peace with God, which is accomplished alone through Jesus Christ. May God always expand our view of His grace, our love for the lost, and our passion for His presence.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

    "devo_summary": "Would you rather be known for the things you did or the things that were done for you? My guess is that most men, particularly in the West, would rather be known for the legacy we’ve left. We’d prefer that people remember us for the things we accomplished professionally, socially, or even in ministry. It sounds weak, deflating, or even (dare I say) “unmanly” to be known for the ways in which we were dependent on others to help us.\n\nTabitha’s story should cause us to reconsider this posture. Today’s passage tells us that Tabitha was “always doing good works and acts of charity” (Acts 9:36). She was known for what she did within the community. I can imagine when people talked about her, it was always with esteem and honor. Yet biblically she’s not known as much for what she did, as much as what was done for her.\n\nWhen we encounter Tabitha’s story, we realize we’ve encountered a corpse. She’s dead! The apostle Peter happens to be in town, and through the powerful work of the Spirit of God in him, Tabitha is raised to life again. “This became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord” (Acts 9:42). She was returned from the grave to life, able to continue on “doing good works and acts of charity.” And that’s her story in Scripture.\n\nIt’s our story as well. Our reading in Ephesians today tells us that we were in the same condition: spiritually dead. There was no spiritual life happening, no resolute will we could exercise, no power we could employ to lift our hand to God and get His attention. We were dead in our trespasses and sins. “But God, who is rich in mercy,” raised us to life again by his grace (Ephesians 2:4). He came to us, as if we were dead on our backs, and breathed new life into us that can never be taken away.\n\nSome men try to live life seeking to be known for what they’ve done. Spiritually speaking, that won’t work with God. Because of our stone-cold-dead spiritual hearts, we have no good works. We have no deeds that will earn us God’s attention and favor. The argument of, “Look what I’ve done to enter heaven,” is not enough. Dead men don’t do works of any kind.\n\nYet for those who, like Tabitha, are known by what God has done for us, we’ll find the joyful embrace of our Father in heaven. All we must do is trust His Word and the promises He’s made within it. Everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ will be saved. Everyone who turns to Him by faith—not their own deeds—but by faith in Christ’s deeds, will be raised to life again one day.\n\nSo today, trust Christ. Turn from your sin, embrace Jesus by faith, and be raised to life spiritually to be full of good works and acts of charity that glorify Him. Those who are raised alive in Christ are God’s “workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do” (Ephesians 2:10).\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol",

    "devo_summary": "Is there someone in your life you pray would experience the transforming power of the gospel—peace with God, a clear conscience, and a sense of purpose and hope? Have you ever doubted such a transformation could be possible for someone whose heart was so hard toward God that all they felt toward the Church was hate?\n\nJesus can reach even the hardest heart, and we need look no further than the story of the apostle Paul for proof. Paul didn’t just oppose Jesus; he wanted to see everyone who preached about Him die. We’re talking about more than mere desire here. Paul got permission from the religious authorities to hunt down Christians and oversee their trials, which would end in martyrdom. Paul made it his mission to rid the earth of the Body of Christ.\n\nAs Paul was on his way to Damascus to arrest Christians, Jesus appeared to him on the road and struck him blind. As Paul groped around in the dark, Jesus said, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” (Acts 9:4). In response, Paul asked, “Who are you, Lord?” and after Jesus revealed Himself, He told Paul to go into the city, where he would be told what to do (vv.5–6).\n\nWhat did the Lord want Paul to do? He wanted him to become His apostle to the Gentile world. And that is just what happened. Paul gave the rest of his life, until his death at the hands of Rome, to proclaiming Christ, establishing churches in Galatia, Philippi, Thessalonica, Corinth, Colossae, Ephesus, and many other cities and villages throughout the Roman Empire.\n\nJesus didn’t just transform Paul from someone who persecuted the Church to someone who didn’t. He took this man who was so singularly devoted to the Church’s destruction and made him into a man who would play a greater role in expanding the Church than anyone else from his era.\n\nI have people I pray for every day, asking the Lord to transform their hearts and open their eyes to His grace. And if I’m honest, sometimes I feel like my prayers are asking too much. But when I look at the life of the apostle Paul—the author of Galatians, Colossians, Romans, Ephesians, and many other books in the New Testament—I see the power of Christ at work in the life of a man whose heart was as hard as they come. So I pray again, because if the Lord can transform a man like Paul as He did, He can do the same for anyone. He has even done it for me.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

    "devo_summary": "My best friend’s mom (let’s call her “Debbie”) gave me my first Bible on my sixteenth birthday. At the time, I was pretty skeptical about this Jesus character, and I was seeking answers to life’s questions anywhere and everywhere—except the Bible. I was pretty confused by her present, and to tell the truth, I would’ve preferred a gift certificate to a local music store where, yes, physical copies of CDs and cassettes are sold. (Remember those?) But I’m not a monster, so I thanked her for the gift and promised to look through it with an open mind. Over the next several years, she would answer my many questions about the Bible, describing for me the power and beauty of Jesus Christ.\n\nDebbie welcomed me into her home day after day as one of her own, and almost twenty-five years later, she still refers to herself as my “other mother.” Even then, she loved me in spite of my flaws and many mistakes, meeting me right where I was, and from there, walking beside me through some really difficult times. Because of her indefatigable love and compassion, I trusted her, and it’s because of my trust in Debbie that I was willing to crack open that Bible and see what I could find. Indeed, I found everything.\n\nWhen a person of mighty faith encounters someone whose heart is open to the possibility of God’s presence, amazing things happen. All it takes is patience, trust, love—and listening to the call of the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:29). Like Philip in today’s passage, Debbie was obedient to God’s calling, she trusted Him to open my eyes to His Word, and she loved me despite the obstacles of my skepticism and confusion about God. Like the Ethiopian official, I was willing to ask for help. In other words, she showed up, and because of the trust she engendered in me, I let her in.\n\nIn today’s passage we learn that “Philip proceeded to tell [the Ethiopian official] the good news about Jesus, beginning with [the] Scripture” he’d been reading when Philip met him (Acts 8:35, 32–33). We should note that Philip didn’t launch into some pre-packaged speech, but instead began their conversation with the very Scripture that was giving the Ethiopian official some trouble, meeting him right where he was on his own faith journey. Philip put aside any agenda he may have had and let the Holy Spirit guide him through what I imagine was a beautiful exposition of God’s love illustrated by the good news about Jesus. The Ethiopian official certainly seems to have responded favorably to Philip’s patient explanation given that he asked Philip to baptize him right there on the spot, at the first sight of water (Acts 8:36). What a powerful and intimate moment, that God’s love would be on grand display as one man welcomed another out of the darkness and into the marvelous light of God’s family and eternal kingdom (1 Peter 2:9–10).\n\nWritten by Alex Florez",

    "devo_title": "Stephen",
    "devo_summary": "A fundamental part of being human is our creation and understanding of coherent life stories. The circumstances that bring great joy to us or cause the deepest sense of shame can be found in our perception of what constitutes the good life, and how our own life story is aligning with that perception. The central emotional core of a person or even a group can be discovered in the stories they find themselves in and how they interpret those stories. Sometimes, a challenge to the guiding story of a culture can result in the deepest intolerance, primal anger, and even murder.\n\nMeet Stephen, a leader of the church in Jerusalem, one chosen by the apostles to serve. Stephen is culturally Greek and a Jewish convert to Jesus Christ. In his outreach effort to other Greek-speaking Jews of Jerusalem, as well as before the religious ruling council, he implores them to remember the story of their people—and also includes a firm rebuke.\n\nStephen’s attempt to defend and persuade reaches back more than two thousand years and recounts the great redemptive story, which of course, includes those to whom he is speaking. He starts with Abraham and ends with the religious leaders’ rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. However, it is Stephen’s critique of the historic pattern of idolatry, their failure to truly follow the law of Moses, the rejection and murder of God’s prophets and now Jesus, that enrages them.\n\nIt’s Stephen’s interpretation of the story of God’s plan that brings about their rage. His faithfulness to stand firm and share the true gospel and point to the real Savior places him in extreme danger, and abruptly leads to his death by stoning. Was his life a waste and his death in vain? Absolutely not. Stephen’s martyrdom acted as the catalyst to push the early Christians out of Jerusalem and into the world. In his moment of greatest suffering, he was given a vision of Jesus Christ, prompting him to say: “‘Look, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!’” (Acts 7:55–56). And as he dies, he prays for those who are killing him:\n\n“Lord, do not hold this sin against them!” (Acts 7:60).\n\nHis words are similar to the words Jesus said while He was suffering on the cross (Luke 23:34); Stephen dies a martyr’s death that continues the work of God. Despite this violent murder scene initiated through false accusation in the most amazing and paradoxical way, Stephen’s prayer, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them”—an echo of Jesus’s own prayer—continues to be answered, as the enemies of God are lovingly and radically reconciled to Him (Romans 5:10).\n\nWritten by Robert Wheeler",

    "devo_title": "Thomas",
    "devo_summary": "It is easy to look at the disciples and wonder how they could’ve been so slow to understand who Jesus was. How could they have doubted Him? He was right in front of them. But we have the advantage of being on this side of the resurrection, so we can see the whole story arc of Scripture. And some of us still have the propensity to doubt! Had we been with the disciples, we likely would’ve been just like them.\n\nWhile Peter was the most bold and outspoken of the disciples, Thomas was the most consistent in his struggles to believe. In John 14, in the middle of the upper room discourse, Jesus is assuring His disciples that He will come again, and gives His final encouragement and charge to them just before being arrested. Immediately after Jesus says definitively, “If I go away and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to myself, so that where I am you may be also,” Thomas pipes up with a doubter’s question, asking how they could know where Jesus was going or how to get there (John 14:3–5). Jesus’s response leaves little room for doubt:\n\n“I am the way, the truth, and the life. \n\nNo one comes to the Father except through me. \n\nIf you know me, you will also know my Father. \n\nFrom now on you do know him and have seen him” (vv.6–7).\n\nTwice in four verses Jesus makes declarations of His lordship and of the way of salvation. Yet Thomas still hesitated to believe. Scripture defines faith as “the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen” (Hebrews 11:1). This is what Thomas was missing, the thing he lacked: what he could not see, he could not believe. He was a disciple, one of Jesus’s closest friends for three years. He was with Jesus at His arrest and with the rest of His followers after His death. He was a true follower of Christ, but he struggled to believe.\n\nAfter Jesus rose from the dead, He appeared to the rest of the disciples, but Thomas was absent. When the other disciples told him about their encounter with the risen Lord, Thomas said, “If I don’t see the mark of the nails in his hands, put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe” (John 20:25). Maybe he said this with arrogant defiance, but it seems more likely that he yearned to believe and simply could not. He had followed Jesus to the very end, but he did not know how to follow Him further.\n\nSo Jesus did what He does with seeking doubters: He gave Thomas reason to believe. He appeared again and showed Thomas His wounds, but He did not stop there. He wouldn’t let Thomas stagnate as a doubter. With the same clarity as He spoke in the upper room, Jesus declared:\n\n“Because you have seen me, you have believed. \n\nBlessed are those who have not seen and yet believe” (John 20:29).\n\nHe was summoning Thomas, and everyone who reads these words, to faith, for His “righteous one shall live by faith,” which is how He calls us to live (Hebrews 10:38).\n\nWe have the whole of Scripture, yet we still doubt. Like Thomas, we struggle to follow Jesus, who we forget is always with us (Hebrews 13:5; Psalm 46:1). And so Jesus’s words are for us too. He is preparing a place for us to be with Him (John 14:3). He is the way, the truth, and the life (v.6). And we are blessed if we believe without seeing, by faith.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper",

    "devo_title": "Barabbas",
    "devo_summary": "On the day Jesus was condemned to die, another man, Barabbas, was released from custody for the crimes he had actually committed. What little we know of Barabbas from the four Gospels is not flattering. In the book of Matthew, he’s a notorious criminal (Matthew 27:16); Mark and Luke call him a “murderer” who participated in a rebellion (Mark 15:7; Luke 23:19); and John’s account equates him with a robber or a bandit (John 18:40).\n\nKnowing little else about Barabbas, I’m left to fill in the gaps with my imagination. I picture him in chains, hearing the crowds chant his name just as the guards approach him, grunting out, “Pilate wants to see you.” Maybe he assumes that this is the end of the road: a swift and guilty verdict, followed by execution. He squints as he steps into the sunlight, noticing another prisoner standing before the crowd. Perhaps later he’ll reflect on this moment, but for now, all that registers is the cacophonous crowd and the pit in his stomach at the sight of the governor, the man whose judgment can end his life with a single word.\n\nI wonder what he thought about in his presumed final moments? With the hand of justice tightening around his throat, does he regret his actions or simply that he was caught? Is he ready to fight his sentence or submit to it?\n\nBut then, in a surreal moment that Barabbas himself might never come to understand, the crowd erupts into a frenzied cheer as Pilate raises a hand in his direction; instead of leading him to his execution, the guards release him to the mob whose thirst for blood has shifted to another man: “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS” (John 19:19). The rest of Barabbas’s life remains lost to history.\n\nBarabbas walked away a free man that day, making it easy to judge him as a hopeless criminal who literally got away with murder. But if I’m honest, I see that I have something significant in common with Barabbas: a lifetime’s worth of thoughts, words, and deeds that fall infinitely short of God’s glory and should condemn me to exist apart from His presence forever (Romans 3:23). But instead, Jesus died in my place—He died instead of me. It was His blood that pardoned me and set me free. And so these words from the apostle Peter feel as if they’re directed just to me:\n\n“You denied the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer released to you. \n\nYou killed the source of life, whom God raised from the dead; \n\nwe are witnesses of this” (Acts 3:14–15).\n\nJesus took my place on the cross that day, and so, in a very real way, it was I who killed Him. But if He died at my hands, He was raised to life by God’s, and I recognize that I share in that part of the story too. Like Barabbas, my guilt has been stricken from the record, the bloodstains on my hands washed clean away. I don’t know what Barabbas did with his freedom, but with mine, I cling to the hope of glory offered by the one who set me free.\n\nWritten by Alex Florez",

    "devo_summary": "The Church has faced many foes over the centuries. Some of them came in the form of government leaders who sought to persecute and destroy the Church, while others came from those who appeared to be friendly, but who instead brought in destructive doctrines that harmed the Church from within. Throughout history, the Church has faced down depressions, wars, famine, and disease, yet she always continues to grow and march forward.\n\nThis year has brought with it words like “COVID-19” and “quarantine,” things we never could have imagined becoming a regular part of our vocabulary. I work as both a teacher and a pastor, and this season has forced me to learn how to do both in completely new ways. This past spring, I had to figure out how to teach, disciple, and minister to a flock comprised of many who do not have Internet or social media access, and many whose homes I should not enter because they are more susceptible to the disease. Churches and pastors are concerned about how this will affect their church’s ability to minister and survive. Families are hurting. People are in great need, and we don’t know what even the next few months may hold.\n\nIn the midst of this uncertainty, I drew immense encouragement from today’s readings. Pilate thought that he stood before Jesus as one who had the authority to let Him live or die. What he did not know was that the Creator of life and the One who was about to defeat death was standing there before him. Pilate clearly wanted no part of the sham trial in which he had been forced to participate. He faced intense pressure from the Pharisees and chief priests to put Jesus to death, and while he could find no fault in Him, he was ultimately afraid of the people’s word against him before the Roman government. And so he handed over the Son of God to be crucified in order to pacify a blood-thirsty crowd.\n\nPsalm 2 provides us with a glimpse into how heaven views these foolish attempts to usurp the power of God and His Son. Human rulers have no power at all before God. When Pilate asked the people if he should crucify their King, he asked more than he ever could have imagined. Rather than putting another pretender to the throne to death, Pilate had sentenced God’s anointed King—the Son who would receive the nations as His inheritance—to die like a common thief.\n\nIn sending Jesus to His death, Pilate did not know that he and every human ruler were about to be exposed as the powerless, dependent creatures they really are. Pilate did not have power over life and death, but Jesus did, defeating death when He was raised from the dead.\n\nOnly God knows what trial each of us will be facing as we read this. Whatever it may be, let me assure you of this: the real King is on His throne. Whatever circumstances we may be facing, whoever may be lined up against us, whatever pain life may throw our way, none of it catches our Father off guard, and He is working it all together for the good of those who love Him (Romans 8:28). The King is strong and the King is good, and you can trust Him today.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton",

    "devo_summary": "While writing her play about Jesus, The Man Born to Be King, Dorothy Sayers struggled to understand what drove Judas. She asked, “What did the man imagine he was doing? He is an absolute riddle. He can’t have been awful from the start, or Christ never would have called him.”\n\nHe was a riddle. We know Judas was greedy and that he skimmed off the top (John 12:6). But the money the chief priests offered in exchange for Jesus, thirty pieces of silver, hardly compensated for the three years he spent following Jesus. Though no one can really say conclusively all that drove Judas, there are some things we do know. First, we know the man he seemed to be. He seemed to be a devoted disciple who did the same things as the others. He had concealed his duplicity so well that when Jesus declared one of the disciples would betray Him, no one immediately pointed in Judas’s direction.\n\nSecond, we know he acted under the influence of Satan. John tells us it wasn’t just that Judas was indifferent to Jesus. He was acting in collusion with the devil (John 6:70; 13:2, 27). Think of all he saw and heard: every miracle, parable, and act of mercy. Neither Jesus’s words nor His actions penetrated Judas’s heart. He was a riddle, to be sure, part pragmatist, part pretender, part conspirator. Maybe even he couldn’t even explain his own reasons.\n\nDuring the last supper, when Jesus offered Judas bread, it was a gesture of love, an opportunity to consider their history together. But Judas’s mind was already made up. He took the bread from Jesus’s hand and then he left. Everyone likely figured since he kept the money, he was off to settle a tab or give the customary Passover alms to the poor on their behalf. They were wrong.\n\nAs one who saw this moment unfold, John tells us what was really going on as Judas disappeared: “After receiving the piece of bread, he immediately left. And it was night” (John 13:30). Light and darkness are prevalent symbols throughout John’s Gospel. He often spoke of Jesus as the Light of the World (John 1:9; 3:19; 8:12; 9:5; 11:9; 12:46). John described Judas as a man abandoning the Light of the World to step into the darkness. The next time the two would meet would be later that night when Judas arrived at Gethsemane with a band of soldiers.\n\n“Friend,” Jesus asked him, “why have you come?” \n\nThen they came up, took hold of Jesus, and arrested him (Matthew 26:50).\n\nJesus knew full well why Judas had come, yet He kept the door open for reconciliation until the end. But Judas wouldn’t have it.\n\nIs Christ offering you reconciliation today? If you are a pretender, it’s possible the only ones who know it are you and Jesus. There is grace and joy to be found in Him, but this isn’t a game. Judas reminds us that we can sit under solid teaching, spend time with believers, even participate in ministry, and still be a fraud. Being known as a Christian and loving Jesus can be two entirely different things.\n\nAs you see Judas go out into the darkness, may you also see Jesus, the Light of the World, remain unshakably dedicated to His mission to die in your place. He loves you. Do you love Him?\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

    "devo_summary": "It’s amazing to me how different the personalities of siblings can be. My brother and I have the same genetic makeup from our parents, the same receding hairlines, and the same eyesight in need of significant correction—yet our personalities are very different.\n\nBrian is the smart and adventurous type—a hands-on, mechanical guy. When we were kids, he was less inclined to participate in the “normal” team sports like football and basketball, preferring the outdoor adventures of mountain biking and summiting 20,000-foot mountains, or taking stuff apart just so he could put it back together again. I, on the other hand, enjoy picking apart an argument in a book. I’m the guy who follows team sports, and while I have climbed to 15,000 feet, I’m more apt to studying the subjects of the humanities: history and theology, and an occasional philosopher or two. My brother and I are a lot alike, but we’re also very different individuals.\n\nMary and Martha present the same sort of contrast, especially in their spirituality. Luke describes the time Martha and Mary were hosting Jesus at their home. Certainly, they were close friends, and having Jesus over didn’t seem unusual. But on this particular occasion, one sister, Martha, was busy preparing the meal and getting things ready. Mary, on the other hand, was sitting and listening to Jesus teach, in the place of a disciple. Instead of doing the work expected of the women in preparation of the meal, she was at the feet of Jesus, listening, learning, and receiving. Instead of trying to feed Jesus, she was being fed by Him. However, her sister, Martha, “was distracted by her many tasks,” her frustration obvious as she asked:\n\n“Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to serve alone? \n\nSo tell her to give me a hand” (Luke 10:40).\n\nWhile the differences between these two women stand out, their faith in Christ as the “resurrection and the life” (John 11:25), and their devotion and expressions of love to Him demonstrate that they were committed to the same pursuit: honoring and loving Jesus with all they had. Could that be the lesson for us? Could we be as bold in our devotion, service, humble learning, and trust of Jesus as these women were?\n\nBoth women cried out to Jesus, mourning the death of Lazarus: “Lord, If you had been here my brother would not have died” (John 11:21, 32). Their grief showed itself in their shared family traits: a bold, responsive, trusting faith in Jesus. And Jesus met them in their sorrow.\n\nThat faith built upon itself as Mary displayed her understanding of the work of Jesus, anointing His feet with luxurious, expensive oil, as if to prepare Him for His burial—this, too, was an act of worship and devotion (John 12:1–8). Mary understood that “one thing is necessary”—Jesus—and she chose Him above all else (Luke 10:42).\n\nThough the faith of these women is shown in different ways, it is strong all the same. They held back nothing to follow Him and love Him. Could we be more like them in our own pursuits of Christ?\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol",

    "devo_summary": "It was a huge surprise when I heard that a dear friend and his wife had contracted COVID-19. A disease that had previously involved masses of unnamed people around the globe immediately struck close to home. They are just a short drive from us, and before the quarantine, it was common for us to meet up for lunch or coffee together. Instantly, this is no longer a faceless disease affecting thousands around the world—now, it has affected my close friends! My experience with this illness is no longer something I can hold at arm’s length.\n\nIt seems there is a moment in each human life when the myth of our own invulnerability comes to an end. We become keenly aware of our own fragility and mortality. Nothing threatens our perceived sense of control quite like a severe illness and the possibility of death. Sickness and death have been part of every human’s existence from the beginning of life, and yet these inevitabilities still take us by surprise. Every sickness strikes at an inopportune time, and the loss of a friend is always premature. We are to do battle with these foes, and yet we know that every single one of us will succumb at some point—our lives will end. It is often during these seasons of illness and loss that we are most aware of Jesus’s care.\n\nHis experience with sickness and death is not removed from the same sort of emotional pain and loss that we feel. It can be tempting to imagine Jesus going about His life without the same sort of pains that we experience. His relationship with two sisters and their brother shows us the extreme care and sensitivity He has toward His friend’s suffering, sickness, and death.\n\nMeet Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, three siblings who had a unique and special friendship with Jesus. Theirs was a noteworthy connection, and their home and hospitality played an important role in His life. When Jesus hears about the serious illness of His dear friend, Lazarus, He prepares for the four-day journey that will take Him from relative safety into much more danger, saying:\n\n“Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I’m on my way to wake him up” (John 11:11).\n\nHis disciples warn Him of the imminent danger. They know that journeying to this region will likely result in His death and perhaps even their own. And they are correct; in the most practical way, Jesus lives out His own teaching, eventually laying down His life for His friends, for us—”no one has greater love than this” (John 15:13).\n\nWe know what happened to Lazarus. It is thrilling and shocking, and it reveals so much about the unique authority Jesus Christ has over death. On a closer look, there is also something particularly compelling and beautiful about the quality of the self-giving friendship between Jesus and these three siblings. The sisters ask their good friend to take the four-day journey back to help the one He loved. And Jesus answers in the affirmative, ready to take on the days of travel toward His own danger, rejection, suffering, and death. Jesus loves His friends. He goes to them and is deeply moved by them. He suffers with them and will suffer for them—and they weep together.\n\nWritten by Robert Wheeler",

We might have missed the point that Zacchaeus’s story is much more significant than simply a tale of a tiny guy climbing a tree and meeting Jesus.\n\nZacchaeus was a tax collector, meaning he was in league with the hated Roman Empire, and a thief who overcharged his fellow Jews, skimming the profits for his own benefit. Throughout the Gospels we read of “tax collectors and sinners” as a group of despised, loathsome people hated by God-fearing Jews for their immorality. Zacchaeus was chief among them. So when Zacchaeus made the decision to climb a sycamore tree to see Jesus, he was discarding what little dignity he had left.\n\nBut that is not the truly surprising part of the story. When Jesus saw him, He called Zacchaeus by name, as one who knew him, and said, “Hurry and come down because today it is necessary for me to stay at your house” (Luke 19:5). After all, He did not come to call the righteous, but to call sinners to repentance (Luke 5:32).\n\nIn the face of judgment and complaint, Jesus went to Zacchaeus’s home. The text has little to say about their conversation; it simply records the transformation that took place. Zacchaeus willingly offered up half of his wealth for the poor and promised to repay everyone he had extorted four times what he had initially taken (Luke 19:8). By Jewish law, a just repayment would have been full repayment with a twenty percent penalty (Leviticus 6:5). But Zaccheus offered a four hundred percent repayment, because true repentance is not just ceasing to sin, but turning away from it altogether and hating it. When Jesus heard this from Zacchaeus He simply said:\n\n“Today salvation has come to this house… \n\nbecause he too is a son of Abraham. \n\nFor the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost” (Luke 19:9–10).\n\nBy declaring this, Jesus was calling Zacchaeus a true child of God, a person of true faith (Galatians 3:12). This was a man turning from the idol of money to follow Jesus no matter the cost. He was no longer putting his faith in wealth but trusting that God would never leave him or abandon him (Hebrews 13:5). Rather than hoarding wealth that would rot away, Zaccheus began storing up treasures in heaven (Matthew 6:19).\n\nIn truth, Zacchaeus’s small stature matters little in his story. Only his change of heart matters. His change of Lord matters—from that of money to Jesus (Matthew 6:24). He is a picture of true and deep repentance and the lasting transformation it brings.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper",

    "devo_summary": "In 2009, I was a senior in high school, and I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to study computer science at an elite institution and go work for Google or one of the other Silicon Valley behemoths. I wanted to change the world, sure, but I also wanted to make truckloads of money. I wanted to be a Christian, too, but just as an added feature to my life, because more than anything, I wanted to make lots of money—with a side of maybe changing the world along the way. I was aspirationally rich, so to speak, but not unlike the young man we read about in today’s passage.\n\nIn Mark 10, we meet “the rich young ruler,” who approaches Jesus about what it takes to inherit eternal life (vv.17–22). This wealthy young man runs up to Jesus and asks, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” (Mark 10:17). Jesus responds by listing some of the laws required for following the Lord, and the rich young ruler testifies that he does not break these laws, that he has “kept all these from [his] youth” (v.20). What follows is a tremendous scene of Jesus’s love and the young man’s disappointment.\n\n“Looking at him, Jesus loved him and said to him, \n\n‘You lack one thing: Go, sell all you have and give to the poor, \n\nand you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.’ \n\nBut he was dismayed by this demand, and he went away grieving, \n\nbecause he had many possessions” (Mark 10:21–22).\n\nJesus loved this young man enough to tell him the truth—that not even keeping all of the commandments is not enough to be saved—news that would’ve been difficult for him to hear and receive in that moment. In order for the man to inherit eternal life, he must be willing to give up what he values most in his present, earthly life: his riches.\n\nSo much can be gleaned from Jesus’s interaction with the rich young ruler, first and foremost being that it is difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of God (Mark 10:23–31). Not because it’s a sin to be rich, but because wealth often comes with a love of money and sense of independence that can become greater than a love for God (Matthew 6:24).\n\nMore broadly speaking, when we read this man’s story, we ought to ask ourselves: What part of my life am I unwilling to give up in order to follow Jesus? What do I love more than I love Him? Following Jesus costs us everything. Even good things we love. The entirety of our lives must be submitted to His lordship. Don’t turn away sad like the rich young ruler. Joyfully lay down your worldly possessions for a life of following Him.\n\nWritten by Chris Martin",

    "devo_summary": "To follow Jesus is to leave another world and way behind.\n\nWith the Passover drawing near, Jesus and His followers stopped in Jericho to gather supplies for the last eighteen miles of their pilgrimage into Jerusalem. As they left the city, a large crowd followed (Mark 10:46).\n\nA blind man named Bartimaeus sat outside the city gate begging (Luke 18:35). In that day and age, his condition doomed him to a life of poverty and darkness. This was the nature of the world he inhabited. Blindness dictated that he’d be a beggar for life, helpless at the gates, living off the charity of other men and women.\n\nBartimaeus, who experienced the world through the sounds and the silences of the people around him, sat up when he heard the large, enthusiastic crowd flood the street by which he sat. He called for someone to tell him what was happening. “Jesus of Nazareth is coming,” someone said. Sitting up in excitement, Bartimaeus cried out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me” (Mark 10:47).\n\nAs he cried out for Jesus’s mercy, the crowds told him to be quiet (Luke 18:39). But Bartimaeus believed the prophets who said that “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Joel 2:32), so he dug down deep and cried out even louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” Though they’d never met, Bartimaeus believed this serendipitous encounter on the road outside of Jericho could very likely be the moment where God would exchange the ashes of his life for beauty, and he did not want to let this hour of the Lord’s favor pass him by (Isaiah 61:2–3).\n\nJesus called for him, and springing to his feet, Bartimaeus threw down his cloak that held the proceeds of that day’s begging and took the hand of a man who led him to Jesus (Mark 10:50).\n\n“What do you want me to do for you?” Jesus asked him.\n\nBartimaeus did not hesitate: “I want to see” (Mark 10:51).\n\nHe didn’t want money. He didn’t want honor. He wanted his eyes opened. Bartimaeus saw Jesus as the one man who could do for him something no one else could. He knew he was asking for more than the gift of sight. If Jesus were to heal Bartimaeus, He would strip away the man’s means of income, his place in the community, his daily routine, his identity. Bartimaeus understood this, but who else could deliver him? (Romans 7:24). And when Jesus did heal him, He said, “Receive your sight… Your faith has saved you” (Luke 18:42–43; Mark 10:52).\n\nTo Bartimaeus, his way was now wherever Jesus was, and so he began to follow Him, glorifying God (Luke 18:43). This moment was so much more than a miracle for Bartimaeus. It was a conversion. He didn’t just put his faith in Jesus; he put his life in Jesus’s hands, leaving everything behind to follow Him.\n\nMany come to Jesus thinking He can do wonderful things for them, but when people come asking for a new life few realize this means they must leave their old one behind. And yet, no matter what is left behind, what is given in exchange is infinitely greater.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

    "devo_title": "John",
    "devo_summary": "There are many incredible stories of personal transformation in the Bible, but perhaps one of the most overlooked is that of the apostle John. Along with his brother James, John was one of the most boisterous and strong-headed disciples. It’s likely that’s the reason Jesus called these two sons of Zebedee “the Sons of Thunder” (Mark 3:17)—which has got to be one of the best nicknames in the entire Bible.\n\nThese two brothers caused quite a stir among the other disciples when they asked to be seated at the right and left sides of Jesus upon entering heaven (Mark 10:35–45). Maybe it was misguided passion that caused the brothers to ask for this honor, but it came across as youthful arrogance. Their boneheaded request stirred up indignation from the rest of the Twelve. It also earned them a strong rebuke from Jesus in the form of a sermon about humility, explaining that “even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many” (v.45).\n\nJohn witnessed the major miracle moment of Jesus’s transfiguration (Mark 9:2–8), one that helped equate Him with His Father in heaven, and during His crucifixion, Jesus personally instructed John to watch over His mother Mary once He was gone (John 19:16–27).\n\nIn his older years, John likely had plenty of time to mull over all of these experiences and life lessons. Out of the Twelve, only John would live to old age. Tradition holds that each of the other apostles were martyred because of their faith.\n\nI imagine John played these significant memories in his mind over and over again as he wrote the Gospel and epistles that bear his name. These are the events that shaped not only his life but also the early Church. I wonder if, in his final days, John pondered why he, among all the disciples, was not sentenced to death as a martyr. Surely he missed his friends, his brother, and his Savior. Toward the end of his life, John was exiled to the Greek island of Patmos for preaching the gospel. This is where he would write the book of Revelation. The words and revelation given to John after his extensive life experience are also a gift to us, thousands of years later.\n\nJohn is an example of what it’s like to be radically transformed by God’s love, regardless of occupation or station in life; God uses us all to build and grow His Church. John was transformed from a headstrong, perhaps self-serving, young disciple into a faith-filled and faithful old man with the gift of memories from Christ’s earthly days, of witnessing His Savior’s ministry firsthand. His story exemplifies the life-changing power of Christ’s love.\n\nWritten by Robert Carnes",

    "devo_title": "Mary Magdalene",
    "devo_summary": "Some of the most precious words in all of Scripture are “and such were some of you” (1Corinthians 6:11, ESV). After listing categories of people who would not inherit the kingdom of God, Paul reminded the Corinthians that they, too, once fit in these categories. “But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God” (v.11). The shame of their past lives had been redeemed and cleansed by the work of the Lord Jesus.\n\nI cannot help but think of these words from 1 Corinthians 6 when I read the narrative of Mary Magdalene’s interactions with Jesus. When we meet Mary in Luke’s Gospel, she is with Jesus and the Twelve as He is “telling the good news of the kingdom of God” (Luke 8:1–2). From this passage, we’re told she was a woman from whom seven demons had gone out (v.2), which means that when she first encountered Jesus, she was demon-possessed. But now here she is, standing alongside Him as He preaches the good news.\n\nMary demonstrated the new life she had found in Jesus by her faithful service to Him. Mark reports that she was one of the women who “followed him and took care of him” (Mark 15:41). When Jesus hung on the tree, she did not abandon Him, but instead stood there watching with other women as her Lord gave His life (John 19:25). And before daybreak on the morning of the resurrection, she discovered that the stone sealing His tomb had been rolled away and ran to share the news with the disciples (John 20:1–2). After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to her and entrusted her with the task of telling the disciples about His impending ascension to the Father. She announced to them, “‘I have seen the Lord!’ And she told them what he had said to her” (vv.11–16,18).\n\nMary Magdalene’s sin and shame, whatever they may be, did not have the final word—God’s grace did. Mary met Jesus and He changed the trajectory of her life forever. He does the same for us. Have you been worried that God might not use you because of sin in your past? Are you afraid that people will hear you talk about Jesus and assume you are a hypocrite because of the things you did before you were a Christian? Look at Mary. Luke’s first words about her tell us what she once was, but look at what she became because of her Savior!\n\nMary met Jesus when she was demon-possessed, and after she was delivered of them, she followed Him faithfully. And when each of us first met Jesus, there was nothing particularly impressive about us; like everyone else, we were mired in sin and foolishness. What did He do? He washed us, saved us, justified us, and cleansed us. Now, as men who have been made new, we faithfully follow Him. We love Him, we serve Him, and we bear witness to His saving grace.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton",

    "devo_summary": "If you were to ask me the names of the Christians who’ve had the greatest influence on me, I wouldn’t list well-known pastors, leaders, or authors, though many have helped shape my thinking on important subjects. No, you wouldn’t recognize the names of those who’ve had the deepest impact on my life. Some are pastors, though most weren’t when I met them. Some are teachers, some homemakers, and others are businessmen. Simply put, the Christians who have influenced me the most are normal, ordinary followers of Jesus who God has used in extraordinary ways.\n\nIn today’s reading, we have a beautiful example of how Jesus used an ordinary person and everyday objects to reveal more of Himself. After Jesus healed a man who had been lame for almost forty years, He crossed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. By this time in His ministry, many had been astounded by Jesus’s works and miracles, and crowds of people had begun to follow Him.\n\nThe time of Passover was near and crowds were growing and continuing to follow Him. And so He turned to Philip and asked where they could find bread to feed such a crowd. Philip’s answer? Not even two hundred denarii worth of bread (roughly seven months’ wages) would “be enough for each of them to have a little” (John 6:7).\n\nBut then another disciple, Andrew, said, “There’s a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish—but what are they for so many?” (vv.8–9). And he was right; how could so little feed so many? But for Jesus, it was enough. The boy came and gave all he had, what must’ve seemed like a small offering to some, and Jesus multiplied it to feed the massive crowd. John emphasized the completeness of the miracle when he explained that everyone had eaten their fill, and yet there was enough left over to fill up twelve baskets (vv.10–13). Jesus took this boy’s small meal and used it to fill the bellies of a crowd of thousands—plus leftovers.\n\nJesus’s miracle spoke volumes about who He is, revealing that He is more than enough to satisfy the crowd’s deepest needs. They knew the story of the manna that God had rained down from heaven to feed the Israelites during their flight from Egypt (Exodus 16; John 6:31). Jesus reminded them that the Father gives true bread, and in answer to their desire to receive “this bread always” (v.34), Jesus told them:\n\n“I am the bread of life… \n\nNo one who comes to me will ever be hungry, \n\nand no one who believes in me will ever be thirsty again” (v.35).\n\nJesus’s words were loaded and the people knew it. He had invoked the divine name, “I AM,” which God used to reveal Himself to Moses (Exodus 3:14). He was making the connection for them: the manna in the wilderness was ultimately pointing to Him all along. The people simply wanted full bellies, but Jesus was showing them that He alone could feed their souls.\n\nOne of the astonishing features of this narrative is the small sacrifice that led to Jesus’s amazing demonstration of power and the stunning proclamation of His deity. Every Christian who has ever wondered what role they can play in the kingdom of God should be encouraged by this boy’s example. We don’t know his name, but Jesus used this boy’s offering to proclaim His saving power and might to the multitude.\n\nHe does the same with us. We bring Jesus our time, talents, and treasures—as small and insignificant as they appear to be—and He multiplies them, impacting and changing the lives of many.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton",

    "devo_summary": "God loves to use the unexpected: unlikely kings, unlikely prophets, unlikely disciples, and unlikely mothers. The Samaritan woman in John 4 is an unlikely convert and evangelist. She had everything working against her. She was a woman in a patriarchal society, where even speaking publicly with a man was taboo. She was a Samaritan talking with a Jew, though their cultures despised one another. She had a checkered relational and sexual past, pushing her to the fringes of society. Yet Jesus still sought her.\n\nTheir conversation at Jacob’s well is an odd one. It bounces from topic to topic so as to leave the reader quite confused—living water and multiple husbands and places of worship and so forth. But if we read carefully, we see Jesus masterfully, gently, and pointedly guiding her to an understanding of saving truth.\n\nHe asks for a drink of water to open the door to conversation then quickly offers her living water. She doesn’t understand and is understandably taken aback, but Jesus presses even harder with a direct offer of salvation: “Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty again” (John 4:14). Again, she fails to understand.\n\nJesus pivots again, this time in a seemingly bizarre manner, asking about her husband. Why? What is He getting at? It is not random at all. Jesus is showing her who He is, the Lord who searches hearts and gives to each according to their deeds (Jeremiah 17:10). He is declaring His power and kingship and showing that His offer of living water is infinitely more than she could imagine. By offering living water, Jesus is declaring Himself the Alpha and Omega and offering her access to the river of life that flows from the throne of God (Revelation 21:6). He is offering her healing and wholeness in the presence of God (Revelation 22:1–5).\n\nShe tries to deflect by changing the subject and throwing out a red-herring argument for debate about where the proper place to worship is for Jews and Samaritans. Jesus turns that around, too, ending with a declaration of Himself as the Messiah. Finally she is left with no argument and no response but to tell her fellow townspeople, “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?” (John 4:29). And many did believe because of her testimony and because of Jesus’s words.\n\nJesus preached one of His most powerful sermons, made some of His clearest claims as Savior and Messiah, and promised eternal life to a promiscuous Samaritan woman, perhaps the least likely of recipients. He did so with kindness and gentleness, but He would not let her deflect or ignore or misunderstand. He wanted her to believe, and she did. And her response was to spread the good news, telling others to come, to meet Jesus. The water of life is for all who believe, no matter how unlikely, and it is to be shared by all who believe and trust in Jesus.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper",

    "devo_title": "Jairus & His Daughter",
    "devo_summary": "Faith is such a hard concept to teach. It seems so abstract, so contradictory in its definition of the assured reality of what we cannot see. “Seeing is believing”—that’s the phrase so many areas of our lives push us to affirm, as if seeing something is what makes it real. That’s what makes the biblical concept of faith so contradictory: “Now faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen” (Hebrews 11:1).\n\nFaith is the “proof of what is not seen” in a world where seeing is the most widely-accepted kind of proof. So the Christian faith is truly otherworldly. It feels foreign to the human understanding of truth and how we measure reality. The faith we are called to have as Christians is powerful because our faith is in the finished work of our God, not the future work of our own hands. It is this faith that pushes back the gnawing ache of fear, even amidst the darkest darkness of life.\n\nIn Mark chapter 5, we are introduced to Jairus and his daughter. A leader of the synagogue, Jairus comes to beg Jesus to save his daughter as she is dying. He believes Jesus has the ability to save his daughter, and Jesus begins following him to his home.\n\nWe don’t know much about Jairus or his daughter, but we do know he was a religious leader in the local synagogue. He likely had more money than the average person living at that time. Even the fact that he was a man, rather than a woman, gave him authority in his day. All of these things combined would have made him one of the most powerful people around—a stark contrast to the bleeding woman who grabs Jesus’s clothes as He is on His way to heal Jairus’s daughter.\n\nWhen Jesus finally arrives at the synagogue leader’s house, people are clamoring, talking about how the daughter has died. Sensing fear in Jairus, He tells him, “Don’t be afraid. Only believe” (Mark 5:36). Jesus proceeds to tell the crowd in the house that the girl is asleep, not dead, which draws mockery and laughter from those in attendance. Jesus then goes to the girl, takes her hand, and says, “Little girl, I say to you, get up” (vv.41–42).\n\nWhat is it that we are desperate for the Lord to fix in our own lives? Do we think it is impossible for the Lord to intervene and answer prayers we pray in the midst of mockery and doubt? Faith is the antidote to fear. When we fear evil and its effects on our lives, we lack faith in God to overcome the world, but He already has (John 16:33). The Lord has not forgotten us, and so whatever it is we fear, we must take heart: He is already near and He loves us.\n\nWritten by Chris Martin",

    "devo_summary": "Reading about the life of Peter—his triumphs, his blunders, and his heart—it’s not hard to see why Jesus chose the gruff fisherman to be one of His closest friends during His earthly life. If I were to describe Peter in a hashtagable phrase, it would be all in.\n\nWhen we first meet Peter in Luke’s Gospel, he’s just come in from a long night of fishing. On the crowded shore of the Sea of Galilee, his world collides with Jesus. From the start, Peter is all in. He gives Jesus his boat to use as a pulpit, so the crowds can hear Him (Luke 5:3). He obeys Jesus against all earthly common sense to go out for another round of fishing—with nets that he’d just cleaned after being out all night (vv.4–7). And then he leaves everything behind to follow Jesus (v.11).\n\nBut that’s just the beginning. Peter’s the only disciple to get out of the boat to walk on the water with Jesus (Matthew 14:28–29). He’s the first disciple to confess Jesus is “the Messiah, the Son of the living God” (Matthew 16:16). And even if the attempt was misguided, he’s the one who pulls out a sword to defend Jesus from arrest (John 18:10). Peter is all in for Jesus. It’s no wonder Jesus likes to have Peter by His side.\n\nBut Peter is also all in when it comes to his fear. When the pressure is on, Peter denies Jesus three times to save his own skin (Luke 22:54–62). Along with the other disciples, Peter runs and hides while Jesus is being beaten and crucified for our sins (Matthew 26:31).\n\nWhen I read about this side of Peter’s story, I can’t help but see myself. How many times have I done the safe thing rather than the right thing? How many times have I thought about my own well-being rather than the sacrifice Jesus made on my behalf? As much as I want to be the Peter who steps out onto the Sea of Galilee and walks on the waves, I’m more often the Peter who sinks with his doubts.\n\nThankfully, Peter’s story is ultimately not dependent on his own faithfulness, because Jesus is all in for Peter. Whether the fisherman is getting things right or wrong, Jesus is pulling for His friend. Even before Peter’s cowardly betrayal, Jesus prays for his future ministry (Luke 22:31–32). And when He is resurrected from the dead, Jesus makes a point of commissioning Peter three times to feed His sheep—a threefold restoration for a threefold betrayal (John 21:15–17). This is good news for all of us who resemble Peter in this way. Let’s be all in for Jesus; He’s all in for us. He proved it on the cross.\n\nWritten by John Greco",

    "devo_summary": "It’s been just about fifteen years since I met Jesus. I can still remember what it was like to be brand new to the faith—and also what it was like to be completely hostile toward the gospel, when what seemed so obvious to those who believed was anything but to the uninitiated like me.\n\nThe Bible is full of the stories of people who were trying to make sense of Jesus. People like Nicodemus. He was one of the religious elite, one of the people you would expect to know everything about what it meant to worship God (John 3:1). But when he heard about Jesus’s teaching, he was curious. When he heard about the signs He performed, Nicodemus knew he had to speak to Him.\n\nBut when he actually talked to Jesus, he was confused. Jesus said strange things that seemed to make no sense, things that were surely impossible, like: “Unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” (John 3:3). I have to wonder, in that moment when Jesus was explaining this, did Nicodemus get it? Did he understand what Jesus was talking about? Maybe. But probably not.\n\nIn fact, I’m willing to bet that Nicodemus didn’t get it that night. Because there was a time when I didn’t either (and ditto for you, too). And that’s okay. But here’s what I love: the interaction between Nicodemus and Jesus isn’t the end of Nicodemus’s story. Nicodemus keeps showing up all throughout John’s Gospel. He’s on this journey trying to figure things out. He left Jesus in the night and didn’t understand, but He kept wrestling with what Jesus told him. When the other religious leaders were trying to decide what to do with Jesus, Nicodemus began to defend Him (John 7:45–52). He still didn’t seem to quite know what to make of Him, but He knew that Jesus wasn’t some charlatan. And then we see him again, after Jesus has been killed, as one of the people who prepared His body for burial (John 19:38–42).\n\nNicodemus was on this journey for years. He didn’t understand at first, but he didn’t stop trying to figure out who Jesus was. It wasn’t obvious to him, but eventually, it seems like he got it. Through three years of wrestling, he began to see what can only be seen by those who are born again.\n\nI still remember when I saw and understood the truth; when what wasn’t obvious to me, suddenly was. And that’s something I hope I don’t forget, especially when I think about people I know who still don’t understand the gospel. They don’t get it now, but that doesn’t mean they never will. It might be three years or thirty, but someday, it could happen. They, just like you and me, could be born again, and when they are, they will see the kingdom of God for themselves.\n\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong",

    "devo_summary": "It’s noteworthy that the one meant to pave the way for the Messiah didn’t create a new school of thought within the walls of the temple system. He wasn’t integrated into the political hierarchy of the day, artfully preparing for Jesus to emerge as a powerful leader. He was not a great warrior, destined to be captain of Jesus’s guard.\n\nHe was a desert prophet.\n\nThe cousin of our Lord lived an eccentric, ascetic, and intentional life. Wearing animal furs, eating wild honey and locusts, and proclaiming a message of change; John spent most of his adult days in the harsh landscape of the desert wilderness. His behaviors and appearance may strike us as odd, and they would’ve been outside of the norm for the typical working person in his day too. His austere appearance was mirrored by his stark message of repentance and preparation.\n\nAnd yet he amassed quite a following, and what he had to say struck a chord with the people. So much so that the authorities and the establishment were concerned about his popularity. His message was powerful, authentic, and rang true, and it confronted the establishment in some pretty intense ways.\n\nWe can learn a lot from John the Baptist when it comes to stewarding influence. His entire life can be characterized as a bold, unwavering arrow, pointing toward anyone who had eyes to see Jesus. From his miraculous birth, to his tragic death, John the Baptist lived one core message that could be summed up as this: Get real about yourself, get right with the Lord, get ready for the Messiah. He directed every follower he ever had straight to Jesus.\n\nWe live in the age of personal influence management. “You are your own brand”—that’s a mantra we hear a lot from leadership and business gurus. And, on a pragmatic marketplace level, they’re not wrong. More and more, we hear talks and read articles about “influence” as it relates not only to organizations but as it relates to individuals. In our day, the real question is not whether or not you have influence, but what are you doing with it? Whose banner are you raising? Whose name are you really hoping will be made great? How willing are you to hand it all over so that it points to Jesus?\n\nWe may not be called to be prophets, but we are called to use our gifts, our talents, our voices, and our influence to point to Jesus with everything we’ve got. Even when, from a temporal perspective, it doesn’t seem like a prudent investment or a wise bet. Whether a banker or a butcher, an entrepreneur or an engineer, we must be prepared to pour out every ounce of our energy and influence to point to Jesus, the one who makes all things new, right, and whole.\n\nWe have a bit of an advantage compared to John. He had to stake everything, every ounce of his reputation, on the one who was coming after him. Jesus hadn’t walked on water yet, nor had He healed blind Bartimaeus. Jesus hadn’t conquered the grave, yet John staked everything on what was to come.\n\nWe have the distinct historical advantage of already knowing the powerful outcome of Jesus’s earthly ministry. We can point to the one who was, and is, and is to come, declaring with confidence and everything we have that He is greater (Revelation 1:8; Matthew 3:11). Full stop.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard",

    "devo_summary": "I love to know things. All the things. It’s probably not healthy, but there you go. On the one hand, this desire to know everything has created in me a lifelong love of learning. On the other hand, it can make me pretty impatient when there’s something I don’t know and no one can help me find the answer.\n\nIn other words, I’m the opposite of people like Anna and Simeon. I love how understated their stories are here in Luke’s Gospel. They both longed for the redemption of Israel—for the promised Messiah to come, the one who would be called “Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace” (Isaiah 9:6).\n\nAnna served in the temple, praying and fasting day and night (Luke 2:36). Simeon was told by God that he would not die before he actually saw Him with his own eyes (v.26). How long had he waited, I wonder. Was he patient as he waited for God to do what He promised to do? Did he have moments of doubt and frustration? Whatever Simeon and Anna might have felt, there’s a powerful emotional pay-off when, on a certain day, a couple named Mary and Joseph brought a baby named Jesus into the temple to be dedicated—and all of a sudden the wait was over.\n\nThe Messiah had come, and Simeon didn’t just get to see Him with his own eyes—he got to hold Him in his arms! Is it any wonder that he prayed, “Now Master, you can dismiss your servant in peace, as you promised. For my eyes have seen your salvation” (Luke 2:29–30). In other words, That’s it! I’m good—I can die now because You kept Your promise, Lord! And when Anna saw Jesus, she did much the same, thanking God and telling everyone about the Messiah, sharing the good news with all those who were longing for redemption (v.38).\n\nThey got to see what we have not. They got to see in person what we long to see: the one who is called the cornerstone of our salvation (1 Peter 2:7), the Savior we want all the world to know. And I’m not going to lie, I’m a little jealous of that at times. But I also know that there’s a day coming when I’ll get to meet Anna and Simeon, these two faithful servants who had waited so long for their Redeemer to come. And when I do, I’ll get to ask them what that was like. And together we will celebrate not just that He came, but that His work is finally and fully finished.\n\nBut that day isn’t here yet. I get to wait for Jesus to come, too. Because one day, He will return, and whether it’s eighty-four days or eighty-four years from now, I’m going to do my best to keep waiting with expectation, to keep hoping, looking forward to the day when we all get to stand together before Jesus and celebrate all that He has done for us.\n\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong",

    "devo_title": "Mary of Nazareth",
    "devo_summary": "It is easy to think of Mary as a beatific saint, a luminous figure who is borderline supernatural. To view her this way, however, is to so sensationalize her and disconnect her from reality that we dishonor her place in God’s Word. Mary played a pivotal role in the story of redemption, but not because she was extraordinary.\n\nShe was from Nazareth, a tiny town just this side of nowhere. She was a virtuous young woman, a follower of God’s law who was soon to be married. Her fiancé, Joseph, was from the line of King David. While this may sound special, in his day-to-day life he was just a carpenter, not royalty. But he was an honorable and good man, so all signs pointed to Mary having a decent, normal, small-town future raising her family.\n\nWhen the angel, Gabriel, appeared to Mary, everything changed, but she didn’t become a different person. She had been chosen to be the mother of the Messiah. Gabriel called her “favored woman” and told her she would have a son who would be of the line of David and whose kingdom would have no end. He would be called Jesus.\n\nMary’s response gives a glimpse into why she “found favor” in the eyes of God (Luke 1:30). She was troubled when Gabriel called her favored one. She asked, “How can this be?” after being told she would be a mother, but not with the doubt and skepticism of her cousin Zechariah when the angel told him his wife would have a son. He was struck dumb for over nine months (vv.19–20). The angel welcomed Mary’s question and answered, explaining that the Spirit of the Lord would come upon her and something transcendent and miraculous would come about (v.35). When she heard this she did not question further or challenge, she simply replied, “I am the Lord’s servant… May it happen to me as you have said” (v.38).\n\nMary gave birth to Jesus in the meanest of circumstances: a newborn King sleeping in a feeding trough with shepherds as courtiers. But Mary treasured up those things in her heart (Luke 2:19). She raised her son, the Son of God. She knew His business, and when the time came, she gave Jesus the motherly nudge He needed.\n\nThey were at a wedding in Cana, and the wine had run out, meaning the party would be over prematurely. Mary knew her son’s time had come, and she said and did a very motherly thing; she mentioned the problem in passing to Him. When He didn’t promptly act, she then announced to the wedding servants, “Do whatever he tells you,” and walked away (John 2:1–5). She had raised the King, and now she was gently prompting Him to act.\n\nMary was the mother of the Savior, the mother of her own King. She wasn’t extraordinary, but she trusted in her extraordinary God as His humble servant. You and I are not called to the same remarkable miracle she was, but we are called to follow Mary’s example of humility and faith and to live according to God’s Word.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper",

    "devo_summary": "My wife Susie and I got married in June 2013. In April of this year, Susie gave birth to our first child, Maggie. It took a couple of years for us to get pregnant, and throughout that time, it felt as though I was praying every single day for the Lord to give us a child. I struggled with the Lord, asking Him why we weren’t getting pregnant as quickly as our friends were. I am well aware that many couples, including some friends of ours, struggled to get pregnant much longer than we did, and some may never have biological children. But because of my incessant prayer for a child over the years, I see the lives of Zechariah and Elizabeth differently than I did before.\n\nZechariah and Elizabeth are the parents of John the Baptist. But when we meet them in Luke 1, they are faithful followers of the Lord, a priest and his wife, who cannot have children. The Gospel of Luke tells us they “both were righteous in God’s sight, living without blame according to all the commands and requirements of the Lord” (Luke 1:6). They were childless and were well along in age, unlikely to ever have children.\n\nOne day, Zechariah entered the temple to complete his priestly task, and an angel of the Lord appeared to him. It scared him, understandably so, “but the angel said to him, ‘Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will name him John. There will be joy and delight for you, and many will rejoice at his birth’” (vv.13–14).\n\nThe point of Zechariah and Elizabeth’s story isn’t that they eventually gave birth to a son, a child they had likely prayed for countless times over many years—though obviously their son played an important role in the coming of the Messiah. The point of Zechariah and Elizabeth’s story is that God was faithful to work in and through their lives in ways they never could have imagined.\n\nZechariah and Elizabeth served the Lord faithfully, even when their prayers seemed to go unanswered for so long. Even in the face of disappointment, they did not lose hope, and they did not stop asking Him. What about us? Do we continue to hope in Him, to trust Him while we wait for an answer? Do we continue to pray and to seek Him?\n\nWhat do you desperately long for Him to do? Ask Him.\n\nWritten by Chris Martin",

    "devo_summary": "Though the apostle John reminds us that the libraries of the world would fail to contain all the books on Jesus that could be written (John 21:25), the carpenter from Nazareth stands alone as the single subject worthy of the attempt. But Jesus desires faith, not books, and calls disciples, not biographers.\n\nThe whole Bible is about Jesus. Though His name does not appear on a single page of the Old Testament, He is there. He is there at creation, the Word through whom all things were made (Genesis 1:1–31; John 1:1–3). He is there in God’s plan to send a Savior to bruise the serpent’s head (Genesis 3:15; 1 John 3:8). He is there in the promise to bless all nations through Abraham’s offspring (Genesis 12:1–7; Galatians 3:16). He is there in Egypt to rescue His people from the cruelty of Pharaoh (Exodus 12:29–32; Jude 5). He is there in the wilderness, the rock that provided relief for the thirsty (Exodus 17:6; 1 Corinthians 10:4). He is there in God’s promise to David, the King who would sit on the throne forever (2 Samuel 7:16; Luke 1:33). And on and on it goes, from Genesis to Malachi.\n\nWhen we turn the page over to the New Testament, suddenly Jesus is there in the flesh, fully God yet somehow also fully man. The God who made us is also a fellow human, our brother. What could be written about this dual nature of the Son of God could also fill libraries, but again, that is not why we have been called—to fill libraries. We have been called to follow Jesus, to be His disciples. So we must be people who read the stories of Jesus again and again, who soak in His teachings, His parables, His miracles, His life, death, and resurrection. We must be people who see Him even in those passages where He is not named. And we must be Christians, literally “little Christs,” continuing the kingdom work of Jesus in our communities and across the world.\n\nPaul summed it up well when he wrote, “He is before all things, and by him all things hold together” (Colossians 1:17). Not some things or many of the things, but all things. Jesus is there, in everything we read in Scripture, but in everything we experience in this life too. Even in the dark places that seem a million miles removed from Christ, He is there, weeping over our sin-twisted world, drawing near to the brokenhearted, and loving the unlovable. You and I are commanded to make His name known in such places—to invite the lost home and to give all the glory to Jesus. It’s all about Him. Always.\n\nWritten by John Greco",

    "devo_summary": "I’m surprised when I find someone who’s never seen The Princess Bride. I’m embarrassed for them, actually. And I always feel a certain responsibility to make sure they remedy this oversight. Why? Because The Princes Bride is a perfect story, one where nothing is wasted. It has everything: pirates, sword fighting, giants, power-struggles, true love, and rodents of unusual size. Everything.\n\nEsther’s story is perfect too. It has everything. A proud king. A defiant queen. An assassination attempt. An ambitious, venomous second-in-command. A seventy-five-foot gallows in the heart of town, built especially for the sage-like guardian of the beautiful orphan girl who would become queen of the land. Esther has quite a story.\n\nIn the book of Esther, we read about Ahasuerus and his rule over Persia, but Esther’s story runs much deeper and higher. Even though God is not mentioned by name in this book, He is the supreme King and hero of this story. His providential hand leads His people from certain destruction to the kind of safety found only in being the object of the King of king’s affection.\n\nYou should read the book of Esther in one sitting. Enjoy the twists and turns. Appreciate the irony laced throughout. Feel the fear and trembling Mordecai, Esther, and their people must have known as Haman’s gallows took shape. The story itself deserves our appreciation for its complexity, drama, romance, outcome, and humor. (See Esther 6:1–11 for an example of tragic comedy in Scripture. I dare you not to smile, just a little.)\n\nOne of the things I find most refreshing about Esther’s story is her lack of ambition. Greatness is thrust upon her. She finds herself in positions where she has an influential voice, and she uses it. But she never seeks her own glory. She seeks truth and then advocates for the truth to be known.\n\nA story like Esther’s speaks to a bigger truth than the state of Persian politics. She speaks to the truth the apostle Paul describes in his letter to the Corinthians: God uses what is seemingly insignificant and despised in the world to bring to nothing that which is exalted over God (1 Corinthians 1:27–29).\n\nEsther’s life story is a double-edged sword. It is a rebuke to those who are tempted to scheme and plot their way to greatness. But it’s also a story with this reassurance: No matter how powerful the schemes of man may appear, God can topple them in a moment with ease. May that sword cut us both ways for the glory of God.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

    "devo_title": "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego",
    "devo_summary": "Compromise is all around us today. It’s everywhere we look, even the church. The idols of our age tempt us with false promises. And if we reject the promises of sex, power, and money, we may be left out. On the other hand, if we stand by our convictions, we may find ourselves alone. Yet, at the heart of it, the Bible teaches us that this world holds out empty promises that can never fill our souls. When we go with the currents of this world, we may find immediate gratification, but the pleasure will be fleeting and we will be left with nothing but empty hands and broken hearts.\n\nThe story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego is a powerful reminder that conviction trumps compromise every time. When Nebuchadnezzar warned of judgment for not worshiping a man-made image, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego boldly proclaimed their faith in God and would not bow to another. Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “If you don’t worship [the image], you will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire—and who is the god who can rescue you from my power?” (Daniel 3:15).\n\nThese were men of God who did not compromise. The faithful men answered, “If the God we serve exists, then he can rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire, and he can rescue us from the power of you, the king. But even if he does not rescue us, we want you as king to know that we will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up” (vv.17–18).\n\nAnd God did just as they knew He would. After being thrown into the fire, they emerged completely untouched; their clothes and hair were left unsinged, and not even the smell of smoke lingered on them. What a testimony to the comprehensiveness of the Lord’s protection. God often meets His children in the most profound furnaces of life, promising, “You will not be scorched when you walk through the fire, and the flame will not burn you” (Isaiah 43:2).\n\nPerhaps the burning desire to turn to the things of this world is a fire crackling in your heart today. Is God not able to strengthen you to resist compromise? Is our God not able to empower you to resist the temptations that so easily entangle us? The same Jesus who promised to be with us until the end of the age (Matthew 28:20) also taught us to pray, “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one” (Matthew 6:1, NIV). Therefore, be strong. Do not compromise. The reward for faithfulness is infinitely better than the fleeting satisfaction that comes from yielding to this world’s temptations.\n\nWritten by Matt Capps",

    "devo_title": "Daniel",
    "devo_summary": "The Bible is full of imperfect people who wavered in their faith and obedience. Moses led God’s people out of Egypt but first pleaded with the Lord to pick someone else. David was a man after God’s own heart but committed adultery and murder. Elijah asked God to take his life after defeating the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel. Peter was one of Jesus’s best friends and a leader in the early Church, but he also publicly denied the Lord three times. The list could go on and on. But there are a handful of people for whom Scripture records no such mixed reviews. The prophet Daniel is one of them.\n\nThe consistent testimony of God’s Word is that Daniel obeyed the Lord, even under the tremendous pressure that comes with living as a captive in a foreign land. That, of course, doesn’t mean Daniel was without sin. Rather it means that Daniel was a man of unusually strong faith.\n\nThis faith is on full display in Daniel 2. King Nebuchadnezzar has had a dream and wants one of his wise men to interpret it for him. The catch? The interpreter must also tell the king what the dream was about. A seemingly impossible task, the empire’s other wise men quake with fear, especially when the king issues an order for their execution. But not Daniel. Instead of trembling, Daniel and his friends pray.\n\nWhen God answers, Daniel confidently proclaims, “Don’t destroy the wise men of Babylon! Bring me before the king, and I will give him the interpretation” (Daniel 2:24). Daniel knows that the vision he has received is from the Lord and that it will satisfy the king’s request. No doubt about it.\n\nAs Daniel reports, Nebuchadnezzar’s dream was about world empires—his own and three to follow. During the time of the fourth kingdom, a new kingdom arises, unlike the others, and it has no end. The message is simple but important: God is sovereign over world history. Nebuchadnezzar may have thought himself the ruler of his expansive realm, but God is the rightful Ruler of the world.\n\nEven before Daniel received the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, he knew this. It’s why he could behave with such faith while living in Babylon. According to the common beliefs of the day, the gods were territorial. Babylon belonged to Marduk and his pantheon. Yahweh’s territory was the land of Israel. In other words, Daniel’s God should have been powerless to act on Daniel’s behalf while Daniel was in exile. But that isn’t how the world actually works. The one true God knows no boundaries, no territories, and no limits. He is the God of history, sovereign over all peoples, all lands, and all circumstances.\n\nAll too often, my behavior betrays the doubts that reside in my heart. If I really believed that God held every detail of my life in His hands, my first response to trouble would be faith rather than the enacting of some detailed plan to manage things on my own. Daniel’s life is a reminder that there is another way, a way that sees living in a foreign land with other gods not as a hardship but as a training ground for deeper faith. May we all keep this perspective, for we all, like Daniel, are far from home.\n\nWritten by John Greco",

    "devo_summary": "Several years ago, my mother-in-law shared with my wife that she had started eating something called Ezekiel Bread. After explaining its many health benefits, she said, “And it’s even in the Bible!” (We were fairly new Christians at the time, and my mother-in-law was trying to be supportive.) To this, my wife said, “Oh, interesting,” and then looked up the bread in the book of Ezekiel—where she read about how he baked it. Needless to say, after hearing that, I’m pretty sure my mother-in-law never ate it again.\n\nAround that same time, I was in the Christian Books section of my local bookstore, talking to an associate. He mentioned that he was a Christian, and then shared (completely unprompted, mind you) his belief that Ezekiel was obviously describing UFOs and aliens in his visions. I am not exaggerating, not even a little.\n\nAll this to say, the prophet Ezekiel incites a response from people. Too often, people think they’re supposed to focus on the hard-for-us-to-understand imagery in his prophecies, spending potentially far too much time trying to determine what the many-wheeled, many-eyed, and many-winged creatures really are. And while there’s nothing wrong with wanting to understand the imagery, we should be careful to not get so hung up on it that we miss that Ezekiel’s message was meant to be understood.\n\nGod said to Ezekiel, “Son of man, eat what you find here. Eat this scroll, then go and speak to the house of Israel” (Ezekiel 3:1). The Lord instructed the prophet to warn the Israelites that they had become “rebellious pagans” (2:3). God’s rebuke was to be given, regardless of whether or not the Israelites would listen and receive it (2:7; 3:11). With words and actions, Ezekiel then warned the people of God’s coming judgment, and what they would experience when Israel was taken away by the Assyrians into captivity (12:1–6).\n\nAnd even though they didn’t listen, Ezekiel did as God commanded. He spoke a message offering forgiveness and restoration, a plea from God for Israel to turn from her wicked ways and trust in Him. He called them to reject the sin that had ensnared them as a people for generations.\n\nThis is what is so easy for us to miss when we spend our time focusing on the weirder parts of the book, or trying to apply them in ways they were never meant to be applied. What seems strange to us can easily distract us, or even cause us avoid this book altogether. But this book is really good for us! I know I need it, as it shows me just how much I need Jesus. Apart from Christ, I know I am just as wicked and rebellious as any of the Israelites to whom Ezekiel spoke. I know that I would gleefully still be thumbing my nose at my Creator, had Jesus not saved me. And whether or not I listen to it, whether or not I pay attention, this book is still good news, “sweet as honey in my mouth” (Ezekiel 3:3).\n\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong",

    "devo_summary": "King Hezekiah was a man of prayer. Today’s readings contain three of his prayers, and each one is different.\n\nThe first appears in 2 Kings 19:14–19 as Judah faced impending invasion by the Assyrians, who had invaded the land and besieged Jerusalem. When Sennacherib, the Assyrian general, sent a letter full of threats to Hezekiah, the king immediately ran to the temple where he spread the letter out before the Lord. The king’s prayer was bold and public. He begged God to vindicate Himself and show His glory among the nations. Hezekiah was desperate, but he also knew that his prayer was in accordance with God’s stated plans and purposes (2 Samuel 7:23; Psalm 67:1–2). The Lord answered with swift and decisive deliverance (2 Kings 19:35–37).\n\nThe second prayer appears in Isaiah 38:1–2. Once again, Hezekiah faced an imminent threat, though it wasn’t a national emergency this time—it was personal. God’s prophet, Isaiah, diagnosed the king with a terminal illness. Upon hearing the news, the king immediately turned his face toward the corner of his room. Once again, Hezekiah’s prayer was a desperate appeal for deliverance. Hezekiah asked God to remember how he had walked faithfully and wholeheartedly, doing what pleases the Lord (v.2). Hezekiah was a godly king, but I’m certain he also knew his own sin. There was no guarantee God would grant his request. I imagine that’s why, after making that appeal, the king wept so bitterly. God heard his humble anguish, and He extended the king’s life by fifteen years (v.15).\n\nHezekiah’s third prayer appears in Isaiah 38:9–20, and it is offered in response to being healed. In these circumstances, we might expect the king to respond with a poetic song of thanksgiving and praise. The king does write a poem, but it’s surprising, more contemplative than you’d think; he writes a hymn rather than a praise chorus. He does eventually give thanks (v.19), but first, the king reflects on the horror and oppression he felt when facing death (vv.10–14), as well as God’s power to forgive sins and restore life (vv.17–18). The experience sobered him, and it encouraged him to both “walk along slowly” (v.15) and to recount God’s salvation to the next generation (v.19).\n\nI love how each of Hezekiah’s prayers is so unique, each shaped by his changing circumstances. We shouldn’t be surprised if it’s the same for us. But in every circumstance, Hezekiah knew where to turn, and he did not stop asking God for rescue. We can have the same confidence, to turn and take our desperation, tears, deep contemplation, and thanksgiving all to the Lord.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy",

    "devo_summary": "Growing up, I often daydreamed about being married. I learned to cook, thinking I would bless my future wife with my culinary skills. I worked hard to get a good job, hoping to one day provide a nice, comfortable life for my future bride. It was rare for me to go on a date without wondering if the girl sitting across from me might be my future wife. I spent a lot of time dreaming about what marriage would be like, imagining how beautiful it would be. But like so many things in life, God’s plans are bigger and even more beautiful than we could ever conjure up. His ways are better than ours, but that doesn’t mean they’re always easier.\n\nNow, imagine how Hosea must have felt when God gave him this call:\n\n“Go and marry a woman of promiscuity” (Hosea 1:2).\n\nWhy would God call Hosea to faithfully love a woman who would not be faithful to him in return? To offer everything to someone who offered him so little, and then to “go again; show love to a woman who is loved by another man and is an adultress”? (Hosea 3:1). This biblical account only makes sense when we realize that it is not primarily written about Hosea and Gomer. Their marriage is a living metaphor for the faithful love God continuously showers upon His faithless people.\n\nThough His people did not reciprocate His faithfulness, and though they used His gifts to worship false gods such as Baal (Hosea 2:8), God promised to deliver His people from the consequences of their rebellion and to restore them to the blessedness of right relationship with Him. And in framing His promise, God drew upon the metaphor He had established between the faithful husband Hosea and the faithless wife Gomer:\n\n“I will take you to be my wife forever.\n\nI will take you to be my wife in righteousness, \n\njustice, love, and compassion.\n\nI will take you to be my wife in faithfulness,\n\n and you will know the LORD” (Hosea 2:19–20).\n\nThis Old Testament account of the gracious faithfulness of God is good news for the modern-day people of God. We may be living in a different day and age, but the sin nature that defiled the people of Hosea’s day continues to haunt us and lead us astray. It’s as Robert Robinson wrote in his famous hymn “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing,” we are “prone to wander” and “prone to leave” the God we love.\n\nYet as prone as we are to leave Him, God Himself—King Jesus—left the glories of heaven in order to come to earth as a man, live humbly as a servant, and ultimately, die upon a cross (Philippians 2:5–8). In His death and resurrection, Christ won the Church to Himself as His pure, spotless bride (Ephesians 5:25–27). The promise God offered His people in the book of Hosea is fulfilled once and for all time through Jesus Christ.\n\nBecause the gospel is true, the redeemed from all nations will be assembled together as “a bride adorned for her husband” (Revelation 21:2). Though we were faithless, Christ has been faithful. And because this is true, we will dwell with Him forever. The gospel is very good news, indeed, especially for those of us who are prone to wander.\n\nWritten by Davis Lacey",

    "devo_title": "Elijah",
    "devo_summary": "The showdown between Elijah and the prophets of Baal is arguably one of the most exciting stories in the Old Testament. A solitary man stands up against a group of false prophets and proposes a challenge that will prove who the true God is. Elijah was made for encounters like this. He did not accidentally find himself in this position; his whole life had pointed him in this direction.\n\nElijah lived as a man set apart, and John the Baptist in the New Testament lived a life that mirrored Elijah’s. Or perhaps the better way to say it is, Elijah’s life foreshadowed John the Baptist’s. They both wore coats of animal hair and leather belts (2 Kings 1:8; Matthew 3:4). They both fasted in the wilderness for long periods of time (1 Kings 19:8; Matthew 3:1). And they both called Israel to repent.\n\nElijah was a man set apart because his mission was to call Israel to live as a people set apart. His calling was to promote loyalty to God in a pagan culture. Elijah knew Israel had a purpose for existing: to worship God alone, and to make God known to the world. Part of Israel’s call to loyalty included the responsibility to preserve their one true faith. Preserving that faith meant opposing the infiltration of idolatry or the blending of their worship with pagan practices and traditions. This was Elijah’s fight, to preserve the purity of the covenant God established with His people.\n\nIn opposing false prophets, Elijah lived as someone who was always opposed. Apart from the protection of God, he would have been doomed. But as we see in his confrontation with the prophets of Baal, God displayed His power through Elijah’s ministry in ways that not only prevailed over the false prophets, but caused people to think twice before opposing Elijah.\n\nElijah came to be regarded as a symbol of continued faithfulness, a perception aided in part by his strange exit from this world. He did not depart in the traditional way, but was taken up to heaven in a whirlwind of fire. He went up, and he didn’t come down. Israelites anticipated his return. The prophet Malachi even prophesied his return (Malachi 4:5), which was fulfilled in the birth of John the Baptist, who came with a similar mission—to make straight the path of the Lord in a crooked world (Luke 1:17).\n\nElijah’s mission to call God’s people back to the Lord continues on through the finished work of Christ and the local church on earth. Elijah reminds us, as do John the Baptist and Christ Himself, that we are not free-floating in the cosmos, untethered from any sort of belonging. We were made for a relationship with God. It is as St. Augustine said: “Lord, you have made us for yourself, and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in you.”\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

    "devo_summary": "If you’re a sports fan, you know that this is the era of player safety. It’s a time of targeting calls, pitch counts, concussion protocols, and protecting the quarterback. You can call me soft if you want, but I’m glad. I don’t think it’s necessary to put a man’s well-being at risk for the sake of my entertainment. I’m as happy as the next guy when my team wins, but players should be treated as people, not cogs in some championship-producing machine. Changes made for the sake of safety safeguard us. After all, when we care too much about winning, whether in sports or in life, we can run over people on the way to achieving our goals.\n\nYou see, idolatry is inherently dehumanizing. King Ahab and Queen Jezebel are extreme examples, but they show us where our own false worship leads. In the midst of the great drought (1 Kings 17:1; James 5:17), Ahab took his servant Obadiah to search the kingdom and find what little water was left (1 Kings 18:1–6). “Obadiah was a man who greatly feared the LORD” (v.3), and his love for God overflowed into concern for people. He’d hidden a hundred of God’s prophets away in caves, providing them with food and water and protecting them from Jezebel’s madness.\n\nAhab, by contrast, could have cared less about his thirsty people. He searched the kingdom for grass and water so he could keep his horses and mules alive. This wasn’t some modern concern for animal welfare. No, this king cared for his animals, because they were the source of his military and financial strength. His words and actions showed what his heart truly loved. Winning was important. People were not.\n\nTreating people as a means to achieve our goals is evil. In the idol-worshiping lands of the ancient Near East, a king could seize property from any person he wanted. Prosperity was taken by political maneuvering or brute force. But in Israel, an inheritance was a sacred stewardship from God (Leviticus 25:8–17). Ahab’s neighbor, Naboth, knew this. When he rejected the king’s offer to buy his vineyard, he was expressing his faith. Sadly, he became a martyr to Ahab and Jezebel’s covetousness (1 Kings 21).\n\nAhab had a blatant disregard for human life, and he did more evil than any king before him (1 Kings 16:30). But it’s not uncommon for some of us to use degrading and dehumanizing language when talking about someone of another culture, gender, or political persuasion. Over the last couple of years, I’ve been convicted about the subtly dehumanizing words I’ve used to describe athletes. I now try to stop myself before I describe a running back as a “beast,” for instance. Comparing the man who carries the football to a beast of burden feels too much like the dictator’s “collateral damage” or the abortionist’s “tissue.” Maybe I’m overthinking it. Probably so. But my prayer is that God would keep my mouth from degrading speech and my heart from idols.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy",

    "devo_summary": "If you had three wishes for anything in the world, what would they be? Would you choose fame and fortune, perhaps pleasure, or a long life? The “genie in a bottle” scenario that we occasionally fantasize about is appealing. The fun is found in thinking through what we would really ask for. God’s question to Solomon was similar: “Ask. What should I give you?” (1 Kings 3:5). Omnipotent, almighty God offered a blank check. Nothing was beyond His power or ability to supply.\n\nWhat would you ask for?\n\nThe potent self-awareness of Solomon stands out to me. Instead of asking for wealth, long life, glory, power, or domination over his enemies, he asks for wisdom and understanding. He perceives his youthfulness as well as his position of responsibility, and so he asks for the practical discernment of wisdom to lead the people of God well. Most men I know would hardly make the same request if given the opportunity.\n\nSolomon, in these moments, stands as a helpful model for how we think and live. The choices we make have tremendous impact on our lives and on the lives of others. So are we choosing the best things?\n\nEven our small, seemingly inconsequential choices in everyday life are requests in some way. Our decisions reveal what we really value and see as a means to the good life. The route we take in day-to-day life shows what we believe about how we should get there. Will we choose the better things, like wisdom, faith, humility, patience, love, and mercy—or the immediate things, like money, power, and personal pleasure?\n\nWhen we choose to pursue and ask for the greater things, we find the grace of God moving to meet us in them. Solomon’s noble request for wisdom is met with God’s generous response: “I will therefore do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has never been anyone like you before and never will be again” (1 Kings 3:12).\n\nThis kind of gracious blessing is available for us today. As unique as Solomon’s story is, the wisdom God gave him is also available to us. First, in Christ, who is the wisdom of God, we have access to the fullness of God’s wisdom and understanding. Jesus is the greater Solomon, who reveals to us the wisdom of God. Second, all wisdom leads to glorifying God in all of life. Just as Solomon led Israel in worshiping God, so our wise actions lead us to lift up and exalt Him in all things.\n\nFinally, wisdom displays itself in our actions. The gift of God’s wisdom is “pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without pretense” (James 3:17). Let us ask for and pursue His wisdom today.\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol",

    "devo_summary": "Entitlement is a poison of the modern heart. The root is our sinfulness, but the winds of individualism stir our sense of deservedness to a place where we often don’t even recognize it. Oh, how we easily forget that everything we have comes from the hand of God.\n\nContentment is a struggle for many in our society, but contentment is most fully enjoyed by the humble of heart. Humility is a strange state to be pursued. As soon as a man claims to have found humility, he at once reveals his pride. The humble person doesn’t claim anything or demand to be noticed. The humble person is the one who doesn’t interpret every situation primarily by how it affects them. In 2 Samuel, Mephibosheth schools us in this kind of humility.\n\nAs Scripture informs us, Mephibosheth was the son of Jonathan, and the grandson of King Saul. When Mephibosheth was a small child, his father Jonathan was killed in battle. Fearing what the enemy would do to Jonathan’s son, a nurse fled with him to the royal palace in Gibeah. In her haste, the nurse dropped the young Mephibosheth, which resulted in the crippling of both his feet. Thus is the plight of a potential heir to the throne in Israel.\n\nMephibosheth’s humble physical state is often overshadowed by his humble heart, and rightly so. It is moving to consider that Saul’s rightful heir graciously submits to the new king, David. Given the context, these words from 2 Samuel 9 are strikingly beautiful: “So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table just like one of the king’s sons” (v.11).\n\nAt the king’s table. Let that settle in for a moment. He was where he didn’t deserve to be. His seat at the royal table and his presence in the palace weren’t the entitlement of inheritance, but the favor of another.\n\nAs the New Testament reminds us, the Lord shows favor to the humble. In fact, we are called to submit and humble ourselves “under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt us at the proper time” (1 Peter 5:6). Isn’t that a comforting promise? When Mephibosheth was stripped of his physical health and his family inheritance, he remained humble, and God providentially established his place.\n\nIn a society where everyone around us demands their wants and claims their felt rewards, where are the men of humble strength? In a culture of immediate-need pursuits, often at the expense of others, where are the men who are patient at heart? Our God is sovereign over all creation, and He is able to establish His will over the feeble plights of men. Patiently wait on the Lord, be strong and courageous (Psalm 27:14). As Jesus reminds us, “Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted” (Luke 14:11).\n\nWritten by Matt Capps",

    "devo_summary": "Editor’s Note: Some passages in Scripture deal in subject matter which might be especially painful for some readers. Though many of the wounds we receive in this life are deeply personal and unimaginably painful, when they appear in God’s Word, we are reminded that He sees them. Whenever sin is addressed in Scripture—whether through teaching or story—it comes to us in the context of God’s unwavering commitment to bring an end to all evil in this world through the finished work of Christ (Revelation 21:3-4). We are praying for and with you as you read.\n\nAs readers of 2 Samuel, we are told about the lust and selfishness lurking in Amnon’s heart. We overhear Jonadab’s wicked advice to his friend. We know Amnon is only pretending to be sick in order to lure his sister into his bedroom all alone. We know the horrible violation that is coming, and it makes it no less difficult to read Tamar’s story.\n\nI’ve often wondered why this episode is included in Scripture. Sure, it’s a part of David’s story, and it sets the stage for Absalom’s rebellion—but is it necessary to understand redemption history? Would the story of Israel really be incomplete without Tamar’s devastation being repeated and rehearsed every time someone reads through the Old Testament?\n\nNot really.\n\nGod’s promises to Abraham and David would have come true in Christ, whether or not we had ever heard of Tamar. Sin would still be defeated on the cross, and the kingdom of God would still come, had Amnon never sunk to the depravity of demons. But Tamar’s story is there, black text against off-white paper in the middle of my Bible, inviting me to read and ask why God included it in His Word.\n\nBut that’s just it—God did include it in His Word. He breathed it out and made it sacred by incorporating it into Scripture. We should never doubt that God sees our greatest pain—those moments when we are trapped, all alone, without witness or defender. He sees the years that pass afterwards when memories of abuse drive us underground and away from others. He sees, and He is there, bottling up our tears, as the psalmist so poetically put it (Psalm 56:8). The record of 1 Samuel 13 leave us no doubt.\n\nTamar’s story is difficult to read, and I think that’s another reason why it’s included in Scripture. Too often, we flirt with sin, skirting just past the edges of God’s commandments. Other times, we race out head first. But Tamar’s experience puts the ugliness of sin on full display. She is, to use the Bible’s own words, made desolate by the sin of Amnon. And we are all, in one form or another, continually making each other desolate, one sin at a time. I don’t say that to minimize or trivialize the pain of Tamar or any other person who has been sexually abused or violently attacked. There is really no comparison between our everyday sins and tragedies like Tamar’s. My point is, rather, that our sin always has consequences, for ourselves and for the other people in our lives. The sins of others are wounding us, and our own sins are wounding others, all the time. In our sin, we are steadily bringing desolation to one another instead of life.\n\nAnd it is precisely for this reason that Jesus came—to replace desolation and pain with life and joy. During His earthly ministry, Jesus described a time in the future He called “the renewal of all things” (Matthew 19:28). On that day, “grief, crying, and pain will be no more” (Revelation 21:4) and “past events will not be remembered or come to mind” (Isaiah 65:17). That means the shame brought upon Tamar by her brother Amnon does not have the final word. It will, one day, be no more. And in that, there is hope, even in a story like Tamar’s.\n\nToday, let’s thank our God, whose goodness is deeper and wider than even the most abominable of sins our hearts can devise, and let’s pray together for every soul whose ever known the pain of Tamar.\n\nWritten by John Greco",

Whenever sin is addressed in Scripture—whether through teaching or story—it comes to us in the context of God’s unwavering commitment to bring an end to all evil in this world through the finished work of Christ (Revelation 21:3–4). We are praying for and with you as you read.\n\nThe story of David and Bathsheba is full of sin, bloodshed, and death—and the Bible gives a clear assessment of King David’s role in the matter. In his absence from the battlefield, in his adultery with Bathsheba, and in the cold-blooded murder of Bathsheba’s husband, Uriah, “the LORD considered what David had done to be evil” (2 Samuel 11:27).\n\nInterestingly, the Bible passes no such definitive judgment upon Bathsheba. Obviously, Bathsheba’s life was fraught with hardship and tragedy: uninvited sexual advances from the king, which she was powerless to refuse (11:4), an unplanned pregnancy with a man who was not her husband (v.5), the untimely death of her husband at the hands of the king (v.17), and the death of her infant child (12:18).\n\nThough the beginning of their marriage was less than ideal, Bathsheba received comfort from David after the death of their child, and the Lord ordained for her to bring forth another son into the world (12:24). \n\nThat son—Solomon—would later receive the throne of his father (1 Kings 1:30). Bathsheba advocated for her son in this regard, and when Solomon became king, she received the honor due the king’s mother.\n\nAs I read the details of Bathsheba’s life, I wonder what it all means. My own life is constructed of triumphs and tragedies that often seem devoid of greater meaning and purpose. To anyone who has joined me in wondering, What is the meaning of my life? or Why are certain things happening to me? the larger context of Bathsheba’s life offers very good news. \n\nThrough a union she never asked for, the Messiah came into the world; Matthew records that Jesus Christ was born David’s line through Solomon (Matthew 1:6). The Bible’s ultimate judgment upon the life of Bathsheba was that it was of monumental importance to the Father’s redemptive work, not because her triumphs outweighed her tragedies, but because her life was overseen by a Savior whose purposes are always good.\n\nThe same is true of your life as you walk with Christ. You are in His hands as He works through tragedy and triumph, and in all things in between (Romans 8:28). Life by life, the Father is redeeming and restoring the Creation He loves. Will you thank Him today for His faithfulness in all things?\n\nWritten by Davis Lacey",

    "devo_title": "Abigail",
    "devo_summary": "Abigail’s story in Scripture is brief, but it reflects the ministry of Christ.\n\nWhen David and his men were in the wilderness hiding from King Saul, they sought refuge and food at the home of a man named Nabal. Nabal refused their request, insulting David and his men in the process. So David prepared to fight. When Nabal’s wife, Abigail, heard they were coming, she went out to intercept them—to give them supplies and apologize for her foolish husband.\n\nAbigail told Nabal what she had done. When he learned how David had planned to kill him, he had an apparent heart attack, or possibly a stroke, and died ten days later. When David heard about Nabal’s death, he married Abigail and took her into his home.\n\nMany Old Testament figures foreshadow Christ, meaning they illustrate His coming ministry. Abigail is one such person. Looking at this story through the lens of the gospel, David, the righteous and strong king, represents God. And Nabal, the obstinate and intoxicated property owner who was unwilling to welcome in the king—well, he represents us. Abigail, the one who interceded before the king on Nabal’s behalf, represents Christ.\n\nNabal represents the worst in us. The soon-to-be-king asks for food, and Nabal says, in effect, “No. Who does he think he is, asking me to share what’s mine?” He doesn’t just decline David’s request. He does so with contempt. The wage of Nabal’s sin, according to David, is death (1 Samuel 25:12–13).\n\nBut Abigail comes to David on Nabal’s behalf, offering a righteous recompense to atone for Nabal’s prior belligerence. She asks for mercy but also brings an offering to secure it. She says (my paraphrase), “I know my husband is a fool and a rebel, but I’m asking you to receive my offering on his behalf and forgive his trespass” (vv.23–25).\n\nThis is a picture of the work of Christ. The righteous one comes to us, asking for our fidelity and generosity, and we turn away in disgust at the very thought He has any claim on us. But He does have a rightful claim on us and regards our rejection of Him as outright rebellion. Christ intercedes on our behalf, offering His record of perfect righteousness to cover our iniquities, asking the Father to forgive us according to His sacrifice. God receives the offering of Christ on our behalf, and we are delivered.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

    "devo_summary": "Saul was the first Israelite king, but God rejected him and chose young David to replace him (1 Samuel 16:1–13; Acts 13:21–22). Soon Saul recognized David as a rival and a threat, and he mustered an army to smoke David out and destroy him (1 Samuel 22:8). Later, after Saul committed suicide to avoid capture by the Philistines, David ascended to the throne. King David defeated the Jebusites, conquering the fortress of Jerusalem (2 Samuel 5:1–12). After all this, God gave David rest.\n\nScripture says that King David got settled in his palace and God gave “him rest on every side from all his enemies” (2 Samuel 7:1). But David wouldn’t sit still. Alone in his palace, the man of action—a war hero without a war, a statesmen with no opponent—had time to think. Instead of laying back, David looked for the next hill to take. When the prophet Nathan came to visit, David started thinking out loud about his plans: “Look, I am living in a cedar house while the ark of God sits inside tent curtains” (v.2). It seemed strange. God is the great King of kings, so if the earthly king has a mansion, God should have a palace, right? Nathan agreed, “Go and do all that is on your mind, for the LORD is with you” (v.3).\n\nSometimes when circumstances are clear and our motives seem pure and selfless, it hardly seems necessary to pray and seek God’s guidance. It just feels more natural to get to work. David had experienced the high that comes with God’s blessing, but now his busy heart was in danger of getting ahead of God. So God gave Nathan a dream in the middle of the night, and then He sent the prophet back to reject David’s plan. “Are you to build me a house to dwell in?” God asked David (v.5). The implied answer was a clear “no.”\n\nFor David, this message from God must have been jarring. But in reality, it was a great kindness. David didn’t know it at the time, but he needed God to bring his heart peace in much the same way he’d brought peace to the kingdom. The Lord settled David’s heart with three truths.\n\nGod reminded David that He had been good to him:\n\n“I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, to be ruler over my people Israel. I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your enemies before you” (2 Samuel 7:8–9).\n\nGod told David He would be good to him again:\n\n“I will make a great name for you like that of the greatest on the earth” (v.9).\n\nGod promised David that He would always be good to him:\n\n“The LORD himself will make a house for you.… Your house and kingdom will endure before me forever, and your throne will be established forever” (vv.11,16).\n\nWe know this last promise was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. On busy days, when we’re anxious to work hard for God, let’s first settle our hearts in Christ. He has been good to us, and He will continue to be good to those who call Him Lord.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy",

    "devo_summary": "When most of us think about Saul, there’s really only one word that comes to mind: failure. And with good reason. Saul was, to put it delicately, a hot mess. But he seemed to start out well, didn’t he?\n\nAfter Saul was anointed king, God’s Spirit filled him (1 Samuel 10:10), so it’s not as if God wasn’t invested in him. After Saul was presented as king, Samuel declared there was “no one like him among the entire population” (v.24). Saul accomplished a great deal of good early on; he won many battles for his people, leading his army into victory over Israel’s enemies. He had all this going for him—not to mention that he was apparently very handsome, a solid head taller than everyone else in Israel, and charismatic to boot. Yet, he was a complete and total failure.\n\nWhy? There are many reasons, but ultimately, it boils down to one thing: Saul was the king the people wanted. When Israel demanded a king, they wanted one like the kings of the other nations (1 Samuel 8:20), one who would fight their battles for them, rule over them, and act as their judge. But a king like those of the other nations would also be afraid of losing the authority and favor he had with his people.\n\nAnd that’s what Saul was more than anything: afraid to lose his power. He may have hidden among the supplies when he was named king (vv.21–22), but once he was in power, he did anything and everything to keep it—even violating God’s commands by offering a priestly sacrifice (1 Samuel 13:9; Numbers 18:7). As a result, the kingdom he hoped to keep forever was stripped away from him and handed over to another (1 Samuel 13:14).\n\nThere’s probably a warning for us in there, isn’t there? Saul’s failures were big, yes, but we’re no better than him. We can distort the things God has given us to steward. We can become proud and overconfident, fearful of losing our (real or perceived) influence. If we are unaware of our fear and pride, we can easily compromise the way Saul did, doing what is right in our own eyes in the name of serving Christ.\n\nBut Saul’s story is more than a “do better” morality tale with a message that simply says, “Don’t be like Saul.” We need to see his failures for what they are and be honest about our own temptations to do the same. Our failures should make us see our need for Jesus, the King who is better than all the kings of the nations. He is the King who is better than the best humanity has to offer. His kingdom will never fail and never end, because He is seated on His throne forever.\n\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong",

    "devo_summary": "Before the day’s classes began, he took dishwashing soap and proceeded to pour it in several of the fish tanks in his high school biology department. By the time teachers and students arrived to take their places with bright, shining faces, the tanks were, shall we say, bubbly. And the fish, if not already belly-up, were headed to that great aquarium in the sky.\n\nAs is usually the case when it comes to antics like that, somebody who knew the culprit just couldn’t resist telling, and then that person told another, and so on, and so on. Later that day, this guilty guy was summoned to the principal’s office. After agreeing to make some specific amends, and “do some time” in detention, he was sent back to class. But before leaving the principal’s office, my now good friend told me he heard these words: “You know, you’ll never amount to anything.” As it turns out, my friend actually did amount to something; he’s become quite successful.\n\nEli the priest had two sons named Hophni and Phineas. They were both wicked, constantly treating “the Lord’s offering with contempt” and “sleeping with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting” (1 Samuel 2:12,17,22). Needless to say, the behavior of Eli’s sons makes the fish-tank prank look like a Sunday picnic. Clearly, Hophni and Phineas “did not respect the Lord” (v.12). They truly would never amount to anything—at least in the eyes of God. Yet in the midst of this great evil being done among the people, “Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and he fulfilled everything Samuel prophesied” (1 Samuel 3:19).\n\nThe wickedness of Hophni and Phineas stands in stark contrast to Samuel’s goodness and receptivity to the voice of the Lord. On four occasions, the Lord summoned Samuel. The first three times, Samuel thought Eli was calling him. But by the fourth time, Samuel knew it was the Lord. Far from some “you’ll never amount to anything” message, the Lord told Samuel “I am about to do something in Israel that everyone who hears about it will shudder” (v.11). And they were going to hear about it by way of Samuel, the mouthpiece of God.\n\nThe young boy summoned by the Lord amounted to a great deal in the history of God’s people. “All Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was a confirmed prophet of the Lord” (v.20). In God’s economy, what matters most is our ability to listen and our willingness to obey. This truth offers hope for anyone with ears to hear, even for those of us who’ve had occasion to desecrate a fish tank or two.\n\nWritten by John Blase",

    "devo_summary": "There is no one like our God. His character is revealed to us in many forms, from the awe-inducing thunder atop Mount Sinai, to the gentle comfort He brings as He hears our prayers. He is compassionate and remains close to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), and He is also holy, though not as a distant and standoffish deity. Yes, there is a complete otherness to our God, because there is no like Him. No one cares for the brokenhearted—the dejected, the disappointed, the distraught—like Him.\n\nHannah’s life is brutal. Her husband’s heart and life and bed are divided. She doesn’t have all of him. Imagine how crushing this must have been for her. Add barrenness and bullying to the picture and you can see why Hannah’s spirit and appetite were crushed. But the good news for Hannah is that there is a God who listens, and He is full of power, able to answer our prayers. No one is a rock for sinking souls like our God.\n\nIf you’ve never walked through a deep and dark valley, just wait—everyone does at some point (John 16:33). That’s life in a broken world. Doubt grows. Old fears and frustrations push to take up room in our hearts and minds. Suffering invades. I’ve been there, and have learned that there is only one way to keep going. To trust God with our hearts. To believe that, as Hannah prayed, “He guards the steps of his faithful ones” (1 Samuel 2:9). He’s got His people in His hands.\n\nHannah asked God for a son, promising to give him back to the glory and purposes of God. She vowed to give back the one thing she desired most in this world. Whether she ate, drank, or had a son, it was going to be to the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31).\n\nIs that your mode of operation? Your desires and your longings in this life—do they begin and end with you, or do they crest to the cause of our risen Christ? Hannah’s motives were pure. James tell us, “You ask and don’t receive because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures” (James 4:3). Hannah wanted to spend her request toward the fame of God’s name because she believed there is none like Him. This wasn’t just something she knew to be true. It’s a belief she lived out, regardless of her circumstances. Hannah trusted God with her heart’s deepest longings, and she learned to rejoice in Him always and in all things (Philippians 4:4–7).\n\nWritten by J.A. Medders",

    "devo_summary": "I was a kid when I first saw the movie Back to the Future. You probably know the film—Marty McFly travels back to 1955 in a borrowed time machine and accidentally keeps his parents from meeting and falling in love. He then has to figure out how to get his mom and dad together or else he’ll never be born. And he has to do this all the while trying to harness a bolt of lightning so that he and his DeLorean time machine can get back to the present.\n\nIt’s a great movie, but I sat in the back of a dark room alone and cried that first viewing. I had just found out my parents were getting a divorce, and so my fragile heart just couldn’t handle the idea of Marty racing against the clock to put his family back together, no matter how fantastical the premise of the movie. I’d have done anything to put my own family back together.\n\nCentral to the story of Naomi and Ruth is a broken family, though theirs was not broken by divorce or time travel. Instead, their husbands died in the land of Moab. Ruth, a Moabitess herself, left everything familiar behind to accompany her mother-in-law, Naomi, back to Bethlehem, the hometown of her deceased husband, Elimelech. But the two women were equally destitute. In those days, a woman without a father or a husband to provide for her was almost certain to spend the remainder of her days in abject poverty. Add to this the fact that this story takes place during the time of the judges, a period in which “everyone did whatever seemed right to him” (Judges 21:25), and it becomes plain: Naomi and Ruth were at the mercy of strangers.\n\nBut they were also at the mercy of God. And God is full of mercy.\n\nBoaz may have been the one to marry Ruth. He may have even been the one to restore the line of Elimelech. But it was God who redeemed the family. “The women said to Naomi, ‘Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you without a family redeemer today. May his name become well known in Israel’” (Ruth 4:14).\n\nWe are all part of a broken family—broken since the first bite was taken from the forbidden fruit in\n\nthe garden. In sin, we are alienated from one another and from our Father in heaven. But God provided a Family Redeemer for us in Jesus Christ. He has shown kindness to us in our desperation, and He is bringing restoration to our splintered family tree. “Look, I am making everything new,” He says (Revelation 21:5). Because of Jesus, we have a future filled with hope. No DeLorean or lightning bolt required.\n\nWritten by John Greco",

    "devo_summary": "When I was seventeen, a pastor told me I reminded him of Gideon from the Bible. Looking back, I’m pretty sure he meant that God would use me to do big things, but at the time I could only remember the part of Gideon’s story where he asked God to perform a minor miracle with a fleece. In my mind, it showed a lack of faith on Gideon’s part, an audacious attempt to test God. I was naturally offended. \n\nI believed the gospel. I believed in the goodness and the power of God. I believed He had a plan for my life. And if He commanded me to do something—no matter how difficult or dangerous—I’d do it. No questions asked. I didn’t need God to show me any miracle as a prerequisite. I had faith.\n\nSince those obnoxious teenage years, I’ve wanted to wake up to sopping wet fleeces more times than I can count. I’ve been uncertain about God’s direction. I’ve wanted my doubts appeased. I’ve wanted to witness a miracle or two to quicken my wilting faith. Now, instead of seeing Gideon as weak, I see him as human—someone just like me.\n\nAfter those two nights with the fleece project, Gideon obeyed the Lord and did what he was told, even when it seemed silly (like the whole troop selection process that involved choosing men who drank their water like dogs). But nowhere in the story are we given permission to think that Gideon’s victory over the Midianites had anything to do with his own skill or strength. Gideon’s “army” of three hundred men defeated their enemies because God fought for them. Gideon’s obedience was not a condition for the saving of Israel, as if God needs any human being to accomplish His purposes. In that light, the episode with the fleece is an invitation, God saying, “Gideon, join me in what I am about to do!”\n\nI don’t believe we are supposed to read Gideon’s story as a template for discerning God’s will or learning to follow Him through life’s more difficult challenges. Rather, we are to read Gideon’s story for what it is: an account of the way God chose to meet one particular man at one particular time in history. The Lord knew Gideon’s mind and precisely what he needed to step out on the road before him. God granted Gideon a fleece (twice) because that was the way His perfectly good heart would best meet Gideon’s failing heart. But what is best for one person is not best for every person.\n\nGod is good all the time, and while He makes no promise of miracle-provisions to smooth over our doubts, He invites us to come to Him with our rough edges and our questions. As Jesus once told a group of scribes and Pharisees, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners” (Mark 2:17). Thankfully, we serve a God who didn’t wait for us to have our acts together. \n\nWritten by John Greco",

    "devo_summary": "In college, I took a course on rhetorical theory. I honestly can’t recall why I signed up for this particular class; it must have fulfilled some core curriculum requirement. For the purposes of this story, I want to emphasize the theory part. There was never supposed to be any public speaking—just studying the classical forms of rhetoric and persuasive speech. But about two weeks after I could drop the class without consequence, the professor had a “wonderful idea” for an assignment that would really cement what we were learning in our textbooks: a speech in front of the whole class.\n\nI decided to make my ten-minute talk about the separation of church and state, and what that means for Christians in the public square. I spent hours in the library researching my topic and writing notes on index cards. By the day of my speech, I was sure I had my arguments nailed down. I was ready to go. But then, when I got behind the lecturn, I froze. I looked down at my cards and couldn’t read my own writing. In about three minutes flat, I stuttered, stumbled, and otherwise bumbled my way through the talk I’d prepared. I’m sure I left out several points I’d meant to make, and judging by the looks on the faces in that room as I walked back to my seat, I’m not sure what I said made any sense at all.\n\nThankfully, my professor was gracious in his grading, remembering that the initial syllabus for the course required no such public speaking. But the whole experience left me a bit shyer and more reserved. To this day, I don’t like speaking up in meetings unless I’m very comfortable with the other people in the room. When I’ve been asked to preach or teach, it takes every ounce of focus and energy I can muster to see it through.\n\nThis fear of failure has made me very sympathetic toward Barak. We’re not told precisely why he didn’t act when God called him to gather an army and face the Canaanites. We just know that Deborah called him out (Judges 4:6–7). Barak was reluctant but agreed to obey the Lord, but only if Deborah would go with him. Because of this request, Barak lost out on a blessing that could have been his. “‘I will gladly go with you,’ [Deborah] said, ‘but you will receive no honor on the road you are about to take, because the Lord will sell Sisera to a woman’” (v.9).\n\nIn the end, the victory was Barak’s and Deborah’s together. The song of praise that comprises chapter five of Judges credits them both: “Awake! Awake, Deborah! Awake! Awake, sing a song! Arise, Barak, and take your prisoners, son of Abinoam!” (Judges 5:12). And the chief prize, the defeat of Sisera, commander of the Canaanite army, was taken by Jael, a woman who knew two things: that it’s always wise to be on God’s side in any conflict, and… how to wield a tent peg.\n\nGod didn’t need Barak, or Deborah, or Jael to defeat the Canaanite army oppressing the Israelites. He could have obliterated it with a single thought. But like He has done throughout redemption history, He chose to use His human image-bearers to bring about His purposes. We may not be asked to stand down a thundering horde of chariots, but God has called us to advance His kingdom, testify to the truth of the gospel, and do good to everyone we meet. Let’s not hesitate. Let’s not be afraid of failure. God will still get the victory if we falter, but we might miss out on a blessing God has in store for us if our obedience is an afterthought rather than a reflex.\n\nWritten by John Greco",

    "devo_summary": "One of the greatest biblical heroes of faith is a woman whom Scripture constantly names “the prostitute” (Joshua 2:1, 6:17,22,25; Hebrews 11:31; James 2:25). Though a woman of notorious disrepute in Jericho, Rahab became a recipient of the saving grace and mercy of God, and so served the purposes of God in delivering His spies and her own family. What was it that made the unlikely and unexpected difference in this woman’s life, enabling her to align herself with the people of God? In short, it was the message of God’s deliverance of His people from the bondage they experienced in Egypt.\n\nThe close connection between the exodus and the conquest provides the platform for understanding what God was doing in the life of Rahab, the prostitute. When the spies first entered the promised land, Rahab hid them from the king of Jericho. While hiding them, she said:\n\n“I know that the LORD has given you this land… For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two Amorite kings you completely destroyed across the Jordan. When we heard this, we lost heart, and everyone’s courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on earth below” (Joshua 2:9–11).\n\nJames tells us that Rahab acted in faith in receiving, hiding, and sending the spies out another way (James 2:25). She heard about the God of Israel and believed that He was the God of saving deliverance. She trusted that He would give His people an inheritance in Canaan. In turn, God spared Rahab and her household.\n\nOne of the marvelous truths in redemptive history is that Rahab became the great-great-grandmother of King David—the covenantal progenitor of the Redeemer, Jesus Christ (Matthew 1:5–6). Jesus Christ, the sinless Son of God, who came into the world to secure the promises of God given to Abraham and to confer upon His people the everlasting inheritance (Luke 22:29), redeemed a broken woman like Rahab. Who among us can doubt the greatness of the mercy and grace of God in Christ! Truly we can conclude that where our sin increases, His grace is multiplied even more (Romans 5:21).\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig",

    "devo_summary": "In just a few months I’ll be climbing one of the most iconic landmarks in the United States: Half Dome in Yosemite National Park. Just thinking about the climb, I feel anxious. I want to make it to the top. I want to remind my body that, even at 40 years old, I’m not done with significant physical endeavors. I want to be able to say that I have put my mind, body, and heart toward a significant goal, and have seen it all the way through. From the inception of the plan to its conclusion and success, I want to see this thing, this climb, all the way through.\n\nIn many ways, this is the story arc of Joshua. Although not a perfect man by any stretch, his life resonates with a theme Eugene Peterson described as, “a long obedience in the same direction.” As the torch of leadership in Israel is passed from Moses to Joshua, a daunting task stands in front of this new leader—to transition God’s people from the desert into the Promised Land. Joshua’s legacy stands or falls on his effectiveness in fulfilling this task.\n\nThat kind of immense responsibility would cause anyone to have anxiety, and maybe just a little heartburn. The responsibility of bringing God’s people into the rest of the promised land loomed large over Joshua’s life. Perhaps we can understand why he would feel timid and weak. Yet the responsibility of carrying out this feat wasn’t Joshua’s to accomplish on his own. Left to himself, Joshua most likely would’ve had about a zero percent chance of success. Yet the presence of God stood over him all the way along, just as God promised it would:\n\n“Haven’t I commanded you: be strong and courageous? Do not be afraid or discouraged, \n\nfor the LORD your God is with you wherever you go” (Joshua 1:9).\n\nWhen we read about Joshua’s success in Joshua 23, we need to remember that the victory was not brought about by his own ability or strength. Joshua’s success was the result of his faith in the promises of God and the assurance that He would be present with His people. Every one of His promises was fulfilled; not one of them failed (Joshua 23:14).\n\nReaching the finish line of our faith may feel like summiting a peak that’s just too tall. Yet Joshua’s life can deeply encourage us in our steps today. We can trust the promises of God to get us to the finish line. The encouragement to “be strong and courageous” comes with the empowerment of the gospel, that Christ has already climbed the mountain for us. The One who defeated sin and conquered death will be faithful to bring us into the kingdom He has prepared for us.\n\nBy trusting in the promises of God, we can take that next step in faith, in whatever situation or circumstance, knowing that Christ will not leave us or forsake us, but will bring us all the way to glory. So, believe! Be strong and courageous.\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol",

    "devo_summary": "Jean de Chelles is a name not many were familiar with until April 15, 2019. On that day, due to the interconnectedness that social media allows, the watching world held its breath as a structure fire broke out beneath the roof of Notre-Dame Cathedral, the 850-year-old Gothic structure that is one of France’s most famous landmarks. Although any aspect of that architectural marvel that burned would constitute a loss, many were focused on the famed rose windows. The North Rose Window was constructed around 1270, and the architect was one Jean de Chelles.\n\nWhile interest in his name has resurfaced, it will no doubt fade again as restoration begins on the Cathedral and people return to their everyday lives. And this is okay. The legacy the artist left is not his name—it is the window.\n\nWhen’s the last time you heard a sermon, attended a Bible study, or sat in on a Christian conference session where the subject of discussion was a man named Bezalel? Yeah, me either. I think the answer is “never.” But the book of Exodus reminds us of this craftsman who God commissioned to bring his talents and skills to bear in the construction of the tabernacle. According to the text, Bezalel was quite the artisan, working in mediums of gold, silver, bronze, the cutting of stone, and the carving of wood. In other words, this guy was good, and understandably so, as God Himself “filled Bezalel with [His] Spirit, with wisdom, understanding, and ability in every craft” (Exodus 31:3).\n\nThese facts, plus a little family history—“the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah”—are all we know of this man. He did have a partner in this artistic endeavor, a man named “Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan,” but we know nothing beyond that. But when it comes to the tabernacle, this physical dwelling place for God’s Spirit? Well, we know quite a bit, and this structure looms large in an understanding of God’s work in the Old Testament. Somewhat like de Chelles, Bezalel’s name is important, but the more important aspect is the work of art he was commissioned to contribute to the tabernacle.\n\nShould anyone think God doesn’t care about art and architecture, and furthermore about excellence in such matters, there are pages of Scripture which mention rather forgettable men who worked on unforgettable wonders. Bezalel is one of those men, a man filled with God’s Spirit and gifted with skills that would draw attention to the majesty and glory of God.\n\nWritten by John Blase",

The front row offers the best views. Sitting close lets me see in better detail the events in front of me. It also offers me the opportunity to be more involved in whatever it is I’m watching in some way. There’s a responsibility that comes with getting the front row seats.\n\nMiriam may be a rather obscure person in the Bible, but her contribution to the story of God and His people is significant. Her courage to stand and watch to see what would happen to her infant brother, Moses, as he floated in a small basket down the river shows us a woman of compassion (Exodus 2:4). Her boldness to approach Pharaoh’s daughter and ask if a Hebrew woman could nurse the baby for her, and then to get the baby’s mother to do so demonstrates wisdom in applying the providence of God to daily life (vv.7–8).\n\nYet, apart from this brief appearance in the beginning of Moses’s story we don’t hear much about Miriam. But she is there. Like the rest of Israel, Miriam endured the harsh conditions of Egyptian slavery. She saw the unparalleled power of God from the front row as the plagues descended upon Egypt, one after the other. She probably had meal-time conversations with Moses and Aaron about what God was doing in the midst of these monumental events. She trusted God in the midst of the Passover, posted the blood above her door, and was ready to leave Egypt as the command came. She marched with Israel on the way to the Promised Land while the great Red Sea stood in their path.\n\nExodus 14 tells us she was there when God ripped the sea in two and them to walk on dry ground with an ocean barrier in front and an Egyptian army behind. She was there when the water swallowed up her enemies. She sat on the front row as God powerfully poured out His mercy and grace on Israel and rescued them from their slavery. The details were riveted in her heart and mind.\n\nIt makes sense then that from the front row she led the Israelits in praise. Miriam may be one of the first worship leaders in the Bible. There, with tambourine in hand and a praise choir of women alongside, she sang a new song of worship to God: “Sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted; he has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea” (Exodus 15:21). The front-row seat brought a great opportunity to participate in the moment of praise to God.\n\nMiriam’s life asks me (and perhaps you) this question: Where has God allowed me a front-row seat to see His glory and then offer Him praise, all because I’ve seen the details up close and perhaps better than anyone else? May we learn to worship and lead others to do the same, because we have seen Him do great and mighty things.\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol",

    "devo_summary": "Growing up, I thought people like Moses, Aaron, David, Samson, and Elijah were the heroes of the Bible. They are not. The Bible has one hero—Christ. All the other key characters God uses—and uses mightily to change the world, by the way—are filled with complex sin, moral collapse, and obtuse immaturity.\n\nAaron, Israel’s first High Priest, is no exception. We meet him when he becomes stammering Moses’s mouthpiece—speaking hard words to a hardened Pharaoh. He serves alongside Moses throughout the Exodus from Egypt, holding up Moses’ arms both literally and figuratively.\n\nAaron saw the power of God firsthand in ways few others in Scripture ever witnessed. God set Aaron and his family apart to serve as Israel’s priesthood—the people who would stand in as mediators between God and man. They were imperfect versions of what Christ would do perfectly.\n\nAaron’s failures were epic. He led the people in crafting a golden calf to worship when it seemed Moses would not be coming down from Mount Sinai any time soon. Then he denied personal responsibility with one of the greatest lines of obfuscation in Scripture, “I threw [the gold] into the fire, and out came this calf” (Ex 32:24).\n\nAnd yet, God continued to work through Aaron and his family. They continued to serve as priests for the people of God, offering sacrifices on Israel’s behalf, teaching them God’s Law, and maintaining a culture of worship.\n\nBut there was only so much an imperfect priest could do. They could warn Israel of their sin. They could remind them of their past histories with idolatry. They could take them through the stories of the generations before who had, without exception, all at one point or another embraced the gods of their neighboring countries. They could implore, threaten, pray, and appeal. They could pound their fists on their pulpit. They could plead from their knees. They could sing in the sweetest whisper of a lullaby.\n\nBut one thing they could not do. They could not make Israel holy. They could warn them of their proclivity to sin, but they could not take it from them. They could vividly predict their certain coming guilt, but the priest could not take it away. They could lead many of the sons of Israel to think, but they could not lead any sons to glory (Heb 2:9-10). Only Christ could do that—our truer and better High Priest, the hero of Scripture. And this is exactly what He does.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

    "devo_summary": "In his final sermon, deacon and first Christian martyr, Stephen, described Moses as being “no ordinary child” (Acts 7:20, NIV), “beautiful in God’s sight” (CSB). You see, “Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in his speech and actions” (v.22). Powerful in speech and actions! If you’ve read Moses’s story, those are amazing words.\n\nWhen God first called Moses at the burning bush, the Israelites were in great need of a deliverer. A new king had come to power in Egypt, one who dealt treacherously with the Israelites and oppressed them by forcing them to “abandon their infants outside so that they wouldn’t survive” (Acts 7:19). God explained that He would work through Moses to rescue the Israelites from slavery, but at that moment, Moses was far from powerful in his speech or action.\n\nGod’s call on Moses to speak for the vulnerable in the face of great political power left him afraid to say or do anything. Instead, he stammered and complained again and again, telling God he was not up to the task:\n\n“Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” (Exodus 3:11).\n\nAnd—\n\n“What if they won’t believe me and will not obey me but say, ‘The LORD did not appear to you’?” (4:1).\n\nBut—\n\n“Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent—either in the past or recently or since you have been speaking to your servant—because my mouth and my tongue are sluggish” (v.10).\n\nMoses was a faltering mess, but God answered every one of his objections. He told Moses, “Now go! I will help you speak, and I will teach you what to say” (v.12). God kept that promise too. He gave Moses His Holy Spirit, who strengthened Moses to testify before the king and perform miraculous signs (Isaiah 63:12). Because of the Spirit’s work through him, Moses became the people’s public advocate, a prophet and leader who was truly mighty in word and deed!\n\nLater in his life, Moses predicted that God would raise up for the Israelites another prophet like him (Deuteronomy 18:15,18; Acts 7:38). Moses looked forward to Jesus, the greater prophet who was “powerful in action and speech” (Luke 24:19). When we were helpless, Jesus spoke up for us. When we were oppressed by sin and death, He went to the cross to deliver us.\n\nAnd now, by His Holy Spirit, we can speak up for and act on behalf of others as well. Just as God gave Stephen the strength to speak the truth and show compassion in the face of great hostility, the Spirit will also teach us what to say and fill us with His great mercy (Matthew 10:19–20) .\n\nFather, make us bold, powerful in speech and action. Amen.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy",

    "devo_summary": "In our celebrity-driven, media-immersed culture, we need to be reminded that often the real heroes are those living faithfully in obscurity, enacting their faith in God in ways that are costly to them and unpopular in their culture. Such were Shiphrah and Puah, the two midwives who disobeyed the command of Pharaoh regarding the slaughter of the Israelites’ male infants. These two women defied the most powerful empire in the world at the time, because they feared God more than they feared Pharoah.\n\nIn every generation, believers are tempted to do things that are culturally acceptable, even “world changing” by earthly standards, without realizing that God may want them to stand against the masses and bring about change—which can sometimes mean doing some culturally unacceptable and very unpopular things.\n\nShiphrah and Puah must have felt an enormous temptation to compromise their integrity in exchange for perceived safety and security. If they defied Pharaoh, it could cost them their lives. However, Moses tells us these women “feared God” and refused to kill the male infants. They respected the preservation of life in their hearts and acted in faith, believing that the God of Israel would be faithful to them.\n\nThese women did not compromise or bend to the wicked dictates of Pharaoh, and the result of their faithful service is astonishing. Their actions resulted in the preservation of Moses, and ultimately, Jesus Christ—coming Messiah, new (and lasting) covenant Mediator, and Savior of the world. God also rewarded the midwives with families of their own (Exodus 1:22).\n\nThe Lord not only protected these courageous women, but also His promise to send a Redeemer into the world to rescue a people from every nation, tribe, and tongue (Revelation 7:9). May we also commit ourselves to doing the unpopular and costly acts of faithfulness, in the obscurity of our everyday lives and without an audience. We may never see the immeasurable fruit that God brings about on account of our courageous faithfulness, but we can be sure that He will be with us as we seek to live and act in faith according to His word and promise.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig",

    "devo_title": "Potiphar’s Wife",
    "devo_summary": "The biblical text is brimming with names, many of them extremely difficult to pronounce. But the point is, there are specific names on almost every page of Scripture. So it always interests me when I come across a man or woman who is unnamed. That’s exactly what we find with the woman at the center of today’s story. She is only known in Scripture as “his master’s wife.” Joseph corresponds to “his,” and Potiphar is the “master”; she is simply “wife,” a woman with no name. But her story is far from simple. And should you choose to read it through some of the cultural filters at work in our day, the story grows even more complex.\n\nHere’s the CliffsNotes version: Potiphar was an Egyptian officer, a captain in fact. Though a slave, Joseph was an up and comer. “The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man” (Genesis 39:2), and Potiphar took notice. So Potiphar put Joseph in charge of his household, everything that he owned. In that household was a wife who took a liking to “well-built and handsome” Joseph, and said to him, “Sleep with me.” She made the plea more than once, and each time Joseph refused. His question to her, in addition to breaking trust with Potiphar, was, “How could I do this immense evil, and how could I sin against God?” (v.9).\n\nFor God has not called us to impurity but to live in holiness (1 Thessalonians 4:7).\n\nThe final proposition scene ended with Joseph running out of the room while Potiphar’s wife was left holding his garment. Yeah, not a good look in biblical times or now. She accused Joseph of trying to take advantage of her, Potiphar believed his wife, and Joseph ended up in prison.\n\nIn one sense this could be the script for a made-for-TV movie. Pretty straightforward, really: It’s the story of a frustrated wife who is suddenly taken with the pool boy. The “he said, she said” game never ends well, for anyone involved. But this story contains a line seldom, if ever, heard in TV movies: “But the LORD was with Joseph.”\n\nAt first blush it appears a woman is at the center of this story. But upon closer inspection, it’s clear that a larger, grander character is the axis for these scenes. This character has a name: the LORD. Joseph’s life, though not without conflict and hardship, is kept secure in the LORD’s hands. And while the LORD does not bless him solely because of his integrity, Joseph’s refusal to undermine Potiphar’s trust and sin against God shows his steadfast devotion to the Name above all names.\n\nWritten by John Blase",

You aren’t going to be a pastor. You aren’t marrying that girl from the coffee shop. Kids? You can’t even get to work on time. Good luck with that.” Of course, ten-years-ago me was a moron. He didn’t know what he didn’t know.\n\nThe dreams God gave Joseph set him on a winding, bumpy, spiraling path that led to rock bottom. Literally. From being thrown into a pit and sold into slavery, to being imprisoned in Egypt—Joseph’s life was the pits, but God was with him.\n\nThrough Joseph’s wisdom and gifting, he was eventually brought out of prison and promoted to be Pharaoh’s right-hand man. Do you think in-the-pit Joseph ever could have foreseen this? Sure, Joseph had seen a glimpse of what was in his future, because God had shown him in a dream. But he didn’t know how all the gaps would be filled in, what would happen in between prison and the vision God had given him. When a famine in the region led to Joseph’s family bowing down before him, honoring and thanking him for the provisions given to them, Joseph’s vision came true—but only because God is faithful.\n\nBrothers, there are all kinds of dreams and hopes we have for our lives. Some of them will come true. Many won’t. But God hasn’t promised to meet all of our wishes. He’s promised to love us. He’s promised to transform us into the image of His Son, the crucified and risen Lord (2 Corinthians 5:17). Trials happened to Jesus, so yeah, they will happen to us as well (John 16:33). Between the good and bad, the known and unknown, we need to learn to trust God with the gaps in our lives, come what may. He never forgets us. He is always with us.\n\nJesus was betrayed by one of His brothers, too—His disciple Judas. He was brought low and lifted up at the cross. Jesus was locked in the prison of death, but up from the grave He arose and ascended to the Father’s right hand, where He reigns and rules over the universe. What men meant for evil, God meant for good—in Joseph’s life, in Jesus’s life, and in our lives, too (Romans 8:28).\n\nWritten by J.A. Medders",

    "devo_title": "Jacob",
    "devo_summary": "If Jacob had played professional baseball, he’d have been the sort to use performance-enhancing drugs. If he were a pop star, the scandal might have been lip-syncing to someone else’s vocals. And if he were a businessman, no one would be surprised to read about charges of tax evasion in the Wall Street Journal. Jacob is a cheater, a schemer, a bender and breaker of the rules. He’s opportunistic, always looking out for number one. And yet, God chooses him to be the namesake and father of the twelve tribes of Israel.\n\nWhen we first encounter Jacob in the biblical narrative, he’s still in utero—and he’s already scheming to get ahead! He clutches his older brother’s heel, as if trying to keep Esau from being born first and receiving the corresponding privileges. This pattern continues throughout Jacob’s life, whether he’s serving up stew to trade for Esau’s birthright, tricking his father, Isaac, into giving him the blessing of the firstborn, or trying to one-up the deceitfulness of his father-in-law, Laban.\n\nIt is to this con artist that the Lord reveals Himself. At Bethel, when Jacob dreams of a stairway to heaven, God “was standing there beside him, saying, ‘I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac’” (Genesis 28:13). This prompts Jacob to respond, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it” (v.16).\n\nYears later, God visits Jacob again, this time in the form of a man who wrestles with him until daybreak. In this strange scene, the character of Jacob collides with the goodness of God. While Jacob says, “I will not let you go unless you bless me” (Genesis 32:26), the Lord does not overpower Jacob but gives him a loving reminder of this moment, when he came face to face with God (see v.30): He touches Jacob’s hip and leaves him with a life-long limp. With every step, Jacob would know that God is real—He had touched Him, heard His voice, and been blessed by Him. It was enough to turn Jacob, the “heel-grabber,” into Israel, the one who “struggles with God” (v.28).\n\nIt’s that struggle that sets Jacob apart. In the same way that he would do anything to get ahead, he would also do anything to receive the blessings of God. (Contrast this attitude to that of Esau, who sells his birthright for a quick meal.) Jacob’s actions and ethics for much of his life do not align with the will of God as later revealed in the law of Moses and Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7). But Jacob is passionate about God’s favor, and in the center of that passion is faith. God uses that faith to make a nation to bless the whole world. In Jesus, we stand today as recipients of that blessing.\n\nJacob is no hero. God is the hero of his story, just as He is the hero of every chapter of the Bible. But Jacob is an example of tenacity. As I read the account of Jacob, I have to ask myself, How badly do I want the blessings of God—to know Him and walk with Him daily? There are few questions more important than this one.\n\nWritten by John Greco",

    "devo_summary": "It doesn’t take a load of possessions in order for our hearts to become possessed by greed. We don’t need many gifts in order to convince ourselves that we are more blessed than others. This is so clear in Rachel’s disposition toward her sister, Leah. Both women, sisters bound to the same husband, lived in a constant state of competition with one another, each trying desperately to bear Jacob’s offspring.\n\nIn the race to bear children, Leah was clearly winning, having already brought forth sons for Jacob. Rachel, on the other hand, was in a state of discouragement and frustration because of her barrenness. Instead of trusting the Lord for children, she said to Jacob, “Give me children or I die” (Genesis 30:1). Like each of has at one time or another, Rachel was trusting in human strength for what God alone could give. Her complaint revealed the true condition of her heart.\n\nInstead of crying out to God to give her children, Rachel turned to her husband. She gave her handmaiden, Bilhah, to her husband, hoping she would be able to bear children in her place. After Bilhah bore Jacob a second son, Rachel confessed, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son” (v.6). Rather than appealing to the covenant-keeping name of God, Yahweh, she employed God’s generic name. This, too, revealed a lack of trust in the covenant God of promise.\n\nAgain, Rachel gave Bilhah to her husband, and again, the servant bore a child. Afterward, Rachel declared, “In my wrestlings with God, I have wrestled with my sister and won” (v.8). This may sound like a cry of triumph, but in reality, it is a cry of vengeance and pride. Theologian John Calvin described Rachel’s false sense of victory this way: “In Rachel the pride of the human mind is depicted… But they who are puffed up with pride have also the habit of malignantly depreciating those gifts which the Lord has bestowed on others, in comparison with their own smaller gifts.”\n\nThough most of us would insist that we would never say such a thing, we’ve all have made similar statements in one way or another. We’re all prone to trust in our own strength and plans rather than in the God of promise. When our chief desires are for success, status, satisfaction, or superiority, rather than God Himself, we’re tempted to boast in every small, weak, and inferior advancement we make in life. Rachel reveals the flaw in our thinking and the frailty of our sinful, human hearts. If left to ourselves, we so often settle for the lesser things in life when God offers so much more. He offers Himself to us through the Son of Jacob, Jesus Christ. May we to turn to Him, to the place where all our striving ceases and every longing is fulfilled.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig",

    "devo_summary": "It is the quintessential high school drama. Two teenage boys, friends, but both are infatuated with one girl. The girl chooses one, and passes over the other. It’s almost a rite of passage for young men, isn’t it, learning to deal with rejection? Coping with the sight of the girl you wanted to be yours, cuddling up beside your friend.\n\nThis situation plays itself out in dozens of ways throughout our lives. It happens when the coach benches you and plays someone else. It is experienced when a co-worker is offered the promotion or job that you so desired. This type of rejection can cause one to feel ignored, unwanted, or even unloved.\n\nThese life situations give us an experiential understanding of Bible narratives. These experiences help us to not only grasp the story on a deeper level, but they also help us feel the pain of those we read about. They help us enter into the story.\n\nAs we reflect on Genesis 29, it helps us read between the lines and anticipate what is going to happen next. The Scripture introduces the drama with clear indicators: “Now Laban had two daughters: the older was named Leah, and the younger was named Rachel. Leah had tender eyes, but Rachel was shapely and beautiful” (vv.16–17).\n\nFrom the very beginning of the story, Jacob was infatuated with Rachel. This makes perfect sense: Rachel was beautiful. But under the veil of night, Jacob was deceived into marrying Leah, the sister with tender eyes. It is made clear in the text that both Laban and Jacob favored Rachel.\n\nHowever, the Lord saw that Leah was hated. In the Old Testament the language “hated” often refers to being passed over and is not always an indicator of animosity. Even so, their treatment of Leah causes God to favor her over Rachel. Rachel is barren, but Leah becomes the mother of many tribes.\n\nWhat becomes abundantly clear in this story is the fact that God sees Leah’s neglect, He hears her cries, and He turns her sorrow into praise. Regardless of how Laban and Jacob treated her, Leah knew that God had shown her kindness.\n\nOur God is not a distant deity. We are often reminded of this comforting truth when no earthly comforts are afforded us. In fact, it is often the most bitter of circumstances that sweeten His presence all the more. When we cannot have the love we want, we are most deeply assured that God’s love is all we need.\n\nWhen we are passed over and rejected, it is important to remember that God has not left us or forsaken us. He may be doing something in and through our situation that we cannot imagine. But in time, we may be able to look back in retrospect and praise His name. The Lord has tender eyes for His troubled children.\n\nWritten by Matt Capps",

    "devo_summary": "Every day, people live their lives with no thought of God. They go through their days thinking that what they see in front of them is all there is to reality. Such a person might say, “It’s up to me to make my own way. I can do whatever I think is right.”\n\nEsau embodies this sort of godlessness. He grew up as Abraham’s grandson, a child of the promise who’d certainly heard about God’s call and miraculous leading firsthand. He was a man’s man, a skilled hunter, and a daddy’s boy—the favored son. He had everything going for him, but he forfeited it all. By selling the benefits associated with his firstborn status for a simple bowl of stew, Esau displayed contempt for God’s gifts (Genesis 25:34; Hebrews 12:16). And it didn’t stop there. Esau went further in his foolish disregard for God and His ways when he took two pagan wives; two women became burdens of grief for his parents (Genesis 26:34–35).\n\nAs Christians, we can be quick to judge folks like Esau who make up their own rules for life. But the truth is that even religious folk like us are tempted to live in godless ways. In Marilynne Robinson’s novel, Gilead, the old pastor, John Ames, laments the sort of religious person who, in his pride, works hard at defending the truth without having first experienced it. Ames says, “You can assert the existence of something… having not the slightest notion of what it is.” How often are we like that? How often do we speak up to defend the message of the cross but do so with snark or contempt for others who don’t live up to our standards?\n\nEsau moved through life without thought of God, and that resulted in foolish choices. It also led him to bitterness. When Jacob betrayed him and stole his blessing, Esau couldn’t handle the injustice, so he held a grudge (Genesis 27:41).\n\nWhen we see this part of Esau’s story, we should all take warning. Bitterness is what godlessness typically looks like in the heart of a religious person. Religious folks may not play the fool publicly, but we can certainly keep account when someone does us wrong. We might even feel justified in our grudge-holding. But bitter roots will defile us (Hebrews 12:15). When we hold a grudge, we’ve failed to acknowledge God’s goodness and providence over our lives. Even when the events of our lives don’t turn out in line with our hopes and expectations, we should trust that “for those who love God all things work together for good” (Romans 8:28). Submitting our life to God’s purpose will always be better than trying to live without Him.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy",

    "devo_summary": "To our modern ears, the story of Rebekah sounds a bit strange. The young woman meets a stranger by a well, gives the man and his camels some water, and before long she’s receiving a marriage proposal— though not from this stranger, exactly. He’s only a representative of her would-be father-in-law. But the strangest part of the story? She agrees to go with the servant and his camels to a place she’s never been and marry a man she’s never met.\n\nThis whole episode grates against much of what we believe about dating and courtship. Rebekah is given little information about Isaac—what he looks like, his personality type, his likes and dislikes. She doesn’t get to go on a series of blind dates. And she isn’t given a trial period to see if he’s a good fit for her. All she has is the servant’s word.\n\nBut that word is all that really matters. The camel-toting servant of Abraham tells Rebekah and her family that God has chosen her for Isaac. He then explains about Abraham’s charge, his own prayer on the journey, and the sign that Rebekah unwittingly gave him. It all starts smelling a lot like God’s plan. As Laban and Bethuel put it, “This is from the LORD; we have no choice in the matter” (Genesis 24:50). Only Rebekah does have a choice—to follow God’s direction or ignore it. Her father and her brother speak for her—”Rebekah is here in front of you. Take her and go, and let her be a wife for your master’s son, just as the LORD has spoken” (Genesis 24:51)—but the choice is still hers alone.\n\nIn faith, Rebekah decides to trust what she is hearing—to trust God. She leaves everything familiar behind. She follows a man she has just met to a place she’s never been, to meet another man she’s never met in order to become his bride. God took her faith and turned it into the story we know as the rest of the Bible. From Rebekah and Isaac came Jacob and Esau. From Jacob came the twelve tribes of Israel. And from that nation, from the line of Jacob, down through David, came Jesus, the Savior of the world.\n\nYou and I have much in common with Rebekah. If you’re a follower of Christ, then at some point someone gave you a message that demanded a response. That message was the gospel, and it required you to leave behind all that was familiar in order to commit yourself to a Man that, up until that point, you’d never met. But the God of Rebekah’s story is the God of ours as well. It is never a mistake to trust His Word. As we read the radical commands of Jesus in the Gospels, let us remember His words can be trusted.

    "devo_summary": "Parents often have to do the impossible. I’ve had to hold my daughter down, along with two other nurses, while another nurse gave her a shot in the leg, as tears rolled down her cheeks. We’ve all had to do difficult tasks because we knew they needed to be done.\n\nI can’t imagine what Abraham did. Can you? We read about it, sure; we can visualize it as our eyes zip past the words. But can you imagine being Abraham, putting your own son on the altar, and having a conversation with him in the middle of it all? How could Abraham go through with this?\n\nAbraham’s trust in God, at least here in Genesis 22, is the high watermark in his walk with God. He obeyed in the midst of confusion. He gathered every branch needed for the fire, bundled them tight, and placed them on his son’s back. He remembered to grab his knife. Every footprint Abraham left on that mountain was evidence of his faith in God, because he knew God’s promise to bless the nations through Isaac would stand, and he believed “God [was able] to raise someone from the dead” (Hebrews 11:19).\n\nAbraham knew God would provide (Genesis 22:8). Either an animal would be found at just the right moment or God would raise Isaac from the dead. And just at the right time, a substitute was provided for Isaac. God came through. Period.\n\nBrothers, do you believe that today? Whatever you are going through, whatever you have been through, or whatever is heading your way—God will provide. As the risen Lord Jesus told our brother Paul, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is perfected in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\nHere’s why His grace is sufficient for you: At the right time, Jesus was offered up for you. Jesus bore the weight of humanity’s sin—He did it for you and for me. The Lord provided. And His power is what we need in our weakness. It is resurrection power, and it can breathe life into what was once dead. God provides, always, and His timing is always right.\n\nWritten by J.A. Medders",

    "devo_summary": "Sarai’s womb was barren, and she was desperate for children. In her culture, she had been raised to understand that it was her honor and purpose to give her husband an heir, a son. But she couldn’t. For thirty years she had lived the life of a nomad’s wife because her husband believed the Lord was going to give them a son, and that through Him all the nations of the earth would be blessed.\n\nBut there was nothing Sarai could do about it. Nothing. The covenant God had made with her husband would require a miracle birth. For her to be able to give Abram a son, God would have to resurrect her womb from the dead. And that sort of thing simply didn’t happen.\n\nShe knew her barrenness wasn’t her burden alone. Her husband bore it too. So with all this talk of an heir and with her inability to deliver one, she came up with an idea: What about Hagar, the maidservant? Perhaps she could bear a child.\n\nSarai went to her husband and said, “Since the Lord has prevented me from bearing children, go to my slave; perhaps through her I can build a family” (Genesis 16:2). In what must have seemed like far too little time, Abram agreed to this, and Hagar bore him a son, Ishmael. Sarai got what she said she wanted, and she hated what she got (vv.3–6).\n\nBut Ishmael was not the son the Lord was talking about. Sarai was as much a part of God’s covenant as Abram was. God renamed the couple—Abram became Abraham, “the father of many nations,” and Sarai became Sarah, “princess.” These new names were appropriate, for the Lord intended to bless the earth through a child Sarah would bear for Abraham. She was to be the mother of the promise.\n\nI cannot imagine how frustrating this must have been, given her barrenness. So, when she heard the Lord say, “I will certainly come back to you in about a year’s time, and your wife Sarah will have a son!” she laughed (18:9–12).\n\nIt wasn’t just that her childbearing years were behind her. It was that they had never happened, and everything she tried to do to improve her situation only complicated her life. This shell of an old woman with this wisp of a husband were now going to succeed at what they had failed to do for so many years? And by this time next year? Really?\n\nThe Lord heard her laugh from outside the tent. He asked Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh?”\n\nSarah lied, “I did not laugh.”\n\nBut the Lord said, “No, you did laugh” (vv.13–15). And He knew why. Her laugh was the laugh of turning away. She had reached her end. Surely God understood this.\n\nBut with His rebuke, He turned her back to face Him. The Lord would not permit Sarah to separate her heart from Him (Romans 8:38–39). The One who had read her mind could also open her womb.\n\nOne year later, Sarah laughed again (Genesis 21:6), perhaps as she crawled out of bed to feed her hungry, crying, rosy-cheeked baby boy. She named him Isaac, which means “laughter,” saying, “God has made me laugh, and everyone who hears will laugh with me” (Genesis 21:6–7).\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

    "devo_summary": "One of the life-truths that all of us learn in some way or another is that the pain inflicted by others can be debilitating. If you have ever been treated harshly by other people, you know exactly what I mean. The heartbreak can be devastating and even tempt us to despair.\n\nNot too long ago, I was sitting with a friend as he recounted the story of being slandered by those he’d considered trusted friends. I’ve been there too. When the situation doesn’t resolve quickly enough for us, we can be tempted to wonder if God sees our pain or hears our prayers. It’s easy to revel in our pain and lose perspective.\n\nThankfully, the God of the Bible is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8). Genesis 16 is a good reminder of His providential care. You will remember when Sarai became impatient for God’s promised heir, she decided to take matters into her own hands by changing Hagar from a maidservant to a wife to her own husband, Abram.\n\nHowever, when Abram and Hagar bore a son, tension in their household heightened. Hagar’s ability to provide Abram a son caused Sarai to look down on her and treat her harshly. Understandably, Hagar fled from Sarai.\n\nIn the midst of this turmoil, we are reminded of God’s tender love and care for those who are afflicted. The angel of the Lord encouraged Hagar to return to Abram and Sarai, and even offered her the promise that her descendants would be numerous. It is no coincidence that God named Hagar’s son Ishmael, which means “God hears.” In response to God’s kindness, Hagar “named the Lord who spoke to her: ‘You are El-roi,’ for she said, ‘In this place, have I actually seen the one who sees me?’” God looked after Hagar, just as He does with us, even when we run.\n\nAs I reflect on the story, fleeing from the situation seems like an understandable response; it is difficult to imagine a servant confronting her master. However, we are also reminded by the apostle Paul that we are not to avenge ourselves, but to overcome evil with good (Romans 12:19–21). The foundational belief behind this courageous command is that God sees our situation and knows our anguish. God hears us. God looks after us.\n\nWhen we want to run from painful situations, we need to remember that God comforts, not by changing the circumstances of our lives, but by changing us through them, and eventually, perhaps even our attitude toward them.\n\nWhen you are struggling with hardship at the hands of others, remember that God has not abandoned you, but is with you. One day you will look back on your situation and have a powerful reminder that the living God sees you—just as He saw Hagar. Let your perspective stretch beyond your current pain. Remember God’s past mercies, and remember that they are new today and every morning.\n\nWritten by Matt Capps",

    "devo_summary": "When my wife, Laurin, was just ten years old, she was part of a local summer swim league. The league had more of a summer-camp vibe than a competitive atmosphere, but Laurin is, and always has been, competitive (read: Don’t ever play Monopoly with her). She swam her heart out that summer and won races—lots of them. She was so good in the pool that her strokes caught the attention of the team’s coach. He asked Laurin if she’d like to be a part of a different kind of swim team, one that was year-round and much more competitive.\n\nThe only thing was, that team didn’t exist yet. This coach wanted to start a new team, with Laurin as his first athlete in training. That’s how the Marietta Marlins were born. Laurin became a Marlin and went on to swim competitively through high school, winning lots and lots of ribbons and trophies. She even qualified for Olympic trials one year.\n\nThat little swim team has grown over the years to become one of the premier leagues in the state. Lots of great swimmers have followed in Laurin’s wake, reaching new milestones every year. In fact, one of the Marlins’ current members is poised to make his Olympic debut in the 2020 Tokyo games.\n\nWe have no record of Abraham ever swimming a single stroke, but he was called to be the first member of something new God was doing. After the events surrounding the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11, when God scattered the nations across the known world, the Lord turned his attention to a nobody living in the backwater of Mesopotamia. God called Abraham to follow Him to a land He had never seen before. He promised to make Him into a great nation, to bless Him with descendants, land, and prosperity.\n\nAbraham isn’t remembered today for what he brought to the table. There was no special charisma or talent that caught God’s eye. He wasn’t winning the Bronze-Age equivalent of summer swim meets. Reading through Genesis with a careful eye reveals Abraham’s many mistakes (like the two—yes, two—times he nearly traded his wife, Sarah, to a foreign king in exchange for political favor [12:10–20; 20:1–18]). What makes Abraham worth remembering is his trust in God.\n\n“Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.” (Genesis 15:6). But the facts on the ground didn’t line up with God’s promises: Sarah was barren and beyond childbearing age, and the land of Canaan was in the possession of other nations, none of which appeared to be packing up and moving out anytime soon. But that’s what faith is all about—taking God at His word.\n\nWhen Abraham died, the only land in Canaan he owned was the small cave where he had buried Sarah (Genesis 23:20). And the only members of the “great nation” he had been promised were his son Isaac, Isaac’s wife, Rebekah, and his grandson Jacob. Abraham died in faith, still trusting that God would deliver on His promises. The author of Hebrews tells us that “although [he] had not received the things that were promised… [he] saw them from a distance” (Hebrews 11:13). What Abraham found as he waited in faith, though, was something far superior to land or descendants—he found a relationship with the living God. That’s the real blessing of faith.\n\nAs He did with Abraham, God has given us promises that must be taken on faith. Our new home is yet unseen, and our inheritance awaits us in heaven (1 Peter 1:4). But like Abraham, we have the privilege of walking with God right here and right now. And because of Jesus, Abraham is our father. We have been grafted into his family tree and are numbered among the many descendants he was promised.\n\nWritten by John Greco",

    "devo_summary": "What does believing in something invisible or impossible really look like? If you can’t see it or envision what it could be, how does “believing in it” actually demonstrate itself in your life?\n\nFrom time to time I like to “enliven” my son’s understanding of history by throwing in what I call “false facts,” to spice up the lessons. While I get a chuckle out of it, I’ve learned that it can be a bit of a problem for my son if I don’t make the line between make-believe and reality very clear. Case in point was the time my son announced that after Captain Cook sailed the Pacific Ocean, he took his fortune and invested in the business endeavors of his brother, one “Captain Crunch,” thus helping him to become one of the greatest cereal moguls of all time. The point is that my son actually believed my fable and was so confident in it, he repeated it and shared it with others. His belief translated into action.\n\nWhen we talk about trusting God, we can often come up against the same challenge. How does a man actually show that his “belief” has real bearing on the whole of his life, not merely his mind? The powerful life of Noah gives us the answer that shows a belief, or faith, that goes beyond mental agreement, displaying itself in every arena of life. Noah’s belief in God’s word to Him poured out of his life into confident action.\n\nWhen we find Noah in the Bible, just a few chapters into Genesis, we discover the comprehensive wickedness of the entire world. Everyone, everywhere, was corrupt. And then God speaks. The word of God declares a promise and a command for Noah to believe and obey (Genesis 6:11–18). How do we know that Noah really believes this word from God is true? It’s written all over his life. Trust in God shows itself in obedient action.\n\n“Rain will come and flood the earth, so build an ark with these specific blueprints.” Noah does it.\n\n“Go into the ark, you and your entire household, and all the animals I have commanded.” Noah does it.\n\n“Go out from the ark with all the animals and your entire family.” Noah does it.\n\nThe repetitive cycle is here shows us what faith really looks like. Belief is more than just mental agreement with a statement. True faith displays itself in the follow-through of obedience.\n\nThe contrast between Noah and the people of his day is staggering. Where the world raged in chaos and disobedience against the Lord, Noah stood firm with his trust in God. It was said that “Noah was a righteous man, blameless among his contemporaries; Noah walked with God” (Genesis 6:9).\n\nThe story of Noah shows us what a man of faith in action really looks like. It’s worth asking ourselves, What does faith in action look like in my life? How can I demonstrate my trust in God?\n\nNoah walked with God. May it be so with us.\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol",

    "devo_summary": "There was a time, early in his musical career, when singer-songwriter John Mayer claimed, “James Taylor is the template.” Anyone with ears to hear can understand that, as the songs that made Mayer popular were all built on earnest crooning and guitar strumming—first think “Fire and Rain” (by Taylor), and then compare it to “Daughters” (by Mayer). Mayer has since changed his tune, so to speak, focusing on a more funk-soul-blues-oriented approach to his music. But way back when, in the beginning, when everything got started, the template was different.\n\nSo God created man in his own image; he created him in the image of God;\n\nhe created them male and female (Genesis 1:27).\n\nThe first few chapters in Genesis reveal the template, if you will, for everything. And that includes humanity. When God set about to create male and female, God used Himself as the template, or image. Truth is, there are truckloads of ideas and opinions as to what “in God’s image” means. Some of these are solid, and some are rather thin ice. But if you stick with the text and pay attention to the words that are used around Adam and Eve’s beginnings, the word “create,” or variations on that theme (e.g., naming and tending), is like a bell that just keeps ringing. To be made in God’s image is to join Him in the ongoing work of creation, bringing that which is “good” into this world.\n\nHave we changed our tune, so to speak, since then? Anyone with eyes to see would have to agree that we’ve strayed a little, if not a lot, from that original design. Adam and Eve disobeyed God’s voice, and that led to an un-creation of the original relationship God established with the first man and woman. Their decision and subsequent actions, what the Bible calls “sin,” unraveled something that was very good. The results were far-reaching, all in some way associated with pain—whether bearing a child, or working the ground, or remembering how good it was way back when, in the beginning.\n\nBut while we, sadly and often, break from that original image or design, God does not. He stays true to Himself, to His image. God’s template does not change. So even when we un-create things by way of sin, God is constantly at work re-creating, work Scripture elsewhere refers to as redeeming, and that’s good. Actually, that’s very good.\n\nAdam and Eve’s story, while being full of disappointments, is also brimming with that re-creating, redemptive creative work. God made clothing out of animal skins for the first man and woman, effectively preparing them for what was ahead. God did not abandon them. He “clothed” them, covering their shame and guilt, and took care of them, as He does us. This act, and every other work of redemption from God’s hand, points to Christ, who breaks the curse of sin and death, covers us with His own righteousness rather than animal skins, and makes a way for us to return to paradise with God. In doing so, He bears the image of God perfectly and invites us to follow Him so that we, too, might bring more of what reflects Him—more of what is “good”—into this world.\n\nWritten by John Blase",

But when we are left dangling at the end of a season, I want to call my congressman. And don’t even get me started on a resolution-less movie. \n\nWe need closure. We need the closing notes of “shave and a haircut.” We want to hear the “two bits.” Conclusions help us understand the point of it all. Today, at the end of Romans, Paul gives us the resounding note for the letter to the Romans—a doxology of praise: “To Him be glory forever!” (Romans 16:27).\n\nEverything and everyone exists for the glory of God. Our churches, our ministries, our jobs, our entire lives are given to us for the glory of the triune God. Do you live this way, submitted to His Word and eagerly living for the fame of His name? What does that even mean? What is God’s glory? God’s glory is the “Godness” of God going public—it is what we see of Him that moves us to worship.\n\nHow do the heavens declare the glory of God? They display things like wonder and majesty. By faith, we see the creative power and brilliance of God as clouds wisp across our patch of sky, gliding to other coordinates on this blue marble dangling in the cosmos. God displays His glory all around us. We are meant to look for it—to see it, to align with it, to spread it.\n\nThe gospel teaches us that we are not the point of our own lives—God is. He saved us for our good and His glory. Living for the glory of God means we agree with who God says He is, and we align our lives accordingly. We submit and serve. We enjoy and exalt. \n\nJesus’ death for our sins and His resurrection for our new life enables and empowers us to behold the glory and fame of God, and to worship Him for it. “Your sins are forgiven for his name’s sake” (1 John 2:12 ESV). We, the forgiven ones, rejoice at God’s glory because we reap the blessings of it.\n\nThe glory of God lasts forever. It isn’t trendy. Nothing will outdo the awesomeness of God. Don’t live in cliffhanger-mode, wondering what your life is all about. Jesus redirects our lives to His—one forever aligned to the glory of God. “Not to us, Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory because of your faithful love, because of your truth” (Psalm 115: CSB).\n\nWritten by J.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nThe writer Mark Spragg grew up around horses. In fact, he called himself a “horseboy.” In his memoir, Where Rivers Change Direction, he tells of how he and his father trained their horses to “show them their heads”—in other words, to pay attention or be expectant when they were around. Spragg tells of how he could walk into another man’s corral and know the man—by the way his horses lounged—to be a horse’s, well, rear.\n\nI grew up around churches and the preachers who led those churches. I was a preacher’s boy. At the risk of oversimplification, I found two kinds of preachers: those who would greet all the people before a service began, and those who would be sequestered away somewhere in an office, putting the final touches on a sermon or praying or whatever. I could walk into other men’s churches and know the man—by the way the congregation didn’t expect to be greeted by him—to possibly be a fine speaker who could untie theological knots, but not much of a friend.\n\nThe primary text for today emphasizes how important valuing one another is. We make much about the “last things” Jesus said, and so give great importance to the Great Commission at the conclusion of Matthew’s Gospel. If we’re going to be consistent, we must give equal importance to how Paul concludes the weighty letter known as Romans: “Greet one another” (Romans 16:16). \n\nThis is not some drive-by where you wave at the crowd and use words like “Hey, everybody” or “Bye, y’all.” No, this is personal. People are known by name (Phoebe, Rufus) and also by some details about them—“who risked their own necks for my life” or “my dear friend in the Lord.”\n\nDo you greet people by their names instead of “Hey”? Do you know details about the people you come in contact with every day? Do you know anything about their story—not everything, but at least a few things? I realize some men are naturally outgoing while other men are quiet, even shy. I’ve found that has little to do with being a man who greets well.\n\nYou can tell a lot about a man by walking into his places of influence, and watching to see if the people raise their heads and eyes, expecting to receive the gift of a greeting. \n\nIn the name of Jesus and for the sake of His gospel, greet one another.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n",

In any case, the ending is most often the lasting impression of the work.\n\nPaul’s letter to the Romans is indeed a letter—it’s written as instruction and encouragement to its recipients. It has a greeting and a conclusion, and the meat of the letter is Paul’s teaching on various related subjects that the church in Rome was struggling with. Nonetheless, Paul is still telling a story with his letter.\n\nAs we have traced through this letter, we’ve seen the argument Paul has built: we’re all sinners deserving of death, but we are saved by grace through faith and God calls us to live in light of this fact. The death that sin brings is just as real as the life Jesus brings—but that life has swallowed up death. We can place our hope in this. This is our peace.\n\nAs Paul concludes the letter, he seems to tie a bow on the whole story. He’s not just saying goodbye to some friends; he’s leaving them with an ending to the story. He’s putting a final touch on the picture of God’s glory that he’s just painted.\n\nPaul thanks the church for their kindness, but he makes a greater point: the mission is bigger than just them (Romans 15:26-28). The blessings of Christ—this gospel Paul and all of us have been called to preach—is a worldwide mission. Paul needs to take the encouragement and support of the gospel to both the Jews and the Gentiles. The good news of the gospel, the blessing of Christ, is meant to reach every corner of the world (Matthew 28:18-20). So Paul concludes his letter by asking the Romans to pray for him, and to pray for the Spirit’s work in the world.\n\nDon’t overlook this conclusion. It is not an add-on to an otherwise majestic theological book. It is a theological statement about how the gospel is meant to move and work. The gospel is meant to come to us, and flow through us to others. This is what Paul wants for himself and for all believers. \n\nLet’s heed Paul’s request to the Romans and pray for the blessing of Christ to infiltrate the hearts of people all over the world.\n\nWritten by Brandon D.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWe are prone to look at success, both worldly and spiritual, as merit, rather than grace. Whenever I think I have grown spiritually, I am tempted to pat myself on the back and feel smug. My heart can take a generous compliment and turn it into entitlement in no time at all. But genuine spiritual growth doesn’t turn our eyes self-ward, nor does it set us on a pedestal to receive honor. Instead, spiritual maturity is manifested in humility and service. This is so because all of life is doxological; it is aimed at one thing: the praise of God.\n\nPaul opens this passage with a clear instruction that grows directly out of this doxological aim: strength, authority, power, and influence are not for self-gain or personal honor. In a culture of self-worship, this is a radical notion. But this radical idea is a hallmark of Christianity, for Christ did not please Himself. He exchanged glory for lowliness, power for humility, and even life for death. This is not just about earthly gains, wealth, and blessing, but about spiritual strength. \n\nFor those who follow Christ, Paul says, the life of service to others is not an option but an obligation, for Christ became a servant. Closeness to Christ leads to the building up of the saints in harmony. It produces the fruit of love and service, not of self-serving pride.\n\nFor this reason, Paul declares, “I would not dare say anything except what Christ has accomplished through me” (Romans 15:18). How easy it might have been for Paul to claim honors for himself for the success of his ministry! But Paul’s great legacy as an apostle to the Gentiles came about because of the grace given him by God. The root and the fruit of the Christian life are all of grace, so that no man may boast except in the work of Christ. Therefore, where grace is at work, gratefulness, service, encouragement and harmony results. \n\nChrist’s glorious humility brought salvation to Jew and Gentile alike, that all nations might bring Him praise. For great is His steadfast love toward us, and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever. \n\nWhen we see the glories of the gospel, delivered to an undeserving and needy people, our tongues are set free to echo God’s praises. May the God of hope fill us with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit we may abound in hope, to the praise of His glory.\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nRemember when you first got your driver’s license? All that freedom, all that road, all that speed. You could go anywhere and do anything—except break curfew or give rides to other teens or to girls or speed or run red lights or take long road trips. Freedom has its limits, at least it ought to, especially to protect the less mature.\n\nIn Romans 14 we see a scenario in which freedom and limits are again in tension. Now that the Old Testament laws of cleanliness and purification were in the past, it meant that any food or drink was pure, so people were digging in. But this caused issues for other believers still more closely connected to the old ways. Their consciences were pricked by this new freedom—it felt wrong to eat or drink these new things, or even be in proximity to them.\n\nSo on one side we have people exercising their freedom in Christ. On the other side we have people abiding by their consciences. Both good things, but in tension.\n\nPaul brings the tension back to the heart. He points out that food and drink are not the issue. The issue is love. People on one side were prioritizing their freedom above the hearts of fellow believers and causing them to struggle. He points out that, clean or not, if food or drink is seen as questionable by someone, then for that person to consume it would be sin. The liberated person should set aside their freedom temporarily in order to show love.\n\nThe church is a body and a family. When one part works in conflict with another, it breaks down. One person’s freedom in Christ cannot be a license to push another person into conflict with their conscience. All actions, attitudes, and convictions in the church must be done and held in such a way as to build up and support. They must pursue love. \n\nThe self-sacrifice of setting aside liberties is an indication of spiritual maturity. It shows that love for brothers and sisters is of greater value than one’s own freedom or pleasure.\n\nBelievers are no longer under the old law, but neither can we grab our freedoms and revel in them for our own happiness at the expense of others. We are free because of God’s profound love and grace through Jesus, so love and grace and Christlikeness must be the marks of our freedom. \n\nSometimes we will revel and eat or drink to our great pleasure. Other times we will sacrifice our freedoms for the sake of our brothers and sisters who have yet to discover the guilt-free freedom of Jesus. This is true maturity proven by love.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nA Christian is to honor God with all the decisions he makes. This means our decisions—what to wear, eat, watch, etcetera—should not be first and foremost about what we like or want, but about what God likes or wants. In whatever we do, “we live to the Lord” (Romans 14:8; 1 Corinthians 10:31).\n\nSimply put, personal preference cannot be the ultimate arbiter of our decisions. We may like how certain clothes look or feel, and that’s good; but the first question we must ask is, “Will this honor God?” We may like certain foods for their nutrition or taste, but the primary consideration is, “Will this be pleasing to the Lord?”\n\nNow, I have good news for you: God is pleased with a LOT of different clothes and foods. From togas to t-shirts, He gives us great liberty. The same is true of food. You can go for the green smoothie or hit up Five Guys for a juicy hamburger. Both are well within the scope of God’s pleasure.\n\nOf course, as you make these decisions, principles of modesty, stewardship, freedom, and wisdom are in play. Paul reminds us elsewhere that, though something may be permissible, it is not always profitable (1 Corinthians 10:23). You have things to think about when you pick out that garment or order from that menu. Your life is not your own (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). In all our decisions, we must honor God and love those around us.\n\nBut remember, it’s a problem if we begin to judge others by our own particular convictions and choices when the Lord has given them freedom. Or worse, when we demand that others conform to our convictions when Scripture demands we extend liberty.\n\nLet me go back to the food illustration. Maybe today you’re munching on carrots and celery for lunch out of a commitment to be a good steward your physical body (Matthew 25:14-30), while your fellow Christian coworker across the table downs a cheeseburger as an expression of freedom and a celebration of the cleanliness of all foods (Acts 9:10-16). Which one of you is right? Don’t answer—it’s a trick question. You both have a biblical basis for the particular choices you’ve made, and you can both honor the Lord in the decisions you’ve made. What’s essential is that you are “fully convinced in your own mind” (Romans 14:5) and that you open-heartedly welcome the other’s convictions as well (Romans 14:1-3).\n\nWe live this way because God has already “welcomed” both carrot and burger eaters into the kingdom of Jesus Christ. It is only through grace, not perfect decision-making, that we will be able to stand at the end of time (Romans 14:4). And so we follow St. Augustine’s old dictum, “Love God and do what you will.”\n\nWhen Jesus is the true unifying point of community life, wine connoisseurs sit down with teetotalers and there’s not a hint of judgment. Meat eaters break bread with vegetarians, and neither looks down their nose at the other. \n\nWhen we’ve truly tight-gripped the gospel, we gain the liberty to hold many other things loosely, or freely. And that’s just how God would have it. \n\nWritten by Nate Shurden\n\n",

You know that feeling, the one where you look at the clock on your bedside table and you realize you’re already a half-hour late to that crucial meeting or final exam? Panic sets in, and your entire day feels completely thrown off.\n\nDid you know that it’s possible to be spiritually asleep? Elsewhere in his letters, Paul seems to use this language to describe those who are either physically or spiritually dead, but here in Romans 13 he seems to be addressing believers (“…nearer now than when we first believed.”). Paul is worried that his readers are going to miss key encounters with the Spirit and power of God because of their spiritual complacency. This concern, of course, extends to us too.\n\nPaul cautions the church in Rome because he can see a cycle forming. Spiritual complacency and sleepiness is not a singular issue, but rather one that ripples outward. When you atrophy spiritually, it affects many of your decisions, which in turn further diminishes your spiritual strength. The cycle Paul is worried about in Romans 13 looks something like this: Spiritual apathy leads to compromising sin choices. These behaviors lead to a more spiritually numb life, which leads to more bad choices, and so goes the cycle.\n\nPerhaps you’ve felt yourself stuck in a pattern like this. It can feel like being trapped on a treadmill where you have no control over the speed. Thankfully, Paul calls us all to a different, more fruitful way of living. “Rather, put on the Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 13:14 ESV). Another translation reads, “clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ” (NIV). \n\nBreaking the cycle of spiritual sleep and unhealthy choices starts with a change in our understanding of who we are. We are meant to see ourselves under, in, and through the life and work of Jesus Christ and His calling over us. With this shift of our internal compass and posture, we are able to combat the cycle of spiritual sleep and distance from God.\n\nIf you’re reading this and feel like you’ve overslept, the good news is that it’s never too late to break your cycle or get back on track. You are a new creation and can be “clothed with the Lord.” In that place of spiritual redemption, you can choose this day “to put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light” (Romans 13:12). One of the thieves on the cross next to Jesus found this to be true in his final moments. It is never too late to make Jesus the fullness of your identity. \n\nTake that step today.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n“Detest evil; cling to what is good” (Romans 12:9).\n\nThis makes me think of two scenes from two of my favorites books.\n\nScene 1: In Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, there is a scene where Darcy is relating the sordid lifestyle of Wickham so as to dispel a rumor that Wickham is a valiant man who has been wronged by Darcy. The opposite is actually true. In fact, Darcy had been generous to a fault with Wickham, and Wickham chose a prodigal lifestyle without ever returning gratitude. In the movie, as he is telling the story, there is a scene of him walking in on Wickham, who is with a woman. And the look on Darcy’s face is one of barely being able to look at what’s happening in front of him because of how evil it is.\n\nScene 2: There is a scene in The Road by Cormac McCarthy when the son asks the father if they are still the good guys. The father had done something to protect them, and the son was unsure if they were still on the side of good. I’ve read this book now at least five times. Each time I am moved by this scene. In McCarthy’s nightmare, where so much evil is surrounding them and demanding things from them, this young boy is concerned about him and his father being the good guys.\n\nI think those two scenes sum up pretty well what Paul is wanting from the Roman Christians and from us in today’s passage. Paul wants us to regard evil as though it is hard to look upon, not because we are judging people and looking down on them in their sin, but because we know the harm evil does. \n\nThis is reason Christ died: to defeat evil once and for all. We are called to detest evil—like Darcy.\n\nPaul wants us also to cling to what is good—the way McCarthy’s boy clung to a desire to be good in the midst of a world where the darkness of evil and suffering and hurt had descended like an ever-present fog. In that scene, McCarthy’s apocalyptic world is not so different from the one we know at present. We’re called to cling to what is good.\n\nWhere do we get help to live out Romans 12:9? At the foot of the most evil act that did the most good: the Cross. The focal point of the gospel is the ultimate act of evil, and God’s ultimate act of detesting it and doing the ultimate good.\n\nThere, at the cross, sin was defeated. Above every event that ever was, this one is good beyond all human measurement. When we need help detesting evil and clinging to what is good, we can cling to the cross and hold fast.\n\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhat does it mean to be a living sacrifice? Consider a couple of everyday examples: marriage and parenthood.\n\nMarriage and parenthood are two of the most significant relationships people have in life. They are also two of the most demanding. Both ask for sacrifices not fully known before the “big day.” How many times have you talked with engaged couples or expectant parents and listened as they painted a glorious picture of what they thought their upcoming life would look like? And if you are already down those roads a bit, how many times have you heard this and thought, They just can’t see how many surprises await. \n\nIf you have traveled the road of marriage or parenthood for any significant distance, you know what’s involved. You know the coordination, the patience, and the sacrifice required. I remember a few years ago when talking with an engaged couple. The husband-to-be said, “You married people are sometimes the worst advertisements for marriage.” Surprised, I asked what he meant. He said married people often seem to take it upon themselves to warn young engaged couples about how hard marriage is. \n\nOf course, some of the “advice” is terrible, like: “Are you sure you really want to give your life to serve someone else?” “You really don’t know what you are signing up for.” “There goes your freedom.”\n\nMarriage is a sacrifice. No one argues that point. Sadly, those who make comments like these don’t seem to get the joy of living as a sacrifice. Laying down your life for another is a learned joy; it comes from humility, from valuing the other more than yourself.\n\nMarriage and parenthood are challenging. They are examples of the biblical call for self-sacrifice. But sacrifice is a beautiful challenge. When we sacrifice for the right things, we are shaped into a humble people, and joy is the result.\n\nIn our Scripture today, God calls us to be a living sacrifices (Romans 12:1). This is a beautiful thing—living while sacrificing. Just like the engaged couple that is unaware of the joyful sacrifices ahead of them, the Christ follower is also blissfully unaware of the joy that awaits him when he learns to function as a living sacrifice.\n\nFollowing Jesus costs us everything, but it gives us everything we really need, too. Consider what it means to present your bodies as living sacrifices, and take courage in the beautiful challenge of resting in Christ in deeper ways than you ever thought possible.\n\nWritten by Jason Tippetts\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nA couple months ago, I was talking with my mom about how we do allowances for our kids. I said to her, “Remember how you used to do it when I was a kid? You’d put all those little sticky notes on the fridge with chores and dollar values on them, and we’d take them off and put them in a pile as we did them?” \n\nMom said, “Oh, we tried all kinds of things.” \n\n“Really? That’s all I remember,” I said, surprised. \n\n“I think we tried that method out for a few weeks, but that’s it.”\n\nIt’s funny how we remember the passage of time, isn’t it? There are things I did as a kid for only a few weeks which I remember as having done for years on end. Now a parent myself, I try all sorts of things with my own kids that might only last a week or two, but I bet when they’re grown they’ll have memories of some of those things and think we did them all the time.\n\nHere’s my point: the older get we, the more trouble we have remembering how things actually happened. We compress timelines. We think we did certain things all the time when we actually didn’t. And some things we did do all the time, we may have forgotten entirely. We can begin to lose our hold on the foundational truths of what really happened. \n\nThis is not so with God.\n\nIn today’s passage from Romans, Paul reminds his readers that God has been at work among His people for a long, long time. The Christian faith is undergirded with realities that have stood since before we were born and will remain long after we’re gone. \n\nGod has given gifts and issued calls to His people that we are likely to forget. Paul’s point is this: Whether we remember them or not, God’s gifts and callings stand. Our memory of them, or lack thereof, does not erase them.\n\nGod’s gifts are what He gives us, the His calling is where He leads us. In our passage, Paul is referring to the gifts God gave Israel (listed in Romans 9:4 as “the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple service, and the promises”) and their calling, which is the promise of salvation. These, Paul says, are irrevocable.\n\nAs with Israel, God gives us both an eternal calling to the life to come, as well as gifts to use in this life here and now. We cannot “forget” them away. Passages like Romans 11:25-36 remind us that God has been at work since the beginning of time. God knows our hard-heartedness and sin better than we remember it, and He gives us a mercy greater than we suspect we need.\n\nAdmit that your memory, when it comes to sin and grace, can sometimes get a little fuzzy. And when you do, rest in the fact that God’s promises do not hinge on our ability to remember them. He remembers them perfectly, and they are irrevocable.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

In a real way, yes they did. They were a part of the experience. There was a bond between the team and its fans, which facilitated a shared moment of joy.\n\nBut imagine a fan bragging about his victory more than the team’s MVP does. Picture him filled with pride, talking himself up, discounting Tom Brady’s feats in the Super Bowl, or LeBron James’s guts in the NBA Finals. It seems a bit ridiculous, doesn’t it?\n\nAs crazy as it seems to think that we not only help our teams win, but deserve the trophy too—how insane is it for us overlook God’s grace when we think about our own standing in this life? \n\nThe Lord’s offer to save sinners through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is a total act of God. Our efforts bring nothing to His saving grace. We can’t muscle our way into the New Covenant. God’s kindness is at work in our salvation. He sustains us. This is what we celebrate. His victory is our victory.\n\nAs men, we are often tempted to compare ourselves to others, seeking a little ego boost to make ourselves feel better. We wrongly think we are more worthy of salvation than others. We may even believe God saved us because of all the great things we offer to His cause. But salvation is about a God who is rich in mercy, even when we were dead in our sins. \n\nPaul reminds us that apples don’t keep the apple tree going. The fruit doesn’t sustain the root. It works the other way around. There is no place for pride in the Christian life. We boast, not in ourselves, but in the cross—in Christ’s death for our sins (Galatians 6:14).\n\nWhenever we are tempted to crank up our self-importance, we must remember that God’s kindness is what justifies our entire lives. Knowing the gospel, reading and enjoying the Bible, serving in the Lord’s name—these are all launched and sustained by His kindness. God gets the credit. He saved you. He is saving you. He will save you. \n\nEnjoy and exult in God’s kindness. Rely on His strength. It’s the only way to live.\n\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n",

I’m suspicious of everything that bangs my eardrums. \n\nDiscerning fact from fiction in this digital age is now a full-time but necessary job. The whole intent behind fake news is the spread of misinformation, hoaxes, bogus stories, or whatever you want to call them. It’s not that this is some new phenomenon, but that the reality of social media brings an ease of spreading the stuff like never before.\n\nPreachers and teachers and writers and communicators of the gospel find themselves in this cultural moment. But all of us as people of faith do too, in a very real sense, for we all have a platform nowadays. And into this fact-checking mentality and culture we bring Scripture, which is filled with strange stories of people being made from dust and ribs, and axe heads that float on the surface of the water. Then there’s that virgin birth that eventually led to a man who claimed to be God but then died but then decided we were all better off with Him alive, so He un-died and is still around today. \n\nIn the minds of some, Christians are the original fake-newsers. Who in their fact-checking mind would believe our message? And what are we supposed to do about it?  To borrow a line from some actual news of late: Nevertheless, we must persist. But as we persist, we must be diligent to not fall into the spreading of what some call the larger category that includes fake news: bad news. \n\nThe good news is that if we’ll simply stop trying so hard to save ourselves, we’ll find that there is One who has already taken care of all that and then some. His name is Jesus, and His ears are poised and ready to respond to all who would call on Him—Jew or Greek, free or slave, American or Arabic, doctor or school bus driver, grandparent or hipster.\n\n“For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Romans 10:13).\n\nWhen we fact-check that verse, we find that the phrase “everyone who calls” means, well, everyone who calls. And we find that “the name of the Lord” is Jesus, that virgin-born man who claimed to be God. And that last phrase—“will be saved”—is a fact you just have to take on faith.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n",

How can a good God be wrathful toward people?\n\nThis passage in Romans 9, among many others, raises tough questions about God’s character. Good questions. Questions that God doesn’t mind you asking and that He can handle.\n\nHow can a good God be wrathful toward sin? He can because He is a good judge, and good judges rightfully hate and push back against evil. We want a God who says, “I am here to not allow injustice to reign as king. I am here to reign as King against injustice.” \n\nBecause God is perfect, His wrath isn’t like ours—it’s an outflow of His perfect love and goodness. And because of this great love, God calls us to place our faith in His righteousness and not our own.\n\nWe’re clay, created by God to worship Him. When we try to earn our salvation, we miss the point of our existence. This was Israel’s greatest mistake.\n\nIf you read through the Old Testament, you see Israel obeying and then disobeying God, worshiping Him and then worshiping idols, ultimately placing their hope in something other than God’s unmerited favor. Israel tried and tried to work for their salvation, and they even questioned God for not rewarding their efforts. But God’s not interested in our white-knuckled efforts. He’s interested in our faith driving us to love Him and others.\n\nGod is not surprised by sin, but that doesn’t mean He’s ambivalent toward it. God is not surprised by unbelief, but that doesn’t mean He’s satisfied with our misplaced worship. In fact, He cares so much that He sent His Son to live the life we couldn’t live and die the death we deserve.\n\nMay we not be bitter or angry toward God like the Israelites, questioning His character because we don’t like something He’s said or done. Instead, let us lay our lives down for Him because of His righteous, perfect character. He is good and He does good.\n\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n",

But then, in a dramatic turn of events, he picks up the gavel and, striking the bench like a hammer driving a nail, renders the verdict: “not guilty.” \n\nYou and everyone else know you are guilty of the accusations brought against you. But the judge has shown you mercy.\n\nThe reality is that every person saved by Jesus has been shown mercy like this. “Guilty” is the only verdict any of us deserve, and apart from Christ, it is the ruling rendered upon all men and women on this earth. All our wrongdoing and wrong-loving has stood trial, and the evidence against us is insurmountable.\n\nThough we do not deserve to be let off the hook, God is the only judge who can and does show mercy to anyone He desires. Some might say that pronouncing a verdict of “not guilty” upon someone who is clearly guilty is unfair, and they are correct. The unfairness of this forgiveness God grants through His mercy is called grace. Grace cannot be earned, but is a gift given by God to an otherwise hopelessly guilty people.\n\nMercy and compassion are gifts God gives for His good pleasure, but they are not free. God does not just let us off the hook. A price must be paid for our sin. God, in His compassion and mercy, gave His only Son, Jesus, to pay the penalty for our violation of His law. \n\nGod will show mercy upon whom He will show mercy. But He does not set people free without penalty. That would be unjust. He pays the wage of our sin through the blood of His Son.

    "devo_summary": "\n\n“If God loves me, He will _____.”\n\nWhat words would you use to fill in that blank? Most often when we answer this question, whether privately in our hearts or more boldly, we limit the love of God. We attach His love to the circumstances or results we want. We draw a straight line between God’s love and our comfort.\n\nRomans 8 paints an altogether different picture of a love so much bigger, richer, deeper, and more complete than anything we are even capable of imagining. It isn’t a contingent love or one designed to dole out creature comforts. It cannot be cheapened by our color-by-number effort to depict it. Romans 8 is a masterpiece of God’s love, which is intended for our good.\n\nIn Jesus we live loved. We breathe love and exist each moment ensconced in it. No one can condemn us. No one can judge us. No enemy can assail us. Yes, we will be condemned, judged, and assailed in this world, but no one can remove us from Christ’s love. Our own fears and insecurities, even our own death, cannot remove us from the love of God.\n\nThis profound love of God was ours before we were conscious of it, and will be ours for all eternity to the fullness of our joy and glorification. God promised to complete the good work He started in us (Philippians 1:6), and He will—through the transformative power of His love. \n\nWhen Romans 8:28 says “all things work together for good,” this is what it means: not that every painful or confusing moment will pay out in happiness, but that God’s love will not fail. We will reap its benefits throughout infinite time.\n\nIn this single passage we see the fullness of God—Father, Son, and Spirit—offer the fullness of His love to those who believe. The Spirit intercedes on our behalf when we lack the words or ability. The Son sacrifices Himself as the means—the access—to this rich love. The Father is the ordainer, author, and giver of the eternal plan of love. And we are part of it, in it for all time. \n\nWe may never get what we filled in the blank with above—that thing we attached to God’s love, that trite and limiting expected sign of His goodness. Instead we will be more than conquerors in eternal glory, no matter what we face in this temporal life.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nI turn 40 years old this year—the prospect of which brings several realizations. First, I’ve come to understand that time moves every bit as fast as others told me it would back when I was in my 20s; and, second, I can do just about every physical act I did in my 20—but I need more time to recover. \n\nThe strength and vigor that once marked my life is now replaced with pains and groans. This unwanted experience has served to better my appreciation for the Apostle Paul’s references to groaning in Romans 8:18-25. In that place, Paul sets the hope of glory against the backdrop of the groaning of this fallen world.\n\nWe live in a world that God has subjected to futility (Romans 8:20). Everything around us is groaning under the burden of the fall of man. The fall of Adam brought misery to the entire created order. The turmoil in the world is not simply limited to the turmoil between nations and peoples. There is an innate groaning among all creatures in the animal kingdom, too. There is even a groaning among the trees and vegetation. \n\nAll of creation is crying out for something better. \n\nThis is one reason why the prophet Isaiah speaks of the glories of the new heavens and new earth under the symbol of the lion laying down with a calf in peace (Isaiah 11:6). It’s why the psalmist speaks of the trees clapping their hands at the prospect of the Lord coming to judge the world in righteousness (Isaiah 55:12). In one very real sense, the entire creation is like a woman in labor. This old, broken creation is eagerly anticipating the new creation that Christ has secured and will deliver by His death and resurrection. \n\nThere is, however, also the groaning of the people of God who have been subjected to the sufferings of this present life. This groaning is tied to the persecution believers endure at the hands of unbelievers—both in the church and in the world. There is a tremendous burden in the sufferings believers must bear up under as they press on to the hope of glory. But there will come a day when believers will be set free, in body and soul, from the sufferings of this present age and will be ushered into the inexpressible glory of everlasting life.\n\nWhenever we hear or feel the groans of this life—whether in the created order around us or in our own hearts—we must remember that there will come a day of glory for creation in general and for believers in particular. All temporal groaning will end and eternal rejoicing will commence when Christ comes in glory to raise His people from the dust.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nOctober 31, 2017, marks the 500-year anniversary of the day Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of All Saints Church in Wittenberg, Germany. Luther’s burning conviction was to preach that salvation came to God’s people only by miraculous grace through faith in Jesus Christ. Now, there were other monks and priests at the time with similar convictions, but it seems clear that Luther’s intense study of Romans was his tipping point. In passion and in conviction, he penned and posted a document that would change the face of the Church in the West forever.\n\nLuther knew from Paul’s letter to the Romans that the Spirit of God alone could mark us as children of God. Good works, good intentions, and good gifts to the church or the poor weren’t without value, but they could never stand as being able to save anyone in and of themselves.\n\nThe very good news of Romans is the same very good news of the Gospels: God entered the world, a world that He had created perfectly and that we, through sin, had marred. God sent His Son to bring us life everlasting. This life, as Paul so clearly points out here in Romans 8, comes with and through the gift of the Spirit, Who produces spiritual fruit in our lives.\n\nJesus said to His disciples that we could be recognized by our fruits. There seems to be a very similar thread here in Romans 8. Life in the Spirit is marked by the fruits of the Spirit. Paul is not only giving a promise here, but also a quick spiritual litmus test for our own lives. When we, as believers, examine our hearts, actions, and decisions, do we see a pattern of Spirit-filled movement? Of course, we will still see sin. In fact, both Jesus and Paul acknowledge this. But it should be troublesome to us if we see a continuous pattern in our lives incongruent with the marks of the Spirit.\n\nThe good news is that if you choose to be led by the Spirit, you can have confidence in your place as a child of God. Paul proclaims: “If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you” (Romans 8:11). \n\nThere should be evidence of the Holy Spirit’s work in the Christian’s life. But as Martin Luther contended, that spiritual fruit does not come through our work. In today’s passage, Paul encourages us that we have the power of God—the same power that raised Jesus from the dead—living in us to help us produce that spiritual fruit. \n\nWhen you’ve placed all of the good, the bad, and the ugly in your life at the feet of Jesus, you have the Spirit of God as your advocate. He is the one Who testifies with our spirit that we are the children of God. \n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nMy dad was a pastor, so I was pretty familiar with the Bible growing up. Check that. My dad was a Southern Baptist pastor in the 70s and 80s, so I grew up doing sword drills and memorizing Scripture as part of the air I breathed as a kid. But it seems now there was a lot of the Bible we touched on and a lot we skipped over.\n\nLike Romans, for instance. I knew a lot of this book. I knew the “Roman Road to heaven” in high school. But there was a lot in this book I did not discover until college.\n\nTake Romans 7, for example. I can remember the first time I got ahold of Paul’s own wrestling. I can remember the “aha!” moment pretty well, actually. I remember it so well because of how it made me feel less alone in my struggle with sin. Whether it was in my own head or because I heard someone say it, I walked away with the thought, “so this is the Christian life.”\n\nThat was a pretty revolutionary moment. Up until then I’d bought into the idea that if I was a real Christian, I would not struggle with sin as Paul describes. I would always be saying no to sin and yes to righteousness. What felt like a cosmic battle between good and evil within my own heart, which often made me feel sick to my stomach, was surely a sign of how carnal I was.\n\nBut this was Paul. Paul was the man. And it was clear he struggled too.\n\nThat was a beginning a for me. I felt less alone and more free to talk about my struggles instead of pretend to have it all together. It was a slow process, but it was sure. As one who wanted to follow Jesus and be holy, I was glad to know that struggling was a sign of fighting. And fighting was a sign of following Jesus.\n\nI think we assume sin will kind of fade away from us as we grow in the faith. And that is true to a point. As Paul taught in chapter 6, we have been set free from sin (6:18). But there will be seasons when we struggle in big ways. And as we grow older and wiser, we will see our sinfulness and our need for His grace more clearly. So really, what Paul reveals to us is good news: We will struggle. But that means we are fighting. And fighting is a dead giveaway that we are believing the gospel and following Christ.\n\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nDeath takes more than it brings. It takes not just people, but relationships and dreams and future plans. Death is more of an intruder than an invited guest. It brings tears and a church gathering where awkward small talk with strangers is accompanied by deviled eggs and cucumber sandwiches.\n\nPersonally, I hate death. I hate the emotions it brings and the loss it forces me into. I hate that it even exists. I will admit that my hatred for death is a selfish hatred. To be forced to lose my people, my relationships, and my future dreams hurts.\n\nDeath, at its core, reminds me that I am not in control. This life is not about my plans. Death is a deep reminder that something is seriously wrong. It pushes us to admit that this world, in its present state, is not where we belong.\n\nSo if we don’t belong here, then where do we belong? Where is the place we can settle into without the dread of eviction? This question is ultimately not about a place, but a person: to whom do we belong? \n\nFor the Christian, we belong to Him who was raised from the dead. We belong to the One who is victorious over death. We belong to Christ.\n\nOur Scripture today reminds us that we belong to Him who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God in this life (Romans 7:4). Our lives here matter. We are called to bear fruit, to invest in those parts of life that last beyond the grave. This is comforting.\n\nThough we will all die in some sort of physical way (unless the Lord returns first), we should not dread death as though it ends everything. As the Lord assures us in Proverbs 1:33, “whoever listens to me will live securely and be undisturbed by the dread of danger.”\n\nDeath comes and we are shocked and grieved. We hurt with those who feel the loss. Some of the fruit we grow in this life because of Christ is the peace dwelling secure, without dread, because we know life is ultimately victorious over death. \n\nIn Christ, we have a security that keeps us beyond any death.  \n\nWritten by Jason Tippetts\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWe do our best to keep things open-ended. We try hard to keep all options open. We don’t RSVP to the party too early lest something better comes along. And we do all this in order to remain free.\n\nOr, so we think.\n\nSadly, this loose-ended, unattached freedom proves to be its own slavery. For in refusing to commit to relationships, we’re ensnared by loneliness. In always remaining open to the better offer, we’re trapped by anxiety. And whenever a better offer doesn’t pan out the way we hoped (and that will happen time and again), we spiral into depression. Isn’t it true that sometimes our best attempts at freedom turn into the worst kinds of captivity?\n\nIt’s actually through serving that we find freedom, and we’re all serving someone or some thing. Bob Dylan understood this, as the lyrics from his 1979 hit, “Gotta Serve Somebody,” make clear: \n\nYou’re gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed\n\nYou’re gonna have to serve somebody,\n\nWell, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord\n\nBut you’re gonna have to serve somebody.\n\nDylan is absolutely right. You’re gonna serve something. But whether it’s the devil or the Lord – well, that will make all the difference.\n\nWe learn in today’s reading that the truly free life of the Christian is not so much a freedom from slavery as it is a freedom to be bound to Someone in the right kind of way. Which makes sense if you think about it, for that is exactly how true love works.\n\nWhen we love a friend or a spouse, we willingly restrict ourselves in service to them. We spend money on them. We carve out time to be with them. We give to them our attention and affection. We do this not because we have to, but because we want to—because we love them. Our love for them leads us into a voluntary, life-giving, joy-spreading life of service. It’s the same way with Jesus Christ, “…having been set free from sin, [we] become slaves of righteousness” (Romans 6:18) in love for Jesus Christ. \n\nThe more we see and experience what Jesus has done for us – paying the penalty, breaking the power, and one day removing entirely the presence of sin – the more we can then return His love with love that willingly renders us “slaves of God” (Romans 6:22).\n\nBrothers, take in the love of Christ for you today. Let His love free you to such a degree that you willingly and joyfully enslave yourself to God and His righteousness all the days of your life.\n\nWritten by Nate Shurden\n\n",

Then more stomping. Then stomping with a dash of panic. She ran away, spooked and screaming, “Kill it, Papa! Kill it!” I gently put the eggs down, and ran over to see a mutant, Hot-Wheel-sized, furry, wingless wasp-looking thing. I stomped. It moved. I stomped two more times. The beast ran. Three more stomps. It darted and tried to lose me in the grass, but after a barrage of stomps and some heel-digs, it was all over. I killed what my friends on Facebook identified as a “velvet ant.”  \n\nVelvet ants are infamous for their bites and their toughness. Sin is, too, isn’t it? But Jesus is stronger. The temptations we face are real, no doubt. But our death to sin and new life in Christ are even more real because that life will last for 10 billion years—and more—to come.\n\nWe all have various sins that easily trap us (Hebrews 12:1). But Jesus introduces us to new life, new power, and a new way with Him on the throne. Sin’s grasp on us was formidable, but when Jesus died on the cross He crushed the velvet ant-ness of our sin. Christ conquered and killed what every other power could not. He rose from the dead, bringing us along with Him toward a life of grace, forgiveness, and freedom from sin (Galatians 5:1).\n\nOur freedom from sin’s chains is as real as Christ’s cross and His empty tomb. A no-longer-dead Jesus means a no-longer-doomed-to-sin you and me. Let’s not throw our hands up in despair, overhyping sin’s power and disbelieving Christ’s declaration of victory over it. Let’s receive it. Let’s accept the freedom Christ gives to those who believe.\n\nDon’t buy the propaganda that sin has power over you. Look past it. Look back to a blood-stained hill outside of Jerusalem. See, by faith, a stack of used grave clothes from your risen Friend. Look beyond what tempts you. Look to the One who saves you. \n\nIf you are in Christ, an obituary for your life in sin has been already published, and good news is printed on top: “Dead to sin. Alive in Christ.”\n\nWritten by J.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock lately, you’ve heard the phrase “love wins.” It has become a rallying cry for a collection of voices, an umbrella-like conviction wide enough for many to stand under. But while inspiring, the phrase begs for clarification because there are a number of different kinds of love in this world. \n\nC. S. Lewis highlighted four loves. Someone else might insist there are more or less, but the point is there is more than one kind of love. The sacrificial love a spouse practices on a daily basis may indeed reflect the kind of love that wins in the end, while the “I sure do love my Ford F-150” kind of love may not. So it’s not so much a wrong phrase as a vague phrase. Something more specific would serve we the people better.\n\nAnd here’s something. In today’s passage, the Apostle Paul gives us an alternative for “love wins” that covers the necessary bases. In other words, it is just as powerful while at the same time rings even more clear. Paul’s phrase? Grace wins.\n\n“Wait, isn’t there more than one kind of grace in the world as well?”\n\nYes, good catch, as there most certainly is. There is the grace the old hymn writer called “amazing” and there is also the grace said before supper. But leave it to old Paul and that thing called “context” to provide our needed clarity. When Paul uses the word “grace,” he is talking about, as one translator renders it, “aggressive forgiveness.”\n\nNow chew on that for a second or two. Grace is God’s aggressive forgiveness. And if we fancy ourselves as people of grace, which we like to believe we are, then aggressive forgiveness will be a defining characteristic of our lives as well. But far too often we practice something along the lines of dragging-our-heels forgiveness, which is why far too often we are not winning.\n\nSo grab your used copy of C. S. Lewis and drive around in your F-150 and love everything and everybody, okay? But remember—“for just as through one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous.” \n\nWhen all is said and done—when there’s a loser and a winner—grace wins.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n",

I was saving up for a ring, we were talking about our future kids, and we even began looking at neighborhoods we’d like to live in.\n\nIf I’m honest, I put my entire hope in her. I would not have said so at the time, but she was my god. I offered sacrifices at her altar daily, and I based my entire life around her wants, needs, schedule, and interests.\n\nI didn’t realize how bad it was until she broke it off. I was devastated. I’ve probably never cried more in my life than I did during that season. My god let me down—and I felt empty.\n\nPaul’s words here in Romans 5 were the words I needed that that time. He tells the church in Rome:\n\nTherefore, since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ… This hope will not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.\n\n– Romans 5:1,5\n\nI didn’t listen to those words at first, but I learned their truth in the midst of my suffering. Placing my hope in another person was futile. She was a sinner just as much as me, and she could never bear the weight of my worship.\n\nPeople aren’t built to be gods. Neither are jobs or hobbies or riches or even our best attempts at good works. None of these can fully satisfy. They’re all created things. Only the Creator deserves and can handle our worship and dependence.\n\nIf we confess Jesus as Lord, we become adopted into God’s family. “And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!” (Galatians 4:6).

Someone hires a contractor to build their home, and somewhere in the process the builder stops working, stops showing up, and abandons the project. The hopeful homeowner is stuck with a half-finished house, which is about as useful as no house at all. The frustration is great because the homeowner hired the builder to make something very important, and the builder promised to do the work to the end. The break in trust is painful.\n\nWe’re all looking for someone or something to trust in. But we live in a day where words alone don’t seem to carry much weight. Like papers blown away by a gust of wind through an open window, so go the promises people and possessions make, assuring us that we can trust in them for what our souls desperately yearn for most. \n\nThe truth is, only God can satisfy us. \n\nNo labor of our hands nor ascent of our intellects can make the promises of God come to pass. Only God can do that, and we have to trust Him. \n\nFaith is a gracious gift God gives to His children so that we might see His beauty and character. Just as a person might have surgery on his eyes enabling him to see light and color, so the Spirit of God gives us eyes of faith. When life gets hard, God can seem so far away. But when our trust is fastened to the reality of Jesus taking our sin and giving us His righteousness, we can rest in this busy and noisy world knowing we don’t have to go find Him. He has come to us through His son, Jesus. \n\nGod is not a flakey construction worker who stops in the middle of conforming us to Christ’s image. He always does what He says He will do. He will finish what He began. \n\nBecause our faith is a gift from God, anchored in the work of God, we can be certain of His faithfulness to us. “He was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification” (Romans 4:25), and nothing can take that away.\n\nWritten by Jevon Washington\n\n",

Most of us would pretty quickly answer no, we can’t. We must live by grace. We might even add that living by the law is legalism—trying to make ourselves right through actions and self-will. And we would be right to say this. Mostly.\n\nWhat sets the Christian faith apart from every other religion in the world is that we are not justified by works—that is: we are not made right and upstanding in the eyes of God because of what we do. We recognize that our works can’t accomplish this. We are justified by faith in Jesus’ perfect life, innocent death, and death-conquering resurrection. He is our atoning sacrifice—the sacrifice that takes on the punishment for another.\n\nBut so often we love to oversimplify and create “either / or” propositions out of rich and complex aspects of faith. We say we are saved by grace, not law, and while it is true that Christ’s sacrifice is the most profound act of grace in history, it happened because of the law.\n\nWe needed an atoning sacrifice to fulfill God’s law. The two are inextricably connected—God’s Law and Christ’s sacrifice. Sin could not go unpunished, and innocence cannot be handed out like candy at Halloween. God’s perfect justice led to God’s perfect mercy. So yes, we live by faith in the work of Jesus, and in so doing we are evidence that the law’s requirement was met in Christ.\n\nAnd our faith shows something more: we are now citizens of a new kingdom. We’ve been rescued from darkness and transferred to a “kingdom of light.” And what does it mean to be part of a kingdom but to be under the law of the land? We are under the new law that was ushered in through Christ’s perfect atonement—a law of grace.\n\nWe are governed by grace, shaped by grace, driven by grace. We obey God’s commands by grace and remember Christ’s work by grace. We cling to grace by faith, and so it is that we are saved by grace through faith, and that faith upholds God’s law. This is what makes us innocent in the eyes of God.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhen I was 18 years old, I was accused of a crime that I didn’t commit. In the course of affairs, I had to take a lie detector test—which I apparently failed. I was devastated. I felt guilty, even though I wasn’t. It was one of the worst experiences of my youth.  \n\nThe great irony is that I was guilty of many worse things than that for which I was falsely accused and subsequently penalized. I have revisited that experience from time to time when I consider all that the Scriptures have to say about our sinfulness before God. God’s Word is universal in the scope of its testimony about the sinfulness of humanity when it says, “There is no one righteous, not even one” (Romans 3:10).\n\nThe Apostle Paul went to great lengths in Romans 1 to set out the catalog of sins that mark the Gentile world, which includes our own. Whether it is the sexual sin and idolatry that is widespread among the nations (1:18-27), or the more general sins that mark the day-in and day-out lives of unbelievers (1:28-32), there is manifold evidence of the absolute pervasiveness of the depravity of all humankind.\n\nOf course, when we hear such an indictment, there will always those who will say, “I’m not like that. I don’t do those sorts of things. I’m not that bad.” The Apostle anticipated such objections from those he knew so well—his own countrymen! When he brings the entire Jewish nation before the divine tribunal in chapter 2, he explains that when they condemn others for sin, they must remember that they, too, are guilty of functionally practicing the same things (2:21-24).\n\nIn chapter 3, the Apostle goes on to set the entire world before the all-searching eye of God, thus leveling the the playing field. Paul explains that God gave the Law so that “every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God” (3:19). Weaving together a number of statements from the Psalms (Psalms 14:1-3; 5:9; 140:3; 10:7; 36:1), Paul explains that every part of man has been affected by sin. References to the throats, tongues, lips, mouths, feet, and eyes of men are illustrative of the fact that every part of man has been corrupted. “There is no one who seeks God” (Romans 3:11).\n\nComing to terms with the extent of our guilt before God is part of coming to see our need for Christ. Apart from the grace of God in Christ, we are spiritually hopeless, helpless, and powerless. \n\nThanks be to God that He seeks and saves sinners.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n",

Good guys and bad guys, gunslingers and cattle ranchers, A Fistful of Dollars and A Few Dollars More.\n\nThese revered moments gave real-life weight to the words of men like Clint Eastwood, Robert Duvall, and the Duke himself, John Wayne. Wayne’s call for a code is one I’ve always respected. Of course many different moral systems could be nested under the umbrella of Wayne’s famous saying. For some it’s the golden rule, and for others it’s a fiery pursuit of justice. For still others it’s the commitment to live the way their folks raised ‘em.\n\nCreeds and codes are good. But they meet their greatest contest when the proclaimer of the code fails to keep it. Whether by deliberate choice or in the face of overwhelming opposition, codes eventually break down. What we do then says more about us than any ethic ever could.\n\nPaul was confronting this gut-wrenching sort of breakdown in his letter to the Romans. For his Jewish readers, and for the God-fearing Gentiles among them, the Old Testament law was their code. It was, in it’s purest form, a gift from God. But over-legislation by the religious leaders of the day made the law a crushing and impossible burden to bear.\n\nPaul knew from personal experience that even a deeply focused life dedicated to keeping the code would fall short. This murderer-turned-apostle had seen firsthand the mangled and marred disasters that could be found in the wake of law-based living.\n\nHis question, “Do you dishonor God by breaking the law?” begs a response; and his original readers would have intuited that. He is asking us to admit our hypocrisy. Why? So we can truly live. Rather than living as creatures of the code, Paul is calling us to be people living under lavish grace.\n\nIf we feel compelled to boast, let us boast in our weakness and in God’s unmerited grace and mercy. Codes, laws, rules—these things are fundamentally helpful, but our hearts are flawed. This is why God entered our litigious and punitive world: to reset the whole broken order. Certainly, we are encouraged to live lives of virtue. I think this is where the Duke got it right. But what sets us apart as New Testament believers is our ability to hand over our shortcomings, and to lay our failures at the feet of a gracious God.\n\nBoast not in your virtue, boast not in your vice, but rather each day offer thanks to God that He covers it all. We fail, each of us, in keeping the code. But we have a Great High Priest who stands over it all. In Him, we can seek virtue, be released from the condemnation of the Law, and find a freedom and grace in Jesus that far surpasses it all.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nChildren can get easily frustrated. \n\nWhen something they try goes poorly, even if they haven’t been at it very long, they can get very frustrated. The other day I saw it happen. A kid was shooting baskets. The first shot was bad, and he got mad instead of shooting again. Maybe you know a child who loses it when he drops something, or who sits down with math homework and is beside herself with frustration in 30 seconds or less. Kids’ sensitivities run deep. One day this may serve them well, but in the moment it can be maddening.\n\nMy kids struggle with this, but they come by it naturally. When I am tired after a long day at work, I tend to do the same thing. The slightest thing can cause me to spiral into being quite a grumpy dad. Spilled coffee grounds. Not being able to watch a baseball game. Running out of bacon.\n\nWhen I get frustrated with my kids’ behavior, it is a condemnation of my own behavior.\n\nI thought about this when reading Romans 2. Paul is trying to get religious people, or at least people prone to judging other’s behavior, to see that when you are critical of others, you set yourself up for condemnation. Whether you do this with laws everyone agrees on or the Law of God, you are really pronouncing a guilty sentence on yourself. Why? Because we’re guilty of doing the things we condemn others for.\n\nBut Paul doesn’t merely want his readers to feel guilty; he wants them own it, to know it. He wants them to buy into the idea that we all suffer from the same human condition. We are all guilty before God. We all deserve His judgment. The problem is, this is so hard to get people to see. So Paul uses their own moral compass against them. Paul’s goal, of course, is not just to make sure we know our own guilt. He wants us to trace the line from guilt, to need, and then on to the good news of what God has done in Christ.\n\nWhen I see bad behavior in one of my kids, I acknowledge that behavior is wrong and I tell them they need to stop. But because I do the same, I am also judging myself and revealing my own need. I need to experience the mercy and grace of the cross afresh, just as Paul’s original audience may have needed to experience it for the first time.\n\nWe must acknowledge our incessant need for Jesus. And when I do this—when you do this—we can know God’s kindness that leads us to repentance (Romans 2:4).\n\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nIn a world full of self-worship and runaway passions, Romans 1 is arresting and sobering. This isn’t the sort of thing most folks want to talk about at your local coffee shop or over dinner and drinks. Paul directly confronts sin and brings us face to face with God’s righteous wrath. Indeed, God’s wrath, says Paul, is revealed against all ungodliness.\n\nThe judgment described is frightening. Perhaps the most frightening phrase is this: “God gave them up” (Romans 1:24). When our hearts are blind, false, desirous of carnality and evil, He gives us what we desire. To get what we want in this life is sometimes—dare I say most of the time?—not blessing, but judgment.\n\nIn his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” So also, unrighteousness anywhere is a threat to righteousness everywhere. The minute we begin condoning evil, justifying our selfishness, and excusing our pet sins, instead of repenting of them, we are asking for judgment: for blindness, darkness, waywardness, folly, debased minds, and perverse passions. \n\nIt is a slippery slope, and there aren’t any pit stops along the way. There is no “sort-of” righteous, no “halfway” committed. There is no neutrality. There is wisdom or folly, life or death. “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and discipline” (Proverbs 1:7).\n\nHowever, this talk of judgment isn’t a load of pessimism. God’s righteous wrath is the only good response to a world of sin, and even to our own rebellious hearts. It flows from the simple fact that God is good and holy. \n\nGod’s holy wrath was visited upon Christ on the cross. His righteousness triumphs; yet in the midst of His wrath, He remembers mercy. Because of this, it is possible to both tremble and to trust.\n\nI am comforted by Paul’s words in 2 Timothy 3:9: “But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all.” Folly can’t be hidden. Ungodliness and unrighteousness will be revealed for what they are. This is both sobering and glorious news. I am provoked to repentance for my own folly and unrighteousness, and also to thanksgiving for God’s faithfulness and grace. \n\nMay Christ Himself keep us and guard us from our own folly—from the love of self and the love of the world, from presumption and from pride. May He keep us in His grace, that we may fear Him all the days of our lives. Thanks be to God, and to Him alone be the glory!\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWelcome to Paul’s letter to the Romans. \n\nMartin Luther said of this epistle, “It is well worth a Christian’s while not only to memorize it word for word but also to occupy himself with it daily, as though it were the daily bread of the soul.” Why did Luther hold Romans in such high esteem? Because, he said, “this letter is truly the most important piece in the New Testament. It is purest Gospel.”\n\nWhat makes Romans so special? While all Scripture is God-breathed and equally valuable, Romans is unique in that it is the most comprehensive, well-organized expression of Christian doctrine assembled in one place in the Bible.\n\nLuther wasn’t the only person who regarded this letter in this way. Paul did too. We see this in today’s reading when Paul actually gives us his thesis for the entire book:\n\n“For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.”\n\n– Romans 1:16-17 CSB\n\nThe reason Paul is so eager to preach Christ is that he believes the gospel has the power to give life where there is none. Jesus alone is the way to salvation. The message of Christ is free to all and powerful enough to save those who believe. \n\nPaul wrote this letter to explain to Jewish and Gentile converts alike what it means to believe in and be redeemed by Jesus Christ. This book reaches back deep into the Old Testament. It walks us through the origin and problem of sin, the reality of guilt, the impossibility of saving ourselves, and the ultimate rescue we’re given in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nRomans is meant to be thorough—a practical, theological guide for the follower of Jesus. This book calls believers to trust Christ as it unfolds what it means to live by faith. By faith we anticipate our eternal home. But by that same faith, we also learn how to live as followers of Christ in this world. Romans speaks to both.\n\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ, Paul says, is the righteousness of God—meaning it is the way by which we are able to stand in the presence of God and live. In the work of Jesus, we see the character of God on display. In this letter we find a God of compassion, patience, and justice. We see unfathomable love displayed to complicated and broken people—a generosity of grace and mercy.\n\nWhether you are new to what it means to follow Christ, or you have read this letter many times over, read the book of Romans as though it is telling a single story—the story of how God rescues us through the sacrifice of Christ.\n\n Written by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod has set eternity in the heart of man (Ecclesiastes 3:11). Scripture tells us that we are wired for eternity, created for an everlasting kingdom, drawn by the Spirit to His goodness which will be fully and forever established at the end of this age.\n\nNostalgia is a strong emotion. Most of us tend to think of that feeling as a longing or yearning for a romanticized version of what once was: a childhood memory or a favorite family vacation, the most beautiful autumn day or a moment of athletic victory and the accompanying rush.\n\nI’m not the first to point it out, but I think it’s fair to acknowledge another type of nostalgia that is rooted in a holy longing for the future. Because God has set eternity in our hearts, we actually remember glimpses of what will be.\n\n“How long till the end of these wondrous things?” (Daniel 1:6). This question posed by the unknown man could just as easily come from any of us. How many times per week do you find yourself praying, lamenting, thinking, or even saying out loud, “How long?!”\n\nProbably too many times to count.\n\nIn the deepest seat of our person, as we are re-created and redeemed, the image of God in us has tremendous hope because it pre-celebrates the day when all shall be made new. When we lose sight of that eternal perspective, we ask “How long?” from a place of grief and fear. When we hold on to a God’s eye view of this life, when we recall the work that Jesus completed on our behalf, our hope and remembrance of the future is further established.\n\nAs we live in the tension of this world, between Eden and Eternity, we can cry out “How long?!” but we can also cry out in victory and hope no matter our circumstances because we remember the work of Jesus, which helps us not only confess “this too shall pass,” but “this too shall be healed.”\n\nAs was promised to Daniel, “Go on your way to the end; you will rest, and then you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance at the end of the days” (Daniel 12:13). For us, to “go your way,” is to walk in the way of Jesus, remembering eternity and living for it as He set it in our hearts.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhen we misplace our allegiance, bad things happen. In Daniel 11, we read about rulers who leave cities in ruins and many thousands of people dead. We see power change hands several times. Alliances are forged and broken. Each successive ruler seems more deceitful, arrogant, and bloodthirsty than the last.\n\nWhat are we, the modern reader, to make of all this? How can we connect our 21st century experience as Christ-followers to an obtuse summary of long-past historical events? Because we believe the whole Bible is “inspired by God and is good for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, [and] for training in righteousness” (2Timothy 3:16)—not just the inspiring verses embroidered on pillows and engraved on knickknacks in our homes, but even the obscure, seemingly irrelevant passages—we must lean into Daniel 11 and trust that God is giving us more than a dry history lesson.\n\nSo, let’s dig past the facts and look for patterns. First, we must recognize the precariousness of power. Even the mightiest and seemingly indomitable terrestrial forces eventually crumble and fall. There’s always someone bigger and stronger on the horizon looking to swallow up everything in their path.\n\nSecond, we note that the primary focus of the leaders in Daniel’s vision was their own glory and supremacy, no matter the cost. Indeed, all history reveals that as rulers become intoxicated by power, the more likely they are to demand unquestioning allegiance from those they conquer and govern. Often, they require their subjects to forsake prior loyalties, whether to governments or gods. This was as true in ancient Mesopotamia as it has been throughout the span of human affairs.\n\nWe might not be able to make a direct connection between our current experience and the historical details of Daniel’s vision, but we can be sure about how God expects us to respond to the authorities and idols that demand our devotion. Ezekiel warns God’s people about what will happen if they continue to pledge allegiance to other gods (Ezekiel 20:4–9), and over half a millennium later, Jesus mourns the result of Jerusalem continually ignoring God in favor of lesser authorities (Matthew 23:37–39).\n\nDaniel tells us that “the people who know their God will be strong and take action” (Daniel 11:32). To know God—that is, to taste and see that He is good (Psalm 34:8)—is to recognize Him for who He is: all-mighty, righteous, just, merciful, faithful, and fully invested in restoring His people. The appropriate action in response to a God like that is to prioritize Him above all other allegiances. We must follow the model of Daniel and his friends, who, under threat of persecution and death, refused to bow before any authority other than God Himself. Under His loving authority, we can rest in His strength and not in our own. Apart from God, there is no Savior (Isaiah 43:11). Where is our allegiance? To whom do we ultimately bow? What master do we truly serve?\n\nWritten by Alex Florez\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n“He’s such a little angel,” a new mom proclaims about her infant. “Look at their angelic faces,” grandparents gush about their grandkids. “He’s my guardian angel,” a woman says about a man who protects her. These are the contexts in which we most often mention anything about angels, conjuring up images of cute, cherubic, innocent, and helpful beings.\n\nBut that isn’t at all how the Bible describes angels. Throughout Scripture we see people trembling with fear and falling on their faces before these messengers of God. Daniel 10 is no exception. Of seeing the heavenly being for himself, Daniel concedes, “No strength was left in me; my face grew deathly pale, and I was powerless” (Daniel 10:7–9). Why? The description of the angel Daniel encounters surpasses our imaginations; he is glorious, beautiful, awe-inspiring, and terrifying. He is a warrior, but not like any earthly, sword-wielding hero. He brings with him heavenly glory and power.\n\nThe magnitude of angelic grandeur is so magnificent that it makes two aspects of this text stand out. First is the battle the angel is waging. He does not say he is there to protect Daniel, to sit on his shoulder and be his good conscience. The angel says he has been waging war against the prince of Persia and will continue to do so against him and the king of Greece. He is not dueling a demon; he is fighting a cosmic spiritual battle for the good nations. He is the workman of God striving for good and righteousness in the world. The spiritual struggle described in this text makes our World Wars look like brief playground spats, for the spiritual struggle is over continents, over eons, and for the destiny of the very world.\n\nWhich brings us to the second aspect of this text that stands out. After seeing the massive scale of spiritual conflict going on, it is easy to be overwhelmed. What is our place? What do we matter? The angel tells Daniel: “Don’t be afraid, you who are treasured by God. Peace to you; be very strong!” (Daniel 10:19).\n\nPeace? How? Because all who are believers are greatly loved. We can be strong and of good courage because God fights for us.\n\nYes, the fight is too big for us. We should feel like Daniel did: weak, speechless, helpless. But the words the angel spoke to him are echoed throughout Scripture. The book of Ephesians tells us that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against cosmic powers, and then it goes on to equip us with spiritual armor and weaponry for the fight (Ephesians 6:12–18). Our weapons in this fight are not of flesh but have divine power so that we can destroy arguments and lofty opinions raised against the knowledge of God (2Corinthians 10:2–5).\n\nTexts like this should rattle us. They should wake us up to the reality of evil and the even bigger reality of God and His power. He is big enough to embrace us with love and assurance while fighting our battle for the good of the world. And it is a battle He will win—or rather, a battle He has won, in Christ.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWe’re always in a battle. It isn’t really a fight against circumstances or people, but against powers, principalities, and spiritual forces (Ephesians 6:12). We certainly see the battle raging around us in the actions of men and nations, but it also rages in our own hearts.\n\nWhen Daniel read from Jeremiah 25, he didn’t forget for a moment this very biblical principle: prayer is the proper act in all times and circumstances. The particular fulfillment Daniel anticipated was one of great joy, the deliverance of Jerusalem. It would seem like the time to jump up and down and celebrate. It would be easy to be forgetful, to reflect only on the coming relief from exile, and forget that his chief call was to fix his eyes not on circumstance, but on God.\n\nDaniel’s prayer reveals much of what he believes about God, and it reveals how we, too, can walk with God in all circumstances (Daniel 9:18–19). With the promise of restoration at hand, Daniel focuses on God’s righteousness, remembering that the initial captivity of God’s people was due to His judgment against their sin and idolatry. Recognizing the people’s rebellious and forgetful nature, and not presuming God’s mercies, Daniel prays before his holy God, “Lord, righteousness belongs to you” (v.7). It’s a prayer that offers us clear principles for how we can approach the Lord and His instruction.\n\nFirst, God’s faithfulness doesn’t eliminate our need for prayers, but galvanizes it. In the face of blessing, the natural inclination of the human heart is self-congratulation. We like to take credit for the good stuff (but not the bad), and tell ourselves, “I must have done something good to deserve this.” But Daniel reminds us that every good gift is from God (James 1:17) and depends wholly upon His grace. Therefore, blessing should humble us.\n\nSecond, prayer fixes our thoughts on God, rather than the world. Worry, fear, materialism, and selfishness all grow dim in the light of Christ. Our petitions are first and foremost to be for His glory as we seek first the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 6:33), just as Daniel petitions God to act for the sake of His own glory.\n\nThird, prayer recognizes both God’s goodness and greatness. Because of His goodness, we are called by His name and enjoy the security and joy of salvation. Because of His grace, we can approach Him with confidence that He hears all our petitions and confessions. Because of His greatness, we know He has the power and authority to answer.\n\nAnd He does answer! God responds to Daniel not only with the assurance of Jerusalem’s restoration, but with the promise of “the Anointed One” who will satisfy the need for offerings and sacrifices and judge the destruction of the destroyer (Daniel 9:25–27). Once dead in our sin, we are now made alive in Christ Jesus. It is by grace that we have been saved, which means that the righteousness of our Lord is now our righteousness as well (Ephesians 2:1,5; Daniel 9:7).\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Vision of a Ram and a Goat",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nWe are all fascinated by the end times. The proliferation of post-apocalyptic films and literature, and the numerous theories, interpretations, and speculations regarding books of end-times prophecy, raptures, judgments, and visions are everywhere. And, the end times are not a fascination merely of Christian culture, but of all cultures—from the Ragnarok of the vikings, to the promise of global warming, environmental doom, and nuclear self-destruction preached in the present—we want to know how it all ends. Knowing the end is part of knowing the present. We know ourselves now both by the record of the past and the hope or fear of the future.\n\nOf course, our knowledge is limited. We’d like to have a clear timeline, a chart with breakdowns of all the specifics. Remarkably, that is very much what we find in Daniel 8. Daniel is given not only a spectacular vision of the future, but also a specific interpretation: “the vision refers to the time of the end” (Daniel 8:17). Yet at the end, we are told he still “could not understand it” (v.27). This is the same response we see in Jesus’s disciples when He very specifically explained His coming death, resurrection, and ascension. Every time, no matter how clearly the matter was imparted, those who received the foretelling could not understand. And so it is with us. Even when God gives us everything we need to know, we’re still left scratching our heads.\n\nBut that is part of the good news. God does not do His work according to human wisdom or to suit human wishes. He does not deliver His message to cater to our curiosity. He delivers to us a clear revelation of His nature, His character, His sovereign providence—and calls us to simply walk in it. We don’t have to understand everything. We are called to simply trust Him.\n\nAnd that trust is not misplaced. The events foretold to Daniel in this vision of the ram and the goat would not take place for another 350 years, yet they happened with the rise and fall of the Medo-Persian empire, the ascension of Alexander the Great and the division of his kingdom, followed by the abominations of Antiochus Epiphanes. \n\nWhile this 20/20 hindsight doesn’t fully satisfy our desire for apocalyptic insight, it is also not the main point of scriptural prophecy. Prophetic interpretation, even for Daniel, was never designed to boost pride. It was and always is about God’s work in the world. And while our initial understanding is dim, the end point of biblical eschatology is always optimistic. The angel that appeared to Daniel assured him that all these things would come to pass by God’s own righteous decree, and “not by human hands” (Daniel 8:25). In the same way, Christ spoke to His disciples of the end times, saying, “Be courageous! I have conquered the world” (John 16:33).\n\nThough we may, like Daniel, be “overcome and sick for days” when we look at the state of the world, and wonder how it can all possibly come to good, we are called to remember that our good and righteous God is at work. Therefore, we can rise like Daniel, and go about the business that God has set before us. We can be of good courage, knowing that the end of the story is not the triumph of wickedness, but the victory of Christ. We can take heart, because it does not depend upon us, but upon God, who is at work in time, in space, in history, and will guide the present and the future as He has guided the past. Though the world may appear to be upended by affliction, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, and danger, in all these things we are more than conquerors in Christ who rules and reigns forever (Romans 8:37–39).\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nScripture records many of the promises of Jesus. Two of those promises that have often brought me comfort and hope in the midst of challenge are seemingly contradictory, but time and time again they’ve proven themselves to work in unity. Take Jesus’s words in John 16:33: “You will have suffering in this world,” but “Be courageous! I have conquered the world.”\n\nDaniel lived in a time of exile. He was held captive in a foreign land as his home and countrymen were systematically dismantled and dispersed. He did not need many reminders that followers of God experience trouble in this world. And while his life predated that of Jesus by several hundred years, it seems that Daniel also understood clearly that God-fearers need not fear the powers of this world. \n\nThere are entire books written about our passage for today. And there are many, hotly debated interpretations that attempt to parse out various aspects of Daniel’s vision. One thing that interpreters seem to universally agree upon is that, in the end, God establishes His kingdom and kingdom people forever and ever. Daniel proclaims in no uncertain terms: “But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever” (Daniel 7:18). Amen. May it be so. \n\nWhen all is said and done, when all the kingdoms have conquered and then in turn fallen, when all the histories have finally been written, God’s purposes and love will be perfectly and eternally established and experienced. \n\nDaniel lived in exile, but Daniel hoped in the future kingdom. I think most of us can identify with that. Most days we experience life somewhere between exile and the fullness of the kingdom. We live in between the promise of suffering in this world and Jesus’s encouragement to have faith that He has more than conquered this world.\n\nIn almost any 24-hour period, we ebb and flow between the lows of “now” and the hope and healing of “not yet, but coming!” Kingdoms come and go but the City of God is forever (Revelation 11:15). It will outlast and overcome every oppressive system, every injustice, and every wrong doing. It will bring peace and freedom, wholeness and stability. \n\nDaniel was greatly alarmed by his vision. He saw death and destruction at the center of every one of those kingdoms and their pursuit of power and control. But he knew the end of the story. And so do we. Take heart, saints of the Most High. \n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n",

But the Jesus of Scripture is also one of unmatched power and authority. One that compels people to fall on their knees in worship. Today’s passage serves up a powerful image of this Jesus.\n\nYou’ve seen it in a hundred movies: the good guys finally meet their mysterious foe, only to discover he is so much more powerful than they ever could have imagined. The beast rises from the ocean and blocks the light of the sun. The harbor looks like nothing more than a puddle. Military missiles bounce off like nerf darts. The only realistic response is to abandon all hope. \n\nDaniel 7 opens like one of these movies. Daniel dreams about four beasts, which verse 17 says are four kings who shall arise out of the earth—perhaps Babylon, Medo-Persia, Alexander the Great’s conquest, and the Roman Empire, respectively. The creatures are strong and horrifying, the kind you would presume would destroy you like you destroy a mosquito. They take your breath away and sever your courage. And each one is more terrifying and ruthless than the one before. No doubt the exiles of Judah would have felt the chilling reality of this imagery.\n\nSuddenly, a throne room—or better, a courtroom—comes down in their midst (Daniel 7:13). God Himself, the Ancient of Days, sits on the center throne. Here Scripture gives us a rare personified description of God the Father: He has pure white hair, clothing white as snow, a chariot-like throne of fire. Thousands surrounded Him, serving Him and listening to Him. Here, the Lord is not like the four ferocious beasts, hungry for blood and bent on destruction. Instead, He is the picture of strength that comes from wisdom and the power of righteousness. He doesn’t inspire fear, but worship.\n\nIn a moment, the greatest beast was destroyed, and the power of the others was taken away. Then, from heaven, came the Son of Man, to whom the Ancient of Days gave all authority and dominion. Daniel says God gave Him glory and a kingdom which would draw people from all nations to worship and serve Him. His dominion would never end and His kingdom would never be destroyed.\n\nIn Mark 14:62, Jesus says the Son of Man that Daniel saw was, in fact, Jesus Himself. He wasn’t just referring to His first coming, but His second, when He will descend to establish His kingdom forever. When you think about Jesus, or pray, or worry about seemingly insurmountable obstacles, picture this Jesus. \n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nDaniel’s deliverance is probably one of the most triumphant narratives in the Bible. The Black preacher would assert that Daniel was not in the lions’ den, but the lions were in Daniel’s den. God transformed the nature of the lions that they served as a mattress and pillow for Daniel as he slumbered all night. Situations and undesirable scenarios do not thwart the hope of the people of God. God’s power is not limited to the powerful and dominant but ever present in the life of God’s people. \n\nWe miss an essential aspect of the sixth chapter of Daniel by neglecting to give attention to the devotion of Daniel to God. Daniel’s devotional life became evident even to his colleagues, so much so that they desired to use it against Daniel. Daniel has the reputation amongst his colleagues that faith does not simply serve as a guide but most importantly as an anchor into who he is. His devotion to God led to a deeper experience of the omnipotent essence of God. And God invites you and I to experience this same power today.\n\nThree times a day he got down on his knees,\n\nprayed, and gave thanks to his God,\n\njust as he had done before (Daniel 6:10).\n\nDaniel displays that a life devoted to God yields a hope for the people rooted in divine courage. When King Darius declares himself the only “deity” the people should pray to, Daniel continues to commit himself to God and His ways. Despite the king’s decree, Daniel submits himself, offering a “yes” to God and a “no” to Darius, at the cost of his political affiliation, and potentially, even his life. \n\nOur devotion to God invites us along a journey of commitment. Daniel exhibits to us all that we should choose character over comfort. Social status and standing do not satisfy a heart that desires to be in communion with God. Just as a tea bag placed under heat will render a liquid with the contents that it is composed of, devotion met with disturbance reveals the true essence of our commitment to God. \n\nIn the swift transitions of life, our devotion serves to draw us closer to God and not simply to drift away. Daniel’s devotion leads us to explore how to live out our beliefs in a world that seems to discount the devotion of believers. Daniel’s adversaries envied the reputation and rank of their colleague. They knew that the place to push Daniel would be in his devotion to God. But Daniel’s steady confidence and peace in the Lord only point all the more to God’s divine faithfulness to those who trust in Him. \n\nWritten by Cameron Thomas\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Handwriting on the Wall",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhen I was five years old, my father left and never came back. Ever since, an urgent, demanding question has flashed in glaring red letters on the walls of my heart: ARE YOU GOOD ENOUGH?\n\nFor so long, the answer to this question was simple: No way. I’m not good enough. Every day my father chose not to return, that self-evaluation set like concrete, creating an increasing sense of inadequacy. I have often whispered to myself, in the quiet of my soul, that I will never be good enough for anyone, for any purpose, under any circumstances.\n\nI think everyone faces some version of the same question: Am I good enough? Do I measure up? These questions and the varied answers that spring into one’s consciousness comprise the driving forces of our decision-making, our thoughts, our relationships, our actions, and naturally, our understanding of self.\n\n“You have been weighed on the balance and found deficient” (Daniel 5:27). The writing on the wall may have been directed at Belshazzar, but Daniel’s interpretation feels personal.\n\nBut I have something Belshazzar did not. Notice Daniel’s insight in verse 23 when he tells the king, “You have not glorified the God who holds your life-breath in his hand and who controls the whole course of your life.” What Belshazzar lacks is reverence for the one true God; it’s his failure to acknowledge the supremacy of the Lord that renders him inadequate.\n\nGod’s expectation for human beings is perfect holiness (1Peter 1:16), and through the lens of my own lifelong battle with self-worth, I recognize that I fall far short of perfect holiness. At my worst, I am self-absorbed, obsessed with avoiding pain, and addicted to pleasure and comfort. If being “good enough” for myself has been difficult, then being good enough for God on my own merits is impossible.\n\nHowever, there is something new in me that refutes the slanderous voices within. My faith in Jesus—a gift from God, not something I earned for myself—allows me to stand at peace with God (Romans 5:1). Because of Jesus, God sees me as holy and blameless (Ephesians 1:4). I am no longer a little boy who wasn’t good enough for his earthly father; I am an adopted son whom God is pleased to call His own (v.5).\n\nAs a son of the King, I glorify God and trust Him as He directs the course of my life. No longer am I bound in the mire of self-loathing. Instead, I humble myself before God, confident that in the shadow of His wings (Psalm 63:7–8) my heart can soar to the heights of heaven. Because of Jesus, I discover that I am good enough—not because of what I’ve done or haven’t done, not because of who I am or who I am not. I am counted as treasured and prized (1Peter 2:9) because of who He is and what He has done for me.\n\nWritten by Alex Florez\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Nebuchadnezzar’s Proclamation",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nThroughout the middle books of the Old Testament, Nebuchadnezzar’s kingdom was the greatest rival to Judah. In Daniel 4, God finally intervened and humbled the ruler of Babylon who had twice besieged Jerusalem, humiliating her kings, plundering and destroying the temple, and then carrying off God’s people into the exile. But it was not for any of these acts alone that God caused Nebuchadnezzar to fall from power. It was the king’s pride.\n\nWhile Nebuchadnezzar tried to establish himself as a god, unsettling visions haunted his dreams. He confided them to Daniel: a tree towering over the earth, a pronouncement from heaven, and it was cut down and watered by the dew. Daniel explained that Nebuchadnezzar was the tree, and God was going to cut him down. The prophet advised the king to repent. Instead, Nebuchadnezzar stood at the height of Babylon and proclaimed that the city existed to display his “majestic glory” (Daniel 4:30).\n\nBut before he could finish saying this, his mind left him. Nebuchadnezzar left the luxury of Babylon and lived as an animal in the wilderness for seven years. Instead of royal food, he ate grass and his hair and fingernails grew until he was compared to an eagle. This lasted until he repented. Finally, instead of his own glory, Nebuchadnezzar humbly praised God:\n\n“For his dominion is an everlasting dominion, \n\nand his kingdom is from generation to generation” (Daniel 4:34).\n\nProverbs says that “pride comes before destruction, and an arrogant spirit before a fall” (Proverbs 16:18). As I reflect on this story, I’m convicted to repent of my own pride, knowing that it is not a “minor sin.” It’s not as if Nebuchadnezzar was prouder than you or I—after all, he was wrong about his boast, and if his pride was reason enough for God to humble him, then everyone will be humbled. Daniel warned Nebuchadnezzar, “Separate yourself from your sins by doing what is right…. Perhaps there will be an extension of your prosperity” (v.27). Only after years spent in the wild, did Nebuchadnezzar heed Daniel’s advice. And after he did, his prosperity was indeed extended.\n\nIf God has already driven you into the wilderness and torn down the idols you built of yourself, see in this story how His discipline is also His grace. When Nebuchadnezzar’s reckoning came, it led him to repent. The dew of heaven that soaked Nebuchadnezzar was not judgment but provision. (Remember how the manna came with the dew for the Israelites during their own time of humbling? [Exodus 16:13–14]). This great villain of the Old Testament has a happy ending, praising God; his own testimony is recorded in Daniel 4. If God’s grace extended to Nebuchadnezzar, then it extends to everyone.\n\nBefore his humiliation, Nebuchadnezzar boasted of building Babylon. After his time in the wild, he admitted, no one on earth can put their achievement against God’s and ask him, “What have you done?” (Daniel 4:35). God uses despised things, like Nebuchadnezzar’s madness and wildness, to destroy our illusion that we are the architect and builder of our own kingdoms, that the world exists for us. No one can boast in God’s presence (1Corinthians 1:31).\n\nWritten by David Chaniott\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Delivered from the Fire",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod’s people always had enemies: the Egyptians, the Philistines, the Midianites, the Babylonians. And in almost every situation, the story was the same. The enemies would make life for Israel miserable. And when enemies became occupiers, they’d make idolatry tempting. Submitting to an invading ruler’s gods often brought worldly comforts. But though they forgot Him, God never forgot His people. He’d send deliverers to rescue them. Sometimes the rescuers would actually go out and fight the enemies (think Gideon or David). But others would take action by serving wisely from within the government. That was the case in Babylon. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego simply waited out the exile with defiance until God showed up.\n\nThat approach wasn’t easy, because these three friends served under a megalomaniac. Nebuchadnezzar was the mightiest king in the world, and he knew it: “Build a golden statue. Make it look like me. Gather my officials. Play a song about me. Then, bow down and worship!” Can you imagine? Nebuchadnezzar loved to hear people say he was the greatest; he wanted everyone to worship him, and he wanted it so badly that he started issuing threats: “Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire” (Daniel 3:6).\n\nHow do you live in Babylon under that sort of rule? Sometimes it’s hard to stand up for what’s right when everyone around us is more concerned with their worldly success, when others love their lives more than God. But these three men stood defiantly. When the haughty king heard about their protest, he was furious. (I imagine him turning bright red and calling them some pretty nasty names.) Nevertheless, the friends replied: “If the God we serve exists, then he can rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire, and he can rescue us from the power of you, the king. But even if he does not rescue us, we want you as king to know that we will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up” (Daniel 3:17–18). Incensed, the king turned up the heat and threw the three dissidents into the furnace.\n\nI’m sure Nebuchadnezzar thought he’d proven his point, but when he squinted and looked into the furnace, he said, “Look! I see four men, not tied, walking around in the fire unharmed; and the fourth looks like a son of the gods” (v.25). The three friends stood together, and their God stood with them. Even narcissistic Nebuchadnezzar was forced to admit, “There is no other god who is able to deliver like this” (v.29).\n\nGod saved His people in their darkest moment. He was with them, like Jesus took on our sin and stood in our place on the cross. That reality gives us hope when we’re living in a world that too easily bends to ungodly rule for the sake of comfort. In the midst of the temptation to bow, we can stand defiantly, too, trusting in the one, true God. After all, we still serve a God who delivers through fire.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Daniel Interprets the Dream",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nI’ve had some weird dreams in my life: being kidnapped by the Wicked Witch of the West, having a co-worker as a parent, finding myself at school with no pants. Never, though, have I been so troubled as to seek interpretation for these as seminal messages for my future, let alone threatening the lives of any who failed to interpret them well. When we read Daniel chapter two, we see that this is the very threat Daniel found himself on the receiving end of.\n\nDaniel acted boldly. Just as we saw the presence and power of God with Daniel in giving him the interpretation, we see it in his response to the king. He entered Nebuchadnezzar’s court and declared that no person could interpret the dream, but informed him that “there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries,” one who will make known its meaning (Daniel 2:28). He claims no wisdom or power of his own, but instead, boldly points to the true God as the source of this revelation.\n\nIn doing so, Daniel acts in faith and exemplifies what Jesus later declares in Luke 12: “Anyone who acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him… the Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what must be said” (vv.8,12). Daniel not only acknowledged God before men, but he did so in the highest court in the land and at risk of His own life, believing God would give him the words to say. He trusted and he obeyed, believing in “the God of the heavens” who would “set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed” (Daniel 2:44).\n\nThe dream itself tells of a succession of kingdoms with varying levels of glory and strength which crumbled by “a stone [that] broke off without a hand touching it” and “became a great mountain that filled the whole earth.” Daniel’s interpretation of this dream is striking as well (Daniel 2:34,35). He isn’t just predicting future power clashes and regime changes; he is describing how God gives power to kings, and then goes on to say “in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed” (v.44).\n\nSo in the presence of the most powerful man in the world, as a prisoner in the midst of humiliating exile, Daniel proclaims the everlasting supremacy of Christ’s kingdom. We often think of this only in terms of individual souls being saved, but Daniel is foretelling what Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 15: “He must reign until he puts all his enemies under his feet” (v.25). Jesus came to save and change hearts, but He is a conquering King as well, defeating all enemies, all evil, all death (v.26). And unlike every man-built kingdom, His reign will last for eternity. For Daniel, these must have been words that simultaneously made him fear for his life yet gave him hope for the future. We know the story, though. We know how Christ struck the death blow to death, once and for all time. So for us, these are words that are sure and sealed and fill us with hope for His return.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nNothing saps hope like an impossible situation. Anyone who has been in such a scenario knows that helplessness is often the herald of hopelessness. Given his impossible circumstances, we might expect to find Daniel drained of all hope and faith, but surprisingly, we discover the opposite to be true.\n\nDaniel’s impossible situation is two-fold. First, King Nebuchadnezzar is demanding what his advisors say no one on earth can do: to not only interpret the king’s dream, but to divine the content of that dream out of thin air. When they inevitably fail this impossible task, the king gives orders to execute them, their families, and all his other advisors, Daniel included. This is the first problem, and it’s a big one.\n\nThe second problem has less to do with the impossible task and more to do with the impossible man, King Nebuchadnezzar himself. As the saying goes, “Absolute power corrupts absolutely,” and this is on full display as the king of Babylon shows his penchant for arbitrary violence. The impossible task aside, if he survives this conflict, Daniel has to find a way to live in a nation that is ruled by the whims of this impossible man.\n\nYet, in the midst of it all, Daniel maintains his hope and trust in the Lord. You see, Daniel knew that despite all the raging of King Nebuchadnezzar, the Lord’s good purposes for him would prevail. Nebuchadnezzar may be king of the world, but Daniel knew that the King of heaven is the one who “changes the times and seasons; he removes kings and establishes kings” (Daniel 2:21). What fueled Daniel’s hope and faith was the truth that no power on earth could stand against the plans of the God of the heavens.\n\nThere is no greater example of this truth played out in the annals of history than in the story of Jesus’s resurrection. No situation is more hopeless than the grave, but even death could not stop the redemptive purposes of God. Christ’s resurrection exposes the futility of any effort to thwart the progress of God’s kingdom. Neither the mightiest of kings nor the cruelest of deaths can impede God’s good purposes for His people. This truth sustains our hope and faith in the face of seemingly impossible situations.\n\nAt the end of their rope, Nebuchadnezzar’s advisors lost all hope, while “Daniel praised the God of the heavens (v.19).” The prophet knew that nothing could derail what God had in store for his life, and the same is true for us today. No matter how bleak our situation, there is nothing that can spoil God’s plans for us. Let that truth be the fuel that animates our hope and trust, come what may.\n\nWritten by Collin Ross\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nI’ll never forget the first day I arrived on my college campus. There was a desire for a freedom in my soul that I had not experienced as a child—at least I thought it was freedom.\n\nI wondered what it would be like to touch, smell, and taste the things that I had been kept from by my parents. I just wanted to test and see what the world had to offer. The parties, the alcohol, and the access to explore cheap relationships all enticed me even as I sought to stand strong in the faith I’d received.\n\nBut within a few short days of arriving, my appetites began to be saturated with worldly desires. And it was within days of arriving that my faith would be challenged by my professors. That campus would become a battlefield for my soul and a war fighting for my appetites, education, and good name.\n\nI imagine the experience I share with many was what teenaged Daniel faced as he left the ordered and comfortable land of Israel for the chaotic and hedonistic world of Babylon, forced to venture out of the sure safety of his people’s protective arms for the dangerous wild of the Chaldeans.\n\nYet Daniel’s faith in the Lord was incredibly strong. He had determined in his heart to be faithful to the living God, even as a foreigner and an exile to the kingdom of Babylon, knowing that the food, wine, and worship that they had in store for him would be detrimental to His relationship with God and the rich heritage he had known among the people of God. And as an act of generosity, the Lord granted Daniel both kindness and compassion from those he would serve (Daniel 1:9).\n\nIt was Daniel’s grit that gave him the determination to stand apart. But it would be God’s favor combined with Daniel’s intelligence that allowed him to remain in good standing with the officials and the king. He used his influence and winsomeness to position himself to honor God and honor the king, simultaneously.\n\nThe story of Daniel not defiling himself before the king while growing in influence in the Babylonian empire gives us a front-row seat to what faithfulness looks like in the corrupt world we find ourselves in today. It’s a reminder that we, too, can choose to live above sin while still living in this world. And it’s an encouragement for us to engage with the world around us while not compromising the holiness that God seeks to display through our stories.\n\nWe can have both: We can honor God and we can honor humanity, His creation. We can live for the kingdom of God while still living in the kingdom of darkness. But it requires abstinence and submission; abstinence from what we know would displease God and submission to the people He puts in our path as leaders and authorities. Daniel knew how to stand in the balance. Oh, that God would empower us by His Spirit to stand firm in the faith like Daniel.\n\nWritten by Jonathan Pitts\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nNot to beat a dead horse, but pandemics stink. One of the toughest realities of living in a COVID-19 world, outside of the horrible medical realities, is how it has disrupted our lives. At the start of the year, things were humming along as usual for most of us, and then, in a matter of just a few weeks, the world started shutting down. We lost our rhythms and routines. We lost our ability to plan for the coming months. We lost many of the plans we’d already made.\n\nGoing through something like this helps prepare us to come to a book like Daniel, because Daniel tells the story of an exile—Judah’s captivity in Babylon. Life in Judah was moving right along when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came and carried off many of God’s people to live in another land (Daniel 1:2), under the control of another ruler, surrounded by the gods of another religion. Appreciate the difficulty and trauma this must have added to the already complicated lives of the people of Judah.\n\nIn these opening verses, we catch a glimpse of King Nebuchadnezzar’s strategy. To get Judah to accept their fate, he took some of the royal, noble, and beautiful people of Israel into his own home. There he would teach them the ways of the Chaldeans. They would eat at his table, read his literature, learn his language, and—in a final coup d’état—worship him. He wanted the people of Judah to abandon their faith in God and embrace a culture where the people bowed before the king in worship.\n\nAmong these people we see four names: Daniel, Meshach, Shadrach, and Abednego. What would they do? Where would God be in the midst of their suffering and trials? That’s where the rest of this book goes.\n\nAs we begin reading through Daniel, ask yourself these questions: In the face of exile, how did God’s people respond? What role did God play in their trials? What did faithfulness look like? What did unfaithfulness look like? What does exile for God’s people look like today? Where are people of faith being urged to abandon faith in order to assimilate into another culture? For what purpose? What does it look like to remain faithful?\n\nWhenever we get disoriented, it can be hard to remember which way is up. When we’re in a position of weakness or change, it can be difficult to know how to move forward in healthy, upright ways. Good news! One of the themes running through the book of Daniel is that God is exceedingly more present and active than anyone would have imagined. And that God is the same, yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8).\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nIf you’ve never taught a room full of 5th graders a Bible lesson right before lunch, let me paint you a picture. With each passing minute, they become increasingly restless, and they cannot resist the urge to squirm, wiggle, sigh, and fidget. There I am, pouring my heart out, and I can’t understand why they aren’t sitting still and listening with rapt attention. But you see, I am the one thing standing between them and having lunch, laughing out loud, and enjoying each other’s company. In short, I don’t stand a chance by the end of class.\n\nParents and teachers attempt to train children to exhibit self-control, though it runs counter to everything their bodies and minds are telling them: Get up! Move! Run! Laugh! Move some more! They seem determined to rail against any directive to control themselves physically. (It would seem the training has not been effective.)\n\nMeanwhile, I’m facing my own internal struggle. As I push through my lesson, straining toward the finish line, I grow more and more impatient with the rising tide of squirminess. My heartbeat quickens as initially innocent wiggles evolve into a full-blown mutiny against my authority. At this point, I am outside of myself; any internal fortitude of my own has been exhausted. There’s nothing I can do by my own strength to meet this ostensible insubordination with the peace, patience, gentleness, and joy that I know the Lord desires from me, and that I know the children need.\n\nIronically, I’m standing before them essentially preaching the “more excellent way” of love in Christ, and I am on the verge of demonstrating the exact opposite. How much easier it would be to raise my voice and foam at the mouth in order to regain control of the class! Students sense the end of class, and some of them start to pack up because they just can’t sit still one moment longer. Chicken tenders and chocolate milk are just around the corner, and they have forgotten I exist. As I feel myself teeter over the edge, I am convicted by the words of Matthew 23: I am like a whitewashed tomb, appearing righteous and clean on the outside, but filled with hypocrisy and wickedness (vv.27–28).\n\n“Now everyone who competes exercises self-control in everything.\n\nThey do it to receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable crown” (1Corinthians 9:25).\n\nBut I simply cannot manufacture the self-control I require. If I rely on my own strength, I become a blind and ineffective guide to the precious children He has placed in my care. I need to remember that the Spirit of the Lord lives within me, bringing freedom. As I contemplate His glory, I recall His promise to transform me into His image (2Corinthians 3:18). I need the Lord Himself to bear the fruit of His Spirit within me. Only then can I exercise the self-control I need to love my students as Jesus would have me love them—with justice and mercy, with faithfulness and patience, with peace and gentleness.\n\nWritten by Alex Florez\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nI believe it was C. S. Lewis who once said that “humility is not thinking less of yourself, it is thinking of yourself less.” In a world where the individual self reigns sovereign, this is a profound challenge. I’d imagine that most of us think about ourselves far more often than we consider others.\n\nPaul describes “gentleness” as the fruit of the Spirit in our lives, which has a direct tie to our consideration of others. To be gentle, one must be humble. If one is not humble, they will be self-absorbed and consider themselves superior to others. When you view others as inferior, it will manifest in actions that are aggressive, bitter, and angry.\n\nAs we search the Bible for the archetype of gentleness, the example of a shepherd should come to the forefront of our minds. The imagery of shepherding is interwoven in the scriptures as a metaphor for provision, protection, and guidance. More often than not, we tend to focus on the actions of shepherding—that is, leading the flocks through harsh environments, protecting them from predators. However, if we consider the motivation behind these actions, we come to see that a shepherd leads and protects the flock because he cares for them. Isaiah provides a good picture of a caring shepherd:\n\nHe tends his flock like a shepherd:\n\nHe gathers the lambs in his arms\n\nand carries them close to his heart;\n\nhe gently leads those that have young rest (Isaiah 40:11).\n\nIn the ancient world, Bedouin shepherds knew every member of their flocks in terms of their birth circumstances, history of health, eating habits, and other idiosyncrasies. To know each member of the flock requires time and attention. A true shepherd demonstrates both strength and tender compassion. When Isaiah speaks of a shepherd who carries the flock close to his heart, we are given this imagery of tender reassurance, encouragement, and hope. Notice that the shepherd gently leads the flock by paying attention to their needs, and in doing so, aims to refresh the weary who are downtrodden from the wilderness of everyday life.\n\nAs we reflect on our own relationships in an effort to cultivate gentleness, it is important that we assess our disposition towards others. Are we gentle and self-forgetful, that is, placing the needs of others over our own? Or are we self-absorbed in such a way that we become bitter and angry when others’ needs get in the way of our own agendas?\n\nConsider for a moment those whom God has placed around you. Who is burdened and needs support? Who is down and needs encouragement? Someone should come to mind. And your initial thought might be, “But, that will require a lot of time and energy on my part.” The good news is, because gentleness is from the Spirit, God will empower you to exercise His gift if you seek His help in prayer. As you finish reading this devotional, spend a few minutes asking God to soften your heart toward those He has placed on your mind. Ask Him to provide practical ways for you to serve them, and thus, walk in the Spirit of gentleness. In doing this, you will live according to God’s will and be conformed to the image of Christ, the Good Shepherd.\n\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n“God, would you send me someone that I can pour my life into? Would you give me a guy that I can help to know you better?”\n\nThis is a heartfelt prayer I’ve prayed for years. I always thought that would mean me leading a Bible study at Starbucks or having a small group of guys in my home that I’d read Scripture with. There was nothing wrong with those things, but they never seemed to be His answer to my prayer. But I’ll never forget the day that God opened my eyes to how faithful He had been all along.\n\n“Margret and Aaron are coming to stay with us,” my wife said.\n\n“For a few days?” I asked.\n\n“Uh, I’m not sure, but Aaron is trying out for a professional basketball team, and I told them they can stay as long as they need to.”\n\nI knew Margret well, but Aaron I barely knew. That would change quickly because for a full summer we hosted this young married couple in our home. He taught me how to look respectable with a basketball in my hand. They spent time with our daughters and gave us breaks from parenting. It was a really beautiful time.\n\nI moved about my life very normally in front of them. But one day, sitting at dinner, I held a short devotional with my family like I always do when we sit together. At the very end, Aaron asked me a question that changed everything. “What was that?” he asked. It took me a while to figure out what He was asking, but he had never seen a father sit around a table and lead his family in God’s Word. I laughed and gently described “family devotions” to him. From that point on, I realized that God was using the faithfulness He had developed in me to help develop faithfulness in Aaron. And it felt like I was doing nothing at all. Now, years later, Aaron teaches his own two young sons around their table.\n\nAnd that’s the God we serve. He is “the faithful God who keeps his gracious covenant loyalty for a thousand generations with those who love him and keep his commands” (Deuteronomy 7:9).\n\nHis faithfulness was preparing me to disciple Aaron. His faithfulness was drawing Aaron deeper into who He was. His faithful love is continuing on to Aaron’s next generation of sons as he faithfully passes on what God is doing in his own heart. And it all started with a prayer calling on God’s faithfulness.\n\nI now look back and realize there were more answers to my prayer. There were Kameron and Brianna. There was Isaac and there was Rodney. God was faithfully weaving the love of Jesus in and through me to others in His own ways and in His own time. All I needed to do was to call on His faithfulness, trusting He would answer. Trusting that He would work through me. And I still do. Will you call on His faithfulness today, expecting Him to give it to you and display it through you?\n\nWritten by Jonathan Pitts\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Goodness",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nGood food. Good company. Good morals. Good taste. Good times. Good vibes—we love good things, right? We use the word “good” in a wide variety of contexts. We tend to talk of goodness as a thing unto itself, a judgment call made on the basis of personal preference. We think of goodness as positivity and happiness, even of trite and passing pleasures, so much so that we are prone to lose sight of the profundity of its meaning.\n\nBut Scripture is clear: goodness does not exist apart from the presence of God. Consider Jesus’s interaction with the rich young ruler in the Gospel of Mark. When the young man called Him “Good Teacher,” Jesus confronted him: “‘Why do you call me good?… No one is good except God alone’” (Mark 10:18).\n\nGoodness is only found with God. Goodness is His glory, His favor, and His presence (Exodus 33:12–19). Goodness is His activity for the blessing of His people, and for a witness to the nations (Psalm 31:19). Goodness is the root of joy and gladness, the ground of fruitfulness, and the satisfaction, consolation, and refreshment of the soul, found only in God (Jeremiah 31:12–14). Goodness is the fruit of God’s own light, and transforms us in Christ (Ephesians 5:9).\n\nYet, despite this, we are prone to look for goodness in just about every other place, even in “good” things: in family and friends, in tranquility and comfort, in victory and success, in hard work and productivity, in neighborliness and hospitality. But if we supplant the goodness of God with the virtues of our own efforts, we have utterly failed to understand the God of Scripture. To look for the good life in any place except the gospel is folly.\n\nGod alone is good, but God is also astoundingly generous with His goodness, so much so that He offers it to us. He makes His goodness ours. Moses beheld the goodness of God as it passed by him on the mountain (Exodus 33:18–19), but Christ reveals to us that same glory, not on a mountain, but by the indwelling of His Spirit. “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). He, with all His goodness, dwelt among us, and His Spirit now dwells within us.\n\nThis, then, becomes the foundation of the fruitful Christian life. If there is to be any excellence or virtue in our walk in this world, we must abide in Christ and walk by His Spirit. The evangelistic call of the gospel is never simply an offer of escape from judgment. It is always also an invitation to come to the bounty of God’s dwelling place. Men may search for success, joy, comfort, and peace in many places, hoping somehow to find the good life on their own, but true goodness can only be found where the Spirit of Christ is, the mark of the Holy Spirit’s fruitfulness in our lives.\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Kindness",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nI’m not exactly sure when it happened, but at some point I started ending my prayers by thanking God for His kindness to us in Christ. If you are part of the church I pastor, you hear me say it at some point in every service. It was never an intentional thing—more of a response. But the older I get, the more I associate the essence of the gospel with kindness.\n\nFor us to understand this aspect of the fruit of the Spirit in our own lives, we should ask how it works in God. God’s kindness that leads to peace is intensely relational. It’s about more than being nice. It’s about being aware of others and relationally accessible and available to them.\n\nFor us, that looks like thinking of others before ourselves (Philippians 2:1–4). Kindness desires and pursues another’s well-being. It is seeing when someone you know is hurting, perhaps at church, and not walking past them, but stopping to see how they are. Kindness is marked by careful listening and general warmth, giving the gift of unhurried time to others.\n\nThe Holy Spirit works to bear this fruit in the character and actions of His people so that we might reflect this aspect of God’s character as light in a dark world. For this to happen, the Holy Spirit must also uproot things growing in our hearts in the place of kindness. Just as there is fruit of the Spirit, so there are weeds of the flesh—weeds the Holy Spirit uproots so that His fruit may flourish. What opposes kindness in your heart? You might say meanness, but it’s not that simple. Because kindness is so relational, the opposing weeds to the fruit of kindness are not meanness, but disconnection and ambivalence. Kindness grows in the place of not caring.\n\nCan you see the gospel in the Holy Spirit’s promise to grow kindness in us? The Spirit desires to move us from ambivalence toward others to a kindness that leads to peace. This begins with our relationship with God. Because of His kindness toward us in Christ, we can know we are at peace with Him, and live in the confidence of that peace. Because “when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us” from our sin and ourselves (Titus 3:4–5). This freedom enables us to engage our hearts with others—to live relationally connected lives. Rather than being disconnected and ambivalent, we become vessels through which His kindness flows to others.\n\nKindness is the art of seeing people as they really are, esteeming their worth as God does, and seeking to love them in ways that build up and nurture peace. And this is exactly what the Lord has done for us in Christ.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Patience",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nAt one time or another, you have probably heard someone say, “Patience is a virtue.” Have you ever wondered why we need that reminder? I don’t recall ever needing to be convinced that love is a virtue—or joy or peace or any other facet of the fruit of the Spirit. Yet, somewhere along the way, we needed to be persuaded that patience was something we should seek to cultivate in ourselves. Why is that?\n\nFor starters, patience doesn’t fit into our fast-paced society. Our culture demands quick results. Delayed gratification means there has been a breakdown that needs fixing. When we’re out to eat, and we grow frustrated that several minutes have passed since our empty cup was refilled, notice how we diagnose the problem: The waiter is inattentive. The restaurant is too crowded. The manager needs more staff. For most of us, cultivating a patient spirit never comes into view—it’s not our natural response. Yet, the Preacher is right when he says, “A patient spirit is better than a proud spirit” (Ecclesiastes 7:8).\n\nPatience is not our natural response, because it is the fruit of the Spirit. The ability to endure hardship with an even mind is one that must be sown in our hearts by our Creator, who knows what it means to be patient. Though He had every right to do so in His dealings with Israel, the Lord never said, “I don’t have time for this.” Though they hurled at Him the insults of idolatry, violence, and faithlessness, the biblical authors describe God as one waiting patiently to show them mercy and compassion (Isaiah 30:18; 2Peter 3:9). Look no further than Christ enduring the cross on our behalf to find the epitome of the Lord’s patience. Patience may not be our natural response to hardship, but it is in the DNA of our God. Who better then to be the one to cultivate this virtue in our hearts?\n\nThere will always be problems in our lives that cannot be quickly solved, prolonged hardships that give birth to sorrow. In the Christian faith, patience has long been understood as a form of protection in these seasons of life. Sorrow is a paralyzing force. It has the power to overwhelm and dominate a person’s life and make them feel like progress is impossible. Patience is our spiritual protection against despair because it helps preserve us in the midst of hardship. This is why James urges impoverished Christians who are being exploited by rich landlords to be patient (James 5:7–8). James isn’t uttering a useless platitude. He’s offering life-giving counsel: the path to joy in the midst of suffering is paved with patience.\n\nPatience may be out of vogue in our contemporary culture, but it is essential for navigating this life. It connects us to the hope that is ours in Jesus by serving as a buffer against anxiety, frustration, and despair. Most of all, it connects us to the love of our patient God, seen most clearly in Christ Jesus.\n\nWritten by Collin Ross\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nHiroo Onoda fought the Second World War for thirty-two years. Though the war ended in 1945, a few scattered enclaves of Japanese soldiers had no way to know this. Onoda was one of the last of these holdouts. Cut off from his home, constantly on guard, he battled with police and sabotaged farms at the edge of the Philippine wilderness for twenty-nine more years.\n\nOnoda’s war continued until Norio Suzuki left Japan and came after him. Suzuki joked that finding Onoda in the jungle would be like finding the Abominable Snowman—but find him he did. Still, Onoda would not surrender without orders from his superior officer. Within weeks, Japan sent Onoda’s former commander, a Major cum bookseller, to the Philippines. On March 9th, 1974, Major Taniguchi delivered the news: Japan was at peace—and had been for decades. Finally, Onoda surrendered, and the Philippines pardoned him for his actions.\n\nLike Onoda, all of us were once at war. In sin, an old cycle is at work. Strife leads to strife. We are enemies of God (Romans 5:10), enemies of our neighbor (Ephesians 2:12), and even our own nature is at war within us (Galatians 5:17; Romans 7:23). But Christ has triumphed over sin. First, through Him, we are reconciled to God. “Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). That peace is the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer.\n\nLike Onoda’s commander, the Holy Spirit comes to us in our wilderness and gives us peace. With the fruit of the Spirit, the Holy Spirit starts a new cycle. We love because God loves us. We have peace with God, so we find peace with our neighbor. “But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah. For he is our peace, who made both groups one and tore down the dividing wall of hostility” (Ephesians 2:13–14). The Holy Spirit leads us and bears fruit in our life, so we do not gratify our sinful nature (Galatians 5:16), and by the Spirit, we are able to have peace with ourselves.\n\nIn that way, we are different from Onoda. His commander brought news that peace had come through defeat. His war was lost. The Holy Spirit comes to us to tell us that our war is won. The peace of the Holy Spirit is the peace of Christ’s triumph, not over us, but over our enemies of sin and death. We are not defeated; instead, the Holy Spirit gives us a conqueror’s share in Christ’s victory and peace. Peace between us and God. Peace inside for the believer. Peace within the Church. Peace for the nations. We do not stand guard any longer but surrender to the Holy Spirit as the guardian of our hearts. And because of Christ Jesus, the peace of God, “which transcends all understanding,” continues to guard our hearts and minds, granting us His perfect peace (Philippians 4:7).\n\nWritten by David Chaniott\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhat brings you joy? Is it cooler weather and football season? Is it getting a bonus at work? Is it playing music in front of an adoring crowd? Do you love sitting in silence with your morning coffee? Is it binge-watching your television favorite shows online? Details aside, we’ve all had glimpses of what it’s like when everything seems right with the world. These are life’s little “sweet spots.”\n\nHowever, there are times when our seasons of contentment are interrupted or even completely eliminated. What then? We all know the script: feeling happy isn’t the same as experiencing the true joy that only comes from the Lord. But isn’t it true that we often feel out of touch with that deep joy we’ve heard about in sermons? That abiding joy we sing about on Sunday mornings and read about in Scripture? Why is it so hard to keep that joy in our hearts?\n\nI’m willing to bet I’m not the only Christ-follower who wants to plant his feet on the firm foundation of that “inexpressible and glorious joy” that comes with knowing and loving Jesus (1 Peter 1:8), but when it comes down to it, moments of disappointment and deprivation find us feeling bereft of joy. Too often, our circumstances dictate the disposition of our hearts.\n\nThis is precisely when we must remember that joy is not something we can manufacture, nor is it something our daily experiences can sustainably provide. The joy of the Spirit is something God cultivates in us—a fruit we get to enjoy by the hand of the Master Gardener.\n\nJoy of the ineffable, unshakeable variety is one of the heavenly attributes that grows within us when our hearts make a home for the Holy Spirit. When Paul writes, “Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you believe so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit” (Romans 15:13), we take note that joy begets hope. And what does hope do? Hope gets us out of bed in the morning. Hope reminds us of the truth so we can press on. Hope drives us back to Scripture where we find the encouragement to keep running into the arms of Jesus, whence that deep abiding joy derives.\n\nThe next time one of your “sweet spots” is interrupted or removed, run to Jesus with a needy heart. Humble yourself under the hand of God and ask the Holy Spirit to bear fruit in you. Remember that He is your portion and that the beautiful inheritance He has promised is irrevocably yours in Jesus. Then, even in the darkest of times, His joy will make your heart glad, your whole being rejoice, and even your body rest securely (Psalm 16:9).\n\nJust as it takes daily work to tend a garden, so must we cultivate a daily habit of humbly returning to our God. When our heart, mind, and will are attuned to His, He grows and shares His perfect joy and peace with us.\n\nWritten by Alex Florez\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Love",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nIt’s striking that love is listed first when describing the fruit of the Spirit, because as it’s portrayed and understood in Western culture, love has little to do with the Holy Spirit. Cultural “love” is sentimental or romantic, primarily a feeling. It is mysterious and fickle, capturing some people and leaving others stranded. It sweeps some people away then dashes them against the rocks. It is a good thing, definitely, but also something easy to resent when others have it and you don’t. This is not at all what the Bible tells us about love, nothing like the fruit of the Holy Spirit’s transforming work.\n\nScripture tells us, “God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him” (1John 4:16). This does not mean God is only love without other defining traits, or that love is God, as if it is a thing to be worshiped of its own accord. Rather, it means that God is the originator of love and all characteristics of true love are characteristics of God. Real love stems from God because “He has given us of his Spirit” (1John 4:13).\n\nThe best way to understand this real love is to see what God says about it. In Deuteronomy, Moses is speaking to Israel, this newly formed and chosen people of God freshly rescued out of slavery, and he tells them this about their rescuer:\n\n“[God] will not leave you, destroy you,\n\nor forget the covenant with your ancestors that he swore to them by oath,\n\nbecause the LORD your God is a compassionate God….\n\nBecause he loved your ancestors,\n\nhe chose their descendants after them” (Deuteronomy 4:31,37).\n\nGod’s love, unlike any earthly notion of love, is defined by commitment. He is a covenant-keeping God, a promise keeper, an unfailing presence to those He loves.\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 13, the apostle Paul lays out what love is and why it matters so much to all believers. He begins by listing a bunch of great things, other gifts of the Holy Spirit—tongues, eloquence, prophecy, knowledge, understanding, faith—but then says each of these is nothing without love. Love is what makes those things matter. Then Paul describes what love looks like; it’s patient, kind, not envious or boastful, not arrogant or rude or selfish. Instead, it rejoices in truth, hoping and believing the best, it remains despite circumstances (vv.4–7). To be loving is to embody all the Spirit’s work in your life—it isn’t a separate characteristic.\n\nPaul closes his description with this sentence: “Love never ends” (1Corinthians 13:8). This is no mere feeling or sentiment. “Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins…. We love because he first loved us” (1John 4:10,19). Love, as the world knows it, is a sweet feeling while it lasts, but it can’t be counted on. Love, as God offers it, never ends because it stems from His eternal, unfailing, perfect heart, through the work of His Son and the Holy Spirit for all who believe. It is the means of our salvation, our growth as Christians, and it is the visible evidence that we are in Christ.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod gives us the fruit of the Spirit because He loves us. In many ways, it’s that simple. The fruit is a promised result of walking in step with the Spirit. But what is this fruit? How does it grow? Allow me to offer five observations about the fruit of the Spirit as we begin this reading plan.\n\nFirst, what’s the metaphor? These qualities listed as the collective fruit of the Spirit have a tangibility to them. I like to think of the fruit of the Spirit like a cluster of grapes. They grow as one fruit, drawing nutrients from the same source, and yet they are distinct.\n\nSecond, when do they grow? Like all fruit, the fruit of the Spirit grows slowly and seasonally. Anyone who promises Christian maturity overnight is selling something you don’t need. The psalmist says that the one who follows the Lord “is like a tree planted beside flowing streams” of water “that bears its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers” (Psalm 1:3). Real change is usually gradual. We don’t always see this growth, but we can see the evidence of it.\n\nThird, spiritual growth is inevitable for those who are in Christ. If you have the Spirit, you will grow. Of course, we can, and often do, hinder the Spirit’s work in us. But the promise is that because God is calling us to walk in step with His Spirit (Galatians 5:25), and because the Holy Spirit dwells in those who trust in Christ, His Spirit is actively growing His people according to His perfect will.\n\nFourth, spiritual growth is comprehensive. It touches every aspect of your life, and the fruit of the Spirit—“love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control” (Galatians 5:22–23)—spans the whole of the human experience.\n\nFifth, all aspects of the fruit of the Spirit are interdependent on one another. They are linked together and thus grow together. You are not going to grow in your patience without also growing in your self-control. You are not going to deepen in your sense of peace without also deepening in your faithfulness and gentleness toward others. These are all rooted in the first aspect of this fruit: love. And they are all grown in grace. So we can know that the Spirit’s desire is not merely to grow one aspect, but to grow in us as one, collective fruit.\n\nThe fruit of the Spirit is not a set of qualities to achieve on our own and then present to the Lord for His approval. It is the Spirit’s work in us—the evidence of His sanctifying grace at work in our lives. We tend the vine, but the Lord makes the fruit grow.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

There, I said it.\n\nThough some misguided souls have taken this sentiment as a license to sin without fear of repercussion, and though some have found it distasteful to presume upon the Lord for such long-suffering without us kicking in at least a little merit, I defy you to find one single verse in the Bible that says a person can sin their way out of God’s grip of grace.\n\nOf course people can claim a faith that isn’t genuine, but if Jesus has redeemed a soul, not even the vilest demons of hell can reclaim it. In Christ, our place in God’s presence is secure. We cannot be separated from His love.\n\nLook at how clearly Jesus says this in John 6:37–39. He says all that the Father gives to Him will come to Him, and He will never cast them out. He won’t lose anyone; He’ll raise them all up on the last day. As Paul wrote to the believers in Rome, “Whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord” (Romans 14:8).\n\nChances are there’s at least some part of you that wants to object to the “once saved, always saved” idea. Maybe it’s the presumptive way that phrase can be used to cheapen grace. That’s fair. We mustn’t ever cheapen grace. But often the objection is in response to the extravagance of the claim. It’s too good. How could it possibly be true?\n\nTHAT question right there—How could it possibly be true that our place in God’s presence is secure?—is one of the best questions you could ever ask, because it is not a rhetorical question, but rather a question with an answer. And it’s a glorious answer.\n\nConsider everything we’ve read in this four-week study. Consider God’s purpose in making us for His presence, and how we broke that relationship through sin. Think of the devastation of the fall of humanity, and all the brokenness that entered the world as a result. Think of our utter inability to reconcile ourselves to God. Think of the incarnation of Jesus—God come in the flesh for the purpose of living and dying in our place and defeating the power of death. Think of the war between good and evil waged on our behalf. Think of the way the angels sang in triumphant chorus at the birth of Jesus, and how they sing in Revelation that He alone is worthy of all blessing and honor and glory. Think of how we, the Church, are called His beloved Bride, which He adorns with splendor and makes radiant.\n\nWhat could you possibly do to undo all of that?\n\nThere is nothing cheap about believing that our salvation is secure because it is not our performance that makes it so. The work of Christ makes it so. What cheapens grace is suggesting we have it in ourselves to overrule the gracious purposes of God and thwart the resurrection power of Jesus through our conduct.\n\nThe good news of the gospel is that you were made for an intimate relationship with your Creator, and because of the finished work of Christ on behalf of all who believe, you will have that relationship for all eternity. To Him be the glory.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod is always present with believers always through the Holy Spirit.\n\nMy freshman year of college was characterized by a tumultuous relationship with a dear friend. It all came to a head in the spring when Susie and I set a time to meet and decide whether or not we should remain “just friends” or try dating. Friends since middle school, we were set to meet on a Wednesday night to define our relationship moving forward. From the time class was over that Wednesday until the time we were set to meet, I fasted and prayed—about five hours in all. I had never felt as close to God as I did then. Up until that point, I’d never in my life been more aware of the Holy Spirit ministering to me. The truth of “God with us” in the Holy Spirit became real in my life that day.\n\nWhen Jesus Christ was preparing to leave His disciples on earth following the resurrection, He commissioned them to go, make disciples of all nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:18–19). Immediately following this Great Commission, Jesus bestowed on them this comforting truth: “Remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age” (v.20).\n\nJesus is with us not in His physical, embodied presence as He was in the incarnation, ministering with His disciples around Israel. He is with us in the person of the Holy Spirit. When Jesus left this earth and joined His Father in heaven, He sent the Holy Spirit as a Counselor and guide, and a promise that He will return again. In Ephesians 1:13–14, Paul writes:\n\nIn him you also were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit \n\nwhen you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and when you believed. \n\nThe Holy Spirit is the down payment of our inheritance, \n\nuntil the redemption of the possession, to the praise of his glory.\n\nGod is always with us in the presence of the Holy Spirit. Whether we’re fretting about whether or not to take that new job, dreading a difficult conversation with a loved one, or facing the greatest pangs of temptation we’ve ever faced, the Holy Spirit, our helper, is with us, reminding us of what is true. The Holy Spirit points us to the source of our hope. The Holy Spirit reminds us that no failure we commit is beyond the bounds of God’s grace. The Holy Spirit helps us pray when we don’t know what to pray (Romans 8:26).\n\nSusie and I started dating and eventually got married. But I remember very little of the conversation we had that Wednesday night in May 2009. What I remember most is that, before the conversation, the Holy Spirit reminded me that my joy and contentment are to be rooted in the Lord, and that nothing that would ever happen to me could make that untrue.\n\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Walking in God’s Presence",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nWe are called to follow Jesus and walk with Him daily, learning about life in His kingdom.\n\nWe sometimes mistakenly think that those who lived in Jesus’s day had an easier time leaving behind everything they had known to follow Him. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, we see just how much the disciples left behind to follow the Savior. In Matthew 4:18–24, Jesus calls two sets of brothers, all of whom were professional fishermen. Back in that day, this also meant they were businessmen, and the Gospel records imply that James and John were heirs to a lucrative family fishing business.\n\nWhat was it that enabled these men—and the multitude of other disciples to leave such things as family members, jobs, and social statuses—to “immediately” leave their nets, their former way of life, and follow Christ? (Matthew 4:20). Maybe it was because they recognized the divine presence in the one who was calling them. The same call God had issued to Abraham so long ago, He also issued to men and women in the days of His incarnation.\n\nAs a young Christian, Michael Card’s song “Things We Leave Behind” left a deep impact on me, particularly found these opening verses:\n\nThere sits Simon, so foolishly wise;\n\nProudly he’s tending his nets\n\nThen Jesus calls and the boats drift away\n\nAll that he owns he forgets.\n\nBut more than the nets he abandoned that day,\n\nHe found that his pride was soon drifting away.\n\nAnd it’s hard to imagine the freedom we find\n\nFrom the things we leave behind.\n\nThere is an analogy to be drawn between Peter abandoning his fishing nets and his leaving behind other aspects of his life when he came to follow Christ. In leaving their nets, these men were leaving their former way of life and learning to walk in the presence of God.\n\nOf course, the disciples’ lives were being shaped as they walked in Jesus’s presence. They were learning more of the glory, wisdom, grace, power, truth, justice, and compassion of God, as they followed Him throughout the promised land. They were listening intently to His teaching, His parables, His warnings, and His promises. They were seeing His miracles. They were willing to walk with Him to the point of His suffering on the cross for their sins. It was this last act of the Savior on earth that they particularly needed to embrace if they were going to be His disciples. He had come to suffer for their sins and for the sins of His people throughout the world.\n\nIf we are to walk in the presence of God, we, too, are called to follow Christ. This may mean leaving family members, jobs, societal comforts, and even our own expectations. In whatever form it may take, of this much we can be sure: as we leave behind things that keep us from the Savior, we will discover that we gain more than we ever leave behind. As we walk in the presence of God, we will find a joy that we belong to Him, that He has died for us, and that He is conforming us into His glorious image.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod calls His people to take part in establishing His kingdom on earth, and His presence secures our victory.\n\nSean White clipped into his snowboard for his second run in the Vancouver Winter Olympics half-pipe. Before he plunged downhill, he perched at the starting line and raised both hands in triumph. He had already won the gold medal. Olympic half-pipers run twice and keep their best score. Sean’s first score topped all the other snowboarders’ first and second runs. He could have scooted down the half-pipe on his belly like an otter and taken the gold medal. This second run was a victory lap.\n\nEvery day, God’s people are perched on the same line. God calls His people to take part in establishing His promised kingdom on earth. Before any sermon is preached, before any gift is given, before any disciple is made, or prayer offered, God’s presence secures victory for His Church. The medal is already His.\n\nThat does not mean every day will feel like a victory lap. The book of Joshua begins with the Israelites perched on the Jordan River, ready to cross over into the promised land. They faced a long struggle against their enemies. God also gave them the high bar of His law to follow, which they would fail to reach again and again. God still assured them, “Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go” (Joshua 1:9). The Israelites took those first steps into the promised land on that alone, hoping that God would be with them as He had been with Moses. Again and again, God demonstrated His presence in dramatic miracles. The Jordan parted, the walls of Jericho fell, the sun stood still, and even more was still to come in Christ.\n\nIn Romans, Paul talks about the sufferings Christians face. It is not a rosy list. Death, famine, persecution, and violence are only the highlights. Against these things, Paul weighs the love of Christ and asks, “If God is for us, who is against us?” (Romans 8:31). Since God has not even spared His own Son, then nothing can stand against His love. Christ has justified us and unites us with God, and now nothing can separate us from that love.\n\nWhen you face the day, know that God’s words to you are true. He is with you. When God tells you “I will not leave you or forsake you” (Joshua 1:5), He is telling you the score. The victory is already secure. Nothing you do and nothing that happens will separate you from His love in Christ. His kingdom has already won, even when we can only hope for it. Knowing this gives you the freedom to act, confident of the outcome, like Sean White in the Olympics. Afterall, his second half-pipe score—that “victory lap” run—is still the highest score in the history of the sport.\n\nWritten by Dave Chaniott\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nFrom the call of Abram to our inclusion as spiritual descendants, God’s promises to His people are marked by His presence.\n\nAs I write this, most states are out of focused quarantine. Over the last several months, we’ve been absent from one another physically, or had the presence of our faces covered by masks. I have no idea what the coming months will hold.\n\nWhatever your current circumstances, consider with me now what it’s like to miss someone’s presence. These months of social distancing remind me of what our relationship with Christ is like. As long as we are home in our bodies, we’re away from His bodily presence (2Corinthians 4:6–8; 5:8). Because Jesus has ascended to heaven, we can only see Him through the eyes of faith. In fact, the whole Christian life is characterized by faith like that of Abraham and his descendants: a faith that longs for, waits for, and looks forward to what we can’t see right now. For now, we only see Christ through a glass darkly, as if we’re chatting through a Zoom call, but one day we’ll see Him face to face (1Corinthians 13:12).\n\nAnd yet, even though Christ’s presence is mediated now by the Spirit, we can still experience His presence daily. From the call of Abram (Genesis 12) to our inclusion as Christ’s spiritual descendants (Acts 3:25), God’s promises to His people have been marked by His presence. God’s presence with us through His Word and Spirit confirms His covenant commitment to us (Genesis 12:2–3; 17:2,4; 26:3–4). His presence with us also reveals our identity as His children (Genesis 12:7; 17:5,7; 26:24; 28:13). Our Savior says to us as He did to Isaac, “Do not be afraid. I am with you” (Genesis 26:24, emphasis mine). He comforts us as He did Jacob: “Look, I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go… I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you” (Genesis 28:15, emphasis mine).\n\nChrist is a faithful friend, so His presence doesn’t flatter. At times, His presence may not feel like comfort; sometimes it will feel as though we’re wrestling with Him, and sometimes we may feel wounded (see Genesis 32:22–32). We may see God’s face and yet be spared (v.30), but one thing is for certain: we cannot experience His presence and stay the same. When we share a rich personal connection with God, we emerge changed.\n\nSo as I think about how I’ve missed and longed for the presence of my friends, I’m giving thanks for the presence of my God. May our days be marked by His present guidance and a longing to see His gracious and transforming face.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nOne day, in the new heavens and new earth, God will dwell with His people as He did in the beginning.\n\nNot too long ago, I was showing my neighbor the firepit I built in my backyard. Around the firepit, I placed large patio stones in a circular pattern and planted grass in between them, along with five Adirondack chairs. When showing my neighbor the fruit of my labor I remarked, “This is my sanctuary,” and in many ways it is. I often end my day spending time there. In fact, many nights I sit there quietly in prayer, simply dwelling in the presence of God.\n\nNow, my backyard is a far cry from what it must have been like in the garden of Eden. However, it often stirs my biblical imagination of what it must have been like to walk in the physical presence of God in the cool of the day (Genesis 3:8). Built into the very fabric of humanity is a desire to experience the presence of God. In fact, the story of Scripture begins and ends with the presence of God.\n\nIn the book of Genesis, Eden is the first human’s home but, more importantly, it is also God’s garden temple. A sacred space where the Creator God and His image-bearers dwell together. However, when sin entered the world, Adam and Eve (along with all of humanity) were cast out of God’s holy presence. Paradise was lost. Even more, the initial command to build out the earth as the city of God was left unfulfilled. Heaven and earth were separated. The world we dwell in now is broken, and longing for redemption. The people of the earth drift around, looking for anything that will fill the gaping hole that can only be filled with God’s presence.\n\nThe apostle John speaks directly to this when Jesus is introduced in his Gospel account as coming to dwell among us. What a breathtaking reality. Jesus, the God-man had come and walked among us. His message was that the kingdom of God had come near (Mark 1:15). In other words, what Adam and Eve failed to do, Jesus came to make right. Jesus lived the perfect life according to God’s holy standards, something none of us could do. Jesus died a sacrificial death for us, in our place, so that we could be granted access to the presence of God again.\n\nAt the end of the Bible, in the book of Revelation, John speaks again of a day when Jesus will come again and bring heaven and earth back together, depicting a time when paradise will be regained. What a marvelous promise to be able to one day say with John, “Look, God’s dwelling is with humanity, and he will live with them” (Revelation 21:3).\n\nAs I write this, I am sitting in my backyard “sanctuary,” and it’s a pale shadow of the garden city that we will dwell in one day for all of eternity. Even as I sit here quietly in prayer, reflecting on the presence of God, I cannot imagine what it will be like to see my God face to face. In a few hours, the fire before me will disappear into the darkness. But one day, the darkness will disappear in the light of His glory forevermore. On that day, our life in the garden city with God will never end.\n\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nThe people of God are the temple of God; His presence is active in the Church.\n\n“I miss my church.”\n\nThat’s the common refrain I heard from my friends when congregations weren’t meeting in person because of COVID-19. Most of the folks I heard say this attended churches that offered some type of online service, so when they said, “I miss my church,” they weren’t talking about the music or the preaching. When I probed a little deeper, their meaning was clear: they missed the people. They longed to see their church family face to face again.\n\nThe apostle Paul stressed the mysterious unity we enjoy in Christ in 1 Corinthians 3. The Corinthian church was facing an issue that is not unfamiliar to us; the church found itself divided over different teachers. One person would say that he followed Paul, while another claimed to follow Peter, and yet another devoted himself to Apollos. Then, the brother who desired to correct everyone would step in and proclaim, “Well, I follow Christ.”\n\nThese divisions fractured the unity of the Body of Christ, so Paul reminded them of their corporate identity. He asked, “Don’t you yourselves know that you are God’s temple and that the Spirit of God lives in you?” (1Corinthians 3:16). Paul used the language of the temple, which would have been familiar to those who were steeped in the scriptures. As we’ve read over the last two weeks, in the Old Testament, the presence of God dwelt in the temple and people who wanted to meet with God had to go there. But even then, only the high priest could enter the most holy place.\n\nThen we read about how when Jesus came, He used temple language to talk about Himself. In John 2, when He turned over tables in the temple, Jesus told the crowd, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days” (v.19). The crowd seemed confused by His words and mocked Him, but John explains that “he was speaking about the temple of his body” (v.21). Jesus is the new temple. Now we enter the presence of God not in a building, but through faith in Him.\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 3:16, Paul extended this metaphor: God’s people have been filled with the Holy Spirit and now the presence of God is in us and active among us. This is especially true when the Church is together. using our gifts to serve each other, which demonstrates that the Spirit is among us.\n\nThe people of God are a reminder of God’s presence. We’re reminded of His presence by the encouragers, the ones who the Spirit uses to lift us up when we are down. He works through those with the gift of hospitality, those who warmly welcome us and care for us, reminding us that God has welcomed us into His forever family. He works through our friends with the gift of mercy, because their presence with us during difficult times is a tangible reminder of God’s steadfast presence. We need the Church because it reminds us that God loves us completely, that He is always with us, and that He is always for us.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nOn the day of Pentecost, God’s presence was poured out on believers.\n\nIn high school, late summer in the Piedmont of North Carolina was the convergence of two realities for me: a humid heat that seemingly made every fiber of the universe stick to my sweaty skin, and the torture of three-a-day football practices in the previously mentioned heat. The pre-season physical conditioning was enough to double a man over, but the heat that came with it made the practices unbearable. That is, until about 3 o’clock in the afternoon. Mysteriously (at least to our experience), each afternoon brought a rumbling thunder from the West, accompanied by the coolest, most refreshing downpour of rain that ended up curtailing the humidity, heat, and weariness of our lengthy practices. With the first echo of thunder, you’d see a group of thirty or so football players in full gear run out into the middle of the field to be embraced by the drenching water that would soon fall.\n\nI imagine the writers of the scriptures envisioned the sending of the Holy Spirit similarly. The land is dry (Isaiah 44:3); the people are parched and barren. But something powerful occurs when the Spirit of God is sent among His people. Refreshment comes and blessing abounds. Justice, righteousness, security, and peace flourish. A powerful refreshment of Spirit-given life is bestowed upon the entire world.\n\nWhen we consider our lives today, and the nature of the world around us, we long for the refreshment of the Spirit of God upon us. The good life that we desire is not some pipe dream that elusively sits outside of our grasp. Nor is it a purchased and earned experience that is the result of our abundant faith, our good intentions, or even our best deeds.\n\nNo, the refreshment and life-giving sending of the Holy Spirit is the grace of God’s smile upon us (Ezekiel 39:29). The sending of the Holy Spirit to indwell every follower of Jesus is God turning His face of love toward His people. God brings His refreshment, blessing, and peace upon us through the Holy Spirit.\n\nYou might wonder how and when can you get the refreshment of the Holy Spirit. When might this “downpour” come upon our lives? Scripture tells us that following the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, the promises of God were fulfilled in the sending of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2). What the prophet Joel had envisioned as the refreshment of God that waters dry and weary hearts (Joel 2:28) occurred that day as Peter preached Jesus as Lord.\n\nYou haven’t missed out on the refreshing downpour of the Spirit of God in your life. Joel’s prophecy is for “all humanity,” and as Peter proclaimed in Acts 2, “The promise is for you and for your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call” (Acts 2:39). Like my football buddies standing in the middle of the rain, today we can enjoy the pouring out of the Spirit of God upon us by faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n",

For me, one of those moments happened when I was 24 years old, standing at the top of the French Alps, overlooking the seemingly endless miles of mountains. I’d never seen such a glorious sight in my life.\n\nThis is as close as I’ve come to imagining the disciples’ experience of certain events that occurred during their time with Christ—events that likely left an indelible mark on their minds and hearts. The transfiguration was such an experience for Peter, James, and John. Reflecting back on his witness to the ministry of Jesus, the apostle John wrote, “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). John was astonished by what he’d witnessed on the Mount of Transfiguration.\n\nIn the Old Testament, the tabernacle was the dwelling place of God. Just as God’s people lived in tents, so God came to dwell with them in a tent. The tent dwelling of God in the tabernacle was a type of God’s ultimate dwelling with His people in the tabernacle of the flesh of Christ. Since God’s children partook of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise partook of flesh and blood. In Jesus, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily. This is the reason why Jesus could speak of His body as the temple that would be destroyed and raised back up in three days (John 2:19).\n\nThe temple was a more permanent dwelling place for God than the tabernacle had been, though it, too, was ultimately temporary. God had planned a greater and more intimate dwelling place. God planned on coming in the flesh. When Jesus disputed with the religious leaders in Israel, He bore witness to the fact that “something greater than the temple” had come (Matthew 12:6). He who filled the heavens and the earth—who could not be contained by a building—united a human nature to His divine nature, thereby becoming God and man in one person forever.\n\nBy entering into the world in the person of Jesus, God came to reestablish His presence with His people. Christ is greater than the tabernacle and temple. Because God dwelt fully in the Person of Christ, believers will dwell in His presence forever. By faith in Christ, we have direct access into the very presence of God.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n",

    "devo_title": "God’s Presence Leaves the Temple",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhen God’s people turned away from Him, He removed His presence from the temple.\n\nFrom the very beginning of Scripture, God is a covenant maker—with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and on and on. God established a people for Himself based on this repeated covenant: “I will be your God and you will be my people” (Jeremiah 7:23). He formed them as a nation, gave them a home, then had them build a temple that would become His house among them, where He dwelt with them and His glory was manifest.\n\nWe must remember the full covenant promise. God told His people that He would bless them and be with them if they kept His commands and pursued no other gods, and He warned them of judgment and consequence if they abandoned His ways. In Jeremiah 7 we see this proclaimed clearly when He calls on the people to execute justice, to not oppress the vulnerable, to not shed innocent blood, and to not seek after other gods (vv.5–7). If they do this, He tells them, they will be free to live in the land and He will dwell there with them. The passage goes on to describe how God’s people have believed deceptive words and persisted in their sin to the point that God asks them:\n\n“Has this house, which bears my name, \n\nbecome a den of robbers in your view? \n\nYes, I too have seen it” (v.11).\n\nThe Israelites had so departed from God that even His holy temple had become marked by their selfishness and thievery. And this was not God’s only Fatherly warning to His people. In verses 23–25 God recounts how, through the nation’s leaders and prophets, He has been summoning and calling them to obedience since they were freed from Egypt.“Yet they didn’t listen or pay attention but followed their own advice and their own stubborn, evil heart. They went backward and not forward” (v.24).\n\nSo God kept His promise. He departed the temple. He “cast the people out of His sight” and “plucked them up” from the land He had given them and from His house, the temple (2Chronicles 7:19–21). Ezekiel 10 paints a powerful picture of God’s departure as a whirling, mysterious, magnificent cloud that filled the temple court with brightness before going “out from the threshold of the temple… and it stopped at the entrance to the eastern gate of the LORD’s house” (vv.4,18–19).\n\nThere is a seeming hopelessness in those words. It is especially grim when we realize that we are so like the people of Israel—prone to stubborn rebellion against God. But remember who else used the words from Jeremiah 7 and called the temple a “den of robbers”: Jesus, God Himself, when driving out the money changers in Matthew 21:13. It is in Jesus that our hope lies, the very presence of God sent to dwell among us.\n\nGod promised this very thing in the book of Haggai, declaring, “Once more, in a little while… I will fill this house with glory…. The final glory of this house will be greater than the first… I will provide peace in this place” (vv.6,7,9). God, the covenant maker, does not abandon His covenant or His people. He took His presence from the people as judgment, but always with the intent to restore His presence to His people, and to us, through the life and work of Jesus Christ.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod’s presence filled the temple, and His people drew near and worshiped Him.\n\nPicture this: Solomon and the elders of Israel escort the ark of the covenant into the temple. There are people everywhere. The priests then take over and take the ark into the Holy Place, the inner sanctum. And then when they withdraw, a cloud appears and it is so overwhelming that the “ the priests were not able to continue ministering, for the glory of the Lord filled the temple” (1Kings 8:11).\n\nCan you imagine? Everyone is gathered and there is an expectation of the priests immediately beginning their work. But things don’t go according to plan, because the glory of the Lord fills the temple in what we’re told looks like a cloud. The temple was a constant reminder of God’s glory and presence. Picture it: Maybe you’re traveling down the road into the city of Jerusalem when you look up to see the temple dominating the cityscape, and you think to yourself, Yahweh is with us here.\n\nI don’t know about you, but this passage makes me think a lot about Jesus. I think about how He referred to Himself, saying, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up again in three days” (John 2:19). I remember how Philip asked Jesus to show them the Father, and Jesus responded boldly, telling them that anyone who has laid eyes on Him has also seen the Father (John 14:9). In John 17, He goes on to pray what is known as the High Priestly Prayer, starting with: “Now, Father, glorify me in your presence with that glory I had with you before the world existed” (v.5). When we look at the living, breathing person of Jesus, who walked the dusty roads of Jerusalem, Bethany, Capernaum, and more as detailed throughout the Gospels, we are also seeing the glory of God.\n\nJesus is the glory of God on full display in flesh and blood. We see the glory of His wisdom in how to navigate this world as a human. We see the glory of His kindness to the marginalized. We see the fullness of His glory in His love for sinners as He dies in their place on the cross. And we see the fullness of His glory in the King conquering sin and death and making us citizens of His eternal kingdom of love and joy and peace.\n\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod provided a place for His people to draw near to Him.\n\nGod’s dwelling with His people has been the plan from the very beginning. This is the story of Scripture, from the first page to the last, from the garden to an eternal garden city where we will finally dwell with our God and see Him face to face (1John 3:2). Sadly, this union was hindered by sin’s entrance into the garden. Even still, the faithlessness and rebellion of those He has created cannot nullify the faithfulness and grace of their Creator. Following God’s unfolding plan to restore His dwelling place among His people is essential to understanding the tabernacle.\n\nReaching back almost 3500 years into history, we discover a significant move of the God of Israel to re-establish a physical dwelling place to be with His people. This portable, earthly tent was used by the Israelites between their exodus from Egypt and the conquest of Canaan. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had not forgotten His people, and so He once again came to meet with what at the time was a small tribe of recently freed slaves wandering in the desert. Their faithlessness and idolatry did not prevent Him from remembering His covenant and providing a way for His people to dwell with Him. He instructs Moses, “They are to make a sanctuary for me so that I may dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8).\n\nThrough the sacrificial laws that would be fulfilled inside its walls, God more fully revealed to them the nature of their rebellion and need for atonement. Through each rich detail, God’s people would have been reminded of the garden, the paradise where humanity once dwelled with their Creator God, their true King. The entrance to the holy of holies, the ark of the covenant and the altar, the colors, shapes, materials, smells, and even the priest and his garments—everything pointed to their God.\n\nIn the days and weeks to come, we’ll read how this place for God’s presence transitioned in time to the temple in Jerusalem, and then most broadly to His presence among His people from every tribe, tongue, and nation, and by the Holy Spirit through their union with Christ. At each stage in this grand, unfolding, redemptive plan, God has not stopped pursuing His people, continuing to make a way to dwell with them.\n\nThroughout our lives we are likely to experience diverse seasons. At some points we may sense a garden’s lushness and at others times the confusion and barrenness of the desert. Regardless of what season we find ourselves in, we must remember that our God has never been satisfied for us to remain in lonely isolation, separated from Him and in a perpetually broken relationship. When we reflect back on the narrative of Scripture to read about the tabernacle, what we’re really being reminded of is that God has always longed to restore His people to Himself, so that we might dwell with Him forever. Through Christ, the work of the tabernacle has been completed, bringing us back to a place of unity and peace with our God and one another. We now wait longingly for His return, when we will dwell with Him in perfect harmony.\n\nWritten by Robert Wheeler\n\n",

    "devo_title": "God’s Presence Transforms His People",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nLike Moses’s face made radiant by standing in God’s presence on Mt. Sinai, God’s people are transformed by life in His presence.\n\nWe long for transformation. We long to change ourselves into happier selves, our homes and communities into better places of peace and cohesion, and our nation into a place of greater love and optimism.\n\nWe are also stumped in our attempts to achieve transformation. The hopes of yesterday are undone by the troubles of today. We look for solutions in self-empowerment, blaming others and blaming circumstances. We look for help from within, from friends and authorities driven by a kind of strong-arm mentality: If we can only push our ideas through, get our opinions out there, rally others to our program—then things could really be different. But our solutions don’t solve the problems.\n\nThe gospel offers a radically different answer. It doesn’t sit easy with us, largely because it has so little to do with our abilities and efforts. We want to do something, to fix things fast. But the gospel message of salvation begins and ends, not with our work, but God’s. Our position is shockingly and uncomfortably passive.\n\nGod declared to Moses: “I am coming to you.” Not the other way around. He also comes to Moses “in a dense cloud” (Exodus 19:9). This, too, is unsettling. We’d like Him to appear with a clear program; preferably, it should be obvious and efficient. In other words, we want it to look exactly like our plan. Why are His ways so shrouded in mystery?\n\nPart of the answer is that He comes “so that the people will hear” when He speaks (Exodus 19:9). There is to be no confusion about whose kingdom we are dealing with. God has not come to fulfill our plans, but to show us His plan. We are called to listen and obey.\n\nAnd we’re called to hear and receive with faith. God tells Moses He’s come so that the people will hear “and will always believe [Moses]” and the messages God speaks through him (v.9). God calls us to pay heed to His ministers; Abraham, Moses, Elijah, and the rest of the prophets have voiced God’s plan for transformation through the ages. Do we truly desire change? Do we long for a different world? Do we long for the coming kingdom? Then hear and obey the Word of the Lord.\n\nToday, the veil that covered the face of Moses has been removed, the dense cloud dispelled, and the mystery of the gospel revealed. Christ has opened access to the throne of God for you and me, and just as Moses’s face was transformed by the presence of God, so also we, “are looking as in a mirror at the glory of the Lord and are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory; this is from the Lord who is the Spirit” (2 Corinthians 3:18).\n\nIn a world that is constantly hungering for answers, we have the promise of real transformation, personally and culturally, in the presence of God. If we abide in Him, and He in us, we are made into the likeness of His eternal Son, Jesus Christ. His is the kingdom we are to seek, not our own. And with the coming of His kingdom, all these things will be added (Matthew 6:33).\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod’s presence was with Moses and with Israel as they were brought out of slavery in Egypt.\n\nAs a kid, I didn’t mind going to church. I liked the hymns and doodling in the margins of the pew hymnals. The one issue I had with the Sunday morning ritual was the dress code. For me, pressed khakis, dress shoes, and a button-down shirt were too constricting and uncomfortable. But my parents insisted that we dress up. I’ll never forget coming up with this theological argument around the age of twelve:\n\n“Hey mom,” I said. ”If God loves me unconditionally, doesn’t He still love me even if I don’t wear khakis?” I doubt I’m the only “rebellious” Christian kid to try this line of reasoning.\n\n“That’s true,” she responded. “But He also said to honor your father and mother. And I’m telling you to wear them to church.”\n\n(Maybe this is why I now attend a nondenominational church where jeans are considered acceptable attire.)\n\nGod never gets specific about church dress code in the Bible. But there are a few significant references to clothing in the scriptures. One of them shows up in the story of Moses’s interaction with a certain flambé shrubbery.\n\nIn Exodus chapter 3, Moses is watching his flocks when he sees an unusual sight. It’s hard to say how any of us would respond to a supernatural burning bush. But for his part, Moses is brave enough to investigate further. That’s when the bush speaks to him.\n\nAnd what’s one of the first things spoken to him through the bush? “Hey, can you take off your shoes? This is holy ground you’re walking on here” (Exodus 3:5, my paraphrase).\n\nThere are plenty of theories as to why Moses is asked to discalceate (a fancy word meaning “to remove shoes or footwear”) in God’s presence. My guess is that it has something to do with humility and reverence. I doubt Moses owned many pairs of shoes, so I imagine this footwear was probably precious to him. And so removing his shoes was an act of submission before the Lord. The ground probably wasn’t paved or even. So walking around in bare feet was likely uncomfortable, maybe even painful. Still, this was a small, but significant, sacrifice on Moses’s part.\n\nMoses kicks off those kicks without hesitation because he knows who’s speaking to him. He’s even (understandably) a little afraid. And it’s this submissive and willing attitude from Moses that God uses to lead His people out of slavery in Egypt.\n\nThe lesson here is that we’re sometimes called to do things for God that we don’t understand. Even if God asks us to do something small and unusual, it may be the first step to see if we’re prepared to obey something much bigger. We follow His instructions because obedience is required of us, and there is always purpose behind what He’s called us to do.\n\nWritten by Robert Carnes\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Life with God in the Garden",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod created us to live and serve in His presence, but our sin made us unfit for life in the garden.\n\nI am fascinated by the thought of life in the garden of Eden before the fall. Scripture tells us, “The LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he placed the man he had formed” (Genesis 2:8). There, humanity once lived in perfect harmony and relationship with God. What was it like to have a clear conscience, no bills to pay, no broken marriages, no dirty politicians, no pandemics, no economies to collapse? What was it like to walk with God in the garden in the cool of the day?\n\nWorship itself is a kind of simulation of returning to Eden. When we gather as the people of God in corporate worship, by the invitation of His grace to us in our Lord Jesus, we gather to walk with Him without condemnation or fear, without shame or regret, without hostility or envy, without anxiety or hopelessness. God created us to live in His presence as our first parents did before the fall—without any of those things that bring us pain.\n\nBut those things are present with us now because of sin. When Adam and Eve sinned against the Lord, they took on a sinful nature that’s been passed down to every last one of us since. The absence of one single perfect person apart from Christ Himself is evidence that this is an inherited condition. When God put Adam and Eve outside the garden, He set angels with flaming swords to guard the gate. As the late, great musician Rich Mullins said, “The Lord wasn’t joking when he kicked them out of Eden.” The image of those seraphs with burning blades had to have been a terrifying sight.\n\nThe severity of our separation from Eden was more than a separation from a place. It was a separation from a person—from God’s presence. We fractured our relationship with Him in such a way that we could not repair it. If humanity was to have any hope of ever standing within the confines of that garden again, it would be because we were not only fit for Eden, but for the presence of the Lord Himself. For that to happen, God would have to be the one to restore us. He would have to be the one to repair what we’ve broken.\n\nWhen we think about the presence of God in the lives of His people, consider the miracle of redemption. Consider the magnificence of His restoring grace at work in our lives. Apart from His grace, our sin runs so deep that we cannot stand in the presence of God, no matter how hard we may try. But with His grace, the offense that set the angels with the flaming swords at their posts is not only pardoned; the offenders are restored to the kind of peace with our Creator that assures us that we will do one better than Adam and Eve. We will not walk with God in the garden in the cool of the day. We will sit at His banquet table as His beloved Bride in His kingdom forever (Revelation 19:6–9). All of this is by, and only by, the finished work of Jesus on our behalf.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Remembering God’s Presence",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nAs we focus our hearts and minds on Him, we become more aware of our ever-present God.\n\nI’ve found that awe always comes from wonder, from the beauty of a sunset on a clear mountain day to a rainbow over the beach after a summer shower to the sights and sounds of the county fair at night… Yep, that’s right: the county fair really is a magical place. It’s a playground with a vast array of possibilities, ranging anywhere from winning a large stuffed unicorn to getting food poisoning and everything in between.\n\nAnd so it was the summer my son was ten years old. With great anticipation, we’d parked the car in a large field, ready to enter into that wonderland of awe when my son slammed his finger in the car door. Honestly, I believe for a moment he’d altogether forgotten he was even at the county fair. His vocabulary in that moment was limited to just one word: “DADDY!”\n\nI can say from experience far beyond that day that nothing takes the wonder and awe out of life faster than pain. When God urges us to draw near, He knows something we sometimes forget: Life is often painful. It can be painful because of others, but also because of our own actions and attitudes. Pain never has the power to actually change what is true, but it can change what we believe is true—and we tend to live out of what we truly believe. So when God calls us to seek His face and His strength always (1Chronicles 16:11), it’s because He also knows that in our pain and distress, we forget who we are. We need His presence and compassion—His comfort—to remind us (Deuteronomy 4:29,31).\n\nBut as for me, God’s presence is my good.\n\nI have made the Lord GOD my refuge,\n\nso I can tell about all you do (Psalm 73:28).\n\nI held my son in my arms that night and kissed his finger a thousand times, trying to assure him that he was right to cry and it was going to be okay. As the pain began to subside he caught a glimpse of the giant ferris wheel off in the distance. Amazed and with his sense of wonder restored, he asked a simple question: “Dad, will you ride that with me?”\n\nWhen God urges us to draw near to Him, He is inviting us into His comfort, and comfort has the power to heal more than just what hurt me; it can also rewrite the broken narrative pain often invites me to believe. Comfort leads me to thankfulness that I’m not alone and that the God who is with me is kind and merciful. The comfort of His presence also leads me to remember what’s true, which might be the greatest of all gifts. When we remember the greater story of the gospel that is being told in and through our lives, we are given courage to awake from our pain, to look up in wonder and be reminded of who God is, but also who we are in relation to Him: those He dearly loves and who bear His image to a watching, waiting, and broken world.\n\nWritten by Randy Draughon\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhen we remember God’s presence goes with us and before us, we can find comfort in any circumstance.\n\nTwo weeks into the summer I learned something I had never known. After a number of years working at a bank, I was overjoyed to be working as a teacher. I’d just finished my first year at a classical Christian school where I taught New Testament, systematic theology, and hermeneutics, and I’d loved every minute of it. The school was an exhilarating environment and one in which I thrived. The classroom was my sweet spot. Every day was a joy, and I was even thankful for the hard days and sometimes difficult students. But as great as it was, I was also looking forward to two months of summer.\n\nBut I couldn’t even begin to comprehend this kind of rest. Two months of family time and pool time, sleeping in, reading only what I wanted to read, and vacationing to St. Louis without coming right back to work—I couldn’t get my head around it. I’d longed for the days when I was off for the summer just like when I was a kid, but after two weeks, I realized something: this was not the rest I was looking for.\n\nSomething was missing. I could feel it in my bones and in my spirit. I needed a rest that was beyond summer days and nights and the smell of chlorine and sun on my skin. Don’t get me wrong; I still enjoyed the days off and the time spent with my three kids and my wife. I enjoyed waking up day after day without having to go anywhere except for a run, which would then be followed by… no work.\n\nWhat I realized was that I needed more than time off and leisurely hours. I began to see that the rest I longed for was the kind that could be accessed even while working and without two months off, in any season of life—the rest offered in the scriptures.\n\nI imagine Moses thought he needed a break too. Leading the Israelites out of Egypt was no cakewalk. And even after he led them out, they complained and whined and complained some more. Then, after turning his back for just a few days while on Mt. Sinai, the people forgot about their God and built a golden calf. So when God tells Moses to take His people and go into the promised land, Moses becomes worried; I can almost hear it in his voice, begging God to not abandon them. But God reassures him and says, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest” (Exodus 33:14).\n\nThat’s the rest I was looking for, the kind that can only be found in God’s presence. For the first time I understood Jesus’s offer of rest. When we place all our confidence in the life, teaching, death, and resurrection of Jesus that has brought us peace with God, well, that’s true and lasting rest—not the world’s version. We were made for more than even the sunniest days in this broken world; we were made for an eternity lived in God’s presence.\n\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWe can find courage and hope to endure all things because the powerful presence of our God goes with us.\n\nKing David’s life testified to the fact that God is an ever-present helper to His people. When we are overwhelmed by life’s troubles we may reach for our phones, though our phone calls to friends go unanswered. When at a crucial impasse we may seek the advice of trusted confidantes, but our text messages might go unseen. But God is always present and available and attentive—if only we’d turn to Him (2Timothy 4:16–18).\n\nGod was with David as he stood alone and protected his father’s sheep from predators the likes of lions and bears (1Samuel 17:34–36). God was with David when he and his fellow Israelites stood outmanned and outgunned before the opposing Philistine army and their giant, Goliath (1Samuel 17). God was with David when King Saul turned his ire against David and conspired to kill him (1Samuel 19). And God was even with David following David’s illicit tryst with Bathsheba and the subsequent murder of her husband, Uriah (2Samuel 12). Without fail, God is a helper who is always found in times of trouble (Psalm 46:1), even when that trouble is of our own concocting.\n\nAs the saying goes, “The shepherd smells like his sheep.” And rest assured, our Shepherd certainly smells like His sheep, because our God is unfailingly present among us. He is with His sheep, abiding with us and among us in the fields as we rest without a care in the world; He quiets us with His peace, but He also delights and rejoices in our very existence (Zephaniah 3:17). He is with His sheep among life’s dangerous crags, and more than that, He is faithful to gather us from the hazardous cliffs of this earthly life (Isaiah 40:11). And perhaps most profoundly, He is with His sheep in the darkness and in the mud, and He even helps us navigate our way out of the troubles that we create for ourselves (Matthew 18:12).\n\nDavid may have been king, but he was also once a shepherd, and he could clearly recall with great detail the duties of that former occupation. Perhaps he remembered the panicked bleating of his herd when a lion or bear would draw near, but also the trust his herd had in him and the calm that came over them when he was present. He himself knew the faithful presence of God. David knew that while everyone else may desert him, the Lord would remain, strengthening him to carry out his calling, but also tending to his own heart’s needs, rescuing him from evil when he strayed, and then bringing him safely back into the safety of His presence (2Timothy 4:16–18).\n\nEven in life’s bleakest moments and most unfavorable conditions, even when predators the likes of lions and bears are stalking nearby—“God is our refuge and strength, a helper who is always found in times of trouble “like these, so there is no need to be afraid (Psalm 46:1–3). Even if the ground we’re on seems to quake and give way, our God is with us and His presence supplies us with hope and courage against any odds.\n\nWritten by Sean Bess\n\n",

It would be intimidating and awe-inspiring, to be sure. But would you respond like this?\n\nWoe is me for I am ruined\n\nbecause I am a man of unclean lips\n\nand live among a people of unclean lips,\n\nand because my eyes have seen the King,\n\nthe LORD of Armies” (Isaiah 6:5).\n\nProbably not. Even the greatest ruler in human history or the finest, earthly throne room doesn’t deserve this kind of response.\n\nBut when the prophet Isaiah was ushered into the very presence of God and saw Him in all His inexpressible glory this was his response, and rightfully so (Isaiah 6:1–7). It would be our response, too, for we are of that same people of “unclean lips.” Revelation 4 paints an even fuller picture of the enormity and perfection of God’s glory as it describes the stormy wonder of His presence and then declares Him “holy, holy, holy, holy” and “worthy to receive glory and honor and power” (vv.8,11). Isaiah responded this way because he saw his own—all of humanity’s, really—lack of holiness and worthiness. We have no place in God’s presence. We are unclean because of sin.\n\nBut it was never God’s intention to separate Himself from His people. Throughout Scripture He proves Himself to be a rescuing and relating God. In Leviticus 11:45, God says, “For I am the LORD, who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God, so you must be holy because I am holy.” God is making clear His intention to be with His people and His expectation that we should be holy and sinless, like He is. But how? We are unclean and unworthy and can’t purify ourselves.\n\nGod knew this, too, and so He made a way for us to be with Him. Ephesians 2 lays it out for us so clearly: “But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ” (v.13). We were once unworthy, but we now have Jesus’s worthiness. Jesus is our peace, the reconciler of God and man (v.14). Jesus grants us access to the Father (v.18).\n\nGod sent His Son so that we would be able to enter His presence. He welcomes us through Christ so that we can “with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need” (Hebrews 4:16). The very God who is so holy and majestic as to strike Isaiah with fear, who is worthy of all praise and glory, who rescued His people from Egypt, is the God who now offers mercy and grace for those who come to Him through His Son. He welcomes us into His glorious presence, whole and purified in Jesus.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod is not only universally present above and beyond creation; He is also personally present, dwelling with His people.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I thought the point of religion was to go to heaven when I died. And I thought of heaven as a paradise: streets of gold, pearly gates, private mansions—all that. I thought it would be a place that would have all my favorite things, all for free, and I could indulge every appetite without consequence of gaining weight or getting hurt. By going to church now, all this could be mine.\n\nThe story Scripture gives us about the purpose of faith in God, however, is radically different. Yes, God’s Word speaks of heaven, but the more you study and learn what the Bible has to say about about life after death, the more you’ll see that it has very little to do with the place itself, and has everything to do with the fact that we will be united to our Creator in face-to-face intimacy for all eternity, which is what our hearts long for the most. This is what Augustine was getting at when he wrote, “Every man who knocks on the door of a brothel is looking for God.” We were created to be in the presence of our Maker.\n\nColossians 1 has a series of verses that sing this truth with breathtaking majesty. “[Christ] is before all things, and by him all things hold together” (Colossians 1:17). The kid dreaming about those mansions with jewel-encrusted gates was thinking about the stuff of glory, not the source. Our God is not just a magnificent Creator who creates and then leaves. He creates for the purpose of eternal fellowship. He isn’t just present in the creation of the cosmos. He is personally still in the mix, present with His people—not just after we leave this life. He is with us now. Always.\n\nThe promise of God’s presence with us even now really is the beauty of the gospel. God’s call on the lives of His people is to Himself. Through Christ, He reconciles us to Himself, at His own cost, for the sake of His own glory, and for our eternal joy. This is both the beauty and perhaps one of the more elusive truths of Scripture, too: that God really is with us right now. It’s not that we’ll meet up with Him when we die. It’s not that He’ll show up now if we call out to Him. It’s that He is presently, actively holding all things together, including our lives. He is never not involved. Never not near. Never not working all things together for our good (Romans 8:28).\n\nI thank God that the point of faith is not merely to receive a reward at the end of this life, because this life can be so hard sometimes. I am thankful to know the Lord is always present, and always working here and now. This assures us that when we call to Him in prayer, He is already up to speed, and more presently invested in our flourishing than we could ever imagine. That’s better than a hundred mansions.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",
