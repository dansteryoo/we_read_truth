    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 1:1-17, 2 Samuel 7:12-16, 2 Corinthians 5:17\nIf you could have access to only one book for the rest of your life, which would you choose? \nJudging from their devoted habits and bold commentary, it seems a great many theological giants in Church history would have made Romans their go-to text for a lifetime. Early church father John Chrysostom had the book read aloud to him once a week. Poet and preacher Samuel Taylor Coleridge called it “the profoundest piece of writing in existence.” The famous sixteenth-century Bible translator William Tyndale wrote of Romans, “It is the principal and most excellent part of the New Testament… No man can read it too oft.” Martin Luther, St. Augustine, and John Wesley all came to assured faith through the impact of Romans.\nWhat is it about this book that has captivated the attention of believers across the ages? What makes Romans so unique? \nAll Scripture is God-breathed and equally valuable—God’s special revelation given to us that we might know Him. But Romans is distinct in that it provides the most comprehensive expression of the gospel found in the Bible. This book reaches back deep into the Old Testament to walk us through the origin and problem of sin, the reality of guilt, and the impossibility of saving ourselves. And it presents, systematically yet succinctly, the ultimate rescue we’re given in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\nIn short, Romans contains the essential gospel.\nFrom the opening statements of his letter, Paul makes clear his purpose for writing: to present and promote the gospel of Jesus Christ. He introduces himself as Christ’s servant, “set apart for the gospel of God” (Romans 1:1). He addresses the letter to “all who are in Rome, loved by God,” expressing his commitment to telling them “the good news about [God’s] Son” (vv.7-9). And he conveys how desperately he has desired to visit the city personally: “I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome” (v.15).\nPaul then turns from his brief introduction to make a stunningly clear pronouncement on where he stands when it comes to the message of Christ:\nFor I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.\n– Romans 1:16\nPaul was confident in his calling to preach the gospel because he was certain of the saving power of his God. I am a servant of Christ… I am an apostle… I am set apart for the gospel… I am eager to preach the good news… I am not ashamed. \nIt is with this unshakeable confidence that Paul, the self-proclaimed “worst of sinners” (1 Timothy 1:15), wrote to the believers at Rome—to explain to Jewish and Gentile converts alike what it means to believe in and be redeemed by Jesus Christ. For this is no metaphorical salvation; it is the real-life rescue of broken and complicated people by the all-powerful hand of a merciful God.\nLean in close as Paul presents his longest letter in Scripture, a sermon on what it means to be a Christ follower in this life. Listen as he tells of God’s holiness, justice, and compassion. Read this book as though it is telling a single story—the story of how God rescues us through the sacrifice of Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 1:18-32, Proverbs 1:7, 2 Timothy 3:1-9\nIn all of Paul’s letters, there are few bleaker passages than the one we encounter in Romans 1:18-32. Here Paul paints a picture of total depravity, gleeful rebellion, and blind rejection of God—all of which incur the deserved wrath of God. It’s dark and it’s grim, but there is one thing you especially need to know about it:\nIt’s your story.\nIf you’re like me, that might sound strange. Like many lifelong Christians, I was raised in the church, a rule-following “good girl” who never colored outside the lines. My life looks nothing like Paul’s portrait of self-destruction. And yet, his language is intentionally vague. He never specifies who this passage is about. Scholars have speculated—perhaps it’s about Adam and Eve, or perhaps he is describing non-Christians. But most scholars, like Dr. Douglas Moo, a professor at Wheaton College, interpret his words more broadly: “[Paul] has in view human beings generally, prone to turn away from God because of the original fall into sin.” \nIn other words, this passage is about us. \nPaul speaks of the “godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth”—the people who struggle with “envy, murder, quarrels, deceit, and malice” (vv.18, 29). And those people he’s describing? Well, they’re us—all of us. Paul isn’t singling out a particular group of people; he’s diagnosing the human condition. \nLeft to our own devices, sin distorts our souls like water-warped wood. For every human ever born, that is our story. At least, it would have been our story had God not intervened.\nWhat we see in Romans 1:18-32 is a vision of our fate, had God not planned our rescue. Without God’s grace we were all “by nature deserving of wrath” (Ephesians 2:3). To understand exactly what these harsh words mean, we must be careful not to confuse God’s “wrath” with human forms of anger. Theologian John Stott describes human anger as “irrational and uncontrollable emotion, containing much vanity, animosity, malice, and the desire for revenge.” God’s wrath, on the other hand, “is absolutely free of all such poisonous ingredients.” \nBy comparison, God’s wrath is His “holy hostility to evil.” This hostility is not arbitrary. God does not pick rules out of a hat, and smite those who fail to conform. No, God directs His hostility squarely at the destructive effects of sin. Sin steals, kills, and destroys everything it touches, including the crown jewel of His creation: humankind. It degrades and dismantles us, and God’s response to this cosmic terrorism is total opposition. God opposes sin because He is good and righteous and just. \nHe also opposes it because of His love. Like a father’s white-knuckle rage at his son’s addiction, or a mother’s howling grief at her daughter’s eating disorder, God’s wrath is an expression of His love. It is hostility towards that which devours His children whole.\nThis side of eternity, we may never understand the mysterious balance between God’s active condemnation and the natural consequences of human sin. But together, these two elements constitute God’s righteous wrath against all human sin. That is our story—every one of us. Apart from the grace of God, we would only choose death. \nWhenever we read these words, we must ask the Spirit to reveal ourselves within them, because we cannot have the good news without the bad news. We cannot call it “salvation” if we are not being saved from something—namely, ourselves. Self-ruin is the only place our sin will ever take us. But, thanks to Jesus, it doesn’t have to.\n\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 2:1-16, Deuteronomy 16:18-20, Titus 1:15\nHead shaking, brow furrowed, she looked perplexed. Confusion filled her dark brown eyes. “I don’t understand,” she said.\nI explained further. “The Chinese and Japanese character used to translate ‘sin’ is the word zui, which means ‘crime.’”\nShe nodded and motioned for me to continue.\n“I think that translation can be somewhat limiting. I imagine you haven’t really spent time in jail or committed a crime like robbing a bank. I imagine you consider yourself a pretty good person.”\nShe nodded again. \n“I used to think of myself as a pretty good person, too” I said. “But then someone asked, if a movie were made of my life, if there were certain scenes I’d want deleted. I knew exactly which scenes I didn’t want anyone to see. And these scenes were not just of the times I did things I knew I shouldn’t, but also when I didn’t do things I knew I should. Our sin problem shows itself in both ways—in the things we do and the things we don’t do. We all sin. No one lives a life free of scenes they wouldn’t want others to see.”\nPaul goes to great lengths in the first three chapters of Romans to help us understand the totality and consequences of our sin. He lists the manifestations of sin at the end of chapter one, then goes on to explain how his readers not only judge others, but also practice the very things for which they pass judgment. \nAnd it’s true: most of us consider ourselves “good” people, qualified to judge others for their many shortcomings—that is, until we place our own sin-plagued lives next to Christ’s righteousness. Jesus is the only one who lived a perfect, God-honoring, shame-free life. \nBoth Jews and Gentiles—and both you and I—fall short under God’s holy judgment. We are all guilty, often of the very same things for which we condemn others. But there is good news: \nFor God loved the world in this way. He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.\n– John 3:16\nWe are born spiritually dead, our sin separating us from a life with God. But God, in the person of Jesus Christ, has made a way for us to know Him, both in this earthly life and for all eternity (John 17:3). \nJust as God Himself provides the way for us to be reconciled to Him, He also does the work of revealing to us our sin—of showing us how our “goodness” falls short of His righteousness. The Holy Spirit does the convicting (John 16:8), which frees us to love and to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15).\nIn Romans, Paul writes systematically to knock away our sense of ever being righteous in and of ourselves. God’s invitation is not to mere ethics or manufactured goodness, but to the utter, complete transformation that takes place when we are made new in Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17).\nMay God melt away our pride that keeps us from total dependence on Him. By His grace, may we love others, even as they fall short like we also do. And may we recognize and receive God’s kindness that leads us to repentance.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 2:17-29, Deuteronomy 7:25-26, Psalm 51:1-12\nIn one of my seminary classes, we were to read Athanasius’ On the Incarnation, as well as— according to the syllabus—the book’s preface written by C.S. Lewis. Paying close attention to the syllabus (thought not that close), I read both the preface and the introduction.\nA few weeks later, during his lecture, the professor pointed out that we technically didn’t have to read the book’s introduction, but he said if we’d been smart, we would have. He explained this had been his intention—even if the syllabus hadn’t spelled it out explicitly.\nWas he assuming we were mind readers? Not really. He just had expectations. \nAt some point, we all give instructions—to colleagues, to children, to friends, to husbands—that may not be perfect or exact, but we hope the recipient will pick up on our intent, on the spirit of what we’re asking them to do. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t. \nPaul is giving a similar instruction here to the Jewish Christians in Rome. He is echoing Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, asking Jesus’ followers to read deeper into the Law. Paul tells them it’s not about following the letter of the law. It’s about following the heart of the One who wrote it. \nPaul’s laundry list of law-breaking activities in verses 21-23, reads similarly to what Jesus said in Matthew 5:\nYou have heard that it was said to those of old, “You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.” But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment.\n– Matthew 5:21-22\nJesus preached these words to some who knew the Law backwards and forwards, but He was holding up a magnifying glass to their hearts. They weren’t out murdering people—they were law-following Jews, after all—but what was going on in their hearts? Were they angry with their brother? Jesus said then they, too, are deserving of punishment. The spirit of the Law was broken, even if the exact rule was not. \nPaul does the same for his readers. He questions their obedience to the Law, but then he reminds them it’s the posture of their hearts that matters most. These proud Jewish Christians came from a long heritage of trying to earn righteousness by following the Law. They too easily forgot that Jesus came to fulfill the Law for them, to make them righteous by simply believing in Him. \nIt’s not hard to see myself in the Jewish Christians of Rome, slipping back into trying to follow the rules rather than the One who wrote them. It’s easy to think my righteousness comes from  acting the right way, rather than from “the Way” Himself (John 14:6). But as the psalmist tells us, “would God not discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart” (Psalm 44:21).\nIf I’m honest, what’s going on inside my heart is usually much uglier than how I act on the outside. Thankfully, Jesus came to wash me clean from the inside out. This is the beauty of the cross and the gift of the Holy Spirit: to compel me to seek God’s heart first, and obey His law by the help of His Spirit.\n \nMelanie Rainer is the director of content for JellyTelly, where she writes and edits family spiritual formation resources.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 3:1-20, Psalm 14:1-7, Ecclesiastes 7:20\n“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”\nIf you read Paul’s letters enough, you’re bound to catch this recurring theme.\nWhy did he find it so important for believers in the first century (and us!) to understand they were sinners?\nBecause God loves sinners.\n“But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us!” (Rm 5:8).\nJesus came to earth for sinners. He lived, died, and rose again for sinners. He forgives sinners. And sinners who place their faith in Him are welcomed into His family.\nThat’s really good news for sinners, right? And Scripture leaves no doubt. You, me, and every person on earth… we’re all sinners. That’s the bottom line Paul lays out in Romans 3:23.\nWe’re all broken, needy, and messed-up in a way that simply being “good” can never fix.  \nSince the Garden of Eden, our identity as humans has been marked by our tendency to rebel against God. That’s why we can never behave our way into a right relationship with Him. The most well-behaved, law-abiding, church-attending, choir-singing, modest-dressing, moralistic person alive, apart from Jesus Christ, is still dead in her trespasses and sins (Eph 2:1).\nThe heartbeat of the gospel is not, “Clean up your act, obey the rules, and God will forgive you.” That’s moralism, not Christianity. Any one of us who has ever tried to be a perfect person, even for a day, knows that approach simply doesn’t work. That false gospel stands in direct contradiction to the true one: Christ died for sinners. Because He loves us, remember?\nDo we encourage each other—and ourselves—to obedience? Absolutely! But let’s also remember that righteousness does not come through our obedience. Right standing with God comes only through faith in Jesus—His works and not our own. As Paul says in verse 24, “They are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”\nThrough Jesus, grace flows freely to sinners. Through Jesus, those guilty and condemned are declared righteous—justified by His sacrifice, by grace through faith. And through Jesus, polluted sinners exchange filthy rags for robes of righteousness.\n“I greatly rejoice in the Lord,\nI exult in my God;\nfor has clothed me with the garments of salvation\nand wrapped me in a robe of righteousness… ” (Isaiah 61:10).\n\nCarrie Gaul is a biblical correspondent for Revive Our Hearts. She and her husband Dennis have two married children and are enjoying grandchildren. Carrie has a deep love for God’s Word and a passion to see women grow in ever-increasing intimacy with Jesus through the study and application of His Word.\nEditor’s Note: In Romans, Paul is building a case for the good news that is ours in Christ by faith. He uses these early chapters to establish our guilt before God—which he does to establish our need for a Savior. One of the most challenging aspects of the gospel is that it is based on the death and resurrection of Christ, necessitated by our own sin. We cannot understand the depth of God’s love for us in Christ without understanding the depth of our need for that sacrifice and the sin it covers. Because of Jesus, our sin is not counted against us, so we are never just “sinners.” We are redeemed sinners. A new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). What an amazing gift it is to know that “God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).\nThis essay was revised on August 28, 2017. \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 3:21-31, Ephesians 1:7-10, Colossians 1:13-14\nI love a good “before and after.”\nWhether it’s watching the last ten minutes of an episode of HGTV’s Fixer Upper or following a designer’s Instagram feed, I just can’t get enough of those visual transformations. Give me all the before-and-after shots of your kitchen, bathroom, closet—even your hair!—magically morphed from cluttered to clean. I never, ever tire of them.\nReading Romans 3:21-31 reminds me of my makeover obsession. These verses are all about our “after”—who we are because of God’s grace “by the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (v.24). The power of this passage lies in its contrast to the one before it. What would an “after” photo be if we never saw the “before”?\nA beautiful kitchen is a beautiful kitchen. But when we see that kitchen as it once was—dated tile, linoleum floors, and missing cabinet doors—compared to its transformed state of marble countertops and hardwood floors, we appreciate its newness and beauty that much more.\nSo let’s back up to Romans 3:20, our “before” shot that says, “For no one will be justified in his sight by the works of the law, because the knowledge of sin comes through the law.” That’s bad news for us. It means all the good stuff we did last week, all the good deeds and hard work—it’s all meaningless in itself.\nBut…\nBut now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the Law and the Prophets. The righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.\n– Romans 3:21-22\nThis, friends, is the good news! No, we are not justified by the law, but we are justified in Christ.\nGod presented him as an atoning sacrifice in his blood, received through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be righteous and declare righteous the one who has faith in Jesus.\n– Romans 3:25-26\nNow, imagine knowing this good news with no understanding of the bad news that preceded it. Imagine seeing the “after” without seeing the “before.” It wouldn’t really be good news then, would it? In light of the bad news, the promise found in verses 25-26 is that much brighter, more hopeful. The contrast is everything.\nOur before is not a pretty picture. It is devoid of God and, therefore, full of despair. As Paul quoted the Hebrew scriptures, “all have turned away…ruin and wretchedness are in their paths” (Romans 3:12,16).\nBut…\nThis passage today is our after. The ones who have faith in Jesus are righteous. Not the ones who do the most, achieve the most, or follow the letter of the law the best. Unlike those HGTV makeovers, it’s not the amount of work we put in that brings us from before to after; it’s Christ’s work on the cross that transforms us. He, and He alone, declares us righteous before the one true God.\nPerhaps this is why I love seeing visual transformations so much. They help me to remember the gospel’s redemption in my own life. It’s a reminder I desperately need to hear, over and over again. It was not our blood, sweat, and tears that brought us back into relationship with God. It was His.\nWe are forever grateful, Jesus.\n\n\nAndrea Lucado is a freelance writer, Texas native, and the author of the memoir English Lessons: The Crooked Path of Growing Toward Faith.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 4:1-25, Psalm 32:1-2, Ephesians 2:4-7\nLet me tell you what everybody’s talking about these days: kale. I know, first telegrams were all the rage, later to be followed by fast food drive-thrus, “The Electric Slide,” and space travel. But now we’ve finally peaked with an affection for curly leaves that sprout from the ground.\nAt first, I really thought I was missing out. Kale seemed to be every celebrity’s best kept secret, every magazine’s healthy choice, and every grocery cart’s consistent companion. So, I tossed a bunch of kale into my produce bag and raced to the checkout line, anxious to taste this treat of the century. In the car, I tore the stem off like a cupcake wrapper, stuffing a handful of leaves into my mouth. I wanted to like it more than anything, but friends, gag reflexes don’t lie.\nIn contrast to the controversial kale, it would be difficult to find someone who didn’t like Abraham. His popularity was well-deserved, his reputation flawless, his character impeccable. The Jews looked up to him as a forefather paving the trail of faith, a man whose righteousness, they hoped, would inspire their own. If they were anything like me, they’d stuff themselves silly with anything that promised a chance at gaining his status.\nPerhaps some Jews tried to duplicate Abraham’s righteousness with their own try-hard attempts at earning favor with God. But no matter their determination, the results would remain bitter and unsavory. Exhausted, they might look to him and wonder, How does he do it?\nI asked the same of my friend Amanda, who eats a salad for lunch every single day and, consequently, is very well versed in the area of all-things-kale. She laughed, explaining that no one eats kale plain. Apparently (you probably already knew this), you drench it in dressing, blend it in a smoothie, or soften it with olive oil. By itself, kale isn’t the star ingredient, but when covered in other flavors, it gets all the credit for being delicious. Abraham’s secret had a similar flavor: “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness” (Romans 4:3).\nAt first glance, it’s easy to assume that if anyone could achieve righteousness, it would probably be a guy like Abraham. But like you and me, he had sin pumping through his veins. And so Abraham is not the achiever in this passage—God is. Abraham simply believed God and His promises.\nNow to the one who works, pay is not considered as a gift, but as something owed. But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who declares the ungodly to be righteous, his faith is credited for righteousness.\n– Romans 4:4-5\nHear this good news, friends. Because Christ was righteousness in our place, we, too, are drenched in His goodness, credited with His coveted status—we’re the very fragrance of Christ before our Father (2 Corinthians 2:14). May we always believe with the faith of Abraham, receiving God’s promises with open hands and thankful hearts. Amen.\n \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 5:1-11, Galatians 4:6-7, Ephesians 2:18-22\nSeven years ago I found myself so emotionally, physically, and spiritually debilitated that just getting out of bed in the morning was difficult. I’d never struggled with acute depression before, but after soldiering through the deaths of several of my loved ones and a cancer scare of my own, my get-up-and-go was totally gone. All I wanted was to wave a white flag at life and crawl under the covers, venturing out just long enough to grab another pint of ice cream.\nIf someone had given me some perky acrostic or suggested I listen to a sermon entitled, “Ten Things Victorious Christians Do to Kick Disappointment and Despair to the Curb,” I’d have kicked them in the shins. Fortunately, Lynn, the Christian counselor I’ve gone to for years, doesn’t prescribe the dangerous meds of “minimizing grief” or “multiplying guilt.” Instead, she was silent as I sobbed, empathetic as I lamented.\nLynn gave me this advice: “Cling to Jesus and do the next right thing.” \nShe told me to stop trying to tackle the troubles of an entire day, much less a week, month, or year. I was simply to move forward one step at a time. Some days I’d wake to the alarm clock only to be hit with a shock of emotion as I remembered my circumstances. And other days, just whispering the name of our Savior gave me enough grit to pull back the covers and get out of bed.\nDay by day, inch by laborious inch, Jesus led me by the hand through that dark valley of life— one step at a time. \nI know far too many people who have lost their joy and all but lost their faith in Jesus because endurance was an overlooked muscle group in their Christian vocabulary. And so they’d stop attending Bible study, then church, fading away from their faith community in the midst of their malaise. Some have been wounded by that very same community of believers. Others have simply lost the energy and will to put on a happy face, to pretend their get-up-and-go hasn’t left them too.\nSurely our Creator-Redeemer weeps over the gaping holes in the fabric of His covenant family. We weren’t created to be wincing, jaded isolationists. We were created in God’s image, in the image of the triune God who exists in perfect relational harmony with Himself as Father, Son, and Spirit (Genesis 1:26). We’re hardwired for relationship, for communing with others of the faith.\nWhen life leaves us disappointed, disillusioned, and despairing, we need to resist the urge to withdraw from the body of Christ. Instead, we need to move toward other passionate—albeit flawed—Christ-followers to walk with us toward healing. We need to be honest with them, with God, and with ourselves about the true state of our hearts. We need them circling around us, crying out, “Abba Father!” on our behalf, reminding us of the Truth: we are no longer slaves, but daughters of the one true God (Galatians 4:6-7).\nTogether, we can persevere toward the living hope of the Lord Jesus Christ to whom we’ve been called. \nOnly God can love us unconditionally. Hoping in Him will never disappoint us the way the world does time and time again. Because “God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit” we can learn to rejoice and hope again, even in our pain (Romans 5:3,5). But it’s only in clinging to Him that we will find the strength to move forward in faith, one step at a time.\n\nLisa Harper is a master storyteller with a masters of Theological Studies from Covenant Seminary. She’s lauded as an engaging, hilarious communicator as well as an authentic and substantive Bible teacher. She’s been in vocational ministry for 30 years and has written 15 books (her latest being, The Sacrament of Happy: What a Smiling God Brings to a Wounded World) and Bible study curriculums but says her greatest accomplishment by far is that of becoming Missy’s (her adopted daughter from Haiti) mama!

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 5:12-21, Genesis 3:17-19, 1 Corinthians 15:21-22\nSometimes, the weight of living this life just gets to us. It feels sticky and scratchy, less graceful and more gritty. We wander into and out of seasons that leave us asking where God is in the middle of grief or loss or emptiness. \nA few weeks ago, I lost my grandfather slowly and suddenly. He was tired one day and hospitalized the next. Not three weeks later, he was gone.\nIn those days between admitting him to the hospital and him meeting Jesus, I couldn’t seem to rectify the fact that what was happening felt so foreign and yet so expected. Death is a terrible reality that we live with, an awful and haunting sort of event that wrecks us. But, as we learn early on, it’s inevitable: death is a part of life.\nOne night, as I was adjusting his oxygen mask, my fingers combed through his hair, damp with sweat because his breathing was so labored. It reminded me of my nieces waking from a nap, their fine hair damp and sticking to their foreheads. And then I thought of my grandfather as a young boy, running around, playing and sweaty. His mother must have pushed his hair off his forehead, just as I was doing now.\nLater, after he was gone, a friend would remark to me, “You know, we labor into this world and we really labor out of it, too.”\nOne evening around dusk, I pulled him up to a sitting position, and together we shuffled over to a chair by the window. I sat in front of him, asking question after question about his life. The vesper light caught his eyes as he told me about a career of flying planes all around the world for the Navy. We both knew things were drawing to a close. Still, in that moment, I sensed a very real peace. We both did. It was as if we both understood that our bodies may break down, but Christ has given us life that will carry on for the rest of eternity.\nPart of me couldn’t believe his earthly life was coming to an end. But another part of me knew better: this is what happens. Sometimes, we live so deeply rooted in our fallen, fragile reality that we forget there is another, better, truer one.\nFor if by the one man’s trespass the many died, how much more have the grace of God and the gift which comes through the grace of the one man Jesus Christ overflowed to the many.\n– Romans 5:15\nWhen I’m in the throes of hospital visits and errands and trying to make the best of every moment, I can forget the truth. Because of Jesus, life is more than survival or death. It is eternal (Romans 5:20-21).\nThese days since my grandfather’s death, I’ve been thinking about how, as a Christian, I live a life marked by beautiful disagreement. Even when it seems death is the only option, the life and light of Christ finds a way to break through. Even when 21 shots are fired and a flag is folded graveside, there is still hope. Even as we watched the setting sun one last time together, we saw the beauty in the darkness.\nEven in death, grace reigns.\n\nMelissa Zaldivar is a social in the world of academics and an academic in the world of socials.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebekah Lyons\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 6:1-14, 2 Corinthians 5:18-21, Colossians 3:1-11\nMy daughter was baptized a few months ago.\nShe decided to follow Jesus in her elementary years, and considered baptism a long while until she entered middle school. The week prior, a pastor from our church sat down in our kitchen to talk to her about the weight of this decision. She was choosing to publicly testify Christ as her Lord to anyone who asked. This was a commitment to follow and serve Jesus no matter what, even when it was difficult.\nThe following Sunday she wrote a letter to Jesus, just between them, and pinned it to a wooden cross at the front of our sanctuary before taking her turn in the waters. As her daddy lowered her beneath the water he offered the words, “buried with Jesus in the likeness of His death, and raised to walk in newness of life” (Romans 6:4).\nScripture says we joined Jesus in His death when we were baptized. Death no longer rules over Christ Jesus, nor does it rule over those who believe in Him. What’s more, when we died with Christ, we were set free from the power of sin. “For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time.” As believers in Christ Jesus, we are to “consider [ourselves] dead to sin and alive to God” (vv. 9-11).\nBut if we’ve truly died to sin, why do we continue to live in it? The act of sharing in Christ’s death wouldn’t be a one-time thing any more than taking communion would be a one-time thing. In fact, we’re told to examine our hearts before we take the bread and the cup (1 Corinthians 11:27). We ought to examine our hearts in everything and invite God to search our hearts too (Psalm 139:23).\nWhen we take a lackadaisical approach to our sin, we give it room to rule over us, to distract us. As those who have been crucified with Christ, sin is no longer our ruler. We are not under the law but under grace (Galatians 2:20; Romans 6:14).\nThis begs the question: What in my life needs to die each day? What has become an idol, a security, a focus, or a prop that has pushed God aside? I never seem to see sin enter my heart until I hear it roll off my tongue—a little sarcasm here, a critique there. Then envy soon follows, before resentment settles in and camps out. \nFor starters, my pride needs to die. It needs to die a thousand deaths. It’s the temptation of the religious leader to get puffed up by our words, thinking the message is ours. But the truth is that God has planted His Word in our hearts (Hebrews 10:16). We are simply called to speak His Word when summoned.\nThere’s something else that needs to die for me in this season: production. It’s time for me to get quiet after a long season of pouring out. Making room for the death of an idol opens wide the gates for a new beginning, a new imagination for what God will bring about in the days ahead. I’m walking out these days with an expectant heart, putting my ear to the ground, and listening for a fresh refrain of reverence.\nI wonder, is there something that needs to die for you today? When you are joined in Christ’s death through faith, you are also raised with Him in newness of life. Laying down your idols will open the floodgates for freedom to reign once more, making room for new life to spring forth again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 6:15-23, Galatians 5:13-14, 1 Peter 2:11-17\nWhen I was in elementary school, I decided I was going to grow an apple tree in our backyard. I didn’t tell my family about it. I wanted to do it secretly so that one day when there was a blossoming apple tree growing out of my mother’s flower bed, everyone would be amazed and I could reveal that I had grown it.\nI hoarded an apple seed from an apple I had eaten earlier in the day and smuggled it into the backyard when no one was looking. I dug a shallow hole in the flowerbed, placed the seed inside, and covered it with dirt. Then I hoped for the best.\nIn our last Romans passage we learned that Jesus’ death and resurrection does not mean life is a free-for-all, or that we can live however we like because of God’s grace. It means our motivation has changed. We don’t live under the yoke of the law any longer; we live under the covering of Christ, and that gift of grace motivates us to live by God’s Word.  \nIn Romans 6:15-23, Paul gives us another reason why Christians should not continue to sin simply because grace is now at play: fruit.\nBefore you knew Christ, Paul says, you were slaves of sin (Romans 6:17). And “…when you were slaves of sin, you were free from allegiance to righteousness. So what fruit was produced then from the things you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death. But now, since you have been liberated from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification—and the end is eternal life!” (Romans 6:22).\nWhen we interpret the message of grace as permission to continue sinning, we miss out on living a life that bears fruit, and instead, we live lives marked by death, for that is what sin is. This is not only harmful to our own souls; it is harmful to our witness. First Peter 2:12 says, “Conduct yourselves honorably among the Gentiles, so that when they slander you as evildoers, they will observe your good works and will glorify God on the day he visits.”\nOur lives do not bear fruit in order for us to look good to others. Our lives bear fruit so that others will see it and know its Source. A fruitless life does not point to our Creator. A fruit-filled one glorifies Him with each step we take (John 15:8).  \nYou can probably guess what happened with my apple seed in the backyard. Absolutely nothing. While I had the big idea right—apple seed leads to apple tree—I went about it all wrong. If you really want to grow an apple tree in your backyard, it’s much more complicated than burying a seed and hoping for the best. I looked it up. The real process involves things like “germinating” and “grafting” and transferring the plant from various-sized pots until it is ready for the ground. Then maybe, hopefully, your tree will grow and bear fruit.\nI eventually forgot all about my apple tree. Days, weeks, and months went by, and since nothing was growing, I forgot about the seed and my little secret plan. It had been a fruitless effort because I had not properly cared for its growth.\nOh, that my Christian life would be the opposite of that poor, non-existent apple tree, that I would live motivated by grace so that others would see a life in full bloom, and that its beauty would point them to its source.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "How Can Death Bring Life?",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Annie Downs\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 7:1-13, Proverbs 1:19, John 14:6-7\nMy buddy Andrea wrote yesterday’s post, and I loved it. But no offense to her, sometimes real, live fruit can show up without much planning. Here’s what I mean.\nI follow one of my favorite Instagram accounts specifically for the Insta-stories. One account I adore is of an incredibly fun mom living in Florida. Last week, she did three or four videos of the same tree: an avocado tree. Hanging from the branches were dozens of avocados.\n“Look at these beauties!” she yelled to the camera, “And my husband takes all the credit for this tree!”\nApparently, a few years before, he’d planted the pit of an avocado there in the backyard, just behind the pool, and voila! AVOCADOS! He didn’t plan it or even care for it. Just planted the pit once the original avocado was eaten and then didn’t think about it again.\nJust a dead pit. Buried in the ground.\nWhat viewers like me saw was the tree—the product, the fruit grown from the death. But the part we didn’t see were all those days in the middle. The dead days. The days where nothing grew and nothing changed on the outside, but everything was changing on the inside.\nI need to see the avocados. And I need to see the dead days too. Because I feel them. Don’t you? There are stories in my life that just plain feel dead. It feels like I did all the work I knew to do, and yet nothing seems to be growing or changing.\nBut death brings life. So it is with us because of Jesus.\nTherefore, my brothers and sisters, you also were put to death in relation to the law through the body of Christ so that you may belong to another… (Romans 7:4).\nTo be a Christian means that we belong to Jesus. And He belongs to us. Our sin was there on the cross. Our flesh was crucified with Him. And when He went to the grave to conquer death, He took our sin—our past, present, and still-to-come-future sin—with Him and buried it all there.\nAfter those three dead days had passed, Jesus came back, fully alive, and brought us, His made-new creation, with Him (2 Corinthians 5:17).\nI’m not a huge avocado fan, but I can see an object lesson when it’s before me. So I went to the grocery store, found two avocadoes that felt ripe-ish, and bought them. I didn’t have a plan—I just knew I needed them.\nI got home, sliced one open, and no kidding, the minute I saw the pit I started crying. Because I saw it, right there in the middle, the death that had grown life and sustenance. I pulled it out with a knife, washed it off in the sink, and just held it. And prayed.\nI asked God about all the avocado pits I see in my life, things that look dead. And I asked if they were ever going to grow into something that mattered. Did they matter? Did He even see them?\n…You belong to him who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God (v.4, continued).\nWhile the Holy Spirit whispered truth to me, I already knew it; I saw it there in the avocado. Of course, He sees it all. He alone brings life from death, even when it feels like no new fruit will ever will grow in those dry, barren places.\nI breathed a prayer of thanks. And then I made guacamole.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 7:14-25, Galatians 5:16-26, 1 John 1:8-10\nSure, I was terrible. But it was the fruit flies’ fault.\nI’d been at war with them all week, using every trick Google assured me would work. Bowl of vinegar mixed with dish soap? Done. A trap made of fruit and plastic wrap? Yep. Pour diluted bleach down the drain and hope for the best? Affirmative.\nI’d done all the entire internet knew to do, to no avail. The fruit flies were multiplying, not disappearing, and I was over it.\nI was trying to cook dinner, plotting against the irritating insects in the interim as the pasta boiled and the sauce simmered. I was annoyed—and not just at the state of my kitchen, but at what seemed to be the state of my life. Why couldn’t I just get it all under control already?  \nThat’s when David walked in.\nI married a good man. He is kind and gracious and funny. And when he walked in the door during my fruit-fly and general-life crisis, I did what any human being would do: I let him have it.\nI was as passive-aggressive as I knew how to be and then some. I started slyly with some innocent questions, and then I went in for the kill, attacking his actions and decisions and, in the end, his character. It was awful. I was awful.\nHere is what I cannot for the life of me understand: I had no desire to treat my husband with such unkindness and disrespect. I did not stand there in my kitchen, stirring that spaghetti sauce and thinking, When he gets home, I’m going to give him a piece of my mind. Honestly, I don’t know that I’ve ever thought that about him.\nI love David. And I love how he loves me. I want nothing but the absolute best for him. But my best intentions were not calling the shots that night. My humanity was.\nI’m so grateful for this passage in Romans 7. I’m grateful that God not only knows us fully, but He reassures us of this in His Word. I’m grateful for Paul’s confession that so clearly articulates the struggle I feel in my own heart on a daily basis.\nI don’t want to sin. Really, I don’t. But I do it anyway.  \nI want to obey the Lord. Really, I do. But I disobey anyway.\nPaul’s description of his own sin struggle in Romans 7:14-25 can seem confusing at first read. But read it again, slowly this time. Read it aloud. Do you hear the desperation? Paul, like me (and like you?), does not want to sin. But in and of himself—in his “flesh”—he does not have the ability to be sinless. And he seems pretty frustrated about this. I am, too. Aren’t you?\nSin is a disease we are born with but cannot heal. Sin is a slavery we are born into but cannot escape (Romans 3:23; 1 Corinthians 15:22).\nSin is a condition we cannot fix. But Jesus can. He has.\nThe message of the gospel of Jesus—the gospel that causes Paul to cry, mid-frustration, “Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (v.25)—is that Jesus has rescued us from “this body of death” (v.24). We are more than just our weak-willed bodies; we are souls who have been redeemed by the sinless life and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\nYes, we struggle with sin. We struggle to “keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:25), to choose a moment-by-moment life guided by the Spirit of the Lord rather than our selfish desires. But we do not struggle in vain. Our struggle is a fight—a fight to live in the freedom that has already been secured by the Savior who defeated darkness once for all (1 Corinthians 15:55-57).\nThanks be to God, for He invites us into a life governed not by our wants or our whims, but by His truth and love.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 8:1-17, Isaiah 53:10, Mark 14:32-36\nIndoor plumbing was a luxury in the Haitian village where my adopted daughter, Missy, grew up. And soft, two-ply toilet paper—that was even more rare. When I brought her home to Tennessee, flushing the toilet with copious amounts of Charmin quickly became one of her favorite pastimes.\nHow darling!\nThat was my thought in those early days as I observed her wide-eyed delight at watching massive plumes of paper spiral downward. But after a while, wading through ankle-deep wastewater in my bathroom and writing large checks to repairmen lost its allure.\nSo I was at my wit’s end a couple months ago when I walked into my bathroom—past my innocent-looking daughter splashing in a bubble bath—slipped on the wet tile, and quickly discovered water gushing out of the commode like Niagara Falls. After a heavy sigh, I morphed into the put-upon persona my mother used when I did something especially naughty as a child:\nDoggone it, Missy, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU not to use giant gobs of toilet paper like this?!\nI angrily set about cleaning up the mess. The entire time I was plunging and fussing and mopping up that yucky pond with beach towels, I had my back turned to Missy.\nAs the water and my irritability subsided, I turned around to see my precious little girl staring at me mournfully, big tears streaming down her beautiful brown cheeks. I’d all but crushed her spirit over something innocent and insignificant. She wasn’t trying to cause a mess. She hadn’t been willfully disobedient or disrespectful. This was a plumbing issue—not a heart issue.\nI lifted her out of the tub, dried her off with our last dry towel, and rocked her back and forth until she stopped crying. I carefully explained that it was wrong for Mama to raise her voice, that I’d made a very bad choice, and that I was so sorry I’d hurt her feelings.\nThat night I called my contractor, who seemed perplexed when I asked, “Hey, Jack, you know those really powerful toilets on cruise ships that sound like they could suck your leg off when you flush them? Can you install one of those in my bathroom?”\nLess than forty-eight hours later, our brand-new supersonic vacuum version of a toilet was installed. I cheered so enthusiastically after Missy’s inaugural flush, you’d have thought she’d won an Olympic medal.\nOur recent toiletastrophes have reminded me just how much I love, value, and cherish my little girl. They’ve also reminded me of how God the Father loves, values, and cherishes me, His kid.\nI’m overwhelmed by the beautiful, redemptive ways He’s moved in my life. How He chose a former Haitian orphan, who lost her first mom to AIDS and never knew her biological father, to effectively rip out the last stubborn roots of the orphaned, fatherless spirit that have been growing in my own heart since long before I was Missy’s age.\nFor those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory\n(Romans 8:14-17, NIV).\nChildren. Heirs. Coheirs with Christ.\nGod continues to employ my unlikely, only-by-grace, position of motherhood as a constant, colorful illustration of how He cheers Himself hoarse over every ungainly cartwheel we do (Zephaniah 3:17). How He leans down and hangs on every word of our mostly narcissistic prayers. How—despite our proclivity to make huge messes—He is so completely for us.\n\nLisa Harper is a master storyteller with a masters of Theological Studies from Covenant Seminary. She’s lauded as an engaging, hilarious communicator as well as an authentic and substantive Bible teacher. She’s been in vocational ministry for 30 years and has written 15 books (her latest being, The Sacrament of Happy: What a Smiling God Brings to a Wounded World) and Bible study curriculums but says her greatest accomplishment by far is that of becoming Missy’s (her adopted daughter from Haiti) mama!

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebekah Lyons\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 8:18-25, Isaiah 65:17, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Revelation 21:1-6\nIt begins as far back as we can remember. Right before we run off to school, we smear on our mama’s lip gloss and clamp down as many hair clips as our endless bangs will allow. We hope for another attempt to fit in with the others, to measure up, to belong.\nGrowing up, I often found myself hanging in the balance between enjoying the moment and anticipating the next one. As a young child, my hopes centered around a 25-cent soft serve ice cream cone after church on Sunday nights. My hopes matured as I did—working to make the swim team, racing to the finish line at a track meet, striving to win an award. I hoped for slumber party invitations, a certain new sweater for Christmas and, of course, beating my brother at checkers.\nThose early years of putting my best foot forward, I hoped the appearance of having it all together would win me friends. But years down the line, the stakes of life loomed larger, and deep heartache entered in—nevermind the lip gloss or hair clips.\nIn truly tragic moments, our hope is put to the test. And if it’s misplaced, it will be found wanting. \nThe hope we read about in Romans offers us a greater understanding of the hope God offers. It takes us from tangible evidence we can see, and pushes us deeper into a faith that asks for what we cannot see. In fact, all of creation is wired for this. If something breaks, we are hardwired to figure out a solution. Most problems can’t be solved in a day, so we work and test and try until we receive the desired outcome. But there will always be a hope offered by God that requires all of Him, and no amount of our working and testing will bring it to pass. This is the hope of Christ, our Rescuer and Redeemer.\nBecause of Christ, we are free to hope in even the most difficult or uncertain circumstances. In the first chapter of his epistle, James tells us to “consider it a great joy” whenever we face trials because the testing of our faith produces spiritual endurance (vv. 2-3). Trials are accompanied by hope. Hope is a gift. Hope is critical, and the gospel gives it to us in unending supply.\nNow in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience (Romans 8:24-25).\nAny suffering we endure here and now is incomparable to God’s coming glory (Romans 8:18). The measure of trials we have endured directly relates to the measure of hope we offer the world. This is the beautiful gift of hope.\nOne day our groans will give way to glory. While we wait, we place our hope in Jesus.\nHe will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away (Revelation 21:4).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 8:26-39, Psalm 44:17-22, Philippians 1:6, 2 Thessalonians 2:14\nI hope your summer fun list includes a trip to an amusement park or two. Nothing gets the blood pumping quite like circling a track at 100 miles per hour while simultaneously crying, laughing, and screaming. That’s good stuff.\nBut before you fill the water bottles and load the kids into the minivan for a day of sweltering, screaming fun, I need to let you in on a secret your brain already knows.\nIt starts with a feeling sociologists call “museum feet.” It’s a phenomenon our brains experience when we’re in a big space like an amusement park or a museum. It’s a general sense of being lost or exhausted that comes from hanging out in such a large space.\n“Museum feet” could give park-goers a bad experience, causing them to leave the park and not return. But architects have learned that if they include a large visual landmark, we’re less likely to become overwhelmed. They’re looking out for us, and their bottom line, by ensuring we’re willing to stay on the grounds long enough to fork over the cash for overpriced lemonade and nachos.\nThink about it: Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World. Spaceship Earth at Epcot Center. The 150-foot “Big Wheel” Ferris wheel at Six Flags. Each offers their own brand of fun, sure, but they also give a reference point to come back to, something to focus on when we feel overwhelmed, overtired, or just over it.\nPaul never made it to Disney World, but he must’ve known a thing or two about feeling anxious, overwhelmed, or disoriented. Here, in Romans chapter 8, he shoots up a flare of truth for the believer to come back to every time we feel the same.\nAnd we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28).\nIf this is one of those feel-good verses that’s become so familiar you’re tempted to race past it—STOP. This is the mother lode, friends! If God can use all things for our good and His glory, nothing can knock us off kilter. He makes us sure-footed. It’s the kind of steady posture that caused Paul to restate the truth of Romans 8:28 for the church in Philippi.\nI am sure of this, that he who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus (Philippians 1:6).\nPaul is describing the process of redemption—that supernatural metamorphosis whereby God makes all things new. Paul was so anchored in the gospel that no wind could capsize him. That’s not new news, but this may be: the steadiness of Paul is possible for us too.\nGod’s promise in Romans 8:28 means He’s already at work, reshaping everything for our good. Tribulation, persecution, famine—God can redeem all of these and more (v.35). Nothing can stop the redemption process (vv.38-39). Not death, not life, not angels or rulers. Not this moment or all the tomorrows to come. Nothing can stop God from working all things for good—not even you.\nLife is big. It’s easy to feel lost or overwhelmed or like we want off the ride, but God’s truth anchors us against museum feet. The story of redemption gives us a point to come back to when we feel alone or afraid. The next time you feel overwhelmed, overtired, or just plain over it, look up.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 9:1-19, Exodus 32:30-32, Ephesians 1:3-6\nYou’ve probably been there—that terrible moment when you feel like you’re watching a train about to wreck. Your roommate chooses to stay in a toxic relationship. Your child makes a series of self-destructive decisions. Your brother or sister persists in a state of total denial. Your friend walks away from God.\nHelplessness is a special kind of agony, especially when it comes to our loved ones. This is the agony Paul expresses in Romans 9 about the choices of Israel. Having had his eyes opened to the light of the gospel, Paul realizes with great anguish that many of his people—God’s people—have not awakened to the good news of Jesus Christ. Theologian N. T. Wright describes Paul’s reaction this way: “[Paul] was like someone driving in convoy who takes a particular turn in the road and then watches in horror as most of the other cars take the other fork.”\nPaul’s sorrow is so great that he would rather take their place: “I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the benefit of my brothers and sisters” (v.3). This chapter, then, is not a cold, calculating explanation of Israel’s history and fate. Instead, Paul is wrestling with the mysterious ways of God, and he doesn’t arrive at many neat and tidy conclusions.\nIn Romans 9, Paul engages some complex theological questions, but if we zoom in a bit and look at his heart, we might recognize our own. Most of us have walked in Paul’s shoes—grieving the rebellion, blindness, or self-destruction of someone we love. From Paul’s own wrestling with heartache, we can discern two spiritual principles:\n1. None of us can boast. None of us stands on moral high ground. God’s grace was not extended to us on the basis of human merit, but divine mercy. That is the principle Paul points to throughout the history of Israel: Isaac, not Ishmael; Jacob, not Esau. These men, these chosen ones who constituted the line of Abraham, were not selected because of their outstanding moral character, but because of the free compassion of God. As Paul explains, “It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy” (v.16). In other words, none of us can pat ourselves on the back for our good choices or our strong faith, while silently judging others. It is all a gift, so that none of us should boast.\n2. God is sovereign. The relationship between God’s power and our free will is a mysterious one, indeed. But when it comes to the decisions of a loved one, God’s sovereignty removes a great deal of weight from our shoulders. Namely, we cannot force someone to make the right choice. We cannot yell someone into wisdom. We cannot wrestle someone into agreeing with us. And we cannot compel transformation. There is only One who directs the streams of human hearts, and that is God alone.\nThe sovereignty of God does not permit us to become callous, nor does it permit complacency. Like Paul, we should mourn destruction whenever we encounter it. But it can relieve us of a burden we were never meant to bear.\nOnly God knows the whole picture and the entire story. Our task is to share the good news to the best of our ability, in humility, and then prayerfully leave the rest to Him.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 9:20-33, Jeremiah 18:1-6, Ephesians 1:11-14\nI did an internship in Washington D.C. the summer before my junior year in college. The job was good enough; I coordinated summer camp logistics for kids interested in politics. Yes, it was as nerdy as you’re imagining, and yes, I was a former attendee. But the best thing about that summer wasn’t licking envelopes and herding hormones. It was meeting a new group of friends at church.\nI don’t know if you’re familiar with the town of Stars Hollow from the TV show Gilmore Girls, but those quirky, fictional characters had nothing on my new, real-life friends. Despite the fact that I was a stranger in town, and only planning to stay for eight weeks, they grafted me in, constantly hounding me to join them for weekend adventures of camping, floating down rivers, or taking long motorcycle rides through the Shenandoah Valley. It was as dreamy as it sounds, and healing for my soul in many, many ways.\nWe talked about the gospel, too, and one of those conversations led to the topic of the providence of God—what some call “predestination.” The candor of the conversation shocked me. Who talks about this stuff anyway? And what does the providence of God even mean?\nI was kindly pointed to today’s passage in Romans, and from there one friend explained the idea that God knows, plans, and orchestrates everything. All the days ordained for me (and you, for that matter) were written in His book before one of them came to be (Psalm 139:16). We are God’s workmanship created to do good works that He prepared in advance for us to do (Ephesians 2:10). Salvation itself is a righteousness that comes by faith, and even that comes from Him.\nAt face value, the concept that God is in control of everything might seem offensive. We humans have a cosmic authority problem. We don’t like to believe that Someone else has the final say in our lives. When Paul asks in Romans 9:20, “Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’”, I want to scream, “Yes! That’s what my prayers to God sound like on a regular basis!” But if we are to take Romans 9 to heart, we have to concede that God is ultimately the one in control of His creation.\nIn the years since my dream summer in D.C., I’ve learned a lot about faith. I’ve read much more of the Bible. I’ve spent countless hours with Jesus. And despite all that, God’s providence is as mysterious to me now as it was then. But I do know this: I would rather believe in a loving God who is fulfilling His purpose for me, than a cosmic universe that is inflicting its chaos on me.\nI look at the seasons, coming and going in their time. I look at the ocean waves, which know their boundaries. I look at my face in the mirror—imperfect, yes, but a masterpiece in the Master’s hands. I look at the miracles of birth and life and death. None of it is a mistake. This beauty is His creation, and He is sovereign.\nIf we trust Him—if we believe His love—we can put away our questions of Why did you make me like this? and put on the posture of Thy will be done.\n\n Claire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Missy Fuller\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 10:1-21, Isaiah 52:7, Joel 2:32, Galatians 3:7-14\nI sat on the plush, cream-colored sofa, helping my mentor fold laundry while her two-year-old played on the floor. I was a senior in college, involved in campus ministry and leading a Bible study, and I enthusiastically updated her on both endeavors. I’d begun telling yet another story when she calmly interrupted me with a simple, matter-of-fact statement: “You believe in a works-based gospel.” \nWe’d known each other a while, and her statement stunned me. Was she serious? \nI quickly brushed it off in the moment. But later that week, I found myself kneeling by the side of my bed, soaking my plaid, purple bedspread with tears. She was right. \nThere I was, wallowing in my sin, wanting desperately to be back in the loving arms of my Savior. I had asked for forgiveness, but the relief wasn’t coming. As I poured my guilty conscience onto the pages of my journal, I was struck by one word: time.\nThat’s what I thought I needed: time. I didn’t really want forgiveness. I wanted time—enough time to fill my life up with the right things, the good things, to settle the score. It was salvation by works at its worst. \nAll my striving, all my desire to put time between myself and my mistakes, it was another attempt to earn my salvation through my own effort. Rather than trusting the work of Christ on the cross for my righteousness, I had become dependent on my own actions to save me.\nI was living exactly like the Israelites Paul describes in Romans 10:\nSince they are ignorant of the righteousness of God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to God’s righteousness (v. 3).\nAfter Christ’s death and resurrection, Israel was still working hard to keep the Law of Moses in order to gain righteousness. They were working to save themselves, forgetting that “Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes” (v. 4). \nThe law, our works, the right things—they were never supposed to save us. God had planned our salvation and redemption through Jesus Christ all along. Christ is the only perfect fulfillment, the only victory we have over sin and death. His perfect life allows us to be justified through our faith alone. Faith and nothing else, just Jesus—this is the message of Christ.\n“For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (v. 13). \nAs I knelt beside my bed that day, I realized Jesus truly was all I needed. His sacrifice covered me then, despite all my striving, and it covers me today. I need His righteousness, not my own. He is enough. \nFriends, no matter what our past, present, or future holds, the only work that can save us is the work Christ completed on the cross. May we call on His name.\nOne believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation (v. 10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 11:1-24, Hosea 14:4-7, Ephesians 2:8-9\nThe first time I read Romans 11, I saw God as very kind. \nBut today, that kindness seems far away—30,000 miles below me, to be exact. This time, I’m reading Romans from seat 12B, squished between two strangers. And the pilot has just warned us that “significant turbulence” is ahead. \nA hush fell over the cabin in that awkward “I’m playing it cool” kind of way. Because it’s totally going to be fine. I mean, how likely is that whole “unlikely” in-case-of-an-emergency situation, anyway?\nWe’re all eyeing the flight attendants to gauge their uneasiness.\nJust when you’ve settled into your seat and become comfortable with God’s kindness, the winds shift. His tender mercies can also feel severe. Regardless of how much we show it, we’re all afraid of crashing.\nThe Romans were afraid of this too. After all, Israel had taken a hard fall following God’s rejection, so it only seemed natural for this band of new believers to begin bracing themselves for a similar emergency landing. They were afraid that if God didn’t turn out to be who He said He was, they’d have to take matters into their own hands. \nIt’s in moments like these that sweet songs about God’s kindness and goodness do not trump the truth about His severity. Just like we need the fullness of God’s character, we need to know the fullness of His Truth.\nAlthough the pilot reassures us that everything is under control, I’m tempted to entertain anxious questions. Did they check the plane to make sure it was safe before we boarded? Is the pilot keeping something from us? Is everything really just fine?\nWhen bad things happen that we don’t understand, are we just naïve to keep hoping? Will God reject us like He rejected Israel? It’s when we face the unknown that we find out how well we trust God’s character… which brings me to Jello.\nCreated by pilot and therapist Captain Tom Bunn to illustrate turbulence, the Jello Exercise compares a plane’s high-traveling, air-thickening speeds to being encased in Jello. While turbulent bumps may make you feel like you’re falling from the sky, it’s actually more like tapping the top of a Jello mold: the plane can bounce up and down, but it cannot fall. In fact, it barely moves at all. Regardless of the bumps, the plane is sustained, completely, by a force we can’t even see. \nSo are God’s people.\n“Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, though a wild olive branch, were grafted in among them and have come to share in the rich root of the cultivated olive tree, do not boast that you are better than those branches. But if you do boast—you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you” (Romans 11:17-18).\nIt is by grace that we cannot fully comprehend what it takes to sustain us. Not only does God know exactly what it takes, but in His kindness He sent Jesus to endure the severity for us. When love isn’t taken lightly, grace must also be severe.\nIt takes an intense, thickening wind to keep a plane steady in the clouds. It takes a kind, severe God to sustain us for His glory. Today, He is not only kind, but also severe, and exactly Who we need.\n“The people will return and live beneath his shade. They will grow grain and blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon” (Hosea 14:7).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 11:25-36, Isaiah 40:13-15, 1 Corinthians 12:4-11\nPerhaps you’ve heard the not-so-fairy-tale-like stories of the children of Israel. Like the one where God rescued them from slavery, and they responded by grumbling about the flavors missing from their menu (Numbers 11). Or the one where they got impatient with Moses as he met with God on Mt. Sinai, so they decided to worship a golden calf (Exodus 32). Or the time when they came to the border of the promised land and listened to their knees knocking and hearts racing, instead of listening to the voice of God (Numbers 13).\nWhen we flip forward in our Bibles to the New Testament, we find God’s people still stuck in the ruts of rejection and rebellion. It was, after all, the Jewish leaders who led the charge to have Jesus arrested, tried, convicted, and crucified (Matthew 26:3-5). After the resurrection, they remained resolute in their opposition of Jesus, doing everything in their power to squelch the message of the Church. \nYet here in Romans 11, Paul reminds us that despite their chronic grumbling and wilderness wandering, despite their golden calf worshipping and Savior scourging, the Jewish people remain God’s “beloved” (v. 28). \nOur human logic may balk at this, but Paul warns against trusting only what makes sense to our brains (Romans 11:25). Try as we might, we cannot understand God’s love using our flawed standards for love and acceptance. Chapter after chapter, verse after verse, the story of God’s commitment to His chosen people doesn’t make sense. Human understanding leaves us wondering, Why did God choose them? But through the lens of the gospel, the story of the Jews suddenly makes sense. Look at Deuteronomy 7:6-8.\n“For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth” (v. 6).  \nLean in. Listen closely to this next part. \n“It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all the peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath he swore to your fathers. . .” (vv. 7-8).\nGod knew His beloved were weak and frail—incapable of keeping their side of the covenant. Still He chose them, loves them, and keeps His promises to them. \nThe Bible is not the story of a wayward people but of a faithful God. \nIn the shadow of the cross, we are God’s chosen people. Because of the gospel, our identity has been changed from “not my people” to “my people” (Romans 9:25). Christ’s sacrifice made a way for us to be among the “beloved.” The gifts God has lavished upon us are so extravagant, and we are so undeserving, that we sometimes worry He’ll take them back. But “God’s gracious gifts and calling are irrevocable” (Romans 11:29). \nThe depth of God’s wisdom is matched only by the depth of His love. He has promised unfathomable gifts to us and He will never snatch them back. If every one of God’s acts of love and faithfulness toward the Jewish people could be contained, they’d overflow the seas. We, too, can stand on the shore and see the unmistakable faithfulness of God. \nWe are weak.\nWe are wayward. \nAnd yet, the Prince and the kingdom are irrevocably ours.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 12:1-8, Hebrews 13:15-16, Ephesians 4:1-16\nPersonal discipline isn’t one of my stronger giftings. To put it another way, I stink at it.\nI’m the one in my family who excitedly asks, “Who wants to go get ice cream?” rather than stick to our sensible meal plan. I’m notorious for drafting a shiny new routine that lasts for three days before I’m ready for spontaneity again. Despite my best efforts to implement structure in my life, I’m all over the place. I’ve come to accept that flexibility is just part of who God made me to be.\nBut here’s the truth. For me, that acceptance spills over into a lack of spiritual discipline. The world tells us that fulfilling our every desire or whim in the moment is a sign of happiness, success, and freedom. But I can say from experience that ignoring spiritual disciplines only leads to chains, not freedom.\nPaul warns us, “Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,” and I find myself staring longingly at his words (Romans 12:2). I want that. I want my body—my whole self—to be “a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God” (v. 1).\nI tried renewing my mind by attending church, but I didn’t make time to engage with God at home. I’d sit half-dazed in front of my computer, reading about fall fashion trends rather than reading my Bible. I’d watch one more episode of my favorite show and skip my prayer time. I wanted to read my Bible and pray and live out Romans 12:2, but my propensity for distraction and gluttony grew. I couldn’t control them on my own, no matter how guilty I felt or how many times I vowed to change.\nI’d forgotten that only God can transform my heart. And that transformation takes place in the context of the body of Christ, His Church—not just out here on my own, accompanied only by my best intentions.    \nMaybe your struggle is the opposite of mine, and routine and productivity are the desires that take the place of true renewal. Or perhaps your days are bound by a structure that you don’t want God to bend, a rigidity where spending time with Him in Scripture and in prayer are items on a checklist rather than intimate interaction with your heavenly Father. Whatever your personality, spiritual disciplines are tools that lift our eyes from our circumstances and desires and focus our hearts on God’s presence. Prayer, fasting, Bible study—they’re all disciplines that renew our minds and refresh our spirits. But unlike a resolution, a diet, or an exercise regimen, they aren’t sustained by our willpower.\nTrue spiritual growth is rooted in the Spirit’s work in us, not in our effort. God is the Giver. We are the recipient. He empowers. We surrender. We do this individually, as God’s daughters and sons, and we do this corporately, as His children and Church.\nMay we truly worship the Lord today by offering Him our whole selves, surrendering our desires to His will and our efforts to His strength, “according to the grace given to us” (Romans 12:6). Amen.\n\nJill McDaniel is a northern girl who married a southern gentleman and settled in the Midwest.

Rid your life of hypocrisy. Love deeply. Outdo one another in showing honor. Do not lack diligence in zeal. Share with the saints. Pursue hospitality. Live at peace with everyone…\nWith everyone? Really?\nDude. Paul. I need some coffee. And also, when am I supposed to binge-watch my TV shows?\nIn all honesty, when I compare my life to the lives of the disciples, I begin to see why Paul fills 1 Corinthians 4:6-13 with so much irony. I practically live like a queen compared to Christ’s beloved friends back in the day, and compared to much of the world today. Most of my time is spent concerned about how I’ll choose to spend my time.\nI catch myself daydreaming about the life the world tells me I should have: a life with a passionate (never rocky) marriage to my soulmate, a clean and immaculate house, a career that’s advancing, children that are thriving, and plenty of time at the gym maintaining the body of a teenager. To top it off, the world tells me I need to portray this “perfect” life to the world on social media, to attract more followers.\nWith this world as my guide, adding Paul’s list to the mix is absolutely impossible. There are not enough hours in the day to do both what the world demands of me and what God desires for me. And so I have to choose.\nEvery single day I have to choose whom I will serve: my flesh or my God. Some days I make the right choice. Some days I make the wrong one. This is the life of a work in progress, one that God promises to bring to completion in His time (Philippians 1:6).\nPerhaps that’s why Paul tells us to “cling to what is good” (Romans 12:9). If good was an easy, simple thing to hold onto, why would he tell us to cling to it? I know that in my own life, if I’m not clinging to God, the natural inclination of my heart is one of jealousy, coveting, and destructive daydreams. So while it seems like what Paul is cautioning us to do should be obvious, I know it to be oh-so difficult to put into practice. Detest what is evil; cling to what is good. I know that If I’m clinging to something, then I’m desperate, grasping. I’m holding on for dear life.\nThese passages remind me that my very life is at stake, and that evil really is evil. Paul pokes at my carefully built life, reminding me that Christ’s path of goodness and stillness and quietness is the only route to peace. I can rest knowing that the battle is the Lord’s. But I can’t assume that rest and peace will come without effort on my part, without my choosing God. I must cling to Him and let go of everything else.\nDear Lord, help me to hold on.\n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 13:1-14, Daniel 2:19-23, Hebrews 11:32-40\nThe Bible is filled with the stories of people who have defied authority. Moses stood up to Pharaoh then led the Israelites out of Egypt. Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego all refused to worship any other god but Yahweh—and were then thrown into the lions’ den and fiery furnace, respectively. (Spoiler alert: God saved them all, and for His glory.)\nStephen defied the ruling Jewish Council, preached the gospel of Jesus, and was stoned to death for it. Paul and other apostles were martyred by the Roman government during the persecution of Christians.\nAnd yet this same Paul, who likely later died at the hands of his government, urges believers to honor and respect those in authority. Paul—who knew many examples throughout Jewish history of standing up to corrupt rulers—says to obey, seemingly without question. What are we to make of this?\nOf course, it’s natural to wonder, What if the government was urging murder, stealing, or some other form of not loving one’s neighbor? What if the ruling authorities were, as Nebuchadnezzar did, asking their people to bow down to another god? Or no god at all?\nScripture has given us plenty of evidence that Christ is the ultimate authority in heaven and on earth. Paul isn’t contradicting that here. What he is doing in Romans 13, is laying down a foundation for Christian living—reminding us that our ultimate authority is Jesus. Our first and truest loyalty is to Him.\nPeter gives a similar exhortation in 1 Peter 2. After telling the people, “you are a chosen race, a holy priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession” (v. 9), he says:\nSubmit to every human authority because of the Lord, whether to the emperor as the supreme authority or to governors as those sent out by him to punish those who do what is evil and to praise those who do what is good… Honor everyone. Love the brothers and sisters. Fear God. Honor the emperor (vv. 13-14,17).\nPeter starts by reminding believers of who they are: the body of Christ, a holy nation of God that extends beyond borders. This is a beautiful truth for us to cling to as well, especially in times of deep confusion, national partisanship, and turmoil within our own institutions.\nBoth Peter and Paul tell early Christians to honor their government, but they do so in the context of the whole story of Scripture (and their own writings), affirming that Jesus is Lord over all. Therefore, we obey the government when it doesn’t contradict God’s commands—and we do it joyfully, as a way of honoring God.\nJohn Piper says it this way: “And it is very important to stress that, just as we may have to disobey the civil authorities for Christ’s sake, so all our obedience should be for His sake as well. We never have two masters … Every time we say yes to any law, it should be a yes to Jesus.”\nOur every action should be motivated by our identity as followers of Christ and citizens of God’s kingdom:\nThe night is nearly over, and the day is near; so let us discard the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. Let us walk with decency, as in the daytime: not in carousing and drunkenness; not in sexual impurity and promiscuity; not in quarreling and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and don’t make plans to gratify the desires of the flesh (Romans 13:12-14).\nThe Bible offers many examples of what godly citizenship looks like in an earthly kingdom. Let us pray continually that we will seek first God’s Kingdom, listening to the promptings of the Holy Spirit as we engage thoughtfully with our own earthly governments. \n\nMelanie Rainer is the director of content for JellyTelly, where she writes and edits family spiritual formation resources.

There, I will hug everyone too many times, introduce friends who don’t already know one another, drink multiple Coke ICEEs, and maybe catch a foul ball. Then I will fall into bed tonight sure that I’m the luckiest woman alive.\nMy life is far from perfect. But the life I’ve spent 37 years putting together is turning out alright. Not perfect, not problem-free, but pretty awesome nonetheless.\nThe older I get, the more I draw boundaries in my life, making it the life I want to live. Some of my life rules wouldn’t work for you, and I’m okay with that. For starters, I’m dairy-free (it’s an allergy thing), but I wouldn’t ask you—or any of my friends at my birthday party—to live without milk, let alone eat cake WITHOUT ice cream. That beautiful stuff should never go to waste!\nThen there’s the matter of rest. My day off each week is almost always a Wednesday. That doesn’t mean it needs to be your weekly day to rest. It simply means Wednesdays work best for me.\nAnd then there’s the soccer. I watch it every chance I get. But you don’t have to do the same. Though, I’d highly recommend it because it’s just the best. Period.\n The beauty of maturing, and also growing up in my faith, is that I no longer want to look like you. In high school I wanted to look like you, sound like you, and like what you like. Not now. Now, I want to live MY life. I want to look like me—the best, healthiest, kindest, truest version of me. There’s this thing we get to do whenever we’re tired of comparing our lives to other people’s lives: we get to live our own.\n You know what it is? It’s the difference between bondage and freedom. Freedom is not a life without boundaries or borders or rule. It’s a life full of the good kind of boundaries, the kind that keep you healthy and strong, living the life God made you to live. It’s the life that is uniquely yours.\nFor none of us lives for himself, and no one dies for himself. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord (Romans 14:7-8).\nWe often think freedom as just wide open space. But I’ve never found that to be true. Real freedom is found in knowing Jesus. It is giving yourself permission to live wide open in the spaces where God has placed you and in the ways He has made you. My fences around my spaces are going to look different from yours, but there is such safety and health and permission inside the boundaries built just for you.\nScripture tells us that if we’re Christ-followers, then the life we get to live belongs to Him  anyway. Galatians 2:20 says, “The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.”\nThat right there—living for Jesus—is living your best life.\n \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 14:13-23, 1 Corinthians 8:8-13, Ephesians 4:25-32, Ephesians 5:1-2\nI’ve always heard this passage in Romans 14 interpreted according to clothing, music, alcohol, smoking, and more—all in terms of “not being a stumbling block for others.” I was tender to my power to be a stumbling block of every sort, both to the believing and the unbelieving, checking over my shoulder to see the carnage I’d left in my wake. Truth was, I left hardly any, but it didn’t stop me from metaphorically cutting off arms and legs, gouging out eyes and the like, in pursuit of protecting my brothers and sisters.\nThe Christian life, I thought, was more about what I couldn’t do than what I could.\nHow glorious, then, when the true gospel began to take root in my heart. I began to understand that freedom in Christ meant I was truly free to live. As it turns out, Christ had declared me more than clean. He’d declared me redeemed.\nFor all the ways I’d formerly applied this passage, though, the one I’d not considered was food. I knew all food had been declared clean, that we’re no longer under the law of Moses in our dietary restrictions. But what I didn’t understand was the law of our current world with regard to food: the diet and exercise industry. Everywhere I look, the acceptable Christian message of caring for the temple of the Holy Spirit turns into what I imagine Paul might’ve called the “god of the belly” (Philippians 3:19).\nIn Philippians 3, Paul warns of the dangers of gluttony. But today, in modern culture, the opposing god—though a no less despicable one—is the one who demands less food, more restrictions, better supplements, flatter stomachs, tighter abs, and the list goes on. In an attempt to care for the temples of the Holy Spirit with eating and exercising, we can destroy our bodies (which are wasting away, whether we like it or not) and cause harm to the impressionable hearts and minds of others who jump on every new regime or diet we offer.\nWe want to be well, to eat healthy, whole, good food. We love the rhythms of feasting and fasting we see in Scripture. We want to move our bodies, staying limber and active. But we don’t want to destroy our hearts by lusting after what we don’t have: slimmer physiques and sculpted thighs. We don’t want to destroy our bodies by rebounding from one quick-fix supplement to another. We don’t want to destroy our minds by believing our approval comes from certain lifestyles or appearances.\nThere are countless difficulties in life, opportunities to be divided over race, gender, theology, and history. And food, instead of becoming a means to crush those divides—to draw near to one another, armed with soups, fruits, breads, vegetables, and meats—has become one more line of division.\nChrist died for all; this is what the Bible says. I don’t want to be known by what I eat or don’t eat. I want to be known by how I love and Who I’m loved by.\nSo then, let us pursue what promotes peace and what builds up one another. Do not tear down God’s work because of food (Romans 14:19-20).\nWhatever struggle you’re caught in the throes of today, know that you are loved by Christ. He spread His own body, bleeding and broken, to fit a cross you could never bear on your own. Don’t destroy your own body by what you do or don’t eat. Christ died for all—every curve, every bulge, and every stretch-mark—all of it.\nFor “the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit” (Romans 14:17). God gives us food as a means of provision, not division. Instead of fostering false divisions today, let’s bake a cake, make a soup or a sandwich, and share it with someone in the pursuit of peace.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 15:1-21, 2 Samuel 22:50-51, Psalm 117:1-2\nSome of my fondest memories as a kid include long summer days spent at the pool. These memories are filled with flipping off the diving board, shouting “Marco Polo,” and of course, playing King of the Mountain. The goal of King of the Mountain was to be the only one on top of the raft, ruling your kingdom by any means necessary. Growing up with brothers, I had to be scrappy and strategic to win at this brutal game. From a young age, I learned that only the strong survive.\nI’m told that as a grown-up, it’s not cool to push people off rafts at the pool. The thing is though, we still want to be on top. We just have different rafts now, and we’ve learned to defend our turf in more covert, “polite” ways. \nSo much of how we respond has to do with the season we’re in. When we’re treading water, we hope and pray for a gracious hand to help us onto the raft. But when we’re on top, it’s easy to become prideful in our position. It gets especially ugly when we believe there isn’t enough room on the raft for everyone. Even in the Church, we can foster the belief that the kingdom of God only has space for the “good” people, whether we’re conscious of it or not. \nIn our reading for today, Paul was writing to a Roman church comprised of two very different people groups: the Jews and the Gentiles. Even from its earliest days, it seems there were divisions amongst the believers in that region. Those who were “strong” didn’t want to help those they considered weak. But Paul challenged the Romans to accept one another, just as Christ had accepted them (Romans 15:7).\nPaul points out that even the strongest among us, Jesus Christ, did not use His power to please Himself. If anybody had a right to boast it was the Lord, yet He took our weakness upon Himself to the point of sacrificing His very life. \nWe are all in need of God’s grace. In that humility we can seek to be like Jesus, freely passing on the strength and encouragement that has been gifted to us. If the Lord of the universe humbled Himself and bore our weaknesses, how much more eager should we be to do the same for those whom He’s placed around us?\nIn addition to following the sacrificial example of Jesus, Paul also calls the Roman church to accept one another for the glory of God. When we’re competitive and exclusive in our churches, how do you suppose we’re seen from the outside? Our witness is compromised by our selfishness. But if we’re a countercultural people and can demonstrate with love and sincerity that there is room at the table of God, then we will have something divinely different to offer.\nIt’s tempting to believe the lie of this world, that we must fight to be on top. But in the kingdom of God there is always enough for everyone. As believers, we’re called to lay down our lives for others just as Christ did, to love both the strong and the weak. If we stop trying to protect our little rafts, together we will glorify and join in celebration with the one true King, who lives and reigns over all the mountains. \n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 15:22-33, Isaiah 52:14-15, Hebrews 2:2-4\nI like to know what’s coming—what could happen and what my options are. I think constantly about what works and what doesn’t. In short, plans are my jam.\nIn my final year of seminary, a job opportunity arose. It was one of those really great, safe jobs that worked in all the practical ways. I would have a plan—in case, you know, God didn’t come through. I walked through the interview process until the final meeting, when we were to discuss terms for my employment. That morning I confessed to God that I was more concerned about my five-year plan than His plans for me. Then I did what I knew I had to do: I walked into that last interview and said, “This is just not where I need to be.” \nAt first, I felt amazing, like that scene in The Devil Wears Prada where Anne Hathaway throws her cell phone into the fountain. Life felt extraordinary, like I was jumping off of the proverbial cliff of my ordinary, planned-out life into the unknown. Later, as I sat alone, it hit me: I had no backup plan and only a few months until graduation. Panic set in, and I did what most of us do in crisis. I told absolutely no one that I was struggling.\nOne Sunday, my friend Laura cornered me at church. She barely had to acknowledge the look on my face before I spilled my doubts and fears of being a failure and a fool. I felt shame. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t even know how I was going to buy groceries that week.\nLaura didn’t miss a beat. She saw past the facade and grabbed my arm, looked me in the eye and said, “I don’t have an answer for you. But I can tell you that God is with you. Even when you can’t believe that, I’ll believe it for you.” Laura reminded me of the blessing that is mine as a follower of Jesus—a peace greater than my plans. \nPaul’s life was filled with adventure and excitement (think: shipwrecks and jail time) but he, too, was created for community. In Romans 15:23-24, he writes, “I have strongly desired for many years to come to you whenever I travel to Spain. For I hope to see you when I pass through and to be assisted by you for my journey there, once I have first enjoyed your company for a while.” In these moments we catch glimpses of Paul’s ordinary life, even in the midst of extraordinary journeys. \nI imagine he felt lonely at times. I wonder if part of him didn’t want to admit his own struggles. \nIn a moment of need, I didn’t even have the words to ask my friend to pray for me. But Paul’s letter reminds me that gospel community is the life we’re called to. Paul knew firsthand that when we experience fellowship within the body of Christ, we are experiencing the very kingdom of God. “I know that when I come to you,” he said to his fellow believers in Rome, “I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ” (Romans 15:29). Then he asked for their prayers. \nMay we be a people who confess aloud how much we need Jesus, and push one another back into His presence. We don’t simply write postcards from a distance and wish one another luck or prosperity. No, we have the honor of inviting each other to encounter the living God, the giver of salvation and peace.\n\nMelissa Zaldivar is a social in the world of academics and an academic in the world of socials.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 16:1-16, John 13:16, 1 Peter 5:14\nOf all of the roles I’ve had in my life, my least favorite, without a doubt, is “new girl.” \nShe’s clumsy and uncertain, always draining her phone battery with GPS directions to the grocery store and back home again. With brave intentions and shy tendencies, she’s perfected the art of introducing herself, yet allows her next-door neighbor to call her the wrong name yet again. She doesn’t know when trash pickup is or where to find the office break room. And her best friend, states away, knows she’s always on call for both late night and early morning pep talks.\nI’ve been the new girl enough times to know what makes her feel welcome. Paul has a pretty good idea, too. After all, he could have easily ended the book of Romans with chapter 15, one of the biggest mic-drop opportunities of all time. Instead, he reintroduces us to the gift God gave us in each other. \nAfter “amen,” Paul continues on with a crucial reminder: we are not alone. He introduces us to his friends by name, explaining their significance and telling us why we’ll love them. \nPhoebe, whom Paul reminds us is already our sister, is on her way to Rome (and may be the one carrying his letter!). He encourages us to befriend her and take care of her during her stay. Priscilla and Aquila, more dear friends, put themselves on the line for our buddy Paul. So, of course, we’re honored to greet them and their church. The list goes on and on, and as it grows, Paul continues to build up God’s people with encouragement, delivering each name as a lifeline to the full body.\nIn this intimate portrait of Paul and his fellow believers, we see a lasting truth: The body of Christ is a built-in reminder that redemption is an extraordinary reality for everyday people. \nIt’s easy to misread the Bible as “The Book of People Who Had It All Together,” when really, there’s only one Hero in this story. The simple truth is that we all need Jesus, and we all need each other. \nIn Romans, Paul emphasizes that God’s plan is good news. But his writing isn’t just for well-versed theologians—it’s for ordinary, faithful people living in small, unseen obedience. It’s for us. If you are in Christ, your name is written there among the greatness and glory of God’s plan.\nHere in our temporary home, we never stop being the new girl who needs to relearn grace and remember truth. But praise the Lord—we don’t have to do it alone. \nGreetings, friends. And peace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus (1 Peter 5:14).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 16:17-27, Matthew 7:15-20, Jude 24-25\nI took a personality test the other day, and I wasn’t thrilled with the results. It confirmed what I already knew: I avoid conflict like the plague. Put me in a tension-filled room and I’ll moonwalk away so fast, you’ll never even know I was there.\nI tell you this not to confirm that I was raised in the 80s (which I was), but so you’ll understand why I so desperately want to misinterpret today’s passage from Romans. I’ll show you what I mean.\nHere we’ve come to the close of the longest of Paul’s letters. We’ve heard him preach on sin and salvation, grace and faith, and now we’re leaning in to see how he’ll land the plane. What does one say to wrap up what would become known as the most comprehensive expression of the gospel in all of Scripture?\nHe begins his conclusion with a warning:\nNow I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who create divisions and obstacles contrary to the teaching that you learned. Avoid them… (Romans 16:17).\nThis is where my comfort-loving ears perk up. Steer clear of those who cause problems? Avoid conflict at all costs? If that’s what our friend Paul is selling, I’m buying in bulk. But he continues:\n…because such people do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites. They deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting with smooth talk and flattering words (v. 18).\nNo smooth-talkers allowed? Yep, works for me.\nIn my humanity, I want Paul’s words to leave me right where I am: a well-intentioned gal who doesn’t like to rattle or be rattled. I want a divine endorsement for a head-down, hands-off way of living. I want to look to the folks on my right and my left and say, I’m fine. You’re fine. Everything’s fine. In short, I want to read Paul’s words as permission rather than admonition.\nHe keeps writing:\nThe report of your obedience has reached everyone. Therefore I rejoice over you, but I want you to be wise about what is good, and yet innocent about what is evil. The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you (vv.19-20).\nCrushing evil is not a passive activity. Our holy and sovereign God is currently and constantly at work, overcoming darkness with light (John 5:17). As Christ followers, our work is not passive either. We are called to right doctrine and right living—to cling to Christ and to His gospel, shunning all false gods and gospels that beg our worship. This is Paul’s parting reminder.\nIt’s true that I’m predisposed to being a coaster—a person who’d rather stay the course than question questionable coordinates. But the gospel Paul presents in this letter is not a matter of right or left. It’s a matter of life and death. The mystery of Jesus Christ has been “revealed and made known through the prophetic Scriptures, according to the command of the eternal God” (Romans 16:26). Our Savior has come. He has opened the way to God, the rescue and restoration of our wrecked, restless souls.\nThe truth is, you and I are not fine. We “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). But in God’s great love and compassion, we have been “justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Romans 3:24). What’s more, “since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). \nThis is the gospel. This is our hope. \nThis is what we cling to, what we live by, what we fight for—to the glory of the One who created us, saved us, and calls us His own.\nTo the only wise God, through Jesus Christ—to him be the glory forever! Amen (Romans 16:27).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Daniel’s Captivity in Babylon",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nLast week my husband called to say goodbye to his 93-year-old grandmother. Her body is showing signs of fatigue, and her doctors have said she doesn’t have much time left. More than that, she can just sense it somehow.\nHe relayed the conversation to me afterward—how he told her would miss her, and how she said she loved him and called him “Doo-bug,” the name she gave him when he was a baby. I listened, the familiar ache in my chest of knowing that our time here is temporary, no matter how we like to pretend it isn’t. What must it feel like to know the transition to heaven is near—to look back over nearly a century of celebration and sorrow, wars and babies, grandchildren and church potlucks and conversations on the front porch? What does success look like from that vantage point? What does it mean to live a faithful life?\nIn the book of Daniel, we get an overview of one man’s life. This true story begins with God’s people, including young Daniel, being taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon (Daniel 1:2). Part of the king’s strategy was to take some of the most beautiful, wise, and noble into his own home and indoctrinate them in the ways of the Chaldeans. The Babylonians’ desire was to change everything about Daniel, from his name to the god he worships.\nThe book recounts Daniel’s roughly seventy years in exile. He will be a prophet, an interpreter of dreams, and a prisoner. He will fast, worship, and pray to the God of Israel under threat of his life. He will survive a den of hungry lions by Yahweh’s power and presence, and prophesy the glory of God’s eternal kingdom. And while we know Daniel was not perfect—he was human, a sinner in need of grace—we will get glimpses over these twelve chapters of what it looks like to live a faithful life in exile.\nWe, too, are exiles in this world, longing for the day when we will live at home in the presence of Christ our King. We are citizens of heaven, but we take up residence here for a time, called to represent God’s image on every stretch of the journey. As we wrestle with what it looks like to live a faithful life, we look past Daniel to the perfection of Jesus Christ. He is our example and our advocate, our just judge and righteous ruler.\nTo say this year has been disorienting is an understatement. But regardless of our times, our culture, or our circumstances, our God’s faithfulness endures and His character does not change (Hebrews 13:8). He is more than able to be our anchor in times like these. If we will turn to Him and choose His ways, He will help us to remain faithful in this life, looking forward to the day when we will no longer feel the exile of this world because we will be with Him in His eternal kingdom.\nLong live the King.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Alena Pitts\n\nDo you ever wonder what it means to be favored by God? Or do you ever think about what it looks like to have God’s hand on your life? I thought I knew, but the longer I live the more I realize my understanding of God’s favor is expanding.\nAt the age of ten, God granted me the opportunity to star in a Christian film called War Room. The movie was a box-office hit and has been viewed by millions of people all over the world. Two years later, God gave me the chance to write a three-book fictional series with my mom titled Lena in the Spotlight. Those books have sold thousands of copies all over the world as well.\nThese were two life-changing events that gave me the privilege of traveling all over the world to tell my story and share the hope of God. Now, at sixteen, I can easily look back and call that God’s favor.\nBut I need to be truly transparent and honest with you. When I was asked to write on this passage in the book of Daniel, I immediately felt unequipped and unworthy because there is more to my story.\nTwo years ago my beautiful mother unexpectedly passed away. She was my best friend. She was with me on the movie set, in my writing, and as I traveled sharing my story. Just two days before she died, we were speaking at a mother/daughter conference together. But then she left this earth really suddenly and entered into eternity. I was devastated. It was the most painful day of my life by far, and I still carry it with me.\nBut would you call me crazy if I called this God’s favor on my life? I wouldn’t have said that two years ago, but now I’m beginning to understand favor a bit differently, maybe more deeply.\nThink about it. Do you think Daniel wanted to leave his home country of Israel? Do you think he would have wanted to live in a land that wasn’t his, working for a king that wasn’t his, being asked to serve a god that wasn’t his? I imagine he was pretty saddened by how his life had changed so quickly. But with the blessing of time and perspective, we can see in our readings today how God’s favor was still with Daniel in all of that.\nAs devastating and heart-wrenching as reality can be, it can often be God’s favor. God’s favor could be anything He has done or allowed in your life in order to fulfill His ultimate purposes. And what is God’s purpose? That people would find Him in the midst of their lives, in their pain and struggle, and come to know that they are deeply loved by Him.\nWhat if, like Daniel, God wants to use your story to help others find Jesus? What if His favor can be found in the things that feel like blessings, as well as the things that are really hard? What if He wanted to use all of your life to show up in your story and lead others home to Him? Would you choose today to view all of it as His favor, working to fulfill His good purposes?\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nWhen my husband and I were debating where to attend grad school, I kept one prayer on repeat: “God, please make it abundantly clear where we should go.” I would have paid anything to know we were making the right decision as we logged thousands of miles on our car, traveling from state to state, and weighing pros and cons. Ultimately, God answered our prayer, just about as clearly as we could have hoped, and off to the midwest we went.\nBut I can count many, many more times in my life when I desperately prayed for a clear answer, and it felt like God met me with quiet and silence. Sometimes, God’s quiet feels empty and leaves me angry or desperate for answers. And sometimes God’s quiet feels like confidence, the kind of stillness that settles over a dark house at night, when you feel safe and at peace, but there is no sound.\nThe desire for a dream to be interpreted or for a sign to be made clear is everywhere in Scripture. Saul lost his kingship because of it (1 Samuel 13), Gideon tested God in a search for clarity (Judges 6), and even the Pharisees asked Jesus for a clear sign (Matthew 12).\nIn Daniel 2, King Nebuchadnezzar wanted a clear interpretation of his dream, and threatened all the wise men, magicians, seers, and sorcerers with death if they couldn’t provide him with that interpretation. Nebuchadnezzar was so troubled by his disturbing dreams and so desperate for answers, which we see in his willingness to reward or punish those who could potentially unlock it for him.\nBut no one could—no mystical prophet of the pagan gods, no wise man, no medium. The Chaldeans even declared, “What the king is asking is so difficult that no one can make it known to him except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals” (Daniel 2:11).\nBut Daniel, a wise man who knew the true and living God who did dwell with His people, had a different response. He called on the name of the Lord, who responded by giving Daniel a vision of both the king’s dream and its interpretation. Then “Daniel praised the God of the heavens” (Daniel 2:19), reciting a true and bold prayer, with promises still true for us today (vv.20–23).\nFor Nebuchadnezzar, for Daniel, and for us today—only God can unlock the mysteries of wisdom and understanding, because God is the true source of them. God answered Daniel’s prayer with abundant clarity, but He doesn’t always. Whether God writes His answer in the sky or (by our limited human understanding) seems to remain maddeningly silent, we can move forward with confidence and faith. The rest of Daniel’s story will testify to this truth and call us to a deeper knowledge of the God whose answers we can always trust.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Jen Yokel\n\nIt was a matter of life and death. A recurring dream disturbed King Nebuchadnezzar’s sleep night after night. He called for the Babylonian magicians and wise men to explain it, threatening them with execution if no one succeeded, but Daniel, a Judean exile known for his wisdom and dream interpretation, prayed until God revealed the answer. And one day, he made his appointment with the king.\nIt wasn’t exactly good news.\nEach night, the king dreamed of a colossal statue made of various materials, from a solid gold head to iron and clay feet. Suddenly, a stone breaks from a nearby mountain and collides with the statue’s feet, causing it to crumble. The stone then grows into “a great mountain [that] filled the whole earth” (Daniel 2:35).\n“Your Majesty, you are king of kings,” Daniel truthfully tells the emperor. “The God of the heavens has given you sovereignty, power, strength, and glory” (Daniel 2:37). But the statue is a grim prediction. Babylon is the head of gold. Other, lesser kingdoms will rise and fall. But God, the heavenly “revealer of mysteries” (v.47), doesn’t leave this kind of power in human hands forever. “The God of the heavens will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed” (v.44).\nDaniel is a book full of mysteries and symbolism, politics and miracles. Yet the core truth is hope for an indestructible kingdom built on justice and mercy. Over and over, Daniel’s humility and loyalty to the God of his forefathers is contrasted with the arrogance of kings. Though his gifts made him influential, we don’t see a man tempted to play the power game. You can imagine him walking through the palace, serving royalty, and telling the truth with a homesickness and hope in his heart that whispers, “Someday… Someday, God will make this right.”\nCenturies later, Paul, another gifted exile, wrote this from the shadow of the Roman empire: “Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, when he abolishes all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign until he puts all his enemies under his feet” (1Corinthians 15:24–25).\nPaul paints a vision of God abolishing any authority that isn’t His, even death’s. Every empire that rises will someday fall. A reign built on violence and power can never truly last before a new ruler comes and tears it apart. But we can trust that God is building a mountain to fill the earth. God’s kingdom has been inaugurated by Jesus’s death and resurrection, because after all, “The last enemy to be abolished is death” (1Corinthians 15:26).\nGod, revealer of mysteries, shares the kingdom’s secret through Jesus’s life and resurrection. Daniel only had part of the picture, but he still carried confidence in an eternal kingdom—one of peace, laying down your life for your friends, and pledging allegiance to the only King who will reign forever.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Delivered from the Fire",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Tameshia Williams\n\nCourage under fire. We often encounter situations that require us to stand up for our beliefs, even at the risk of loss. We speak up about an injustice. We blow the whistle on unethical behaviors at work. We refuse to endorse societal values that clash with the truth of God’s Word. We perform these acts of bravery, knowing they can result in loss of our jobs, our relationships, and even our social standing. The pressure to back down can be tempting.\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego understood this pressure and refused to let even the threat of death sway them. God had their complete trust; they placed their fate in His hand. When faced with the fiery furnace that was meant to be their death sentence, they declared, “But even if [God] does not rescue us, we want you as king to know that we will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up” (Daniel 3:18). What a bold proclamation from these three young men in the presence of such a powerful king! They chose faith in God over fear of a human king. No matter how intense Nebuchadnezzar made the fire, the young Jewish men refused to abandon their trust in the Lord.\nTheir story gives us a powerful picture of what unwavering faith in God looks like in our own lives. We trust that He is with us, no matter what flames we face. We trust in Him when we are sick, encounter financial hardship, and even lose our loved ones. He promises to be with us through it all (Isaiah 43:2). And so even when the king made good on his fiery threat, God proved that He had not abandoned His faithful ones (Daniel 3:25).\nThe Lord can also use our faithfulness to change people’s thoughts and actions in ways we cannot even begin to imagine. Nebuchadnezzar marveled at the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego after witnessing their delivery from the fire, acknowledging, “There is no other god who is able to deliver like this” (Daniel 3:29). Even further, he passed a law that forbade anyone else from speaking against God. This allowed other Jewish exiles to worship God without fear of punishment. This all came about because three young men refused to give up their faith.\nAnd what about us? How do we respond when it seems as if everything and everyone is against us? We lean in closer to the one who refuses to abandon us. We trust that as we walk through the flames, He is with us every step of the way.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Nebuchadnezzar’s Proclamation",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitie Stoddard\n\nAt the core of our faith, we Christians believe that the Triune God is the one, true ruler of the universe. At least that is what we confess with our mouths. But if we’re honest, it’s not always how we order our lives, is it? If you don’t struggle with remembering that only God is God, consider yourself blessed with humility. But if you’re anything like me, it’s easy to slip into acting like you’re in control of your successes and failures—taking credit when things go well, spinning your wheels when things unravel.\nIt’s the original sin in the garden of Eden (Genesis 3), and the one that still haunts us today. When Eve grabbed the fruit, she grabbed at God’s throne. Despite the fact that she was living in paradise with her perfect mate, she wanted more. And we do the same: all too often, we grab at God’s power and we claim God’s glory.\nNot in an obvious way, though. Not like King Nebuchadnezzar who literally claimed he built Babylon by his “vast power” for his “majestic glory” (Daniel 4:30). Cue the eye roll. That guy was so full of himself, it’s hard to feel bad for him when he ends up eating grass (v.25).\nWhile we probably wouldn’t say anything that arrogant out loud, we harbor the same sin of pride in our hearts. Maybe that’s why things like the story of Nebuchadnezzar and the proverb’s warning that “pride comes before destruction, and an arrogant spirit before the fall” (Proverbs 16:18) always seem to spook me a little; because I know I’m a sinner, and I don’t want to wind up eating grass too.\nThank goodness, God is gracious. In His plan for Nebuchadnezzar, we see God intended to show the king mercy. God left the root intact when He chopped Nebuchadnezzar down like a tree. Daniel interpreted that to mean that God would restore Nebuchadnezzar as soon as he turned from his sin and proclaimed God’s rule (Daniel 4:26). This story is a reminder that God is more compassionate than we can imagine. Because we are covered by the blood of Jesus, “He has not dealt with us as our sins deserve” (Psalm 103:10).\nIn remembering God’s graciousness to me, I can’t help but remember what a better Lord He is over my life than I could ever be. We can serve our sinful selves or we can serve the most loving God. When we think about it that way, it’s an easy choice. God’s ways are so much better than our own (Isaiah 55:8–9). We can learn the hard way and find ourselves face down in the grass, or we can choose each day to proclaim the truth that “his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation” (Daniel 4:34). Therefore, “let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord” (1Corinthians 1:31).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Handwriting on the Wall",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Bailey T. Hurley\n\nThe writing was on the wall: No matter how many clothes I purchased or how many beauty treatments I tried, I wasn’t going to get the fulfillment I longed for by my outward appearance.\nI’m embarrassed to admit that I often want women to see me and covet my style, my hair, my home decor. As a woman who loves Jesus, I often put my self-identity in my image and how “put together” people perceive me to be. It’s not just the clothes though; it’s the ability to juggle everything, balancing kid schedules and my own free time. It’s the way I can host a big party and make it look effortless. I even want the God-given opportunities of ministry to look like I do it all on my own. Never mind the privilege and good gifts God provides. I am quick to forget whose glory I am actually seeking: God’s.\nKing Belshazzar, like myself, also struggled with humility. After he was given the privilege and honor of his new role as king, he chose to exalt himself “against the Lord of the heavens” (Daniel 5:23).\nBefore Belshazzar, King Nebuchadnezzar lost his throne when he became arrogant and forgot God’s favor upon him. One would think Belshazzar would have learned from his predecessor’s mistake, but it is not until Daniel interprets the message God had sent that Belshazzar realizes his misplaced glory. Daniel tells Belshazzar, “You have not glorified the God who holds your life-breath in his hand and who controls the whole course of your life” (v.23). Unfortunately, it is too late for him; Belshazzar is killed and his kingdom is handed over to the Medes and Persians (v.28).\nI can’t judge King Belshazzar for wanting the glory for himself, for forgetting who gave him the position of authority in the first place. It’s so easy to forget who controls the whole course of our lives when we are so focused on what we want, when we want it. It can be hard to see the big picture when the things of this world seem so attractive and promise us instant glory. But it is not the things of this world that deserve our attention and worship because they are all “passing away” (1John 2:17).\nIt is God’s glory—whose dominion and power are greater than the greatest kingdom and whose influence reaches far beyond the reign of any king—that deserves our greatest attention. We will all fail like King Belshazzar by exalting ourselves over God and forgetting to acknowledge His power and rule over our lives. But we are also covered by the grace of Christ, which moves us toward a posture of humility. Each day we get to repent and choose to acknowledge God and give Him the worship He deserves.\nForget the latest fashion; I can clothe myself in humility and trust God to “exalt [me] at the proper time… because he cares about [me]” (1Peter 5:6–7). This is a glory that outweighs the attention of others, one that never fades. It is everlasting life in the kingdom of God with a perfect, loving, and kind King.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Daniel in the Lions’ Den",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Abby Flynn\n\nHave you ever been in a lions’ den?\nFor most of us, the answer is probably NO, but metaphorically, that might be a different story. What I’m really asking is this: Have you ever been in a situation where you felt trapped, without options or a way out? Have you ever felt betrayed by the people you trusted? Have you ever wondered if God is big enough to pull you out of that difficult thing you’re facing?\nIn Daniel 6, the entire nation of Judah was in captivity. These people probably often felt defeated, yet they clung to the hope and the promise of a coming Messiah to save them. \nIn the midst of this, Daniel, a Judean, is working for King Darius and gains favor with him. The king positions Daniel for advancement, but this leads to jealousy from the king’s other administrators (Daniel 6:1–5). They knew Daniel served the God of Israel, which was in direct opposition to what the king had commanded. So they convinced the king to put an ordinance in place that anyone who chose to worship another god would be thrown into the lions’ den (vv.6–9). But instead of worshipping in secret or putting his faith on the back burner, Daniel continued praying to God publicly, despite the decree. \n\nThree times a day he got down on his knees,  prayed, and gave thanks to his God, just as he had done before (Daniel 6:10).\n\nThis clash between faith and politics resulted in Daniel being thrown into the lions’ den, even though the king desperately tried to save him. Once inside the den, the king tells Daniel to call out to his God for help. You see, even Darius recognized that Daniel’s God was living and active, something he saw by observing Daniel’s faith. The next morning, the king comes to check on Daniel, only to find he’s miraculously unharmed! (vv.21–22).\nHere’s what this story shows us: No matter how dire things may look, there is NO situation created by man that God cannot change (v.17). There’s no principality, no power, no earthly ruler, or law greater than the one true God. The whole book of Daniel gives us constant reminders of God’s sovereignty. To this day, God is still a rescuer, deliverer, and miracle worker, even when circumstances are difficult.\nSo what are you having a hard time trusting God for? What is the seemingly impossible situation that you’re sitting in with no clear way out? The pressure may be on. You may not see a light at the end of the tunnel. But you can trust that the living God is in the den with you. And He has the ability to “shut the lions’ mouths” (v.22), whatever that may be in your life. \nLord, today we ask that you would remind us of the promises in your Word. Help us to focus our attention on You, instead of fearing the circumstances around us. Tune our hearts to the things you want to show us, even in the lions’ den. Even now.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Ancient of Days and the Son of Man",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Elaine Phillips\n\nThe first part of Daniel’s dream vision was the stuff of night terrors. The four apocalyptic beasts were fierce predators, each more terrifying than the previous one. The four parts of the statue in chapter two represented four kingdoms; now Daniel saw their true nature. These rapacious creatures embodied the four brutal super-powers under which God’s people would suffer—repeatedly. While the stationary image signified the idolatrous world views of the dark kingdoms, the violence of these beasts exposed the lawless end product of idolatry, no matter what form it takes. God’s people should rightfully quail at the prospect. \nFor that reason, the second part of the vision is of utmost importance—for Daniel’s audience and for us.\nThe Almighty God is on His throne. What words can possibly capture God’s radiant and holy presence? God is surrounded by fire and flaming wheels, with an accompanying river of fire. Fire purifies. Woe to us indeed, if we fail to bow our faces to the ground in appropriate fear and dread; “our God is a consuming fire” (Hebrews 12:28–29). \nWhat can convey God’s absolute and everlasting rule of the universe? That’s the point of “Ancient of Days” and blindingly white hair and clothing (see Psalm 104:2). We must linger on these words and images that catapult us to the vaults of heaven. Far above all else that we may find tumultuous and terrifying, God reigns supreme, and God will judge. Daniel saw the books opened and those utterly fearsome beasts either subdued or destroyed.\nThen, the Son of Man arrived with the clouds of heaven, was ushered into the presence of the Ancient of Days, and was given dominion, glory, and power (Daniel 7:13–14). Everyone would serve Him, and His kingdom would never end. In other words, the Son of Man is God. \nJesus intentionally chose this title for Himself (Matthew 8:20; 11:18–19). His audiences might first have thought of Ezekiel, whom God repeatedly summoned with the words, “son of man,” affirming the prophet’s human nature, entirely given over to serving God. But they would also be familiar with this passage. Daniel’s “Son of Man” was invested with all the accoutrements of deity. By consistently calling Himself “Son of Man,” Jesus was affirming and declaring that He is both fully God and fully human. \nThat culminated in the exchange between Caiaphas and Jesus (Matthew 26:57–67). When Caiaphas put Jesus under oath, Jesus declared they would “see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven” (v.64). This one bold statement drew together this passage from Daniel 7 and King David’s words from Psalm 110:1—two key passages Caiaphas would have been well acquainted with, both of which unquestionably point to God and no one less. No wonder those religious leaders at Jesus’s trial tore their robes! \nMake no mistake, Jesus was declaring Himself God before those religious leaders who should have been anxiously awaiting His arrival. Their human judgment of Jesus is an ironic contrast with the image of God’s coming judgment in Daniel 7:9–10. Nevertheless, in God’s cosmic judicial proceedings, those events affected true justice—for eternity.\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Patti Sauls\n\nDeadly beasts, a boasting horn, a heavenly courtroom… what is happening? Are you bewildered by the strange details like me? If so, we’re in good company. Even Daniel was overwhelmed by his own vision. Daniel, the faithful Israelite. Daniel, the brave exile in Babylon. Daniel, the interpreter of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream. But even he couldn’t interpret this one. (Glad I’m not the only one confused.) Feeling terrified and exhausted, he asks an angel within the scene for an explanation. \nWoven into this account of Daniel’s vision is God’s reminder that it’s okay not to have all the answers. He gives us freedom to wonder and be uncertain. God invites us to prayerfully ask for help (Philippians 4:6–7) and to search for clarity (Psalm 119:12–16). However, the humbling reality is that we just won’t understand it all. For example, most scholars interpret the four beasts in Daniel’s vision as the empires of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, yet there is debate about which kings the horns represent, how the little horn specifically attempts to dominate, the timing of it all, and so on.\nThere’s a lot we don’t know, but there’s a lot we do know, too. We see these mighty empires puffed up with pride and self-sufficiency. They devour, crush, and trample as they oppress and conquer their neighbors (Daniel 7:19). What a picture of how humans behave like beasts when we reject our Creator! Individuals and societies disintegrate when we refuse to believe that every human is made in the image of God and deserves dignity. Seeking “my will be done” instead of “God, your will be done” diminishes our humanity. The ruthless kingdoms rise, then, inevitably crumble.\nThe angelic interpreter also tells Daniel that the ten horns represent kings who will rule after the fall of the brutal fourth kingdom. Daniel is especially horrified by another little horn that rose up to overtake the others. It represents a tyrannical leader who arrogantly rejects God, wages war against God’s people, and positions himself as a tyrant over all creation.\nYet, all is not lost. Horror gives way to hope as Daniel watches the ultimate reckoning unfold. A heavenly court convenes and God Himself, called the “Ancient of Days,” takes the judgment seat. The Judge rules; the verdict is in. All who have set themselves up against the authority of God are sentenced to eternal death. Then, one who looks like the son of man joins the Judge to accept the rule and reign of God’s kingdom of eternal life.\nWhile Daniel strained to see and understand this hope, we can look to Jesus, who called Himself “the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven” (Mark 14:62). Even though we don’t have all the answers, we can rest assured “that the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever, yes, forever and ever” (Daniel 7:18). World without end, from horror to hope… Amen!\n\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Vision of a Ram and a Goat",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nI’m always looking for a way to get out of work. Lately, a global pandemic has proven an excellent excuse for me to close up shop by noon to put my feet up while I indulge in existential worry and consider rearranging my indoor plants. Maybe you like to give up a little on your kingdom work, too, when the future looks bleak. But let’s consider that our callings remain vitally important in spite of whatever germs, climates, powers, or terrifying bugs may be buzzing around us.\nBiblical prophecy usually has at least two applications: one specific interpretation and one related, general, big-picture meaning. Sometimes the specific meaning of the prophecy is revealed soon after the prophecy, and sometimes thousands of years elapse before the meaning is clear. Looking back, some of these prophecies look really obvious, like: “Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign: See, the virgin will conceive, have a son, and name him Immanuel” (Isaiah 7:14). But at the time of Isaiah’s prophecy, an immaculate conception didn’t make any earthly sense. The prophet often doesn’t get to enjoy an understanding of the prophecy. Here, Daniel is given a very specific vision and an interpretation. But he still could not understand it. \nDaniel sees a vision of judgment for sin. He sees an angry ram and a violent goat and absurdly large horns. He sees the result of sin running rampant in a civilization. And he asks, just as we might ask, “How long?” (Daniel 8:13). How long will this last? And the “holy one” answers with a finite number. In this case it is 2,300 days (v.14), but notice the number is a real, countable number. The big picture is that sin is sometimes allowed to flourish—but not forever.\nThe whole ordeal appalls and overwhelms Daniel. Understandably. But here’s the part we should really notice in particular: He “got up and went about the king’s business” (Daniel 8:27). The scary news didn’t make Daniel give up. The confusing and difficult revelations did not prevent him from holding on to what he did know, what he did understand. He took a minute, and then he went back to work. He got on his feet and did the good work the Lord had called him to. He engaged in the culture and continued doing his faithful work.\nEven when we feel afraid, even when we look to the future and dread wells up in our hearts, we know the most essential truth: God is on the throne. This is His creation and we, the Church, are His Bride. The angel tells Daniel, “Son of man… understand that the vision refers to the time of the end” (Daniel 8:17). The “end” will come. The suffering in the world is limited and finite. But we never need to fear the end. Remember how Christ spoke to His disciples of the end times, saying, “Be courageous! I have conquered the world” (John 16:33).\nThough we may, like Daniel, be “overcome and lay sick for days” (v.27) when we look at the state of the world, and wonder how it can all possibly come to good, we are called to remember that God is busy at work. Therefore, we can rise like Daniel, and go about the business that God has set before us. We can be of good courage, knowing that the end of the story is not the triumph of wickedness, but the victory of Christ. Truly, we are more than conquerors in Christ who rules and reigns forever. So take heart, and go about your kingdom work.\n\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Daniel’s Prayer",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nIn Shakespeare’s history play, Richard II, John of Gaunt mourns England’s degradation on his deathbed, intoning, “That England, that was wont to conquer others, Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.” The greatness of England was fading away because of its internal corruption. And this is the truth of all civilizations. They do not fall because of external attack, but they collapse from the corruption and rot festering on the inside.\nRepeatedly in Scripture, we also see the children of Israel making a shameful conquest of themselves. There will always be some battle raging, but it’s not a fight against governments and revolutions; the battle is spiritual. The battle is for and in our own hearts. In the New Testament, the apostle Paul arms himself with powerful weapons, urging us to: “Pray at all times in the Spirit, with every prayer and request, and stay alert with all perseverance and intercession for all the saints” (Ephesians 6:18).\nCenturies before Paul, Daniel relies on the same principle. The fulfillment of God’s promise to restore the conquered city of Jerusalem and its exiled people was at hand, and Daniel recognized that this providential showering of grace was an opportunity to fix all his hope on God. Israel had fallen to conquest precisely because it had walked in pride and unrepentance. It had rotted from the inside. \nDaniel’s prayer is not about self-reliance, or newfound worthiness to return to their homeland. He recognizes that righteousness belongs to God alone (Daniel 9:7). His grace alone, His provision alone is sufficient. He alone can root out the inward-rottenness and make us a new creation, a new nation, and a royal priesthood for Himself.\nDaniel prayed: “We are not presenting our petitions before you based on our righteous acts, but based on your abundant compassion. Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, listen and act! My God, for your own sake, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your name” (Daniel 9:18–19).\nLike Daniel, our focus must be on our continual need of God’s provision. He must lay conquest to our hearts, that we may not be given over to self-destruction. He alone is righteous and able to save (Daniel 9:7). And, like Daniel, we have this great comfort: He does save. He hears the cries of His people, and restores the inheritance of His saints. He does not leave us as orphans and exiles (John 14:18), but in His own righteousness, He mightily saves.\nThe restoration of Jerusalem was a foreshadowing of the restoration of Christ, who has made a glorious conquest of the human heart. He has conquered our hearts, and become our confidence, hope, joy, and strength are founded upon the unchanging and transforming righteousness of God.\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Elaine Phillips\n\nReality: “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this darkness, against evil, spiritual forces in the heavens” (Ephesians 6:12). \nReally? \nHow easily we find ourselves thinking that Twitter feeds, mindless sound bites, even whole paragraphs about presidents, protestors, politics, and pandemics are the substance of our realities. Turns out the apostle Paul did not think of reality so superficially. Neither did Daniel. \nLooking back 2500 years ago, international politics were dicey then too. The super power had shifted from Babylon to Persia practically overnight. There seem to have been crises at the top; the alternating names Darius the Mede and Cyrus leave a whiff of uncertainty, not just for puzzled commentators but possibly for real people at that time. \nDaniel was a venerable statesman—probably in his eighties at this point—when he chose to fast, humble himself, and seek greater understanding of the rapidly changing circumstances surrounding him (Daniel 10:2–3,12). He commenced these disciplines just prior to the festival of Passover, three years into the Persian rule. Perhaps he anticipated an immediate response in time to celebrate the Passover traditions of redemption from bondage. His previous prayer experience might have led him to expect it. Directly after the Persian takeover, he had prayed earnestly, and the angel Gabriel arrived in swift flight with an answer, even while Daniel was still praying (chapter 9). \nThis time was different. Three long weeks passed before the response came. In the meantime, Daniel likely did not eat the Passover meal or drink the cups of wine. When the vision did come, it was overwhelming. Daniel fell to his face before the linen-clad figure, who was wearing a sash of gold, had flaming eyes, a face like lightning, and a thunderous voice (note Revelation 1:13–15). \nThe messenger spoke of warring dark powers in the heavens, reaching their tentacles into every earthly turmoil. Evil and sinister “princes” underlay the destructive kingdoms of the Persians and Greeks, both of whom would oppress God’s people severely. The future trauma detailed in chapter 11 would occur more than two centuries after Daniel’s lifetime. Nevertheless, Daniel’s revelation here made it clear these tumultuous events were not outside God’s sovereign plan (Daniel 4:34).\nBack to our present: the brutal evil we see daily is an imprint of cosmic war; it requires vigilance and powerful prayer intervention. Hence, Paul’s admonition to put on the full armor of God and to stand, stand, stand firm. Daniel, a ”treasured” person, heard the same admonition: stand and be strong (Daniel 10:11,19). \nHow do we stand strong when lies incessantly rage and evil powers rear their ugly heads? “Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10) takes on another dimension, doesn’t it? We must stand against everything false and contrary to the knowledge of God, taking every thought captive to Christ (2Corinthians 10:3–5), ordering our lives by God’s truth, and praying faithfully that the burning arrows of the evil one will be extinguished.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nMy daughters were in Narnia for the first time this summer. Every night, they’d beg for the next chapter of C.S. Lewis’s beloved fantasy series. The spell has taken them in, totally, as we talk of Aslan and Lucy, of Reepicheep and Mr. Tumnus, of glory and dust, of past and future. Prince Caspian is the second book in the series, and its opening chapters read like a stop-and-start, future-and-past prophecy. The Pevensie children return to Narnia, and find themselves retracing their Narnian steps 1300 years after they left, though it has only been a year at home in England. Caspian, the titular character, knew the legends but never expected to find Peter and Susan and Edmund and Lucy and Aslan to come to his aid, restoring his place as rightful king.\nAs they struggle to grasp the reality of waking up in the ancient ruins of their once-glorious Cair Paravel, time shifts forward and backward in their minds. Could this be my sword? Peter wonders. Our table? Our home? Is this where we danced and played and ruled a beautiful, peaceful kingdom?\nHolding the tension of “the already and not yet,” the mix of grief with memory but also hope, is a benchmark of the Christian life, and I felt that familiar, yet somehow distant, feeling while reading Daniel’s third prophecy, in Daniel 11. Already living in exile, Daniel is given a prophecy of an even longer exile, while also clinging to the hope of the Davidic kingdom the Israelites had once known, longing for the time when they would finally leave exile and rebuild Jerusalem.\nDaniel’s prophecies were very real to his audience and to the Jewish people. They predicted events that would be fulfilled over the next four hundred years of Israel’s history—redemption that would come for a season and a people. But the redemption Daniel foresaw comes to us as well. We cling to the hope of something that was here once (Eden), and we know will one day come again (God’s fully restored kingdom). \nDaniel’s prophecies, especially here, are for us, too, as people of God’s already-and-not-yet kingdom. As believers with a future hope, we constantly experience the push and pull of kingdom living. Our hearts quicken to signs and wonders, reminding us of something that hasn’t happened yet, but we somehow miss and long for anyway. We are Prince Caspian, steeped in the ancient history of our beloved kingdom, but never expecting the good king himself to break into our present. \nBut when he does, it’s glorious. And that hope that Daniel prophesies and the rest of Scripture proclaims, is very real. God’s kingdom is everlasting, from generation to generation. Once, hundreds of years after Daniel’s exile, Jesus broke into the earthly realm and planted the seeds of God’s kingdom. And one day, He will come again, and bring with Him the full flourishing kingdom that our hearts were made to hope for.\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Patti Sauls\n\nScripture Reading: Daniel 12:1-13, 2 Peter 3:8-13, Revelation 1:4-8\n“How long, LORD? Will you forget me forever?” (Psalm 13:1). When I’m struggling, these words from the psalmist often echo in my mind. I was 15 years old when I learned about Jesus, began reading the Bible, and became a Christian. Now I look back on over thirty years of following God and finding Him faithful. Yet when I trudge through deep valleys of anxiety, conflict, or brokenness, I still often find myself doubting, wondering, Lord, do you see me? Do you care?\nDaniel’s visions were terrifying, and the suffering he saw was ongoing and global. He was given a weighty responsibility to witness and report such intense distress. Yet he was also given a powerful reminder of God’s promises. This gracious reminder is for us as well.\nAn angelic interpreter explained to Daniel, “Those who have insight will shine like the bright expanse of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever” (Daniel 12:3). What a strange thing to say, that God’s people would shine like stars. But the imagery was not lost on Daniel. He was a faithful Israelite, and this “star talk” would trigger the memory of God’s ancient promise made in the midst of another man’s vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield… Look at the sky and count the stars, if you are able to count them…. Your offspring will be that numerous” (Genesis 15:1,5).  God promised to grow and protect a vast nation through Abram’s family tree. Yet, as the years went by and his wife, Sarai, bore no children, Abram began to fear that God might not be true to His Word.\nLike Abram, Daniel was scared of the future. When would the distress give way to deliverance? “How long until the end of these wondrous things?” asked another witness in the vision (Daniel 12:6). Daniel didn’t get all the answers, but he did receive assurance that God was, and would always be, trustworthy. In remembering the stars, Daniel knew that God had not forgotten Abram. A son, Isaac, was born. God kept His promise to grow the nation of Israel through Abram’s descendants, and He changed Abram’s name to Abraham, meaning “Father of a Multitude” (Genesis 17:5). God proved Himself true to Abraham, and He would continue to be faithful to Daniel and all future believers.\nMaybe the stars can trigger our memory of God’s faithfulness too. God knows we can be confused by the world’s suffering and by our own pain. Like Daniel, we may be scared of the future. But God assures us He is “the Alpha and the Omega… the one who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty” (Revelation 1:8).\nThis is our trustworthy, unchanging, eternal hope. God established His people through Abraham’s son, and He protects and secures His people through His own Son, Jesus. God is with us: we are His people, and He is our God. We may forget God, but He does not forget us. He sees us, and He cares for us. Remember the stars.\n\nPatti Sauls lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband Scott and daughters, Abby and Ellie, where they serve alongside the people of Christ Presbyterian Church.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Patti Sauls\n\nOne tomato. I had grand plans for our backyard garden, but all I got to show for hours of watering and weeding was one, tiny, red tomato. I wish I could wax eloquent about the satisfaction of eating the fruit of my labors. (Fun fact: Tomatoes are botanically classified as fruit.) Instead, my lone tomato humbled me as I admitted that my efforts weren’t enough to produce abundant fruit. \nToday’s reading reveals garden rhythms as well. On the night before He was arrested, Jesus said to His disciples, “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener” (John 15:1). Jesus comforted His friends by reminding them that God vigilantly tends to all of His creation. \nJesus’s encouragement continued as He described branches, which grew from the vine and produced fruit. These branches, representing His followers, would be healthy and fruitful as long as they were connected to the vine. “Remain in me, and I in you. Just as a branch is unable to produce fruit by itself unless it remains on the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me” (John 15:4).\nThe apostle Paul further described this spiritual fruit, explaining that “the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control” (Galatians 5:22–23). These qualities shine collectively like the facets of a sparkling diamond. Together, they illuminate a Christian’s growing inner posture of dependence and obedience toward God, as well as her outer impact on the people and world around her. To this nourishing fruit I say, “Yes, please!”\nBut how do we produce such fruit? Do I summon my will power and attempt to weed out my sinful nature that so quickly yields hate, jealousy, selfishness, and worse? (Galatians 5:19–21). I may try, but as soon as I pull up one ugly weed, others sprout up in its place. This scramble ends with the same result as my backyard garden—little fruit and lots of awareness of my inability to produce it.\nAre we sentenced to fruitless despair? No, we are given a resource that Jesus announces and seals with a promise: “I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Counselor to be with you forever” (John 14:16). What deep relief! God doesn’t intend for us to muster up spiritual growth on our own. Instead, the Holy Spirit is poured out on us to work in us. \nAlthough we are dependent on the Spirit to produce fruit, we are not passive. As a sunflower turns its head to seek out the sun, so we can orient our lives toward God through prayer, Bible study, repentance, praise, and other habits. As Paul said, “If we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:25). We are free to put one foot in front of the other, confidently seeking faithful obedience while resting and remaining in the promise that God fuels our movement by His Spirit at work in and through us.\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Jen Yokel\n\nOf all the aspects of the fruit of the Spirit, love feels like the most universal and, somehow, the most elusive. If you’ve ever tried to explain what it’s like, you know what I mean. Love can feel like analyzing every word of every conversation between meeting someone and confessing your feelings. It can feel like the comfortable silence of deep friendship. It can feel like filling your Instagram feed with pictures of a new baby, or late-night scrolling through photographic memories of a faraway friend. We write songs about it, cry while watching movies that try to portray it, maybe even try to deny it, declaring it a lie when our hearts are broken. \nBut Scripture tells us that the true definition of love is found in who God is. In fact, it’s one of the surest things we can know about God, a virtue greater than even faith and hope (1Corinthians 13:13). Scripture tells us “God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him” (1John 4:16). \nThe famous “love chapter” of 1 Corinthians 13 outlines many attributes of this love: patience, kindness, not insisting on its own way, rejoicing in truth, hoping and enduring everything. Enduring wars and disease and hatred. Outlasting empires and buildings and movements. In this litany of love’s attributes, I see the face of God. I hear God’s invitation to make ourselves at home in this love and let it transform us through the indwelling Holy Spirit.\nThis sort of love is nonsensical, if you think about it. It isn’t a vague, obligatory love for people who are like you, and it goes beyond the bonds of family, friends, or spouse. This love extends the circle wider and wider, transcending rational thought about who is worthy of love; it persists no matter what and in any circumstance, without condition.\nThe apostle Paul said, “The whole law is fulfilled in one statement: Love your neighbor as yourself” (Galatians 5:14). What could that look like today, as we imitate Christ to seek the welfare of our neighbors? When we make ourselves at home in God’s transformative love, we are changed. We are empowered to join God in repairing the world, to press on and show our neighbors what we value and to whom we belong.\n“You were called to be free, brothers and sisters; only don’t use this freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but serve one another through love” (Galatians 5:13). May it be so in us, the Holy Spirit growing love in our hearts for the flourishing of our families, our neighbors, and all of creation.\n\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Joy",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Bailey T. Hurley\n\nBackstage, before any school music theater performance, our teacher would remind us: “Put on your Disney face!” The “Disney face” was a term meant to encourage happy, bright faces. We were to hold an extra twinkle in our eye, plaster on the largest smile, and over exaggerate each movement while we were on stage, to look as happy and as animated as a Disney character. But it was a façade. It was acting. Our smiles cracked around the edges, and the stage makeup smeared under the hot, heavy lights. The portrayed happiness was left onstage, a fleeting moment and not a reflection of the pain and problems of life off stage. Because in a high school musical, the story tends to end with a “happily ever after.” \nWhen I think of a Christian’s joy, I often think the world sees it as a fake, plastered-on type of joy. They believe we either ignore the real pain around us, choosing to remain ignorant of it, or we “fake it ‘til we make it.” After all, how could we possibly have genuine joy when everyone knows life is difficult and hard?\nBut “Disney face” happiness is not the true joy the Bible talks about. Biblical joy is not dependent on circumstances, nor is it something we have to force ourselves to feel. Our source of joy doesn’t come from ourselves; it is sourced by God who fills us “with all joy and peace” as we trust in Him and allow the Holy Spirit to help us through the trials and pain of life (Romans 15:13). \nTo see me in real life, it might be easy to assume I’m a joyful person, and many would find it difficult to grasp that I struggle with depression and anxiety. These symptoms pop up out of nowhere, and they can make me feel out of control, unable to pull myself out of the grief and fear that I experience. Yet, despite my personal dark seasons, there is an underlying presence of joy that continues. It is the Holy Spirit who holds the grief and the joy together and allows both to exist at the same time.\nEven though I may feel afflicted, I am not crushed. When I feel struck down by circumstances, I am not destroyed (2Corinthians 4:8–9). The power of Jesus to overcome sin, darkness, and pain gives me a source for joy. I can delight in a God who is not only sovereign over my life, but is also loving and slow to anger, compassionate and gracious (Exodus 34:6). And when things are tough, beyond my own ability to find a glimmer of joy, I am met in the midst of my pain. In His presence there is “abundant joy” (Psalm 16:11). \nSo, despite how others may perceive our joy, we have confidence that joy is rooted in something more than a smile on our face. It is a gift from the Holy Spirit, an everlasting hope. And as we walk with the Spirit, we are filled “with inexpressible and glorious joy” (1Peter 1:8). \n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nWhen I think about peace, I imagine three different things. First, I think of the wrap-around porch at my favorite bed and breakfast on Pawleys Island, South Carolina, where we like to vacation in the summer. It looks out over a marsh, where pelicans dive for fish and the sun paints the grasses yellow and then green. Second, I think of my friend Andi, a woman who imparts wisdom with every word she speaks, whose calm tone pervades every syllable. And finally, I think of the moment when my body sinks into a hot bath. The knowledge that I can sit undisturbed for 20 or 30 minutes is as soothing as the steam.\nBut our good God tells us that peace is not about a vacation. It’s not about trying to imitate a soft tone of voice, which while authentic to my friend Andi, would be disingenuous if I put it on for size. And it is not about finding more time for self-care, which brings only temporary relief. He knows that the world outside—and the world inside my own mind—is full of strife. But when Christ came, He promised to give His disciples PEACE, not as a means of escape, but as a means to exist and thrive without fear in the midst of the chaos of our world.\nAccording to the scriptures, peace is one aspect of the fruit of the Holy Spirit, something that God the Great Gardener will grow in our hearts and lives if we entrust ourselves to His care, no matter our circumstances. Peace will look different in different people’s lives. In the same way that hydrangeas bloom in different colors in different places, depending on the pH of the soil, peace will arrive in our hearts, blooming in its own way, in its own time. One thing is certain: if God promises to give it, then we will certainly receive it. \nIn John 14, Jesus says that peace is something He gives away, freely and without cost—not as the world might try to offer it (John 14:27). In Romans, the apostle Paul encourages believers to remember that “we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). And in his letter to the Philippians, he says “the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding” is able to guard our hearts and minds (Philippians 4:6–7). \nIn the end, our confidence comes not in our own ability to create peace, but in our relationship with the God of the universe who loves us and provides peace in abundance, simply as an act of His great love. Christ is a means of reconciling all people together in unity, no matter the earthly divisions that try to breed hostility between us (Ephesians 2:11–22). God’s peace is not theoretical. It is real. My circumstances might be in total disarray. Vacations and plans might be canceled. Factions might rise up against each other with weapons or words. In the midst of it all, our eternity is settled, our hearts can rest at ease, knowing that God is our peace.\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nMy youngest daughter turns three next month. She is at the delightfully frustrating age where she wants to do far more than she is physically or emotionally able to do, and usually, that means I spend a lot of time waiting for her to “do it all by my OWN!” (Her adorable way of saying “myself.”) \nWe love to go on walks as a family in the evenings. My eldest flies down the sidewalk on her bike with training wheels, but my youngest isn’t very speedy. Nor does she try particularly hard to go fast on her scooter or her balance bike. More often that not, my husband and I trade off for the very arduous, slow task of pushing her, drenched with summer sweat, watching the other spouse laughing and jogging in the distance. No manner of coaxing, teaching, encouraging, or letting her go on hills will motivate her to do it herself. So a few weeks ago, I bought her a tricycle. I thought, Surely this will solve our nightly struggle! But dear reader, it did not. Now we just take turns pushing her princess-adorned tricycle up and down the hill.\nThere is no fast track for learning to ride a bike, but boy, has it ever tested my patience almost every night this past summer, along with nearly everything else about this almost-comically-catastrophic year. My patience ran out on day two of quarantine, and that was over eight months ago. Have we ever, collectively, felt so impatient, so restless, so tired of non-progress? I’m impatient for the past and the future at the same time. I reason, If we can’t go back to where we were, maybe we could at least hurry up and get to where we’re going! \nThis, my friends, is the same tension we feel spiritually. Our impatience for all things to be made new through the restoring, perfecting power of Jesus lingers every day. We long for it to be here soon—Maranatha! Come, Lord! The prophet describes this very longing, set in the hearts of all who believe (Isaiah 30:18–26). And yet, there is a difference between patience from the Spirit (waiting for God’s kingdom to reign forever!) and sinful impatience. \nSinful impatience says, “I know what’s right and exactly what I need, and I’m mad I’m not getting it right now.” Patience says, “I trust the Lord and His promises.” Scripture leads us to the same conclusion: a proud spirit is bound up in impatience (Ecclesiastes 7:8). Patience is grown from trust in the Lord and His timing, convinced He knows what we really need, in every realm and facet of our lives. \nI believe my daughter will learn to ride a bike. I believe Jesus will return. There are a lot of things I believe I need or want to be happy, but ultimately, my attitude is more often than not one of prideful impatience. It’s impatience born out of my desire to be in control. What the Holy Spirit provides through ongoing sanctification is true patience. I trust Him with my eternity; I need to better trust Him with each day. \n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Abby Flynn\n\nI grew up in the Midwest, but headed South after college in search of career opportunities and warmer weather. I eventually wound up in the Bible Belt, where I was swiftly initiated into the world of Southern charm. At first, I was shocked by how kind everyone was! But as the weeks and months in my new city went on, I realized not all of the “Bless your hearts,” were actual blessings. And most of the passing “We should get together sometime” farewells weren’t really future social invitations. It seemed that some Southern charm was actually just a cover-up for awkward situations. It was a way to seem like a nice person without ever actually having to do anything nice. Now granted, I still live in the South and have grown to love it. But I have to be watchful, even in my own life, of not mistaking being “nice” for genuine kindness.\nIn contrast, today’s reading reminds us of what real, Holy Spirit kindness looks like. And it’s about a whole lot more than just donating to charities and holding the door open for the person behind you. When we fully understand and begin to emulate real, Christ-like kindness, it will affect every aspect of our lives.\nTitus 3 shows us that God’s love and kindness are not just genuine—they have a purpose: to lead us back to Him! (Titus 3:4–7). So when kindness is evident in our treatment of others, we, in turn, are pointing them toward God. Because “when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit” (vv.4–5).\nAs followers of Jesus, we’re called to show graciousness and mercy to everyone, even our enemies. Yes, that even means the people we disagree with on Facebook, and the ones who have nothing to offer us in return (Luke 6:34–35). You see, kindness is at the heart of the gospel. We are all sinners and imperfect people who have been radically forgiven. There is nothing we could do to earn the love and mercy of the Lord, and yet He gives it to us freely. That’s kindness that we cannot begin to understand.\nSo as Christians, what does the Spirit producing kindness in us look like in everyday life? Maybe it’s the Lord making you a light in the world, offering hope to your coworkers or family. Or perhaps, it’s practicing graciousness in the middle of a difficult situation. Kindness might look like extending mercy to someone who has hurt you, whether they deserve it or not. Our kindness will play a huge part in our testimony, if only we will allow God to use it. But make no mistake, however kindness is exemplified in our lives, it is grown and cultivated by the Holy Spirit, a mark of His own kindness toward us.\nLord, open our eyes to see others as you see them: fellow image-bearers of our Creator. Make us instruments of your kindness and reflections of your mercy, even now.\n\n",

I hadn’t rehearsed a “favorite book of the Bible” speech, but I’d been a Christian-school-Baptist-church kid long enough to have an answer.\n“James,” I said.\n“Why?”\n“Because it’s really clear and it tells me what to do.”\nSomehow I found comfort in the clarity of James because I was still young enough to think I could be perfect, what with the book’s directives to consider suffering to be amazing, or the whole if you can’t control your tongue, your faith is false (James 1). I mean, I knew I’d messed up in the past, but with the start of a new day, I could start over at trying to be perfect, right? Or maybe even starting now—well, maybe not right-this-second now, but NOW, as in starting tomorrow. God would surely accept my goodness if it were fully and perfectly good starting tomorrow, right?\nThe words of James are holy and beautiful and true, but I was misunderstanding them because I was completely fixated on my goodness. I thought James was telling me to strive for joy in suffering and a perfectly controlled tongue and actions that perfectly lined up with every command in the Bible. I didn’t yet understand that having a relationship with Jesus would naturally produce the goodness James spoke about. I didn’t understand that the goodness I was to be pursuing was the goodness of God, fruit of the Holy Spirit, not the “goodness” of Scarlet.\nPsalm 31 declares, “How great is your goodness”—meaning God’s goodness (Psalm 31:19). If we’re aiming to bear fruit and striving to be thought of as good for the sake of our own identity, not only are we doing it wrong, but we will never get it right. God is good. We are broken. Pursuing goodness in our own strength also means pursuing heartbreak, failure, hopelessness, and even idolatry.\nBut if we pursue joy in the Lord, if we look at His goodness and remember the ways He is good to us—His power over death and ability to forgive us, and His promise to love us unfailingly—we can be people marked by His fruit. Not fruit that says, “Come see how good I look in my white eyelet shirt and with my awesome knowledge of the book of James!” But fruit that whispers that I am “radiant with joy because of the LORD’S goodness” (Jeremiah 31:12).\nBeauty, goodness, and joy pour out of us when, and only when, we are enraptured by and grateful for the goodness of the Lord. And in my limited experience, the more time I spend seeing and enjoying Him in the pages of the Bible, the more clearly I see that He is, just as our hearts hope, so very good.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Alena Pitts\n\nGod is faithful. \nAbout two years ago, I would have called God anything but faithful. I had just lost my mom and my world was turned completely upside down. God didn’t seem far. He actually felt nonexistent. “He is faithful. He is faithful. He is faithful,” I would forcefully utter to myself, barely believing it, whispering it, down on my knees. As a 14-year-old dealing with the gravity of not having a mom, the words “He is faithful” did not naturally spill off of my tongue. But I continued to utter those words, praying that they would one day become real to me.\nTrusting His faithfulness is one of the hardest things to believe about the Father. As humans who can’t see the full picture, we assume God has just stopped drawing it. When we can’t clearly see, hear, or feel Him, we assume He is not present. We believe He has left us. \nI, for one, am grateful that this isn’t just a 21st-century feeling. Throughout the Bible, we watch God’s people doubt His faithfulness time and time again. Sarah doubted that God would fulfill His promise of giving her a child (Genesis 18:10–15). The Israelites felt abandoned and lived in disbelief about God bringing them out of Egypt and into a future in the promised land (Exodus 16:1–12; 17:1–7). And throughout the psalms, David continues to ask God why He has left him (see Psalm 22). \nThank God that we see their pictures and stories fully drawn out. Sarah did receive her promised son (Genesis 21:1–7), the Israelites made it into the promised land (Joshua 21:43–45), and God rescued David again and again (see Psalm 30). It turns out He is still working, even when He seems silent. Here’s the best news: God doesn’t remove His promises from us when we doubt. He is compassionate, patient, and understanding (Exodus 34:6–7). What a humbling thought! \nLooking back now at the last two years of my life, I have experienced God’s faithfulness in an entirely new way. I didn’t see it then, but years later I clearly see His hand at work. Deuteronomy 7:9 says, “Know that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps His gracious covenant loyalty for a thousand generations with those who love him and keep his commands.”\nYes, God is faithful. His Word is true. And if we belong to Him, He makes us more like Him (1John 1:5–7). The Holy Spirit displays this faithfulness in and through us, which helps us to be faithful to God and to others (Luke 6:43–45).\nMy prayer for you is that our faithful, promise-keeping God would reveal Himself to you. That you would look back one month, five months, or a few years from now, and clearly see His hand on the canvas of your life. He is faithful, and by His Spirit, we grow in faithfulness.\n\nSixteen-year-old author, vocalist, and actress, Alena Pitts, recently made her professional acting debut in the 2015 film, War Room—the 6th-highest grossing Christian film in box-office history.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Erin Davis\n\nIn an instant, the whole world seemed to fall away. We had just been told that our unborn child had serious and life-threatening medical issues. The doctor delivering the news was clinical…cold…indifferent. To her, this was just another baby who might not make it. To us, it was a category five hurricane of fear, stress, and pain. \nAs the doctor rattled off our options (none of them good), my heart started to race and my palms became sweaty. I was having trouble comprehending the information. I fought simultaneous urges to either bolt from the room and melt into the exam table. Then came the hand…\nThe ultrasound tech sitting beside me reached out his hand and held mine. He didn’t say a word. His gift to me was a soft touch. It was a simple, sweet gesture loaded with power. His gentleness put an oxygen mask on my heart. I could breathe again. I could think again. I could face my new reality. All because a stranger tenderly reached toward me. \nEncounters with true gentleness are rare. As broken people in a broken world, this is not our way, not our natural inclination. As I reflect on how I interact with others most often it’s clear: if life is a china shop, then I am a bull. In my flesh, I barrel my way through conversations, I crash through conflicts, I careen through daily life. Jesus reaches toward us with a different way, though—the way of gentleness. \nThe book of Isaiah records the prophet’s description of God’s power (Isaiah 40:10). But then Isaiah seems to make a hard right:\nHe tends his flock like a shepherd:He gathers the lambs in his armsand carries them close to his heart;he gently leads those that have young (Isaiah 40:11, NIV).\nGod doesn’t have mood swings. He isn’t one or the other—He is both. He is unmatched in both power and gentleness (Matthew 11:29). He commands heaven’s armies (Psalm 46:7) and tenderly leads His flock. He is the roaring lion of Judah and our precious Passover Lamb. All of this points to His power, which is strong enough to destroy sin and death and gentle enough to woo us toward Him with His grace. \nAs God’s children, the Spirit teaches us to live in this remarkable tension. We don’t have to clamor for attention, for influence, for power. Our lives can gently whisper about God’s goodness. And the world who is in the eye of the hurricane of sin and darkness will listen. God’s gentleness, extended through us, is so shocking it warrants attention. Jesus, in His mercy, has reached His gentle hand toward us. May the power of His Spirit help us reach out in gentleness toward others. \nLord, thank you for being our powerfully gentle Savior. Teach us to be more like you. Amen.\n\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Self-Control",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nBefore the kids woke up yesterday, I read 1 Corinthians 9 aloud to my husband over coffee. We don’t always read Scripture out loud to each other in the mornings. Often, mornings are all about the baby, and the puppy, and the breakfast preferences of the children. (Who hates blackberries? Have you eaten anything other than peanut butter this week?) But when I do read Scripture in the morning, I always end up reading it out loud—because it gets me so emphatically stirred up.\nWithin this passage, I took a startled pause at verse 27: “I discipline my body and bring it under strict control, so that after preaching to others, I myself will not be disqualified” (1Corinthians 9:27). I shouted to my husband, “Now, that’s not the gospel I know!” He looked at me in alarm because the children were absolutely still sleeping, and said, “I think Paul is talking about his qualifications as an effective minister.” \nThe gospel that I know is one of grace and faith, not a gospel of works. The “work” is already done by Christ’s sacrifice, death, and resurrection. There is nothing I can do to make God love me one iota more or one tick less. Hallelujah! Full stop. So how dare Paul talk about disqualification? And his reference to the physical training of the body, makes my sweet, soft, motherly self feel even more uncomfortable. I know that the gates of heaven don’t require me to qualify by running a mile in four minutes. But what does Paul mean? Because I’d like to skip over this bit and get back to the part where God is comforting me and telling me not to be afraid.\nBut Augustine of Hippo said, “If you believe what you like in the Gospel, and reject what you don’t like, it is not the Gospel you believe, but yourself.” Okay, right. Noted. Those are dark, deep, waters in which I do not wish to swim.  \nSo what is the role and value of self-control in the life of the believer? It is not the grounds of salvation, but it is the outpouring of a sanctified heart. “Now everyone who competes exercises self-control in everything. They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we have an imperishable crown” (1Corinthians 9:25). The self-control of athletes is laudable. So the Holy Spirit equips us to exercise self-control in our minds and hearts minute to minute as we encounter our days. This self-control is the practical outworking of genuine faith. We run as if to win, because we value the great salvation we already have in Christ—He has already won it for us.\nWe all know exactly where we can show more self-control: show more restraint, be less controlled by emotions, etc. But it’s probably personal and different for each of us. But I do not have the strength and self-control to pull myself together. If my resolve were strong enough to give up sugar and be a perfect parent, I would have already done it. But our self-control, our qualifications, and our strength come from walking in step with the Spirit. As we walk, our hearts will be changed and the courage and strength to exercise control over our weak and fragile minds and bodies will grow. Walk with the Spirit. Run to Christ and He will make you whole.\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Jessica Lamb\n\nGod is not only universally present above and beyond creation; He is also personally present, dwelling with His people.\nSometimes, I’m afraid to acknowledge the nearness of God. I’m afraid of what I’ll hear, or what uncomfortable truths I’ll have to face about who I am, because to encounter God’s presence means to be made more and more like Him (2Corinthians 3:18). So I ignore the reality of His persistent, relational presence, and instead turn to distraction: working more, endlessly scrolling through social media, blasting my favorite podcast, or binge-watching a television show—anything to numb my heart and mind.\nBut to live this way is to miss out on really knowing Him, to miss the opportunity to join the psalmist in proclaiming the gift of God’s presence: “As for me, God’s presence is my good. I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, so I can tell about all you do” (Psalm 73:28).\nOnce I started looking for the theme of God’s presence in Scripture, I began to find it on every page. Sure, I’d thought about God’s presence before. I know He is enthroned on high (Psalm 113:4–6). I know He fills the heavens and the earth and that there is nowhere I can go where He doesn’t see me (Psalm 139; Jeremiah 23:24).\nBut Scripture has so much more to say about God’s presence. In passage after passage, we’re told that God also desires to be relationally present with His people. Authors and biblical scholars J. Scott Duvall and J. Daniel Hays even suggest that this is the central theme of the entire Bible.\nGod heard every time the enslaved Israelites cried out against the injustice they suffered in Egypt (Exodus 3:9), and He showed up in a visible pillar of cloud and fire to lead them on their journey out of captivity (Exodus 13:20–22).\nGod is before all things and holds all things together (Colossians 1:17), and He intercedes for me in wordless groans when even I don’t know how or what to pray (Romans 8:26–27).\nGod can’t be contained in any house built by human hands (1Kings 8:27; Acts 17:24), yet He walked off the dusty roads of Judea and into the homes of sinners, tax collectors, drunkards, and fisherman to eat and drink with them (Matthew 24:49; Luke 10:38–42; 19:1–10).\nAs you’ll discover in this reading plan, we were created for this kind of relationship with God—to live in His presence, experience His goodness, and enjoy Him all the days of our lives. God has always drawn near to His people, and even now, He invites us to draw near to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Jen Yokel\n\nOur holy God, through His grace and provision, welcomes imperfect people into His presence.\nOver the past few months, I’ve been fascinated by the life and writing of Julian of Norwich. As a 14th century English woman, Julian knew a thing or two about living in a chaotic world. From political turmoil to watching her community’s decimation by the Black Death, she no doubt sensed the fear of her world and heard the pains of her neighbors. I imagine as an anchorite, a woman living out her days secluded in a church yet still available to her community, her neighbors would have come to her. I picture her as a safe, motherly presence where they could confess their fears, vent their anger, and ask for prayer.\nYet for all this heaviness, here is a woman who could write these words: “All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well.”\nOver 600 years later, it is clear that all is still not well. This story stretches even farther back than the Middle Ages—the story of a people searching for the presence of God.\nLike Isaiah, we look upon God’s glory and despair at all we can never be (Isaiah 6:1–7). Like David, we ache to dwell with God and gaze on His beauty (Psalm 27:4). We talk about a Creator who is close to creation, maybe even catch a glimpse of Him in the laughter of loved ones or the roar of the ocean, yet we also read of the throne room in Revelation and wonder how we could survive such astonishing power (Revelation 4).\nWhat is this presence we all seek? What does it mean to find God when the world is in disarray and He feels unreachable?\nIn his letter to the Ephesians, Paul begins by reminding these faithful Christ-followers who they once were: without Christ, excluded and without hope (Ephesians 2:12). They were Gentiles, outsiders to Israel’s promises and citizenship, yet even that division, as Paul points out, is “done in the flesh by human hands” (v.11). God’s greater plan is a radical, cosmic hospitality, beginning and ending with a very real, human yet divine presence.\n“But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ” (Ephesians 2:13). In the mystery of grace, a Rabbi who loved, healed, laughed, wept, listened, and suffered also died and returned to life. He broke down the divisions between Jew and Gentile, slave and free, male and female, God and humanity. And in an even greater mystery, we become the dwelling place of God, each of us adding rooms to a living temple more glorious than the finest building in the world, a shelter from a world of plagues and turmoil and despair.\nGod’s presence, His dwelling, is no longer a place “out there” that we have to reach. It’s not an exclusive club or a far-off mountaintop. It is awe-inspiring, maybe even terrifying, and it is as close as skin and bone. It defies our human boundaries and looks like a parade of misfits who are grateful for a seat at the table. It is safety and warmth and family. All are welcome and there is always room for more, always a space to come in from the chaos and rest in the hope that all just might be well.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Patti Sauls\n\nWe can find courage and hope to endure all things because the powerful presence of our God goes with us.\nIt was over twenty years ago, but it feels like yesterday. Like clockwork, our first baby, Abby, would get fussy right before bedtime. Cue the footie pajamas, last bottle, diaper change, beloved blankie and a snuggle. I’d hold her close as she wriggled in my arms fighting sleep. Quietly, I would sing the familiar lullaby that my dad had sung over me: “Night, night, oh Abby. Sleepy tight, oh Abby. Close your eyes, oh Abby. Night, night, night, night… night.” Soon, her eyelids would get heavy, her breath would slow and deepen, and her little body would relax as she nestled into my chest.\nI wish I could wrap my head and heart around the fact that God holds me tight, that He loves me like this. Do we believe that God embraces us in our weariness? The prophet Isaiah insists that God is not remote or withdrawn. On the contrary, we need not fear because God is with us, He strengthens us, and He upholds us (Isaiah 41:10). Do we believe that God enjoys us and sings over us? Zephaniah 3:17 tells us, “The LORD your God is among you, a warrior who saves. He will rejoice over you with gladness. He will be quiet in his love. He will delight in you with singing.”\nGod is a warrior who saves. He fights for me and gives me refuge, strength, and help in times of trouble (Psalm 46:1). But it’s not only His powerful presence that gives me strength. His tender presence strengthens me too. Our God is a lullaby-singing warrior who loves His children.\nIsaiah reveals God’s deep tenderness by comparing Him to a shepherd: “He protects his flock like a shepherd; he gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them in the fold of his garment. He gently leads those that are nursing” (Isaiah 40:11). Our minds can’t fully grasp the reality of Almighty God stooping down to care for us in the messy, nitty-gritty of our daily lives. Yet we’re invited to see Him doting on us like a shepherd tending his needy sheep. This is how God has chosen to reveal Himself to us. He doesn’t merely tolerate us; He delights in us. He gathers us up in His arms, carries us close, and sings to us.\nYes, God is a fierce warrior fighting for His people and a singing warrior who delights in us and quiets us with His love. In this we find a nourishing strength that satisfies our souls. We can rest in His arms, close our eyes, and slow our breath as He sings over us. Instead of suffering our own pounding hearts, we can lean in and hear His steady heartbeat. It beats steadily with His love for us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Bailey T. Hurley\n\nWhen we remember God’s presence goes with us and before us, we can find comfort in any circumstance.\nWhen we walk through the desert seasons of our lives, anxious and uncertain if we will ever make it to a safe place of rest, will we believe God’s presence goes with us? And will His presence be enough to rescue us from our fears?\nIt was 2018 and my husband was out of town when I had my first anxiety attack. I had no idea what was happening to me—why my heart was racing, why I was so faint, why I could not gain composure over my breathing. Feeling totally alone and out of control, I called 911 at 2am. I was hoping the paramedics would come and save me from what felt like a heart attack, only to be given a “sorry” glance as the paramedics packed up and confirmed it was anxiety.\nMonths went by and I couldn’t sleep, drive my car, or be away from my two-year-old without having severe anxiety over a possible future anxiety attack. I was emotionally, physically, and spiritually exhausted; I questioned why God allowed this to happen and wondered when He was going to come and deliver me from this ongoing fear and give me His peace instead.\nIn Exodus 33, God’s people were in the desert wondering when God was going to deliver them from their circumstances. With the people anxious for answers, Moses pleaded with God to reveal the next step and to promise to go with them as they journeyed to the promised land. Moses knew he was not going to be successful if God’s presence was not with them. He wanted assurance from God that He would be with them despite the future hardships they were sure to encounter.\nAnd God answered, “My presence will go with you and I will give you rest” (Exodus 33:14). God didn’t promise a specific day upon which they would finally rest in their future home. He didn’t promise that nothing unpleasant would happen on their journey. Instead, He promised His presence, which is more than enough to give God’s people comfort through any challenging unknowns—a promise we still have today.\nI may not know what will trigger a future anxiety attack, but God’s presence goes with me and before me. “I fear no danger, for [He is] with me” and His guiding rod and staff comfort me along the way (Psalm 23:4)—this is a prayer I can pray with confidence knowing God is near.\nAs you wrestle with setbacks, fears, difficult circumstances, unexpected bad news, and seemingly unanswered prayers, may you find comfort in God’s presence. His presence will strengthen you to continue to hope and wait on His rest and His peace. “May the Lord of peace himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with all of you” (2Thessalonians 3:16).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kara Gause\n\nAs we focus our hearts and minds on Him, we become more aware of our ever-present God.\nSomeone once asked me to picture my ideal eternity: with everyone I love present and accounted for, healthy and satisfied and fulfilled, with all my favorite treats and ways to while away the hours (if such a time constraint exists in heaven). If I could have everything I’ve ever wanted or imagined wanting, but God was not there, would I still be happy? Was my idea of heaven still “heaven” if God was not there?\nHuh.\nNow, I knew what the “right” answer was—boy, did I—but if I’m really honest, the right answer brought me no comfort or peace and, while I’m ashamed to admit it, no honest-to-goodness joy. The truth is that, when I imagined actually being in the presence of God, in the same room with Him, so to speak, well, I felt a lot more comfortable with one of us being on the other side of the door. You know, we’re aware the other is there, and we’re “good”: I recognized my need for Him, and He went to the cross for me so that we could actually be in the same room together.\nForever.\nNeedless to say, that one question took me on a journey of really beginning to look for God, to seek out His person, to really know Him. Because if He laid out His life for me, for the joy of having me with Him for eternity (Hebrews 12:2), and yet I somehow still felt the need for separation and physical distance from Him, then that was a problem. I had a sense that He went to the cross for more than just the effort of making us “good” with one another.\nI realized that to “seek His face” I would have to seek Him out intimately (1Chronicles 16:11). And when I searched for Him, when I sought Him out with all my heart and all my soul (Deuteronomy 4:29), He showed Himself to be anything but indifferent toward me. Through His Word and by His Spirit and the testimony of His Church (Colossians 3:14–16), He led me to really see the passion that led Him to the cross to die for me: so we could be in the presence of one another unencumbered by my sin, because “the LORD [our] God is a compassionate God” (Deuteronomy 4:31). The reality is that He is always with me because He wants to be. That truth leaves me utterly awestruck, yet somehow, I’m still prone to forget.\nSo, are you like me: have you continued to allow your shame to close your heart off from true relationship with Him? Have you believed the lie that the one who died a vicious and humiliating death to save you is somehow indifferent toward you? Take Him at His Word: seek Him, and He’ll remind you of what is true.\nIf you have been brought back into God’s presence through the blood of Jesus, then His presence and holiness aren’t meant to cause trembling from a place of fear, but of excitement and anticipation that one day, not so long from now, we won’t have to search for Him because we will get to see Him face to face (1Corinthians 13:12). Until that day, we don’t have to settle for just being “okay” with God—we get to have relationship with Him. We can seek Him out because He wants to be found.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitie Stoddard\n\nGod created us to live and serve in His presence, but our sin made us unfit for life in the garden.\nRunning barefoot through soft, green grass was a quintessential part of my childhood summers. But when I moved to a desert climate as an adult, I learned that maintaining an inviting yard required a sprinkler system and a green thumb. Having neither, I struggled each summer to keep our landscape from turning dry and brown like the hills that surrounded us.\nMy battle with the vegetation each year is a consistent reminder that we are not living in the garden of Eden as God first designed it. Images of the Pacific Northwest, with their misty lakes and dense forests, may seem a little closer to that lush paradise on earth. But in our present state, when we dig beneath the surface, no place, person, or thing is truly perfect or whole anymore.\nI’m guessing most of us feel far from Eden. Whether it’s problems in our personal lives, the health of a family member, or devastation abroad, there is no shortage of brokenness here and now. But when we look back to the very beginning of creation, we learn that this suffering is not what God desired for His masterpiece.\nWe all know the story. When God made the earth, He “planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he placed the man he had formed” (Genesis 2:8). But we often miss the best part of the garden! It’s not the fertile ground or the naming of the animals, but the fact that God Himself walked among His people, in communion with them. God’s original intention was for men and women to live and serve in His presence.\nWhen Adam and Eve chose to sin by disobeying God, choosing their own way over His, the greatest consequence wasn’t pain in childbirth or a lackluster harvest, but separation from God’s presence. And that separation was banishment from Eden, death to the soul, and ultimately death to the body. When God first created the world there was no mention of death or destruction. It was only after humanity chose the way of sin that brokenness entered the scene.\nGod could have left it at that. Handing Adam, Eve, and every generation to follow, over to the downfall of our own decisions. But that is not who God is. God is merciful. God is love. And so, God sent His own perfect Son to be the man Adam could not. To live a righteous life, never choosing sin like we do. To be the spotless Lamb, sacrificed to atone for our damage. It was the greatest act of undeserved forgiveness, God giving Himself over to death to save the ones who’d betrayed Him.\nGod pays the price for our sin because He longs for complete connection with us once again, to walk in the garden with His creation. I cannot begin to fathom how deep His love is for us. But what I do know is that because of Jesus’s sacrifice we are welcomed back into the presence of God. Even in a land east of Eden, we can live and serve with God through His Holy Spirit. And for all who trust in Him, we will walk with our God in paradise again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nGod’s presence was with Moses and with Israel as they were brought out of slavery in Egypt.\nWhen Moses left Egypt, he had no map, no idea of which way to go, or what awaited him when he arrived. He had the presence of God to guide him, and he hedged his future (and that of the hundreds of thousands of Israelites who went with him) on the voice he heard in the wilderness, who appeared with a sweeping claim of authority and sovereignty:\n“This is what you are to say to the Israelites:I AM has sent me to you” (Exodus 3:14).\nThis story is a familiar one in Sunday school classes, Hollywood movies, and sermon illustrations. What I love about Scripture and these beloved stories is how many different lenses we can wear to examine them. While we could read this passage through Moses’s eyes, as I usually do, I believe it’s even more compelling to read it through the lens of God’s presence that was with Moses and His people.\nBeginning in Exodus 3, God reveals He has come to Moses because of the cries of His people: “Then the LORD said, “I have observed the misery of my people in Egypt, and have heard them crying out because of their oppressors. I know about their sufferings” (v.7).\nGod was there in Egypt, with His people. His omnipresence, His everywhere-ness, meant that He never left. And so when He called them out of Egypt to go behind Him into the wilderness, they followed. In Exodus 6, God identified Himself to Moses as the God who had been with his fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. His presence wasn’t new, but it was revealed in a new, personal way to Moses.\nGod directed the Israelites’ route, not “along the road toward the land of the Philistines, even though it was nearby” but “around toward the Red Sea” (Exodus 13:17–18). God wasn’t calling them out of oppression and then letting them stumble around, waiting for the stars to direct their steps; rather, He had a specific path for them to follow, one in which He would lead and they would have to learn to trust and follow Him.\nHis presence, provision, and promises are everywhere in this story. He was there, constantly providing for His people, whether defeating their enemies, sending manna and quail to nourish them, literally lighting their way, and more. He faithfully kept His promises to Moses.\nThis year, with its pandemic, politics, and personal tragedies, feels a little like the wilderness. I don’t know about you, but I would love a good map to show me how to navigate this season. Every road feels like a dead end these days, or maybe more of a roundabout that circles us around and around but never quite spits us out going in the right direction. None of the old paths work, and I’m not sure I want to go where these new paths are taking me.\nWhen God called Moses, He didn’t promise him an easy road. In fact, Moses himself never made it to the promised land. But God did promise Himself, His presence, and His perfect provision. He was always there. Today, I need to know that those promises, and God’s unfailing presence, are mine as well.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nLike Moses’s face made radiant by standing in God’s presence on Mt. Sinai, God’s people are transformed by life in His presence.\nWhen I read picture books about the garden of Eden to my children, I get asked a lot of questions about all the nakedness. “I can see Adam’s bottom!” my son shouts, knowing a cause for gleeful hilarity when he sees one. So, why were they naked? Genesis tells us there was no need for coverings because they were without shame (Genesis 2:25). In our original created state, our bottoms aren’t hilarious or embarrassing; they are what they are, which is to say, glorious hind ends. But the shame we experience as a result of our sin takes away our freedom. God’s holy and righteous presence can shine a light on our humiliation, but through the power of Christ, He has also taken away our shame and given us freedom from it. The presence of God’s perfect Son transforms us from shameful to glorious.\nMoses’s face was made radiant by standing in God’s presence on Mount Sinai. God prepared him, saying, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear when I speak with you and will always believe you” (Exodus 19:9). But the children of Israel did not want to see that nonsense; they were scared and unable to look Moses straight in the face (2 Corinthians 3:7; Exodus 34:30). They needed Moses to cover up the traces of glory lingering around his wrinkled eyes because it made them uncomfortable—it reminded them of their own shame and underscored the huge chasm between their own sin and a perfect, holy God (Exodus 34:33). But Moses had been transformed, and he didn’t even “realize that the skin of his face shone as a result of his speaking with the Lord” (v.29). This transformation is just a foreshadowing of the transformation we now experience through the life, death, and resurrection of Christ.\nFor if the ministry that brought condemnation had glory,the ministry that brings righteousness overflows with even more glory.In fact, what had been glorious is not glorious now by comparisonbecause of the glory that surpasses it. For if what was set aside was glorious,what endures will be even more glorious (2 Corinthians 3:8–11).\nThe old covenant of the law is only a shadow of our new and finished covenant in Jesus Christ. The glory of His presence is even more gloriously available to us who live in His covenant.\nHave you ever felt unable to discipline your children because of your own sin, worried that your own imperfection precludes you from upholding the rules in your own home? Have you ever felt ashamed to stand up for the truth of the gospel because you are ashamed of something you have done in the dark? The transforming power of Christ has set us free. We can leave our sin behind and walk forward with confidence in His presence. We are made free by His presence. Christ lifts the veil! Indeed, “where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom” (2 Corinthians 3:17).\nWe are a free people. By all means, wear pants, but walk forward leaving your sin and shame at the foot of Christ’s cross. The presence of the Lord equips us to do His good work without shame and fear. When you walk in His presence, the shame the world tries to pin on you can’t damage you. Let your face shine with His glory.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "God Dwells Among His People in the Tabernacle",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Erin Davis\n\nGod provided a place for His people to draw near to Him.\nWe live in the shadowlands.\nConsider the tabernacle, that place of awe and wonder described often in the Old Testament. From cherubim stitched into towering curtains to pillars overlaid with gold, the size and beauty of the tabernacle would have taken our breath away. Yet, inside all of that artistry and engineering was something (or Someone) even more spectacular: “They are to make a sanctuary for me so that I may dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8).\nSit in that thought for a moment. Let your imagination try to wrap itself around the fact that the God who spoke the stars into being (Isaiah 40:26), the One who sits enthroned above the circle of the earth (v.22), and measures the waters of the earth in the hollow of His hand (v.12), chose to dwell in a tent built by human hands. What could speak to God’s love for us and to His desire to be in relationship with us more than this? But as spectacular as the tabernacle must have been and as breathtaking as it would have been to see the cloud of God’s presence descend (Exodus 40:34), it was only a shadow of a coming, greater reality.\nJesus did more than descend in a cloud. He wrapped Himself in human flesh and walked among the people He’d made. Through Jesus, man experienced fellowship with God undivided by poles and curtains. Yet even as we read about the Son of God walking and talking with man in the Gospels, we’re still just seeing shadows. God’s desire to dwell among the Israelites in the portable tabernacle and Christ’s willingness to take on flesh and live among mankind both point forward to the ultimate, full union of God and His people.\nJesus Christ is both the High Priest and sacrifice that we need: holy, innocent, undefiled. In order to be with us, He died “once and for all time when he offered himself” (Hebrews 7:27). Our High Priest’s work is finished, and now He sits “down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a minister of the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that was set up by the Lord and not man” (Hebrews 8:1–2).\nYes, the earthly tabernacle was eventually destroyed. And Christ’s human body became His glorified body before He ascended to the right hand of the Father, but those long shadows trace back and extend forward into a time when “night will be no more; people will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God will give them light, and they will reign forever and ever” (Revelation 22:5). Everything we experience here on earth is merely a shadow of the greater, redeemed reality that is to come in the new heavens and the new earth. We can endure life in the shadows because we know a day is coming when we will fully dwell with Him, and He with us, forever.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "God’s Presence Fills the Temple",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nGod’s presence filled the temple, and His people drew near and worshiped Him.\nMy church has been going through a study of the psalms of ascent (Psalms 120–134), fifteen psalms tucked toward the back of the book that chronicle the journey the Israelites made to Jerusalem to worship God in the temple. Each week, as we study another, I feel each step of the journey anew, inextricably linked in this year with the long separation from public worship earlier this year. The psalmist says, “I rejoiced with those who said to me, “Let’s go to the house of the Lord” (Psalm 122:1). His longing echoes my own to worship and be near God in His house. It’s a theme that permeates the psalms of ascent, and my heart today.\nBut why?\nWhy did the temple mean so much to the Israelites, that together they would sing as they walked up its steps? Why did it hurt with every beat of their collective heart when the temple was destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 BC? Why was building a second temple on the foundations of the first so important to the Jewish people when they returned to Jerusalem from exile? (Ezra 1).\nWhy? Because God’s presence came and dwelt there.\nIn 1 Kings 8, the elders of Israel bring the ark of the covenant to rest in the inner sanctuary of the newly finished temple. The ark of the covenant symbolized the Lord’s ongoing presence with the Israelites (Numbers 7:89). Since their days with Moses at Mount Sinai, the ark had been on the move. Now, it was brought into a permanent structure—the temple. Once it came to rest in the most holy place, “the glory of the LORD filled the temple” (1Kings 8:11).\nKing Solomon then offers a prayer of dedication that is one of the most beautiful speeches in all of Scripture. It’s a visceral prayer that must have echoed through the meticulously-planned walls of the temple. On and on Solomon goes, listing and describing the many times and ways and places the people would come to commune with their holy God in His temple (vv.31–42). The temple was different, and Solomon’s prayer punches through scenario after scenario of when the people could come into God’s presence via the representative priests who could enter the most holy place. The temple was a reminder that God was dwelling among His people. And yet, it was still separated by a curtain into the holy of holies, where only the high priest could enter once a year.\nThat is, until Jesus came as the physical presence of God on earth. And when He ascended into heaven, the Holy Spirit came to commune with God’s people, to guide them and be present with them. And one day, when Jesus comes again and believers live with Him in the new Jerusalem, God will be present with no curtains, no barriers, no fear, and no death.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Erin Davis\n\nWhen God’s people turned away from Him, He removed His presence from the temple.\nThough the pages of Scripture contain many tragedies, the ones that stop my heart involve the loss of God’s presence. I think of Mary, who carried her Savior inside her womb, who studied the curve of His profile daily, who watched Him as He performed miracles. Then I try to imagine her at the foot of the cross. How could she find the strength to keep breathing when she pictured a future without Him near?\nI think of the disciples, who’d physically walked and talked with Jesus, and then had to wrap their minds around the fact that His body now lay lifeless in a tomb, shrouded in darkness. After they’d journeyed beside Jesus, how could they take a single step without Him?\nAnd I think of the Israelites, who experienced God’s presence as a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (Exodus 13:21), then stared with wide-eyed wonder as His glory filled the temple (1Kings 8:11).\nImagine the gut punch of hearing God’s righteous judgment on the sins of His people: “Has this house, which bears my name, become a den of robbers in your view? Yes, I have seen it too” (Jeremiah 7:11).\nI want to hold my breath as He declares: “I will banish you from my presence” (Jeremiah 7:15).\nMy heart aches when I read: “I will uproot Israel from the soil that I gave them, and this temple that I have sanctified for my name I will banish from my presence” (2Chronicles 7:20).\nAs I read these passages describing the loss of God’s presence, David’s prayer reflexively bubbles up: “Do not banish me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me” (Psalm 51:11).\nWhen panic about the loss of God’s presence makes our palms start to sweat, we need only to open our Bibles again. God doesn’t give and take His presence away willy nilly. True, because God is holy, our sin and God’s presence cannot co-exist. But let’s pause and remember the miracle of the cross: Because Christ’s death, we are welcomed into God’s presence wearing His righteousness—not our own failed attempts to achieve it.\nConsider God’s presence with renewed wonder today, friend. Thank Jesus again that He has made a way for you to be near Him. If you are a follower of Christ, you need not waste a single nanosecond worrying that you will be forced to live outside His presence again. Look no further than the gospel; because of Jesus, we can now experience the joy and eternal pleasures in our Creator God’s presence (Psalm 16:11).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "One Greater Than the Temple",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Bailey T. Hurley\n\nThe presence of God came to earth and dwelt among people in Jesus Christ.\nAs Christians, we live in a post-temple world. It is difficult to fully comprehend a faith that required trips to the temple to sacrifice pure, spotless animals to atone for sin. But until Jesus came to earth, that is exactly what God’s people did regularly to appease God.\nThere were so many rules and regulations around temple worship depending on the type of sin committed, which animal you could afford to offer, and on what occasion. As time passed, the rules and regulations surrounding temple worship were manipulated as priests and “money changers” took advantage of those coming to offer sacrifices to God (see John 2:13–21). These misinterpretations and eyebrow-raising exchanges at the temple couldn’t possibly be what He’d originally intended—no, this system needed a lasting solution. A solution that could only come from God Himself.\nThankfully, God had a plan for His people that far exceeded a temple sacrifice: a person who was going to outlast a building, God Himself in the person of Jesus. “The Word [Jesus] became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:14). And as Jesus’s ministry grew, religious leaders became frustrated when He proclaimed that He could forgive sins.\nThe problem? No more visits to the temple. No more making profit from the people’s sacrifice. No more laws to twist and turn for their own power and control. Now, Jesus declared “something greater than the temple” had come: “mercy and not sacrifice” (Matthew 12:6,7).\nBut how?\nJesus Himself became the final sacrifice. As He took His last breath on the cross, the curtain that separated people from entering into God’s presence in the temple “was torn in two from top to bottom” (Mark 15:38). Instantly, through faith, we have access to God through Jesus who died for our sins and presents us “holy, faultless, and blameless before him” (Colossians 1:22).\nEven though we live in a post-temple world, we often still cut ourselves off from the access we have to God through Jesus. We still put rules around our faith and offer up sacrifices of perfect church attendance, clean and uncomplicated relationships, and spotless pasts. Instead of graciously receiving Jesus’s gift of mercy and forgiveness, we try to earn it on our own and punish ourselves when we make mistakes.\nWe cannot forget that the presence of God came to earth and dwelt among humanity, not to condemn it but to save it (John 3:17). Instead of looking for ways to “[condemn] the innocent” (Matthew 12:7), Jesus had compassion for people. And He desired not just our physical sacrifice, but our entire lives.\nFor those who trust in Jesus, there is no more curtain in the temple separating us from God’s saving grace. Let’s turn to Jesus, who is greater than the temple, confess and repent of our sin, and give thanks for His everlasting sacrifice that has removed all barriers between us and our Creator God.\n\nWriter and speaker Bailey T.

    "devo_title": "The Pouring Out of God’s Spirit",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Scarlet Hiltibidal\n\nOn the day of Pentecost, God’s presence was poured out on believers.\nDo you ever try to conjure up a feeling? Maybe you’re like me, prone to, ahem, an overabundance of feelings at all times. But, though the feelings you have are mighty, sometimes they aren’t the right ones. Maybe you want to feel empathetic, but you feel defensive. You want to feel loving, but you feel selfish. You long to hunger for the Word of God, but the 2020 quarantine was long, and you “accidentally” downloaded apps like, say, TikTok. Ahem.\nSometimes we want to feel the right things but pursue them the wrong way. We want to want the Spirit, right? Of course. Because, like 2 Corinthians 3:17 reminds us, “Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.” But how can we have the Spirit and feel the freedom He brings when life is so full of distractions and pains and questions that get us wanting other things we didn’t want to want in the first place? How can we be people who embody the Spirit who lives inside of us?\nIn Acts 2, Peter quotes what was once spoken through the prophet Joel:\nAnd it will be in the last days, says God,that I will pour out my Spirit on all people;then your sons and your daughters will prophesy,your young men will see visions,and your old men will dream dreams (Acts 2:17; Joel 2:28).\nDid you notice that it’s God who does the pouring out? It’s God who IS the Spirit. God is and God pours out. We, on the other hand, are to receive. But we’re not going to recognize what is available to us if we’re distracted, looking at Instagram or news updates more than we’re looking to God.\nIn Isaiah 32, we’re reminded of the glorious benefit of being filled with God’s Spirit: “The result of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever” (v.17). We have the Spirit of God. We can be filled with the Spirit of God. We can have and experience His peace. We can live with “quiet confidence forever.” The Spirit who came upon the apostles “like that of a violent rushing wind” is available to all of us who follow Christ (Acts 2:2). We don’t have to conjure it up. We don’t have to strive forever for the feeling of Christlikeness. The Holy Spirit is being poured out. Open the Word. Obey its instruction. Focus on filling more than feeling, and remember this: the work of Jesus Christ has already made you pure. Your sins are already forgiven. You are loved. You are full of God’s power, God’s peace, God’s presence, God’s life, God’s hope. Wow.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nThe people of God are the temple of God; His presence is active in the Church.\nI daydream about real estate. While others might be prone to scroll Instagram, “window-shop” online, or have wanderlust—I find myself pulling up Zillow, just for fun. I search for real estate in remote parts of the country as well as on my own street. I slide through listing photos, imagining life within four different walls, as if somewhere out there, there’s a better place for me, some home where I’ll finally have real peace. And of course, a view. But in my soul, I know I’ll never find what I’m looking for out there. The building where I live is far less important than what’s being built inside of me.\nGod dwells in holy places. From the ark of the covenant, too precious for human hands to touch, to Solomon’s temple in all of its splendor, God chooses spectacular places to display His glory. But when Jesus came to earth, He did so to change the zip code of God’s powerful Spirit. No longer would we have to go somewhere else to find God. Thanks to Jesus’s work on the cross, God can now build something beautiful, holy and sacred right within me.\nIn 1 Corinthians 3, Paul begs Christians to remember this truth: “Don’t you yourselves know you are God’s temple and the Spirit of God lives in you?” (v.16). Unfortunately, when I was a child, these verses in Scripture were all too often weaponized as a message of shame, intended to wag a finger in my face and remind me to remain sexually abstinent. At the very heart, this message from Paul isn’t about rules, but about a powerful, holy relationship. Being a temple of the Lord isn’t about what I do, but about what God is already doing in me.\nPAUSE FOR A MOMENT, and think about that. God could have chosen any house, and He chose to live with me, in me, and through me. In a way, it’s as if God looked through all of Zillow, through all time, found my listing—with my broken spirit and my jealous impulses and my numb, unfeeling heart—and said, “I’ll take that house, thank you very much.”\nThe good news is that God is a master renovator. He refuses to leave my heart the way He found it. Just like any good house, it only feels like home once you’ve put your personal touch on every wall. The Architect of the Universe knows what walls to tear down. He paints the walls of my soul with His peace, compassion, tenderness, and kindness. When I embrace the power that lives inside me, I can live in response to the Spirit’s heartbeat rather than my own impulses.\nConstruction is messy and we are all unfinished. But the good news—perhaps the best news—is that God promises to finish everything He starts (Philippians 1:6). And He’ll live here with me, in the mess, at work until that day comes.\n\n",

I have three sink basins, in the first I rinse, the second is filled with hot soapy water for washing, and the third has a special hot faucet for rinsing. Above the sink, mounted to the wall, are four big drying racks. Everything smells like lemon and optimism. Once my dishes are shiny and dripping on the metal racks, a child has usually brought in one last bowl and spoon. After that, someone finds a stray coffee cup, and before my dishes have dried, the first sink is full again with ladles, milk glasses, and unnecessary straws.\nOur work is never done on this side of heaven. The dishes will never be done. Life is better when I don’t expect a full stop from things that do not stop. The garden does not stay weeded. The beds need to be made every morning. It’s the same regardless of your station in life, the color of your skin, or the size of your bank account. Wealth does not bring happiness. Look at King Solomon in Ecclesiastes, who had limitless wealth, massive power, hundreds of women, and access to any imaginable pleasure the world had to offer. And yet his conclusion, after wearing out every fleshly gratification he could think of, was that it’s all vanity, all just wind and nothing. “All things are wearisome, more than anyone can say” (Ecclesiastes 1:8). And if that guy, with all his resources, found that our hope is not found under the sun, do you think that you’re going to discover something different?\nNow, don’t misunderstand me, the fresh glory of a sunrise over mountains and the squishy skin of a new baby and the arms of my husband all hold a true and inexpressible joy for me. The beauty of the world and its people is for our joy. But none of it will satisfy our deepest longings. None of it will make us complete. In the world, no matter how much we love the smell of lemon, there will always be dishes to wash, and our favorite ones will continue to break, and our dogs will die, and our houses will burn, and we will bury everyone we love until they bury us.\nBut there is a land where there is no death, no sickness, no depravity, and no shame. And, boy, I hope we will see our pets, because there’s a good girl I sure wish I could see again. We will lay down our tools and run home, into the arms of our Father. He has promised us this: “Look, God’s dwelling is with humanity, and he will live with them. They will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them and will be their God” (Revelation 21:3).\nOne day, in the new heaven and new earth, God will dwell with His people as He did in the beginning. We were created for life in our holy God’s presence. Our sin keeps us from coming close to Him. But He comes to us and brings us home. There we find our settled rest, not like guests or strangers, but like a child who is truly home (Psalm 23).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Jen Yokel\n\nFrom the call of Abram to our inclusion as spiritual descendants, God’s promises to His people are marked by His presence.\nJacob had blown it. Maybe he felt shock and relief that he’d actually pulled it off, convincing Esau to surrender his birthright. Maybe he felt the knot of remorse in his gut as he laid down under the stars with a stone for a pillow. Perhaps he tossed and turned a little, regretting and second-guessing, as he drifted off to sleep as the new bearer of the family promise, his dreams filled with light and color.\nAngels! Climbing a ladder, up and down. Hearing a voice his father and his grandfather spoke of so fondly, declaring, “I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac” (Genesis 28:13). And that same voice was repeating a litany of promises: good land, countless descendants who would bless the whole world (Genesis 28:10–22).\nThis promise wasn’t new. His father Isaac heard it when God told him to stay in a strange land and trust Him through a famine (Genesis 26:1–6). Years before, this same promise led Abraham away from everything he’d known in Haran (12:1–7), and he would continue to hear it for the rest of his life (17:1–8).\nI can’t help but wonder about the apparent silences in between, the years of living off strange land and living with family who sometimes stirred up more trouble than blessing. In the midst of unfulfilled plans, God’s voice remained constant, repeating the promise. God still appeared, again and again, to unlikely, fallible people.\n“Look, I am with you,” God assures Jacob as the ladder evaporates into the space between dreaming and sunrise. “I am with you, and will watch over you wherever you go” (Genesis 28:15).\nMost of us aren’t holding out for a plot of land and kings in our family tree, but I wonder if the land was even the point. Over and over, as God repeated His promises, these men continued to live colorful lives, listening to God yet failing, repenting, and then breaking relationships, only to come home limping in shame—quite literally, in Jacob’s case.\nIsn’t that all of us, though, in the great spiritual family of Abraham? We may not trace our blessings by bloodline, but we find them in Jesus, the one who lived a blameless life that only Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob could dream of. Jesus is the one who came to be God’s presence among us, showing us the way, sealing the promise, and blessing the whole world through His life, death, and resurrection.\nCenturies after Abraham gazed at the stars and left his homeland behind, a former fisherman and friend of Jesus would repeat the promise one more time: “You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your ancestors, saying to Abraham, ‘And all the families of the earth will be blessed through your offspring’” (Acts 3:25).\nThe ultimate blessing is so much more than land, power, influence, or wealth. The blessing is found in Jesus, “God with us” (Matthew 1:22–23), living and dying and defeating death to reunite His family and live with us forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitie Stoddard\n\nGod calls His people to take part in establishing His kingdom on earth, and His presence secures our victory.\nI played on a smattering of different sports teams growing up. Soccer, volleyball, basketball—I tried them all at some point or another. And while I loved athletics, I was never the “star player” of a team. You know that kid who seems like they were born to swim laps or shoot a three-pointer? I wasn’t that kid, but I got to play on teams with that kid. And having an exceptionally talented athlete on your team is a blessing, because their strength becomes your team’s strength.\nWhen I think of God’s power, I think of Him like that star player who carried the rest of our team on to victory. Sure, everyone got to participate during the game, but make no mistake, there would be no “win” if God didn’t show up to make the plays and set the strategy. Honestly, He could win every single game by Himself, but He graciously chooses to involve and work through other players.\nThe thing is though, in our daily lives God is often an unseen force leading our team. And so we can make the mistake of thinking we need to be the star player or maybe even call some of the shots. Perhaps we feel God prompting us to help build His kingdom in a specific way, but then we think all the pressure rests on our shoulders. Let me tell you from experience, that is a recipe for disaster. Either we will become prideful and think we really are the star of the show and take all the credit that God deserves, or we will become fearful, knowing we cannot measure up, causing us to spiral into discouragement.\nThe book of Joshua reminds us that it is through God’s power, not our own, that His kingdom is built. God directed Joshua to lead the Israelites into the promised land. It was natural for them to be afraid as they stepped onto unknown soil with enemies around every corner, but God continually reassured His people that He would never leave them. He would show up for the game. They only needed to trust and obey. God would carry them to victory, and they would get to participate in the celebration.\nJust as God encouraged the Israelites to be “strong and courageous,” He encourages us to do the same. In every good work the Lord has called us to, we must not forget that “the LORD [our] God is with [us] wherever [we] go” (Joshua 1:9). It does not all rest on our shoulders. In fact, God doesn’t need us to accomplish His purposes. We should neither be arrogant nor insecure. Instead, we can be grateful we get to play on the winning team, taking part in the thrill of a game well won, and celebrating the victory that God has already secured. While we work passionately, we no longer sweat the outcome because we know that in the end, God always wins.\nWhen Christ went down to the grave and rose up victorious, not even death could defeat Him. Just as we join with Christ in His death, we will one day join with Him in resurrection (Romans 6:5). As Paul says, nothing can separate us from the love of God (Romans 8:39), and that is the greatest prize of all.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Walking in God’s Presence",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nWe are called to follow Jesus and walk with Him daily, learning about life in His kingdom.\nEarlier this year, I started taking long walks at a local park. Because it was springtime, the surrounding fields were vibrant and the aroma of honeysuckle lingered in the air. These walks became my evening pilgrimage. No matter how restless my heart and body became during the day, this steady, put-one-foot-in-front-of-the-other rhythm of movement restored me to balance by the end of each mile. Disharmony and agitation were exchanged for peace and surrender.\nDuring a lonely three months, Jesus kept me company on these walks. I’ve always felt closest to God in nature, and there’s something about the art of walking that draws me in even closer. Maybe it’s the sights along the way or the forward movement itself that feels like taking action. Whatever the reasons, I feel invited into something—into new ways of seeing and being that are unlike what I experience sitting under a cozy blanket or at a cherry-red stoplight.\nWalking with God isn’t limited to the act of walking, though. After all, what about those who don’t have that physical capacity? Walking with God is about accepting the invitation to keep company with Him. As we intentionally keep company with our Savior, we become more aware of His presence and learn to move to the rhythms of His love.\nWhen Jesus walked along the Sea of Galilee, He called out for Peter and Andrew to follow, and the disciples “immediately… left their nets and followed him” (Matthew 4:20). This was an invitation into companionship with Jesus. It was an invitation into new ways of seeing and being. It required action—and not just from their feet but also from their hearts.\nJesus also called out to John and his brother James, the son of Zebedee (Matthew 4:21). He then drew those from the regions of Galilee, Jerusalem, the Decapolis, Judea, and the Jordan (v.25). You might call Him a collector of people because of how His presence compelled others to follow. Of course, this wasn’t a lust for attention; it was because there was something about Jesus’s company that transformed people.\nIt’s easy to grow distant and inattentive to Jesus’s presence. But because the Holy Spirit inhabits us, we know that God never leaves us. We can’t escape Him, but we can walk toward things that draw us away. This is why Jesus said, “Remain in me, and I in you” (John 15:4). Walking with awareness of God brings us intimacy and abundant life that just isn’t possible apart from a relationship with Him.\nThere will always be activities and anxieties that feel urgent. I hope we learn the slow, steady practice of walking with our God every hour of the day because it’s here that we grow in our relationship with Him and learn the rhythms of His love. Whatever our hands find to do, I hope we carry a willingness to drop our nets when He calls and keep company with Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nGod is always present with believers always through the Holy Spirit.\nA few months ago, we planted two blackberry bushes in our backyard. Since he doesn’t quite understand the concept of “ripeness,” my two-year-old son often walks to the plot and picks off a green or yellow raspberry, only to drop it with disappointment into the soil. “You can’t pick them when they’re green,” I tell him. “They need to stay on the vine.”\nGod’s presence is a mysterious concept. At times, I’ve felt His closeness like a breath on my cheek. Other times, I’ve had to trust that His nearness is truth—regardless of my emotions or sensations. If I trust Jesus, then I must take Him at His Word, and He tells me over and over again through Scripture that He will not leave me behind, He will always be present, and even when He is not physically present, that the Holy Spirit will stand in the gap. God’s presence in my life is like the nutrients that move from soil through the vine into an unripe raspberry. Cut off from the source, nothing blooms. Cut off from His presence, I will be nothing but wasted potential.\nOften, I can be tricked into believing that in order for me to experience God’s presence, I need a plush upholstered chair, a window that emits plentiful natural light, a cup of just-brewed coffee, a journal, a good pen. Silence. But God is present with me, even when I am not aware of Him. And if God is always with me, then He is with me in the chaos of the day, just as much as He is in the precious moments of morning quiet. In the Great Commission, Jesus is sending His closest friends into oppositional territory, to places where they will be persecuted, hunted, and ultimately, killed. And despite that terrifying reality, Jesus promises them: “I am with you always” (Matthew 28:20).\nJesus is with you too—today, yesterday, and forever. No matter what you’re facing. No matter the sorrow past or present, He is here, grieving with us, celebrating with us, growing and filling us with His Spirit, and helping us take steps forward with hope.\nThere is no check-list of solitude or calm required for God’s presence to attend to your weary soul. He is here, now. He is with you, always. His presence flows into your heart, whether you feel it or not, whether you see it or not. All you must do is stay on the vine.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Patti Sauls\n\nIn Christ, our place in God’s presence is secure. We cannot be separated from His love.\n“Hey, Patti! So glad you’re here.”\nI’ll never forget how Sue, my high school ministry leader, greeted me the first time we met. Even though I had heard a lot about her from my friends, I still felt shy as we walked up her driveway and swung open the back door without even knocking. My friends made themselves right at home, searching Sue’s refrigerator for soda that she always kept well stocked, and plopping down on her kitchen stools. In walked Sue, laughing at our unannounced arrival and welcoming us all. Before I could awkwardly introduce myself, she greeted me by name.\nHearing Sue call me by name spoke to my longing to be known and stirred my hope for belonging. It meant the world to my insecure, 15-year-old self, and it means the world to me now. Little did I know that we would spend hours together, that she would share her life stories with me, and that she would explain the meaning of Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection to me. Little did I know that Sue and I would become friends for life.\nHearing Jesus describe Himself as the “good shepherd” also stirs my hope for belonging. His shepherd metaphor stops me in my hustling tracks and tugs at my solitary heart. “I am the good shepherd,” Jesus says. “The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep” (John 10:11). This shepherd doesn’t merely offer the bare minimum; He offers His life. He is ready and willing to die in order to protect His sheep from attack. Jesus also says that the good shepherd “calls his own sheep by name and leads them out” (v.3). He doesn’t casually regard the flock as a random collection of animals. He leads them out to pasture where He satisfies their hunger and thirst. Not only that, but He knows each one intimately, and He calls them by name.\nDo we hear Jesus’s voice? Do we hear His promises? Jesus promises the ultimate belonging: to be fully known and fully loved by Him forever. He says to every one of His followers, “I see you. I know you intimately. I know your deepest hunger and thirst. I love you. I will provide for you and protect you, even if it means laying down my life.” And, it did—it cost Him everything—Jesus died to divinely and decisively deal with the sin that separates us from God. He died once and for all so that we can be united with Him forever.\nEven though it is hard for us to imagine life without end, this is His promise: “I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand” (John 10:28). Jesus protects His flock and seals the deal for those who hear Him and follow. “Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord” (Romans 14:8). He calls each by name to be with Him and to become friends for life—both now and for eternity.\n\n",
