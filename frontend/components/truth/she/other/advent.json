        "devo_summary": "\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nJesus Christ is the Alpha and Omega of the Bible. He is the constant theme of its sacred pages; from first to last they testify of Him. At the creation we at once discern Him as one of the sacred Trinity; we catch a glimpse of Him in the promise of the woman’s seed; we see Him typified in the ark of Noah; we walk with Abraham, as He sees Messiah’s day; we dwell in the tents of Isaac and Jacob, feeding upon the gracious promise; we hear the venerable Israel talking of Shiloh; and in the numerous types of the law, we find the Redeemer abundantly foreshadowed. Prophets and kings, priests and preachers, all look one way — they all stand as the cherubs did over the ark, desiring to look within, and to read the mystery of God’s great propitiation.—Charles H. Spurgeon\nThere is just something about the Advent season. \nI love a good set of flannel pajamas, a crackling fire, wassail simmering on the stovetop, and the nothing-like-it glow of the Christmas tree—all while the nostalgic sounds of Vince Guaraldi’s piano fill the air with memories of Christmases long past, before we were old enough to buy gifts.\nThe music and the ambiance would be wonderful even if we were experiencing them for the very first time, but what really makes them special—what makes the season really sing—is we did it this way last year, too. Or, because I remember this smell of spiced cider from when I was a child. The layering of tradition adorns this season like no other. Even our decorations tell a story. Carefully and expectantly, we lift each ornament out of its packaging, remembering the Christmas it was given to us, or what it looked like hanging from our mother’s tree. \nThis is what I love about traditional Advent scriptures. Like that box of ornaments we pull out of the attic, we unpack the familiar verses, one at a time. Weary world that we are, we read the ancient truth once more—a prophecy first, a promise after that—to remember again why we needed Christmas. Each passage builds on the last, telling a story and adorning our season, building an eagerness within us for the moment we stand at the scene of the nativity and rejoice that this is the night of our dear Savior’s birth. \nOur holy God incarnate is the thrill of hope the world was waiting for, and He is the One we wait for once again.\nWhether you are brand new to the story of Jesus’s birth, or you grew up lighting Advent wreaths and reciting Luke 2 from memory, our prayer is that the Scripture in this book would feel like home to you. From the first promise of the Messiah to the moment Jesus is presented in the temple, we pray that you will sense the quiet, unmistakable thrill of hope that is yours because the Son of God became a baby. \nThere is just something about this season, friends. And we are honored to unpack the Advent story with you. \n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nRecently, the New York Times published a story about the rise of anxiety among tech entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. These young executives believed that the technology they created would help save the world. But if the news is any indication, their technology hasn’t made good on that promise. In response, many sought counseling and benefited from therapy. And in the end, they turned back to what they do best—creating apps to help connect patients to therapists, the way dating apps connect strangers for blind dates. The article put it this way: “The cure for tech’s ills, they hope, is more tech.”\nThe truth is, I’m not all that different from those executives in Silicon Valley. I have blemishes on my face, so I buy some weird cream that promises to help clear my skin. When that makes me break out even more, I venture back to the store to find another snake oil to clear up the problem. And so on and so forth, ad nauseum, until my bathroom drawers are full of expensive products, none of which actually work. I double down on a solution that will never be a solution, refusing to embrace the truth: I need help. I need rest. The world needs saving, and we’ve looked everywhere, but we can’t find the savior. \nLuckily, God hasn’t left us on our own. And if we seek in the right places, we will find. Not a technological solution to our problems and our anxieties, not a fix-all for our circumstances, not an acne-clearing miracle drug, or a cancer-curing one either. If we seek in the right places, we will find something far more true and valuable than all of those things. If we seek, we will find Him (Matthew 7:7). And He is what we need. \nIsaiah 55:6 says, “Seek the LORD while He may be found; call to him while he is near.” The good news is that He isn’t hard to find. Where do I seek God? In His Word. In His Church. In the presence of the things Jesus tells us He loves—with children, the marginalized, the oppressed, the poor, the broken, and the lost.\nAnd when I seek Him, what do I find? I find truth: God tells me I was known before I was even born (Psalm 139). God tells me that my life was not a mistake. That I am not defined by my worst day, that when I repent, He is ready and willing to forgive and lavish on my self-inflicted wounds the salve of holy compassion. God says that I can call to Him, and better yet, that He will answer (Jeremiah 33:3). \nHis greatest answer of all was in sending His Son Jesus—God with skin on—to show us what He is like (Hebrews 1:3). Jesus says He is gentle. Jesus says He is humble (Mark 10:45; John 5:19). Jesus says if I allow Him to be my teacher, I will find rest for my soul (Matthew 11:28–29). Is there anything a soul needs more than rest?\nHere is my prayer: Lord, let us not double down on our own powerless strategies to infuse life with meaning. This Advent season, in the glow of holiday lights and festivities, help us focus on You and seek You above all else, and You alone. Amen.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Erin Davis\n\nIt may not make your list of top ten favorite Christmas passages, but right here in Genesis, on the first few pages of God’s Word, we see Him—Jesus, our Savior. Evil was there, too, first slithering toward humanity as a serpent with a single goal: to tempt God’s beloved children to question the authority of their Maker. And what followed doesn’t exactly make for a pretty Christmas card. \n\nSin.Destruction.Separation.Devastation.Grief. \nThe Advent season gives us an opportunity to acknowledge the ache that has remained since this moment in the garden. The collateral damage of sin and destruction, separation and devastation and grief persist, even now at the “most wonderful time of the year.” Maybe you’re reading this and thinking, Sheesh, Scrooge! Didn’t you get the message about all things merry and bright? I did, believe me. I am so grateful for this season of wonder. Yet, for Christmas to have its full effect on my heart—on my life—I choose to sit, for now, in the reality that sin still exists. If I skip that step, my longing for a Savior inevitably ebbs, and the meaning of Christmas is lost to lesser things. \nAs I wait with expectation to consider again the miracle of Christmas morning, Genesis 3 reminds me that this season is not just about a baby in a manger, but about a Savior on a cross. The gift of God’s Son loses its impact without knowing the entirety of God’s redemptive plan. This season we celebrate that Jesus not only came to live with us—He came to save us from the tyranny of the serpent, of evil itself. Genesis 3 reminds us that as soon as sin began distorting the human heart, the gospel was proclaimed. As God handed down the curse, He started with the serpent. \n“He will strike your head,  and you will strike his heel” (v.15). \nRight here in Genesis, before Gabriel visited Mary, before the shepherds witnessed the night sky filled with the heavenly host, at the epicenter of sin’s power, the Messiah was promised. \nIt’s true that the enemy keeps nipping at the heels of those who bear Christ’s image. Advent isn’t about pretending our world isn’t broken. But way back in the garden, when Satan took his first shot at the image-bearers of God, Christ proclaimed the victory. At the cross, Jesus delivered the promised death blow that forever loosened Satan’s grip on the hearts of man. \nWithout understanding our sin and brokenness, we would not know the goodness of the gospel that caused the angels to sing. In this Advent season, and every season, may we remember God has always been—since the very beginning—heaven-bent on our redemption.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nA few weekends ago, we went on a family stargazing field trip with my eldest daughter’s class. She attends a school with an incredibly diverse population, racially and socioeconomically, with the goal of the student body looking as much like heaven as possible. Gathered around a bonfire, we worshiped together and counted the stars above, s’more residue all over our hands and faces—the moment was almost too beautiful to bear. \nWhen reading God’s promise to Abram again today, I juxtaposed that promise with the image of all those little kids, eyes open and singing, “Father, I Adore You,” with all their different colors of skin and families of origin and cultural traditions. God told Abram, “All the peoples on earth will be blessed through you” (Genesis 12:3), even though at the time, Abram’s world was very small. Still, God painted a picture for him using the stars that fill the hundred billion galaxies in the sky. \nCan you imagine the weight of that moment that seemed to bear the salvation of the world? Do you think, with his barren wife and in his old age, Abram looked at the infinite stars and wondered, How could this possibly be true? But somehow Abram (whose name God changed to “Abraham” in Genesis 17) did believe. He trusted God, and acted in faith (Genesis 15:6). And each time a new twist in the road appeared, he continued on in faith. Ur? Been there. Egypt? Did that. Painful obedience and personal sacrifice? In faith, Abram started down that path too—he knew the end of his story. He believed that he and Sarai would have a son, and through that son would come blessing for the whole world. But Abram never did get to see the plan from A to Z; he made it from A to C or perhaps D. He never saw God’s plan come fully into fruition, but he believed it most definitely would be accomplished because God keeps His promises. \nAs we read through God’s Word this Advent season, we’ll see the rest of the plan unfold through radical and ordinary acts of faith orchestrated by God to bring about not just that joyous Christmas morn, but also the redemption of the world. Advent often feels like a daily stepping out in faith, believing and trusting more than knowing. We know the end of our story, but we turn the page of each day without knowing what hardships or challenges or joys await us in between. \nAs each day of this season passes, my prayer is that I will embrace each day as it comes, in faith. I know what God has promised: the fulfillment of His kingdom, the end of all tears, the everlasting peace and reign of Jesus. But each day requires faith and hope, anchored in God’s Word and the work of the Spirit. It so often feels like I am Abram, staring up at the infinite starry sky, asking, How could this possibly be true? It’s true because God’s promise to Abram came true when his son, Isaac, was born, establishing a long genealogy that would lead to the birth of Jesus Christ. It’s true because that baby was born, and He is Immanuel, God with us. \n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nThis has been a really anxious season for me. We bought a tiny house on some acreage in hopes of lowering our debt and expenses. We thought we were geniuses. We shared a lot of congratulatory high fives. Five months later, we are still not moved in, and renovating has cost us so much more than we’d ever imagined. Today, we are not high fiving—we are weary. I know that everything will be okay in the end. But in the meantime, the terror we feel after paying yet another big bill has revealed our false sense of security rooted in how much money we’ve managed to put away in the bank. \nBut the hope of the gospel and the promise of Christmas is a peace that endures no matter what is happening around us in the physical world. The Spirit of the Lord promises hope, courage, wisdom, and understanding. We must run to the source of true peace. Apart from God, it’s not possible for us to have security that transcends our circumstances. I am not brave enough to build a house, raise children, or even get up every morning with a cheerful heart. I’m just not. And you aren’t either. Neither was King David—the man after God’s own heart (1 Samuel 13:14; 2 Samuel 7:8-16). Still, we have something beautiful that that enables us to hope in the midst of all harrowing days: the Spirit of the Lord. \nWhen things looked bleak, when it looked like the the line of David had shrivelled down to a burnt stump, there was still great hope: “Then a shoot will grow from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots will bear fruit” (Isaiah 11:1). The promise given to David of the coming heir to his kingdom is also the promise of an eternal kingdom, an eternal home, an eternal security. It is a kingdom built, not by men, but by the King of kings. And it is not funded by our paltry bank accounts, nor is it laid out according to our finite schemes. Isaiah prophesied about this King, the coming Messiah:\n“The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him—a Spirit of wisdom and understanding,  a Spirit of counsel and strength, a Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD” (v.2). \nEven in the midst of the joy of Christmas holiday, money is going to get tight, relationships are going to get strained, and inevitably, someone is going to pull out their back or suffer some other sort of injury. Instead of being whipped around by the insecurities of the world and our daily circumstances, let us put on the Spirit of the Lord and rest in His security. His perfect peace endures and sustains us as we learn to trust in Him.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nCan you remember a time when you didn’t rely on digital navigation? I remember the disorienting feeling of needing directions during my childhood summer family road trips. Although my dad has an impressive sense of direction, we would occasionally get lost. We’d pull our car into a rest area (or better yet a Dairy Queen), and unfold the crumpled, unwieldy paper map across the dashboard. My children can’t imagine such inefficient, old-fashioned practices. Now, we depend on digital apps to get us where we’re going and back home again. \nYet, we still need direction. Like Hansel and Gretel in Grimm’s fairy tale, we need a trail of breadcrumbs to lead us back home. In both massive and small ways, we all get lost in life. Throughout the books of the Bible, God unfolds a roadmap of sorts, gives us directions, introduces us to people and places along the way, and reveals our ultimate destination. \nIn Micah 5, we pick up the trail of breadcrumbs in ancient Israel about 700 years before the birth of Jesus. At this time, God’s chosen nation of Israel is not flourishing—it is floundering. The people are internally wrecked by sin and unfaithfulness to God and His commands. What’s more, they are externally threatened by foreign attacks. The brokenness is profound and painful.\nMicah’s prophetic words are full of judgment and woe, yet he punctuates his message with hope; all is not lost, because a redeemer will be born! Micah makes the unlikely prediction that in the small, seemingly insignificant town of Bethlehem, a savior-ruler will emerge. He will “shepherd them in the strength of the LORD, in the majestic name of the LORD his God” (Micah 5:4). In other words, He will be fully aligned and faithful to God, not alienated and rebellious like Israel. This Redeemer will rule in power and will extend the very peace of God. \nEven though Israel was rejecting God and suffering the devastating consequences of their choice, God continued to preserve His people and provide a gracious path of deliverance. Through the words of the prophet Micah, God announced the birth of not only the hope of Israel, but the hope of the world: Jesus, our eternal hope, ruler and Redeemer. \nThis trail of breadcrumbs has us looking back to the little town of Bethlehem, which literally means “the house of bread.” And God’s navigation leads us forward to Jesus, the bread of life (John 6:35). Is it a coincidence that these breadcrumbs lead us back to the house of bread? Is it a coincidence that they direct us forward to Jesus, who is the bread of life? Of course not! God strings these details together to make it undeniably clear where we can go when we’re lost and hungry. By pointing us to Jesus, our Redeemer from Bethlehem, God is showing us the way home.\n\nPatti Sauls lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband Scott and daughters, Abby and Ellie, where they serve alongside the people of Christ Presbyterian Church.

Assuming the boy will name some famous legend, he is surprised when, instead, August answers with this: \n“Found.” \nOut of everything he could be in the world, this frenzy-haired orphan boy just wanted to be with his parents. He wanted to be found. \nI’m sure we all connect with this in some way. You may feel isolated within your community. Or like you’re in professional limbo and just want the right person to “discover” you. Maybe you’ve never had someone by your side during Advent, and you feel the ache of loneliness—an ache that all the steaming wassail and woolen scarves in the world cannot comfort. The good news is this ache of loneliness is the very thing Advent answers. During these times of waiting, we can find a unique intimacy with God that comes from feeling our lack. The even better news is that Advent—a season full of longing—ends in the birth of the God who is with us.\nOur hero verse for today is a great comfort. We’re told “the virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and they will name him Immanuel, which is translated ‘God is with us’” (Matthew 1:23). His nearness is in this very name! \nThroughout Scripture, we’re given a picture of God drawing close to His people. In the Old Testament, He reveals Himself through pillars of smoke and fire, and speaks through prophets and angels. In the New Testament, He meets us through His incarnate Son—truth enfleshed—and He places His Spirit inside us. In sending His Son, our good Father gave us the chance to meet “God with skin on,” leaving us without question of His desire to know and be known by us. \nWe all long to be found, like the lonely street musician on the corner. Thanks be to God, He found us. He wants to heal and awaken our hearts because of His great love for us (1 John 4:10). Let’s go out of our way to embrace this time of longing because, strange as it may seem, it’s better to ache and draw close to Jesus than to feel an illusion of satisfaction and far from Him. Hallelujah! Immanuel, God is with us. \n\nBailey Gillespie is a California native who moved to Nashville to pursue a new adventure.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nMy first semester of college, a friend invited me to a teaching and worship service. I went, and was stunned by the beauty of singing old hymns set to new tunes and hearing the gospel preached like I never had before. I had always been a “good Christian kid,” but that identity was based on following the rules. I can specifically point to the moment when my heart changed, and I understood how wrong I’d been. It was when we sang this hymn:\nCome, ye weary, heavy laden, Bruised and broken by the fall; If you tarry ’til you’re better, You will never come at all. Not the righteous, not the righteous; Sinners Jesus came to call.\nIt shook the foundation I had been standing on for so long: follow the rules, don’t sin, and then God will love you. It said, quite simply, the opposite of that: Come, when you feel like you can’t or shouldn’t, because He has done all the work for you… and wants you anyway. Even now, typing the words, my breath catches in my throat. Could this really be true? \nRomans 8 tells us that “there is now no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus … What the law could not do since it was weakened by the flesh, God did” (vv.1,3). We stand before God, wearing the righteousness of Christ, not by our own doing but because of His life, death, and resurrection. Now, there is no condemnation. None. Not tomorrow, or the next day, or when we “figure things out,” or “do enough” to make ourselves worthy of His love.\nRereading the law in Exodus 20 today is sobering; I break those commandments by the day, and sometimes the hour. I covet as often as I breathe. I serve all sorts of idols, material and spiritual. I lie and cheat, in small ways and seemingly insignificant circumstances: “I’ll be there in 10 minutes,” I type, when my GPS says I’m 15 minutes away. I want them to think I’m responsible, that I have it together, I think to myself, trying to justify my actions.\nMy sin is double-edged: despite knowing the law, I break it, though I could never follow it anyway. The cycle of sin is endless, because we can never get out of the mire by ourselves. The law reveals our sinful nature, and we cannot do what it takes to follow it. We are sinful, and the law is a mirror that reveals our sin to us as if it were a stain on a shirt. But there is nothing we can do to remove that stain. \nAnd so Jesus came and fulfilled the law perfectly, because of God’s great love for us (Ephesians 2:4–5). What Jesus says regarding the law in Matthew 5 is particularly important, because Jesus “did not come to abolish but to fulfill” the law (v.17). The law still matters, but it does not have the last word—Jesus does. \nThis is the hope we have during Advent, and all year long. Because our hope is in Jesus and not our ability to follow the law, we do not have to tarry or wait until we have it all together. That day will never come. But by His Spirit, we can come freely when He calls. \n\n",

Of course, we all desperately want to be included in the “right” group, because who wants to be left out at recess or have no place to sit at lunch?\nThough we might not admit it, as we grow up, most of us continue to sort people—we just use fancier labels. Perhaps even in the Church we have mental categories for the godly or ungodly, well connected or unknown, engaged or distant. Though we’re not worried about being mocked on the playground, we still desperately want to be included in the “right” group.\nSo what do we do? We try to prop ourselves up on our accomplishments. We join the right Bible study, associate with the right people, do the right thing. And when we think we’ve done it all “right,” we look out from our little throne we’ve built for ourselves and judge everyone who is doing it “wrong.”\nPaul addressed this behavior in his letter to the Jews in Rome. They had the esteemed ethnic background of being God’s chosen people and had followed the law of Moses. Therefore, they thought they must be better than the Gentiles. They thought that God was only for them.\nBut Paul levels them. He slashes their idols and brings them down from their ego trips, telling them, “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). ALL, meaning nobody is excluded from the status of “sinner.” It doesn’t matter if you grew up in a Christian home, led a small group, or donated half your income to the church. You and I and everyone else are equal in this; none of us can measure up to the glory of God. In fact, even on our best day, we don’t come close.\nThis would be such bad news, knowing that we don’t make the cut for the “righteous” category, if not for Jesus. Because once we realize how far outside God’s holiness we land, we can understand what an extravagant gift God’s grace is. And that is why we celebrate His birth each year.\nGod doesn’t look the other way on our sin because we do enough of the right things. No, “the righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe” (Romans 3:22). This is the only way. Just like the Jews in Rome, we must admit that we deserve to be in the “guilty” category and place our hope for salvation on the work of Jesus, not ourselves. We can rejoice in the promise that God lavishly covers the guilt of all who believe with the righteousness only He can attain.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nEditor’s Note: This devotional has been edited from an earlier version.\nThe first time I went to China, I was caught off guard by the differences in the grocery stores I visited. The meat and seafood are exposed, and the smells of fresh meat were foreign to me. I’m used to shopping for meat in the refrigerated section of an American grocery store, where I’m able to forget for a moment the uncomfortable truth that this shrink-wrapped meat used to be alive.\nThe Bible is full of uncomfortable truth. God taught the Israelites, His chosen people, that in order to draw close to Him, blood must be shed. I don’t know why. Blood is a gift to us from our Creator; it courses through our veins, delivers oxygen to our organs, keeping us alive. Blood is a sign of life, but when it is spilled, it is a sign of death. Blood is a physical symbol of a spiritual reality. And yet, in Isaiah 1:11 God exclaims, “I have had enough of burnt offerings.” What is this? Did He change the rules? God taught His people that sacrifices were needed to bridge the gap, but even those sacrifices fell short. Our best efforts—even our efforts to follow God—fall short.\nSo what are we to do? God gave us the prescription for peace: bloodshed. And yet, even those sacrifices became a stench as potent as death in His nostrils. To cover my sin once and for always, I needed a better sacrifice, a perfect one. A more innocent source of blood. A truly spotless Lamb.\nThe truth is uncomfortable. For me to have peace, Jesus had to endure pain. For me to find solace with God, Jesus had to suffer alone. For me to be in heaven, Jesus had to die. The Lord was pleased to do this (Isaiah 53:10). It doesn’t mean that God is blood-thirsty and cruel. It means that He loves me so much that His own suffering pales in comparison with the joy that He takes in being near to me. Rather than allowing me to fester in my insufficient, futile sacrifices or wallow in dead works, He came down from heaven and made one last, final sacrifice. He spilled the source of life in order to drown my death. He bore my sickness, so that I might be healed. \nI am grateful that I live on this side of the cross. Because of Jesus, my life is relatively bloodless. There are no more bloody sacrifices to make on my behalf or yours in order to atone for our sin. But let us never forget that Christ’s blood is what purchased this freedom from death. God had a plan all along, one that placed the ultimate suffering on His own shoulders, and the ultimate peace on mine. Amen. \n\nClaire Gibson is a writer whose work has been featured in publications including The Washington Post and Entrepreneur Magazine, among many others.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Maria Furlough\n\nDon’t you wish, just once, you could go back to the way you felt on Christmas mornings growing up? When I was little, every Christmas morning was joyously the same. In our house, we would wake up to Raffi Christmas music, belt out NSYNC in the car ride over to Nana’s, and then our entrance music would play: “We Need a Little Christmas” by Johnny Mathis. If you’ve never heard it, look it up. It’s quite the jolly song—the melody, anyway. But the message of the lyrics? Well, here are some highlights:\nHaul out the holly;Put up the tree before my spirit falls again. …  For I’ve grown a little leaner, Grown a little colder, Grown a little sadder, Grown a little older. …  And we need a little snappy “Happy ever after,” Need a little Christmas now. Need a little Christmas now.\nPretty somber, right? The lyrics confess that life can leave us tired and weary, jaded and depressed. We can become worn down and worn out, and we just “need a little Christmas”—and we need it now. \nThis sense of urgency for peace has been present in all of human history. Finally, at Christmas, our souls can rejoice in victory. \n“Shout in triumph, Daughter Jerusalem!  Look, your King is coming to you…  and he will proclaim peace to the nations” (Zechariah 9:9–10).\nAt Christmastime, we are not just celebrating the birth of a baby; we’re celebrating the birth of a King! And our King has come to fight for us: “The LORD of Armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold!” (Psalm 46:11). When these passages were written, Israel was constantly in turmoil. They were either in captivity, on their way to captivity, or just coming out of captivity, and they looked to God to send the one true King to rescue them and finally put an end to their suffering.\nIn our culture today, at least in this part of the western world, we are not facing potentially fatal risks daily. This is an enormous blessing, but it also makes it so much easier for us to ignore our inner turmoil, to lull ourselves into a contented numbness. But when Christmas time hits each year, it’s like holding up an internal mirror, reminding our souls that we are celebrating more than twinkling lights and gifts to the tune of jolly melodies. \nThis Christmas, may we embrace the knowledge that we need still need rescuing; every inch of this world needs the lasting peace that only the Prince of Peace can bring. No matter what is going on around us, may we accept the peace of Christ with a childlike faith, and remember Christ’s salvation anew, joyful over God’s flesh-and-blood plan for our eternal redemption and salvation. May our homes and our families hold this verse in high regard all throughout the Christmas season: “Though all the peoples each walk in the name of their gods, we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever” (Micah 4:5).\n\n",

Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nWhen we were first married, my husband and I started saying something to each other: “When this season is over, life will calm down.”\nWe’ve been married a decade now, and these days we start to say it and then laugh. Life is relentless. If it’s not one thing, it’s another, and there are days when darkness presses in all around us until we find it hard to breathe. This season has been particularly heavy, sharing the burden of brokenness that has landed at the feet of some of our dearest people. \nWe’re really, really tired. We are, to borrow from Psalm 126, “those who sow in tears” (v.5). Each day when I drive the same Tennessee backroads to work, when the last vestiges of fog linger hazily over the trees like steam over a cup of coffee, I sing the same hymn based on Psalm 126: \nAlthough we are weepingLord, help us keep sowing The seeds of Your KingdomFor the day You will reap themYour sheaves we will carryLord, please do not tarryAll those who sow weeping will go out with songs of joy\nWhen I read Isaiah 9 again, one of the most familiar Christmas passages, I realized it felt different this year. It felt more like reading Psalm 126, like a psalm of ascent. It reminded me of the tired hope of a people who saw the Lord conquer once, in Midian, and knew He could do it again. Not only did they know He could do it again, but they believed He would. As I read, my mind didn’t linger on verses 6 and 7, which describe Jesus’s perfectly just and righteous character. This time, I kept tracing over and over the words in verses 3 and 4: \nYou have enlarged the nation and increased its joy.  The people have rejoiced before you…  For you have shattered their oppressive yoke and the rod on their shoulders, the staff of their oppressor, just as you did on the day of Midian.\nI was struck by the military symbolism in Isaiah 9, words like “shattered” and “trampling boot of battle,” the “bloodied garments of war,” and God’s name in the passage, “the LORD of Armies.” In using a very specific illustration of how the Lord conquered the Midianites by the hand of Gideon, Isaiah was reminding the people that God could and would bring light into the darkness—even when the darkness felt as undefeatable as a much larger Midianite army. \nI kept returning to words that hearkened a calling back, a restoration: “a light has dawned” and “as they rejoice when dividing spoils.” Then I flipped to Isaiah 60, and read once again of God rescuing His people from oppression, resulting in the restoration of many:\nNations will come to your light, and kings to your shining brightness…  they all gather and come to you; your sons will come from far away. (vv. 3–4).\nAs I circle each one of those phrases, drawn to them again and again, I’m reminded that Advent is a time of joy, but also of deep, heartfelt longing for restoration and for victory against oppressive darkness. Sometimes, Christmas feels like pure delight: Our good and righteous and just King has come! Hallelujah! Christ is truly with us. And while that is still very true, another reality is that this year, I feel like we are traveling uphill, up a long ascent, toward the promise. The light is dawning, but it still feels so far away. I need to read, and re-read even the familiar passages like Isaiah 6, to be reminded of a God who conquers the darkness and restores His people through the birth, life, death, and resurrection of His Son. May He help us to keep sowing until, one day, we will go out of this present darkness with joy into a city whose only light is Him (Revelation 22:5). \n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nMy family didn’t go to church much in my younger years, but I had a set of little Bible story records that I listened to in my bedroom on my yellow plastic record player. (Incredible technology, I know.) I listened to those records over and over again, mesmerized by the characters and stories. \nI was especially intrigued by John the Baptist. Who wouldn’t be? The longed for, yet totally unexpected, son of an aging and barren couple, the priest Zechariah, and his wife, Elizabeth (Luke 1:5–17), John was a miracle baby, whose life was the fulfillment of prophecy (Malachi 4:5–6; Matthew 11:13–14). He grew to be a rather strange guy, living and preaching in the wilderness, wearing camel-hair clothes, and eating locusts and honey. I’ll never forget the wild voice crying out from my record player, “Repent! Repent! The kingdom of heaven is near!” Interestingly, I wasn’t afraid of his peculiar message—I was drawn to it.\nJohn’s message was an urgent wake-up call; the long-awaited Messiah, the promised deliverer of the Jewish people, would be coming soon. There would be judgment, but also redemption. And before any of that, there must be repentance.\nHis message to the people was powerfully clear and simple. God would be sending the Messiah to them now. But they were corrupt, sinful, dirty, having not kept the commands of God. They had not been faithful to Him, and they needed to be cleaned of their transgressions. And so John offered an invitation to come, and get washed in the water. “John came baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism for the forgiveness of sins” (Mark 1:4). He was preparing the people, urging them to see their sin problem, to see their desperate need for a Savior, for Jesus.\nAfter all, what good is a Savior to someone who doesn’t know they are perishing? If I don’t know I’m dirty, I don’t crave a bath. If I don’t know when I’m sick, I don’t search for a doctor. And, if I don’t know I’m dead in my sin, I won’t hope to arise by the power of God to make me alive with Christ.\nWhen John cried out, “Repent! Repent!” it was a call to the people intrigued by a desert preacher, and it’s a call to us today to be honest about our sin-sick souls. Ultimately, it’s a call to run to Jesus, who would come to baptize with more than water—He would come to baptize us “with the Holy Spirit” (v.8). \nRight now—in a moment of quiet at home, or in my car surrounded by the hum of traffic, or alone at my desk at work—I can answer this call to repent. It’s an invitation to exhale and honestly, humbly agree with God that I am not faithful to Him either. None of us are, in our strength. Like John the Baptist’s listeners, we do not follow God’s ways and instead devote ourselves to our attempts at being in control of our own little kingdoms. John prepared the way for Jesus because the kingdom of heaven put on flesh to come near to us. He is the one who washes away the dirt and decay of our sin, and makes us clean.\n\nPatti Sauls lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband Scott and daughters, Abby and Ellie, where they serve alongside the people of Christ Presbyterian Church.

During my first pregnancy, I loved my prenatal appointments because listening to my daughter’s heartbeat was the best sound I could ever imagine. So when I went in for my first visit with a new pregnancy, my heart was filled with anticipation. Would I hear that delicate rhythm of a tiny heartbeat again? After a long pause, my doctor gently told me there was no heartbeat. The silence was overwhelming. \nThe next time I went into that same office, I was pregnant for the third time, but my heart was so fragile, holding out hope felt like more than I could bear. The risk of believing that something good could happen that day felt so dangerous. \nTo Zechariah, the angel’s message was too good to be true. The hope of joy was too painful to let in. What Zechariah knew of God’s character, even as a priest, was not enough to convince him. Are we not tempted, like Zechariah, to reason whether God’s promises line up more with His character or our circumstances?\nIf God’s promise depends on His faithfulness alone, then Zechariah and Elizabeth are ushered into a dangerous hope and joy beyond their imagination. What is the difference between believing that God’s promise depends on us or on Him? The temptation of crippling fear or the thrill of hope, in the face of uncertainty. \nThrough the angel’s pronouncement of Zechariah’s muteness, God showed His mighty power at work in both him and Elizabeth. God offered him this gift of awe to ponder within. Our doubt cannot stop God from being good to us and will not thwart His perfect plans (Deuteronomy 32:4). That is the kind of God He is.\nEven John the Baptist wondered if Jesus was “the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?” (Luke 7:19). Jesus honored his question, reminding him to look at the fulfilled prophecies which pointed him to God’s character, rather than focusing on his circumstances, to determine the truth.\nBy contrast, Elizabeth received God’s gift with overflowing gratitude, declaring, “The Lord has done this for me” (Luke 1:25). She let the mystery of God’s message draw her deeper into trusting His character. “He gives the childless woman a household, making her the joyful mother of children” (Psalm 113:9). That is the kind of God He is.\nThis season, there may be days when we are like Elizabeth in our awareness of God’s favor. Other times we may doubt as Zechariah did, too overwhelmed by our circumstances to believe God’s promises. Nonetheless, our gracious God ultimately delivered joy to them both, and offers the same gift to us now: Jesus Christ, our Savior. In our silence and waiting, God is birthing eternal joy in us. That is the kind of God He is.\n\nBrooke Kocher is a wife and mother of three. She is a Southern girl at heart and a recent transplant to the Pacific Northwest. \n",

Love consists in this: not that we loved God,  but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 4:9–10).\nJesus came to save us. I don’t know about you, but I need to stop today and set aside all the less-than-a-week-before-Christmas-to-do lists, and hear that again: Because God loves us, He sent Jesus to save us. Praise God from whom all blessings flow, from whom this miracle came—the miracle of Jesus’s birth, the virgin birth of the Son of God who took on flesh to save us.\nAs I slow down and step into these well-known stories, I am once again amazed by God’s pursuant love for us. In today’s passages, both Mary and Joseph hear about Jesus for the first time. The angel Gabriel tells Mary, “You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus” (Luke 1:31). There’s so much wrapped up in that one verse. Though she’d never been with a man, she would give birth to a Son and name Him Jesus. Mary would conceive and give birth in a way no other woman had or has since.\nJesus, the one whose name “is above every name,” and one day, “at the name of Jesus every knee will bow—in heaven and on earth and under the earth—and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father” (Philippians 2:9–11).\nJesus, part of the triune, all-transcendent, all-powerful, almighty God, who holds all creation together in His perfection, and whose power and glory and creative genius no words can grasp (Colossians 1:15–20).\nJesus, who came into the womb of a young girl to take on flesh and dwell among us, to save us before we knew we needed saving. Joseph was instructed “to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins” (Matthew 1:21). \nJesus has come and will come again: Jesus came to save us, once for all, by His work on the cross (Hebrews 10:10). By His Spirit, “the Lord is near” (Philippians 4:5), and He will one day come again on the clouds to wipe away every tear and make all things new (Revelation 21:4). \nJesus is here, among us. He sees the brokenness of our hearts and of our world and walks through it all with us. He chose to come and live among us because He loves us. Even in our sin and filth and grime, He loved and pursued and saved us for the joy set before Him (Hebrews 12:2). Let us praise Him, Immanuel, “God is with us” (Matthew 1:23).\n\nKimberly Girard is a well-loved child of God, wife of an extraordinary man, mother of three amazing kids, and writer living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nWhen I was sixteen, I was interested in finding romance. So naturally, I memorized the book of Matthew. Our church competed in teen Bible quizzing, and I thought it would help me to get a boyfriend if I was the best at Bible-quizzing. I wanted to impress a particular boy, and also triumph over him in competition. (Is this not what the teenage boys are looking for?) I had this whole genealogy eagerly memorized, so if I was ever asked, “Who was the father of Nahshon?”, I could be ready to gorgeously shout out, “Amminadab!” Believe it or not, this wasn’t enormously successful with the gentlemen callers. However, I accidentally fell in love with Matthew’s Gospel.\nEvery name in the genealogy feels important and special to me because I took the time to memorize it. The connection between each father and son mattered desperately to me at the time. It taught me to appreciate the tangle of genealogies like the tangle of my own human relationships—and why they matter.\nThe first biblical genealogy is in Genesis 4, featuring both murderers and musicians, and after that the Bible is filled with these capsule stories of families. Genealogies have all kinds of people—probably like your own family tree—and one of the things we learn from these lists is that God cares about people. He cares about all of our hilarious, adorable, smelly, embarrassing, ridiculous families. He cares about our details and our individual stories. \nLook at Matthew’s genealogy for Christ, rounded out with: “… and Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus who is called the Christ” (Matthew 1:16). His genealogy is divided into three sections: Abraham to David, David to the Babylonian exile, and from the exile to Christ. Already, it’s more manageable because we can look at the family line of Christ in terms of God’s work in three movements. He is established as: the son of Abraham—the son of the promised covenant; the son of David—the son of the king; and finally, He is the promise to a people living in darkness. God is showing us how He keeps His promises. \nWith a couple of special cases, the example of language courses has. as of not long ago, been extremely near the conventional kind depicted above, with a prevalent accentuation on interpretation and the composed language. Expanding use has been made of the language research center and recordings, albeit generally by the language associates. For certain years the last year Spanish division students have been shown starting translating abilities. The assessments likewise to a great extent mirror a genuinely traditional methodology, concentrating principally on interpretations, compositions and exposition writing. Disappointment with this model has been felt by some staff for some time and impromptu enhancements have been explored different avenues regarding. The framework schedules Extra resources which we have as of late drawn up and have had affirmed expand on what we see as existing great practices, just as making suggestions for developments. Most importantly. there is a craving to give lucidness over the School in all the language arrangement, any place conceivable by conceding to shared objectives and normal system. To this end, a rundown of the general targets which the student ought to accomplish before the finish of the degree course in the four primary semantic abilities was concurred. It is acknowledged that showing these abilities in discrete classes is incomprehensible and unwanted ~ however that, for the reasons for the general objectives, this is valuable.\nWhile the Creator of the world was redeeming our souls by sending His Son, He is also sending us the message that He cares deeply about people—collectively, yes, but also individually and one-at-a-time. He cares enough to include specific names of people. He is redeeming us not as nameless, faceless, wretched souls, but as the colorful and complicated people we are. He uses genealogies to tell us exactly who Jesus is and where He came from, including all the earthy details. And by telling us precisely who Jesus is, He reminds us that He cares about the details in our own lives. \nWhat great joy we have because Jesus is exactly who He says He is. As we gather this week, we can rejoice in a God who keeps His promises and cares for all the complicated, wonderful, regular folks in our stories too.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Erin Davis\n\nThe first Christmas I had a son of my own, the song “Mary Did You Know” unraveled me. I’d sung the words at plenty of Christmas services and always imagined Mary in sepia tones with a serene expression. But then I carried a child inside my very own body and delivered him into a terrifying world, just like Mary did, and suddenly I saw her differently. \nIt was jarring to look again at her story in Scripture and realize Mary did not know. \nThe angel Gabriel was brief in his description of how her life was about to change. So she knew she was going to have a baby, conceived by the Holy Spirit, who would be the Savior of mankind—the rest of the details were a little fuzzy. But when Mary arrived at her cousin Elizabeth’s house, the mood was celebratory. The babies were leaping, the mamas were squealing, and the occasion was one of great joy. \nMary didn’t yet know that her betrothed Joseph would make plans to leave her (Matthew 1:18). She couldn’t foresee that her child would one day go missing for three days (Luke 2:41–52). The angel didn’t tell Mary that her boy would be arrested and falsely accused of crimes against the state (John 18). It would’ve been impossible for her to imagine that the baby in her belly would be tortured, humiliated, and executed on a criminal’s cross while she stood by and watched, helpless (John 19:25). \nMary didn’t know any of that. But she did know the character of God. \nAfter the angel stopped speaking, and Elizabeth stopped gushing, Mary had an outburst of her own, the tone of which is so different from anything else we hear from her in Scripture, I’m convinced she was inspired by the Holy Spirit. Luke 1:46–55, known as the Magnificat (Latin for “magnify”), or “Mary’s Song,” is an utterance of praise. For verse after verse, line after line, Mary doesn’t focus on herself; instead she praises God for who He is: \nHe is the Mighty One.He has done great things.His name is holy.He is merciful.He has done mighty deeds.He has toppled the mightyHe has exalted the humble.He satisfies.He helps.He remembers. He keeps His promises.\nIt may sound cliché, but it’s certainly true: Mary did not know what the future held. But she knew who held the future together in His hands. Because her life was built on the bedrock truth of God’s character, she could lay down her “yes,” trusting God in moments of both supernatural joy and deep, human grief (John 19:25–27). \nMary’s story is not about us any more than Jesus’s arrival was about her, but I can’t help but want to be more like her. So many of God’s promises to me are crystal clear: He will finish the work He started in me (Philippians 1:6), He will return for His bride (Revelation 1:7), He will wipe away every tear from my eyes (Revelation 21:4). Still, there are other details about this life that remain “fuzzy,” so to speak. I don’t know what tomorrow holds or what brand of suffering waits round the bend. But I do know the character of God.\nHe is more than enough reason for my whole life to become an utterance of praise unto Him. This Advent season may our hearts overflow with a magnificat of our own, praising God for who He’s always been, and who He promises to always be. \n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nPregnancy is wonderful, but at times, it can also be fairly miserable, which is how I feel toward the end of my pregnancies. If you’ve ever found yourself in those shoes, then you know how uncomfortable it can be. Everything hurts, and it’s nearly impossible to bend over. As I grew, so did the wave of hormones, which made me want to withdraw from friends and family, to the point where my primary method of communication with many people became texts that utilized either “the rage face” emoji or gifs of very overweight cats. With my last pregnancy, I distinctly remember leaving my doctor’s office in tears, hysterical and frustrated because, at 38.5 weeks, I WAS STILL PREGNANT. I’d never felt more impatient, anxiously awaiting the sweet relief of birth—and, of course, meeting our new baby. \nAnd so, when I read about Elizabeth and Zechariah, and the birth of their son, I feel every wave of their words and emotions. I know my own anticipation must have been nothing compared to that of the barren Elizabeth and the mute Zechariah. I am humbled by their story. During pregnancy, I wrestled with my own selfishness every day, shame filling my anxious heart, because I knew there were so many who would give anything to be in my position. I imagine it’s a longing Elizabeth might’ve felt, too, in the years leading up to her own pregnancy and the birth of her son.\nAdvent is our waiting season. \nMaybe you’re waiting for a baby to be conceived or born, or for an older child to come home. Maybe you’re waiting for healing or love, for reconciliation or freedom. If we’re honest, we’re all waiting for something. And collectively, whether we know it or not, we’re waiting for Jesus to come again, longing for the wrongs of this world to be made right. We live an everyday Advent, waiting for the final, triumphant return of our King. \nZechariah sings the song of an Advent people. He sings of the Lord’s steadfast faithfulness, and he knows it to be true. He blesses the Lord, remembering the Old Testament covenants that had brought the Jews to this point, recounting the promises God made to Abraham, to David, and to His people. For centuries upon centuries, the people of God had waited for the Messiah. They knew what it was to wait. \nAfter the birth of his son, who would be known as John the Baptist, Zechariah prophesies over his baby with a prayer I’ve adapted for my own children: \n“And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins. Because of our God’s merciful compassion, the dawn from on high will visit us to shine on those who live in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace” (Luke 1:76–79).\nCould that be our cry, our prayer, and our calling too? Just as John the Baptist would prepare the way for the incarnate Christ, we ought to adopt his mission as our own, harkening to the day when our Jesus will come again, giving knowledge of His salvation to those who don’t yet know Him. In so doing, we await His return with purpose, spreading the good news of our precious Savior to all who will hear.\nElizabeth waited. The Jewish people waited. And we wait too. But we know our King is coming, just as we’re sure of the coming sunrise, to give light to those who sit in darkness, and to guide our feet in the way of peace. \n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nWe read these words every year on Christmas Day. We need to hear this good news year after year. Just like we trim the same trees and hang the same stockings, we keep the same traditions because we desperately need to be reminded of the source of our Christmas hope. On the importance of protecting our traditions, author Edith Schaeffer had this to say:\n“There is something about saying, ‘We always do this,’ which helps keep the years together. Time is such an elusive thing that if we keep on meaning to do something interesting, but never do it, year would follow year with no special thoughtfulness being expressed in making gifts, surprises, charming table settings, and familiar food. Tradition is a good gift intended to guard the best gifts.” \nWe observe traditions in order to safeguard our best gifts. We need the regular annual reminders or we would honestly forget. This repetition is a life-long liturgy—a return again and again to the vital truths of the gospel. When we read the Christmas story, it’s easy to think to ourselves, Oh yes, I’ve heard all this before. I know what it’s about. But when our feet hit the ground and practicality sets in, we forget. We forget that Christ came in actual history, breathing air, treading dust, sharing bread and wine with people just like us. \nWe forget that He came to our fallen world, a world full of inconvenience, discomfort, struggle, and tears. The pains and griefs that are often sharper during the holiday season are precisely the reason He came. They are a vital part of the Christmas story. We forget that we have received shocking news, and overwhelming good tidings. We forget the joy that has been given to this weary world, to our own hearts. We forget to treasure up all these things in our hearts. Instead, we heap up the treasures of this world, distraction after distraction, forgetting the untarnished, unfading treasure of Christ. We forget to rejoice.\nWe forget all the best things, even the true meaning of Christmas. And so, every year, we return to the same traditions, the same lights that remind us of the Light that shone from heaven, the Light of the world (John 8:12). The same food and drink remind us of the table of feasting that Jesus has spread before us (Luke 14:15–24). The same songs remind us of that first Christmas song that resounded in the skies that night (Luke 2:8–20). The same tradition of presenting gifts reminds us of the undeserved generosity of God (Hebrews 12:2).\nRemember on this day and rejoice. Christ has come! Unto us a Son is born! Today a Savior is born! (Luke 2:11). Because of Him we are no longer slaves, but sons and daughters—heirs to His throne (Galatians 4:7). Remember and rejoice greatly, O Daughters of Zion! (Zechariah 9:9).\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nDecember 26th is one of my favorite days of the year. Usually, the days leading up to Christmas include all the fanfare of baking cookies, opening presents, attending church, singing carols and hymns, and lighting Advent candles. And then the next day comes with an opportunity to enjoy it all again—this time just a little bit slower. It calls for flannel pajamas all day, making turkey sandwiches from Christmas dinner leftovers, playing with gifts, and eating up the rest of those cookies.\nThe events are over, but the lights are still twinkling. The traditions have been completed, but our hearts are filled with significance and satisfaction of our hope in Christ. Over the next few days, we will start to put away the decorations and throw away the gift wrap, but there are a few things we take with us into the new year—a refreshed sense of truth and celebration, and acknowledgement of the incomparable gift we have in Jesus. \nToday’s reading is a perfect reminder of this, as it brings us to one of the most important traditions Jesus completed. On the eighth day of His life, as was customary, He was circumcised and presented in the temple. There, two aging prophets, Simeon and Anna, saw the child in the temple and prophesied that He is the Messiah, and then went on to praise God for allowing them to see the Lord’s salvation in the flesh (Luke 2:25–38). \nIn the book of Genesis, God promises to make Abraham’s descendants into a great nation, formed from the womb of a barren woman (Gn 17:1–8,17–19). As a reminder of this miraculous origin story and a sign of the covenant God made with Abraham, every Jewish male was to bear the mark of circumcision. Jesus didn’t need to be circumcised as a reminder of the promise—He was the very fulfillment of the promise.\nEven from the very beginning, Jesus is identified with His parents, who were sinners, waiting on the fullness of that promise to come to fruition, and so they obeyed the requirements of the law: “When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were finished, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord” (Luke 2:22).\nWhile it would be easy for this story to be overshadowed by the pomp and circumstance of His birth and the days that followed, Jesus’s circumcision is one of the most profound reminders of who He has always been: both perfectly divine and human. We see so many displays of Christ’s innate humanity in this passage. He wasn’t born into a family that was holier than most. Mary and Joseph continue to surrender themselves and their Son in humble obedience, following the law and trusting God when they could not see their next right step.\nThe offering of turtledoves is also one of my favorite details of this passage. Traditionally, new parents made an offering after childbirth in order to purify the mother after having given birth; the substitution of two birds was allowed if the were not able to afford a lamb. Jesus wasn’t born into perfect circumstances or an extremely wealthy family, but that only put His innate perfection on display. He fulfilled the law and took our punishment, not because we have done enough to deserve it, but because He is enough.\nSo now that we’ve lit all the Advent candles and given all of our presents, we are reminded that the love of Jesus is a gift we get to keep all year long, for all time. He is perfect, He is human, and He is exactly what we need—yesterday, today, and always. Amen.\n\n",

But one of our favorite traditions that stuck—even better than the corn syrup—was beginning the season by listening to Steven Curtis Chapman’s 1995 version of “O Holy Night.” My mom has always connected to the more traditional songs of worship, so it makes sense that this hauntingly beautiful hymn is her favorite. The hymn writer coaxes us to “fall on our knees” while remembering the “night of our dear Savior’s birth.” Although the wise men came to worship Jesus some two years after His birth (Matthew 2:2,7,16), these lyrics mirror the conclusion of the Christmas story we find in the second chapter of Matthew. \nThe magi were overwhelmed with joy when they found the Christ child and discovered that their journey was not in vain (Matthew 2:10). Can you imagine the feeling? Without knowing exactly how far the magi journeyed before finding Jesus, we see that after entering the house, they fell on their knees. I imagine that after traveling so far, they would have been ready to collapse just about anywhere, but their first response was to fall to their knees in worship. After that moment of adoration, the magi “opened their treasures and presented [Jesus] with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh” (v.11). \nMaybe today we’ve lost a little of this reverence. When did we last feel compelled to worship simply from encountering Jesus, outside all the trappings? Personally, I know that sometimes the beauty of a piece of music or a landscape or a fulfilled dream can more commonly elicit awe than the presence of my Savior. What a tragic loss! He is the giver of all good things, and to mistake these things for anything more significant than God Himself robs us of encountering Him.\nEven if kneeling, falling prostrate, or another posture of worship doesn’t come naturally for us, let us stay open to the wonder of God’s presence this year. As the beloved hymn goes:\nA thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices O night divine, O night when Christ was born O night divine, O night, O night divine\nAs we celebrate the first Sunday of Christmastide, and the last day of our Advent study, may we continue to worship Christ with everything we have. What gifts can you lay before Him in worship? Even though, here at the close of 2019, we know how the Christmas story ends, I pray we still find ourselves awestruck and overwhelmed with joy, just like the magi. God be with you, friends, now and in the coming year.\n\n",

It is the music with which the bells of heaven ring; a song in a word; an ocean for comprehension, although a drop for brevity; a matchless oratorio in two syllables; a gathering up of the hallelujahs of eternity in five letters. “Jesus, I love Thy charming name, ‘Tis music to mine ear.” –Charles H.

Christmas, in my mind, has always been.\nThe image of stockings by the fireplace, the smell of a Frasier fir (fresh, never artificial), the mystery of an unnamed gift under the tree wrapped in Sunday comics and topped with a shiny, dollar store bow—these memories seem to exist outside of me. Unlike birthdays or first days of school, Christmas feels less like a date on calendars past and more like an already-set stage I wander onto each year. When the wind is coldest and the sky darkest, we’re invited to experience anew the warmth and light that’s existed all along.\n“In the beginning was the Word,” the Gospel of John begins, “and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning… In him was life, and that life was the light of men” (John 1:1–2, 4).\nJesus, the living Word of God, has always been (Colossians 1:17). But He has not always been here, with us. There was a time when the earth and everyone on it ached for the promised Savior. He would be the fulfilment of every promise, the incarnation of Almighty God, the kingdom of heaven walking the earth. Every human heart longed for His arrival—His Advent—whether or not they knew it by name. Even now, every heart aches for His return, for the Son of God to appear and make all things new.\nThe season of Advent is a time to anticipate and prepare for the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ—God here with us. This year we’ll read a mix of Old and New Testament texts, each day highlighting how Jesus did not come to establish a new religion, but, as our friend Russ Ramsey writes, “to fulfill the deepest needs and richest promises of an ancient one.” Jesus is the Spotless Lamb, sacrificed in our place. He is the Bread of Life, satisfying our deepest hunger. He is the Great High Priest, reconciling us to the Father. He is the Light of the World, which darkness cannot overcome. And those who follow Him will never walk in darkness because Immanuel has come, and He promises to come again.\nJoin us as we spend each day this Advent in the pages of Scripture, anticipating and celebrating the arrival of our Savior. O come, O come, Immanuel!\n\n \n",

It reached to the ceiling where it angled into a row of skylights and lit up the entire house. We loved it, but there was one single design flaw: the wall circled around a giant sprawling tree. It was an old oak with long, thick branches that stretched precariously over the glass. We would stare up through the windows at the limbs dangling over us, and we knew: it was only a matter of time.\nThen the storm came. We were in tornado country, and on a night when my phone was binging with weather alerts, a strong gust of wind hit the tree just right. A bough the width of my body fell squarely on top of the house and shattered several of the windows.\nSomehow, a handful of windows survived the initial impact, but they sustained severe damage as well. Cracks spread across the plates in an intricate web, compromising the integrity of each panel. The glass held its form, but it was irreparable. Ultimately, we would need something new.\nIn Genesis 3, Adam’s very first sin has the effect of taking a bat to the windshield of the universe. Creation doesn’t shatter from the blow—the form holds—but the cracks run far and wide. Every single thing that came after that moment are marred by a crack running through—every animal, every plant, every person. We are born into this brokenness, and that is the legacy of Adam.\nFor millennia, the world existed in this fractured state. With kings, with prophets, with sacrifices, with the law, we tried to repair and reverse the cracks. But the damage was just too great. We would need a New Creation, and a new Adam to exercise dominion over it. And so, the world waited for it.\nEnter Jesus, child of Bethlehem, born in a manger. A humble beginning for a man who would usher in a new creation. “For just as through one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous” (Romans 5:19).\nThis is what we anticipate during Advent, not just the coming Savior, but the great “making new” for which Creation has longed since the beginning of time. God’s plan has always been ambitious—not just a repair job, but total transformation—and it all began with the birth of His Son.\nThe question facing us today is this: who will we embrace as our spiritual ancestor—the first Adam or the second?\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nI’d been here before, or at least some version of this place, having travelled throughout Africa working for a missional nonprofit. This time I was in Goma, a city in eastern Congo, with its never-ending dirt roads. Surrounded by the realities of a war zone—refugee camps and chaos and orphans at every glance—I was deeply afraid. My heart had become trapped by the fear that I had finally found hell on earth, a place that truly felt God-forsaken.\nI was afraid I’d finally stumbled upon the one place the gospel could not penetrate. I feared it simply was not big enough for Goma; it could not possibly fix that amount of broken. But after the sun had set for the night, I took a moment to stop, to move my eyes from the chaos surrounding me, and to look up at the night sky, where countless stars shone brightly with the absence of light below.\nAbraham looked at those stars once, too. As he surveyed the realities of His circumstances, alone in a new land, he saw barrenness: an aging body and an aging wife, and no baby in sight. Yet Scripture tells us “he believed, hoping against hope… fully convinced that what God had promised, He was also able to do” (Romans 4:18,21).\nLong before God gave the Israelites the ten commandments—a metric by which we all fall short—He made His covenant with Abraham, promising the blessing and redemption of the whole world through the righteousness, death, and resurrection of the Messiah, Jesus. Long before the law would condemn mankind, God promised to redeem us (Galatians 3:10–18). Long before war and death, chaos and grief, hunger, disease and isolation, God had set His plan for redemption in motion.\nWhile Abraham never saw the face of Jesus here on earth, he did receive a glimmer of hope in his son Isaac’s first cry. By faith, Abraham received God’s promise, becoming “the father of many nations” (Romans 4:17). Because of Jesus, God now calls us His own—a holy nation and royal priesthood set apart to declare the goodness, power, and mercy of the one who called out us out of darkness and into His light (1 Peter 2:9–10).\nIn the four years since I stood in the volcanic-ash-filled streets of Goma, there have been many times when the light of day seems to reveal nothing but the harsh realities of our fallen world. But there have been just as many dark nights, too, when the starry skies remind me of the glorious plan I’m a part of. Like Abraham, I may not understand all the seemingly impossible circumstances through which God intends to display His power, but I do know that the hope of all the nations has come.\n\nRaised in Boulder, Colorado, Emily Blackledge’s education encouraged a love of all things international—travel, development, and culture.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nThe story of Abraham and Isaac is undoubtedly one of the hardest passages to read in Scripture. In Sunday school we sing about “Father Abraham” and his many sons, but we often sidestep this gruesome chapter. It’s uncomfortable and disturbing, bringing to light moral, ethical, and theological questions that have been debated for centuries. From Martin Luther, who praised Abraham’s “blind faith,” to Immanuel Kant, who concluded that God could not have actually asked Abraham to sacrifice his son—the list of scholars and theologians who have wrestled with this story and its meaning is long.\nIt is wise to approach Genesis 22 with a self-awareness of our finite understanding of God’s mysterious ways. We ought to approach it with a view of the whole of Scripture, seeing it as a single story that teaches us something about God but also as one that fits into the much larger narrative of the gospel, teaching us about sacrifice, substitution, and provision.\nWe can take heart in verse 1, which tells us that God set out to “test” Abraham. And Abraham rose to the occasion in faith; throughout the story, Abraham believes that God will provide (v.8).\nAbraham knew he could trust God, who had promised him land (Genesis 12:1–9), an heir despite his old age and his wife’s barrenness (ch.17), and offspring more numerous than the stars (ch.15). Abraham’s faith was not blind, but it was rooted in seeing God’s faithfulness to him. And so when God said to take Isaac and bind him for sacrifice—when it seemed that by following God’s instructions, God’s other promises would be void—Abraham acted in faith, saying “the LORD will provide” (22:8).\nAnd again, God was faithful to Abraham. He kept His original promises by sending a ram to die in Isaac’s place, allowing the lineage to continue. Abraham named the mountain they were on “The LORD Will Provide,” and Abraham lived the rest of his days in faith that God would continue to provide.\nLater in Scripture, in the book of Leviticus, when God demanded sacrifices from His people, they were not tests like Abraham’s. Rather, the Levitical sacrifices were for atonement—for the covering of sin. The Israelites made those sacrifices with animals, but they were always temporary. Year after year, on the day of atonement, priests would offer the substitutionary death of animals to cover the sins of the people (Leviticus 16). Finally, God sent one perfect, final substitute: Himself. “God sent his one and only Son into the world so that we might live through him” (1 John 4:9).\nWhen we pray “O come, perfect substitute,” we cry out with faith like Abraham’s, rooted in the steadfast faithfulness of our God through the ages. The God who provided a ram for Isaac, who provided a system of animal sacrifices for His people to draw near to Him, has provided a perfect sacrifice, once and for all, for everyone who would believe in His Son, Jesus.\nO come, perfect substitute, Jesus our King!\n\nMelanie Rainer is a bookworm from birth who makes her days writing, editing and reading in Nashville, where she also joyfully serves as the editor of Kids Read Truth.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nThe Bible is filled with something theologians call “typology.” I call it completely amazing. In the Old Testament we see the foreshadowing of Christ personified in Adam, Moses, David, and many others. These men who prefigured Christ teach us who He is and prepare us to recognize Christ when we see Him. The complexity and depth of the Bible in the midst of its perfect simplicity thrills my heart.\nWhile believers prior to Christ could see shadows of Him in prophets, priests, kings, and judges, we have the advantage of looking back on the fulfillment that the heroes of the Old Testament longed to see. Nehemiah rebuilt the wall, longing to know what we can easily read everyday. David trusted God, yearning to see the Messiah come. Moses led Israel out of Egypt but ached to see the fulfillment of God’s promises. He saw Israel delivered from the slave-houses of Egypt, but we have seen deliverance from the slave-house of sin and death. We have seen all these longings answered in the person of Christ; their deliverance foreshadowed our own deliverance.\nWhen He encountered Moses as the burning bush, God declared:\n“I have observed the misery of my people in Egypt, and have heard them crying out because of their oppressors. I know about their sufferings, and I have come down to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them from that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey” (Exodus 3:7–8).\nSo also, Christ came to deliver us; He has seen our misery, heard our cries, and known our sufferings. Therefore, “Jesus is considered worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder has more honor than the house” (Hebrews 3:3). In His greatest act of deliverance, He came down to rescue us from bondage, and now leads us to the land of promise. Christ Himself leads this exodus, and we follow after Him as His flock. He is the true Shepherd, who has set us free.\nTherefore, as we celebrate His coming, we lift our voices to Christ, our true Deliverer, echoing this antiphon, an ancient poem of the early church:\nO Lord, and leader of the House of Israel,\nwho appeared to Moses in the fire of the burning bush\nand gave him the law on Sinai:\nCome and redeem us with an outstretched arm.\nHe is worthy of all honor, glory, power, and dominion. This Christmas, as we celebrate Christ’s birth, we rejoice in the deliverance He has accomplished. We rejoice that the desire of the ages has been fulfilled and we have been set free.\n\n\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nOn Saturdays, Katherine bakes bread. Flour mingles with melted butter, sugar, salt, and eggs in a bowl. There is no yeast; no need for the dough to rise. She presses it out into an oval shape with a rolling pin and bakes it in the oven until it is golden brown on top. On Sundays, she takes the bread with her to church and it’s broken into pieces for communion. After the service, little children race to the altar to claim any leftover morsels for themselves.\nI love Katherine’s flatbread—not only because it tastes so good, but also because it brings Scripture to life for me. Every week, she creates something that is of such great value, children run for it. Do I run for Jesus with that much fervor? Am I as hungry for Him as they are for her delicious bread?\nMore than a thousand years before Jesus was born, God gave His people a recipe for their last meal in slavery. It was a quick meal—bread without leavening, fresh meat from a spotless lamb slaughtered and roasted in the same evening. He told them not to waste a single bite, but to plan to share with their neighbors, as necessary. The instructions were simple and clear: Eat fast and wear your running clothes. I’m about to deliver you to freedom.\nImagine the sound of the communal slaughter that night. Hundreds, if not thousands, of lambs all killed at twilight. How strange it must have been to paint that blood on the doorways—doorways that they would walk out of for the last time, just a few hours later.\nThere are countless parallels between events recorded in the Old Testament and the things Jesus accomplished in His short life on earth. The Passover started the Exodus, but it is also a picture of what was to come in Jesus. It is no coincidence that Jesus’s crucifixion happened during Passover. It is no coincidence that His blood is now our doorway into freedom. This isn’t a new story: it’s the same story that has been told over and over again, since the beginning of the world. For “He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was revealed in these last times for you” (1 Peter 1:20). What the Israelites started with the blood of lambs, Jesus finished with His own.\nAs we prepare our hearts to remember and celebrate Jesus’s birth, I’m brought back to the beauty of the Passover and that unleavened bread. In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul says boasting in our accomplishments is like adding yeast to a batch of dough (1 Corinthians 5:6–8). If I brag about what I’ve done, that attitude will permeate everything in my life. Like yeast, it will puff me up with air. But God doesn’t need me to be puffed up. He wants me as I truly am. And what I am is a person in need of a Savior.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Ellen Taylor\n\nWater is the cure for everything these days. Need to lose weight? Drink more water! Want your skin to stop breaking out constantly? Drink more water! Having trouble getting out of bed when your alarm goes off? Drink more water!\nThey say that you’re supposed to take half of your body weight (in pounds) and drink at least that many ounces of water every single day. This year, I’ve been trying to hold myself to that standard, even though coffee tends to be my main form of hydration during the work day. I have a water bottle that I keep at my desk and take to meetings, and I’ll try my hardest to drink a whole bottle of water for every cup of coffee I drink.\nI’d love to say that since putting an emphasis on drinking more water during the day, my life has completely changed—more energy, fewer breakouts, better sleep at night. While I haven’t necessarily noticed all of the benefits that people seem to claim, I have noticed how differently my body operates when I don’t drink enough water during the day. I get tired more easily, my head starts hurting in the afternoon, and my body craves water.\nWhen I read about the Israelites in the desert complaining about their lack of water, I have a hard time blaming them. Moses, rightfully so, got a little nervous when the Israelites started grumbling against him. He cried out to God, begging Him for counsel on what to do. And God showed up, providing water for the Israelites in the wilderness.\nIn John 4, Jesus meets a Samaritan woman at the well wanting the same thing the Israelites did—water. When Jesus tells the woman that He has something better than water to offer her, her interest is piqued. Jesus offers the woman living water, and promises her that her spirit will never thirst again.\nThe work of Jesus on the cross means that we are given access to the same water that Christ offered the Samaritan woman at the well. Because of His sacrifice, we are no longer spiritually thirsty; Christ offers us water through the Spirit that will cause us to never thirst again. This water is freely given to us, as Jesus explains:\n“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. The one who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, will have streams of living water flow from deep within him” (John 7:37–38).\nMay we be a people who crave the living water that Christ offers us. May we be a people who receive it. May we be a people who share the living water, freely given, so that those who believe may never thirst again. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

I can see him now, socked feet on wooden floors and chopsticks in hand, waiting for the ding! and pop! of the toaster, signaling that our cinnamon raisin bread, a favorite snack, was ready.\nMore often than not, and probably against the advice of any nutritionist, bread bookended our days: toaster waffles in the morning before school and cinnamon raisin bread late at night. That toasted bread—whether store-bought or handmade—symbolized routine, everyday life, a time when the days were busy and long, yet simple.\nHave you ever made bread of your own, kneading your hopes and hurts into dough that promises to rise? Because that’s what we all want, isn’t it? Assurance that all our hard work will force our dough to rise and take shape—that our own best efforts will bring us the reward of comfort, provision and sustenance.\nBut in life, that’s God’s job: to provide for His people. Yet after He’d brought the Israelites safely out of Egypt and generations of slavery, they’d forgotten His provision. As they wandered in the wilderness, they grumbled with hunger and doubt, angry with Moses, who’d helped lead them there. They needed to be reminded that it was God who had saved them and chosen them as His own people. He started by meeting their physical hunger, promising to “rain bread from heaven,” so they would “know that it was the LORD who brought [them] out of the land of Egypt” (Exodus 16:4,6).\nIn the Gospel of John, Jesus calls Himself “the bread of life” (John 6:35), drawing a connection to the manna the Israelites ate in the wilderness, and promising that those who turn to Him will never be hungry again. He tells the people Moses didn’t give the Israelites bread from heaven, but the Father gives “true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world” (vv.32–33).\nJesus came to us so we could begin to understand who He is and how, for those who trust Him, He promises eternal provision. He is always present with His people, familiar and constant and good. He provided manna for the Israelites to remind them that He is their daily sustainer; He’s ours too. We can depend on Him for nourishment and for our very lives.\nDuring this Advent season, when we anticipate the celebration marking the arrival of the Christ child, may we remember that God knew exactly what would satisfy our sin, so He sent Himself. He alone quenches our thirst and satisfies our hunger pangs, sustaining us through both ordinary and extraordinary days.\nO come, Christ, our Sustainer.\nO come, Jesus, our Bread of Life.\nO come, o come, Emmanuel.\nFor you have come, and will rise again.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nThroughout biblical history, there have been whispers of this beautiful truth: something greater is coming. From the creation of the world and everything in it, to the moment Adam and Eve disobeyed God’s command in the garden, destroying every perfect relationship that existed, we’re left longing for something more—for a resolution that can never be thwarted by human insufficiencies.\nThroughout Scripture we see the story of a covenant-making, covenant-keeping God and His people. We see in Exodus 34 that God vows to protect His people, bless them, and make them prosperous. All they had to do was obey the law He established for them. The covenant and the law existed because God had given Israel a special place as His holy people, a light to the other nations (Isaiah 49:6). They were to be God’s representatives to the world, holy because He is holy (1 Peter 1:15).\nAs mere humans, they couldn’t determine what was righteous or holy or good on their own, so God set up some precepts for them to follow. But try as they might, they could never manage to keep in step with the rhythm of righteousness God had initiated. Time and again, God’s people fell short of God’s standard and disobeyed. What’s intriguing is that the story never ends with their shortcomings. In fact, the story always continues with God re-establishing His commitment to His people.\nIn no uncertain terms, God’s makes His intentions toward His people, and to us by extension, absolutely clear in His new covenant. He promises, “I will put my teaching within them and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they shall be My people” (Jeremiah 31:33).\nThe Father sent His own Son to establish a more perfect covenant. Whereas the former covenant was sealed with the blood of calves, goats, and rams, the new covenant is sealed with the blood of Jesus. It was Jesus’s death on the cross that secured an eternal inheritance for countless sons and daughters, closing the gap between God and humanity, once and for all.\nThe same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead has given us a new birth. He sanctifies us, and His power joins us together as one functional and activated body, the Church. As the Church, we are God’s inheritance, holy and blameless, made righteous by the incredible working of the the Spirit’s power. And that same Spirit is the deposit pointing to the full consummation of the new covenant. Jesus Christ, our Righteous Mediator, will one day return for His beautiful, holy bride, the Church. Something greater is coming. Lord, hasten the day.\nErin Rose lives and works in vibrant Richmond, Virginia, where she serves as Worship & Teaching Pastor at East End Fellowship.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nThis past summer we hiked in bear country. With five children we didn’t give much thought to bears. Bears are smart and don’t want to be hassled, and a good amount of noise announces that hikers are near. Folks who aren’t blessed with five human noisemakers sometimes seek alternatives for the trail. Enter the adorable bear bell. It’s a sweet little jingle-bell tied to a hiker’s backpack that’s supposed to help keep bears away, and it has the added bonus of making the trail feel like Christmas. Our absolute favorite encounter was with a white-bearded man—a twinkle in his eye and a bell jingling at his belt.\nThe bear bell might just be a gimmick. But that constant jingle helps put one at ease. We think, At least I’m doing something to keep away danger! Regardless of your adorable ring-a-ding-ding, I imagine a grizzly would hold you in the same low esteem. Like the bear bell, so many of our attempts at solving problems and threats are insufficient.\nThe Day of Atonement was a reminder, long before Christ came, of the need for a sufficient sacrifice. It reminded Israel, not only of the price of sin, but of the surety of God’s provision. That day was to be a day of both complete rest and “self-denial,” and was established to be a permanent statute.\nWhen I think of self-denial, I tend to think of self-deprivation. But the self-denial to which we are called is chiefly about reliance upon God. It is turning from self-reliance, from self-sufficiency, from our bear-bell comforts and solutions, from our nifty quick fixes, and our own ingenuity, none of which are sufficient to save. When God calls us to self-denial, He also calls us to rest. We are to rest in Him, in His sufficiency, in His provision, in His atonement, in His salvation. He is our Great High Priest, and the Lamb who was slain. He has cleansed us once and for all time (Hebrews 10:10). It is a glorious gift to be called to self-denial, to complete rest in Him.\nLike tinkling bells before an angry bear, the regular sacrifice of bulls and rams was insufficient to deal with the problem of sin. But Christ answers our need fully so that we no longer need to live under priests who pass away, the continual slaying of animals, and the looming debt of sin. We have a real answer in Christ. The season of Advent is a time both to remember our desperate need and to remember the fulfillment of that need, which is found alone in Christ, the perfect Priest and Sacrifice.\nThe years of longing, and the long trail of inadequate burnt offerings, come to an end in Christ. In Him we find an offering that is sufficient once for all time, for every sin, to make atonement for us and sanctify us forever. We find our rest in Him.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nIn the book of Judges things really start to go wrong for God’s people. Or rather, it’s where God’s people really start to go wrong. Judges 2 is framed as a test—a test that the Israelites fail miserably. In a sense, this chapter sums up the story of the entire book of Judges. Perhaps it’s also the story of all of us, easily tempted away from God and enchanted by the glittery offerings of the world, of other gods.\nJoshua had faithfully led God’s people into Canaan, and at first, the Israelites remembered God’s steadfast love. “They had seen all the Lord’s great works he had done for Israel” (v.7). But then, distracted by the pagan gods of their new neighbors, they forgot God. They wandered with their hearts, after having wandered for decades in the desert.\nThe cycle of apostasy is a fancy theological term for what followed: the Israelites forgot God, and each time He sent a leader called a judge to remind them. But after the judge died, the Israelites went right back to worshipping the pagan gods of their neighbors.\nExodus 34 gives us the most accurate picture of God’s character, because God gives it Himself. He tells Moses that while He is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in faithful love, and forgiving of rebellion (vv.6–7), He’s also a jealous God, who wants our undivided devotion (v.13). God’s desire for HIs people’s affection is woven into His faithful love. God sent judge after judge, knowing all the while that His people would still fall away. Only one leader, only one judge, could turn His people’s hearts back to Him for good: Jesus.\nIt’s hard to read Judges without it feeling a little like I’m looking in a mirror. It’s not hard for me to remember seasons of my life when I drew closer to God’s heart and found in Him my all. But it is just as easy—maybe easier, if I’m honest—to remember seasons of the opposite, when I chased worldly fulfillment, idols, and false saviors.\nGod knew our hearts, broken by sin, would be prone to wander, and prone to wander they will be until His Kingdom comes in its fullness. We need not wander in the desert, though, following after imperfect and temporary leaders; we can follow Jesus. When we turn away from the lesser things of this world, and turn to Him, our faithful and final Judge, He promises to soften our hearts toward Him and His heavenly purposes. He welcomes us into relationship with Him and calls us His own (Ezekiel 11:19–20).\n\nMelanie Rainer is a bookworm from birth who makes her days writing, editing and reading in Nashville, where she also joyfully serves as the editor of Kids Read Truth.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nIt would be nice if every person we encountered were able to be perfect in some way. The perfect friend, the perfect spouse, the perfect leader. In fact, we often kid ourselves by being shocked or outraged when we witness the failings of others—as if any of us could ever live up to the impossible standard of perfection.\nTake David, for example. For years, the Israelites had been led by God, first out of Egypt, then in the wilderness and finally in the Promised Land. Yet after God had repeatedly provided for them in miraculous ways, they were unhappy. They looked to the left and right and saw that other nations had kings who led them into battle and who sat on thrones, calling the shots from their platforms. Restless for representation, they demanded a king.\nIsrael’s first king, Saul, was exactly what the people thought they wanted—strong and charming and accomplished by the world’s standards. But his heart was cold and distant from God. Next came David, who would be known as a man after God’s own heart (1 Samuel 13:14). He was faithful to God but still fallen and capable of messy, heartbreaking sin. David was a great king, but he was far from perfect. His shortcomings only pointed to Israel’s need for an eternal king—the ruler who would be perfect where other kings had been flawed.\nThe nation’s longing was answered in the angel’s proclamation to a wide-eyed young virgin named Mary. He told her, “You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David” (Luke 1:31–32). In Him, God has established His eternal kingdom, which will never end (v.33).\nIn the person of Jesus, God has given us the perfect King. Jesus lived the perfect, righteous life and died a sacrificial death in order to rescue us from the crushing weight of sin. He is precisely who He says He is, and while we do not deserve Him, He is exactly who we need. As we long for His return to this earth, may we celebrate His first coming during this season of Advent with gratitude, inviting Him to reign in our hearts.\nMelissa Zaldivar is a social in the world of academics and an academic in the world of socials.

When she was still a little girl, far too young to be planning a wedding, her daddy saw a wedding gown in a thrift store window and purchased it in anticipation of the day he would walk his daughter down the aisle. When that day finally came, there was nothing secondhand about Molly. She was a bride as stunning as they come, adorned in a gown that took our breath away.\nRevelation 19 sends us an invitation to a different kind of wedding reception, the marriage supper of the Lamb:\nThen I heard something like the voice of a vast multitude, like the sound of cascading waters, and like the rumbling of loud thunder, saying,\nHallelujah, because our Lord God, the Almighty,\nreigns!\nLet us be glad, rejoice, and give him glory,\nbecause the marriage of the Lamb has come,\nand his bride has prepared herself.\nShe was given fine linen to wear, bright and pure.\nFor the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints.\nThen he said to me, “Write: Blessed are those invited to the marriage feast of the Lamb!” (vv.6–8).\nThough nearly twenty years have passed, the memories of my own wedding day remain tender, as if they just happened yesterday. It was a beautiful start to a beautiful life. And yet, it was only a shadow of a higher truth, a more cosmic picture, an even more perfect union.\nMarriage is the ultimate object lesson. The covenant language we exchange at the altar tells a story, not just of a human bride and groom, but of THE Bridegroom, the lover of our souls, who has betrothed Himself to us in covenant love.\nLook again at the description of the marriage supper of the Lamb, and pay particular attention to the dress: “She was given fine linen to wear, bright and pure. For the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints” (v.8).\nOn the day when we, the Church, are finally united with Christ, our Faithful Bridegroom, we will be adorned more spectacularly than any bride has ever been, clothed in purity, and veiled in unfathomable grace. Our gown has been granted to us, bought and paid for by our Savior. We could never earn it, nor could we purchase it for ourselves. See how our wedding clothes are pure white, while Christ’s robe is “dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God” (v.13).\nHe came in swaddling clothes (Luke 2:12, ESV), so that He could purchase our wedding clothes; Jesus bought our wedding dress on the cross. But as He hung there, He just knew—the crucifixion was not the end of the story. He knew that someday, there would be a wedding, and His bride would be made ready by His sacrifice.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nIf there was ever a reluctant preacher, Jonah was it. Not only did the prophet ignore a direct order from God to preach to the city of Nineveh, but he also headed in the opposite direction. Now, I’m not sure how thoroughly he thought through this particular plan, but it did not end well for him. All his running earned him was a near-shipwreck and a three-day/three-night stay in the belly of a great fish. And then he still had to go preach to the city of Nineveh.\nThe outcome was incredible, though. In fact, the turning of the Ninevites’ hearts may be one of the greatest revivals ever recorded. Jonah preached a seven-word sermon (Jonah 3:4), and everyone in the city fasted and repented, even the livestock! The story is a remarkable display of God’s mercy and His desire to extend that mercy to those who did not know Him. The Ninevites were not God’s people. They were outsiders, but through their story, God demonstrated His steadfast intention to redeem all the nations of the world.\nIn Matthew 12, Jesus references this famed story when pressed by the religious elite to prove the legitimacy of His God-given authority. In turn, He rebukes those leaders, telling them they are slaves to the spirit of the age, members of an evil and adulterous generation (vv.38–39). When I read these verses, I feel the tension there and wonder, Shouldn’t these religious leaders, the ones who were most familiar with the promises and faithfulness of God, be able to recognize the Son of God standing before them? Imagine them there, demanding that the Son of God demonstrate His authority! It sounds preposterous, but in some ways, it’s a demand I make of Him on a daily basis.\nIn Jesus’s rebuke of the scribes and Pharisees lies the opportunity to turn their hearts back toward the truth. In reminding them of Nineveh’s repentance, Jesus assures them, “something greater than Jonah is here” (v.41). He was speaking the absolute truth! While Jonah’s story was marked by disobedience, Jesus’s entire earthly ministry was built on obedience and submission to the will of the Father. Jonah desired to see the Ninevites destroyed for their sin. In contrast, Jesus didn’t come to condemn the sinful in the world but, in the greatest act of compassion, lived and died to bring all to everlasting life (John 12:47).\nIt’s my prayer that my own heart would be soft and receptive to the work of God in the world today, especially in places where I don’t usually expect to see Him. I don’t want to be so fixated on the busyness of being a Christian that I miss opportunities to walk in repentance and extend mercy to others. As we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and anticipate His return, let us aspire to emulate the compassionate nature of our Savior—the perfect example of grace, mercy, and obedience.\n\nErin Rose lives and works in vibrant Richmond, Virginia, where she serves as Worship & Teaching Pastor at East End Fellowship.

I spit out the last word, face flushed and stomach clenched. It was a dumb thing to say, and I knew it the moment I started speaking. How I wished to be wiser, kinder, more like Jesus.\nSome days it seems harder than others to be the person I’d like to be. On the road of sanctification, the path toward Christlikeness can feel more like a labyrinth than a four-lane highway. Have you ever sat with someone who seemed to radiate the love of God, where every encounter with them transformed your heart and they exuded a sense of heavenly wisdom?\nAt the heart of these transformed people is the wisdom of God. It’s more than just knowledge about the Lord. Like Moses, their faces seems to shine; a different kind of glow emanates from them (Exodus 34:29–35). They inspire us to a higher way of living. They show us that it’s possible to live out of our true identity as the redeemed people of God, citizens of the kingdom of heaven, right here and now.\nFrom the beginning of time people have sought a source of wisdom. In the stars above and in pantheons of gods, civilization has searched for a guide. While men and women have long chased enlightenment, they’ve often looked for it in all the wrong places. Foolish gods, evil gods, weak gods—they just don’t measure up. Only the God of Abraham shows us perfect love, justice, and mercy.\nBut it’s not just ancient people who orient their lives by the wrong compass. Maybe we find ourselves putting more stock in the words of a morning talk show host than the words of the Bible. Or maybe we stop sharing our sorrows with God first and go straight to our friends for comfort. Of course, God can work through other people to speak to and comfort us, but we must discern if the counsel is coming from the well of everlasting life.\nOne incredible privilege as a follower of Jesus Christ is that we can have direct access to “all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Colossians 2:3). We ought not be swayed from the true source of wisdom, tempted to seek out relationships and paths promising an easier, more comfortable road. By the power of His Spirit, God is continually making us wiser, more compassionate—more like Him. And He makes us this promise: “You will seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart” (Jeremiah 29:13).\nIn this season of busyness and celebration, let us make room for Immanuel. Let us draw near to the Christ Jesus, the One who left heaven to be with us. He is the only wise God (Romans 16:27). Lord Jesus, open our eyes to see You, and bless our ears to hear from You.\n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nAlthough John the Baptist was Jesus’s second cousin and likely His friend from childhood on (he did gymnastics in utero when Jesus showed up, according to Luke 1:41), they were very different people. While Jesus grew up in Nazareth with a gaggle of brothers and sisters, John appears to have been an only child, and his elderly parents likely died while he was still young. As a grown man, Jesus conversed with rabbis and celebrated religious festivals, while John stayed out in the wilderness. By the time Jesus’s ministry had begun, John had taken to wearing animal skins, eating bugs and honey, and preaching fiery sermons that made audiences squirm. Yet this was the man God used to prepare the way for His Son’s arrival.\nRationally speaking, it would’ve made sense for Jesus to avoid John the Baptist. Hanging out with a smelly fanatic could definitely have harmed His reputation. But of course, our compassionate Savior did just the opposite. Not only did He slip off His sandals and wade into the muddy waters of the Jordan so that John could baptize Him (Matthew 3:13–14)—thereby endorsing His hairy hermit of a cousin’s ministry—but Jesus praised John immediately after His cousin publicly doubted Him:\nNow when John heard in prison what the Christ was doing, he sent a message through his disciples and asked him, “Are you the one who is to come, \nor should we expect someone else?” (Matthew 11:2–3).\nIn other words, “Are You really the Messiah? I mean, I thought You were supposed to come swinging a winnowing fork and spewing fire. But You’re out there spending time with drunks and prostitutes, and telling people to love their enemies” (definitely, my paraphrase).\nMost friendships would’ve been irreparably damaged by such blatant disregard. However, instead of condemning John, the Lamb of God gently propped up His dear friend’s flagging faith by reminding him that He was fulfilling Isaiah’s prophecies (vv.4–6). Then Jesus picked up a megaphone and bellowed a hearty “Johnny B” cheer:\nAs these men were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothes? See, those who wear soft clothes are in royal palaces. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written:\nSee, I am sending my messenger ahead of you;\nhe will prepare your way before you.\n“Truly I tell you, among those born of women no one greater than John the Baptist has appeared, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he” (vv.7–11).\nThis Advent season, may we not only be encouraged by the miraculous fact that Immanuel came but also that He stays. Even on our worst days, when our hearts fail and our faith wanes, Jesus is the one who sticks closer than a brother (Proverbs 18:24).\n\nLisa Harper is a master storyteller with a masters of Theological Studies from Covenant Seminary.

We gather our loved ones around the hearth, and wait for that special gift or the consummation of some nostalgic experience. We hope for our relationships to hum along in perfect Christmas-morning harmony. Every year I find myself shamelessly expecting ordinary humans to produce an absolutely magical tableau of Christmas dreams.\nEven though I live with these people and have found them to be deeply negligent when it comes to the matching of socks, I believe that the magic of Christmas will bless them with an ethereal grace. And to my annual dismay, on Christmas morning I am not transformed into a glittering treetop angel, magisterially heralding the good news. In spite of my best efforts, I am still my ordinary and absurd mix of the nonsensical and the severe, even with the smell of cloves and cinnamon in the air.\nOnce the presents are opened, the festive leftovers refrigerated, and the visitors kissed goodbye, do you find yourself filled? It’s easy to set our hopes on the details of Christmas that don’t ultimately satisfy. Gifts can certainly disappoint, food can go wrong, and visitors can occasionally bring more pain than merriment. Putting all my Christmas expectations on my children’s responses leaves me exhausted and frustrated.\nFor some of us, the unfulfilled wishes on Christmas morning come from a pain that will never fully recede, as the whole creation has been “groaning together,” awaiting our Savior’s return (Romans 8:22). And as we wait, we miss our beloved darlings who are far away, or those who have gone on before us. Missing them on this day, of all days, seems like an unfair pain to bear year after year. We wake up on Christmas as a needy people. Even if our bellies are filled and the presents are piled up, we do not find satisfaction here. There is something else we all desperately need that can only be found in Christ.\nWhen Christ came, He came to an empty and needy world. He came to a hungry people. When Mary heard the overwhelming news from the angel Gabriel, she declared: “He has satisfied the hungry with good things” (Luke 1:53). The first part of the gospel is this: We need. We need life and hope, joy and peace, food and drink, satisfaction and salvation.\nThe second part of the gospel is this: He satisfies. He knows our needs better than we do, and He is willing to satisfy. He is also able to satisfy. He loves us and gives us Himself, filling us up out of His abundance and meeting our every need. The hurting are comforted, the faces of the lonely lifted up.\nI want Christmas morning to be memorable and perfect. And it is, every year, because our joy and peace come from the good news of Christ’s birth. Whether your day includes sugarplums and arguments, or gingerbread and tears—just gather it all together and remember that Christ is our joy, and His people are a glorious mess of contradictions and sloppy kisses. Let people be human, and magnify God as God. Praise the greatness of the Lord, and rejoice in God our Savior! (Luke 1:46–47).\n\n \n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nThe ground must have felt unbearably cold, and the sky must have seemed a thousand shades darker. How do you go back to just herding sheep after that? \nBeing a sheep farmer myself, I can’t help but feel a kinship with the shepherds in the Christmas story. They were just doing their job, tending their sheep in a moonlit field, when an angel appeared to them and announced Christ’s birth (Luke 2:9–10). \nSuddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel, praising God and saying:\nGlory to God in the highest heaven,\nand peace on earth to people he favors! (vv.13–14).\nAfter what I imagine to be a supernatural concert, backlit by a cosmic light show, the shepherds raced into town to see the remarkable child. One minute they were staring at sheep, then a heavenly choir of angels, and then they were looking into the the tiny face of the Savior of mankind. Before Jesus’s newborn eyes had adjusted to see the sin-filled world He came to save, the shepherds got to gaze upon His wonderful face. \nBut then… \n“The shepherds returned” (v.20)—to their jobs and their junk, their homes and herds, and to their desperate need for a Savior. \nThe shepherds were bearers of wonder (v.18). Their role in the story of Christ’s arrival was simply to marvel at the miraculous thing He accomplished for us, and their awe is contagious. We join them in declaring, “Let’s go straight to Bethlehem and see what has happened, which the Lord has made known to us” (v.15). \nAnd yet… \nThe joy of this season fades far too quickly. Soon enough we will pack holiday decorations back into dusty boxes. We will go back to mundane tasks, and in contrast to the brightness of Christmas, the world will seem a little darker, a little colder. \nPerhaps declaring the wonder of Christmas is not the shepherds’ only job. They also show us how to carry on as we wait for the sky to light up again. For one day we “will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory” (Matthew 24:30). \nChrist will come again for us, this time not as a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes, but as a victor, clothed in royal robes of glory (Revelation 19:16). For now, we live in the in-between—the space between His sacrifice and His second-coming, His birth and the day when He will make “all things new” (Revelation 21:5). \nThe shepherds lit a spark that first Christmas. It’s a light that gets passed between us as we wait for Christ to come again. May we remain wonder-bearers, marveling at the miracle of Christ’s arrival, even in the darkness. And like those shepherds, may our hearts be filled with joy and thanksgiving, “glorifying and praising God for all [we have] heard and seen” (Luke 2:20).\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nMy dad loves to tell the story of how, when I was a little girl, he asked me to pick out a new figurine to accompany Mary, Joseph, and baby Jesus in my mom’s Christmas nativity scene. As the story goes, I overlooked the shepherds and wise men to choose a barnyard cat. It’s funny what happens when it’s up to flawed humans to prepare for the arrival of a perfect King.\nHowever, some people are quick to point out that the wise men don’t really belong in our nativity scenes anymore than my barnyard cat does. And Matthew indicates that they didn’t arrive until some two years after Jesus’s birth (see Matthew 2:16). He wasn’t a babe in a manger when they got to Bethlehem; He was a toddler. But these wise men from the east belong in our Christmas stories all the same, because Jesus came for the whole world.\nAfter arriving in Jerusalem, the wise men were sent by King Herod to inspect the Christ child. It’s difficult to pinpoint their exact occupations, but some theologians believe they were court magicians who served as priests, perhaps from Persia or Babylon. While we may not know exactly who these men were, it’s easy to assume they weren’t being sent by Herod to worship the boy. Herod’s plan was to kill the Christ child. He wanted the wise men to follow the star, find the young King in Bethlehem, and report back promptly so that he could carry out his plan. But that’s not what happened at all. In fact, quite the opposite occurred:\nWhen they saw the star, they were overwhelmed with joy. Entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and falling to their knees, they worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And being warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another route (Matthew 2:10–12).\nThey didn’t return to Herod. Theologian Matthew Henry calls this series of events “an early instance and presage of Christ’s victory over the devil” as the men, some of Jesus’s earliest devotees, became “wise men indeed when they set themselves to enquire after the Christ.”\nThis is what happens when imperfect people witness the divine nature of Christ. By His light, we are rerouted, never to be the same again. The Messiah in the manger was not the sort of king God’s people had expected. Nevertheless, He was the Father’s plan to change the course of humanity, and ultimately, rescue the hearts and souls of all who would believe in Him. May we do the same. May we turn to Jesus and worship Him with undivided hearts. May we follow the only God who is truly wise (Romans 16:27). Amen.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nDo you like to think the rules don’t apply to you? Oh man, I do. I mean, “recommended” serving sizes are just that, a recommendation, right? I make excuses for myself like, I’m old, so I can get away with it! or I’m still young, so this rule doesn’t apply to me! Or simply, I’ve earned this. I can think of a hundred reasons to skirt the rules because I want to redefine things on my own terms.\nWhen Jesus was born, He humbled Himself, yielding to the law that had been created to teach and guide sinful humans. He didn’t need to be trained by the law because He was the very giver of it. But submit He did. His parents had Him circumcised on the eighth day after His birth, just like all the other Jewish boys, to mark the covenant God had made with Abraham (Luke 2:21). Then, after forty days, they brought the new baby to the temple, all shined up and ready to be presented as their firstborn son. Neither of these rituals should have been necessary for Jesus; He was the God of Abraham, the One who had initiated the covenant to begin with. And He didn’t need to be presented at the temple, either. It was His temple, after all.\nThese laws existed for people far from God, to point them to Christ. But Jesus was not born with a sinful heart pulling Him away from the Father; He is the Christ. So why did Jesus and His parents submit to all these laws? Because Jesus was ready to put His neck under the yoke of the Old Testament law to “fulfill all righteousness” (Matthew 3:15), to graciously fulfill every letter of the law for our salvation.\nBy this submission, Jesus set aside the glories of His divine nature for a time in order to show us His gracious designs as a Mediator (Philippians 2:5–11; 1 Timothy 2:5–6). Because He was born under the law, He obeyed it. How much more should we, who cannot boast of divinity, submit to God’s law? How can we consider ourselves above God’s authority, when even Jesus submitted to the Father?\nIn quiet submission, He is honored, and in yielding, He is exalted. While here on earth, very few people were able to see Jesus for who He truly is: the Messiah and the Son of God. Both Simeon and Anna saw Him that day at the temple and rejoiced at seeing God’s plan for salvation in the flesh (Luke 2:30). Waiting decades for the coming Savior, they were given eyes to truly see Him because God keeps His law and His promises.\nJesus’s life of submission reveals the Almighty God. He humbled Himself and was obedient to the point of death (Philippians 2:8). Spotless and blameless, Jesus endured the ridicule of men who rejected God’s law. Perfectly righteous, Jesus descended to save the lawless—this is the gospel.\nLike Simeon and Anna, we ought to eagerly long for the day of salvation. And, like them, we are blessed to see this promise fulfilled in the person of Christ, who became one of us to redeem us. He is the Christ of Christmas and the Christ of our redemption. O Come, again, Immanuel!\n\n",

I don’t remember much about that day, but one moment has never ceased to haunt me.\nThe funeral had ended, and ladies in dresses and men in suits were gathered on the funeral home lawn. I was feeling especially proud of the proximity of our house to the event, and in my enthusiasm, I bolted across the street to change out of my too-lacey dress. \n“STOP!!!”\nHe shouted so loudly I was sure the whole town heard. And if they didn’t hear our pastor yelling, they heard the squealing brakes of the blue sedan that stopped just short enough that my tiny hands and torso came to rest on its hood. \nMy little life was saved, but all I remember feeling was monumental embarrassment. Every eye was on me, and I fought back tears because of my very public mistake. Everyone knows not to cross the street without looking both ways. It was Rule #1, I’d broken it, and the whole town saw it happen.\nThere are a myriad of differences between my story and the story of Eden, but the few similarities somehow help me understand what happened in the garden a bit more. The consequence of my action and their sin would rightly have been death, but all that concerned us was our shame. And the bigger headline of both of our stories is this: we were saved!\nSometimes when I think of the scene in the garden, I find my self focusing on the consequences. I think about how apparent Adam and Eve’s humanity became. They were naked and afraid and facing lives of painful labor because they broke Rule #1. \nBut God is good, and wise, and in the business of redemption. In Genesis we see that God disciplined them with both mercy and justice. He promised a plan for humanity’s newly-needed rescue (Genesis 3:15). He disciplined his children (vv.16-19). He covered their shame (v.21). And He sent them out of the garden (vv.23-24), where they would await the fulfillment of the first promise of redemption—the coming Messiah.\nToday is an important day. It is our chance to begin the Advent season with this very first recorded promise of a Savior. When we think of our sin, we’re often tempted to focus on our shame, or perhaps on our consequences. Today, as we walk out the consequences of participating in a fallen world, be reminded that the God who made us disciplines us because He loves us. He covers our shame. He saves us from death, giving us life instead (Ephesians 2:4-5). \nThese next four weeks are all about God’s justice and mercy and His plan to save the world through Jesus, His Son. We’ll read hints and promises and proofs of this plan of salvation in action, so that, when we arrive at Christmas Day, we might have a fuller view of the significance of Christ’s Advent. \nWe read as people living between two Advents—on the “He did” side of the first Advent of Jesus (celebrating what God has done), and on the “He will” side of Jesus’ second coming (celebrating what He is doing and will do). \nAs we read, may we remember: we’re reading our very own story of rescue.\n \n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Genesis 12:1-9, Genesis 21:1-7, Genesis 22:15-18, John 8:56-58\nGod is calling us to move from the land of our birth to the land of promise. For most of us, this is not necessarily a physical move, but a spiritual one. He is calling us to give up what we know in order to fully embrace the life of Christ. God’s invitation and promise to Abram in Genesis is one of the most expansive promises in Scripture. It’s basically a superfecta of every imaginable blessing:\n“I will bless you, I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, I will curse anyone who treats you with contempt, and all the peoples on earth will be blessed through you.”\n– Genesis 12:2-3\nWhy did God call Abram to leave Ur and move all the way to Canaan? Couldn’t He have blessed Abram in the place where he was already well established? Sure, God can bring His blessing anywhere, but Abram had to change. He needed to be able to give up his native soil, his dearest friends, even the succor of family, to follow God.\nGod called Abram to give up all the comforts of home because they were a temptation to return to his old way of life. The things that draw us back into our idolatrous habits aren’t worth giving up the promise of new life. God told Abram to run from these things. In the KJV it rings quite dramatically; God commands Abram to: “Get thee out of thy country”! He’s essentially saying to Abram, Run, with all your speed from the temptations that cling to you! Escape with your life, and don’t look behind you (Genesis 12:1, my paraphrase).\nWhat do we have to lose if we leave our sin and turn to God? He invites us to unspeakable blessing. The call given to Abram is like the gospel call that comes to us through Christ, the One who was before Abraham (John 8:58). We, too, are invited to leave our old life behind to step into the land of promise. Our natural affections must give way to divine affections. It’s in the Gospel of Luke that Jesus shockingly says, “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, and even his own life—he cannot be my disciple” (Luke 14:26). Matthew Henry explains it this way: \nOur country is dear to us, our kindred dearer, and our father’s house dearest of all; and yet they must all be hated, that is, we must love them less than Christ, hate them in comparison with him, and, whenever any of these come in competition with him, they must be postponed, and the preference given to the will and honour of the Lord Jesus.\nChristmas reminds us that we are called to do the hard work of willingly parting with things that are dear to us, for the sake of turning our affections toward Christ. We are called to hold our earthly possessions and passions loosely, freeing our feet to long for the ground of promise, and to walk away from the land of death. The Messiah Himself has come, and He brings blessing and life in His wake.\n\n \n",

Once to my parents. Once to my husband. Most recently, to some friends. I knew God was leading me in a particular direction, but the risk was big, the stakes were high, the likelihood of failure was strong. I didn’t think it was possible, so I wanted to be sure. I needed a sign.\nEven after being a Christian for a long time, it’s easy to reach this point in our faith journey where we desire a sign from God, perhaps even more than we desire Him. We want to trust in something concrete, clear, and undeniable. Something we can point to and believe that, “Yes, God is real, and I can trust Him with this.”\nWouldn’t faith be easier that way?\nThat’s what makes Isaiah 7 such an interesting story. In verses 10-14, King Ahaz of Judah is facing terrible odds. His enemies are strong and their armies are powerful. The fate of God’s people looks grim. And so, in a display of love and goodwill, God offers Ahaz a sign of His trustworthiness. Any sign Ahaz desires, God will do it.  \nHowever, rather than accept God’s generous offer, Ahaz does something startling: he rejects it. \nInstead, Ahaz quotes Scripture back to God, as if he is holier and more knowing: “I will not ask; I will not put the Lord to the test” (v.12). It’s a stunning moment of human pride, which Old Testament scholar John Goldingay explains this way: “The offer functions to expose Ahaz as a man who did not want to trust God even if he had the evidence.” \nGod nevertheless promises a sign to His people: a child born of a virgin, called Immanuel (v.14). The sign, in short, will be Jesus. \nThis story is a prophecy foretelling the birth of Christ, but it also challenges us with two truths. The first is to beware of our desire for a sign. Too often, our hearts are like Ahaz’s. We aren’t earnestly interested in trusting God more, but in trusting God less. Even if the sign would come, our circumstances would still be difficult. The odds would still be tall, the risk great, the darkness deep. Faith would still be required. A sign changes nothing about the situation, or God’s character; it only clarifies the source of our trust. If we need a sign to trust God, then we don’t trust God.\nThe second lesson this story teaches us is that a sign has already been provided. In Christ, we have the definitive sign of God’s faithfulness and love. Immanuel, “God with us,” is God’s proclamation to the universe that His intention is always redemption. Jesus is all the evidence we need that God is trustworthy and good. No additional sign could possibly supplement the bright, blazing promise of the Messiah come near. \nThat’s not to say God won’t provide occasional signs of discernment to guide us toward His will, but our faith cannot stand on these things. When it comes to trusting God with our families, our futures, and our lives, the sign has already been provided, once and for all, and His name is Jesus. \n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

Yet, when Christ was born, hope came alive! \nSince the fall of mankind, God had given promises that He would one day send a Redeemer to save His people from their sins. In Jesus, this promise came to fruition—what the world had been longing for finally came true! But the night of their waiting had been long. At times it must have seemed endless. \nLong before the nation of Israel had entered the Promised Land, Balaam proclaimed that a star would come from Jacob (Numbers 24:17). A star was a symbol of a powerful kingdom that was to come that would subdue its enemies. The Messiah would be the true star that came from Jacob, one who would subdue His enemies and bring everything subject under His rule. The “Morning Star” became a natural reminder of this promise when it appeared in the sky every morning. The planet Venus, also called the “Morning Star,” is the brightest star in the sky and appears in the east, serving as an indication that the night is coming to an end. It was a reminder that night—whether physical or metaphorical—does not last forever. \nIsaiah prophesied about the destruction that was to come to the kingdom of Judah. Indeed, in 586 BC, Judah was cut off—destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon—and viewed as a “stump.” But, Isaiah also prophesied that “a shoot will grow from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots will bear fruit” (Isaiah 11:1). Jesse was the father of King David, the one from whom Israel knew the Messiah would come. With this prophecy from Isaiah, God reaffirmed the promise He made to David that his line would endure forever (2 Samuel 7:16). This new line signified a new beginning, one free from the corruption of the later kings of Judah. \nLike the Morning Star, tree stumps provided hope for God’s people. When the stump of a healthy tree is left in the ground, it can produce new trees. Though the tree has been cut down, sprouts can appear around the stump and can grow into viable trees themselves. In the same way, the Israelites believed God would restore them through the Messiah. Even though they had been cut off, God could sprout lasting hope from a stump. \nJesus is the fulfillment of all God had promised to His people. In Revelation 22:16, Christ says, “I am the root and descendant of David, the bright morning star.” He is the One they’d waited for, the One they’d hoped for. \nHowever dark or long our night of waiting, we must remember the faithfulness of the Lord. All His promises are fulfilled in Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 1:20). We can get caught up in the thrill of hope, the excitement, the joy, because we are confident and secure in Him. When we hope and trust in Christ, we will not be disappointed (Romans 5:5).\n \n",

We are drawn to the bigger and the better: bigger gifts, bigger budgets, bigger light displays. And yet, since the very first Christmas, Christ has compelled us to look away from the “big stuff” that seems so significant. Quietly, He invites us to strain our eyes and bow our hearts to see the wonder of the small. But this invitation did not start with the tiny baby in the tiny manger. God was attentive to making sure every detail of His arrival was understated “from ancient days” (Micah 5:2). \nHere, in Micah 5, we find God’s people under attack and in distress (v.1). Any small glimmer of hope becomes momentous when our lives are under siege. We latch on to any news that better days are ahead when the day we’re in the midst of threatens to overtake us. So we can surely celebrate with the citizens of Zion because as enemies surrounded them, hope started to spark. \n“But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler of Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient of days” (v.2). \nLook around. If we hand-picked the details of the Christmas story, we’d prioritize grand above modest, spectacular above common, big above small. We’d likely dismiss Mary and Joseph as too unremarkable, the stable as too drab, and Bethlehem as too small and seemingly insignificant. Yet, as we trace God’s hand throughout all of Scripture, it’s clear God does not assign value according to our scale. \nThis fixation with the small stuff was as confusing to the people who encountered Jesus as it often is for us. In the Gospel of John, we find folks bickering over Micah’s prophecy (John 7:40-44). They knew the Messiah would come from the the hometown of David, but because mankind tends to have a collective obsession with bigger, shinier things, the point missed its mark in their hearts. \nBethlehem wasn’t chosen as the epicenter for redemption because David made it famous. It was chosen for its smallness. \nBethlehem was a small, sleepy town, handpicked by God to incubate a spark of hope until it burst into flames. In the same way, our own smallness points to the greatness of God. There is nothing we can do about our brokenness. Yet, like Bethlehem, our sin works like an epicenter for hope when we trade it in for the humongous grace God offers.\nWhen we exchange our obsession with making all things bigger and better, we are free to see that the promise delivered to God’s people through Micah is ours to hold on to this Christmas. \n“And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. And they shall dwell secure, for now he shall be great to the ends of the earth.”\n– Micah 5:4\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 20:1-17, Matthew 5:17-19, Romans 8:1-4\n“Are you an innie or an outie?”\nBelly buttons thrive in the economy of middle school locker rooms. As if zits and parents and slow dances weren’t enough to make our lives as dramatic as we thought they were, navels had to get involved. And although we’d lived with the same inward or outward belly button postures our whole preteen lives, suddenly, it mattered. We became expert navel-gazers, which is just as strange and gross as it sounds. I was (well, still am) an “innie,” but when we discovered that my friend Tiffany was the only “outie” in our class, her reign as 7th grade queen began. Who knew that was all it took to gain power?\n“Innies” and “outies” are created by the leftover scars of our umbilical cord—the one that once connected us to our mothers. The difference in their shape matters much less when we remember they all once served the same purpose—keeping us alive. We all need to be connected to something else to live. We cannot sustain ourselves.  \nBut all too often, we are quick to look down at our own flesh and see power instead of need, strength instead of weakness. And when we do that, it’s easy to think that all we need to become better is a nice set of rules. The law was a pretty great set of rules—the best around!—except, while it could keep us in line, it couldn’t keep us alive. Minister Matthew Henry described the law like this: “It could neither justify nor sanctify, neither free us from the guilt nor from the power of sin, having not the promises either of pardon or grace. The law made nothing perfect: It was weak.”\nThe law was weakened, not by the strength of our flesh but by the weight of its sin (Romans 8:3). We’re all born sinners, after all (Romans 5:12).\nBut one person wasn’t. One child was born into weak flesh to bear sin’s weight for the rest of us and do what the law could never do. Jesus Christ came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it (Matthew 5:17). He did not come to leave us in death, but to give us life.\nRegardless of whether we’re “innies” or “outies,” we are united to Christ by faith. When this happens, theologian John Stott said that “something so tremendous happens that the New Testament cannot find language adequate to describe it. It is a new birth, yes, but also a new creation, a resurrection, light out of darkness, and life from the dead. We were slaves, now we are sons. We were lost, now we have come home. We were condemned and under the wrath of God, now we have been justified and adopted into his family.”\nThe law of God we cannot keep. But the love of God is ours forever, without condemnation. May we live and breathe this truth today. Amen.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 3:21-28, John 1:1-5, John 1:14-18, Ephesians 1:7-10, Colossians 1:13-14\nWe have certain standards when it comes to building a fire. My husband likes to construct architectural log cabins from carefully chosen twigs, before solemnly striking his single match. I like to balance a cedar bark teepee and throw a spark in a tiny nest of dry grass in the middle. We also put a lot of value on the quantity of matches used. Zero is obviously the ideal number, and six is just sloppy recklessness.\nSince the weather has turned cold, we’ve been inspired to use our fire-building skills to burn out an old stump. Some people might hire a professionals to come out and grind, pull, or cut the stump down to the ground. Not us. We were determined to burn it.\nAt first, I lovingly carried a hot coal from another fire and set it down into the woody center. It created a perfect, simple fire, and I celebrated my cleverness and thrift. Three all-day fires later, the stump is shorter, blacker, and chastened, but it’s still not gone. I’ve also started kicking the stump. It was less fun for the fires to be about utility rather than art.\nYesterday I lit a fire at the stump using not a flint and a pile of magnesium shavings, but one of those shady fuel-soaked fire-starting sticks that will burn no matter who you are, regardless of your ideals, and in defiance of the wind direction. I held the object close to my leg as I walked past my husband, so he wouldn’t see, but I smiled because I’d found them in the house—and I know I’m not the one who bought them.\nWe can take pride in anything. The do-it-yourself mentality doesn’t begin or end with fire-building prowess. It runs through and through, and we’re always looking for a way to accomplish something boast-worthy. When we’ve got nothing to boast of, we’ll invent it, or take pride in the most mundane oddities. Have you ever driven a car full of seven-year-olds? They boast about who saw the truck first, and who has eaten their popsicle the fastest. We hardly know what a world without boasting is like.\nPaul writes: “Where then is boasting? It is excluded” (Romans 3:27). Indeed, we learn that God shows gracious “restraint,” passing over our sinful shortcomings, for the sake of Christ. Like little children, what we are and all we have is given freely, showered on us by One who has sacrificed Himself on our behalf.  He is both the art and the utility. “In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace that he richly poured out on us with all wisdom and understanding” (Ephesians 1:7-8).\nThere is no do-it-yourself version to salvation. The righteousness we receive is not native to us. It is “His righteousness,” given by His grace. We don’t achieve righteousness by some show of skill or cunning or willpower. It is given, heaped upon us and unmerited.\nWe don’t have to give up the good things that delight us: we are made to create and to strive for goodness. I, for one, will continue to both compete and hide from my husband when it comes to making wilderness-worthy fires. We can delight and boast in Christ’s righteousness, learning more and more each day to rejoice in His deeds and not our own because in Him is life, and that life is the light of men (John 1:4).\n\n",

The caverns would have been completely dark if it weren’t for dim lights that had been installed for tours like ours. We stopped at one particular spot where we could hear a rushing stream. Our guide told us that the fish living in that water had no eyes. That’s strange, I thought. And a little creepy. But then our guide explained: “Why grow eyes when you live only in darkness?”\nThey didn’t know any better. Their world was dark. There was no need to see. \nI think the only thing darker than darkness, is not knowing you’re in darkness. Stumbling around this earth unaware of the light that could be warming you, that could be lighting your way.\nBefore Jesus, this was the state of humanity. We were “the people who walked in darkness…who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death” (Isaiah 9:2). Yet we didn’t know. Sin was our normal. The path toward death was the only road we had walked.  \nIn darkness, we could not see our way. In darkness, things were unclear and unknown. In darkness, our sin was hidden. It was the ideal environment for fear, despair, and shame to thrive in. \nBut then came “the light of the world” (John 8:12). Jesus. He illuminated the path. He exposed our sin so that we could finally be healed. He made clear the world around us. He was hope in a world of growing fear and shame and despair. He gave us new eyes to see a new world, one that—unlike that of the poor fish in Mammoth Cave—was not dark, but full of light. \nI remember when the grace of Christ first touched my life. The world looked different. Everything appeared more colorful and radiant, as if I had only been able to see one hue of God’s creation and could now see it in a bolder, deeper color. I had a Savior who had died for my sin. I had been made righteous by His blood. There was absolutely nothing I could do to earn that righteousness, and there was nothing I could do to lose it. As my eyes were opened to this light, I was filled with a hope and joy and peace I had never experienced. \nBut the light of Christ doesn’t stop with us. As Isaiah prophesied to the Israelites in captivity, “Arise, shine; for your light has come! And the glory of the Lord is risen upon you” (Isaiah 60:1). When we shine with the glory of the Lord, others see a light that points them toward Him—and one day, all will see this light. \nThat’s something I love about Advent. It not only reminds of Jesus’ birth, but it gives us an opportunity to look forward to when He will come again. When the glory that shined on Israel—the same glory that shines on us—will illuminate everything forever. A place where there will be no night, no need for a lamp or even the light of the sun, “for the Lord God gives them light” (Revelation 22:5). Amen.\n \n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Isaiah 1:11,18, Isaiah 53:4-5, John 1:29, Hebrews 9:11-14, Hebrews 10:1-14\nI forgot the gospel again today. I forget it all the time. I have salvation amnesia, persistent forgetfulness, dementia of the gospel sort. It starts out like every other day, waking in the still dark morning, shuffling around the kitchen for coffee, disoriented until I have it. I try to read my Bible, try to look at my to-do list, try to will myself over to the broom and the mop. I am glassy-eyed, tired, and all I can see is my litany of morning failures—already and already I have forgotten the gospel. \nAs much as I know, theologically speaking, that Christ died for all the sins of the world (John 1:29), I still find myself spending the beginning and middle and end of every day, trying to save my own self from my own self. I’m convinced, constantly, that I am not enough or somehow too much, that I will never be worthy. A friend once said the way to stop sinning is to stop looking at your sin and look instead at the cross. But I am like Narcissus of old, enraptured by my own reflection—gross as it is. I cannot look away, and so, glutted on the insufficiency of myself, I forget the gospel. \nI don’t think I’m alone in this. I think many of us get caught up in our dead works: sacrifices and sin offerings with the hope of self-purifying our flesh; bargaining chips and weak promises; repeated attempts to confess but not truly repent or actually change. The prophet Isaiah’s words still stand for us today: God is unimpressed by our empty and useless offerings (Isaiah 1:11-18). Even more, He is disgusted by them. \nThe reason I think He is disgusted is because I think I am disgusting. I think my fear makes me putrid, my brokenness makes me weak, and my sin has stained me crimson. I am right about the latter; my sin is deep. But I am wrong about the former; God is not disgusted with me. And all my attempts to clean myself only prove I still don’t see Christ’s sacrifice as all-sufficient for all my brokenness and for all time. The Father has inserted the image of Christ between me and my reflection, yet I still try to look around Him, forgetting that He is there and that He is sufficient.\nIn one way or another, we all have various empty reflections we run back to, thinking, When God said this He must have meant that. We struggle to believe that when He said “once for all,” He really meant it: one sacrifice for all time and all people who would believe (Hebrews 10:1-14). \nWhat would it mean for you today, to believe your attempts at self-redemption are vain, meaningless, and empty? How might your day-to-day life change if you were to keep your eyes fixed on the cross, instead of on your sin and circumstances? As a child of God, what would it be like to truly believe that “the Lamb of God who has come to take away the sins of this world!” (John 1:29) also came to wash your sins away? \n“Come, let us settle this,”\nsays the LORD.\n“Though your sins are scarlet,\nthey will be as white as snow;\nthough they are crimson red,\nthey will be like wool.”\n– Isaiah 1:18\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Micah 4:1-7, Psalm 46:4-11, Isaiah 53:4-12\nIt was December 1914, and World War I was just beginning to shake the globe to its core. Both Allied and German forces had already dug and settled into their frozen trenches on the Western Front—their circumstances and surroundings were fraught with anything but “peace on earth” and “goodwill toward men.” \nYet, on Christmas Day, as the sun rose on the battlefield, hope rose with it. A few brave German soldiers crested the trenches they’d fought from hours earlier and crossed into enemy territory shouting Christmas greetings. In response, British and German soldiers met in “No Man’s Land.” They shook hands, sang Christmas carols, played soccer, and exchanged small gifts of comfort. An unofficial Christmas truce declared, weapons were temporarily laid down, symbolically traded in for goodwill and human dignity. As the sun set on Christmas night, soldiers retreated back to their trenches and the horrific fighting continued. It was a wonder not been repeated in any conflict since. \nThough WWI officially ended four years after that Christmas miracle, the battle wages on. Geopolitical conflict is a constant. Threats are never ending. Wars rage in our hearts, in our homes, and around the globe. Because of this, the words of the prophet Micah feel like a fairytale—sweet but out of reach: \nThey will beat their swords into plows\nand their spears into pruning knives.\nNation will not take up the sword against nation,\nand they will never again train for war.\nBut each person will sit under his grapevine\nand under his fig tree\nwith no one to frighten him.\n– Micah 4:3-4\nWhen those first soldiers started singing in 1914, the others must have thought it was a trick. They couldn’t fathom an end to the fighting, even for a single day. As we sit in the trenches, we feel the same jaded weariness. We cannot imagine an end to the suffering, the wars, the death, and the heartache. Yet, I am confident that as soldiers looked across the battlefield that Christmas, they didn’t want to see carnage. Neither do we. At least for a moment, we want to forget the war and consider all that is merry and bright. \nThese dueling mindsets—our hopelessness that the fighting will end and our longing to lay our weapons down all together—are reconciled through Christ. There is only joy for the world because of the war Jesus fought and won on our behalf. \nFor a moment, don’t look away. Don’t search for something warm and fuzzy. Listen closely. \nBut he was pierced because of our rebellion,\ncrushed because of our iniquities;\npunishment for our peace was on him,\nand we are healed by his wounds.\n– Isaiah 53:5\nAt the cross, Jesus entered the war to end all wars. His was not a quiet sit-in or a peaceful protest. It was a battle to the death. Like a soldier who goes to war for the good of his country, Jesus surrendered Himself, warred against sin, and won. \nThe ceasefire promised in Scripture is not a fairytale. It’s not a bedtime story incapable of granting us more than temporary comfort. The peace treaty has been signed in blood, secured by the Savior who arrived as a baby in a manger. This war will not rage forever. Because of Jesus, one day there will be no more enemy lines to cross.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

How many more days until Christmas?” \nIt was AUGUST.\nAs I dove into the text for today’s Advent reading, I was reminded of her childlike longing for Christmas to come. I know that as a kid it has a lot to do with getting presents, drinking hot chocolate, and eating Christmas cookies, but I believe there is something about that longing for Christmas that God has etched into our hearts. In our longings, big and small, we seem built for anticipation. And in the waiting, we can see how God wants His people to be prepared for their coming Rescuer. Through His prophet Malachi, the Lord promises to send one to lead them in their preparation:\n“See, I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,” says the Lord Almighty.\n– Malachi 3:1\nI love that God knew we would need someone to tell us to pay attention. And so He sent John the Baptist, whose message would bring comfort even as it called us to “prepare the way for the Lord in the wilderness’” (Isaiah 40:1). God knew our distracted and discontented hearts would need to hear a voice to cut through the chaos of this world—a herald pointing to the good news to come, saying, “Don’t miss this!”\nJohn’s story begins with two faithful parents, Zechariah and his wife Elizabeth. “They had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years” (Luke 1:7). Yet suddenly, one day while Zechariah is serving as a priest before God, an angel appears to him with this joyous message:\n“Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife, Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.”\n– Luke 1:13\nCan you imagine hearing this news? After being barren for the entirety of their marriage, a son is promised. Years of faithful service. Years of longing. Years of prayers for a child seemingly unanswered. And here, God promises a son, John, who will “make ready a people prepared for the Lord” (Luke 1:17). \nHow fitting it is that the messenger who is helping God’s people prepare to meet the Messiah was born after years and years of his own parents’ waiting, longing, and hoping. It reminds me that there is a Messiah for those who are suffering silently from all kinds of broken dreams, deep wounds, and unmet longings. It reminds me that Jesus is near to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), and our suffering in the wilderness isn’t the end of the story. \nDo you find yourself in the desert today, facing the wilderness? Are there places in your heart that need tending to, places the Lord wants to prepare the way for His healing? Advent is a season of anticipation, one that invites us to make room for Immanuel in our hearts. That may look like giving ourselves some margin to rest and soak in His Word. Or it may mean turning to Him in repentance, allowing Him to tenderly search our hearts and root out remnants of unforgiveness and fear and doubt. \nWhatever He’s calling us to, may we do it faithfully, so we can prepare even the hardest places in our lives to remember and be encouraged that the Lord we are seeking has indeed come. And may we be like expectant four-year-olds as we anticipate the celebration of the arrival of our Savior and Lord. \n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 1:18-25, Genesis 18:9-15, Luke 7:18-28, Romans 4:19-21\nMy kids have never believed in Santa Claus. It actually didn’t ever really cross my mind to drum up enthusiasm over presenting them with gifts that I’d paid for but were “from Santa.” I think part of this pragmatic position came from having so many little people all at once. I didn’t want to risk stirring them up into a frenzy about anything, because I was so keen on calming them back down for bedtime—even at Christmas.\nBut I think some of them still believed in Santa anyway, because I remember the quiet, hesitant questions they asked one night as we sat around the fire, drinking hot chocolate. “Mama, did you hear sleigh bells outside…?” one asked, in spite of my sober pragmatism. I think they still wished there were a jolly old man with a twinkle in his eye who would come bearing gifts for them. \nWe are made for belief. We are born with an innate sense of something greater than ourselves. As parents, we try to pair our children’s desire to believe with the truth of the gospel. But as adults, we still get confused about where to place our own belief.\nI guess Zechariah almost choked on the incense when he heard the angel’s message. “How can I know this?” he asked the angel. “For I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years” (Luke 1:18). The thing is, old people sometimes do have children—it’s rare, but it’s not that unbelievable. Plus, the message came from an angel, so you’d think Zechariah would have just believed it. But instead, the priest demands proof: “How can I know this?” He was literally in the temple praying when Gabriel came to him, yet he still wasn’t ready to believe.\nZechariah was silenced for his unbelief; the angel stopped his mouth from speaking even more unbelief. Zechariah asks for a sign, and the sign he gets is one of gentle rebuke. This is a great moment to admire God’s forbearance with us. When I object to His promises, when I am full of disbelief, He doesn’t strike me deaf and dumb right there on the spot. This is a mercy, because like Zechariah, I am keen for signs when I already have the answers.\nHowever, by not being able to speak or share the angel’s message with anyone, Zechariah was better able to think. Matthew Henry insightfully suggests that Zechariah’s inability to share the news symbolizes the deficiency of the Old Testament’s priesthood, as compared with Christ’s priesthood in the New Testament, when He communicates the truth of the gospel.\nThe Old Testament teaches us by signs and gestures, giving us some picture of our salvation that is to come. But it is imperfect, like trying to get news from a man who has to speak using only gestures. In the New Testament, Christ speaks the gospel to us with His own lips and gives us the good news with His own flesh and bones.\nWe were made for belief, yet we are quick to disbelieve the most profound and resounding declarations of God’s own voice. Sometimes we have to hush our doubting lips for our hearts to find fulfillment and rest in God’s Word. \nThanks be to Christ for being both the Author and Finisher of our faith.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 1:26-38, Matthew 1:18-25, Job 33:4 \nMy flight was canceled—for the seventh time that day. What I’d planned to be a refreshing girls trip, had quickly spun into a stress-filled travel debacle. I had set my heart on this trip, buying a ticket guaranteeing (or so I believed) my passage from Point A to Point B. But the weather and the airlines had different plans for me. I’m not going to lie; it’s hard for me to stay positive when my expectations start falling apart. And based on the mood in the airport that day, I’d guess most people don’t react well to unwanted change.\nA delayed vacation is such a little thing compared to, say, the unexpected pregnancy of a virgin. I used to think it was strange that Mary was afraid when the angel Gabriel appeared to her. He’s an angel, after all. Shouldn’t she be amazed or awestruck? While fear is hardly an uncommon reaction to encountering angels in the Bible (Matthew 1:19-25; Luke 2:8-20), Mary’s story leads me to believe that perhaps angels do not appear like the gentle white-clothed, feather-singed, harp-carrying creatures we’ve imagined them to be.\nNow try to imagine a young, teenage girl with a formidable creature appearing before her, saying that, while there is no logical or scientific reason she should be pregnant, indeed she is! This makes it seem quite natural for Mary to respond with fear and then disbelief. And so she asks the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?” (Luke 1:34). She’s basically saying, This cannot be happening—can it? Who hasn’t felt the same way at some point or another?\nWhat’s unique about Mary’s reaction is that she moves from fear of the angel, to disbelief of the situation, and then on to obedience to her God. I don’t know about you, but I tend to move from fear to disbelief to frustration to defeat—only landing on obedience after a long internal struggle. Mary doesn’t do that. She doesn’t tell God He will have to take her kicking and screaming into His will. Lo and behold, her betrothed Joseph follows suit—his heart moving from fear to disbelief and, ultimately, to obedience.\nI think the secret to Mary and Joseph’s faithful response lies in their true identity. It’s significant that after the angel Gabriel breaks the shocking news, Mary quickly identifies herself as “the servant of the Lord” (Luke 1:38). She could have objected to God’s will, aligning herself with other identities instead, arguing, “But I’m a virgin!” or “I’m un-wed!” or “I’m still young!” All of those things were true, but Mary’s truest identity came from her relationship with God.\nWhen we fight the will of God, aren’t we just prioritizing another identity over the one He’s given us? In our hearts, aren’t we quietly saying that we want to be lord over our own lives, rather than abiding with Him as His faithful servant? Thankfully, we can gladly choose the role of God’s servant because we know the Lord is a far better and more gracious ruler than we could ever be to ourselves.\nInstead of struggling against the good things God wants to do in and through our lives, let us imitate Mary’s reaction to a shocking and wild calling. Even better, let us emulate the obedience of Jesus Himself before His Father (Luke 22:41-42). Although fear and disbelief naturally arise, let us lean into the Lord’s calling with obedience. Only then will we find the peace that can only come from walking in relationship with the Most High.\n \nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 1:39-55, Genesis 25:21-26, John 4:24\nThree years ago, my parents and I made a different type of Christmas list—the kind you don’t want to check twice. Instead of brimming with names of books, games, or clothing we hoped to receive as gifts, the list contained a few very strict non-negotiables. You see, Christmas would be smaller this year, mostly because it would be sadder.\nIt was our first true holiday without the fourth limb of our family tree, my little brother, who had passed away a few months before. He’d loved Christmas tree decorating and gingerbread house making more than any of us, and we’d all decided to keep the ornaments and memories of past Christmases in their boxes this season. We still wanted to celebrate the holiday, but decided to do it in our own way, which brought us to our non-negotiables list. We sat quietly as my mom, dad, and I took turns listing parties and traditions we’d save for another year—those that felt too unbearably painful.\nMy bedroom faced my brother’s, and all I could imagine was waking up on Christmas morning only to remember he wasn’t there. Graciously respecting my non-negotiable, we rented a cozy cabin nearby to sleep in on Christmas Eve. The morning came and left without stockings or parades, and we drove home later that night. \nWe walked inside our barely-decorated home, and while I was ready to usher in the 26th with relief, I noticed my mother rustling around the kitchen drawers and cabinets. She emerged with a lighter, sand, and paper bags and headed toward the door. I looked outside to see my mother, grieved and without her son, lining the neighborhood streets with candlelit luminaries. \nWhile it’s never a guarantee that Christmas will be merry and bright, Christ’s birth lights our path to an eternal hope. Hope doesn’t just latch onto imperfect circumstances—it requires them. Mary was an unmarried virgin, yet she became pregnant. Elizabeth was of old age, yet she, too, became pregnant.\nNo matter how barren our lives feel, we, as God’s people, are expectant. The waiting season of Advent calls us to intensely believe not just in what has happened, but what is coming. \nA child will be born, unto us.\nHope will be born, unto us.\nJoy will be born, unto us.\nEternity will be born, unto us.\nThis passage depicting the interaction between these two women is one of my favorites, because I imagine them standing together, each with their own worries and questions, yet still beholding the same gleaming hope.\n“Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill what he has spoken to her!”\n– Luke 1:45\nThey believed, not as a result of receiving something or hoping for it, but of knowing Someone who was trustworthy.\nWe know Him too. Regardless of whether or not this season leaves you feeling grieved or joyful, barren or expectant, Christ’s birth intersects our circumstances with a steady, unwavering hope. May the belief in His spoken promises light our path. May our souls praise the greatness of the Lord, and may our spirits rejoice in God our Savior (Luke 1:39). Amen.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 1:57-80\nAs I write this, I am 38.5 weeks pregnant… so, fairly miserable. If you’ve ever been in these shoes you know how uncomfortable I am. Everything hurts, I can’t bend over, and my primary method of communication with friends and family entails texts utilizing either the “rage face” emoji or gifs of very overweight cats. I’ve left my last two doctor’s appointments crying hysterically because I’M STILL PREGNANT. I’ve never been more impatient than this, anxiously awaiting the sweet relief of birth—and, of course, meeting our new baby. \nAnd so, when I read about Elizabeth and Zechariah and the birth of their son, I feel every wave of their words and emotions. I know my own anticipation must be nothing compared to that of the barren Elizabeth and the mute Zechariah. I am humbled by their story. I wrestle with my own selfishness every day, shame filling my anxious heart, because I know there are so many who would give anything to be in my position. I imagine Elizabeth might’ve felt that way in the years leading up to her own pregnancy and the birth of her son.\nAdvent is our waiting season. \nMaybe you’re waiting for a baby to be conceived or born or for an older child to come home. Maybe you’re waiting for healing or love, for reconciliation or freedom. If we’re honest, we’re all waiting for something. And collectively, whether we know it or not, we’re waiting for Jesus to come again, longing for the wrongs of this world to be made right. We live an everyday Advent, longing for the final, triumphant return of our King. \nWhen he prophesies, Zechariah sings the song of an Advent people. He sings of the Lord’s steadfast faithfulness, and he knows it to be true. He blesses the Lord, remembering the Old Testament covenants that have brought the Jews to this point, recounting the promises God made to Abraham, to David, and to His people. They have been waiting 400 years to hear from the Lord, and even longer since Isaiah first told them a Messiah would come. They knew what it was to wait. \nAnd then Zechariah prophesies over his baby son with a prayer I’ve adopted for my own children, and for my own calling:\n“And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give knowledge of his salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet in the way of peace.”\n– Luke 1:76-79\nCould that be our cry, our prayer, and our calling too? Just as John the Baptist would prepare the way for the incarnate Christ, we ought to adopt his mission as our own, harkening to the day when our Jesus will come again, giving knowledge of His salvation to those who don’t yet know Him. In doing so, we await His return with purpose, spreading the good news of our precious Savior to all who will hear.\nElizabeth waited. The Jewish people waited. And we wait too. But we know our King is coming, just as we’re sure of the coming sunrise—to give light to those who sit in darkness, and to guide our feet in the way of peace.\n\nMelanie Rainer is the director of content for JellyTelly, where she writes and edits family spiritual formation resources.

For generations, God’s people had been promised a Messiah—a Rescuer, a Redeemer. For generations, they looked for Him to come. And when He did, He came quietly, meekly. Were it not for the angels’ singing, would the shepherds have known? The appearance of heavenly host made it clear: this was not to be missed. \n“Glory to God in the highest heaven,\nand peace on earth to people he favors!”\n– Luke 2:14\nAnd who did He favor, but these unsuspecting shepherds guarding their flocks in the dark? They were society’s figurative and literal outcasts, existing in the margins and living with livestock. But the angel did not mince words; this announcement was for them. “Today in the city of David a Savior was born for you…” (v. 11). All the waiting—from generation to generation, from throne rooms to sheeps’ fields—had not been in vain. \nThe baby in the manger is every promise of God fulfilled (2 Corinthians 1:20). He is the Son of God, the great light to the nations. He is the King of kings and the Prince of peace. He is faithful love and eternal hope.\nThis is the news the angels sang from the sky over the fields of Bethlehem that night. These men who had the unclean job of keeping the lambs that would be sacrificed at the temple for the sins of the people, were the first to hear that the true Passover Lamb—the spotless sacrifice born to atone for the sins of the world—had come. \nThis is Christmas—good news of great joy for the shepherds sitting outside the city in the dark. Good news of great joy for us, right where we are. \nLuke’s Gospel says when the angels left after that glorious announcement, the shepherds looked at one another and said, “Let’s go straight to Bethlehem and see what has happened, which the Lord has made known to us” (Luke 2:15). Oh, that we would do the same on this Christmas day! \nWherever you are today—whatever your longing, your need, your shortcomings, your circumstance—go straight to Bethlehem. See the baby lying in a manger, born to set us free from sin and death. See the God Most High who made Himself low. See the living, breathing hope that is for all people. Let the realities of this complicated, beautiful, broken world be enveloped in the truth that is above all truths: The Lord, your Savior, has come. Joy to the world.\n \nA Prayer for The Nativity of Our Lord: Christmas Day\nAlmighty God, you have given your only begotten Son to take our nature upon Him, and to be born this day of a pure virgin: Grant that we, who have been born again and made your children by adoption and grace, may daily be renewed by your Holy Spirit; through our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with you and the same Spirit be honor and glory, now and forever. Amen.\n\n",

Each step brought me that much closer to the newly released Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) Classic Edition. To be honest, I’m not much of a gamer myself. The truth is, I didn’t really care that much about the SNES—the hottest new Christmas present—but it was so exclusive and my husband had talked it up so much, that I found myself wanting one. Badly. \nBut halfway down the electronics aisle, I felt my dignity slip away and the red flush of embarrassment creep up onto my cheeks. I knew better than to believe a toy warranted my running through a department store like a crazy lady. \nEvery day we weigh our choices about who and what to follow, buy, and worship. We craft our identity from these choices and tend to feel pretty confident about them. We think we know what is good, cool, or smart, worthy or unworthy, as evidenced by how we spend our time and money. But what if what we thought was right, was actually wrong? What if what we thought was ugly, was truly beautiful? And what if what we thought was foolish, was really God?\nWhen I read the story of the Wise Men, I fear many of us wouldn’t have recognized the Christ child if we had been there. Embarking on a long and dangerous star chase sounds ludicrous, and falling on our knees to worship a newborn child sounds foolish. How easy it would have been to laugh at the idea of humanity’s long-awaited King coming to earth in the form of a baby. \nOur judgment is flawed, and our scales are not always calibrated to the kingdom of God. We are so quick to become proud in our own way of measuring the world. This is the problem when we are the ones attempting to hold the scales in balance, weighing and judging, and deciding what we believe to be true. \nPaul addressed this issue with the Corinthian church, telling them to be humble and boast only in the Lord. He taught that, “God has chosen what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen what is weak in the word to shame the strong” (1 Corinthians 1:27). \nThe true wisdom of the wise men was not education or reading (although they likely had much of that); it was recognizing of the face of God in the midst of what seemed foolish and weak to the world. In the presence of a vulnerable baby born to a young couple in an obscure land, the wise men fell down to worship with reckless abandon.\nTo be truly wise is to be wise in the Lord and led by the Spirit. Our own understanding will always be limited. If we make ourselves the arbitrators of truth, we will inevitably call our own Savior foolish. True wisdom comes in having the humility to admit we don’t have all the answers, that we need the Holy Spirit to show us what is true, good, and beautiful. This season, may we hand over the scales of judgment to the Lord once and for all, asking Him to lead us in the way to wisdom.\n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 2:21-40, Leviticus 12:1-8\nBabies’ lives follow a certain rhythm: eat, sleep, poop, cry. Repeat. For the infant Son of God and His mother Mary, life had likely fallen into a predictable routine, one similar to new moms today. But, in the days after she had given birth to Jesus, Mary had to submit to an older ritual that may not seem as familiar. \nAccording to the Levitical law, after childbirth a woman was considered ceremonially unclean for one week followed by another thirty-three days of isolation—double if she’d given birth to a daughter. After that time had passed, parents were instructed to go to the temple and sacrifice a one-year old lamb, or, if they couldn’t afford one, two turtledoves or two young pigeons.\nFrom our cultural standpoint, it’s hard to understand all this. The requirements seem arbitrary, confusing, and—when it comes to the post-childbirth stuff—definitely patriarchal. But if we can put down our modern-day objections for a moment, there’s something beautiful to witness in these few short verses.\nRemember: Jewish life was full of custom, ritual, and symbolism. The rites existed to remind Israelites of one story over and over again: sin separates us from God, and the only thing that atones for our sin is the blood of a spotless sacrifice. Simply put, we are unclean until something clean bleeds on our behalf. So the customs may look unfamiliar to us, but their purpose is clear. Tradition urged the people of God to grapple with their broken relationship with God.\nAnd so, following the Scripture, Mary and Joseph arrived at the temple with their baby boy and a sacrifice in hand. Luke tells us that they bought the cheaper sacrifice allowed by Leviticus: two doves or pigeons. I find it interesting that Mary and Joseph couldn’t afford a lamb, even as the baby in their arms would be the ultimate Lamb of God (John 1:29). But that’s beside the point. The main character in this passage isn’t Mary or Joseph. It’s not even Jesus. It’s Simeon. \nWhen I first read this passage, I assumed Simeon was a priest. But after reading the passage a few times over, I realized that all we’re told about Simeon was that he was a “righteous and devout” man (Luke 2:25). A man! How encouraging is it that we don’t have to hold a position in the church or in the world to play a meaningful role for God? The only things we’re told about Simeon are the only ones that matter: he loved the Lord, and he knew God’s Word. He was a man who hoped and longed for Israel’s consolation and comfort. And on the right day, at the exact right time, Simeon felt nudged by the Holy Spirit to go up to the temple. \nI wonder what he was expecting to find. I wonder if he felt excitement in his breast as he opened the door, the light pouring in on a couple and their infant son. What happened when he held Jesus and looked in His face? What did Simeon see in that little baby’s eyes? \nHe cried out as custom gave way to the Comforter.\nHe rejoiced as ritual met its match in the Redeemer.\nHe sang out, as every symbol found its perfect fulfillment in the Savior.\nSimeon’s eyes had seen the Lord’s salvation face to face in the babe who was named Jesus. Through Him, God Himself has come near to be with us, to rescue and redeem and restore us.\n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

Having grown up hearing the stories of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the God who delivered His people from Egypt, how would you have described this God?  \nPerhaps you would have depicted God as powerful and just, compassionate and good, recounting stories of the miraculous wonders He’d wrought and how faithful He’d been.\nMaybe you would have described God in more abstract terms: the burning bush, the still small voice, the pillars of cloud and fire, the daily provision of heaven-sent manna.\nOr perhaps you would’ve described Him as a holy God, one to fear and appease with burnt offerings, distant and disengaged, maybe even aloof—His ways and thoughts higher than your own and more difficult to grasp (Isaiah 55:9).\nMost likely, the Israelites possessed all manner of perceptions, just as many of us do today. However, there is one key difference between us and them, which dramatically influenced their perceptions: three thousand years ago, God had only revealed Himself in part. For generations and generations of Israelite people, God’s presence dwelled in an inaccessible place—the tabernacle, then the temple—only approachable by a select group of priests. Very rarely did God address His people directly, and only once every few hundred years.\nSo, what was God like? The Israelites had only a limited understanding, answering as children from afar. They were chosen, they were loved, and they knew many of His attributes, yet a chasm remained in between them.\nBut all of that changed in a moment as brief as the first throaty cry of a child. Suddenly, the God who was far off came near. The God who was mysterious became tangible. The God who was separate became one of us. For the first time in history, the question “What is God like?” had a short, definitive answer:\nGod is like Jesus.\nOf course, even that description is a huge understatement, because God is not simply “like” Jesus. John 10:30 tells us “the Son and the Father are one,” while Hebrews 1:3 describes Jesus as “the exact expression of [God’s] nature.” When we look at Jesus, we see God in character and essence, and that’s because Jesus is God. \nJesus’ birth was a cosmic revelation, forever changing how we would know God. Now, whenever God feels mysterious or far away, we look to Jesus. Whenever we wonder if God really loves and cares for us, we look to Jesus. Whenever we question God’s unfailing faithfulness, we look to Jesus. And whenever we doubt whether God could forgive, and even embrace, someone as flawed and broken as us, we look to Jesus. \nJesus’ life and teachings are not a replacement for the rest of Scripture—the whole of which is authoritative and inspired—but Jesus, the “Word made flesh” (John 1:14), has become the lens through which we understand God’s entire Word, and just as importantly, who God is. It’s a privilege God’s people have not always enjoyed, and one that most major religions cannot claim. But now, thanks to Christ, we can make this declaration: \nWe don’t simply know what God is like. We truly know Him. \nImmanuel Himself has come near to be with us, inviting us to seek Him with all our hearts, and when we do, He promises to be found (Isaiah 55:6; Jeremiah 20:13).\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

Oh, maybe a little extra baking powder will do the trick. \nI only have one egg and the recipe calls for two? One egg will do, and just a little extra oil for moisture. \nWhen it comes to baking, precision is required to get the correct result. But my impatience gets in the way again and again. Rather than going to the store and getting what I lack, I make do. And because of this, my baking creations have been known to elicit such comments as, “This tastes like feet.” \nThat’s what happens when you defiantly mistrust the recipe. What comes out of the oven is never what you intended. \nAfter pages of Scripture full of laws and edicts recorded in the Old Testament, salvation is boiled down to one ingredient: “For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16). \nHis only begotten Son. \nJesus Christ. \nHe is it. \nScripture lays it out so clearly. I know that Jesus is at the center. Only He brings salvation. Only He brings hope. Only He is the bread of life (John 6:41). Yet, I try to tweak the recipe.\nI feel lonely? Perhaps finding the perfect man will satisfy this longing.\nI feel out of control? Perhaps prayer and my to-do list will put my mind at ease.\nI feel anxious? Perhaps Jesus plus a little wine could help. \nI try making substitutes to the recipe, adding to it, tweaking it. But regardless of my improvisation, the result is never what I wanted. Something is always missing. Some anxiety always remains. Something always tastes… off.\nPerhaps this is why Scripture is so insistent upon the centrality of Christ. Because God knew our tendency to mistrust the recipe, to want to add to it or make our own substitutions. So again and again God’s Word homes in on this: Jesus is the only way. There is no need to complicate things any further. \nSo many days I settle for a little of Jesus and a lot of my own strength, while Christ is standing before me, saying, “Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest… For my yoke is easy and my burden is light” (Matthew 11:28,30).\nI look to the cross and then turn to every other earthly promise for fulfillment, and all the while Jesus is standing before me saying, “Truly I tell you, anyone who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life” (John 6:47-48).\nThe clearest, most life-giving recipe of all is one name, repeated over and over again.\nJesus.\nJesus.\nJesus.\nThat is it, my friends. He is it. Don’t try to add to Him. Don’t substitute Him for something else. Without Him, we perish. With Him, and only with Him, we have eternal life. \nThanks be to God for our Savior Jesus Christ. To believe and trust in Him is to feast on the bread of life sent to us from heaven. He alone brings nourishment for our souls today, and the promise of relationship with Him, both now and forevermore.\n \n",

The prophets of old delivered various parts of the same message: the people’s need for redemption and God’s plan of salvation.\n   The Old Testament prophets delivered a message they themselves did not accomplish. This sets Jesus Christ apart from all other prophets. He is both the messenger of redemption and the means through which it is accomplished.\n   Until Christ, prophets were only the bearers of God’s Word, pointing to another who would ultimately fulfill it. Christ comes to us as the Prophet bringing the words of God, but He is also the One who would accomplish the salvation He and all the other prophets proclaimed.\n   In this first week of Advent, we will look at what a prophet does: proclaims what is to come, calls for repentance, and declares God’s living Word. And we will see how Christ was the perfect Prophet and remains our perfect Prophet today, calling us to share in the work of proclaiming the message of mercy and grace He secured through His life, death, and resurrection.\n//\nA prophet proclaims what is to come. One of the main roles of a biblical prophet was to foretell the future, highlighting both the discipline and healing that would come to God’s people. Foretelling the future would often lead to repentance, while also kindling hope that God would bring lasting peace to His children.  \nEvery year I try to begin the season of Advent by convincing my children to watch A Muppet Christmas Carol with me. Sadly they missed the heyday of The Muppet Show, and are thus scared of both puppets and muppets, so they have little appreciation for Kermit as Bob Cratchit or Miss Piggy as his disgruntled wife. But to me, Charles Dickens’s classic story of Christmas Past, Present, and Future stumbles into some gospel truth.\nDickens’s ‘Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come’ whispers my worst fears about the future: the world is dark and bleak, and my own life life is deemed as worthless and regrettable as yesterday’s ashes. The future that is foretold by Dickens’s ghost hinges on the life and behavior of Ebenezer Scrooge. And I make that same assumption when I think about the future: I look to see myself. If the future depends on whether or not I’m on my best behavior, Christmas Future is bleak indeed. But when the prophets of the Bible foretell the future, the future they foretell is Christ. \nForetelling the future seems like a risky business. The punishment for getting it wrong was actual death, so it doesn’t seem worth it to idly prophesy about horse racing and love affairs. In spite of this, it’s tempting to look to the prophets for “what will happen next”—for answers to questions like, What will I get for Christmas? But a prophet’s ministry is not about doing spectacular tricks for a crowd. Still, that’s really the crackerjack truth: we would like our prophets to give us a small picture of what’s coming next. \nBiblical prophets didn’t focus on those details; they gave the big picture of what is to come. The true focus of a prophet was to proclaim, “Here is who God is,” and because of that, “Here’s what He will do.”\nAn example of a prophet foretelling the future, both in the big and small picture, is Ezekiel. He was 30 years old when he received his call to be a prophet (Ezekiel 1:1), and he spent the rest of his life prophesying about the restoration of Israel and the coming Messiah. He did give details about the rebuilding of the temple, but the big picture was this: The Messiah is coming! (Ezekiel 17:22-24; 21:25-27; 34:23-24; 37:24)\nOld Testament prophets foretold Christ’s promise to come and redeem humanity. That is Christmas. That is the answer to the bleak darkness of any future. The answer to the threat of the Assyrians was Christ. The answer to the terror of King Herod was Christ. The answer to race wars is Christ. The ultimate answer to any temporal problem is Christ.\nThe Old Testament prophets are straining and longing for the future. They are looking for fulfillment, and that fulfillment is Christ (Hebrews 1:1-2). He is the future we are longing for. He is the reason we have great hope, for “the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light” (Isaiah 9:2).\nThe future is bright. Amid the cold of winter, Christ is our bright shiny future, just as men have sung for thousands of years. The prophets foretell the future, and the future they foretell is Christ. Because of this, we can cheer with Tiny Tim, “God bless us, every one!” We can look at the days to come with courage because the truth of our future is Christ.\n \n\n",

Biblical prophets often exposed the false righteousness of God’s people and revealed their desperate need for God’s mercy. When a king or a nation’s sinfulness was uncovered, the prophet would call them to repent, reminding them of the nearness and kindness of God.\nI cried every Christmas morning for years. My mom graciously knew to just go ahead and prepare her heart. Every single year I would get my hopes up way too high and then I would be disappointed with the earrings, or sticker books, or puppy that I received under the tree. Nothing ever quite measured up to my idealized expectations of a perfect Christmas morning. I thought I was just a delicate and tender flower with a heart full of big dreams. But, daggum, if I wasn’t just years and years of being selfish and ungrateful.\nTo this day, it’s tough for me to remember that Christmas is not about me. I buy five sets of matching Christmas jammies, not really so that my kids will know the true meaning of Christ born for them, but so that I can feast my eyes on coordinated holiday squishy gorgeousness on Christmas morning. The truth is, I need to repent of even my very best moments and plans (Isaiah 64:6).\nThis is where the Old Testament prophets come in: they call God’s people to repentance. The idea of repentance fills us with fear because it means we have to let go and give up our pet sins. I don’t want to let go of my idealized expectations of Christmas morning. I’m afraid to repent of my desire to keep people at arm’s length—what will happen if I let them come closer?\nThe prophet Isaiah accused God’s people of sin and called them to repentance for thirty-nine chapters (he really drove his point home), but followed those chapters of accusation with twenty-six chapters about the hope of restoration. \nThe prophet Joel pleaded with the people to rend their hearts and not their garments: “Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity” (Joel 2:13). In the same breath, Joel called for repentance and promised reconciliation.\nWith the promises of restoration and reconciliation following so hard upon the call to repent, why do we dig in our heels and hide our faces when it comes to our own repentance? God has already promised that on the other side of that scary curtain of repentance waits welcoming arms and sweet accord. We’re afraid and hesitant for the same reason Israel was: “We are stubborn and slow to hear” (Jeremiah 35:15).\nThe prophets of old coaxed God’s people with the sweet fragrance of forgiveness. And in spite of the profound blessing and promise in restoration, repentance remains the hardest, simplest thing in the world. But the God who calls us to repentance also longs to be gracious to us (Isaiah 30:18). It is His kindness that leads us there (Romans 2:4).\n\n",

The Old Testament prophets were God’s mouthpieces, bringing God’s Word to the ears of a people who would be lost without it. As the messengers of the Word, prophets pointed to the coming Messiah who would be the Word made flesh.\nThis morning, my kids drank orange juice from glasses decorated with fall leaves and acorns. “Mom, isn’t it winter now?” they asked, innocently, just trying to keep the festive glassware in line with the appropriate season. Later, as I took my morning walk in the woods, I found remnants of spooky, fake spiderwebs and skeletons still hanging from the trees, albeit dancing with slightly enthusiasm than they once had in October… or early November. \nChristmas is coming, but we are still not quite ready. Those clackity skeletons still hang from the trees in the woods, and although someone really should take them down, they remind me of Ezekiel and those rattling dry bones. God led Ezekiel into a valley filled with dry bones, and called him to “Prophesy concerning these bones and say to them: ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!’” (Ezekiel 37:4). \nAfter he spoke these words, a quiet rattling sound twitched from the corners of the valley, welling up to a giant clamor as the bones came together, bone on bone, until the whole valley was filled with living, breathing men. These men stood as a testament to God’s promise that His might and His authority are trustworthy, even when all hope seems to be lost. And dry bones do seem to be the very essence of hope lost, gone, and dried up.\nWhen Ezekiel called to the dry bones, he spoke boldly, with the authority of the Lord. Similarly, in the Old Testament, prophets were heralds of the Lord, declaring God’s living Word with assurance. And the Word certainly bears an authoritative declaration. The Bible tells us that God’s Word is living and active (Hebrews 4:12). It is trustworthy (2 Peter 1:16-21), and God’s people are called to follow it (Deuteronomy 10:12-15). Historically, God used His prophets to make His Word known (Micah 6:6-8), and He has preserved it for us in the form of Scripture so that it can serve as a sacred, reliable guide (Deuteronomy 31:22-26, 2 Timothy 3:16-17).\nThe Old Testament prophets spoke with an authority regarded even higher than that of a king. In fact, God often used His prophets to speak uncomfortable truths to those in power (2 Samuel 12). Sometimes the kings and rulers were grateful for the help, other times they were furious. But the power and authority of God’s Word has nothing to do with our approval of its message. If it is true, we need to hear it, no matter how much we may not want to.\nThese prophets were God’s mouthpieces, bringing His Word to the ears of His people, who would be utterly lost without it. We need people who can speak God’s Word into our lives, and do so with authority. And we need to ask God for the humility to always welcome the counsel of Scripture, and to regard ourselves as people under its authority.\nGod gave real authority to His prophets. Ezekiel’s valley of dry bones hopped right to it when he spoke. God blessed the authority of His prophets to bring light, hope, and joy. Peter exhorts, “You will do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp shining in a dismal place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts” (2 Peter 1:19). God’s Word—and His message of Christmas—is that lamp shining in a dismal, dead place. When the authoritative Word of the Lord appears, it brings with it the very light and joy of life, as well as a promise: Christmas is coming!\n\n",

He was both the messenger and the message—the Word made flesh. The message He proclaimed was not about a future redemption, but one that He himself would accomplish.\nYou’ve heard of Good King Wenceslaus, but did you know he had an evil twin brother named Boleslaus?\nBorn as twin princes to a royal Czech father and a tribal Slav mother, Wenceslaus and Boleslaus were the heirs to the throne in Bohemia. Boleslaus was raised at court by his pagan parents, but Wenceslaus was raised in the country by his Christian grandmother, Ludmila.\nWenceslaus was a good king because he not only proclaimed the gospel, but attentively lived and ruled by it.\nWhen Wenceslaus inherited the throne, he established scriptural standards of justice and mercy throughout the kingdom. And the kingdom prospered under the young king’s generous rule. He applied the truths of the gospel to the practical aspects of both the governing and treatment of his fellow man. Renowned for his kindness to the poor, Wenceslaus was loved and celebrated by his people. \nMeanwhile, his brother, who history unfortunately remembers as “Boleslaus the Cruel,” was filled with jealousy. Boleslaus waited for a cold morning and ambushed Wenceslaus, assassinating him and living up to his name. After his assassination, Wenceslaus was celebrated as a martyr. \nThe moral of this story is not “live like Good King Wenceslaus.” Even the king himself would agree. As with the story of any good king, the lesson is to live like Christ. It was Wenceslaus’s love for Christ that translated into benevolence toward his people. He looked to Christ’s perfect example, and brought the goodness of the gospel to Bohemia. \nChrist is also our perfect example—and not just our example, but our Savior.\nChrist is the perfect prophet. He is both the message and the messenger. He is the Word made flesh. Think back on the offices of a prophet we’ve studied so far this week, and look how Christ performs all of these roles with His very person:\nHe is the perfect Prophet because He proclaims what is to come, and the future He proclaims is Christ glorified (Luke 4). Christ is the perfect Prophet because He both proclaims our freedom and accomplishes it. He is more than just another prophet; He is the Prophet who accomplishes His own mission of salvation. \nHe is the perfect Prophet because He calls for repentance and offers us forgiveness (Matthew 4:17). He is the embodiment of both justice and mercy.\nHe is the perfect Prophet because He declares God’s living Word. He is at the same time the prophet and the message. He is the living Word (John 1:1-14).\nWhile Christ is Himself the perfect Prophet, He also fulfills and reinforces the Old Testament prophets. Their words still matter, and they matter because of Christ (Matthew 5:17). This is God’s love for us: that while we were in darkness, He showed His love by bringing light and being the light. \nChrist is both prophet and prophecy. He is both the messenger and the message. Thanks be to God!\n\n",

He calls us to share in the work of proclaiming the message of mercy and grace He secured through His life, death, and resurrection. When we bear witness to Him, we point to the same salvation the prophets of old proclaimed.\nI just can’t catch the Gingerbread Man. Every time he crops up in a children’s book, running and taunting, I grit my teeth and manage to soldier on through the story, but I just get so mad at that spicy little gingerbread guy. He seems to will himself into existence, then taunt his creator; always running, always causing mischief. I want to send him to bed without any gumdrops or sugarplums.\nBut I can’t send him to bed, because no one seems to be able to catch him. The Gingerbread Man probably originated in 15th century German fairy tales. In Europe, he’s known as “The Fleeing Pancake,” which, while possibly sounding even more infuriating, is such a wonderfully descriptive phrase that I may just throw my fairy tale books in the bushes and give him the chase after all.\n“Run, run as fast as you can. You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man.”\nI’m afraid it’s so infuriating because it’s just so close to home. God created me in His image, and I spring up, shaking my tiny gingerbread fist at Him, and run—hard and fast—like a dog who has stolen a turkey leg right off the table. Do you find yourself running and shaking your fist, tweaking noses and pulling ponytails as you go?\nWe all lean full tilt in the direction of that Gingerbread Man. We run from our Creator, we ignore His prophets, and we turn our faces from Truth. \nOur hearts are inclined to hate the words of authority. Jesus knew this, saying “I assure you: No prophet is accepted in his hometown” (Luke 4:24). When we see the truth we are often quick to bury it and run from it.\nIn spite of our best efforts to run, Christ remains the one perfect Prophet today. Indeed, He alone can unfold to us the Word of Truth. He alone can fulfill it. He calls us to share in the work of proclaiming the message of mercy and grace He secured through His life, death, and resurrection. He exhorts us, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word” (John 14:23). When we bear witness to Him, we point to the same salvation the prophets of old proclaimed.\nIn the past, Christ ministered as a prophet by both prophesying and fulfilling prophesy. He continues to minister to us today through His Word, the Bible. Just as the prophet is God’s messenger, His Word is His message to us. Because Christ is ascended, His prophetic Word is authoritative and trustworthy, and He promises heaven to those who believe in Him. \nGod makes His people His own. It is His great ministry of mercy, that He makes us His own despite the fact that we run like fleeing pancakes away from Him. \nOur sinful hearts urge: “Run, run as fast as you can.”\nAnd we run, but the prophet Isaiah’s words ring stronger, clearer, and truer:\n“And a highway shall be there,\nand it shall be called the Way of Holiness;\nthe unclean shall not pass over it.\nIt shall belong to those who walk on the way;\neven if they are fools, they shall not go astray.”\n– Isaiah 35:8\nEven though our gingerbread feet are inclined to run, Christ’s prophetic ministry drives out our waywardness, and graciously makes us His own (Matthew 8:16-17).\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Deuteronomy 6:1-9, 1 Chronicles 16:4-9, Romans 12:1-12\nPRIEST INTRODUCTION\n   “Every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifice, which can never take away sins. But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God…” (Hebrews 10:11-12 ESV).\nIn the Old Testament, priests tended to the tabernacle, where the presence of God was said to dwell. Their work was bloody and holy, as they brought imperfect sacrifices for imperfect people before a Holy God, asking Him to forgive them. There was no chair for the priests in the temple because their work was never done.\n   Today, there is a more perfect tabernacle—the throne room of God. In it, there is a chair for our High Priest. And in that chair sits Jesus, who has brought us peace with God by becoming the perfect sacrifice the Lord accepted. Jesus makes intercession for us based upon the offering of His own flesh and blood.\n   This week we will look at what a priest does: calls people to worship, cares for their spiritual lives, and makes intercession for them. And we will see how Christ came as the perfect Priest and remains our perfect Priest today, calling us to share in the work of caring for the hearts of others.\n//\nA priest calls people to worship. One of the main roles of a biblical priest was to anchor God’s people in the habit of regular worship, returning them again and again to the practices of gathering together to celebrate together the holiness and mercy of God.\nWhen I was seven, my favorite thing to do was play school or store with Mary Marson. Mary lived a couple doors down from us, on the other side of the street. She was a few years older than me, but gracious enough to let a little kid hang out in her garage now and then after school, pretending we were teachers or students or store clerks.\nThe part I liked most about our “work” was the writing—not shaping words into sentences, but the actual, physical act of putting pen to paper. I loved filling out forms and drawing up bills, or making fill-in-the-blank homework sheets for our imaginary students. My dad ran golf courses for a living, and sometimes I’d strike gold in the way of nabbing an old ordering pad from the grill or a half-used bank ledger from behind the desk. To this day, I love filling out a good form.\nYou’d never have guessed that the seven-year-old who loved all things administrative would grow up to be one of the least organizationally inclined humans to ever grace a staff meeting. Oh, I can fill in the blanks like a champ. But please do not ask me to do math, organize a classroom, create an inventory system, or—heaven forbid—make a spreadsheet. Little Amanda was cute with her pigtails sticking out of her bandana, but she was not a reliable predictor of the future.\nGrownup Amanda has a computer desktop akin to a junkyard and a rather unhealthy reliance on iCal for everything from remembering her husband’s birthday, to picking up her kids from school. Calendar alerts are a grace, my friends.\nThe hearts of Old Testament Israel looked like my sad, scattered desktop. Truth be told, we all have hearts so easily distracted and forgetful, not even iCal can help us. We need constant reminders of who God is and who we are.\nAnd not just that—we need new hearts altogether.\nThe Old Testament priests could not give God’s people new hearts, but they could orient their broken hearts toward God and the things of God. They called God’s people to worship, regularly anchoring them in the habit of recognizing and celebrating God’s holiness and mercy. They gathered God’s people together and told them what was true: God is God and we are not.\nA priest’s job was to echo the words of Moses from Deuteronomy 6: \n“Listen, Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is One. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.”\n– Deuteronomy 6:4-5\nThey drew God’s people into worship, and the people, in turn, were to draw each other into worship, generation after generation.\n“These words that I am giving you today are to be in your heart. Repeat them to your children. Talk about them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.”\n– Deuteronomy 6:6-7\nThe priests of the Old Testament taught what the Apostle Paul would later declare: Worship does not stop when the worship gathering ends. Our very lives are to be acts of worship (see Romans 12:1-2).\nYou and I come by our scattered-heartedness honestly. Since the moment Eve ate the fruit and Adam followed suit, we’ve depended on these holy reminders to call our hearts back to our Maker. Fellowship with God is what we were created for, but it no longer comes naturally. With that first sin, we became like compasses with no true north, our needles spinning round, not knowing where to stop.\nPriests helped restore direction to the hearts of God’s people. They pointed the people to God, held up His Word, and called them back to worship. Priests reminded God’s people who they were: they were not God, but they were God’s. They belonged to Him.\nBy the grace of Jesus, we do too. \n\n",

The job of a priest in the Old Testament was to read the spiritual posture of God’s people and attend to their fears and sorrows. Priests called the people to see themselves as they really were—needy but loved, frail but protected, prone to wander but kept. They served God’s people by reminding them that they were made for worship.\nI confess: I used to silently pass judgment on parents who used those kid-leashes on their children. And then I had twin boys. \nI remember buying a set of two such contraptions at the parents-of-multiples consignment sale when our boy babies were becoming toddlers. It was our one-stop shop for all the twin things, and it made me feel deeply understood simply to wander among the aisles of coordinating onesies and matching highchairs. By this point, of course, I’d met my boys and discovered just how, um, “lively” they were. They’d be on the move soon, and judging from the number of times they’d already overturned the toy shelf in their room, it was time to prepare our hearts and our home. \nWe didn’t know we’d come to envy the parents we once judged. At least their kids could be contained by such desperate measures. Our boys, on the other hand, were so rambunctious, they’d physically injure themselves (or us) when tethered via a puppy dog backpack.\nThe truth was I’d underestimated how difficult it would be to simply keep my boys near me—to keep them in the fold, so to speak. We opted for fenced-in playgrounds in their younger years to avoid the likely probability that they’d run toward the street in opposite directions and I’d have to choose which one to rescue first. I felt like a lifeguard, always on duty, always scanning the room or yard or park for those two little blonde heads, constantly fighting fear that I’d lose one or leave one behind.\nBless caregivers of little ones everywhere. I’m exhausted just writing this.\nGod’s priests in the Old Testament knew well the work of keeping their sheep within the fold. Shepherding was part of their job—not sheep, of course, but hearts. The hearts of God’s people—ever wandering, ever forgetful—needed the watchful eye of the priest to keep them close, to read their spiritual posture and anticipate their spiritual needs. In the same way that priests reminded God’s people who they were and Who they were made to worship, they also reminded them how to walk in light of those truths.\nGod’s people were needy, but loved. They were frail, but protected. They were prone to wander, but kept. The priesthood was a gift from God for both the people and the temple. The priests watched over the people for the sake of the temple, and watched over the temple for the sake of the people. It was heavy, holy work.\nAs God’s people today, we are just as needy, frail, and prone to wander as our Old Testament brothers and sisters. We, too, benefit greatly from the gift of shepherds who lead the people of the Church in the ways of God. But there is one crucial distinction: you and I no longer rely on any priest or guide to keep us in the fold. We have a Savior who does that.\nThere would come a perfect Priest into the world who would not just make it improbable but impossible for us to be separated from God’s covenant love. He would be the Shepherd of shepherds, the Messiah, and He was coming to be our forever priest.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Exodus 30:1-10, Leviticus 6:1-7, Hebrews 5:1-4, Hebrews 9:12\nPriests made intercession for the sins of the people. The Old Testament priests brought the sin offerings of Israel into the presence of God and asked the Lord to receive the offerings and forgive the people. Priests were mediators, set apart for the bloody, solemn work of interceding through prayer and sacrifice. Their role existed because the people were never without guilt.\nMy father and I didn’t see eye to eye about my post-college plans. I had gone to a respectable school, earned a pair of respectable degrees, and taken out my respectable share of student loans. The job was done, and it was time for the real work to begin. So, I did what any newly qualified college graduate does: I accepted an unpaid internship that had nothing to do with my degrees.\nDad wasn’t mad at me, necessarily. But he certainly wasn’t happy.\nAt the time I was driving a light green Mazda 626, nicknamed “the Beast” for the frequency with which it required costly repairs. The bank loan for “my” used car was in my name and my dad’s, and I was responsible for the monthly payment: $296, if I remember correctly. The unpaid internship offered a monthly stipend that was roughly $100 more than that amount.\nEach month, I sent the lion’s share of my paycheck to my hometown bank with a slip from that car payment book. And each month, I stretched the remaining dollars to pay for meals, clothes, gas, and an occasional coffee. This was my modus operandi for several months, until Christmas of that same year. In the Christmas of 2001, in the house where I grew up, my dad handed me a small, wrapped box. Inside was the Beast’s payment book, its pages stamped “paid.” \nMy dad had paid in full the debt I couldn’t.\nThe priests of the Old Testament had the somber and bloody task of making payments on the sin-debt of God’s people, offering regular sacrifices on their behalf. The Messiah—the One the prophets foretold—had not yet come, and the sins of the people had to be atoned for as prescribed by God’s law. God is always and completely holy, so the priests stayed busy, interceding with prayers and sacrifices for the sin-plagued hearts of God’s people.\nIt is believed there was no chair in the temple because the priest’s work was never done. “The altar is especially holy to the Lord” (Exodus 30:10). When could a priest possibly rest?\nOld Testament priests were constantly making payments on a debt they could never eliminate. Only Jesus could mark it paid in full. But Jesus hadn’t come yet; only the promise of Jesus had come.\nWhen my dad paid off my car loan, it wasn’t just freedom from debt that I celebrated. It was my father’s love—his approval. In this one act, he had demonstrated that he accepted me right where I was, no strings attached. It was a true gift of love, given but not earned.\nMy dad was a good man, but he is not my savior. The priests of the Old Testament were called by God to intercede for the people, but they were not messiahs. Hebrews 5 says of the priest, “He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he is also subject to weakness. Because of this, he must make a sin offering for himself as well as for the people” (vv. 2-3).\nOnly Jesus could give what the souls of the people—and yes, the priests—really needed. Only Christ could provide the ultimate sacrifice that would pay all our debts and theirs, “once for all” (Hebrews 9:12). Only Christ could offer complete love and unmerited favor to sinners the likes of us.\nThanks be to God, the true Priest was coming. \n\n",

He was both the One who stood in the presence of God and the perfect sacrifice the Father accepted. To call His people to worship, Christ humbled Himself by taking the form of a man and was exalted to the highest place. To care for the spiritual lives of His people, He gave the Holy Spirit. To intercede for them, He took their sin upon Himself. \nWe did spontaneous jumping jacks at work today. I’d been sitting at my desk for six hours, trying in vain to shrink my ever-growing list of to-dos, staring at my laptop and typing and clicking and working like mad to catch up on All The Stuff. Six hours of sitting, and it was all I could do to not lay my head down and go to sleep right there in my office. So, I stood up.\nThat’s how the jumping jacks started.\nI was pacing the office, making the rounds (which is what I call it when I’m having trouble being productive, so I walk around to everyone else’s desk and interrupt their productivity), but that wasn’t enough. So, naturally, I started punching the air. Then kicking, then jumping up and down. Before I knew it, there were four of us standing in a circle, trying to learn some kind of fancy “coordinated” jumping jacks from Cymone.\nDon’t worry. We documented this on video.\nAs I read today’s Scripture, on jumping jack day, it occurs to me how very weak we are. We struggle at every turn—struggle to do more, struggle to do less, struggle to speed up or slow down, to save up or pare down. Sometimes I think we aren’t even sure what we’re doing, to be honest. We have fickle hearts with good intentions. We have ambitious minds that think too hard and hard-working hands that mean well. And still, we miss the mark. The bullseye is perfection, and we miss it by a mile.\nScripture uses another, better word for perfection: holiness. The word “holy” means “consecrated” or “set apart.” God is holy, and we are not. He is set apart from us, and we cannot reach Him on our own; our sin makes it impossible for us to know and commune with our Creator-God the way we were created to. That’s why the priests of the Old Testament made sacrifices so religiously and meticulously: they were atoning for the sins of the people—and for their own sins, too. They were making a way for the people to be in God’s presence, by offering the blood of bulls and goats and doves. The priests never sat down in the temple because their work of intercession—or mediation—on behalf of the people was never done.\nBut then came Christ, the perfect Priest who ministered to God’s people in a perfect way. Jesus led God’s people in worshiping God, by first humbling Himself and wrapping His divinity in flesh (John 1:14). He cared for their souls by offering them grace, mercy, and love in real-time, and by giving the Holy Spirit to be with them forever (John 14:16). He interceded for them by taking on their sin and dying in their stead (Isaiah 53:11). The perfect Priest was also the perfect sacrifice—given once for all time, for all who believe.\nAnd then He sat down.\n“After making purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high” (Hebrews 1:3). The sacrifice was done. It was—and is still—finished (John 19:30).\nMeanwhile, we just can’t seem to sit still. We think there is always more to do.\nIn these sacred days of Advent, we remember that the ultimate task has already been accomplished. Our perfect Priest has come, and has become the perfect sacrifice to make purification for all our sins—past, present, and future.\nOur God is still and forever holy, set apart like a fire. But “because of His great love for us we are not consumed” (Lamentations 3:22). Jesus has made a way to the Father. Christ was born for this. Hallelujah!\n\n",

He sits at the right hand of God, ruling over all creation. All that the Father has given will come to Him, and He will not lose any of His own. He draws us into worship, He cares for our spiritual lives, and He continues to make intercession for us.\nHistory class was wasted on me. All those names and dates and stories were woefully uninteresting to me at the time, which seems like a tragedy now that I know better. If I could turn back time, I’d let myself make most of the same mistakes, I think, but I would definitely pay more attention in history class.\nIt’s a common misconception when we’re young and invincible—that what happened in the past no longer affects us in the present. Besides, the present is exciting and entertaining and, well, alive. Why spend time talking about dead guys?\nI’ve taken this approach with Jesus more often than I want to admit. I think of His life in the past tense—how He lived and how He died, how He rose from the grave, triumphant over death. But then I hit the pause button, and there the risen Jesus stays—frozen in a cloud, mid-ascension, twiddling His glorified thumbs.\nBut Jesus is not finished. His work on the cross is finished—it is perfect and complete (John 19:30). But His work as our Great High Priest continues. Jesus was the perfect Priest who became the spotless sacrifice, but His priesthood is ongoing. Christ died to save us, and now He lives to intercede for us before the Father (Hebrews 7:25).\nOur Savior, who took on our sin and granted us His righteousness, is the One who sits at the Father’s right hand, claiming as His own those He died to save (1 John 4:10). He shepherds us even now, fulfilling the promise that none of His children will be snatched out of His hand (John 10:29). He knows our weakness, as He Himself experienced humanity in its fullness but did not sin (Hebrews 4:15). And just as He saved us “once for all” by His death on the cross (Hebrews 9:12), He saves us still, granting grace and mercy as our advocate before God and our admittance into God’s presence (1 John 2:2).  \nWe don’t hope today in a static story about a commendable dead guy. We hope today in the reality of the risen Christ—our forever Priest who is as alive today as He was when He walked out of the grave.\nThough we stood on the opposite shore of the great chasm created by our sin, separated from our holy God, Jesus’ blood made a way for us to be reconciled to God—welcomed at His throne as heirs with Christ (1 Peter 1:18-19, Hebrews 4:16). Our priest has become our brother (Hebrews 2:11). The call to be holy—to be imitators of our holy God—is not an idle request; it is a reality of the redemption being worked out in us by our Great High Priest (1 Peter 1:15). This is the unmatched, unlimited grace of the God who has saved us fully and is saving us still.\nOffer your worship today to the perfect Priest who became the perfect sacrifice­—the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world and intercedes for us before the Father (John 1:9).\nThanks be to God.   \n\n",

He came to earth in the humblest way imaginable—lowly in a manger, as a fragile baby. But that baby in that stable in Bethlehem was born King of the Jews, or more specifically, King of the people of God.\nHe did not come as the people expected—as One who would conquer and rule the nations.  His purpose was to restore humanity’s broken relationship with God. And He has. All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him, and He will never hand it over to another. He conquers us, protects us, and keeps us. To submit to His rule over us as our King is an act of worship.\nIn this section, we will look at what a king does: he fights battles, represents his people before God, and humbly serves his subjects. And we will see how Christ came as the perfect King and remains our perfect King today, calling us to share in His holy work of serving others who bear the image of God.\n//\nA king fights battles. In the Old Testament, this often meant the king chose which battles to fight. He needed to be both brave and discerning, knowing the battles he chose would be fought by the people he led. A selfish, foolish king would be dreaded by his subjects, but a humble, wise king could lead his people to the freedom and peace their hearts longed for.\nIsrael was set apart, but all they wanted was to blend in.\nThe nation may not have looked like much, but they were head and shoulders above all other nations in that they were God’s chosen people, led by Him, protected by Him, and ruled by Him. Yet, they desired something less, thinking it might be something more.\nSound familiar?\nIt makes me think of another time a crowd demanded a similar trade. Offering the Son of God Himself, in the flesh and walking among them, they shouted at Him all the way to His death at Calvary, “We have no king but Caesar!” (John 19:15). Even with the Word made flesh in their midst, they exchanged the power of God for the weakness of man. Like Adam and Even in the garden, they traded reliance on God for rotting fruit.\nEven today, the people of God have a habit of trading in a King who will reign forever, for one who is passing away. \nIn the Old Testament, the duty of a king was to be wise, to fight battles, to protect and serve his people with bravery and discernment. With a warning against their choice (1 Samuel 8:10-18), God gave Israel her first king—King Saul, “a handsome young man… From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people” (1 Samuel 9:2).\nIsrael wanted Saul to fight their battles. They trusted him to be kind and fair. But no one is good like God. It’s a lesson God’s people have been learning since their beginning.\nWhat about us today? Who are we trusting to be brave and discerning, to go before us into battle? Are we crying out for man to be our defense, or do we act as if we believe that our God is King over all, even today, seated on the throne of heaven with earth as His footstool (Isaiah 66:1)?\nIf we are in Christ, our citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20), and we serve the one, true King of all earthly kings—yes, every one of them. \nBelieve today that He will fight your battles.\nPray even now that He will go before you.\nBelieve that He will, as He promised, “command His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways” (Psalm 91:11). He alone is our sure defense (Psalm 94:22).\n“These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him are the called and chosen and faithful.”\n-Revelation 17:14\n\n",

When Israel’s kings followed the Lord, the nation experienced God’s blessing. But when her kings rejected the Lord, the people often suffered for it because the king represented the nation. Often, as it went for the king, so it went for the people.\nI’ve never liked politics. I try to toe the line somewhere between being a responsible and engaged citizen and maintaining my sanity through a healthy dose of blissful ignorance. It isn’t that I don’t care; it’s the opposite. I do care, and the implications of political decisions overwhelm me. How can frail, human shoulders bear so much weight? \nIsrael’s kings knew this weightiness well, in a way our modern-day leaders often seem to forget. They knew from experience the far-reaching implications of how they chose to represent their people before God. When they followed the Lord, the nation experienced God’s blessing. But when a king rejected the Lord, the people often suffered for it because the king represented the nation. Often, as it went for the king, so it went for the people.\nTake Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, for example. He feared the Lord, and during the third year of his reign, he sent 16 teachers throughout the land to reeducate the people about God’s law. \n“The Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David. He did not seek the Baals, but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments… Therefore the Lord established the kingdom in his hand… And the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, and they made no war against Jehoshaphat.”\n– 2 Chronicles 17:3-5, 10\nZedekiah, on the other hand, did not fear the Lord. Some 300 years (and a full gamut of good and bad kings) later, King Zedekiah “did what was evil in the sight of the Lord” and God “cast them out from his presence.” Finally, “in the ninth year of his reign… Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and laid siege to it” (Jeremiah 52:2-4). It was at the close of yet another unrighteous king’s reign that the temple was burned (52:13), the walls of Jerusalem were broken down (52:14), and nearly 5,000 of God’s chosen people were exiled to Babylon (52:30).\nAs it went for the king, so it went for the people—for better and for worse. \nWhen a king interceded on behalf of his people, the nation was often protected from outside attacks. When he educated them in the law of the Lord and walked in the ways of God, the nation would experience blessing. \nThe kingdoms of Israel and Judah remained at the mercy of their good and bad kings throughout the Old Testament, but a King of kings would come—One who walked perfectly with God, though we and our kings do not. Even the good kings had flaws, and Israel would always be in need of righteous representation before God. But one King was coming—indeed, He is already here!—who would be our righteous representative. \nIt may not always appear as though our King represents us the way we wish He would, or that He protects us from wars and exile and destruction the way we think He should, but “our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world powers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens” (Ephesians 6:12). \nJesus Christ, our perfect and just King, rules above all kings of earth—past, present, and future. We place our hope in Him today—not in “men who cannot save” (Psalm 146:3), but in our righteous, forever King. \nChrist has overcome the world (John 16:33). Thanks be to God! \n\n",

A king’s job in the Old Testament was to know what his people needed and to lead in such a way that they would have it. He was to lay down his life for his people, using his powerful position to secure for them what only he could. Doing this well required great humility. \n“Look for the helpers.”\nIt was Mr. Rogers who shared this insight with us—advice his own mother gave him when he would see scary things happening as a child. “You will always find people who are helping.”\nHave you seen them? Men or women risking their comfort, their time, their very lives to serve or even rescue others? They’re the helpers. And in a very real sense, Solomon was the helper to the people of Israel.\nIn 2 Chronicles 1, God said to Solomon, “Ask. What should I give you?” (v. 7). The God of the universe offered the new king whatever his heart desired. This is how we know Solomon was a humble king: he put the care of his people ahead of his own glory by asking God to make him a better ruler for them. “Now grant me wisdom and knowledge so that I may lead these people, for who can judge this great people of Yours?” (v. 10).\nNot riches, not wealth or glory or long life, or even the destruction of his enemies. Solomon understood even in his answer what some leaders never realize: power is not simply found in a display of strength or force. True power is displayed in humility. The Old Testament kings of Israel and Judah who followed and feared God understood this. And Jesus, of course, would be the ultimate demonstration of this power. \nA good king is always a helper. But sometimes, the better the helper, the harder he is to spot. Can you find the helper-King in Matthew 27:41-43?\n“So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, ‘He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.’” \nJesus Himself was the helper—humbly sacrificing His life for ours. It didn’t look much like heroism, but it was the most selfless act of royal rescue in human history. Jesus gave the help Israel needed—the help they didn’t know they needed, the help only He could give. His demonstration of power didn’t look like brute force at all. In fact, to the world it looked a little like weakness. He knew His people’s greatest need and was obedient even unto death to secure it for them. This is what makes Him the King of kings. \nSolomon humbly, yet imperfectly, ruled over Israel, giving them a continued awareness of their need for a perfect King. They ached for that King. They believed God’s prophets who said He would come, and they rejoiced on behalf of the generations to come who would one day know Him. \nRejoice greatly, Daughter Zion!\nShout in triumph, Daughter Jerusalem!\nLook, your King is coming to you;\nHe is righteous and victorious,\nhumble and riding on a donkey,\non a colt, the foal of a donkey.\n– Zechariah 9:9\nDo you see the Helper? Righteous and victorious. Humble and riding on a donkey. \nHe’s coming. Hallelujah, He is coming!\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nText: John 18:37, Psalm 103:15-22, Zechariah 6:12-13, Matthew 2:1-6\nChrist came as the perfect King. He came with all authority in heaven and earth, but also in the humblest way imaginable—in a lowly manger, as a fragile baby. Yet He would command the demons and they would obey, He would speak to storms and they would still, He would touch the afflicted and they would be healed. Jesus’ life was an act of service, His death a display of humility, and His resurrection a demonstration of power unlike anything the world had ever seen.\nMy first experience with kings and kingdoms was Disney’s Robin Hood at age 5.\nPrince John, a mane-less lion, was puny and greedy and insecure. His only friend was a snake, and his subjects suffered disease and poverty under his tyrannical taxing and dishonorable reign.\nThe movie comes to a blissful resolution with a wedding. Prince John is replaced by the true and better king, King Richard the Lionheart (an actual lion in the cartoon version of the movie). Finally home from the Crusades, King Richard takes the crown to restore his people and rule them with wisdom, generosity, and kindness.\nThe movie is a caricature of actual events in 12th century England, but 5-year-old Raechel simply saw the forest creatures of Nottingham aching for a true and better king to rule them. King Richard, for his 10 seconds of actual screen time, assured me that he would be all of that and more. “All hail King Richard!” the creatures chant, as Robin Hood and Maid Marian wed and ride off in their carriage to live happily ever after.\nLegend tells us that the real King Richard was a full foot taller than his younger brother John, that he was handsome and had a great head of hair. (Everyone loves a great head of hair.) This, perhaps, is where King Richard and King Jesus differ. The prophet Isaiah tells us about our King:\n“He didn’t have an impressive form\nor majesty that we should look at Him,\nno appearance that we should desire Him.\nHe was despised and rejected by men,\na man of suffering who knew what sickness was.\nHe was like someone people turned away from;\nHe was despised, and we didn’t value Him.”\n– Isaiah 53:2-3\nJust like King Richard came to rule England in the cartoon version of his life as the perfect king with all authority, Jesus came in the actual flesh to rule not only mankind with justice and mercy, but also to rule the demons, the wind and waves, and even disease. Jesus came to be King—not made fit to rule because of His appearance, but because of His holiness and the ransom He paid.\nWe’ve studied Old Testament kings enough to know they ranged from good to bad to downright villainous. Jehoshaphat righteously reeducated Israel in God’s law, Solomon asked for wisdom to be a helper to his people, and Zedekiah lost the temple, his life, and his people to Babylonian captivity. It wasn’t that they were “phony kings” like Prince John, but even the righteous kings would fall short (like Solomon who did evil when he grew older). Or, as the rooster-narrator croons, “King Richard’s crown keeps slipping down around that pointed head.”\nA perfect King was coming. It was only a matter of time.\nToday, nearing the end of the third week of Advent, we recognize and worship Christ, the perfect King. Sure, we can draw connections between the humble and righteous reign of King Jesus and favorite childhood movies because we, like Robin Hood, are “Pardoned by order of the King,” or because He has “an outlaw for an in-law” in us. But all that (true) fun aside, we have even more to celebrate today. Our King is coming—and indeed has already come—to set right an upside-down world. \n“Jesus answered, ‘You say correctly that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, to testify to the truth’.”\n– John 18:37\n“The Lord has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all.”\n– Psalm 103:19\nAll hail King Jesus!\n",

All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him, and He will never hand it over to another. His life, death, and resurrection demonstrated the authority He continues to exercise as the Son of God who rules at the right hand of the Father. The baby born in Bethlehem holds creation in His gracious grip, and He always will.\nMy son has a favorite Christmas carol. \nWhen we get in the car at Christmastime, our family takes turns picking the first four songs we’ll listen to. Our daughter always asks for LeAnn Rimes’s “I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas.” Ryan picks a different vintage song every time, and I make sure no one speaks while Amy Grant serenades us about a “Tender Tennessee Christmas.” (“The only sounds you can make are if you’re singing along,” I insist, before closing my eyes to belt out about “the only Christmas for meeee.”)\nBut Oliver always chooses “Joy to the World.” I love that about him. And, it gives me ample opportunity to let the non-hippopotamus-related lyrics stick with me. Perhaps one of my many favorite lines from the song comes from that very first verse: \n“Let earth receive her King!” \nI know it’s not Scripture, but Isaac Watts knew the Truth as he wrote these lyrics. He knew Christ was not only King over all mankind, but over the entire earth. He knew that the rocks, hills, and floods answer to the same judge you and I answer to—this King rules over all things, “far as the curse is found.” (And be assured, that doggone curse is everywhere.)\nChrist is our King today. Not because we decide He is, but because God Himself gave Him this authority. \n“All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.”\n– Matthew 28:18\nHe is our King whether we bow to Him or not. He is the King of the leaders of the countries of the world, whether they believe it or not. He is the King of our children and our friends and enemies, whether they receive Him or not. \nThis is good news! Not only does our King rule over everyone and everything, He is also a righteous and merciful judge. And He comes to make His blessings flow. Yes, He is a good King. \nIn the Old Testament, God’s people relied on prophets to be the mouthpiece of God, priests to lead them to worship and make sacrifices for their sin, and kings to uphold the law and fight their battles. But no prophet, priest, or king, no matter how righteous, could fulfill their office to the extent of the people’s need. \nThe prophets could report God’s promises to the people, but Jesus was both the Promiser and the “yes” to every promise God had made (2 Corinthians 1:20).\nThe blood of bulls and goats would never be enough to atone for sins of a nation, but the blood of Christ—our great high Priest—is enough to atone for the sins of all nations (Hebrews 10:4).\nThe kings of Israel and Judah ruled the people, fought their battles, and protected them from oppressors, and they did none of it perfectly. But King Jesus is seated on the throne of heaven, always fighting for us in battles that are “not against flesh and blood’ (Ephesians 6:12), “judging the world righteously and the peoples fairly” (Psalm 98:9).\nChrist is our King today. Whether we call Him our King or not, He is seated on the throne at the right hand of the Father as you read these words. He is King of heaven and nature, far as the curse is found. Will you bow to your King? Will you submit yourself to His laws? Find security in the borders He has drawn? Christ is your perfect King—the King of all kings. Will you receive Him to be your King today?\nHe rules the world with truth and grace,\nAnd makes the nations prove\nThe glories of his righteousness,\nAnd wonders of his love,\nAnd wonders of his love,\nAnd wonders, wonders, of his love.\n\n",

It also seemed good to me, since I have carefully investigated everything from the very first, to write to you in an orderly sequence, most honorable Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things about which you have been instructed” (Luke 1:1-4).\n    In the beginning of Luke’s Gospel, he tells his readers he is writing to give an “orderly sequence” of Jesus’ life. Luke anchors his Gospel in verifiable historical markers because he wants us to know that the story he is telling really happened.\n    If Luke’s account is only a myth, it means nothing. But if it is true—if the Son of God came not only to live among us, but to die for us and rise to life and give that life to all who trust in His name—then the coming of Christ, the Prince of Peace, has changed the world and our place in it.\n    In these days leading up to Christmas, we’ll read the detailed narrative of the Nativity according to Luke. Luke’s Gospel gives us the fullest account of the Nativity story, walking us through the people, places, and divine interventions which led to the birth of the Savior of the world. May the story of Jesus’ birth cause our celebration of Christmas to be marked by our worship of Him.\n//\nOne of my favorite memories of our twin girls is from last Christmas Eve. After lighting that last candle and launching into a surprisingly spirited rendition of “Silent Night,” we bowed our heads to pray—and I peeked. Sometimes I can’t help myself, hearing the expectant innocence in their prayers. When I opened my eyes I saw one daughter, hands clasped against her bowing head as she murmured her prayer. The other sat eyes wide open, cheeks smushed and chin resting in her hands, as she stared into the candlelight, waiting. \nIn that moment, I saw my own relationship with the Lord: the praying and the waiting. Because while I try to attune my heart to His in prayer, to wait on Him, I find that sometimes—well, it’s just hard to wait. \nZechariah was a faithful priest who also happened to be in the business of waiting. Scripture tells us he and his wife, Elizabeth, were good people, “righteous before God, walking blamelessly” with Him. “But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years” (Luke 1:5-7). These two people, believed to be in their eighties at the time, had hoped for a child their whole lives. At what age do you think they stopped praying for that child? How many years had passed since then?\nBut that wasn’t the only waiting Zechariah was accustomed to. After decades of faithfully serving as a priest, he was chosen by lot to enter the holy place on the Day of Atonement and burn incense—a symbol of prayer (Revelation 5:8; 8:3-4)—on behalf of the people who were praying outside the temple (Luke 1:9-10).\nAs one of 8,000 priests serving in Palestine at that time, this would be the one and only time Zechariah would enter into the holy place and perform this duty. It was in this moment that the Lord sent His angel Gabriel to meet Zechariah at the altar and say, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John“ (Luke 1:13).\nI imagine Zechariah’s ears might’ve started ringing just then, intermingled with words like: joy… Holy Spirit… womb… make ready for the Lord. Because he was a real man living with the very real, lifetime-long grief of being childless in a culture that placed great value on children. His prayer had never been answered until now—at least, not with a “yes.” Things can happen to a heart that waits and hopes and longs for prayers that seemingly go unanswered. It can grow sick in the waiting (Proverbs 13:12). Doubt can take root in the waiting. \n“How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.”\n– Luke 1:18\nWe know the rest of the story. Because of his doubt, Zechariah would “be silent and unable to speak until the day” his son was born (Luke 1: 20). This was not punishment for his unbelief, but rather, discipline from a loving Father (Proverbs 3:12). In Zechariah’s silence, God tended to his heart. And when the silence was over, Zechariah’s first words were a song of blessing unto the Lord (Luke 1:64, 67-80).\nPerhaps the priest who’d served the Lord faithfully his entire life still had one small piece of his heart closed off from his Maker. And because God loves His children, He is jealous for every part of our hearts, that not one piece of us would stay separated from His presence. That’s why He sent us His Son. \nThe world that lay waiting—for new life, for irrevocable hope—would soon receive the ultimate answer to all her prayers.\n\nKara Gause is an editor for She Reads Truth happily residing in Nashville, Tennessee.

Write the cards! Sing the carols! Wrap the gifts! Bake the cookies! Ring the bells! See the people! Read the stories! Smell the smells! Feel the feelings! Use all the exclamation points! Repeat! \nReality: Have you ever seen The Best Christmas Pageant Ever? Where the Herdman children attend church for the snacks? And the girl who plays Mary almost burns the church down with her cigarette? And the children think Christmas is a story about spies? These should have been my expectations. \nI don’t know about you, but from where I stand, all is not calm, nor is it bright. Sung more accurately, I would choose: “all is confusing, all is broken.” Anyone else? Praise the Lord that Christmas cheer is not the gospel. \nThings were not calm or bright for Mary, either. In fact, when the angel Gabriel appeared, Scripture tells us she was greatly troubled (Luke 1:29). She’d expected to live a quiet, humble life with her soon-to-be husband, Joseph, but the news about her reality changed everything. \nGabriel said, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”\n– Luke 1:30-33\nTo the world, all would not have appeared calm nor bright, yet Mary was pregnant with hope. Gabriel’s news confirmed to her that the God she believed in was real—Hope incarnate was being knit together within her.\nThe same is true for us, isn’t it? The annunciation is a reminder that what we hope for is true and with us. He is Immanuel (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23). It declares the surety of our expectations and confidence in our reality. \nMary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?”\n– Luke 1:34\nI think this is my favorite thing Mary ever says. She shows the natural human doubt that comes so easily to us: “How can this be, since I am ______?” You and I could insert a million things here—all the reasons we find to doubt God’s plans for us—couldn’t we? \nGod loves to birth hope from the impossible. This is the Truth that lies in a manger. The angel’s response to Mary’s doubt points her to the answer: It’s not up to her. It’s not up to us. \n“The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.”\n– Luke 1:35\nFriends, all may not be calm or bright in our broken world, but all is His. May Christ overshadow our expectations and understanding with His presence. May we hear and receive the same good news delivered to Mary: Hope is born within us through Christ. Hallelujah. \n",

Suddenly in South Carolina, the only label that seemed to matter was that I was “new.” I wouldn’t be elected to any student council positions or honor societies. I wouldn’t be captain of any team sports. My entire identity—everything I’d planned to put on my resume for college—had disappeared. \nMary experienced a similar loss when an angel appeared to her in Nazareth.The first thing we learn about Mary is that she is a virgin, which makes sense. In Mary’s time, the primary indicator of a woman’s worth was her virginity. If you were a virgin, you were valuable. If you gave away your virginity, well, you forfeited everything you had to offer, and you no longer had value to your family or the world around you. \nTo Mary, this probably didn’t feel like oppression. To Mary, it probably felt like she had played by the rules. She had a good life, a good reputation. She was about to be married to a man from a good family, with a good job as a carpenter. Being a virgin wasn’t just a state of Mary’s anatomy or past experience; it was her whole identity. \nThen God showed up. The angel of the Lord said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God” (Luke 1:30). The angel then described what would happen next: she would conceive a son. She would name Him Jesus and He would be great—a King, enthroned forever. Naturally, Mary would have interpreted everything the angel said through the lens of her own identity. That’s why the first question out of her mouth was about her virginity: “How will this happen since I have not been intimate with a man?” (Luke 1:34). She feared the answer she was about to hear. Her Son would be great, but in the eyes of the world, she no longer would be. \nSometimes God strips away our worldly identities in the process of giving us heavenly ones. Mary became mother to Mercy, and womb to the Way, the Truth and the Life. That the world might shun her, shame her, or disregard her didn’t change the fact that God called her highly favored (Luke 1:28). In Christ, we’re favored too (Ephesians 1:3).\nTrusting God with my identity means remembering His faithfulness throughout all generations, and being so confident in His love and favor that I am willing to lose what I call valuable in exchange for what He calls good. At sixteen, He took my obsession with leadership and replaced it with an awareness of my need for friendship. At twenty-nine, God is using my infertility to breathe new life into my relationships, friendships, and marriage. Anything is possible with God. The world may value its labels, but God does different math. \nPerhaps, like Mary, you are in a season where God is taking away one identity to give you a new one. Would you dare trust him to do the math of value in your life? Would you dare to hear Him whisper your name? \nOver time, as she saw the Lord working, Mary’s confusion turned to worship. “He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name,” she sang (Luke 1:49). May God also draw from us a response of praise as we wait expectantly for Him.\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Luke 1:57-66\nI always cry at baby showers. It doesn’t matter how many I attend, how many ultrasound pictures I look at, or how many tiny onesies I see unwrapped—I just can’t get over the wonder of it all. \nI had the joy of delivering three babies into this world in short succession, but I never got used to it. I was as overjoyed to see the profile of baby number three as I had been with his older brothers. It felt like falling in love for the first time, every time. \nIt’s a thread that unites all seven billion of us currently on the planet and every human being who has come before us or will arrive after we’re gone: each of our births is remarkably similar and yet, still remarkable. G.K. Chesterton once said it this way: “The most extraordinary thing in the world is an ordinary man and an ordinary woman and their ordinary children.”\nThis was true of Zechariah, Elizabeth, and their son, who would grow into the man we’ve come to know as John “the Baptist” (Luke 1:57-66). It was certainly true of Joseph, Mary, and the baby lying in a manger. The gospel makes it true of us too. Jesus’ work for us, and in us, is what transforms our unremarkable stories into something truly special.\nJohn was the only child of Zechariah and Elizabeth, a couple who’d spent decades barren and childless. Perhaps they’d given up hope of ever attending a shower for their own baby since the Bible tells us they were “advanced in years” (Luke 1:7). News that a baby was on the way was first announced only to Zechariah, in the privacy of the temple, by the angel Gabriel (vv. 8-19). And while that birth announcement was extraordinary, much of their story was very… ordinary.\nIt was one man plus one woman, giving birth to one child who would live and breathe and function much like every other person on the planet. But John’s birth also more; it was a foretaste, a flashing neon sign that pointed toward another ordinary, yet extraordinary, birth. \nHe didn’t remain a baby, of course. John spent his life looking toward Jesus and declaring:\n“Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!”\n– John 1:29\nStamp that on your Christmas card. Hang it as a banner around your tree. John was declaring the true meaning of Christmas.\nThe gospel is the most remarkable story every told, yet the binding of the story is stitched together with ordinary details. One man and one woman beaming over one child—the child—who would take away the sins of the world.\nThrough our ordinary, everyday lives we get to proclaim the extraordinary gospel. Just like our births were unremarkably remarkable, each one of us is a sinner in desperate need of a Savior. His grace is available to each of us, and yet, it never gets used up, never gets old, never loses its shine.\nThe gospel never stops transforming ordinary men and women into extraordinary examples of God’s goodness and grace. May it never cease to take our breath away. As Christmas comes and goes, and we gaze at Christ on both extravagant days and ordinary ones, may it feel like falling in love for the first time, every time.\n\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Luke 1:67-80\nFour hundred years. \nThat’s the length of time between the end of the Old Testament and the beginning of the New Testament. More importantly, it’s the length of time Israel existed without a prophet. That’s how long God’s people waited for a word from the Lord. Four hundred years of waiting, wondering, doubting, and fearing. Four hundred years of questioning whether God would ever speak again. Was it possible He had abandoned Israel once and for all? \nThe centuries leading up to Jesus’ birth are sometimes referred to as the “400 Years of Silence,” and it’s a silence Israel would have felt. It’s also the context of Luke’s story. In this opening chapter, he picks up where the last prophets left off, and a chasm of quiet hangs between. The silence is palpable, which is why Zechariah’s silence prior to this passage is no coincidence at all. \nAn angel of the Lord foretells the birth of Zechariah’s son, John, who would prepare the way for Christ. It was good and wonderful news, but Zechariah doubted. He was old, and so was his wife, and he questioned the power of God. As a consequence of this doubting, the angel sentenced Zechariah to months of silence. Only after John’s birth would Zechariah finally regain his voice.\nBut Zechariah doesn’t merely start talking again. He doesn’t exhale a muted “Finally!” and then return to life as usual. Instead, Zechariah’s voice returns like a trumpet blast. He bursts into praise, and foretells a plan more marvelous and magnificent than anyone had ever imagined.\nThe story of Zechariah seems like only a footnote in the larger story of Jesus, but we cannot miss the significance of it. Zechariah’s life is a signpost; both his silence and his singing foreshadow the arc of God’s story. God was about to end the four hundred years of silence with a roar of hope. God was putting an end to the era of no words by sending the Word made flesh.   \nThat is God’s calling card. He punctuates silence with singing because He always ends oppression with deliverance. After all, this wasn’t the first time the Israelites had endured centuries of silence. The span of time between Genesis and Exodus was roughly four hundred years as well. The Israelites suffered under years of slavery and oppression, but the story ended the same: God sent a deliverer (Exodus 3).\nThis is God’s pattern. He always shows up. He always saves. We see it in Moses, we see it in Jesus, and we even see it in the life of Zechariah. God is an always-returning God. He is always coming back, and that is never not true, no matter how thick the silence. \nKnowing this pattern, we are left with only one question: What will we do in the silence? \nZechariah could have become bitter. He could have nurtured his pride, he could have rebelled against God, and he probably would have felt justified in doing so. But he didn’t. Instead, Zechariah allowed God to change his heart, transforming him into an entirely different man than he was before. \nThat is the beauty of Zechariah’s story. His life is the story of Christmas writ small. He sings the song of a people delivered from slavery, a people walking in darkness who have seen a great light. His song is the hope of Jesus’ birth, a hope rooted in the promise that the silence will end, the darkness will abate, and Christ is coming back. \nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, and mom of two boys.

And now, right here in Luke 2, the prophet’s words are fulfilled:\n“For to us a child is born,\nto us a son is given;\nand the government shall be upon his shoulder,\nand his name shall be called\nWonderful Counselor, Mighty God,\nEverlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\nOf the increase of his government and of peace\nthere will be no end.”\n– Isaiah 9:6-7\nCaesar issued a decree. Everyone, the entire population of the world, was to return to his home and take part in the census. Joseph was of the lineage of David, echoing God’s promise that the Messiah would be delivered through that bloodline:\n“‘The days are coming’—this is the Lord’s declaration—\n‘when I will raise up a Righteous Branch of David.\nHe will reign wisely as king\nand administer justice and righteousness in the land.’”\n– Jeremiah 23:5\nSo to Bethlehem they came, Joseph and Mary. Their obedience to the law fulfilled the prophecy:\n“But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,\nwho are too little to be among the clans of Judah,\nfrom you shall come forth for me\none who is to be ruler in Israel,\nwhose coming forth is from of old,\nfrom ancient days.”\n– Micah 5:2\nIt was all ordained. Not one detail a coincidence. The words spoken so long ago come to life and piece themselves together in this passage. \nMary and Joseph arrive in Bethlehem and suddenly, it is time. What was once spoken of only in future tense—“his name shall be called…The days are coming…from you shall come forth”—is now present. \nJesus Christ is born. \nIsrael had not hoped in vain, nor had Mary believed in vain. The proof is in this newborn baby. Mary wraps Him carefully in cloth and places Him in a manger to sleep, for there is nowhere else for Him to rest. That is no matter, though. The couple has a Son. The Son. He is theirs, and He is ours, too—the hope for all mankind.  \nThere lies a life ahead for this child that will change the world forever. There will be miracles and disciples, parables and accusations, death and resurrection. But for now, this night, we simply gaze at His face and know. Jesus Christ, our hope, has come. \n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Luke 2:8-21\nTheirs was a thankless job, devoid of all glory.\nThey spent all their time in the fields, doing the dirty work of watching the flocks and keeping the sheep. Some of the lambs were special—set apart for sacrifice. And though the shepherds would keep those consecrated lambs safe and clean until their time came, the men themselves were considered perpetually unclean, unable to keep ceremonial law and unfit to be in the presence of the people, much less the priest. They lived on the margins, literally and figuratively.\nYou can imagine their surprise when the angel of the Lord appeared. And not just surprise, but terror. Surely this was bad news.\nBut the angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for look, I proclaim to you good news of great joy that will be for all the people: Today a Savior, who is Messiah the Lord, was born for you in the city of David. This will be the sign for you: You will find a baby wrapped snugly in cloth and lying in a feeding trough.”\n– Luke 2:10-12\nNo, this was not bad news. This was good news—life-changing, world-changing, eternity-changing news. A Savior had been born! For them. For the unclean, the outsider, the marginalized and misunderstood. \nThese men, so despised and distrusted in their culture that their testimony was not even admissible in a court of law, were called to bear first witness to the birth of Christ.\nThis was indeed good news for the shepherds. This is indeed good news for us.\nA Savior is born for you today. You, the sinner. You on the margins. You, the one who cannot bridge the gap between yourself and God. You, the forgotten, the heartbroken, the empty, the angry. You, who is incapable of producing true and lasting peace in your own heart. Christ is born for YOU.\nJohn describes it in his Gospel this way: “The Word became flesh and took up residence among us” (John 1:14). The phrase “took up residence” is the Greek word skēnoō, which means “tabernacled.” God was coming to live, to dwell, to “tabernacle” with His people. This is the same God with whom Moses pleaded, “Please, let me see Your glory.” And God replied, “You cannot see My face, for no one can see Me and live” (Exodus 33:18,20). This is why Moses built a tabernacle in the wilderness: so that God’s presence could dwell among the people without utterly consuming them.\nJohn continues, “We observed His glory, the glory as the One and Only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). Jesus Christ is the fullness of God’s glory made seeable, touchable, accessible to us. As pastor and theologian Tim Keller explains, “the un-scalable majesty of God and the transcendent holiness of God has become a baby.”\nThe fiery holiness of God is made flesh and has come to live—to make His holy dwelling place—here with us, the sinners He has come to save.\nAfter the angel of the Lord made his announcement to the shepherds that night, Luke tells us this happened:\n“Suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel, praising God and saying:\nGlory to God in the highest heaven,\nand peace on earth to people He favors!”\n– Luke 2:13-14\n“Host” here is the Greek word stratia, meaning “army.” An actual army of heavenly beings filled the sky, not to wage war but to proclaim peace. Peace in the hearts of men, women, and children, who make the Savior in a manger the Lord of their lives (John 14:27). Peace in the hearts of nations as they submit to the King of kings (Psalm 86:9).\nThe shepherds did not waste any time. Once they saw the Christ Child’s glory displayed in the song of the heavenly host, they went to Him. And when they saw the child Himself, swaddled in cloths like their sacrificial lambs, they worshiped (Luke 2:15,20).\nLet’s follow the shepherds to the manger today.\nMay our hearts pause to hear the worship of the heavenly host as they declare the good news. May we run to the Savior, the Lamb of God, who wrapped Himself in flesh and made His tabernacle among us. And may our response be worship, this Christmas Day and every day.\nFall on your knees!\nO hear the angel voices!\nO night divine, O night when Christ was born!\n \n",

Even with His earthly royal lineage, the King of kings was born in a stable far from home. Paul tells the Church He existed “in the form of God, did not consider equality with God as something to be used for His own advantage.” \nThe Prince of Peace made Himself low. He made Himself poor—a servant.\nIn fact, “He emptied Himself by assuming the form of a slave, taking on the likeness of men” (Philippians 2:6-7). The already-King of kings gave Himself to be born to a woman, to be helpless and often homeless so He could redeem us once and for all.\nWe’ve always needed a Savior. From the time Adam and Eve chose their way over God’s way in the Garden of Eden, to this moment of Advent anticipation. The tale is as old as time itself, but this true rescue story also stretches to all eternity. \nJoin us this Advent season—this season of arrival—as we watch the people of the Old Testament ache for an already-coming King. Let us, the weary world, rejoice in the arrival that is worth more than all the bells and whistles, all the magnolia garlands and candlelight vigils, all the quiet pauses and whispered thank-yous. \nLet’s enter into the anticipation and celebration, remembering our need, repenting of our sin, and rejoicing in the “already” of Jesus’ birth and the “not yet” of all it means for eternity. \n“So that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow—\nof those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth—\nand every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is  Lord,\nto the glory of God the Father.”\nPhilippians 2:10-11\n.  .  .  .\nOne way we make room for the coming King is by storing His Word in our hearts.

And it’s even wilder to realize that before “In the beginning God created…” (Genesis 1:1) ever happened, “Surely I am coming soon,” (Revelation 22:20) had already been set into motion.\n“In the beginning was the Word.”\nJohn 1:1\nThe Word was Jesus—He was God and He was with God in the beginning. Jesus was never Plan B. He was always Plan A. Jesus is, as Sally Lloyd-Jones says, “the piece that makes all the other pieces fit together.”\nAll of Scripture points to Jesus. Every word.\nWhile the whole of the Old Testament world groaned under the weight of its own imperfection—unfaithful, unbelieving, and incomplete—we, the Church, now see with clearer eyes that “all the promises of God find their ‘Yes’ in Christ” (2 Corinthians 1:20). The world would always be incomplete without Jesus.\nAnd so, beginning with Adam, we will spend the first three weeks of Advent studying the Scriptures together to find Jesus in the Old Testament. We will seek to understand in a fresh and clearer way how, while many men and women were mere models of the already-coming One, Jesus would be the truest and best version of every one of them. He would be complete where they were incomplete. God’s promises to these prophets, priests, and kings would indeed find their “yes” in Jesus. \nJust look at the parallels and important differences we see with Jesus and the very first man:\n-Adam was from the earth, a man of dust (Genesis 2:7).\n-Jesus is from Heaven, not of this world (1 Corinthians 15:47).\n-Adam lived in his true home—a garden in the east of Eden (Genesis 2:8). He was not a stranger. Not an alien. His home was not temporary—until his sin made things wrong.\n-Jesus left His true home in Heaven to become a stranger in a foreign land in order to make things right again (John 3:16).\n-Adam was tested in the Garden of Eden and disobeyed. His disobedience introduced death and condemnation to the entire world (Romans 5:15).\n-Jesus, too, faced a decision in a garden—in Gethsemane. His obedience unto death introduced grace and life to those who receive it (Matthew 26:36-39).\n-When Adam disobeyed, God made him leave his home. He would never get to go back ever again (Genesis 3:23-24).\n-When Jesus obeyed and fulfilled His work, He ascended into Heaven to return to His home with the Father for eternity, and to prepare a place for us there (John 14:2, Acts 1:11).\n-Sin and death entered the world through Adam by one act. Now everyone dies because everyone sins (Romans 5:17).\n-Life-giving justification, was made available by Jesus through one truly righteous act because He was the One righteous man (Romans 5:18).\nDo you see? If Jesus was “foreknown before the foundation of the world,” even the very first man was an on-purpose prototype of the One who was already coming. \nMany of us celebrate these four weeks of Advent leading up to Christmas because we are remembering the awaited arrival of our King. But the Old Testament is, in a sense, the first Advent. It was a thousands-of-years-long season, where the weary world awaited the very real, truest and best “thrill of hope” we sing about today. \nJesus is the true and better Adam—the One whose obedience brought forgiveness and life where disobedience once brought condemnation and death. Let’s study the Scriptures together this season to see that we can find our “Yes!” to every one of God’s promises in Christ Jesus. Amen.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Genesis 4:1-16, Romans 3:21-26, Ephesians 2:13\nThe imagery of sacrifice is all around us.\nWith the passing of a new season, we watch as death makes way for new life. In winter, the earth dries up and lies dormant in order for spring to birth vibrant greens and all the colors of life in bloom. Even the daily bread we eat is from wheat that has been plucked from the ground, crushed, and made into flour for our life’s sustenance. Out my window in downtown Nashville I see an old office building, vacated long ago, being torn down to create space for something newer and shinier—something people can occupy once again.\nThe first image of sacrifice in Scripture shows up in Genesis 4, the tragic story of the brothers Cain and Abel. Both make offerings to God. Cain brought Him produce, and Abel brought Him the firstborn of his flock. God is pleased with Abel but not with Cain, not because Abel’s gift was better, but because Cain’s heart was not pure.\nGod’s favor lies with Abel, and Cain’s response is “furious” and “despondent” (Genesis 4:5). This leads him to murder his brother in the field, Abel’s blood crying out from the ground to God in condemnation of Cain’s act (Genesis 4:10).\nAn innocent man dies as a consequence of his brother’s sin.\nSound familiar?\nIn Romans, Paul writes about someone else’s sin: yours and mine. “There is no one righteous,” he says, “not even one… All have turned away” (Romans 3:10,12). Then in verse 21, just when it seems all is lost for humanity, Paul writes two incredibly beautiful words:\n“But now…”\nThe “but now” is hope. The “but now” is the beginning of our new story, as winter is to spring and as grain is to bread. We were sinners who turned away and were called unrighteous, but now we are “justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Romans 3:26).\nIn Romans 3, we learn what Jesus’ sacrifice meant for us and means for us still. It can be summed up in three simple yet rich words: justification, redemption and propitiation.\n Justification means we have been made righteous under the covering of Christ: “They are justified freely by His grace…” (v. 24).\nRedemption means we have been purchased by Christ and, therefore, are now free. “…through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (v. 24).\nPropitiation means God’s wrath toward sin has been satisfied by the sacrifice of Christ. “God presented Him as a propitiation through faith in His blood to demonstrate His righteousness” (v. 25).\nAbel’s death did not accomplish these things. He was innocent, but he was not without sin. He died, but he did not lay down his life for another. His blood cried out injustice and condemnation for his brother, Cain.\nJesus is the true and better Abel. He was not merely innocent; He was sinless. His life was not taken from Him; He gave it willingly. His blood cries out in satisfaction of justice and for our justification. Christ’s pure sacrifice accomplished what no other could—the full and forever forgiveness of our sin.\nThe hard earth of winter, the grinding of wheat, the rubble of an old building strewn on the ground—these symbols of sacrifice in our everyday lives are there for a reason. They are a constant living and dying reminder of Christ’s sacrifice, of His blood that bought and brought us new life. They remind us of our freedom. They tell us we are forgiven.\nThe sacrifice is done. The price? It’s been paid. And it’s all—and always will be—because of Jesus.\n\n",

Perhaps you’ve experienced life-altering decisions like this, too.\nWhat I’ve learned over the years is that God rarely calls us to comfort and convenience but instead to a life of faith and trust. Such is the story of Abraham and God’s everlasting promises to him and his descendants. It is a covenant deeply woven into the fabric of the Advent story.\nWhen we meet Abram, before God changes his name to Abraham, he is living in the land of his people, where he has been for 70 years. But God appeared to Abram with instructions to leave—in faith—the comfort and safety of this familiar life. God promised to make Abram’s name great. The man who had yet to become a father would now father a great new nation—a nation marked by mercy and grace, a living illustration of the forgiveness and love of an everlasting God. \nAll that was required of Abram was to obey in faith.\nOf all the promises God made to Abram, one was key: a son. The long-awaited promised son to an older barren woman and her faithful husband would become the seed of a family tree through which Jesus Christ was born to save all humanity. The first promised son was a foreshadowing of the second, when God would come to earth in flesh and blood to redeem mankind’s past, present, and future sins for a new beginning. Two baby boys, born 2000 years apart, would change the world.\nThat second baby boy, Jesus Christ, was the true and better Abraham. He, too, left the comfort and safety of His home with His Father. While Abraham’s obedience led generations to the Promised Land, Jesus’s obedience fulfilled the whole of God’s covenant of love to His people, so that we who have faith are also “Abraham’s sons,” heirs to the promise (Galatians 3:6-7). Like Abraham, we are invited to have faith not only in what we cannot see, but also in what has already been secured for us by our good and sovereign Father. \nGod’s sovereignty over Abraham’s story illuminates the ultimate love God has for us. Jesus is the Son of promise, and all of God’s promises to us are made possible through Him (2 Corinthians 1:20). New beginnings tell the story of grace, mercy, and forgiveness—gifts from a loving Father who is worthy of our faith, even when we cannot see what lies ahead.\nWhere is God calling us to new beginnings? Will we remain in the familiar or step out in faith?\nMay we obey His calling and trust that He will fill us with strength and courage, grace and peace, hope and joy—everything we need for life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3). These were the gifts given to Abraham, and they are the Advent gifts freely given to us through Jesus Christ.\n",

Extending my good arm, I dangled the little black plastic hook just far enough to catch the runner of a beautiful antique toboggan. Oh yes! I am the Christmas Queen! I hoisted it triumphantly out of the dumpster and held the sled up for my embarrassed husband to admire. “There’s nothing wrong with this! We can give it fresh paint and use it to decorate for Christmas! Christmas is saved!” \nI started to cast my eyes around for other delights and leaned even further over the edge. I had never been to our local country dump before, and I was making up for lost time. I spotted another rotting sled and prepared to go in after it when I heard a loud voice: “Ma’am, please get out of the dumpster. You cannot remove trash from this dump.”\nYeah. I hear it now, too. I was climbing in a dumpster. I had to be scolded by another adult. It’s probably his job to keep enthusiasts like me from climbing over the metal sides to root through other people’s castoffs. When we wake up in the morning, we don’t plan to put our hands in the garbage. But then something shiny sitting in the middle of the refuse catches our greedy eyes, and we dive in head first.\nWhen Melchizedek came to visit Abraham, our guy Abraham dropped everything and gave him ten percent of his wealth. He saw that Melchizedek was a faithful priest of the one true God—a truly rare thing in those days. But the king of Sodom was there, too, and did he care that the extraordinary prophet, priest, and king of the Old Testament had come to visit? Hard no. He couldn’t see the big picture.\nThe king of Sodom was focused on the grabby, shiny business of splitting up land with Abraham. He didn’t even speak to Melchizedek. He was caught up in the petty details of arguing with Abraham, but the important thing that day was the meeting with Melchizedek, the mysterious priest-king. \nMelchizedek was a big deal! At this meeting, it’s clear that he is greater than Abraham, and Abraham is, well, he’s “Father Abraham,” the father of the faith in so many ways. Even Abraham pays Melchizedek homage. The writer of Hebrews describes Melchizedek as being “without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life”—a truly unique figure (Hebrews 7:3). \nThis rare combination foreshadows Jesus, who is the true eternal priest-king (Psalm 110:4, Hebrews 7:3; 16:20). Jesus is the truer and better Melchizedek who fulfills both our need for a priest and for a king (Genesis 14:18, 21). Jesus is actually called “a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek” (Hebrews 7:17).\nWhen Melchizedek sat with Abraham, he served the kingly and covenantal meal of bread and wine, just as Jesus would later do for His disciples (Matthew 26:26-28). While the meal and blessings Melchizedek offered Abraham were a welcome refreshment, Jesus is the only source of true fulfillment and blessing.\nWhen we, like the king of Sodom, find ourselves focusing on the wrong thing—digging in the garbage for our treasure—we can remember that the wonder of the ages is right in front of us. The gospel is true! Instead of giving ourselves over to the sparkles and twinkles of distraction, let us see “the hope that is set before us” which is Christ the Lord (Hebrews 6:18). Thanks be to God!\n\n \n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Vivian Mabuni\n\nText: Genesis 22:1-22, John 3:16-17, 1 John 4:7-9\nI sat with arms folded in the back row, watching as the speaker stood in the front of the room. His voice rose with intensity as his fingers flipped through the translucent pages of his Bible, which opened from the left, the verses printed top to bottom and right to left. I couldn’t understand a word he said. Then a silent hush came over the room as he stopped speaking,   his eyes scanning the room of Japanese college students. I looked down at my folded arms to avoid eye contact. In the silent space of that moment I understood perfectly the question God had impressed on my heart:\n“Are you willing to sell your house in Southern California, uproot the kids from their friends and schools to move to another continent, learn the language, and serve Me here if I say so?”\nAfter a month immersed in the culture, our summer mission team still had another two weeks before returning home. In the coming days, I walked the streets of Japan, wrestling long and hard with those questions and wondering: would I be willing to sacrifice the things I held most dear if the Lord asked me to?\nWhat I love most about today’s reading from Genesis is the painfully beautiful dance of love, surrender, and trust displayed in Abraham and Isaac. Abraham’s son was a miracle—a living and breathing, walking and talking impossibility. Isaac was a tangible, daily reminder to Abraham of God’s faithfulness, perfect provision, and ultimate sovereignty. Still, after making good on His covenant promise, God asked Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, the son he loved. In faith, Abraham obeyed, thinking God would somehow raise Isaac from the dead (Hebrews 11:17-19).\nAbraham surrendered to God, and Isaac did as well. As a strong young man, he likely could have overpowered his older, frail father, but he allowed Abraham to tie him down and watched as his loving father lifted his knife to kill him as the burnt offering. Isaac loved and trusted both his father, Abraham, and his God, Yahweh.\nJesus, too, could have sought to preserve His life by leaving His sleeping friends in the garden and running away to a distant country. But instead, He wrestled and finally surrendered, praying, “not My will, but Yours, be done” (Luke 22:42).\nBoth Isaac and Jesus demonstrated trust in their fathers. Both knew they could rest secure in God the Father’s hands because they were deeply loved by Him. When Abraham demonstrated his love for God by offering up his only son, God spared the son and provided the sacrifice. But, because of His great love for you and me, God did not spare His only Son. Jesus is the true and better Isaac—the perfect sacrifice—lovingly offered by both the Father and the Son. \nThe near-sacrifice of Isaac points to the ultimate sacrifice given of pure love and unbounded mercy. And that, dear friends, is the underlying message of Advent: God loves you.\nGOD loves you.\nGod LOVES you.\nGod loves YOU.\nNo sacrifice we make, no matter how dear, will ever trump the sacrifice made on the cross by our Savior. Our response to this great love is to simply give ourselves, to offer up our lives as a living and holy sacrifice (Romans 12:1-2). We will come to this crossroads of trust over and over, but in the midst of the unknown—the unanswered questions, the bewildering circumstances—we can safely surrender and rest in God’s great love.\n  “We are often hindered from giving up our treasures to the Lord out of fear for their safety. This is especially true when those treasures are loved relatives and friends. But we need have no such fears. Our Lord came not to destroy but to save. Everything is safe which we commit to Him, and nothing is really safe which is not so committed.”\n—A.W. Tozer, The Pursuit of God\n \n \n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Missy Fuller\n\nText: Genesis 32:22-32, Isaiah 53:5, Hebrews 12:5-11\nI reached for my phone. The screen came to life, illuminating the dark room. It was 2:17 AM, and my mind was racing. As I turned over I felt the Spirit’s prompting. So, instead of reaching for the bottle of melatonin, I reached for my Bible and journal.\nI needed to wrestle. Earlier that day, I had been on a date that left me confused and restless. My heart wanted one thing and my head wanted another. Or maybe it was my sinful insecurities convincing me of my want while the Spirit of God in me reminded me of what I already knew to be true. Was I going to choose what I deeply desired, which was now right in front of me, or was I going to humble myself and wait for God’s best? Regardless, I needed to struggle with my Lord.\nJacob, too, was alone with God that night at the Jabbok River. He wrestled with a man, struggling until daybreak. As the sun rose, Jacob asked for a blessing before he would let the man go (Genesis 32:24-26). But he received more than a simple blessing. Jacob—whose name meant “he grasps the heel,” a Hebrew idiom for “he deceives”—was renamed. He was given the name Israel “because he struggled with God and with men and prevailed” (Genesis 32:28).\nCenturies later, one of Jacob’s descendants had His own midnight encounter with the Father. The night before His crucifixion, Jesus struggled with God in the Garden of Gethsemane. He pleaded with the Father to spare Him from the suffering He was about to endure. Yet, even in His great anguish, He humbled Himself before the Father and uttered these remarkable words of surrender:\n“…not my will, but Yours, be done.”\n– Luke 22:42\nBoth Jesus and Jacob struggled with God, and both were wounded.\nBoth presented requests to the Father. Jacob demanded a blessing, and God granted his request. Jesus, in humility, asked the Father to remove His suffering, but yielded to God’s greater purpose.\nBoth struggles birthed a new identity. Jacob received a new identity in his new name. Jesus allowed the blessing of a new identity to fall to us.\nThrough Jesus’s sacrifice, we are granted redemption. He took the wounds we deserve, and we receive the blessing that was rightfully His. Christ overcame for us, and we are renamed “Redeemed.”\nOur struggles become defining moments in our lives. In Christ, even the struggle becomes a blessing because it draws us closer to our Savior. Jesus is the true and better Jacob, wrestling with God and sustaining the blow that was due us, so that we might receive the blessing of grace.\n“But he was pierced for our transgressions,\nhe was crushed for our iniquities;\nthe punishment that brought us peace was on him,\nand by his wounds we are healed.”\n– Isaiah 53:5\nOh, dear sisters, I pray we would struggle, too. I pray we would find comfort as we wrestle with our Lord and hold on for the blessing that is ours in Christ Jesus. Let us wrestle with the One who has overcome the greatest struggle of all, and all for us.\n\n",

No, I’ve never been personally attacked by one, nor can I explain exactly why these life-size chestnut-chomping soldiers are terrifying, but I can tell you that I’d much rather chestnuts stay roasting on an open fire.\nNutcrackers are about halfway down on my list of fears, accompanied by wild turkeys, elevators, prepackaged deli meat, team-building activities, ostriches, people who think it’s okay to ride ostriches, and Kermit the frog (especially when he plays Tiny Tim in “A Muppets’ Christmas Carol.”)\nI am painfully aware that most of these things are benign and will never hurt me, but I still bubble wrap my days in fear, naming my enemies one by one; some silly, some serious. At the core of each is something that resembles rejection, death, loss, failure, abandonment and hopelessness. My fear doesn’t just vanish at will, especially because I know, at some point or another, I will experience pain (John 16:33).   \nRemember how, in Genesis 2, God gives Adam the assignment of naming the animals? What a task! I don’t know what Adam’s process was like, but if he was anything like me, he must have been a little overwhelmed to name the vast variety of animals, many of which he had never even encountered. He probably had to do the best he could with what little information he had, naming one based on its high jump, another on its orange color. We can surmise that regardless of the names Adam chose, God already had one for them: good. \nAlthough I wasn’t in the garden that day, I still inherently name things based on the little information I’m given. When tragedy roars or grief screeches, I heap hopeless names onto myself, my circumstances, and God.\nBut maybe God doesn’t have a name for each individual event that happens to us. He just calls it all good (Romans 8:28). Nothing in God’s will is isolated from the abundance He intends for us. \nAs noted by the gift of his technicolor dreamcoat, Joseph was a beloved son with a strange prophetic dream his family didn’t believe. His brothers probably named the dream as bad, confusing, and potentially threatening, so they sold their brother to avoid the consequences. Little did they know that even after their betrayal, he was sent “ahead of them to preserve life” and would inevitably save their family lineage (Genesis 45:7). What his brothers intended for evil, God, in His infinite mercy and power, willed for good (Genesis 50:20).\nThis brings us to the story of another beloved Son: Jesus. Like Joseph, no one believed Jesus was a King, and they resisted His rule through intense disbelief and ultimate betrayal on the Cross.\nWhat names do you think Jesus’ crucifiers called the events that unfolded? They probably had several words for it, but because God’s intention for the gospel is to turn everything right side up, the best place to see its full effect is in the people who hated Jesus the most.\nWhen we overrule God’s given good with our own seemingly better ways, our lack of trust is no different than that of Jesus’ enemies. Ouch. Our eyes become so preoccupied with the how’s, why’s and what-if’s that we miss seeing the One who has gone before us to preserve life (Genesis 45:7). Jesus’ crucifiers missed out on this, too, clutching their fears with doubtful hands.\nBut when we embrace this truth, we also get to receive this good news: Jesus is the true and better Joseph because He came to reverse the stories of ALL the brothers and sisters who rejected Him, including you and me.\nIn the ultimate reversal of death to life on the cross, Christ wills even our filthy hearts for good.\nBecause He walked through our greatest fear for us, all others are joyfully overturned into His perfect will.\n“For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, then how much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by His life!”\n-Romans 5:10 \nHe calls us by name (Isaiah 43:1), and only because of Jesus—the only One whose birth name was “Good”—we, too, find ourselves, our fears and our days with brand new name tags.\nPraise be to God!\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Exodus 12:1-28, John 1:29, 1 Peter 1:18-19, 1 Corinthians 5:7-8\nA couple of years ago, I visited Israel. It was April and by the time my group arrived in Jerusalem, preparation for Passover was in full swing. You couldn’t find a loaf of leavened bread anywhere. Hotels were hustling to get things just right for the guests who would soon arrive, and locals were taking off to resorts. (Apparently Passover is also a popular week to vacation in Israel.)\nIt was pretty incredible to be in the Holy City at around the same time of year that Jesus would have arrived in Jerusalem for His final Passover, for the final Passover.\nOn the way there, I sat by a guy on the plane who had been born and raised in Jerusalem. He told me that his parents liked to host visitors in their home to serve religious meals on Sabbath and Passover and teach them the history of the rituals.\nI imagine for the seder, the meal eaten on the first night of Passover, they would explain the passage in Exodus 12 we read today. The unleavened bread. The slaughter of the lamb. They would explain what the blood meant and how their ancestors, so many years ago, were saved by that blood painted over their doors. By God’s grace, the angel of death passed over them (Exodus 12:13).\nBecause so many Christians make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, my friend on the plane said most of the guests his parents host are believers. I thought that was interesting. How differently a Christian must experience a Passover meal compared to an Orthodox Jew. The two may be eating and drinking the very same thing, but they are likely thinking and feeling something completely different. One celebrates the night of the first Passover when the blood of the lamb saved the lives of Israel’s firstborn sons. The other celebrates the night of the last Passover when the blood of the Lamb made the final atonement for our sin so we can be saved, eternally (1 Corinthians 5:7).\nAlthough Christ’s sacrifice is the event of Christianity—the foundational truth that establishes it as a faith and sets us apart as Christ followers—I almost daily lose sight of its significance. I rarely follow the instruction Paul gives to the Corinthians, to live a life that “observes the feast” (1 Corinthians 5:8).\nMore often than not, I live under the weight of my own sin, as if Christ’s sacrifice isn’t enough to cover my own transgressions. I look around frantically for solutions to fix what I have broken, but overcorrecting only leads me to legalism—the opposite of freedom in Christ. This is why I love the reminder Peter gives about the assurance of our salvation: \nFor you know that you were redeemed from your empty way of life inherited from the fathers, not with perishable things like silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without defect or blemish.\n-1 Peter 1:18-19\nThe blood of the Lamb is not perishable. What a promise! Our salvation in Christ does not have an expiration date. It was a one-time-deal, a forever-atoned exchange that means we are forever accepted. Because of Jesus, the true and better Passover Lamb, we now live free, the chains of sin eternally broken.\nI wish we could all sit at a table together and partake of the seder meal. But since we can’t, let’s imagine it. Let’s virtually raise our glasses and promise each other that today we will keep the feast, even as we anticipate the wedding supper of the Lamb that is yet to come (Revelation 19:9).\n\n",

Actually, it began before that. Remember all that mediating Moses had to do between God and Pharaoh to get the Israelites safely out of slavery in the first place? That’s a lot of sweaty-armpit visits to the palace, you guys. \nOnce the miracles of the plagues finally motivated Pharaoh to let them go, it still took Moses a lot of affirming and convincing the people of Israel to get them to lean into their escape. While the chariots of Egypt were in hot pursuit of the runaway slaves, Moses reminded Israel, “Don’t be afraid. Stand firm and see the LORD’s salvation He will provide for you today; for the Egyptians you see today, you will never see again” (Exodus 14:33).\nMoses spent his life in mediations. Remember Exodus 19, when he played the telephone game between God and Israel at the base of Mt. Sinai? It was his job to ensure nobody got themselves killed while he received the Ten Commandments. There was a lot of back-and-forth. A lot of frustration. Not only did Moses represent God to His people, but he also found himself in the supremely awkward position of representing the people of Israel to their God. More sweaty armpits, for sure. \nMoses’ job was possibly more dangerous and more wonderful than any job of any human before him. (Well, I guess Noah had a pretty dangerous, wonderful job too, didn’t he?) Moses had the unique privilege and great holy fear of actually hearing God’s voice and needing to be protected from the too-awesome-ness of seeing His face. It really was risky work.  \nBut Moses loved God and he loved Israel. That’s what makes a good mediator, don’t you think—loving both parties and wanting them to love each other? Listen to the way Moses roots for Israel before God in Exodus 37:13: “Now consider that this nation is Your people.”\nMoses wanted God to forgive the startling greatness of “stiff-necked” Israel’s iniquity. He wanted God to go with Israel where they went, and for Israel to go where God was going. Moses gave his life to reminding God and Israel how much they loved each other. \nSound familiar? \nWe have a Moses, too, you know. The True and Better Moses. We have a Mediator who asks Yahweh to forgive the startling greatness of our sin. While Moses mediated an old covenant, the Ten Commandments, Jesus Christ fulfilled that old covenant and now mediates a new, better covenant between God and His (still “stiff-necked”) people (Hebrews 12:24).\nMoses was an archetype of a future Mediator, though in later years, he would grow impatient with God and Israel. He would disobey God’s instructions and overstep his role because the self-righteous glory of being their provider seemed more desirable than being their mediator (Numbers 20:6-12). The sin of a nation overwhelmed Moses to the point of disobedience and destruction, while the iniquity of the world moved Jesus to the point of obedience and restoration (Exodus 32:19, Philippians 2:8). \nToday we can thank God for sending Jesus as a true and better Mediator who, like Moses and other Old Testament priests, is our means of connection to the unimaginable glory of the Father.

All the plagues and the signs and the miracles, the pushing back of the Red Sea and the crushing of their Egyptian enemies—here in the desert and in the face of great physical hunger, they’d forgotten it all. \nThe Israelites had grown hungry and weary after two months of desert living. So much so, they questioned their freedom altogether. Were we brought out here just to die? Maybe that whole slavery thing wasn’t as bad as we remember it? (Exodus 16:3, my paraphrase).\nBut God didn’t intend for their time in the desert to be a death march. He’d rescued the Israelites from captivity to restore them to Himself. He drew them out from under the yoke of oppression to draw them back into relationship with Him, knowing that only in His presence would they ever experience true freedom.\nNot that they had any idea what to do with that freedom. They were now free to know and worship the one true God, but that didn’t mean they knew how (Ezekiel 20:7-8). In the meantime, did I mention they were hungry? \nAnd God was ready to provide! He said to Moses, “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you” (v. 4). But He was going to provide His way:\n“The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. This way I will test them to see whether or not they will follow my instructions. On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on the other days” (v. 4-5).\nThe Israelites had a need, and their desire to have it met wasn’t a bad thing. The problem was they were still living like slaves. With heads down and eyes trained to the ground, they set out to scavenge for food, hoarding it like orphans who had no idea when they would eat again. \nGod the Father wanted to provide for His children, but He also wanted them to know their Provider. He desired to commune with them, to have a meal with them, every day, and to teach them to trust Him. All the Israelites really wanted was the food.\nThere’s a similar scene in John 6, the day after Jesus feeds the 5,000. The crowd comes to find Him and, of course, He knows exactly why. “You are seeking me,” He says to them, “not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves” (John 6:26-27).\nThis crowd had just witnessed and experienced miracles. They had a need and Jesus had met it. Who wouldn’t want more of that? But now they wanted to make that manna rain again and on their own terms. They were so busy looking for the miracle, they forgot to stop and take notice of the One who’d performed it.\nI can almost hear the longing in Jesus’ voice when He asks them to consider ALL of what He came to give us:\n“I am the bread of life,” Jesus told them. “No one who comes to Me will ever be hungry, and no one who believes in Me will ever be thirsty again.”\n– John 6:35\nJesus is the bread of life, the true and better manna, rained down from heaven and in the flesh. He is God’s provision for a hungry and thirsty world. But we still forget all He’s done for us. \nI wonder if Jesus thought of the Israelites and that crowd of 5000 when He chose these words at His last meal with the disciples: “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this to remember me” (Luke 22:19, NLT). I wonder if He thought of you and me, and how we would indeed struggle to remember, even when His faithfulness has never failed us.\nFriends, we lack nothing in Christ Jesus. So let’s take and eat, taste and see. May we partake today, and know that Jesus will always be more than enough for all our tomorrows. \nThank you, Jesus, for Your perfect provision on the Cross. Please forgive us when we forget and please help us to remember. Teach us what it means to long for Your presence above all else and what it means to feast with You.

        "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Job 1:1-22, 1 Peter 2:21-25, 1 Peter 3:18 \nEvery Missouri farm girl like me knows what a cocklebur is, but since not every woman is a muck boots-wearin’, four-wheeler-ridin’ farmer, here’s a country girl crash course. Cockleburs are tiny, spiky black thistles that fuse themselves to you when you walk through the woods. They stick to your socks and boots, your pants and shirt, your dog and your children. Though not nearly as tasty, they work like nature’s taffy. The more you try to pull free of them, the more stuck you become. \nIt’s enough to make even the hillbilliest farm girl dream of life in the cocklebur-free big city. \nBut those little, spiky shells house a seed. The barbs cling to passersby and are spread far and wide. Sure, they inflict some minor “suffering” on their host, but it is not suffering without purpose. It is an ingenious method of perpetuating life. \nMy aversion to cockleburs is almost as strong as my aversion to the book of Job. It never gets easier to read. Here’s Job’s glowing resume:\n“[Job] was a man of perfect integrity, who feared God and turned away from evil… Job was the greatest man among all the people of the east.” \n– Job 1:1,3\nIf a good man is hard to find, Job was that anomaly. He deserved an award. Instead, he lost his children, his fortune, and his health—he lost everything. Not just a suffering servant, Job seems to be a senselessly suffering servant. \nIf someone like Job is going to endure so much, I want it to be a means to an end. The phrase “everything happens for a reason” is born out of our desperation to look into Job-like suffering and see purpose. We all want our suffering to mean something. We want other people’s suffering to mean something, too. It’s why we offer hollow platitudes in hospital rooms and funeral homes. We are all like Job’s friends, so desperate to find purpose in pain that we sometimes say stupid things. \nI want Job’s story to end with the creation of an organization or foundation that changed the world. I want to read that millions of people came to worship Job’s God for the first time because he suffered so well. But Job’s story doesn’t give us the happy ending we crave. Sure, the things he lost were restored, but we are left to wonder whether his suffering accomplished a higher purpose. The cockleburs that stuck to Job don’t deliver the meaning I want them to. \nBut Jesus is the true and better Job. \nJesus suffered more than I can wrap my human mind around. He was beaten, bloodied, humiliated, scorned, crucified, and killed (Matthew 27:27-31). Yes, Job was a righteous man, but he was ultimately a sinner, incapable of keeping God’s holy standards. Not Jesus. He never sinned, not once. And yet, He suffered unimaginably. Jesus’ sinlessness makes His suffering unbearable unless we look past the Cross to what it accomplished: \n“For Christ also suffered for sins once for all,\nthe righteous for the unrighteous,\nthat He might bring you to God,\nafter being put to death in the fleshly realm\nbut made alive in the spiritual realm.”\n– 1 Peter 3:18\nJob’s suffering was an answer to the Enemy’s accusation. Jesus suffered to silence the Accuser forever (Job 1:9-11, 1 Corinthians 15:55). Job was wounded, seemingly to no higher end. Jesus was pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our sins (Isaiah 53:5). The book of Job ends without an explanation for His suffering. Jesus’ life ended to fix creation’s biggest problem: sin. \nInfinitely more miraculous than a forest full of cockleburs, Christ’s work on the cross carried salvation across all time and for all who would repent and believe. Jesus’ suffering gave us life. His pain made a way for the redemptive ending I am so desperate for. \nJesus was a suffering servant, but not a servant who suffered senselessly. His unimaginable suffering was for our immeasurable relief.

I can think of at least one that ended in actual violence. I think we put a lot of pressure on ourselves and our families every year to make this Christmas PERFECT. Since perfection isn’t possible (and since our perfection isn’t the point of Christmas anyway), I often find myself disappointed on Christmas morning instead of grateful and merry.\nMy family is broken in so many big and small ways. And since my husband and I have tried our hand at parenting, we have further shattered our ideals of Christmas morning bliss. We are never enough, and our children can never get it quite right either.\nIsn’t it startling that even our Christmases are broken—the most joyful day of the year? We can’t hold it together for even that one day.\nWe, like Ruth, live in a world of brokenness. She was a Moabite and, therefore, foreign and out-of-place, widowed and alone, and supporting an aging mother-in-law.\nDo you feel foreign or out-of-place this Christmas? Boaz gave Ruth a home and a place. And Jesus gives us a home and a place.\nDo you feel alone? Boaz brought intimacy and companionship to Ruth. We as the Church get to be the “bride of Christ,” and Jesus brings us into closest, most intimate relationship we’ll ever know.\nDo you feel the weight of caring for children or parents? Boaz brought relief and help to Ruth. Jesus brings relief to the weary heart.\nAs it turns out, the point of Christmas isn’t to make it perfect. It’s that we deeply need Christ’s redemption, so that even the weary world can rejoice. Jesus sees our brokenness, and He comes to redeem us, bind up every wound, and wipe away every tear. Thanks be to God!\nBoaz was the kinsman redeemer for Ruth; he rescued and redeemed her life. But Jesus is the Kinsman Redeemer for all of us. When I read Ruth’s story, I am filled with a blushing joy for her. Her suffering ended like all fairytales end—with a wedding.\nAnd in Jesus, Ruth’s story is my own. All my suffering, my deflated Christmas mornings, and my deep loneliness are all leading to the end of my very real fairytale—the marriage supper of the Lamb.\nAnd that Christmas morning—as the completion of the first—will be everything I’ve ever dreamed of. At the marriage supper of the Lamb, we will sit with our Kinsman Redeemer, and there our hearts will be truly merry. \nMerry Christmas!\n\n",

Yet, each time I trudge exactly halfway up the steps, I’m reminded of all the projects I’ve dropped off to live inside those closet doors—partially-knitted blankets, unsent birthday cards, and neglected, splattered canvases.\nOnce upstairs, the quilt hanging reliably from my bedpost reminds me that my mother has no such closet in her house. She’d seen my eyes fill with hearts over a quilt in a favorite shop, but instead of directing me to the check-out line, she pointed to the fabric store. One by one, we chose the perfect shades of mustard, gray and navy, hoisting the patterned bolts of material into our shopping cart. When we returned home, I watched my mom lay out the measured pieces of fabric onto our large wooden table, where it would remain for weeks as she precisely snipped the proper dimensions, pinned the layers together, faithfully sewed each row and column, then bound the edges with care.\nAs I watched the scraps of fabric form into a unified expression of comfort, the committed hum of the sewing machine taught me everything I need to know about love. Our care for others drives us to tangibly prove our promises—our intentions are to hug, write, and make in the same fashion as our Maker!—but sometimes, our best efforts end up in neglected rooms and forgotten closets.\nDavid’s love motivated him to do something great; he was going to build a temple for God to dwell in (2 Samuel 7:2). He’d already given much victory to the people of Israel, so it seemed the next natural step was to do something to thank the God who’d cast out their enemies. A temple was the perfect choice.\nBut God had other ideas. He didn’t need a house, and He rejected David’s gift through the words of Nathan the prophet:\n“The Lord Himself will make a house for you. When your time comes and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up after you your descendant, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He will build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.”\n– 2 Samuel 7:11-13\nDavid thought the ultimate expression of love was to create God’s glory with his own hands. Instead, the biggest and best thing the King of Israel could do was to receive and behold God’s glory. \nGod promises David a house with a solid foundation to outlast his legacy of power, but the house isn’t made of bricks, wood or stone—it’s a covenant. Jesus is the temple David could never build. David receives more than his hands can hold: not just a home, a victory, or a powerful reign, but an eternal lineage hemmed by God’s promise (Jeremiah 23:5-6).\nIndeed, Jesus is the true and better David, the eternal King of all Kings who provides for us an eternal home with God the Father, secured by His own life, death, and resurrection. \nJust like Israel received David’s victory for themselves, you and I take up residence in the winnings of Christ. No longer do we find ourselves in a forgotten closet because we, too, get to dwell in the covenant of God’s kept promise.\nMay we be reminded of the covering of Christ, resting peacefully under His promises and proudly waving the comfort of His victory. Amen.\n \n",

The colors, the weather, the tones of voice and the sounds in the background. I want the full technicolor and surround-sound experience of these stories that we have known and read in the Word.\nLike Noah and the ark. Seriously, how many animals was he able to fit in there? Or Jonah and the whale. I don’t particularly want to watch his extraction from the whale’s vantage point—but then again, I kinda do. And then there’s Jesus in the manger and when the wise men show up, and little Mary in her new role as mama to the King.\nBut one particular story I’ve always loved is that of Queen Esther. Well, just teen Esther to start, but Queen by the finish. When it comes to this story in particular, with the high drama and the fashion and the plot twists, I want to watch it like a movie.\nAt the start of chapter 5, we see Esther making a crazy-brave step—going to the king uninvited. She puts on her royal clothing, probably layered and heavy, bedazzled from top to bottom (which I would love). And then she does something unexpected: she enters a place where she is not necessarily welcomed.\nI want to watch the movie of this real moment. I want to hear Esther’s dress swish across the stones as she walks. I want to see her pause before she turns the corner and take a deep breath. I want to see her make eye contact with the king.\nI want to see the spread laid out on the table in Esther 7, the hot soups and the cold charcuterie, the goblets of wine and the fruit and floral arrangements. I can imagine leaning forward in my seat as the drama unfolds around that banqueting table, and Queen Esther says the thing that changes everything.\nI want to see it all because that story at its moment in time saved the nation of Israel. It isn’t the first time we read about God saving His people, and it definitely wasn’t the last.\nWhen I imagine seeing the story of Esther in this way, my mind turns to Jesus and what it would be like to watch the stories of Him from the Bible unfold on the heavenly movie screen. I have never juxtaposed the two, never stood them next to each other; but in today’s reading, when I see Esther and Jesus side-by-side, it makes me teary. Esther was showing us, long before the Gospels were written, that one person’s sacrifice and courage could save millions.\nEsther gave up her life for a place, a palace, that was not her home.\nJesus gave up heaven for a broken place full of broken people who needed Him.\nEsther risked her life to save the people of Israel from physical death.\nJesus gave His life to save us all from eternal death.\nThe word picture is enough to make my heart sing along with the beloved Christmas song:\n“A thrill of hope a weary world rejoices\nFor yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!”\nI can only imagine the thrill of hope that passed through the Israelites’ homes when they heard their planned extinction was repealed by Esther’s courage. It’s the same thrill of hope we have in this season, knowing that Jesus’ courage in coming to Earth and going to the Cross has given us each a new and glorious and eternal morning, repealing after the darkness of our sin. Esther’s appeal to the king is a foreshadowing of Christ’s appeal to God the Father, offering His life in place of our own, rescuing us from certain destruction. \nAs the movie closes, we walk out of the theater, and the song continues as it should:\n“Fall on your knees…”\nFall on your knees in thanks and in praise, with a new understanding of what Jesus did: He accomplished the true and eternal rescue of His people.\n\n",

But Jesus firmly answered them, “A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah” (Matthew 12:39).\nThe sign of the prophet Jonah… what is that? A big fish drawing? I kind of wish it was. But the sign of Jonah is a sign of judgment for a “wicked and adulterous generation.” Jesus was condemning the Pharisees, like the Ninevites, as “those who cling to worthless idols” and “forsake faithful love” (Jonah 2:8).\nWe are still a wicked and adulterous generation. And as much as I’d like to think the problem is my depraved next door neighbor or the villain on the nightly news, the truth is, it’s me. I have the heart of Jonah. I have the heart of a Pharisee.\nWhile I would very much like to stay out of the category of those who cling to worthless idols (and I don’t like to be called “wicked” or “adulterous”), I fear we are all quick to turn to idols. When I am afraid, I will trust in chocolate, soft blankets, and Netflix. My idols seem to crop up everywhere I look. Do you find you are inclined to run to your comforts instead of running to Christ? \nJonah is notorious for running away to hide from scary things. And, I agree, the Ninevites were scary; they used to cut off the thumbs and gouge out the eyes of enemies. A brutal group like that hardly seems to deserve grace, mercy, and salvation.\nBut God’s call to Jonah was clear. “Go!” Run toward probable death or mutilation. Run toward those who do not deserve your love. Run into the storm.\nWe need the same mercy that God extended to to Jonah, the Ninevites, and the Pharisees. We needed someone to run into the storm for us. We needed one who would run toward certain death. Even though we did not deserve His love, Christ is the true and better Jonah because He ran into the heart of darkness so we wouldn’t have to.\nBut like Jonah, we are quick to forget the mercy we’ve been shown, and quick to take for granted the grace that kept us from drowning. \nThe sign of Jonah reminds us that another Jonah has come. Jesus entered the belly of the earth willingly. He put Himself in our place, cast over the side into the deep, bearing our curse. This true and better Jonah is slow to anger and abounding in compassion. \nJesus has calmed the storm of God’s judgment with His own sacrifice. As our lives were fading away, He raised us up from the pit. Despite all of our unfaithfulness, He offers His faithful love. \n \n\n",

And now, our deliverer has come. He is the hero of our story, the perfect spotless lamb sent to adorn the doorposts of our hearts with His own blood (1 Peter 1:17–21, Exodus 12:22).\nHe is the descendant from Eve sent to crush the head of the deceiver (Genesis 3:15). He is Isaac’s ram caught in the thicket, God’s perfectly timed provision of a substitute (Genesis 22:13). He is the heir of Abraham’s line—born by a miracle and filling the world with laughter (Genesis 22:18).\nHe gave Jacob the gracious gift of a limp to remind him of his weakness (Genesis 32:25). He is the new Joseph, the forgotten brother, unrecognizable in a foreign land (Genesis 42:8, John 1:11), though He alone possesses the resources needed to satisfy our spiritual famine.\nHe is our new Moses, sent by God to deliver us from the land of our slavery into our promised inheritance (Exodus 3:7–10). He doesn’t just deliver God’s Law to us (Exodus 34:29), He fulfills it on our behalf—perfectly (Matthew 5:17).\nHe is the faultless judge who rescues His people from our own waywardness (Judges 2:17, 2 Corinthians 3:4–6). He does what no other judge is able to do—He takes our hearts of stone and gives us hearts of flesh (Ezekiel 11:19).\nHe is the King the Lord promised to David, a ruler from his own body whose Kingdom the Lord would establish forever, ancient and strong (2 Samuel 7:12). He has courage deeper than David (Luke 6:1–5), wisdom greater than Solomon (Luke 11:31), and faith firmer than Elijah (Matthew 4:1–11). He is the remnant growing beneath the smoldering ruins of Judah, the Son to be given, the child to be born (Isaiah 9:6).\nHe is Immanuel—God with His people (Isaiah 6:13).\nWhere there is despair, He brings hope. Where there is brokenness, He brings healing. Where there is sadness, He brings joy. Where there is bondage, He sets people free.\nThe people of His day had grown up with the stories of Immanuel’s coming. They had heard the prophets implore them to listen, but seeing, they did not see, and hearing, they did not hear, nor did they understand (Matthew 13:13).\nBut who could blame them? Jesus grew up like a young plant, like a root out of dry ground with nothing in His form—no majesty or beauty—that would lead anyone to desire Him (Isaiah 53:1–3). No one could know by looking at Him that He had come to bear their grief and carry their sorrows. The days ahead for Him would bring suffering so great that people would consider Him stricken by God and afflicted.\nBut the purpose of this suffering was what pleased the Father. He would be wounded for our transgressions. He would be crushed for our iniquities. Upon Him would be laid the punishment that would bring His people peace, and by His wounds we would be healed (Romans 5:1, Hebrews 9:22, Isaiah 53:4–5).\nLike sheep, every last man, woman, and child has gone astray, each turning to their own way. So the Father sent His Son and laid on Him the iniquity of us all (Isaiah 53:6–7).\nUnder unjust allegations, Jesus was betrayed, arrested, tried, and put to death as a criminal. But death could not hold Him. He had done no wrong, so He owed it no wage. Jesus was never the victim of men; it was the will of His Father to crush Him. It was God who put Him through such grief to bear the iniquities of His people, making many unrighteous men righteous (Isaiah 53:8–12).\nNo one took His life from Him. He laid it down, and He took it up again, claiming victory over the grave (John 10:18).\nAll of this required a birth.\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\nadapted from Behold the Lamb of God: An Advent Narrative\n",

Perhaps it was even stranger for Mary to discover that God had formed an overall impression of her. She was known by God, and He favored her. He liked her (Luke 1:28).\nThe angel told Mary she would conceive a son who would rescue His people from their sins. God had already chosen His name—Jesus, which meant “salvation.”\nBut the angel’s message did not come without consequence for Mary and Joseph. It would lead these two young people to live as fugitives for a time, fleeing from the paranoia of a ruthless and powerful Roman ruler. And on top of all that, as her belly expanded, Mary and Joseph would have to endure the suspicious looks of friends and relatives who couldn’t help questioning her purity and his character.\nAll of this was coming, and so much more.\nThe angel continued with his message. Mary’s boy would grow to reign over the people of God as their Savior and King. The God who promised David so many years before that his royal line would see no end, would keep that ancient covenant by bringing an heir to Israel’s throne through this young woman.\n“But how can this be, since I’m still a virgin?” she asked. For her to bear this son, she must conceive, and virgins don’t conceive. Everyone knows this.\nThe angel explained that all the laws of nature are amendable by the one who wrote them. Mary lived in the world that was made, and the Maker of this world was the sole Author of what could and would happen here. How this would happen was incidental to the fact that it would. And God would be the one to do it.\nThe angel needed to pay Joseph a visit as well.\nJoseph was a decent man. He didn’t want to shame Mary, though he could have and no one would have blamed him. What could he do? His bride-to-be was pregnant, and he wasn’t the father. This burden must have weighed heavily on his heart, flooding his thoughts and his dreams.\nOne night as he tossed and turned, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. He had come to set something straight. This baby was not forming in Mary’s belly because of anything she had done. This was something God had done—something God was doing, part of the order and structure of His divine purpose.\n“Don’t be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because what has been conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to name Him Jesus, because He will save His people from their sins” (Matthew 1:20-21). There was a purpose in this for both Joseph and Mary. She would bear the child, he would name Him, and the child would save them from their sins.\nWas this what the prophet Isaiah meant when he foretold that a virgin would conceive and have a son who would be called Immanuel—God with us (Isaiah 7:14)? This virgin Isaiah spoke of, could this really be his Mary?\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\nadapted from Behold the Lamb of God: An Advent Narrative\n\n",

I have a little something of my own I want to give Him” (Matthew 2:8, paraphrased).\nAfter hearing him out, the Magi left for Bethlehem. It wasn’t long before their familiar star rose again, leading them like a shepherd leads its sheep to a house on the outskirts of town.\nWhen they found the King, it was no wonder He was nothing more than a murmur in Jerusalem. They entered the place where He lay and beheld a child in the arms of a young woman, practically still a girl.\nThere was no crown or majesty that would attract them to Him, no miracle they could see, no signs of greatness. Just a woman and her child. But there was something about that moment that only the woman, her husband, the Magi, and the child knew—something that bent the knees of those scholars to the posture of worship when they saw Him. This child was a King.\nOne of the Magi moved forward and produced a purse of gold, laying it at the child’s feet. Another came with a flask of myrrh, then another with a box of frankincense. Unaware that they were funding a hasty trip to Egypt necessitated by Herod’s paranoia, they gave these gifts for no other reason than to honor the one born King of the Jews.\nHe wasn’t even their king. Israel’s God was not their people’s god. And yet, they had come because the thought of a God of mercy with healing in His wings must have awakened in them a desire to be close to the one through whom that healing would flow. They followed the star, and after countless miles of sojourn, they found the King.\nIt was a quite a feat. They would rest well.\nBut that night as they drifted into a deep sleep of satisfaction, an angel, unfamiliar to them but well-known to Mary, stepped into their dreams and painted for them the bloody truth of who Herod really was and what he meant to do to this child. The angel warned them to take another route home (Matthew 2:12).\nHerod’s motives were murderous. History would remember him not only dripping with the blood of his own wives and sons, but with the blood of countless others, mostly boys under the age of two. But not this boy king. Herod would not take His life (John 10:18).\nThe Magi departed for home in secret, avoiding the area around Jerusalem.\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\nadapted from Behold the Lamb of God: An Advent Narrative\n\n",

Yet because of their handling of these dirty creatures, they themselves were unclean and thus prevented from keeping the ceremonial law. And because they were ceremonially unclean, they were often regarded as untrustworthy and irreligious.\nBut when the angel appeared to tell the shepherds about the birth of the Savior, he told them Christ the Lord had been born unto them (Luke 2:11). Though they lived most of their lives on the outside looking in, they would not be outsiders to this gift. The shepherds were the recipients of it.\nThis was big news. The shepherds sensed it, but the angels in Heaven knew it and their behavior showed it. Initially, it was just one glorious but solitary angel who appeared to these men in Bethlehem’s fields. But as soon as he announced Jesus’s birth, “suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God” (Luke 2:13).\nIt was as if there were millions of angels hiding just behind some celestial door, and once they heard, “Unto you is born this day a Savior, who is Christ the Lord!” they were unable to contain their joy any longer and all rushed in, praising God, singing, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom He is pleased” (Luke 2:14).\nThe spontaneous eruption of angelic praise became the lens through which the shepherds would see this moment: God was at work. This much was plain. But why had the glory of all glories appeared to the lowest of the lows? Why had the angel chosen to reveal this message to mere shepherds, unclean as they were?\nBecause poverty is relative. Could it be that from the perspective of heaven, the poor shepherds outside Bethlehem were no more or less poor than the rest of the world sleeping under its watch? Could it be that the poor of the earth were in fact all the people of the earth—poor in spirit, mourning and meek, hungry and thirsty for righteousness (Matthew 5:2-12)? Could it be that the Savior’s coming was for them as much as it was for anyone, and for anyone as much as it was for them?\nThe angels gave the shepherds a sign that left them speechless. Their Messiah and Savior could be found where the young lambs were kept. He would be the one not covered in wool, but wrapped in a swaddling cloth.\nWhen they found Jesus in the manger as the angel said, the very location of His birth was drenched in significance. The Savior had been born into their unclean world in the same manner as a lamb. The symbolism was not lost on them. He was born unto them.\nWhen the shepherds saw Jesus there, they saw not only that He had come, but they got a hint as to why. He came to be the perfect Lamb— the ultimate, lasting sacrifice. This baby’s coming was to accomplish and establish peace between the God of all creation and His image-bearers who habitually rejected Him.\nAnd so it would be all His days.\nFrom the manger in Bethlehem to the cross on Calvary, Jesus moved among the people, came into their homes, touched their blind eyes, and permitted their unfaithful hands to touch Him. He taught them profound lessons from ordinary events. He defended the defenseless and opposed the self-righteous. He ate at their tables, laughed with their children, and wept over their grief.\nNever did He abandon His purpose for coming, which was to die for a world of spirit-poor outsiders as the Lamb of God who takes their sin away. Jesus was born poor. He lived poor. And He died poor for the sake of His people.\nThe shepherds could not have known that this boy came into this world in the same way He would leave it: out in the open, among the outcast, poor, and despised, but driven by one purpose—to ransom captive Israel that mourns in lonely exile until the Son of God appears.\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\nadapted from Behold the Lamb of God: An Advent Narrative\n\n",

They weren’t children anymore, but they weren’t quite grownups either. They were somewhere between who they used to be and who they were becoming, and now, the moment had come which would change not only their lives, but the entire course of history.\nPain stabbed at her. Then it happened again, worse this time. And again.\nAdam and Eve took the forbidden fruit and one of the consequences of that act of rebellion shot through Mary from head to toe, every few minutes now.\nEventually, as if cresting a ridge, her labor gave way to delivery, and her groaning gave way to the sound of the cries of little lungs drawing in the breath of earth for the first time.\nTo the wonder of the humble man and relief of the weary woman, they beheld Him who, though He was the Son of God, was every bit a fragile, tiny baby.\nTogether, Mary and her husband cleaned their child and wrapped His little arms and legs in strips of cloth to keep Him warm. After they laid Him in a manger and finally exhaled, they gave Him the name Jesus. And both remembered why.\nThe incarnation of the Savior of the world could have come to pass any number of ways. But God, in His infinite wisdom, chose this. He chose this couple for this night in this shelter. This boy, the angel told them, would be the heir to David’s throne. He would be their Wonderful Counselor, their Mighty God, their Everlasting Father, their Prince of Peace. The government would be upon His shoulders (Isaiah 9:2-7).\nBut there was nothing particularly complex or regal about this moment in the stable outside Bethlehem. There were no heralds in the streets announcing the birth of the King. By all appearances, it was a humble, simple affair, seemingly incidental to everything else going on in David’s town that night. But it wasn’t incidental. It had been God’s plan from the beginning: this King of Kings was “chosen before the foundation of the world” (1 Peter 1:20).\nThere, on the edge of Bethlehem, a child was born. A Son was given. It was the most significant moment in the history of the world.\nThe zeal of the Lord Almighty had accomplished this (Isaiah 9:7).\nThanks be to God.\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\nadapted from Behold the Lamb of God: An Advent Narrative\n\n",
