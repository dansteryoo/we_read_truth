    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 1:1-31, Exodus 19:5-6, James 1:18\n\nI work with a truly spectacular group of people, but we don’t always see eye to eye. \n\nJessica, for example, is fiercely protective of words, watching over grammatical details like comma placement and hyphen length with laser-like focus. Ryan, I’m convinced, will defend the creative integrity of the She Reads Truth brand as long as he has breath, and Abby has yet to sit through a meeting without bringing to our attention the needs and desires of you, the Shes who read Truth with us. We all have different jobs, and sometimes it is our job to disagree. \n\nRaechel and I learned this early on in working together, back when it was just the two of us: seeing things differently is a gift to be stewarded, not a tension to be avoided. Today there are eighteen of us at SRT headquarters, each bringing different skills and perspectives to the conference room table. But we are a team. We are here for each other, for the work set before us, and for you. Above all, we are here to hold out God’s Word and bring glory to Him. Our differences help, not hinder, this pursuit. \n\nIt’s easy for me to see God’s provision in the differences among our team members. But I’m embarrassed to admit that I often expect homogeneity in the Church. I find myself frustrated by our differences, bothered that we can’t all agree on large and small aspects of our faith and life as followers of Jesus. I’m saddened when these differences go beyond disagreements to cause division, and discouraged when these divisions are not easily overcome. I forget that God’s Word and perfect wisdom are not diminished by our limited understanding or altered by our various opinions. \n\nIn his letters to the church at Corinth, the Apostle Paul encourages this congregation of young believers to embrace their common and primary identity in Christ. He desires for them to know and act on the truth that “we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body” and “we were all given one Spirit to drink” (1 Corinthians 12:13). The image of the Church as one body appears throughout these letters, making clear Paul’s resounding declaration: We are many, but we are one in Christ. \n\nEven here, in the first chapter of 1 Corinthians, we can sense Paul fighting for the unity of the Church. His tone is somber, even harsh at times, because the topic is not casual; it is critical. God has welcomed us—different as we are, different as we are designed to be—into His family through the grace and power of Jesus Christ. He did not call us because we are wise or powerful or strong. Rather, Christ Jesus “became wisdom from God for us—our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, in order that, as it is written: Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord” (1 Corinthians 1:30-31). We are part of this fellowship by grace alone, and it is by grace that we live and grow in unity with one another.\n\nAs you read 1 & 2 Corinthians, ask the Holy Spirit to open your eyes to see the Church all around you. Ask Him to teach you more about Himself, His body of believers, and the truth of His Word. Like the church at Corinth, we come to this text from a colorful array of backgrounds, experiences, and traditions. But we have a Savior who binds us. May His mercy and grace unite us as we read. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 2:1-16, Romans 8:26-30, Ephesians 1:13-14\n\nI recently listened to an interview with Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia. Wales said he started Wikipedia because he wanted to make information available to everyone for free. Today, I’m sure most of us with an internet connection have benefitted from Wales’s aspirations.\n\nWith Wikipedia, as well as countless other sites on the web, we can know almost anything about any person, place, or thing. It is the Information Age, after all. The Information Age has given us the illusion that we can know everything. It has given us the illusion that we no longer need to grapple with the unknown. And it’s tempting to believe that knowledge—the kind that’s available to us with the click of a button—is equivalent to wisdom.\n\nBut it’s not.\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 2, Paul writes about the difference between the wisdom of men and spiritual wisdom. The wisdom of men is “coming to nothing,” he says. “On the contrary, we speak God’s hidden wisdom in a mystery, a wisdom God predestined before the ages for our glory” (vv.6-7). \n\nPaul then explains that God’s wisdom is no longer hidden in mystery because it has been revealed to us by God’s Spirit. What is this wisdom? In short: “Jesus Christ and him crucified” (v.2). It seems so simple—too simple, especially in the Information Age—for the idea of wisdom to be boiled down to this one simple truth. And yet, this is what Scripture tells us.\n\nThe temptation is to fill up our minds with as much “wisdom” as possible. We gather knowledge in an attempt to be the smartest in the room and because we find security in thinking all of our questions can be answered with a Google search. \n\nBut spiritual wisdom frees us from relying on our own knowledge. It frees us from having to answer every question, and it opens up our lives to the power of the Spirit. In this, paradoxically, Scripture says we are able to “evaluate everything” (v.15). When we are not sure what to do, where to turn or who to talk to, we have the Spirit. When we are confused, disheartened, angry, we have the Spirit. And this Spirit is wisdom. This Spirit gives us more than the entire archive of Wikipedia ever could. It gives us “the mind of Christ” (v.16).\n\nDo you believe you have the mind of Christ? Do you trust the Spirit who has been given to you? Or are you still scrolling the internet looking for answers?\n\nKnowledge is a wonderful tool, and I am grateful to live in an age when we have such ready access to it. But no matter how much knowledge I acquire, it will never measure up to the Holy Spirit within me. That quiet, still, discerning voice. The very Spirit of God who gives me the very mind of Christ. \n\nLet us seek spiritual wisdom first. Let us ask the Spirit for guidance first. Let us cling to our hope that is not in knowledge or the Information Age, but in Christ Himself.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Readings: 1 Corinthians 3:1-23, John 5:24, Romans 5:1\n\nMy first year of high school, I was placed on the junior varsity cheerleading squad. This shouldn’t have been such a big deal. I was a freshman, after all. But most of friends had made it to the varsity squad, where the girls were clad in glittery uniforms, while the JV team only had t-shirts with iron-on decals. \n\nAt the first JV football game of the season, I tumbled across the track, throwing my back handsprings like a circus performer. I wanted to make sure the varsity cheerleaders knew a mistake had been made: clearly, they should have given me a spot on their coveted squad. When I got home that night, exhausted yet satisfied that I’d done the job, my mother let it slip that she’d “enjoyed the Claire show.” Her words stung, but I got the message. I was being prideful, and she’d seen right through my charade.\n\nWhen I think about pride, I often think about myself at that JV game. I was so convinced I deserved a position on the varsity squad that I spent the night showing off, rather than actually paying attention to the football game. After all, football was the whole reason we were there. The cheering was secondary.\n\nPaul calls out the Corinthians on this same kind of sophomoric pride. He calls out their useless squabbling over their allegiance to a teacher—as if by following Paul, they were more righteous than their friends who followed Apollos. Whether they knew it or not, the Corinthians had lost sight of the most important point of all—that is, Jesus—and had turned their focus completely on themselves. \n\nThat’s what pride does. It turns all of our attention inward. \n\nFor adult-me, self-pity is the most common form of pride. When I feel left out by a group of friends, the sadness that creeps up isn’t just sadness at the rejection; it’s also a prideful entitlement, which shouts, I should have been invited! Pride can hide in our allegiances—to particular brands, particular books, particular ways of eating, thinking, or voting. Rigid loyalty to anything other than Christ should alert us to destructive pride hiding beneath the surface.\n\nPaul criticizes the Corinthians for falling victim to that distraction, and he doesn’t mince words. He calls them babies! He says they’re acting like typical, worldly people. And I wonder, Am I really all that different from them?\n\nPerhaps my cheerleading story is a silly example, but I think it applies. When it comes to Christianity, what am I holding onto that is secondary to the gospel of Christ? Do I take pride that I’m a part of a certain Bible study, small group, or online devotion series? Do I feel hurt to be left off of a specific worship team? Do I have allegiance to a certain writer, church community, or social-justice mission? \n\nThose things are all well and good. As Paul says, they might be part of the house we’re building, but they will never be the foundation. The gospel is never Jesus and—it’s only Jesus. When it comes to our faith, Paul calls us to let go of everything that’s not Him.\n\nWe are not typical; we are temples. The Spirit of God lives in us (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). And as such, we need no ornaments. We need no special brands. No special invitations. No special groups or labels. No allegiances to a specific preacher. The foundation is Jesus. Anything else can stay or go; only our pride tells us otherwise.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 4:1-21, Zephaniah 2:3, 1 Peter 5:5\n\nYou don’t have to have a Bible college diploma hanging on your wall. You don’t need a passport stamped from developing countries. Your name need not appear on the official list of staff members for your church. Plant your feet firmly in this truth: If you are a follower of Jesus, you are already a minister for the gospel. Because the stakes are high, this reality can paralyze us. We throw around words like “calling” and “ministry” so often, but we secretly suspect we’re somehow doing it wrong. \n\nWhile confirming our assignment to be followers and leaders, Paul invites us to rest in this call. He offers us a two-word job description for ministry here in 1 Corinthians 4, inviting us to throw giftedness, opportunity, and needs into a pot, and boil ministry down to its very essence. What is ultimately required of us as ministers? To be “servants of Christ and managers of the mysteries of God” (v.1).\n\nWe are “managers of the mysteries of God.” Gulp! That sounds weighty, but in the same passage, Paul warns us “not to go beyond what is written” (v. 6). In other words, stick with Scripture. The mysteries of God we’re responsible to carry are the good news of the gospel and the Word of God. \n\nEvery believer—from the youngest to the oldest among us, both Bible scholars and Bible newbies—is a carrier of the good news with a shared responsibility to know and proclaim the Word. Paul is urging us, as disciples in ministry, to think of the Bible like a treasure. And it is! Like finding a cache of jewels buried in the backyard, we didn’t create this treasure, yet we get to claim it as our own as we carry it and deliver it to both the fellow believers and non-believers we rub elbows with each day. \n\nGod’s Word is a treasure because it reveals who God is. He is supreme, sufficient, spectacular, and in the full-time business of saving us from our sin. This cannot help but bend our knees and turn our hearts. As we steward God’s Word, we step into the other shoe that comes with ministry; we become servants. \n\nWe are willing to serve Christ’s Church because of all He has done for us. We are willing to serve those who don’t know Him by sharing who He is. We are willing to serve each other because we know now, deep in our guts, that none of us deserves a seat at this table. The chord we are bound to is grace, and it makes us want to share it in abundance with one another. \n\nRegardless of your day job, no matter what titles you hold, and in spite of your sin and failures—you are a minister of the gospel if you are in Christ Jesus. His grace is your qualification. So serve faithfully and joyfully the God “who will both bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the intentions of the hearts. And then praise will come to each one from God” (v.5). Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 5:1-13, Leviticus 18:8, Galatians 6:1-10\n\nAre you shocked when you read the latest news headlines? According to Paul’s letter to the Corinthian church, we shouldn’t be surprised at all by the terrible acts of the world. After all, if a man is not anchored in Christ, why should he walk in the way of Christ? Why wouldn’t his every action ultimately come from greed and selfish ambition?\n\nPaul tells us there is a fundamental difference between Christians and the world. We are fully changed by Jesus, and therefore, we are measured by a different stick altogether. Everywhere you look, the world is going to cheat and deceive, but why not? If we do not know Christ and are not changed by Him, there is no reason not to cheat and steal if we can get away with it. But as Christians we claim the name of Christ, and He has changed our hearts. We have every reason to choose what is right, even when no one is looking. And not only do we have reason, we have a responsibility. \n\nIn 1 Corinthians 5, Paul takes on the topic of immorality with the Church, and he does not do so casually. Sin among members of the body of Christ affects the whole body of believers. “Don’t you know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough?” Paul asks, an undeniable urgency in his tone. Though he is not with them in person, Paul is “present in spirit,” and he demands his brothers and sisters act in a manner worthy of Christ’s sacrifice (v.5). He asks them to remember their new measuring stick: the gospel and grace of Jesus.\n\nSo what are we to do with those in the world who don’t know Jesus, and who continually and exuberantly choose what is evil? Paul addresses this, too, explaining that it is God and God alone who judges (1 Corinthians 5:13). \n\nIt’s such a relief that it’s not our job to busybody around and judge the world for doing exactly what the world is wont to do. God will judge. Instead of our judgment, God is calling us to give our energy and “not [tire] of doing good” (Galatians 6:9). We can share the gospel and we can do good, but there’s no need for us to hustle our judgment on the world—it’s not even our job.\n\nAnd what about our brothers and sisters in the faith who do wrong? According to Scripture, reconciliation is the goal. Listen to these fiercely kind words from Galatians:\n\nBrothers and sisters, if someone is overtaken in any wrongdoing, you who are spiritual, restore such a person with a gentle spirit, watching out for yourselves so that you also won’t be tempted. Carry one another’s burdens; in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. —Galatians 6:1-2\n\nLook out for each other! “As we have opportunity, let us work for the good of all, especially for those who belong to the household of faith” (v.10). Have zeal for doing what is right, restore your Christian brothers and sisters with patience, and do not grow weary in your work of doing good. The Lord transforms His children, and He makes them fit for the task.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 6:1-20, Matthew 18:15-20, Titus 3:4-7\n\nLast August, I started snapping photos of waiting rooms in doctors’ offices. In an attempt to manage my pre-medical exam nerves, I snapped the first picture in an empty, grey walk-in clinic during my lunch break. I assured myself that when I walked out of the room and closed the door, I’d look back at the picture on my phone and laugh at how silly my fear was.\n\nAlmost a year later, I’ve amassed quite a collection of waiting room images. I still have the strange spasm in my shoulder that causes pain and is now considered chronic, at least by those doctors. It keeps me up at night, and hurts most while doing the work I love and feel called to—namely, writing. This year has brought more questions than answers, leaving me insecure about my pain. In the end, I feel like my body is more a vessel of shame and weakness than a temple of praise.\n\nIn some ways, our bodies ache with sin and pain. Our muscles, memory, and metabolism may fail us. Our bodies betray us with limits, and we betray our bodies when we disregard those limits. All this brokenness is an ever-present reminder of Christ’s body broken for us, our sin, and our shame.\n\nThe apostle Paul tells us we’ve been washed, sanctified, and justified “in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God” (v.11). Therefore, because of Christ’s sacrificial death and resurrection for us, our bodies are no longer our own; they were bought with a price. “So glorify God with your body” (vv.19–20).\n\nPaul tell us to flee from sexual immorality, to not be mastered by anything, to avoid legal disputes with one another—all in an effort to glorify God. Without the context of Jesus, this can begin to sound like a legalistic to-do list. But as theologian Henri Nouwen says, “The church is not an institution forcing us to follow rules but a community inviting us to still our hunger and thirst at its table.” \n\nIn 1 Corinthians 6, we find ways to still our hunger and thirst (1 Corinthians 4:11), but when we try to do so without filling them up with heavenly things instead, our bodies still feel like empty vessels of shame. Jesus is the only one who can truly fill us up and sustain us. When we turn to Him, we’re reminded that it was His body that was broken, His blood that was shed, for us. \n\nTo glorify God with our bodies means to place physical trust in His plan to bring redemption to our brokenness. It means taking part in the groans of humanity and the painfulness of sin. It means remembering His promises to bring wholeness and healing now, even if we don’t know when it’s coming. \n\nAcknowledging our aches and limitations is at the heart of what it is to be a child of God. He is all that we will ever need to withstand our heartache, pain, and sin. In our weakness, His power is perfected, and He is glorified (2 Corinthians 12:9). \n\nWe are not our own. We are His glory vessels. Thanks be to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Principles of Marriage",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 7:1-40, Genesis 2:24\n\nAlmost half of marriages end in divorce, and the average length of a marriage that ends in divorce is only eight years (according to 2014 US census data). Eight years! It’s shocking that we stand up and promise “‘til death do us part,” yet only half of us make it past eight years. Marriage is hard. And indeed, the skills necessary to simply get along long-term with other people, not just spouses, are really difficult to come by. When we concede that marriage doesn’t have to last, we also allow that friendships don’t need to last. When the going gets tough, it’s just so much easier to find new friends and start over. Except it’s not.\n\nOn paper, marriage is an unachievable task. Paul commands wives to submit to their husbands, and then he turns to the husbands and piles onto the first unbelievable task this astonishing humdinger: “Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church” (Ephesians 5:22-25). In one fell swoop, it seems Paul is making an open-and-shut case that marriage is just never going to work. He even follows this up by saying, essentially, marriage is too much for him, and he’s chosen to keep out of the fray; and if anyone else has the constitution for it, they should stay unmarried also (1 Corinthians 7:8).\n\nBut here’s the problem: not everyone has Paul’s self-control, and instead we, ahem, “burn with desire” (v. 9).  We fall in love, and that love leads us to make wildly extravagant promises to each other. We promise, in our best clothes, in front of all our aunts and uncles, to love and honor one another for the rest of our lives. These are the bravest, most ridiculous promises I’ve ever made.\n\nI want to write a book titled, ’Til Death Do Us Part, and Other Lies I Told While Wearing a White Ball Gown. Because even though I’ve been married for thirteen years, have I truly kept my wedding vows? Have you? Even before we’d driven off into the sunset, I had already broken my vows. My heart was full of love, but my soul was still inclined to offer my new husband far less than the love I’m called to give. But that’s really the whole point. And that is why marriage is a covenant. We make extravagant promises that we cannot keep, but God keeps His promises. He created marriage and designed it to last. \n\nGod has called us to live in peace (v. 15), and it’s His peace that makes it possible for us to do so. I can rely on Him. He keeps His promises. He is there in the ceremony, walking through the covenant just like He did in the Old Testament. He makes our covenants, and He keeps up both ends of the deal. May we look to Him to preserve our marriages, our friendships, and our families. He is the One who takes our brave words made on brave days and makes them come true.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 8:1-13, John 10:14, 2 Timothy 2:14-19\n\nI love the phrase “read the room.” I distinctly remember the first time it became a phrase our friend group started to use. We were hanging out, reacting to a situation that had not gone the way I’d hoped it would. Some folks in the room were making light-hearted remarks, and I started glowering at them. READ THE ROOM, I thought, not even bothering to veil my frustration. I was hurting, and they didn’t see it. The words might not have been directed at me, but I was intensely vulnerable. \n\nPaul is helping the Corinthians navigate a similar sort of tension in this passage. Someone has asked Paul a question: Is it okay for Christians to eat meat that has been previously sacrificed to pagan idols? In Corinth at the time, most meat available had been used as part of temple sacrifices. So Corinthian Christians were wondering if it was okay to eat that meat, whether they purchased it in a market or were dining with non—Christian friends. \n\nPaul’s answer is pretty straightforward. Basically, if you’re asking this question because you’re a Christian, then you know that idols are nothing, so it would be totally fine because “all things are from him, and we exist for him” (1 Corinthians 8:6). But it’s not really about you, Paul explains. “Not everyone has this knowledge,” he says, so “be careful that this right of yours in no way becomes a stumbling block for the weak” (vv. 7,9). The warning Paul gives here isn’t about eating meat; it’s about how knowledge leads to pride and a feeling of superiority over weaker brothers and sisters in Christ. It’s about reading the room. \n\nFor some new Christians, eating meat that had been sacrificed to an idol would have been difficult. Paul says it could “wound their weak conscience,” which is a sin against Christ (v.12). If Christians who were still a bit unsteady in their faith saw more mature Christians eating sacrificed meat, it could cause confusion. Those who had been tempted to pray to pagan idols in the past might be tempted to see the meat as something more than it was, while to more mature, discerning eyes, it was just meat. \n\nPaul gives the Corinthians, and us, a basic template for answering this and similar questions: put others first. Let your conscience be guided by whatever is best for your brother or sister in Christ. Throughout 1 Corinthians, Paul makes this point that we are to act in love, care for others, and live in the freedom of Christ that allows us to put others first. \n\n“Read the room” is a sarcastic, modern phrase that reminds us that there are others present. Paul is much more winsome, but no less pointed, in reminding more mature Christians that there are new believers watching, learning from them. This reminder is poignant for me as well. I’m often tempted to be sarcastic, to push the boundaries of humor, or cross other lines that might be confusing for non-believers or new Christians.\n\nBut putting my witness to Christ first and caring for those around me requires that I live differently. It requires that I always read the room, and know that how I act, speak, and treat others reflects my identity in Jesus. Paul says that if meat were to cause a brother to stumble, he would never eat meat again. I pray for that sense of discernment in my own life. I long for a careful, caring heart like Paul’s and, even more so, for a heart like Christ’s.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 9:1-27, Matthew 15:11, Romans 15:17-19\n\nI was a gangly eighth grader with the athleticism of an opossum. As one does in middle school, I signed up for the track team strictly because my friends had done the same. There was not a cell in my hormonal body that wanted to run the four-lap race assigned to me. I lumbered to the starting line hauling a bundle of nerves and a posture of defeat. \n\nThen… Bang! The starting pistol fired, and we began circling the track. As I crested the final turn of my third lap, I noticed a few frontrunners were crossing the finish line a full lap ahead of me. Hungry for glory, I sealed my fate in the Track Hall of Shame. I squared my shoulders and crossed the finish line in style, confident no one would notice I still had a lap left to run. \n\nAssuming I’d successfully cheated my way onto the winners’ platform, I celebrated my victory. It was a brief moment of glory followed by a humiliating spectacle of defeat. As the last of the runners crossed the finish line, I felt a tap on my shoulder. \n\n“You,” said a man with a stopwatch in his hand. “Run your last lap.” I ran the final lap of the race on an empty track. It was the opposite of a victory lap. \n\nSuch is the image Paul paints for us. As disciples and disciple makers, we are runners on the track of faith. God’s truth is a baton that has been passed from Abraham to Isaac, to the apostles, to Paul, to us. We are pushing toward the prize of making Christ known. Yet, it’s easy to forget what we’re doing here. We’re so often distracted by the crowd in the stands or the other runners pumping and huffing beside us. Paul reminds us that those sideways glances can cost us the victory. \n\n“Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified” (vv. 24-27). \n\nThe apostle isn’t writing about salvation here. No amount of training or self-discipline could earn us that. Salvation is ours forever because of Christ’s work, not ours. But, let’s be honest; it’s possible to be saved, but not sowing. To be redeemed, but not reaping. To be an ambassador of faith, but not a good one. It’s possible to run the race of faith, but not run it well. \n\nPaul’s obsession with the gospel (vv. 15–18) is what glued his eyeballs to the finish line. He could face criticism, hardship, and scarcity, and still keep running because allegiance to the gospel was the medal he imagined hanging around his neck. \n\nSince we don’t want to cross the finish line with heads hanging in defeat, how do we keep our own eyes on the prize? Like a runners cadence, we repeat... \n\nIt’s about the gospel.\nIt’s about the gospel.\nIt’s about the gospel.\n\nLet us keep running!\n\n",

I’m sure I’m not alone here, but I will admit that my affection for the plastic figures may have been a little extreme. I didn’t have any sisters, and my one and only brother is six years older than me. So in a lot of ways, my dolls were my friends. I’d spend hours dressing them, teaching them, taking them for walks. I sat them in circles for storytime, and made sure they were “fed” before bedtime. They were special to me, and although I had way more than I needed, I still longed for the latest, prettiest, most updated versions available. And I never wanted to share any of them, with anyone. \n\nI remember one particular day at my grandparents’ house, a new friend was visiting. As usual, I was busy playing with the set of babies my grandparents purchased just for their house. I was doing what brought me joy, and it never occurred to me to share. Before long, my grandfather casually said, “Wynter, which doll can your friend play with?” Unsurprisingly, I refused to part with any. \n\nIt’s easy to think back on this story and see my actions for exactly what they were: selfish. My loving grandfather would have been completely justified in taking each of my dolls from me. After all, my actions had proven me to be undeserving. But in his love for me and his desire to see my heart changed, he did not take my dolls. Instead he pulled me close and explained how my lack of care for another person had not only hurt someone else, but had also disappointed him.\n\nWhen our Heavenly Father notices our selfishness, He gently reminds us of what real love actually looks like. In 1 Corinthians 10, the apostle Paul says, “No one is to seek his own good, but the good of the other person” (v. 24). We have all been blessed by God’s matchless goodness. Jesus didn’t just give up a part of what He had every right to hold onto. Instead, He gave it all, His very life. \n\nJesus’ choice to pursue goodness for everyone is the ultimate measure of seeking goodness for another. May we imitate His love because He first loved us.\n\nIf then there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any affection and mercy, make my joy complete by thinking the same way, having the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. —Philippians 2:1-2\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 11:2-34, Matthew 26:26-28, Romans 3:25-26\n\nIn an early episode of I Love Lucy, Lucy is pregnant, distracted, and she hasn’t fixed Ricky dinner. The poor man is irritated, miserable, and hungry. He declares his need for steak and potatoes, but with time running short, Lucy counters with a fried egg sandwich—and he scoffs at this paltry offering. At this point, my husband and I had to stop the episode and look at each other: “He literally can’t make food for himself? She’s had a busy day and he won’t accept a simpler meal?” The difference between the dinner expectations of 1952 television husbands and 2018 television husbands are surprisingly different.\n\nThe cultural expectations for the roles of men and women have changed even more dramatically since Paul wrote this letter to the Corinthians. Paul’s instructions about head coverings and spheres of authority make us a little uncomfortable. But head coverings for women were pretty normal, even as recently as 100 years ago. Just because our husbands can make their own dinner and we wear our hair in loose, glorious ringlets, doesn’t mean we’re getting it exactly right. It just means we happen to be the generation walking around right now. It doesn’t make us smarter or better equipped to appreciate authority than generations past.\n\nWho should be making dinner? And who’s hair should be blowing in the breeze? It’s tempting for us to get caught up here in these little brambly questions but miss the important issue here of authority. Who is our authority? First, you know what my answer will be: Christ is the Lord of creation, the Lord of men, women, communities, families. All authority has been given to Him on heaven and on earth. So, if you had any adorable delusions whether the ultimate authority is your own self, or the president, or your two-year-old, put them to rest. There is one final authority.\n\nThis same Lord of all, the ultimate authority, yielded up all on our behalf, giving His very body and blood to rescue us from just condemnation.\n\n“On the night when He was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread, and when He had given thanks, broke it, and said, ‘This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.’\n\nIn the same way also He took the cup, after supper, and said, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.’ For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes” (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).\n\nThe question of authority comes down to yielding our own will to the will of someone else. When we eat and drink “in remembrance of” Him, do we truly yield our all to Him? Do we remember the glory He laid aside for us, or do we seek our own glory? When we hold back in order to honor ourselves—seeking our own will, based on our own understanding—the result is the same as it was in Corinth: divisions arise, each man seeks his own gain, and some fall to excess, while others are neglected.\n\nHe served us dinner and washed our feet, without hesitation and without reservation. And for the meal before Him, which signaled His own agonizing death, He gave thanks. Our hearts ought to be full of thanksgiving in turn, full of a desire to serve and honor others. When we see the world as Christ’s, we can make the dinner, we can love our neighbor, we can honor our husbands, we can yield to God’s will for us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 12:1-31, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Thessalonians 5:19-21\n\nMusic and theater were a big part of my upbringing. My sisters and I were not the most athletic kids, so choir, voice lessons, and musicals were our sport. I was never really content with just being a member of the choir, or a background part in a musical. I always wanted the solo or the lead.\n\nPerhaps there was a church member or two in Corinth who felt the same way. Maybe they were trying to steal the show, or maybe they were trying to prove their gifts were better than someone else’s. Paul enters and tells them that as believers, we operate as one unit, not solo performers. We are all members of one body, and “the body is not one part but many” (1 Corinthians 12:14).\n\nEven though I said goodbye to my music and theater days long ago, I still struggle with this truth. I still want to stand out. I still want the “best” gifts. I still crave that recognition. (My family didn’t nickname me “Drama Mama” for nothing.) But if we look at what I Corinthians 12 really says about our gifts, we see that it has little to do with our individual talents, and much more to do with the way they unify us as believers.\n\nThe variation of gifts in Christian community highlights our need for one another. Where I am weak, another member of the body is strong. Where someone else is weak, I am strong. Individually, we can only go so far with our own gifts. Together, we are a full cast, the complete body of Christ. This makes us able to serve our community, one another, and in turn, bring glory to God. Our gifts serve a greater purpose: unification.\n\nAs Paul explained, “Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit. There are different ministries, but the same Lord. And there are different activities, but the same God activates each gift in each person” (vv. 4-6). The emphasis here is on what’s the same about us, not what’s different. We all have the same Spirit. We all have the same Lord. We all have the same Father.\n\nThe Church is at its best when we operate as one unit, not as talented individuals trying to outshine each other. When we operate as a unit, we reflect Christ,  “[f]or as the body is one and has many parts… so also is Christ” (v.12).\n\nIn spite of my desire for the spotlight, I am learning that the Christian life is not always a loud one. What we do in love and service to our Lord may not always have an audience. So much of this journey is spent using our gifts in quiet ways that may not bring us individual attention, but will bring balance and unity to the body—this is how our gifts were intended to serve.\n\nMay we stop running after the spotlight and find contentment working backstage. May we seek unity above our own glory, and may we be grateful for diversity in the body and all the gifts of the Spirit bestowed on us by the Father.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 13:1-13, Ezekiel 20:35, Galatians 5:5-26\n\nLove, as framed in 1 Corinthians 13, was framed for me as a child of six. It was a perfect square made of 15 smaller squares, each cross-stitched in pastel blues and pinks and yellows. I stared at it for hours of my childhood because it sat above the baby grand piano at which I endured years of piano lessons. \n\nEvery week I would stare at those squares in the dim light of my piano teacher’s studio and count with the metronome until I could leave. It’s no wonder she told my parents I was a hopeless case and to put me in soccer or horseback riding when, after four years of lessons, I was still incapable of playing the most rudimentary scales. I wasn’t listening to a word she said. But I still remember the cross-stitched squares perfectly today. \n\nI don’t know about you, but love is hard for me. Love as a noun is okay. It’s very ethereal and nebulous and conjures up good feelings, emotions. “Love is love,” is what the cool kids are all saying. Okay, well… yes, but milk is milk and books are books and, of course, a thing is what it is. But what does that mean? Love as a noun is something, yes, but love is so much more than the smell of a newborn, or the flutters of a new relationship, or the feeling you have toward street tacos or 230-calories-per-serving ice cream or getting the thing you want. Love is so much more and so much harder than those things. It often feels more like a tone-deaf person practicing scales than it does anything sweet or nice or pastel.\n\nIf I’m honest, real love (the kind Paul writes about in this chapter) sounds like a symphony I’m never going to be able to play. It sounds beautiful and hopeless at the same time. I am never going to be capable of being perfectly patient, perfectly kind, perfectly without envy or boasting. I can barely bear some things, but how could I possibly bear all things? If what Paul is talking about is the definition of love, I’ve been practicing for a long time, and I need to find another hobby.  \n\nThe comfort of this chapter, for the ones who are as hopeless about love as I am, is further down: “Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known” (v. 12, emphasis mine).\n\nThe harmony of these two sections clue us in to the true meaning of this text: just as my knowledge is partial, my love is partial. But just as I am fully known, I am fully loved. By whom? By the only One whose love is perfect. By the only One whose love is perfectly patient, perfectly kind, perfectly able to bear all things, believe all things, hope all things, and endure all things. There is only One who has endured all things, and this is Christ. \n\nPractice will not make my love perfect or even easy in this Christian life, no matter how hard we run our scales. Discipline is good and sanctification is sure; kindness will come more easily, patience more freely, but still imperfectly. But Paul assures us our dim sight won’t last forever and the scales will someday fall. Even still, “these three remain: faith, hope, and love” (v. 13). One day we will see fully and be seen fully by the greatest of all these—Love Himself, Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 14:1-39, Exodus 25:8, 1 John 4:1-3\n\nIn a few short weeks, my husband and I will board a plane to China to bring home our son. We’ve never met in person. He’s seen photos of us, and he knows to call us “Mama” and “Baba.” But he doesn’t know us, not really, nor do we know him. Yet God has tethered our hearts to one another in a way I think I may not fully understand this side of eternity. God has made us a family even now, before we’ve met, and that is a fact that overshadows all others. \n\nI’m nervous about bringing our boy home. I’m excited, overjoyed, in tears with anticipation; but the unknowns that lie ahead make my chest tighten. I have to remind myself to practice what I learned when waiting for our first three children to arrive: Breathe. Just breathe. \n\nI wonder how he’ll adjust to his new home, to his big sister and big brothers, to his two big dogs and the cat and the chickens in the backyard. I wonder how he’ll take to American culture and American food. But lately, I’m most nervous about the language. He speaks Mandarin; we speak English. Will we be able to communicate? Will he understand our botched renditions of “I love you” and “You are our son” and “It’s okay” in his native tongue? \n\nHow and what we communicate to our son matters. Everything we say, from playful banter to earnest conversation, should flow from our love and desire to care for him. Our words are rooted in the fact that we are family. \n\nWhen Paul addresses the gifts of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 14, specifically the gifts of prophesying and speaking in tongues, he says some things that are tough for our modern ears to understand. But if we look at the chapter as a whole, we can see a theme emerge: “Seek to excel in building up the church” (v. 12). In this lengthy chapter, Paul acknowledges that the Holy Spirit is real, that the Spirit indeed gives gifts that can only come from God, and that these gifts are good and God-honoring. But in the same breath, he offers a warning about how these gifts are to be used—and, as importantly, why they are to be used. According to Paul, the reason is more straightforward than we might expect: “Everything is to be done for building up” (v. 26). \n\nThe Church, the body of believers, is God’s dwelling place on earth. Just as God’s presence filled the tabernacle in the Old Testament, His Spirit fills those who have put our faith in Jesus. The way we conduct our worship and our gatherings matter because God is in our midst, and “God is not a God of disorder but of peace” (v. 33). Furthermore, our interactions and our meeting together ought to be governed by unity, not discord. We are a family—a family established by God Himself. Our words and actions are rooted in this eternal truth. \n\nThe diversity within the family of God is a beautiful, purposeful thing. May the Holy Spirit that binds us make our hearts tender toward our fellow family members, seeking to love the Church and build her up in all we say and do. May we worship in a way that causes the unbelievers in our midst to proclaim, “God is really among you.” \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 15:1-19, Ephesians 2:4-7, Hebrews 2:5-9\n\nI thought I was going to be a lawyer when I grew up. I wanted to be a doctor for the longest time, but once I got to high school and realized science was not my strong suit, those dreams flew swiftly out the window. Being a lawyer was the next best option; I enjoyed reading and writing, and history was my best subject. And, as my parents would tell you without hesitation, I could pick an argument with anyone over anything, and I usually won. I presented many cases to my parents over the years, from bedroom renovations to puppies, and everything in between.\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 15, Paul is making a case for the resurrection of the dead. Paul accuses some of the Corinthians of saying there is no resurrection of the dead: that is, once Christians die, they will not be raised with Christ. Paul then argues that if they believe in the resurrection of Christ, then they must also believe in the resurrection of the dead. Paul’s argument is not to prove that Christians will be raised in resurrection with Christ, but to say that the people who deny the resurrection of the dead are wrong. His argument forces the Corinthians to come to the realization that there is, in fact, hope for the future resurrection of those who believe in Christ.\n\nPaul’s argument to the Corinthians is fit for a trial court. He’s making them decide whether or not they actually believe what they say they do. Paul reminds the Corinthians that “Christ died for our sins… that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15:3-4). Paul challenges the Corinthian church to remember what they say they believe, because if those things are not true, then all of their proclamations are in vain.\n\nThis passage is one that is read often at funerals and memorial services of loved ones who have passed away. It’s comforting to think about the resurrection in the face of death. It grounds us, reminds us of who we are and where our true home lies.\n\nToday, let this passage remind you of the power and might of a God who sent His Son to die for us, and raised Him on the third day so that we, too, might live with Him in eternal resurrection. We should put our faith and our hope in this God, the God who “raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavens” (Ephesians 2:6). Our citizenship does not belong here on earth, but to the new heavens and new earth that come with the resurrection. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 15:20-58, Philippians 1:12, 1 Thessalonians 4:17\n\nTexans are obsessed with our state flower, the bluebonnet. Bluebonnets are wildflowers that bloom in early spring. For several weeks each season, they line our interstates and take over our fields. They are a sudden flower, nowhere to be seen for months and months and then, suddenly, they are everywhere. They don’t space out their arrival. It feels like they decide to bloom all at once. And overnight, Texas is a sea of blue.\n\nThis is why I was surprised to learn that if you want to plant bluebonnets to bloom in the spring, experts suggest planting the seeds in late summer or early fall. Though it looks like the wildflowers appear overnight, they are actually growing beneath the soil for months.\n\nI thought of the bluebonnets while reading Paul’s words in 1 Corinthians 15, when he compares our resurrection to seeds being sown: “So it is with the resurrection of the dead: Sown in corruption, raised in incorruption; sown in dishonor, raised in glory; sown in weakness, raised in power; sown a natural body, raised a spiritual body” (vv. 42-44). In the resurrection, we will be completely transformed, and Paul says this change will happen suddenly, “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye” (vv. 51–52).  \n\nMy temptation when reading these words is to look forward to the change to come, and ignore my need to change now. Great, I think, in the end when I am resurrected, all will be well. I will be the person I was made to be. I, and the entire world, will be restored and redeemed.\n\nBut the last verse of this chapter suggests another way to think about this sudden change. Paul says, “Therefore, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the Lord’s work, knowing that your labor in the Lord is not in vain” (v.58).\n\nThe instruction isn’t, “Therefore, sit back and relax, it’ll all be okay in the end.” The instruction is, “Therefore keep working, steadfastly, immovably, excelling at the Lord’s work because none of this is in vain.” The change to come will seem sudden, but really, just as the bluebonnet is sown in fall to bloom in spring, we will have been working toward change all along.\n\nThis is incredibly convicting for me. This is incredibly convicting for the church. We have been sown, and now we must do the hard work of growing. This is the Lord’s work: we care for the poor. We work toward reconciliation. We confess. We repent. We forgive. And we do all of this now because we know it is not in vain. What the Lord plants, He will grow. The work He begins, He will complete (Philippians 1:6).\n\nSo today, may we look toward our final resurrection, made possible through the resurrection of Christ, with great hope. But let’s not allow our hope for the future to distract us from the work at hand. There is much to do. Therefore, let’s be steadfast, immovable, and excel at the Lord’s work on earth, knowing we may not see all the fruit of our labor now, but all will be in bloom when the trumpet sounds.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Corinthians 16:1-21, Leviticus 23:15-22, Deuteronomy 31:6-8\n\nAlmost everybody works in some way. Whether we’re raising kids, conducting high-powered business meetings, teaching in a classroom, or polishing nails at the local salon, most folks know what it’s like to have a job. You know what’s frustrating, though? Doing a ton of work, but having no idea what’s expected of you. This is what the apostle Paul is trying to avoid in his letters to the Corinthian church. \n\nThe Corinthian church was multicultural, multiethnic, and socioeconomically diverse. It seems the only thing everyone in this group of folks had in common was their decision to follow Jesus. I’m guessing the members of this community had their work cut out for them! Not only were they charged with the tasks of being the salt of the earth and the light of the world, but they also had to figure out how to live and work together in order to present themselves to Christ and to the world as a unified body—not an easy undertaking.\n\nPaul is aware of this, and so, in a way, the book of 1 Corinthians serves as a job description for the early Church. The apostle makes clear what is expected of the community of believers who bear the name of Jesus Christ, and in the very last chapter, he closes with highlighting three growth areas for the Corinthian church. \n\nGenerosity. Paul is encouraging this church to share liberally from their financial resources to support the church in Jerusalem, which was experiencing difficult times. Note this: he didn’t ask the Corinthian church as an institution to support the Jerusalem church, but instead asked each person to set aside a portion of their income for the cause, every week. And if you earned a higher income, you were expected to give more.\n\nHumility. Paul acknowledges four leaders who should be honored because of their work in the Lord. For Paul, honor and submission go hand in hand; you honor others by submitting your will to theirs. \n\nLove. Paul commands, “Do everything in love” (v. 14). The motive for every word and every action should be love. It’s love that compels Paul to labor for the sake of the gospel, and it’s love that prompted him to write this letter to the Corinthian church in the first place.\n\nGenerosity, humility, and love. What do these three have in common? They are major attributes of Jesus Christ, the common denominator in the Church. Jesus was generous to humankind, becoming poor so that we could become rich. He humbled Himself by obeying the Father, even to the point of death. Jesus’ love was so great that He laid down His life for those who were His enemies. \n\nThis is good news for us! Just like the Corinthians, working as a unified Church is tough. But thanks be to God that we’ve got clear expectations lined out for us in God’s Word. And not only that—we have a perfect example in Jesus Christ, who sent the Holy Spirit to empower us to be the people God has called us to be.\n\n",

Although I live in an entirely different state, hours away, I was under the impression that my mom and dad would live in the house I grew up in for the rest of their lives, tending to my childhood belongings and keeping our memories safe. But ultimately, that wasn’t the best plan for them, and while I understood that, I didn’t want to accept it.\n\nAll I could think about was how their new house wouldn’t have the staircase I’d walked down while wearing my high school prom dress, the room where my brother learned to play the trumpet, or the end of the driveway where the school bus used to wait for us. It wouldn’t have a hidden nail polish stain on the bedroom carpet, or our cat’s favorite spots to lie in the sun. It wouldn’t have neighbors who stopped by on birthdays or just because, and it certainly wouldn’t have an address already known by heart.\n\nAnd yet, after the moving trucks had gone and the boxes had been unpacked, I visited my parents’ new house and was surprised to find it less empty than I’d imagined. Inside, I was greeted by a hallway of family photographs, the scent of my favorite brownies wafting through the air from the kitchen, and the cat snuggled up and basking in the sunlight. Sometimes, comfort comes with us. God’s presence always does, that’s for sure.\n\nMany times, it’s easy to forget that we don’t face suffering alone the way Christ did. Because of His sacrifice, we get pain and comfort in equal proportion, not one without the other. “For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so also through Christ our comfort overflows” (2 Corinthians 1:5).\n\nSuffering may bring us to new places we’d never choose to go, but God’s comfort promises to follow. It may not take away all the pain or change the situation entirely, but it does something even more significant: it reveals to us God’s heart for His people, His love for us. He didn’t want us to know the wrath of pain without knowing the eternal promise of its relief. Comfort reminds us of the end game of eternity. It acknowledges God’s power and ultimate plan to set things right again.\n\nMay God’s comfort be the thing to rearrange our afflictions and lift us to joy. May the promises of His tenderness meet us in our griefs and sorrows, disappointments and not-yets. May the kindness of His character find us and make even darkness an occasion to seek light. And may we feel at home and at rest in His comforting presence. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Sinner Forgiven",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 2:5-17, Matthew 6:14-15, Colossians 3:12-17\n\nFor weeks, I have grappled with these passages in 2 Corinthians. Forgiveness is such a complicated, messy, and integral part of the Christian faith. And if I’m honest, I don’t know if I understand how it works, or whether I’m practicing it well in my life. \n\nWhen I really let myself think about forgiveness, it touches raw nerves. It calls up painful memories of the times I’ve been hurt, and the times I’ve done the hurting. And that doesn’t feel good. In fact, I’d rather just forget about those parts of my life and move on. \n\nBut contrary to popular belief, Jesus does not call us to “forgive and forget.” Christian forgiveness does not require rose-colored glasses or some “spiritual” version of denial. What it does require is faith that if Jesus has carried the weight of our sin, He can also carry the weight of our wounds.\n\nGod doesn’t minimize our offenses. He doesn’t wave them away with a magic wand of denial. Nor does He offer empty cop-outs. Instead, He enacted an eternal, and costly, plan to set things right. \n\nThe God-man of great sorrow, Jesus, was well acquainted with the evil of this world (Isaiah 53:3), and He refused to ignore it. Instead, He chose to bear the debt on His own back. Knowing that God could not be in the presence of unholy people, Jesus put on our unholiness and gave us His perfect record in return. The sin was heavy, and Jesus carried it, though He didn’t resent us while carrying the cross. He didn’t wait for us to ask Him to do it, either. He forgave us before we even knew we needed forgiveness—because He loved us first. \n\nAs impossible as it sometimes feels, we are called to emulate Christ. “For to God we are the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing” (2 Corinthians 2:15). Still, forgiveness is not easy. It does not eliminate pain. Forgiveness is an active, voluntary choice to carry the weight of someone else’s sin. It does not guarantee that we will be reconciled to that person, nor that the relationship will ever be the same. Forgiveness says, “You no longer have to make up for what you did to me. I will carry the cost.”\n\nBut I’m not Jesus. So even my ability to forgive is imperfect. One of Jesus’ disciples once asked whether it was fair to forgive someone seven times, and Jesus replied,\n\n“I tell you, not as many as seven… but seventy times seven” (Matthew 18:22).\n\nI don’t believe that is a call to be abused over and over again by the same person. In my life, that has meant actively forgiving someone for the same crime, even as I find myself feeling resentful again. When the bitterness returns, I can choose to let that old wound fester, or I can put on the salve of forgiveness. There may still be a scar, but I am no longer keeping the wound open in order to prove how much I’ve been hurt. \n\nWhen forgiveness is hard, faith reminds me to focus less on what someone did to me, and more on what Jesus did for me. It is in that posture of humility that I can bring my wounds and my sins back to the feet of Jesus. It is there that He reminds me that even when my suffering feels heavy, He is the one who ultimately carries it all.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 3:1-18, Jeremiah 31:31-34, 1 John 3:2\n\nAs someone whose greatest love language is words of affirmation, handwritten letters are a huge deal to me. My mom put a note in my lunchbox every day when I was growing up. My friends and family wrote letters to me before I left to study abroad for a semester. And my best friend knows that the quickest way to brighten my day is a quick note delivered with a fresh cup of coffee. I keep a box of letters from loved ones on my desk to read when I’m having a hard day. They have brought me encouragement in my darkest moments, reminding me that I am loved and cherished.\n\nIn the days of the early Church, letters served an even greater purpose than they do now. Letters functioned similarly to recommendation letters written for employment or educational purposes; they were vouchers for people when they entered into new churches and new communities. \n\nWhen I was applying for graduate school last spring, I toiled over choosing the professors and mentors who I would ask to write my recommendation letters. I wanted to make sure they had the best impression of me. I wanted to be confident I was worthy of their recommendation, that the letters they sent to admissions offices would include the best version of me I could present. And so I sent those professors my most stacked resume and the best version of my application essays. In short, I wanted to prove I was good enough—both to the people writing my recommendation letters, and to the people who would read them.\n\nWhen Paul tells the Corinthians that they are Christ’s living letters, he’s reminding them of their identity as the people of God. He’s reminding them of who they are, of their identity as the body of Christ. He’s reminding them that the Spirit of God has written the law of love on their hearts, doing away with the old covenant and making way for a brand new one: the covenant they can be part of because of Christ Jesus. Our recommendations and our accolades don’t hold any weight in the new covenant because “our adequacy is from God” (2 Corinthians 3:5). Our worth and our confidence are in Christ Jesus—not in ourselves, nor in the things that are praised by others.\n\nWe, too, are able to be a part of this new covenant—the covenant that replaced the law of Moses and gave us the ability to act in boldness. This covenant gives us life, hope, and freedom.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 4:1-18, Romans 6:5-7, 2 Timothy 4:3\n\nMy husband and I have a saying in our home, “Fidelity (or faithfulness) to the Word of God and not to an outcome.” We say it to one another and to others often, because the truth is we are often more interested in controlling the outcome of a situation than we are in abiding by the Word of God. \n\nWe want success.\nWe want freedom.\nWe want peace.\nWe want “the scoop.”\nWe want to be seen rightly.\nWe want to defend our actions.\nWe want time to ourselves.\nWe don’t want to confront sin.\nWe don’t want to do hard things.\nWe don’t want to be held responsible.\n\nHow then, we usually find ourselves asking, can we get the desired outcome out of any situation? \n\nI don’t think we’re alone in this. It’s human nature to spin the story, cast blame, make excuses. From the beginning of time, cunning words have been practiced and God’s words have been tampered with (Genesis 3). All it takes is a cursory glance around at the state of the Church, the government, family, and my own heart to see the practice of cunning words abounding and God’s Word still being tampered with. We are all playing chess with people, circumstances, God’s Word, and His timing—trying to get the outcome we desire or avoid the outcome we don’t want. \n\nWithin today’s passage, this is what strikes me most about Paul’s words to the Corinthians: “For we are not proclaiming ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for [Jesus’] sake” (2 Corinthians 4:5). The main thing we’re doing when we try to control the outcome, hide the truth, and circumvent the hard things, is proclaim our own glory and significance. We’re trying to make ourselves look good, look right (or at least less wrong). We’re trying to raise ourselves in the estimation of others. \n\nBut look again at what Paul tells the Corinthians: “God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of the darkness,’ has shown in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus” (v. 6). This is a powerful picture, if we pay attention. \n\nGod’s glory (Christ Jesus) shines into our hearts (darkened by sin and brokenness), giving us the light of knowledge. As we’re tying ourselves into knots trying to control the narrative and the outcome, God is shining the light of Jesus into our dark hearts and giving us knowledge, the very thing we lack. (For if we had it, there would be no need to feel anxious about outcomes, because we’d always make the perfect decision.) And what knowledge is this? Look back to the beginning of the chapter: \n\n“Therefore, since we have this ministry because we were shown mercy, we do not give up. Instead, we have renounced secret and shameful things, not acting deceitfully or distorting the word of God, but commending ourselves before God to everyone’s conscience by an open display of the truth” (vv. 1–2). \n\nDo you want to walk in all of life with a good outcome? Do you want to be above reproach? A worshiper of the one true God? A humble, faithful, kind, gentle person? Let the light of Christ Jesus shine on your darkened heart, the one more prone to seeking out its own way than making way for God. And, having walked faithfully and according to God’s Word, let others see the outcomes in your life as they truly are—as someone holding fast to God’s truth, not their own, whose heart is alight with Christ Jesus—even if the outcomes of your life look foolish to the world. Your fidelity is to His Word and His will first.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 5:1-6:2, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Titus 2:11-14\n\nLast summer, we ventured out west where we spent about a week sleeping in a tent with our five children. Driving from Washington back home to Tennessee, we passed the base of Mt. Rainer, the Grand Tetons, and other increasingly brave and out-of-the-way places. As we were driving through the Yakima Valley one evening, we realized it was late and getting dark, and we hadn’t settled on a place to set up camp for the night. And so we stopped along the Naches River on an abandoned stretch of highway with tall hills on both sides of the camp.\n\nBy this point we had a travel system in place; everyone knew their job, so we all worked together quickly to set up our tent. Once we’d settled in, we realized we were not alone. Just a stone’s throw away, tucked behind the sagebrush, cooking hot dogs over a fire, was Frank. I helped the kids play/bathe in the river and helped them to some supper, while my husband, Caleb, introduced himself. Frank lived in his tent full-time and had a lot of really good ideas for long-term, electricity-free refrigeration. We exchanged kindnesses and small gifts, and fell asleep in our respective tents. For us, that night was the bravest, most rugged camping we’d ever logged. But for Frank, it was just a Tuesday. \n\nI love the hope that Paul gives us in this passage from 2 Corinthians, because no matter how comfortable or uncomfortable we are in our earthly tents, they will all be packed up and folded away someday. Because of Jesus, this is not our home. The Father “made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:21).\n\nPaul acknowledges that we are groaning in our earthly bodies, some of us living with pain that won’t go away until Jesus comes. Some of us carrying a weight of sadness that makes us long to go home. No matter what kind of tent we are living in, it will be destroyed.\n\nThe thought of my own death fills me with concern for my children. But setting that hefty thought aside and clinging to the truth Paul is teaching in this passage, I see that our earthly death means the ending of a short, uncomfortable camping trip, and the joy and relief of finally going home—where things are clean and warm and beautiful, and there’s good food and good company. But we have never seen it. So we hold on to our tents, even though they are fraying and growing holes and starting to let the rain in. These tents are awesome, don’t get me wrong. But they are not the final stop. In the meantime, Paul says, we sit in our tents and we groan.\n\nBut Paul exhorts us, “So we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord” (2 Corinthians 5:6). While we are still here on earth in these awesome and leaky bodies, biding our time, we have the mighty hope of our future eternal home with Christ. During these camping days, we aim to be pleasing to Him and long for the day when He will finally bring us home.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 6:3-7:1, Ezekiel 37:26-28, Philippians 2:12-13\n\nSalt and light, stewards and servants—these are among the descriptors used to define the people of God. Like so much about faith, they feel like square pegs that refuse to be shoved into the round holes of the world’s expectations. \n\nAnd yet, these are more than pretty platitudes. Church, this is who we are. This is how God’s Word calls us to live. Having our paradigm for identity and success shifted so radically by the gospel can feel disorienting. There’s a temptation to use all the wrong litmus tests to gauge if we’re getting it right. In our homes and our churches, our culture and our community, how can we know if we’re building a ministry without fault? If success cannot be measured in accolades and “Atta girls!”, what rewards are given to faithful servants? These questions make me grateful that Paul provides us with a new set of gold stars to aspire to from today’s reading in 2 Corinthians 6. And they are: great endurance, purity, truthful speech, and the power of God (vv. 4, 6-7).\n\nPaul identified these as hallmarks of a ministry no one could fault (v. 3). He surely knew a thing or two about measuring ministry successes all wrong. His former colleagues in the religious elite considered his ministry a heresy. His fellow Christ-followers often questioned his methodology. Even his co-laborers questioned his decision-making on occasion. Yet, we find in Paul a minister unmoved. Though still sinful, Paul was steadfast. Paul knew why he ministered (to spread the gospel), and he knew how to measure his success. This, friends, is liberation. \n\nWe, too, are free to stop measuring our success as Christian parents by how our children behave in any given moment. We are free to stop considering the wishes and whims of culture as an indicator of the Church’s effectiveness. We are empowered to use our gifts to share the gospel and build up the body of Christ without fretting if no one seems to notice. We are set free from the doubt that inevitably comes when we worry God has our ministry under a microscope. \n\nSince none of this can be measured by human standards, we are free to throw out the measuring stick altogether. When we look to God alone to reward our faithful service, we find that He is the true reward. “For it is God who is working in you both to will and to work according to his good purpose” (Philippians 2:13). \n\nThe invitation Christ extended from the cross must bleed over into our concept of successful ministry. Christ does all the heavy-lifting, and thus He deserves every iota of glory. Our job is so simple in return. We keep serving, never tiring of doing good. We keep clinging to God’s Word, refusing to let other voices pollute the truth we know. We keep telling the truth, again and again and again. We keep bragging on our weaknesses, confident in how they bend the spotlight away from us and toward the indisputable power of God. \n\nSuccessful ministry rarely looks like we think it should. Paul reminds us that this, too, is grace.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 7:2-16, Lamentations 3:19-24, Acts 3:19-20\n\nHave you ever been confronted by somebody when you knew you were in the wrong? As a counselor, there have been many times when I’ve witnessed a spouse calling out their partner for some glaring, painful sin. When this happens, I’ve consistently seen one of two reactions take place: ownership or defensiveness. It’s hard to hear the truth about ourselves. To not only stare our failure in the face, but also have somebody else observe it too, can feel shameful. \n\nWhether we respond with ownership or defensiveness is a matter of the heart. Of course, all of this is presuming the confrontation takes place in a godly manner. I’m not talking about unhealthy conflict or persecution that is neither godly nor loving. But when our flaws are confronted or even rebuked in love, as Paul did with the Corinthians, how we respond shows what we believe about the gospel. Are we going to allow the Spirit to convict our hearts, or are we going to cover our ears and point the blame elsewhere?\n\nWhile it’s scary to admit we don’t have it all together, when we do acknowledge our sin we can turn toward Jesus in repentance and know we are forgiven. When our sin saddens us, we experience “godly grief,” which “produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, but worldly grief produces death” (2 Corinthian 7:10). \n\nThis is a heart pain we will never regret. If we’re not torn up by our brokenness, we won’t understand how badly we need to be saved from ourselves. As Jesus said, “It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners” (Mark 2:17).\n\nIf we’re honest, it’s exhausting, trying to “manage” our sin and remain pure in our own strength. Luckily, it’s okay to admit we’re a mess! If we didn’t have a forgiving God, that would be a different story. But Scripture tells us that “if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9). Because Jesus’ sacrificial blood covers us so completely, the Father will never again look on us with anything but steadfast, unwavering love.\n\nWe can take responsibility for our wrongdoing because our God is outlandishly gracious. Of course, we shouldn’t abuse the Lord’s grace by purposely sinning (Romans 6:1–4). But when we do fail, we can remember the story of the prodigal son returning home and his forgiving father running toward him, arms opened wide to welcome him (Luke 15:20).\n\nIn the same way, our Father in heaven runs to embrace His returning daughters. When the Spirit convicts our hearts, we ought to lean in to that godly grief with nothing to fear in Christ. Our sins are already forgiven in the finished work of Jesus. When we turn to God in repentance, we are returning our gaze back to the One who longs to be gracious to us and show us compassion, over and over again (Isaiah 30:18).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 8:1-24, John 1:1-3, Philippians 2:4-11\n\nI like to think I’m a generous person.\n\nI happily give to people and causes that matter to me. My family supports campus ministers, international children’s relief organizations, and our local church. We donate stuff we don’t want or use anymore. We pat ourselves on the back, sometimes share on social media, and then go on our merry way. It doesn’t hurt, and it makes us feel good. But are we generous? \n\nHere’s what we really are: comfortable givers. \n\nPaul is writing to comfortable givers in this chapter of 2 Corinthians. He is fundraising for the Jerusalem fund, a task he mentions throughout his letters as he travels and writes to various Gentile churches. Specifically, he is asking Gentiles (non-Jewish converts to Christianity) to send money for the poor in Jerusalem (likely Jews), which Paul references in Acts 24:17. \n\nIn 2 Corinthians 8, Paul tells the wealthy Corinthians about the overflowing generosity of the poor Macedonians for the Jerusalem fund. “They begged us earnestly for the privilege of sharing in the ministry to the saints,” he writes of the Macedonians’ eagerness to give (v. 4). \n\nIn essence, Paul is describing the Macedonians with an unnatural equation: severe trial + affliction + extreme poverty = abundant joy + wealth of generosity. \n\nThis equation can only be true in the math of mercy. Paul has no shame about telling the Corinthians how generously the Macedonians have given, and that he expects them to do the same. He is asking them for money—and a lot of it—using words like “surplus” and “generous.” \n\nBut here’s why it seems Paul isn’t afraid to ask for money, why he is bold in telling the Corinthians just how much the Macedonians sacrificed to give: because we learn to give from the great giver Himself, Jesus. Paul is reminding the Corinthians—and us—that when we believe in Jesus, our hearts are molded in the shape of His. “For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: Though he was rich, for your sake he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich” (2 Corinthians 8:9).\n\nWe love because Jesus loved us first (1 John 4:19). We give because Jesus gave everything for us and to us. And so we don’t just give money; we give ourselves. This can look like radical or everyday hospitality—acts of service on a grand, public scale, or little ones like changing the millionth diaper or washing yet another dish, simply so someone else doesn’t have to. \n\nGenerosity isn’t a series of acts or financial decisions. Generosity is a posture, a way of living in the way of Christ. Generosity is worship, an act done in response to the ultimate generosity of our living King Jesus. We don’t give or act generously to feel good or to check a box. We give to respond to Jesus. We give to break our hearts of their grip on material, physical comfort and let them reset in the shape of Jesus’ perfectly generous heart. \n\nWe live in a world of self-care and me-time and “treat yo-self.” We are entitled to comfort, or so we believe. When the Bible’s call to radical generosity rubs up against our idol of comfort, it should chafe a little. As members of Christ’s church, we’re called to be more than just comfortable givers. We look to Jesus and we see everything poured out for us. And becoming like Him, as we endeavor to “adopt the same attitude as that of Christ Jesus” (Philippians 2:5), means pouring everything out for Him.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Motivations for Giving",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 9:1-15, Psalm 126:1-6, Hosea 10:12\n\n“Jesus talked about money more than any other topic!”\n\nGrowing up, my dad issued this statement every time he spoke about stewardship. I have no idea if he was actually right—I have never tallied up the passages myself—but he was certainly on to something. Jesus was, without a doubt, concerned about our possessions. Between His parables and His one-on-one interactions, Jesus often addressed wealth, greed, investment, and stewardship. Whatever the precise frequency may have been, Jesus talked about money a lot.   \n\nIn 2 Corinthians 9, Paul seems to pick up where Jesus left off. He is bold and unashamed in instructing the Corinthians to give. His tone is straightforward, and He seems totally unembarrassed by the indelicate topic of money. \n\nThe combined witnesses of Jesus and Paul remind us of an oft overlooked truth: how we talk about money matters. God doesn’t simply want us to give; He wants us to do it for the right reasons, and to think about our finances in a holy way. Along those lines, Jesus and Paul both steer us away from two common errors in our language about finances. \n\nThe first error is thinking of our finances as private. When it comes to money, many of us have a hands-off approach; we don’t want to be told what to do with it. I have heard stories of church attendees walking out of the service, never to return again, simply because the sermon was about stewardship. Money is a touchy subject, and as a result, pastors can be skittish about discussing it. Some even apologize to their congregations on the rare occasion that they do address finances.  \n\nPaul, on the other hand, is unapologetic. He does not mince words when he warns, “Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly,” (v. 6). Based on passages like this one, it’s impossible to read Scripture and conclude that our money is nobody else’s business. God is not ambivalent about our wealth, but instead lays claim to it, so we cannot balk when our church community invites us to be generous.\n\nThe second error in our thinking about money is that of the prosperity gospel. This error gives inordinate attention to wealth, and it worships a transactional god whose grace is something we earn. The prosperity gospel interprets Paul’s words in a materialistic way, promising that if you give your money away, you are guaranteed to make much more in return.\n\nPaul’s words in 2 Corinthians 9 seem especially vulnerable to the distortion of prosperity preaching, since he promises “whoever sows generously will reap generously” (v. 6). However, what distinguishes Paul’s message from the prosperity gospel is motivation. The prosperity gospel is motivated by material gain, whereas the “cheerful giving” that honors Christ is motivated by gratitude. Put another way, we express our gratitude to God by being generous with others, just as He is generous with us. \n\nWhat is interesting about these two errors is that they produce the opposite effect. One discourages us from talking about money, while the other over-emphasizes it. But Scripture offers a third option. We can and should talk about money, but in the right way and for the right purpose: to the glory of God, the love of others, and the good of the world. \n\nIn truth, our finances are really not our own. They are God’s resources, which we are called to steward well. “And God is able to make every grace overflow to [us], so that in every way, always having everything [we] need, [we] may excel in every good work” unto to Him and for His glory (v. 8).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 10:1-18, Jeremiah 9:23-24, Ephesians 2:8-9\n\nMany of us who engage with social media have seen it: folks emboldened by relative anonymity in the virtual world of the internet, or by the perceived distance from those with whom they interact. On social media a person can have a mouthful of opinionated vitriol to spew, but face-to-face they’re silent as a lamb. Those folks have what kids today call “Twitter fingers” (derivative of the phrase “trigger fingers”), a term used to describe someone who is always at-the-ready to take a proverbial “shot” at someone else on social media, while hiding behind an online persona or handle.\n\nI wonder if the Corinthians church thought Paul was guilty of the same kind of communication. His letters to them are certainly stern and authoritative, but in person, the apostle seems a good bit more tame. But Paul doesn’t take their accusations lying down. In 2 Corinthians 10, he fires back at the Corinthians’ claims, saying they are off-base because they are judging strength and boldness in the same way the world does. The world expects strength and authority to manifest as brute force or powerful, charming speech, but Paul argues that those things are inferior to the spiritual authority he’s been given in Christ. The apostle’s strength and authority are waging war in the spiritual realm—where the real work is done.  \n\nPaul’s words are strong, and they should be! He should speak as strongly as possible because he’s asserting that his authority comes from the Lord! It was by God’s power that Paul was even able to evangelize and establish the Corinthian church in the first place. It was because of the Lord’s grace that Paul had the strength, wisdom, and patience to have a shepherding presence for their community. \n\nThe Corinthian church had it all wrong. They thought Paul couldn’t support such bold words with action, and therefore, his spiritual authority shouldn’t be taken seriously. In truth, they should’ve been more eager to submit to his leadership because his authority was manifested with demonstrations of spiritual power. In fact, their own Christian lives were the fruit of Paul’s boldness and authority.\n\nFriends, I think the same is true of us. Yes, we’re supposed to be marked by our meekness and gentleness and patience, but let’s not mistake those characteristics for weakness. On the contrary, when we’ve cultivated the fruit of the Spirit of God, we are actually reflecting the God of heaven and earth more accurately. We don’t have to be the best speaker, the most outgoing, or the smartest person in the room to move and act in the power of the Spirit. I’d argue that the less emphasis we put on our own strength to win the favor of people, the more we rely on the Spirit of God to empower us to be the people God has called us to be. That way, whenever victory is won, all glory goes to God! \n\nSo be encouraged, and don’t worry about impressing others. Let us boast in the power of God instead, which lives in each one of us (2 Corinthians 10:17). May we be quick to boast of knowing Him, enjoying Him, being found in Him, and loved by Him (Jeremiah 9:24).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Wynter Pitts\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 11:1-33, John 3:29, Revelation 19:7-8\n\nStrong. It’s not a word I would typically use to describe myself in the classic sense. I’m rather small and hold limited muscle on my frame. I don’t exercise intensely, and frankly, I prefer rest and relaxation to exercise and exertion. What’s true of me physically is mirrored in my mental life. I’m a go-with-the-flow kind of girl with just enough “go” to make things happen, if needed. Striving and goal-setting aren’t ideas that get me too excited, and they definitely aren’t words that come out of my mouth with joy. \n\nWhen I’m operating at my best, I’m moving methodically, without too much urgency and typically without any real sense of the final destination. I prefer to envision the next stop along the path. And that is why it is absolutely hilarious when I’m asked, often, how I’ve accomplished what I’ve accomplished.  \n\nOver the years, I’ve met with success professionally. I’m now asked to speak and share my story of perceived success and strength with others. But what they are seeing isn’t me at all. They are witnessing the Lord’s hand in my life, and He has given me more strength than I could have ever imagined. God alone has grown and sustained the work in my life. At times it’s tempting to believe the hype myself and to focus on my accomplishments. Even to boast in them. But taking even a moment to dwell on these thoughts would be short-sighted and misguided.\n\nIn 2 Corinthians 11, Paul is sharing his temptation to do this very thing—to boast in his own strength. Some believed he was inferior to the “super apostles,” false prophets who were attacking him in order to discredit the gospel of grace Paul was preaching. \n\nIn a rebuttal of sorts, Paul begins to share his resume: his status as both an Israelite and servant of Jesus, whose accomplishments and suffering for the cause of Christ would supersede most anyone’s in his time and in ours. He brings up his shipwreck, his floggings, and the dangers he endured for the sake of the gospel. But just when you think he’s going to give the final uppercut, he flips the script and says:\n\nIf boasting is necessary, I will boast about my weaknesses. —2 Corinthians 11:30\n\nIn this chapter, Paul creatively reminds himself, the Corinthians, and us, that boasting of anyone or anything other than Jesus is foolish. Any boasting we partake in should point to God’s power and grace. Paul’s perspective brought him back to gratitude for our Savior. Finding Jesus in our weaknesses should do the very same thing for us. All glory and all praise belong to Him alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 12:1-21, Mark 14:32-36, Philippians 4:10-13\n\nIt was just a common cold, then an infection, and then another infection from the antibiotics the doctors had given me to fight the first infection. Then, after being in bed for a week, my lower back started to hurt. To add insult to injury, I cracked one of my molars on a seed in my bread, and ended up having to get a root canal. For four weeks it was one thing after another. I don’t get sick often, so this debilitating month was like an object lesson in the absolute frailty of my body. Nothing was really related to anything else; it was just a perfect cluster of unfortunate events all smashed up against one another. \n\nI don’t know about you, but I can manage a simple cold. I can even manage a tweaked back. But when all the world seems to conspire against me when I simply get out of bed, eat anything harder than yogurt, or I’m on my third round of antibiotics in a month—well, I begin to despair. In that moment, I couldn’t remember what it felt like to be well, let alone remember what it felt like to be cheerful or whole or able to manage anything. I felt like a walking mistake.\n\nHave you ever felt like that? \n\nMaybe it’s not physical for you; maybe it’s emotional. Or maybe it is physical, but to an extent that makes my month of maladies seem like a walk in the park. Perhaps it’s mental or spiritual—I don’t know. But I do know that sometimes God’s grace does not feel sufficient for my weakness. Nothing about me, or Him for that matter, seems sufficient in days and weeks and months like these. \n\nYet, in 2 Corinthians 12, Paul lists the weaknesses in which he finds contentment: insults, hardships, persecution, and calamities, not to mention the thorn in his flesh God hasn’t removed. Paul is not saying these things don’t exist or that they aren’t hard. He isn’t putting on a brave face or being courageous in the midst of difficulty. He’s not even saying it’s okay to simply accept the thorn as it is. No, he begs God to remove it. But, in the midst of all this very real pain and difficulty, Paul’s contentment is not in his ability to weather the storm, bear the pain, or be brave. His contentment is in the sufficiency of God’s grace. \n\nWhen I’m struggling with anything, I want to find contentment in God’s sovereign ability to change everything in an instant, to heal what is broken right now, to right what is wrong. What I don’t want to be contented with is simply walking through the difficulty—be it physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual—in the knowledge that His grace is sufficient, that He is bearing this with me, and He hears me. And even if He hasn’t answered my prayer according to my wishes, He is still sufficient for me in my weakness, emptiness, pain, and sorrow. \n\nPaul’s words to the Corinthians in this passage remind me that sometimes God doesn’t change our circumstances, not one bit. But He does change our hearts in the midst of everything, making us more like Him. Jesus’ words to Paul and to the Corinthians are a promise to us as well: \n\n“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is perfected in weakness.” —2 Corinthians 12:9\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Corinthians 13:1-13, John 15:1-8, Colossians 1:9-12\n\nThink about the words you would use to describe the Church today. \n\nWhen Paul wrote his letters to the Corinthian church, he didn’t know what the Church today would look like. Designations like Catholic and Protestant, Reformed and Arminian, even conservative and liberal, didn’t exist. And yet, in the newly formed Church of Paul’s day, they still needed to pursue unity. Dissension fractured the new body of believers, much as it has for centuries. The study of Church history is the study of fractions, disjointed parts that make a whole. \n\nThe last chapter of 2 Corinthians is Paul’s plea to his Corinthian brothers and sisters. A brief review of Paul’s relationship with the church at Corinth might be helpful here as we close our study of both letters. \n\nFirst Corinthians is Paul’s instruction manual to Corinth. He clarifies new Christian traditions and social positions (everything from spiritual gifts to marriage to the Lord’s Supper). Factions in the church had begun to form around different interpretations of these traditions. Church leaders who opposed Paul began to gain traction around their interpretations, and Paul responded with a strong letter of rebuke (which was lost). \n\nMany Corinthian believers responded well to Paul’s rebuke, and found sure footing again. But dissenting factions remained, and it is to these people that Paul addressed 2 Corinthians. Paul really puts himself out there in this letter. It is his apologetic for himself as a leader, but also for the cause of Christ. 2 Corinthians is emotional and strong, like the closing arguments of a political debate or a courtroom drama. \n\nMany scholars and commentaries refer to 2 Corinthians as Paul’s apologia pro vita sua, a latin phrase which means “a defense of one’s life.” He defends himself, he defends the body of Christ, and he defends the faith. Church unity is one of Paul’s soapboxes. He returns to it over and over, and in his closing statements to the Corinthians, he says this: \n\nAim for restoration, comfort one another, agree with one another, live in peace. —2 Corinthians 13:11\n\nRestoration, comfort, agreeableness, peace—as the body of Christ, Paul calls us to these things in this important epistle. Can you imagine if those words described the Church today, let alone the Church throughout history? \n\nHere’s what I believe about the Church, in a rather church-y metaphor. When you look at a piece of stained glass, you see one of two things first. You can see the whole beautiful picture, or you can see the hundreds or thousands of smaller pieces of glass. All of those different pieces of glass have a purpose; they bring a unique color, perspective, shape, or function to the whole piece of art. But the primary goal of all of those little pieces is to come together to present one beautiful message to its audience. \n\nUntil Christ returns, the Church will always be made up of thousands of pieces, expressions, or denominations. Each one brings something different to the body, yet all too often, we err on the side of contentiousness, distrust, or outright anger toward those other parts of the body. But our prayer should always be, as Paul’s was, that we present a mature, unified picture of the body of Christ, being of the same mind, at peace with one another and with God. In this way, we will display the glory and the heart of our King, Jesus Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nYesterday I went to visit my husband at his office–a newly constructed, all-glass-exterior building with marble floors and a sense of importance that seemed to demand awkward elevator silence, especially as I stood there with my out-of-place bag of ice cream from the shop across the street. \n\nI stepped out of the elevator and onto his floor, greeted by a kind receptionist who asked me to fill out a form on the tablet on her desk. It asked my name and then for my “host.” I typed in my husband’s name, and out popped a nametag: my name, followed by my host’s. My entrance into the building was guaranteed by his name.\n\nWhen Paul opens his letter to the Galatians, he goes through the same practice: “Paul, an apostle—not from men or by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead” (Galatians 1:1). Paul gains entrance into the church by his apostleship, dependent wholly on the person and work of Christ. He establishes his authority not by his own work or identity, but that of Jesus and His resurrection from the dead. \n\nPaul’s identity is the righteousness of Christ, and he repeats it throughout his letters. In his first letter to the Corinthians, he writes, “By the grace of God I am what I am” (1 Corinthians 15:10). In other letters, he introduces himself as “Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God” (2 Corinthians 1:1; Ephesians 1:1). And in Philippians chapter 1, the apostle refers to himself (as well as Timothy) as a servant of Christ Jesus. Paul fully embraces his new identity because it was given to him through faith in Christ, summing it up in this way: \n\n“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation;  the old has passed away, and see, the new has come!  Everything is from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation…  Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ…” —2 Corinthians 5:17–18, 20\n\nWhen Paul introduces himself, it is as though he is writing on one of those “Hello! My Name Is” stickers, one that says: “Hello! My name is Paul, and I belong to Christ. Everything I am is because of everything He did.” \n\nGalatians opens with a precious reminder and a challenge to remember: If we are in Christ, then we belong to God, and our identity is now bound up in Christ’s death and resurrection. We are sealed by His Spirit, waiting for the day Jesus returns. And we can trust Him, as the psalmist says, because He is our portion and our cup of blessing (Psalm 16:5). He holds my future in my hands, and the boundaries He has drawn around my life are good for me (v.6). \n\nThere are so many days I feel like a hundred pieces of a puzzle, strewn about on the floor just waiting to be put together. I am a wife, mother, employee, friend, volunteer coordinator, chef, sister, daughter, and also somehow sometimes my own person. It is deeply refreshing to remember the truth today—that I am Melanie, through Christ and by the Spirit, a servant of God. From that one identity, everything else should flow, all for His glory. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nMy daughter is in a truly delightful developmental stage that is characterized primarily by make-believe. She spins magical tales and recites them with flourish, keeping us entertained and amazed at her creativity and sense of humor. Some of her stories are easy to identify as play—I know empirically that, no matter how awesome it sounds, a seagull did, in fact, not land on her head and take a seashell that she had balanced there. \n\nBut some of her stories are harder to sift out truth from make-believe. Did she really swim without a life jacket at camp? Despite all the assurances that she would always have a Personal Flotation Device, it’s possible the counselor forgot. Maybe? Sussing out fact from fiction in these scenarios is hard, a delicate balance of demanding honesty and encouraging her storytelling, creativity, and play. \n\nWhen fiction is easy to identity, we delight in the power of story. When the line between truth and embellishment blurs, it is easy to believe first and question later. This is exactly Paul’s point in today’s part of the letter to Galatians. “I am amazed,” he writes, “that you are so quickly turning away from him who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—not that there is another gospel” (Galatians 1:6–7). Paul pulls no punches, telling them, “If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, a curse be on him!” (v.9). \n\nFurthermore, in 2 Corinthians, Paul admonishes, “For if a person comes and preaches another Jesus… you put up with it splendidly!” (2 Corinthians 11:4). The warning is two-fold: Stay true to the one true gospel and to Christ, and do not follow or teach a false gospel. \n\nMore often than not, the false gospels I am drawn to are not patently false at first glance. They dance on the line of biblical orthodoxy, skirting around it and often adding to it. A real Christian should live this way! they say, along with a pseudo-salvific claim to living out some expectation of modern life. Today’s false gospels bend Scripture, asking it to do or be something it’s not— adding to it to say something it does not say, or twisting what it actually does say. Which is exactly what the false teachers in Galatia were doing: adding a requirement of circumcision and following other Jewish laws to become a Christian.\n\nI actively fight against the temptation of false gospels every day by engaging in Scripture, the north star that always points us exclusively to Christ. Filtering out falsehoods and embellishments is the work of the Holy Spirit in my heart through the means of grace that is the Word of God. I am so thankful for it. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\n“The gospel is about transformation,” a friend of mine said while standing in my kitchen a few days ago. We were talking about a series of current events in the Church, sad and hard and deeply personal stories that call us to question our place in the current manifestation of God’s kingdom on earth, as all such stories tend to do. His statement hardly revolutionary, nor was it original, but I’ve found it’s been rolling around in my head ever since.\n\nWithout total transformation, a turning-inside-out by grace, it can be hard to stand firm in the faith. Every day it feels like I see another domino fall, the ripple effect of false gospels and faulty foundations. I say this full-well knowing that I could be next. Every day I pray for a deeper and greater transformation of my heart. Prayer, Scripture, Spirit—these are my lifelines to a new heart and a closer communion with God. Without them, I’m weak and tired. With them, I am transformed. \n\nAs we’ve read through Galatians 1 this week, Paul has been building a case for the rest of his letter using his own story of transformation. First, he identifies himself and his motivation: an apostle through Jesus. Second, he introduces his critique: the church in Galatia has fallen under the spell of a false gospel. Third, he qualifies his critique and message because of his own past and the total transformation he experienced through Jesus. \n\nPaul uses his story, constructing it carefully, to set the stage for the rest of the letter, in which he will challenge false teachers who argued that new Christians had to submit to Jewish law. Paul had been a pharisee, self-described as “extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors” (Galatians 1:14). He knew the law. He lived by it and for it. \n\nThen Paul explains his own total transformation as “when God, who from my mother’s womb set me apart and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me” (vv.15–16). Paul became an apostle of Jesus; he knew his Savior, and lived by Him and for Him. God called Paul to Himself, and through the work of Christ and the indwelling of the Spirit, Paul was totally transformed. The same transformation is offered to us by God’s grace. \n\nI love how God calls them to Himself in Joel 2 (harkening back to Exodus 34) where God reveals His character to Moses: \n\nEven now—\nthis is the LORD’s declaration—\nturn to me with all your heart,\nwith fasting, weeping, and mourning.\nTear your hearts,\nnot just your clothes,\nand return to the LORD your God.\nFor he is gracious and compassionate,\nslow to anger, abounding in faithful love,\nand he relents from sending disaster (vv.12–13).\n\nThis is the invitation before me this morning: to turn to God, to anchor myself in prayer, Scripture, and the Spirit. Because I can trust God and His character, I can trust His process of transformation—His grace, compassion, patience, and steadfast love.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nWe named our cat “Maple” after a Robert Frost poem of the same name, about a girl named Maple who lives her whole life beholden to a name that almost everyone gets wrong. Everyone thinks her name is “Mabel,” because that’s a real name, and it is much more comfortable to call someone a real, normal name than a strange name. \n\nHer teacher’s certainty it must be MabelMade Maple first take notice of her name.She asked her father and he told her, “Maple—Maple is right.”“But teacher told the schoolThere’s no such name.”\n\nA name with no eponymous history made a girl feel strange and unseen, as if because her name wasn’t real or familiar, she wasn’t either, and thus goes the poem and her life story. \n\nWhen Paul writes the letter to the Galatians, he calls out the false teachers who cried, “you can’t be Christian without being Jewish,” and asked Gentile (non-Jewish) Christians to follow Jewish laws, particularly those regarding circumcision and food. Their ideas were rooted in ethnic and cultural expectations that Paul was unafraid to challenge. \n\nSimilar to the teacher in “Maple” who wanted her name to be “Mabel,” the Judaizers assumed that Christians should look and eat like Jews (see Acts 15:5), because that made sense to them. The message of “be like us to be a Christian” is deeply wounding, rooted in racial superiority and cultural authority. It is not unfamiliar to any era in Church history, from the first to the present.\n\nThe radical transformation of faith in Christ, Paul claims, equalizes everyone. Sin flattens us, all unworthy. But Christ redeems us, and presents us beautifully clean, whole, and unified before God. Christianity is open and welcoming to all, and in it “there is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male and female; since you are all one in Christ Jesus,” Paul writes in the next chapter (Galatians 3:28).\n\nPaul talks often of the body of Christ (Romans 12:3–8), and the rubber of ethnic differences meets the road of his ministry in Galatians. And in chapter 2, he specifically explains that the apostles to the Jews (James, Peter, and John) agreed with him that there was no need for Titus or other Gentile Christians to submit to Jewish ritual law. \n\nIt feels so personal to wade into this water: the rolling waves of our differences as humans. I feel Galatians reading me as much as I am reading it. What expectations do I have for other believers, and for myself? What do I think Christians should look like, act like? How should they think and feel? What do I add to the truth, or what do I believe that others have added? \n\nIn his commentary on Galatians, Martin Luther wrote, “The world bears the Gospel a grudge because the Gospel condemns the religious wisdom of the world.” The gospel calls us into deep and equal fellowship with all other believers. Anything less is hypocrisy. \n\nOver and over, Jesus confronted the religious wisdom of the world. Paul shows us how true discipleship and evangelism should be shaped by Christ, not the world. It is as simple, and as profoundly complicated, as “God does not show favoritism” (Galatians 2:6). We can substitute categories from centuries of Church history into the slots of “Jew” and “Gentile,” but the truth does not change. The gospel is just as true for you as it is for me or anyone else. Our salvation is based only on the finished work of Christ—nothing we do or don’t do can change it. We are secure in our Savior. Thanks be to God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI once took a conflict assessment (like a personality test, but for workplace conflict styles) that revealed to me that I have a “collaborative” conflict style. This means when conflict arises, I try to identify solutions that work for everyone. This is often a recipe for disaster. \n\nI like to present a lot of options and then back slowly out of the room (metaphorically) and not make any decision that will make other people upset. I am a problem solver, but in the “here are a bunch of ways to solve it, you decide!” kind of way. \n\nPaul is not like that, and especially not in his conflict with Peter. \n\nThe latter half of Galatians 2 is one of the strongest rebukes of an apostle in the Bible. Paul calls Peter a hypocrite who deviated from the true gospel. Peter had been eating non-Jewish-law-approved meals with Gentile Christians. But when a group of radical Jewish leaders called the circumcision party disapproved, Peter stopped eating with Gentiles. The Judaizers believed that to be a true Christian, a Gentile had to become Jewish first and follow Jewish law. \n\nIn his book, Galatians for You, Tim Keller writes, “Paul did not simply say: You’re breaking the rules (even though Peter was), but: You’ve forgotten the gospel: your own gracious welcome in Christ. Paul did not focus so much on the sinful behavior as on the sinful attitude of self-righteousness that lay beneath it.”\n\nLiving out the gospel often rubs against cultural best practices, be they ancient or modern. More often than I wish, I capitulate like Peter. I wonder, how can I live out my faith but in a way that doesn’t make other people angry or uncomfortable? I live in the irreconcilable tension of seeking the approval of both God and man (directly antithetical to what we read a few days ago in Galatians 1:10). \n\nAfter rebuking Peter, Paul goes on to make one of the most impassioned, beautiful expositions of the true gospel. He says, “a person is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ… I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing” (vv.16,21). \n\nPaul spends the rest of Galatians building on this truth: the traditional Jewish law does not save or purify people, only faith in Christ who died and rose again. The approval of other people doesn’t save you either, and you only need acceptance by God the Father, gained by the righteousness of Christ given to us when we believe. All we need is in Christ. All we have is Christ. Christ did not die for nothing; He died for you and me.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nAs an early twenty-something, I loved crafting handwritten letters. Throw in some turquoise calligraphy ink and a wax seal, and you had an elegant artifact from the past. Letters have a level of intimacy and importance that texts simply can’t convey, and each one is a labor of love. \n\nDuring this letter-writing phase, I also had what you might call a spiritual crush on the Apostle Paul. (C. S. Lewis was a close second, but, you know, he can’t compete with an actual apostle.) Paul’s legendary passion for truth was compelling, and as a twenty-something weaving together a worldview, his letters served as models for discipleship in my life. One evening at Starbucks, I handed out “epistles” to my friends—handwritten notes of encouragement that challenged them to persevere with hope. \n\nThe book of Galatians is considered one of Paul’s most intense epistles. Although his language was strong and corrective, it was also a labor of love. His intent wasn’t to admonish the Galatians just to cool his head; it was to expose a false gospel that had begun seeping into the community. This false gospel was reverting back to justification through law. When Paul calls these people “foolish” and like those with “a spell” cast over them (Gl 3:1), it’s because their version of the gospel had them in bondage. With a sharp prod, he pushed back against their habits. “Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law,” asked Paul, “or by believing what you heard?” (Gl 3:2). \n\nThough they had first believed the Spirit through hearing, they soon sought salvation through human performance again. I admit, I understand the temptation. Following a law is so much easier because it’s a visible, measurable act. But the realm of belief? Well, that can feel far more terrifying—a mere “whistling in the dark,” as Frederick Buechner puts it. But Abraham’s promise of faith is more than just a haunted optimism. It’s the very foundation of his covenant with God (Gl 3:7–9).\n\nAs an apostle of Christ, Paul’s role spurred him to awaken people out of disobedience by calling out ungodly behavior. Yet, as an apostle of Christ, he wasn’t calling them out from a place of anger or indifference. He was moved with compassion over how their efforts were sabotaging their own freedom. \n\nBecause it was for our freedom that Christ came.\n\nIt’s hard to trust God if we distrust his method of salvation. The promise of faith is a gift, but goodness gracious is it hard to accept sometimes. I’m thankful for figures like Paul or Martin Luther or, most importantly, the Spirit on this faith journey. When we surrender our own strength or desires to control the outcome and give ourselves over to the work of the Spirit, true freedom awaits. Let’s keep walking that long obedience in the same direction, together. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nLight wanes\n\nOn Wednesday evening of this last Holy Week, I attended the Tenebrae service through a local Anglican church. Held at the Belcourt Theater, this service draws its name from the latin word for “darkness” and is intended to capture the depth of sin and brokenness—without resolution. \n\nOn the stage, there was a tier with twelve candles. Traditionally, one candle at a time is snuffed out until the room is completely dark, encouraging people to leave the room in silence. The purpose is to sit with the sorrow of Christ’s death longer than we feel comfortable with so that the triumph of Resurrection Sunday is all the more joyous. \n\nI was nervous to attend. Friends described it as being a pretty visceral experience, and since I already have a personality that’s sharply attuned to darkness and suffering, I wasn’t sure it was the best idea. But the event was meant to commemorate the fact that Christ had been crucified to break the curse of sin and death. The very least I could do was sit in an old theater seat.\n\nDarkness grows\n\nIn the dark rows, candlelight flickering, we watched the opening piece: the music video to Johnny Cash’s song, “Hurt.” I couldn’t help but see the connection between that haunting lyric and Christ’s agony in the garden of Gethsemane:\n\n“What have I become, my sweetest friend? Everyone I know goes away in the end”\n\nIn Galatians, Paul says that “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us” (3:13). Although God set the law in motion, it could never save us. It always pointed to the cross. Because the law leads to death, only death could satisfy sin and lead to eternal life. \n\nThe heaviness of what I felt during this Tenebrae service was just a sliver of what Christ felt on the cross. He carried the weight of the whole world’s suffering on his shoulders. Can you imagine? Yet, somehow, “for the joy that lay before Him, He endured the cross” (Heb 12:2). \n\nDarkness overcomes\n\nOver the course of the evening, I could feel my breaths grow shallow and staccato-like. My friends were right. It was hard to sit through. More than once, I closed my eyes and breathed deeply, hoping to ground my body, while at the same time hold close the story of my Lord’s suffering. Thinking about Christ being made a curse for our sake makes me shudder because there was such a cost to fulfill the demands of the law—a cost so great that the earth grew dark from the sixth to the ninth hour (Mt 27:45). \n\nLight reemerges\n\nBut the shocking beauty of the gospel is that this “great reversal” transforms Christ’s persecution into our blessing. The law is fulfilled and replaced with a promise, and we never need to fear the darkness again. The curse has been lifted. It is finished. \n\nLight endures\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nWhile reading the Bible, I’m often struck by what it must have been like living under the law—especially after Christ’s ministry on earth. For so long, the world followed an established, works-based system. How could people not be skeptical or disoriented by this new way of thinking? Even if it led to freedom, human nature often returns to what’s familiar if the cost outweighs our own good.\n\nThe gospel made it so that salvation was no longer dependent on perfect execution of the law. With Christ, it was all about receiving, not doing. Belief, not effort. Grace. \n\nTalk about feeling your way around in the dark! When you’re used to managing your own righteousness, trading in the safe familiarity of rules for the wild realm of belief sounds foolish at first. I totally understand why they were wary of this “good news.” But the law was never the whole story. The law’s purpose was only ever to serve as a placeholder “until the coming faith was revealed” (Gl 3:23). \n\nIn Galatians, Paul describes the law as being our guardian until Christ came. Maybe I just haven’t read that passage in the Christian Standard Bible translation before, but until now I’ve never, ever thought about the law in this way. Truly, how beautiful this is! In our cultural moment, I think it’s easy to condemn ancient God followers (especially the Pharisees) as being resistant to relinquishing their system. But the reason they held the law so close to their hearts was because, at the time, that was the direct path to righteousness. As it turns out, it wasn’t the ultimate path to life, but it had its own purpose to accomplish. \n\nI don’t know about you, but I’ve never loved the darkness. Whether it was navigating a dark night of the soul or waking up in the middle of the night to eerie tree silhouettes dancing on the walls, I usually regard darkness as the enemy. However, I recently encountered a new idea: darkness also nourishes, holds, and prepares. I just love this. You can see it in the creation story. Darkness always comes before light, but that doesn’t mean that light renders it irrelevant. It just fills and overwhelms it by its very nature.\n\nI think the law was God’s severe mercy. We couldn’t justify ourselves, and neither could religion, but God didn’t leave us to our own ends. He provided this strange guardian—holding, preparing us until Christ’s death and resurrection fulfilled the law and the prophets. \n\nNow, we have the sweet, sweet privilege of releasing our anxious work and resting in the knowledge that “through faith you are all sons of God in Christ Jesus” (Gl 3:26).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nOne of my closest friends, Rory, has a fierce loyalty to both Jesus and quality coffee beans. Lately, while coffeeshop crawling around town, we seem to keep coming back to the same topics: G. K. Chesterton, the Enneagram, men, and what she likes to call “ecumenical dialogue.” \n\nAlthough we don’t share a love for coffee, we do share a passion for the Church in all its broken, messy complexity. Having had exposure to a wide range of church traditions, these conversations always remind us that we long for deeper unity—remembering that God doesn’t align more with one end of the faith spectrum than the other: He is the spectrum. \n\nWhen Paul calls for unity in his Galatians epistle, he declares, “There is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male and female since you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Gl 4:28). Human nature just wants to divide. It doesn’t seem to matter if it’s denominational or sociopolitical or any other categorization: it wants to raise and lower inherent value to seek and further its own good. But the gospel is a hospitable, open table where everyone is honored. \n\nDuring Paul’s missionary journeys, he needed to clarify the heartbeat of the gospel to an ancient world that devalued Jews, slaves, and females. Religion was just one more system that marginalized them. The temptation to reserve the gospel for those who didn’t seem to need it as much began to quelch what should have been “good news.” Good news for all—not just those who already had all the freedom they needed. \n\nPaul urges us to remember that the kingdom of God isn’t discriminatory. It’s heaven extending its hand and inviting us to a feast as brothers and sisters. We are, communally, made in the complex image of God. No individual, no matter how impoverished in mind, body, or resources is exempt from His lavish hospitality. Although we’re born into this world enslaved, He adopts us and makes us not “a slave, but a son” and an “heir” (Gl 4:7). We are now all heirs to this grace.\n\nNo community is perfect, but my home church back in California does a beautiful job at pursuing unity. It’s quirky and hard to pin down theologically. The air circulation isn’t great, and the worship flows in and out of syncopation. But, boy, does that church know how to love. On any given Sunday, on your way to the Eucharist table, you may meet those who are wealthy or who ride a bicycle to work. Who have a PhD in early church history or who have never taken a college class. This church doesn’t quite fit or belong to any one denominational stream. And maybe the reason why I gravitate to churches like this is because I, too, never quite feel like I fit or belong. It’s churches like these that remind me why the gospel is good news. \n\nMay we always have a spirit of hospitality toward our brothers and sisters. After all, we’re all just looking for a family in which to belong, and Jesus has made us this hopeful promise: “I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you” (Jn 14:18).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nLast year, I told a good friend that my life felt characterized by loss. We were sitting in a two-story coffee shop, iced chai in hand, and I felt guilty as soon as I said it. After all, this wasn’t entirely true. Loss didn’t always steal my joy in those times of tasting God’s goodness and His many good gifts, but it always overshadowed it once my attention drifted to what had been taken away. My friend then did what he does best: challenge that belief. This didn’t need to be the story, or lens, through which I interpreted my life. We could learn to look for what was there, rather than what was missing. \n\nThe truth was I was enslaved to this false narrative, just like the Galatians were enslaved to former ways of living. It’s easy to read the New Testament and wonder why it was so hard for people to stay faithful to God after an encounter. These people had known God and been known by Him, yet they turned away. Why? How do people who were living so close to the time of Christ—and the formation of the early church—turn away from it? This was the question also burning inside of the apostle Paul. “But now,” he said, “since you know God, or rather have become known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elements? Do you want to be enslaved to them all over again?” (Gl 4:9). \n\nPaul is implying that real relationship should inspire loyalty and freedom. Instead, the Galatians had become enslaved to “weak and worthless elements” by reverting back to worshipping false gods. You see, human nature is human nature. Even after encountering God today, like the Galatians encountered Him back then, we still allow ourselves to be enslaved by untrue stories or objects of false hope. \n\n“Where, then, is your blessing?” Paul asks (Gl 4:15). We can’t receive the blessing of being sons and daughters if we are enslaved to the law, or false gods, or any other object outside of Christ. That is, in fact, the very curse of sin that Christ came to break. \n\nPaul so deeply desired that these people find freedom and a genuine commitment to God that He said He was “suffering labor pains” until Christ was formed in them (4:19). This type of personal interest only comes from someone who encounters Jesus, finds transformation, and seeks the eternal well-being of others. \n\nStaying close to Jesus is the only way to release the things we’re enslaved to. Whether it’s the narratives in our heads, or other tangible idols, we will never be able to fight hard enough against the inclinations of our own flesh. Victory comes through Christ alone. Victory and blessing. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI think a lot about how the circumstances of our birth affect our futures. I bet Isaac and Ishmael did too. Their mothers, Sarah and Hagar, represent the old and new covenants. Sarah was Abraham’s wife, and when she didn’t conceive, she impatiently sent her servant to conceive in her place. Her servant Hagar bore Ishmael. Sarah later bore Isaac. God established the old covenant to teach us our need for a Savior. When Christ came, He fulfilled the law and the covenant. And he ushered in the new covenant of grace.\n\nThis was an abstract and new concept for the Galatians, and the Judaizers were all over them—trying to draw them back into confusion and slavery to the law. Paul is trying to help us understand by putting it in terms we are familiar with: human efforts to solve divine problems. It’s in our nature to try to settle things on our own terms. And the ancient Mediterraneans of Galatia couldn’t fulfill the law any more than we can. Paul demonstrated that the Judaizers, in deceptively drawing the Galatians to rely upon the law of Moses for their justification, are not acting in accord with the promise given to Abraham, but are turning from that promise. \n\nSalvation does not come to us by the works of the law, even the law of Moses, which was literally given by God at Sinai. The pursuit of salvation by works of the law is not sufficient. The end result, as it was for Ishmael and Hagar, is to be driven out. Why? Because the only means of attaining the inheritance promised to Abraham, of true fellowship with God, is by faith. To rely on deceit, or only on the law, is to reject true salvation and freedom, which comes only by faith in Christ. \n\nNeither Isaac nor Ishmael could control the circumstances of their birth. Paul is reminding us that our identity is not established by what we have done or will do. It is not something we can earn. Rather, our identity is fixed with Christ. This should have a radical impact on how we live and think. We are simultaneously set free from the exhaustion and impossibility of earning God’s favor, and filled with gratitude for the inheritance we have so freely received. This gratitude, not the threat of the law, is the motive for Christian living.\n\nSarah represents the covenant of faith and grace, but Hagar represents the covenant of failed human effort. Ishmael was Abrahams and Sarah’s plan, but Isaac was God’s plan. The law is not a means to leverage salvation. Isaac received the inheritance of the promise. “Now you too, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.” (Galatians 4:28)\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nGive us an inch, and we’ll take a mile. Christians can fall prey to the same temptations as everyone else. It can be hard to know where to draw the line in our Christian freedom. We’re “called to be free,” but how free? (Galatians 5:13). What movies should we really allow ourselves to watch? How much time can we spend on our phones every day? How often do we actually need to be in church on Sunday morning? We are not bound by the ten thousand commandments, and we instead enjoy the freedom and grace of two: \n\n“‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’  This is the greatest and most important command. The second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’  All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commands” (Matthew 22:37–40). \n\nReally, in just these two commands, all are fulfilled. In this we see what Paul means when he calls the Galatians to “faith working through love” (Galatians 5:6). With this in mind, suddenly, it seems we actually have a lot of freedom.\n\nThe law of the Spirit is not rooted in a slavish obedience to the law of Moses, but in a loving obedience to the God of grace. The law itself was never designed to save us, as the Judaizers were teaching; it only signifies our guilt and condemns us, because we are unable to keep it (Matthew 5:17–20). But the gospel of grace delivers us from bondage to the law and its condemnation. We are indeed free! For in Christ, there is now no condemnation (Romans 8:1).\n\nThe Ten Commandments allow for freedom in Christ, but that freedom is not for us to see how much we can get away with; rather, it is freedom to bear the fruit of love for one another, as brothers and sisters. It is not to be used as an opportunity to return to the flesh. So how do we use our freedom rightly?\n\nThe Holy Spirit must quicken us inwardly. Our hearts must be circumcised, not our bodies. “Circumcision benefits you if you observe the law, but if you are a lawbreaker, your circumcision has become uncircumcision” (Romans 2:25). Outward acts of faith are not a measure of our identity in Christ. It is the inward washing of the Spirit alone that sets us free.\n\nIn fact, a faith that looks amazing from the outside can be deceptive. Man judges by the outside, but God judges the heart (1 Samuel 16:7). Our hunger for outward approval and reputation often ensnares us, and distracts us from our need for the inward work of the Spirit. The end result is a shallow and fruitless faith, which actually makes us “alienated from Christ” (Galatians 5:4). Furthermore, the pride of self-reliance also produced discord in the church at Galatia, prompting Paul’s warning: “If you bite and devour one another, watch out, or you will be consumed by one another” (v.15).\n\nTrue freedom is found in the love and Lordship of Christ, which “compels us” to love others as He has loved us (2 Corinthians 5:14–15). In Christ Jesus, we are free from bondage to the law, and free to serve Christ instead. He has called us to walk in the liberty of love. May we use our freedom to show our gratitude to Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI’m a list maker. I need them to clarify my thoughts, and my brain works best when I put pen to paper. There are the staples—Christmas lists, to-do lists, and grocery lists—but I also keep lists of the national parks we’ve visited (Glacier really is the crown of the continent), my favorite things about my good dog (that nuzzly pink nose), and foods I never, ever want to eat again. (I’m looking at you, Hot Pockets.)\n\nLists are a helpful way to show us all the angles of an idea. One word says a lot, but seven pointing to the same big idea really leave no room for confusion. In this passage, Paul gives us two lists: a list of death and a list of life—the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:19–23). And boy, do I love the look of that “fruit of the spirit” list. I want that list to be the accounting of my days—not the nonsense in other list.\n\nBut life is busy and complicated, and we often find ourselves shifting back and forth between these two lists. How do we find victory over sin that ultimately only leads to death? Paul very succinctly declares that the only means by which we may find victory over sin is to “walk by the Spirit and [we] will certainly not carry out the desire of the flesh” (v.16). Notice Paul doesn’t say we might not succumb to our flesh; he says we will certainly not—what a declaration!\n\nOur flesh wars with the Spirit (James 1:14–15), but Paul encourages us in this manner: “If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:25). This is a powerful image! We’re not expected to walk out our faith journey alone; instead, we must learn to yield to the Holy Spirit. In daily life, our heart’s proclivities lead us away from the Word and drown out the voice of the Spirit; it’s easier to listen to our senses, our circumstances, and our vain desires. Our inattention to the Spirit causes us to fall out of step with Him. Theologian John Owen put it this way: “Be killing sin, or it will be killing you.” \n\nDaily, hourly, we are to fix our attention on the Word, hide it in our hearts, and yield our desires to Christ— not by our own strength, but by yielding to the Spirit within us. We must bring our bone-dry souls to the Fountain of Life. As God promised to Ezekiel: “You will know that I am the LORD, my people, when I open your graves and bring you up from them. I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live” (Ezekiel 37:13–14).\n\nHere’s the good news: this is all God’s work; a life in step with the Spirit grows out of the Spirit of adoption that we have already received by grace. God calls us to live in the Spirit that He has already given, “for [we] are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from [ourselves]; it is God’s gift” (Ephesians 2:8). Though the world, the flesh, and the devil continually vie for our attention, God has extended to our very lips “the spring of the water of life” (Revelation 21:6). Drink freely. Drink deeply. Drink continually. Walk in step with His Spirit.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nSeptember is a busy month for all of us. In my neck of the woods we’re packing, renovating, homeschooling, working—and I’m still nursing a baby. You may also be experiencing a season like this right now. When I’m busy, it’s harder for me to deal tenderly with everyone else’s particular struggles. It feels like quite enough to manage my own burdens without even entering into the burdens of someone else.\n\nBut God has entrusted us with precious souls. Our friends, our parents, our children, our spouses—anyone the Lord brings before us—we are called to deal tenderly with each other. There is a huge cultural impulse toward “self-care,” but this is not what we as Christians are called to focus on. We are called to bear one another’s burdens, to walk alongside each other on this faith journey. We are called to focus on the Lord and care for others. Even when we’re busy. Even when the burdens of others seem inconvenient. Even when we really, really just want to push them away.\n\nFortunately, Paul delivers some practical direction for us. He shows what walking by the Spirit looks like in some very common and practical circumstances. His first instruction: deal tenderly with those overtaken in wrongdoing (v.1). To be overtaken in wrongdoing is to be caught by temptation and then falter. This is very different from someone who has chosen to deliberately walk in sin, willfully pursuing it. In order to love others well, we need to remember our own sinfulness and God’s grace to us. Yes, sin must be treated as sin, but always in the spirit of love, and in light of God’s forgiveness and constant love for us.\n\nAnd then we must make the way home easy, restoring them with a gentle spirit, responding in love rather than in wrath and fury. Remember the parable of the Prodigal Son? (Luke 15:11–32). We ought to make the way home easy, welcoming them, celebrating and rejoicing because what once “was lost [has been] found” (v.32).\n\nIt’s far too easy to deal with other people’s sins, well… sinfully. Ironic, huh? But knowing full well the battle between flesh and Spirit that actively wars within each one of us (Galatians 5:17), we ought to show mercy and tenderness toward those who stumble, because we, too, live only by the tender mercy of God. Apart from His grace, none of us could stand before Him.\n\nPaul’s second instruction is to carry one another’s burdens, both the circumstantial burdens of this life, like finances, food, and shelter, and also the burdens of sin and temptation. We are to be a strengthening influence for our fellow sojourners in the faith—succor in time of need, encouragement in time of weakness, support in times of faltering. “In this way,” Paul declares, “[we] will fulfill the law of Christ” (v.2). \n\nWow. What a statement. We like to make sure our neighbors are dotting their I’s and crossing their T’s, instead of seeking ways to love and serve them as Christ has loved and served us—as a humble servant, laying down His life in love for us. May we learn to follow the pattern of Christ, not in duty, but in love. In this way, we will not tire of doing good, but will reap the fruit of faithful love in the communion of the saints (Hosea 10:12).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nAt summer camp, I won an award for having curly hair. The curliest, naturally curly hair. I felt pretty proud of myself that night. The next morning at breakfast I assumed everyone was whispering, “Is that the curly hair queen?” Yes, yes, it is I!\n\nSigh.\n\nAnd goodness, isn’t this about the level of all the things we boast about? Things we truly have no control over? We can certainly work hard and make good choices. But our eye color and our physical achievements, our successes and our relationships—aren’t all these things really just gifts from God? \n\nInstead of boasting in what amounts to little more than circumstances from our birth, we are called to boast in the Lord (Galatians 6:14). And “the one who boasts should boast in this: that he understands and knows me—that I am the LORD, showing faithful love, justice, and righteousness on the earth, for I delight in these things. This is the LORD’s declaration” (Jeremiah 9:24).\n\nThe Hebrew word for God’s “enduring, covenantal love” is hesed. In his book Inexpressible, Michael Card defines hesed beautifully as, “When the person from whom I have a right to expect nothing gives me everything.” Our boasting then, is to be in the undeserved and overwhelming love of Christ, who—while we were His enemies, helpless in our sin—gave His life for us, so that we could be children of God (Romans 5:6–11).\n\nPaul’s benediction appeals to this same hesed, as he speaks to the Galatian church that had foolishly followed after the false teachings of the Judaizers, and wandered from the life of the Spirit. As he had earlier called on them to deal gently with those who are overtaken by sin, so also Paul deals gently with the Galatians. Why? Because Christ has dealt gently with Paul. And so Paul can boast in one thing only: the hesed of God, seen most clearly in the cross of Christ. He exhorts the Galatians to do the same.\n\nThe apostle then blesses the Galatians with a benediction that can only result from the steadfast love of God. Because of God’s undeserved and faithful love, we have fellowship with one another. We have restoration when we are overtaken in sin, and reconciliation with those we have offended, including Christ our Lord. Because of His love for us, we are part of the family of God, brothers and sisters, and co-heirs with Christ to the inheritance of God’s eternal kingdom.\n\nPaul goes on to bless the Galatians with the grace of Christ, for it is His grace alone which saves, restores, sustains, secures, and transforms us into His own likeness. This He does by the work of His Spirit in our spirits, in our hearts, and in our minds. In Him, we are a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nThe final note of Paul’s epistle to the Galatians is a resounding praise of Christ, in whom alone we boast. Next time you get ready to toot your own horn over your own achievements, remember that there’s no need to rejoice over ourselves, because our Creator already rejoices over us with singing (Zephaniah 3:17). Let His rejoicing over us be enough, and may we instead glory in Christ alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nI have a dear friend who wants to be a foster mom so badly, she can hardly speak of it without tears pooling in her pretty eyes. She longs to be a safe place for children without a home, to give graciously to those whose lives are marked by need, to be a friend to the teenager who is convinced she’ll always be alone.\n\nThinking about this, of course, makes me cry. Because I know my friend, I know the weight of these gifts she’s giving. And I know they aren’t simply gifts to one person or a few, but they are gifts to us all. So, all I can say is YES. Thank you for giving what you are not obligated to give to those who cannot repay you for your gifts. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nThis kind of overwhelming gratitude is Paul’s tone as he begins his letter to the Ephesians. Well, this times infinity. Paul isn’t giving thanks for a gift given only to himself, or only to a few. He is praising the Lord for the gifts given to all believers— indeed, to ANYONE who would believe in Jesus as Messiah.\n\nPraise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heaven. —Ephesians 1:3 HCSB\n\nWhat are these blessings that have Paul borderline giddy, with his praise hands held high? In verses 3-14— which were a actually one, long sentence in the Greek— Paul declares three gifts, or blessings, that are irrevocably theirs (and ours!) in Christ. Let’s see if we can identify them together.\n\nBlessing #1: God the Father elects. (Ephesians 1:3-6)\n\nI know, words like “chosen” and “elect” and “predestine” make me squirmy, too. But they’re there, in black and white (and not just there, but throughout Scripture. Use John 6:44, Romans 8:29, Ephesians 1:5 as starting points for further reading). But before we get put our defenses up, consider this with me: What if we focused less on the selectivity we perceive in these words and more on the surety they present?\n\nWe know God saves us according to His love and mercy, not in response to any works of our own. (This is what Paul spent an entire letter scream-talking to the Galatians about in our last study! See Galatians 3:11.) Because our salvation is by Him alone, it must be intended and carried out by Him alone. He is the only one able to do it! Now, couple that with this glorious passage in John 1:12: “But to all who did receive Him, He gave them the right to be children of God.” God gives guilty sinners undeserved gifts and makes them our right.\n\nElection is not a hoop to jump through. Election means there is no hoop! God chose us. All the hoops are null because Christ jumped through them all for all.\n\nBlessing #2: the Son redeems. (Ephesians 1:7-12)\n\nThe first blessing is eternal—God chose us before He poured the world’s foundation, and we reap the benefit yesterday, today, tomorrow, forever. Likewise, our redemption in Christ is a present and eternal promise. We are forgiven now, and we will be forgiven still. The redemption gained by Christ’s blood will never expire.\n\nNot only that, but Christ’s sacrifice unifies all believers. Paul’s letter was written to the earliest Christians, who knew people as belonging to one of two categories—Jews and Gentiles. That God’s plan of redemption included any and all who would believe, regardless of their ethnicity, was radically good news.\n\nBlessing #3: the Spirit seals. (Ephesians 1:13-14)\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the fulfillment of Christ’s promise to send a Counselor (John 14:26). But the Spirit is also Himself a promise, a down payment of our full redemption and future glory. God is the only One who can give eternally, not bound by time and space or any other limitation. His promises are as good as fulfilled the moment He makes them! God gives us the Holy Spirit to be with us now as we await Glory, but also as our Glory guarantee (Romans 8:30).\n\nWhew. That’s a lot of blessing, you guys.\n\nIt’s no wonder Paul rattled all this off in one, long, Greek sentence—this is incredible and incredibly life-changing good news! Salvation is a gift sovereignly and freely given by God, redemption is fully accomplished by the Son, and our future glory is safely sealed by the Spirit. \n\nFriends, this message was not just for the churches in and around Ephesus. This message is for you and me. We have been given a wealth of gifts we can never earn, a heap of blessings we can never repay, only because our good God desires to give them.\n\nYES. Thank you, Lord, for giving what You are not obligated to give to we who are only made worthy by the sacrifice of your Son. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Annie Downs\n\nIt’s not unusual for me to be in a room full of people who are smarter than I am. It’s partly because that’s a goal of mine: to surround myself with people who are significantly better at life than me. But it’s also because I’m just not Harvard material. I may have an above average funny bone, but my brain is pretty average.\n\nA few years ago, I was selected to be in a month-long class full of people who are massively impacting the world and doing it with their impressive brains and contributions to society, through technology and non-profit work. I kind of snuck in—it was the favor of God for sure. For an entire month, I sat around a table with ten people of different religious and regional backgrounds from me, and certainly a much higher pedigree. My average brain and I were one of a kind.\n\nEarly on in that first week, I realized I didn’t have what it took to hang with that crowd; and the worst part was, they knew it, too. It wasn’t long before I was being overlooked in conversations and ignored by my peers when group work was being done. They had weighed my brain and found it wanting.\n\nEach day, I took the train from one side of town to the other in order to attend this symposium, and the commute gave me time to read my Bible and journal a bit. I was desperate for God’s help every day, nervous to go in and sit with that group of rockstars, wishing to avoid the embarrassment of not being smart enough for them.\n\nBut God steered me toward Scripture about what our minds can really do—what MY mind can do. We can pray for our brains to be enlightened because we’ve been given the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16). Our actual thinking and ideas are sharpened by the indwelling of our all-knowing and all-powerful God! Even better, we can present those ideas with full integrity and honesty, because we have the mind of our perfect Savior.\n\nI began to pray earnestly that God would increase what my brain could do—not because I wanted to be the brainiest person in the group for that month, but because I realized I was the only representative of Christ in that room. How my brain showed up reflected Him. If Jesus really fills all things in all ways like Ephesians 1:23 says, couldn’t He do that with my mind? I wanted a transformation, a new wineskin (Matthew 9:17), a better mind. I wanted the mind of Christ.\n\nAnd as I prayed each morning, it happened. I don’t consider it an exaggeration to tell you it felt like a miracle to me. My capacity to remember increased, ideas came to me more quickly, and it felt like my brain muscle was getting stronger. As the month rolled on, my relationships around that table changed as they started hearing me, trusting me, and allowing me to equally contribute to the conversations. \n\nMaybe I’d become way smarter. But maybe, above all else, my confidence was through the roof. I HAD THE MIND OF CHRIST. I could share any idea, and whether it was loved or not, I believed it was a good one. Jesus had changed me; the power of prayer had worked for my good and for His glory.\n\nYears later, I am changed by that month, but not just by what happened in the classroom. I am far more changed by my time on the train and what God taught me there. The power of Jesus changes our lives, but it changes our minds, too. \n\nThese days, I run my own business. I write books for a living. I have to have a mind that is focused and increasing in knowledge constantly. I read books, I listen to podcasts and lectures. But the honest truth about any smarts I have is because of exactly what Ephesians says: I pray for spiritual insight. I pray for wisdom beyond my years and in spite of my tendency towards foolishness. I ask Jesus to do in my mind the miracles only He can do—fill me with the immeasurable greatness of His power. Everything good in me is for the glory of Christ (Philemon 1:6).\n\nOur strength is limited, but His strength is vast. Our hope wanes, but His hope is eternal. His Word says His riches and power are now ours (Ephesians 1:18-19). Let’s believe Him.\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sarah Matheny\n\nThe best day in all of social media, I would argue, is Thursday. On Thursdays we are treated to a little something the kids are calling “Throwback Thursday,” or #tbt. I don’t pretend to be able to keep up with social media trends, so I hope you’ll forgive me if I’m #doingitwrong.\n\nRegardless, Throwback Thursday is, in a word, awesome. After all, everyone loves a good makeover. Whether it’s simply to ridicule the past or embrace the present, I think we can all agree that witnessing a transformation is tremendously satisfying. That is, unless you are the casualty of someone else’s #tbt, and are left having to untag a very public photo of yourself sporting a spiral perm, Aqua-Net-frozen bangs, acid-washed jeans, bright yellow slouchy socks, and knock-off Keds. (That description alone confirms that I am indeed too old to be talking about any kind of current trend whatsoever.)\n\nWhen reading Paul’s words in the opening of Ephesians 2, we’d be remiss to equate his description of transformation with some sort of cute, little makeover. Not only would it minimize the transforming power of the love of Christ, which we’ll get to shortly, but it would also gloss over the depravity of sin.  \n\nPaul writes that when “we followed the ways of this world” we were dead (Ephesians 2:1-2).  He’s obviously not speaking of adhering to sad fashion trends here, or any other poor choices we’ve made, really. He’s talking about who we are in ourselves, about the nature of our flesh, and about the Enemy at work in our disobedience of God. He’s talking about death.\n\nWhen I think of the horror of sin in light of who Christ is and has created us to be, I remember those PSA-style posters they showed us in high school, the ones depicting the decline of a methamphetamine user. Each picture shows the individual falling further into their addiction, gratifying their flesh despite the severe cost to their wellbeing. The physical deterioration is alarming. Even more horrifying, though, is that you can almost see the life leaving their eyes. How can death be what God intended for His workmanship? It isn’t!\n\nSisters, this is what it looks like for any of us— or our neighbors, friends, and family— to live a life apart from Christ. Paul adds that we, left to our nature, are deserving of this dark fate and, even worse, the wrath of our our Creator (Ephesians 2:3). I’m so grateful there is a “but” in these verses!\n\nBut God.\n\nBut God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love that He had for us, made us alive with the Messiah even though we were dead in trespasses. You are saved by grace! –Ephesians 2:4-5 HCSB\n\nGod is the Author of our lives and of the change in our lives—not because we deserve it, but only because of His goodness, His mercy, and His love. There is no behind-the-scenes footage to be shown of the good works that earned us such a gift. No, this soul-deep change is made in spite of our behind-the-scenes footage! We are saved by grace. \n\nWe can marvel at the transforming power of His love. It’s a love that raises us up with Him on the resurrection side of the grave and makes us truly alive. It’s a love that makes us new. This is what we were made for! Not the death, depravity, and suffering we experience while trying to live life apart from Him.\n\nWe are His masterpiece. “He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things He planned for us long ago” (Ephesians 2:10, NLT). Obedience, service, Kingdom-building—these are no longer duties and burdens to be carried but blessings to be fulfilled. They are byproducts of being made new in Christ!\n\nThough God gently reminds us— by His Word and in His love— of who we once were, He will never leave us or abandon us. He will never throw us back, not even on a Thursday.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nIt’s so tough that we have to live with people.\n\nI mean, we would be so lonely without them, but it’s hard to get along, you know? My family is seven people. Seven mouths to feed, fourteen feet to shoe, one-hundred-forty fingernails and toenails to trim, and a million ideas about the purpose of a Saturday. It’s complicated. Even if you don’t have that many folks under your roof, it’s hard to keep the peace anytime we’re forced to rub shoulders with other imperfect humans.\n\nEven when times are so good, unity can be so hard. I always expected family life, or roommate life, to just feel like a basket of kittens. So why aren’t we all adorably snuggling and saying meow, meow already?\n\nThe early church had the same problems with unity that we have today. Paul tries to halt their squabbling by reminding them of this key truth: Christ is the cornerstone. Obviously your house is going to fall down if it’s not built on the cornerstone. Unity is enormously difficult, and the only way to have unity with each other is through Christ.\n\nBecause the folks in Ephesus were so busy slapping and kicking each other in the shins over whether or not circumcision is the one true way to salvation, Paul uses metaphors to get their attention and gives them a veritable technicolor slideshow of unity.\n\nPaul actually uses illustrations like this a lot in his letters, to deepen our understanding of our relationship to each other in Christ. Look how many I found with only a quick, cursory search:\n\nTogether, in Christ, we are:\n\na holy sanctuary (Ephesians 2:21, 1 Corinthians 3:16) \na body (Ephesians 2:15)\na city (Ephesians 2:19)\na family (Ephesians 2:19, Galatians 3:26, 29)\ncovered (Galatians 3:27)\nsons, not slaves (Galatians 3:23-26)\na creation (Galatians 6:15)\n\nWhew! As I noticed that Paul really rolled out the whole barrel of metaphors, I realized this concept of unity in Christ must require more than just passing consideration. It demands real attention to the texture of this truth, like we could comprehend more if we examine it from different angles. Let’s look at three of these pictures of unity together today.\n\nI am most intrigued by the picture of us as family in Christ (Ephesians 2:19). The issue of seamless family connection has always plagued me because I, like many of you, come from a home of divorce. So my family isn’t tidy or shiny; it’s funny and sometimes awkward. But Paul is saying we are “members of the household of God.” We have a rightful place, together, in Him.\n\nI’m also fascinated to think of us as a holy sanctuary (Ephesians 2:21). We are joined together to make a holy temple for the Lord. Together we are a place that is set apart, a place that God loves. It’s amazing.\n\nFinally, we can see our unity in the image of the city (Ephesians 2:19). I really like this one. In a city, everyone does different jobs, but it works because we are pulling together, just like we learned on Sesame Street. Except this unity works because we are in Christ—not because we are motivated by civic duty.\n\nGod brought the Jews and the Gentiles together. He’s still doing it today. He’s bringing the Hatfields and the McCoys together. He’s bringing me and my crazy family together. It’s super messy and complicated. Honestly, it’s horribly messy.\n\nHere we are, and God wants us all to be His people. Me, you, and your lunatic uncle. How can we all come together? In Christ. Christ is our cornerstone. We build on Him. He is the only source of unity.\n\nBefore you get out your mortar and trowel to start building, remember that unity comes from the Lord, and it is begun and completed by Him. We can’t achieve unity by our good work or our hard work—but He achieves it by His grace!\n\nLord, bring unity to our families and our communities. Give us the humility to see that our hands aren’t enough to build the Kingdom, but that your hands have already built it. You are our cornerstone, and “in you we are made one” (John 17:22).\n\n \n\n",

And there was a bully who taunted Izzy and beat her up, starting in kindergarten by calling her teeth yellow, and continuing to senior year by calling her heart yellow.\n\nWhat a relief to graduate and move on! But then, on her wedding day, her tormenter showed up at the reception, uninvited, eager to share champagne, strawberries, and first dances with Izzy and her new husband. Izzy tried to ignore it. But when she and her beloved reached to cut the cake that symbolized their new life together, a third hand tenderly joined theirs on the knife. Izzy couldn’t take it any longer. She shouted:\n\nGET OUT OF MY SPECIAL MOMENT! This is our special covenant together, and you are not included!\n\nThis awkward narrative makes us so mad and squirmy, but this is how the people of Israel felt when the Gentiles came out of the woodwork to join the church. This is our wedding feast. Go find your own.\n\nThe term “Gentiles” pretty much means everybody who’s not Jewish. It meant the Egyptians, Medes, Persians, and Babylonians— all those guys who tossed Israel around like game of keep-away. These are the nations who bullied and slaughtered Israel on and off for half of the Old Testament. \n\nIsrael did not want anything to do with these bad guys. And they had always seen the promise of the covenant as specific and exclusive to Abraham and his descendants (Romans 11:1-2). When they sang “Father Abraham…had many sons…” they meant it literally and ethnically.\n\nThe idea of including the enemy in their special family covenant was radical and unwelcome. Why would Israel want all the mean and dirty Gentiles involved in their intimate covenant with God? Wasn’t He their God?\n\nPaul lovingly tries to bring them around to the idea. He argues that this was actually God’s plan from the beginning (Ephesians 3:11). And not only was it God’s plan, but it’s God’s great grace to the Jews to allow them to minister to the Gentiles. God gave them the opportunity to become more like Christ—to show grace (Ephesians 3:7-9). The Gentiles became fellow heirs in Christ. And I am so grateful, because any of us who don’t literally come from the “many sons” of Abraham are technically Gentiles too.\n\nThankfully, my husband and I didn’t have to share our special nuptial moments with an intruder, but ours is a small picture of a greater marriage. At the marriage supper of Lamb, we will sit side by side with people who wouldn’t have chosen us to attend their special moments on earth. At the moment the Jews start feeling possessive about the covenant as their own, Paul admonishes them that it’s only due to God’s great grace and kindness that they are at the marriage supper at all.\n\nThe same is true for you and me. Yes, the covenant is ours, but we are that creepy third-wheel bully that doesn’t deserve to be there. We all picture ourselves as the bride, but the big news of the gospel is this: I’m actually the problem in the story. We are the ones who have been undeservedly invited in.\n\nOh, the depth of the riches of both the wisdom and the knowledge of God (Romans 11:33)!  We receive the goodness of God’s truth, His grace, and His salvation, and we get to share it. We may be natural born enemies, but we are equal heirs to the inheritance of the gospel.\n\nAfter this I looked, and there was a vast multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language, which no one could number, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were robed in white with palm branches in their hands. –Revelation 7:9\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nA word to the wise: do not prank call my parents today to ask if their refrigerator is running.\n\nThat is, of course, unless you’d like to trigger their post-traumatic stress involving a certain recent refrigerator leak… turned flood… turned home renovation. It was a rough time, you guys. \n\nIn all seriousness, this Whirlpool really lived up to its name, creating a lagoon of lettuce water beneath the wooden floorboards, which curled up like soggy noodles. After clearing out all of the furniture and listening for weeks to the hum of many vacuums, my parents were relieved to make it to the simplest part of the process: choosing a replacement refrigerator. They ordered the model closest in appearance to its predecessor, measuring the length and width of the cabinet opening, checking and rechecking its size.\n\nIf you know anything about my dad, it’s that his yellow measuring tape is a force to be reckoned with. It’s always precise, down to the milli-est of meters. So it was with utmost confidence that my parents declared the dimensions of the new fridge’s home.\n\nBut when the delivery man placed the refrigerator in its compartment, there was a slight problem. Now, if you’re afraid I’m going to tell you the precious, yellow measuring tape was wrong, do not fear! Oh, it was correct. The length and width of the new Whirlpool slid snugly into the pocket where the former fridge once stood, but… it stuck out about 6 inches too far. While the length and width had been calculated to the exact millimeter, no one had considered the depth.\n\nEach time my parents step foot in the kitchen, they are stonewalled by the refrigerator’s annoying edge, an ever-present reminder of their miscalculation.\n\nWhen I read Paul’s words in Ephesians 3, I imagine they are the kind he’d like us to place in a conspicuous spot in our homes, maybe with magnets on the refrigerator:\n\n“I pray that you, being rooted and firmly established in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the length and width, height and depth of God’s love…” –Ephesians 3:17-18\n\nWe can guess that Paul, being the energetic guy we all know and love, didn’t intend these words to be admired only during our late-night cookie-dough raids. No, I think he was calling us out on our own miscalculations about God’s love.\n\nIf we, as Christ’s followers, understand and proclaim one thing about God, shouldn’t it be His love?\n\nSince love is the currency and cornerstone of our faith, and others will know we are Christians by that love (John 13:35), we’d like to think we have that part all figured out. But what if we don’t? Are we doing love wrong?\n\nPaul gives us this assurance: God’s love cannot be constrained by our own lack of understanding. God guarantees that His love will always obnoxiously stick out further than we think, bumping into our warm, fuzzy expectations with a reminder of Himself.\n\nIts length embraces us in a wingspan of Alpha to Omega.\nIts width includes us in the family tree of all believers.\nIts depth reaches us buried beneath the wages of sin.\nIts height draws us to eternal heavenly glory.\n\nLove establishes and anchors us in the gospel. It is longer, wider, deeper and higher than any dimensions we can muster. We can spend our days settling for a comfortable, comprehendible love, or we can seek to be stretched by the true fullness of His love.\n\nToday, may we make a space for Him to surprise us without limitation, so that we may see the true length, width, depth and height of the Father’s love. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nI’m a beach girl. I love the sun, the sand, the surf—everything. I can’t get enough. Recently, my brother moved to Jacksonville, Florida, and I’ve had the privilege of free beach vacations the last few years. Yes, please!\n\nWhile visiting my brother this past summer there was a tropical storm about 200 miles off the coast. Those were some of the biggest and most consistent waves I’ve ever seen.\n\nMy brother ran through the water and easily made it out to a calm sandbar. As I tried get out past the breaking point, the waves continually knocked me backwards, sideways, and underwater. Just when I made a little progress, an enormous swell came into view. In an effort to hit it head-on, I started running toward it, jumping forward and diving into the wave.\n\nAs the wave rolled over, it rolled me right along with it. Suddenly, I was somersaulting underneath the wave, no control over my body and no idea which way was up. I finally found my footing and came up from under the water. But as soon as I took a breath, another wave knocked me off my feet and pushed me even closer to shore.\n\nNeedless to say, I waved to my brother and went back to our towels. This was definitely a tanning day.\n\nThat feeling of no control, of not knowing if you’ll ever surface, doesn’t just happen in the water and the waves. It’s one we can experience spiritually, too. If we remain immature in our faith, we can easily be tossed back and forth by the craftiness, manipulation, and deceit of false teachers.\n\nSo how do we guard against this? According to Paul, our spiritual gifts play a huge role.\n\nChrist grants each believer unique gifts in order to serve the body of Christ. We are all created differently and given different gifts by our Creator, so that together we can work to reach unity in the faith and in our knowledge and understanding of Jesus Christ. In Christ, our diversity is an asset and, ultimately, a peace-maker.\n\nChrist’s design for spiritual gifts is to build up His Bride, the Church. The goal is for the body of Christ—the whole body— to reach maturity. Using our gifts in the right context, with a humble and willing heart, builds us up individually and collectively. It builds up the whole body of believers.\n\nThis is what Paul urges of the Ephesians: in order for the body to reach maturity, we must fully embrace the unity to which Christ has called us. His desire is for us to function as one, not function alone.\n\nI love Paul’s words in Philippians 1:27 which echo this calling, charging us to live in “a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ.” We are to stand firm with one mind and spirit, guarding each other, using our unique gifts, and working side by side as we advance the gospel.\n\nIn this way, Christ’s Bride will be presented, fully mature and unified, on the day of glory.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Vivian Mabuni\n\nI picked up a crumpled foil gum wrapper by the staircase. Three steps up I found another one. And then another. At the top of the stairs I found a few more. Curiosity piqued, I turned the corner to peer into my son’s room. Under a maroon-colored blanket I saw the shape of a preschooler. In front of the mound of blanket-covered-preschooler, I found a pile of gum wrappers. I walked up to the mound.\n\n“Michael? Are you under the blanket?”\n\nThe shape shook his head.\n\n“Michael? Are you chewing gum?”\n\nAgain, the shape shook his head.\n\nI lifted the blanket to find my son, cheeks stuffed like a chipmunk. His mouth was so full, he couldn’t bring his lips to close. Barely able to chew, Michael had managed to stuff an entire pack of chewing gum in his mouth.\n\nWhen it comes to sin, I’m not so different from my preschool-aged son. Like Adam and Eve in the garden, my first response to sin is to hide and cover (Genesis 3:7-10). Instead of an actual blanket, I often hide under a cloak of defensiveness or rationalization when I sin. You know what happens in the place of hiding and covering? Rotting, stinky, cold, isolated living—that’s what happens in the darkness.\n\nPaul brilliantly establishes in the first half of Ephesians our position in Christ and then spends the remainder of the letter addressing the practice of the Christian life. Our position should inform our practice, but often we confuse the order and attempt Christian conduct apart from understanding our standing before God. When we flip practice and position, we may seek to adhere to stringent dos and don’ts out of fear, or to earn brownie points. But living the Christian life through self-effort is unsustainable.\n\nGod did not abandon us to live the Christian life in our own strength. He is our Source and Provider. We invest time studying God’s Word in order to know Him, not just know about Him. As we know Him, we will love, trust, and obey Him, and our conduct flows out of this love relationship. We know Him by walking in the light, and we walk in the light by knowing Him.\n\nWhat’s more, God provides His Spirit to empower us to walk in the Light. The secret of the Christian life is being filled by and walking in the Spirit (Ephesians 5:18, Galatians 5:16), which comes through confessing our sin and yielding our lives to God in response to His goodness and mercy (Psalm 145:9). The word “confess” comes from a word meaning “to speak the same.” Speaking the same about our sin is to admit we blew it. No rationalization, no excuses, no hiding, no hiding under the blanket of our shame— only recognizing the beautiful truth that our forgiveness is complete because of Christ’s finished work on the cross.\n\nWhen we know our position— children of God who are forgiven, renewed, and provided for in Christ Jesus — then we can practice walking in the light, being imitators of the God who created us and saves us (Ephesians 5:1).\n\nLike lifting the blanket to expose my gum-chewing son, the gospel of Christ gives us the freedom to throw off our old sinful nature and be renewed by the Spirit (Ephesians 4:22-23). The darkness may feel deceivingly comfortable to us for a time, but true healing, freedom, warmth, connection, and community only happen in the light of Christ.\n\nFather, we want to know you and walk in the light. Show us through your Spirit the places in our heart where we hide and cover. Give us courage to yield our whole lives to you. Thank you for your perfect timing and perfect provision. We love you. Amen.\n\n \n\nVivian Mabuni is an author and speaker, and a sushi, white Christmas lights, coffee-with-friends-lover.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nShe was five and I was seven. The sun had just set, but there was light enough for our tasks. We had rhubarb leaves to gather, Rose of Sharon flowers to collect, and lightning bugs to catch. She ran back and forth with a run as cute as it was enthusiastic. I sat enthroned on an industrial wood spool and shouted orders: “Not those flowers, those are Queen Anne’s Lace!” We were storing up treasures and there was a lot of work for us to do. Well, work for her to do. Someone had to manage the operation, and if seven years had taught me nothing else, they had taught me that I loved to be the boss.\n\nMy little sister has always been game to help me achieve my goals. Whether I’m filling baskets with pink flowers or purchasing a new sofa, she’s got my back. But it’s taken me a long time to learn how to fully appreciate our relationship and not turn it into a power play.\n\nWe all have a little megalomania in us, whether we are the big sister or not. We all have an impulse to control. Henry Cloud points out that “all people were designed by God to be control freaks. But because we shy away from controlling what we are supposed to control (ourselves), we resort to controlling what we are not supposed to control (others).”\n\nOuch.\n\nWhen Paul addressed the Ephesians, he wasn’t just delivering a few tips for getting along with friends and coworkers; he was revealing how the gospel transforms all of our relationships. The gospel takes the power struggle out of the equation.\n\nOur sinful hearts are naturally inclined to rebel against authority. It’s (profoundly) hard for wives to submit to husbands, children want to rebel against parents, and who hasn’t had a hard time respecting a boss? (Ok, I know this passage also talks about slaves and masters, but I just can’t even right now with the complex issue of Old Testament slavery.) We squirm and wiggle to get out from under authority.\n\nOn the other side, our sinful hearts are inclined to control those under us. Husbands control and hurt wives, and wives undermine and control husbands. Parents try to control and micromanage their children, and employers steamroll workers all the time. We don’t want to submit, and we don’t want to lead with mercy.\n\nHere’s the good news: the gospel actually does change our relationships. It changes the nature of both our intimate and professional bonds. Yes, our sinful hearts want to control others and rebel against authority, but God only calls us to control ourselves (Galatians 5:23).\n\nHow can we control ourselves and understand this mystery of love, submission, and authority? Two ideas from scripture: Do a good job with a good heart.\n\nPaul encourages us to do a good job by enjoining us, “Don’t work only while being watched, in order to please men, but as slaves of Christ, do God’s will from your heart” (Ephesians 6:6).\n\nAnd Paul invites us to have a good heart: “Whatever you do, do it enthusiastically, as something done for the Lord and not for men, knowing that you will receive the reward of an inheritance from the Lord” (Colossians 3:23-24).\n\nBut our hearts are precisely the problem! How can I do a good job with a good heart when my  heart so bent on controlling others? The gospel never sets works before the transformed heart. It begins with Christ’s transforming work in my heart. Christ is the one who does all this.\n\nWhy does Paul go to all this trouble? To help us sort out little peccadillos with coworkers? To keep kids from getting out of hand in the grocery store? To help me not be grouchy to my husband?\n\nYeah, actually. Yes. All our relationships are about Christ. They mirror different facets of our connection to Him, so these interactions with other folks are like a training ground. We are learning to love Christ better through our relationships on earth. This mystery is profound (Ephesians 5:32).\n\nHelp your little sister when she’s gathering rhubarb, and listen to your mom if she calls you inside. God gave these people to you. When that old impulse to control strikes, use it to control yourself by submitting your heart to Christ.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nYou and I could gather around our screens and Bibles today like we were kids in Sunday school, felt board placed front and center. We’d label the felt man with his felt armor, giving each other a pep talk about putting on the full armor of God— not that shoddy, DIY armor we tend to wear. Then we’d retire to the Fellowship Hall for breakfast casserole while the choir practiced in the next room.\n\nThe conversation (and the casserole) would be worthwhile, but I’m wondering if today we might dig a little deeper into the text together.\n\nWhat is this spiritual battle Paul has us suiting up for in the first place? To find the answer, let’s hop over to Revelation 12.\n\nThe text describes a dramatic event where “the ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the one who deceives the whole world” is thrown out of heaven with all his angels (Revelation 12:12). We know how the story ends: death and Satan are conquered by perfect sacrifice of Jesus, the Lamb, on the cross (Amen!). But where is the Defeated One now? Look at Revelation 12:11-12:\n\nThey conquered him\nby the blood of the Lamb…\n\nTherefore rejoice, you heavens,\nand you who dwell in them!\nWoe to the earth and the sea,\nfor the Devil has come down to you\nwith great fury,\nbecause he knows he has a short time.\n\nPaul entreated the Ephesians to dress for battle because the battle is real and ongoing. The evil one has been defeated, but he is not going down without a fight. He lives to destroy goodness and steal the true life that only the Christ can bring (John 10:10).\n\nThis is no ordinary battle, and it calls for extraordinary armor.\n\nBut wait! Before we suit up and give it the ole college try, putting forth our very best efforts (ahem) to fight for victory, let’s remind each other of a few, very important things.\n\nFirst, the victory has already been won by Jesus. We know the outcome of this battle. Our efforts do not win the victory. Christ’s life, death, and resurrection won the victory (1 Corinthians 15:15).\n\nSecondly, you and I are not average soldiers. We are co-heirs with the Great High Priest, children of the undefeated King! The armor described by Paul in Ephesians 6:14-17 bears striking resemblance to the high priestly garb described in Exodus 28. What’s more, check out how the prophet Isaiah described the coming Messiah, our Jesus:\n\nRighteousness will be a belt around His loins;\nfaithfulness will be a belt around His waist. \n–Isaiah 11:5\n\nHe put on righteousness like a breastplate,\nand a helmet of salvation on His head;\nHe put on garments of vengeance for clothing,\nand He wrapped Himself in zeal as in a cloak. \n–Isaiah 59:17\n\nSound familiar? And, the Old Testament often describes God as a shield:\n\nAfter these events, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision:\nDo not be afraid, Abram.\nI am your shield… –Genesis 15:1a\n\nHow happy you are, Israel!\nWho is like you,\na people saved by the Lord?\nHe is the shield that protects you,\nthe sword you boast in.\nYour enemies will cringe before you,\nand you will tread on their backs. \n–Deuteronomy 33:29\n\nAs for the feet? The high priests donned bare feet because they stood on holy ground. And, of course, bare feet were Jesus’ jam (John 13:4-5).\n\nNow, back to Paul’s letter: he already reminded the believers of their new spiritual clothing two chapters earlier. “You took off the old self,” he said, and “you put on the new self” in Christ (Ephesians 4:22-24). He wrote it in his letter to the Romans, too: “Put on the Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 13:14).\n\nDo you see it? This armor is all His— His truth, His righteousness, His salvation, His Word. He fought the battle and won, and He laid the armor of victory on us.\n\nSo, yes— suit up today. Put that felt helmet, shield, and belt on your little felt figure. Pray earnestly at all times and “with every prayer and request,” just like Paul describes (Ephesians 6:18). Pray for boldness—not to proclaim all the answers, but to proclaim the mysterious gospel (Ephesians 6:19). \n\nIt is indeed a battle—a battle both won and ongoing—but you and I were made to fight it. Not by armor of our own making, but by the already tried and true armor of the Mighty One, our High Priest, our Messiah and King.\n\nMay our feet spread His gospel as long as we have breath.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nNot everyone makes dinners from scratch. Nor do they set the table while singing folk songs in four-part harmony, no less. No, not everyone does these things. But the Trudeau family does. And years ago, when disease broke into their family, my friends still continued to welcome people into their home, investing great care and attention into making their space a refuge since so much of their time would be spent there due to illness. \n\nReceiving an invitation to dinner at the Trudeaus’ home is special because there are just so many things for them to juggle on an average night, let alone one with company—a warm hearth for cold bodies, hand-crafted dairy-free dressings, detoxifying herbal tea, gentle noise levels. But their home has always been a warm place because this family is the essence of hospitality. When you leave, it feels like you’ve actually been touched by grace and peace. Not merely abstract concepts on a page, grace and peace are felt in the Trudeaus’ home—as real as the gift of hospitality, evidenced by their thoughtfulness and intention, not to mention the gloriously sautéed pork chops or a round of acapella sing-a-longs.\n\nIn Paul’s letter to the Philippians, he begins by giving them something: “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (Philippians 1:2). It may seem like a simple greeting, similar to “Hello!” or “Nice to see you!” But the phrase carries more spiritual depth along with it. In Paul’s day, letters were the primary way to convey personal information from afar. It wasn’t like today, where you can text your relatives across the world or confess your love on Facebook Messenger and, best-case scenario, hear back within the hour. Because writing and sending letters required valuable commodities, there was often more intentionality behind it. \n\nPaul’s message to the believers in Philippi was even more important because his words were the closest he could get to being there with them in person. Being imprisoned, he wanted to thank this church for their financial support and faithful friendship, for being his partners in the gospel (Philippians 1:5). And after personally experiencing the grace of God and His peace that surpassed all understanding (Philippians 4:7), Paul desired for his brothers and sisters in Christ to experience these things too.\n\nWhen Paul wrote to the saints in Philippi, he extended a spiritual blessing. Both “grace” and “peace” were common salutations in Paul’s day, but he reimagined the phrase and used it to remind his readers of the gifts already imparted to them by God’s Spirit. By greeting fellow believers in this way, Paul encouraged them to remember what was theirs in Christ Jesus. \n\nMay we seize these blessings from Paul’s church greeting, remembering that grace and peace are real and active gifts that the Father gives to us through the Holy Spirit and makes accessible through His Son. They are ours today, if only we would receive them. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nEarly into this past Advent season, I wrote letters until the ring finger on my right hand blistered. For two days straight, I wrote cards of gratitude and joy for each of the volunteers in the children’s ministry I lead, followed by cards filled with stickers and sweet words for every child (ages three and over) in my ministry. In each child’s card, I wrote a variation on a similar theme, but all had the same conclusion: “I hope you always remember how much Jesus loves you.”\n\nI assume these cards were tossed aside in the holiday hubbub, or purged in the seemingly requisite January clean-out that most families undertake. As I wrote, I kept thinking, Do these words matter? Is it worth the time? Maybe the cards matter, maybe they don’t, but I know the words on them do. And every time I penned that phrase, I prayed the child who received the card would take it to heart. \n\nPaul’s letter to the Philippians starts with similar sentiments, echoing ancient truths and the hope that the words within the letter would sink down deep into the hearts of those who would read it. This opening exhortation to his readers in Philippi offers a template for godly relationships of believers deeply committed to sharing the love of Christ. Paul expressed gratitude for the Philippians, “for every remembrance” of them (Philippians 1:3), as well as their partnership in the spread of the gospel. \n\nPaul has a history with the Philippians, and it is on this rich foundation that he builds this really beautiful letter. In Acts 16, we see that when Paul first came to Philippi, a woman called Lydia was converted to faith, and then she and her family invited Paul to stay with them. Their generous hospitality was marked by open ears, open hearts, and open homes. \n\nLater in the chapter, Paul and Silas were arrested, and in the end, the Lord delivered them from prison. However, during their imprisonment, one of their jailers became a believer, and also welcomed Paul and Silas to his home: “He brought them into his house, set a meal before them, and rejoiced because he had come to believe in God with his entire household” (Acts 16:34). \n\nPaul seems to care very deeply for the Philippians. As modern readers, we know the rest of this letter will hold both caution and affection. But this beautiful opening reveals the heart and intent behind Paul’s words. We see in these verses how godly relationships work when they are anchored in love for the gospel; there is push and pull, earnest prayer, and deep care for one other’s true well-being and spiritual growth. \n\nAs I write, I see the faces of those believers who I know I can cling to with the same godly affection Paul has for the Philippians, who balance their love for me with their desire for me to grow more like Jesus every day. They aren’t afraid to whisper (or shout) rebuke in love, and they bathe their strong words in prayer for my sanctification. These people have partnered with me in the hard work of sharing the gospel with a world that has become increasingly hostile toward it. \n\nI am so thankful for these friends, and today I pray for them in the same way Paul prayed for his friends in Philippi: “that [their] love will keep on growing in knowledge and every kind of discernment,” and that they would “be pure and blameless in the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God” (Philippians 1:9–11). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nYears ago, I gave a talk about fear and anxiety. About thirty women settled into a cozy room as I began sharing some of my story. Looking back on my childhood, I see a little girl who wanted to play it safe, who perpetually problem-solved worst-case scenarios, one who felt shadowed by a vague sense of fear. This stream of anxiety ran steadily throughout my life, but no one would have known. I was the kid who easily made friends, loved school, and didn’t cause much trouble. I was the strong, steady one—until I wasn’t.\n\nIn my late twenties, in the midst of young marriage and new motherhood, the stream of anxiety became a flood. Panic attacks began to torment me. For the first time, my underground anxiety burst out and threatened to take center stage. I felt embarrassed and ashamed. I didn’t want to admit my confusing fears, and I certainly didn’t want others to see my struggle. After all, I was supposed to be the strong, steady one. \n\nAt this point in my talk, I told the women that I had a secret. I began unbuttoning my shirt. Awkward silence filled the room. Underneath my faded, denim top I wore a white t-shirt and cold, bulky metal chains. No one had suspected that I was wearing chains, yet they were there the whole time—pinching, constraining, and weighing me down. We don’t always know the chains people are wrapped up in, do we?\n\nThe apostle and missionary Paul wore chains too. In his letter to the believers in the city of Philippi, Paul explains that he is “in chains for Christ” as he endures house arrest (Philippians 1:13 NIV). For years he has been misunderstood, criticized, slandered, and beaten, and now he is jailed in Rome. \n\nSome could view Paul as a failure. Some could question his faith or even the power or goodness of God. Yet Paul is convinced that his current suffering is nothing to be ashamed of or to hide. On the contrary, he insists that his circumstances advance the gospel message. He tells the Philippians, “Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly” (Philippians 1:14 NIV). Even in jail, Paul rejoices that his guards are hearing about Jesus and that other believers are encouraged and empowered. \n\nWe may marvel at Paul’s perspective, but let’s not romanticize our chains. In 1 Corinthians 2, Paul reveals his weakness, fear, and trembling (v.3). We all chafe and wrestle with painful circumstances, those things we would never choose for ourselves, yet God still allows. \n\nWhat pinches you, constrains you, or weighs you down? Our anxieties, our fears, our sufferings are heavy and costly. But we don’t have to hide them or be ashamed. Even our struggles can deepen our dependence on Christ and point others to the one who walks us through our darkest valleys and who redeems us—chains and all. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jen Rose Yokel\n\n“So, have I missed anything during my Twitter vacation?” I asked my husband, half joking, half serious. Every January, I take an annual social media break. Whatever I call this—a fast, a disappearance, a protest, a spiritual practice, an act of self-care—I’m always astonished how the break makes my world feel quieter. It’s sobering to notice how I’m being shaped by the constant noise of life online. And I wonder how Jesus might be calling all of us to a better, humbler way.\n\nIn His letter to the church at Philippi, Paul has quite a bit to say on the subject of humility. He writes, “Consider others as more important than yourselves” (Philippians 2:3), before drawing comparisons to Jesus Himself in 2:5–7. \n\nIf this tempts you to empty yourself into silence or challenges your natural fighter instinct, please know this isn’t an invitation to be passive. Jesus was a man who frequently challenged power, debating religious leaders and touching the unclean, and defending the dignity of people on the margins of life. So no, humility isn’t about shrinking into invisibility. There are certainly things worth fighting for.\n\nPerhaps humility is more of a posture. And if humility is our posture and Christ is our example, then we can walk in love and know how to respond when we come up against the messiness of the world, acting from a place of love and security rather than reacting. We can know when to rage against the darkness and when to be still.\n\nWe can also learn when to sit and listen. We can fight the darkness while honoring each other’s humanity. We can acknowledge that even the corrupt and the cruel are loved by a God who grieves for them, who longs to lead them out of the darkness and welcome them as sons and daughters.\n\nSo, the social media thing? You don’t have to scroll far to see the human tendency to posture with pride. I see it when I ask a question and I’m already planning what to say next. I see it when my love for a person cools because I don’t like their behavior online. I see it when we slip into performative debates for the cultural currency of likes and retweets.\n\nIn life online and off, what would it look like to look out for the interests of others before my own? How might we learn to consider others with more importance, even when we disagree? What kinds of questions ought we learn to ask before we speak? And how will it empower us to know when our words really matter?\n\nQuestions like these might help to foster humility. And no doubt, we need the help because humility is a hard way. But it’s also one we don’t have to walk alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nIt was an early morning in June when I logged into my work computer at our university library. I hadn’t been online for more than a minute before seeing tributes pouring in from church leaders, moms, and others whose lives have been enriched by this one woman and her heart for God. Elisabeth Elliot had died. \n\nElisabeth’s writing helped guide my spiritual formation after I stumbled across her work somewhere around the age of twenty years old. An American missionary, wife, author, and speaker, she was a modest saint, one who would never call attention to herself. She saw our lives as “chalices” or “empty vessels willing and ready to be filled with the life of God.” But on this June morning, people seemed to think it right to honor her long walk of faithfulness. \n\nDuring his missionary journeys, the apostle Paul honored his ministry partners in a similar way by speaking well of them. When he wrote to groups like the one in Philippi, he vouched for his friends and elevated their good qualities so there would be no question of their credibility. Timothy was a “like-minded” man doing the Lord’s work with “proven character” (Philippians 2:20, 22; 1 Corinthians 16:10). Epaphroditus was his “brother” who should be welcomed with “great joy” (Philippians 2:25, 29). Paul also asked these churches to recognize and hold in high regard those among them who were risking their lives for the kingdom (1 Thessalonians 5:12–13). \n\nJesus tells us, “You will have suffering in the world.” (John 16:33). I’ve always found it strange when we describe life as having seasons of trials and tribulations. Instead of life being a static plane of serenity with intermittent times of trial, it sometimes seems that life itself is the trial with intermittent times of serenity. One thing that gives us strength while following Jesus is our friendship with others and their encouragement on the journey. \n\nI hope people pointed out the good they saw in Elisabeth Elliot while she was alive. I imagine that her modest personality was challenged now and then by opportunities to focus on affirmation from others. But even if not, I hope her story inspires us to follow Paul’s model and affirm the God-honoring qualities we see in our brothers and sisters. This isn’t to draw self-serving attention or make them arrogant; it’s an opportunity to build up the Body of Christ in a world so often marked by anything but serenity.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nWhen my husband was in business school, he had to develop an “elevator pitch” as part of his job search. An elevator pitch is a fairly standard business practice with the goal of selling something (a business idea, a person for a job, or a product) in the amount of time it takes you to ride an elevator with someone. For my husband and his fellow students, the idea was simple. At career fairs with large companies who hired the best and brightest from top business schools, you need to make yourself stand out in thirty seconds or less: say who you are, why you are different, and why you can bring unique value to the company. \n\nIn the first eleven verses of Philippians 3, Paul offers his own succinct and beautiful elevator pitch for gospel transformation. He lays it all out, right there: who he was, who he is now, and why it matters.\n\nSo who was Paul? He was the Hebrew born of Hebrews, who said of himself, “If anyone else thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I have more” (Philippians 3:4). Paul, a Pharisee whose life mission was to persecute and kill Christians, had all the right answers. He followed the law, which he knew backward and forward and to the letter. \n\nBut when confronted firsthand and face to face with the truth of who Jesus really is, Paul declared, “Everything that was a gain to me, I have considered to be a loss because of Christ” (v.7). Despite the perfect resumé, the right pedigree, the unflappable credentials—Paul had nothing to offer before God. What a radical gospel transformation Paul experienced! It’s incredible, his confidence in the gift of grace that Christ offers to us. \n\nI often feel so very lost in the darkness of my own sin. I know I have nothing to offer, despite my best efforts. But this confidence Paul describes? I don’t always believe it is available to me, too. My brain and its twisted paths of anxiety, fear, too many words and not enough faith, often lead me down the road of relying on my own flesh. I reason, I’m not good enough for God, but if I work harder, read my Bible more, pray more, be nicer to people, maybe then I’ll become more like Christ.\n\nBut here, in his eleven-verse elevator pitch for the gospel, Paul reminds me again that those thoughts are not true. My righteousness cannot come from my own flesh or from the law, but only through faith in Christ (vv.9–10). Jeremiah 9:23–24 echoes the same promise: \n\nThe wise person should not boast in his wisdom;  the strong should not boast in his strength;  the wealthy should not boast in his wealth.  But the one who boasts should boast in this:  that he understands and knows me— that I am the LORD.\n\nHe is the Lord, mighty to save and full of abounding grace. What He requires from us is a desire “to know Him and the power of His resurrection” (Philippians 3:10), a power that is available to all who receive the gospel of grace. May we remember, and always be thankful for, the privilege of being able to stand on the merit of Christ alone. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jen Rose Yokel\n\nThere’s a quote attributed to Maya Angelou that somehow gives comfort to my inner critic: “I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.” I’m not sure if these are actual words written by Dr. Angelou or if it’s one of those quotes that has been passed around so much on Instagram nobody knows the true source. But wherever it comes from, I like it. Something in it resonates with me, an echo of much-needed grace.\n\nI’d like to think this is a message someone in the church at Phillippi needed to hear when Paul’s letter came to town. In Philippians, Paul isn’t writing to correct an issue or fight a dangerous teaching. Instead, he’s sent an extended thank-you letter, a note of encouragement, and a rally to keep going.\n\nMetaphors about running races and winning prizes aren’t all that unusual in Paul’s writing, but if we look a bit more closely, we’ll find the words of a gentle, loving coach here. His letter to the Philippians includes a heartfelt thank you for their support, and the reminder that there is still so much work to do for the kingdom (Philippians 1:21–24). He points to Jesus’s obedience unto literal death as the ultimate example of humility (Philippians 2:8), a stark contradiction to his own list of credentials for “confidence in the flesh,” which is enough to make any zealous striver or recovering perfectionist wither. It’s also a false confidence Paul now recognizes as utterly empty (Philippians 3:4–6). His priorities have changed. \n\nYes, there is work. There is effort. There is a goal to pursue, a race to run, a job to do (Philippians 3:12–13). But look for the grace between the words: there is no striving in his words. Paul calls this way of thinking a mark of maturity—the realization that all we need is God. This is not the anxious striving to appease an angry Father. This is not fearfully walking on eggshells. Instead, Paul appeals to his readers’ identity as “citizens of heaven,” and encourages them to “live up to whatever truth we have [already] attained” (Philippians 1:27; 3:16).\n\nAnd so, there is the tension: to work hard for God’s purposes, but trust that Christ has taken hold of us. To embrace our identity as kingdom citizens, while knowing we won’t live this life perfectly, nor could we ever earn our way back into a right relationship with God. To be content where we are while seeking to grow, and trusting that when the time is right, the Holy Spirit will reveal truth and nudge us in the direction that will lead us to look more like Jesus. “Forgetting what is behind and reaching forward to what is ahead,” we learn to pursue the ultimate prize: Christ Jesus Himself (Philippians 3:13–14).\n\nWe grow. We learn. We know better. We do better. Until the day we step into the kingdom and the breeze on our faces feels like home.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nThe blaring siren and flashing blue lights jerked me out of my daydream. How fast was I driving, anyway? Turns out I was cruising along at 53 miles an hour in a 40-mile-an-hour zone. And it wasn’t the first time. There’s a reason my dad often told me I had “a lead foot.” This time, the police officer was firm yet gracious. He urged me to keep my speed down, but let me off with a warning instead of a costly ticket. \n\nI may sometimes be too speedy, but nothing compared to Mario Andretti, the professional racecar driver. He would regularly race at speeds over 200 miles an hour. When asked for a racing tip, he quipped, “Don’t look at the wall.” His point was that a driver’s car follows what he is focused on. Where you look is where you go. If you keep looking at the wall, you’ll crash into it.\n\nIn his letter to the church in Philippi, Paul is urging the impressionable believers to keep their focus on Christ. Paul longs for them to flourish in the faith, not to crash into walls of false teaching. In chapter 2, Paul warns the church against legalism. This deception rejected the sufficiency of Christ’s righteousness that comes from God through faith. Then and now, legalistic thinking insists that it’s a person’s best efforts and striving that make them right with God and with other people. I crash into a wall of legalism when I assume God merely tolerates me instead of remembering that He deeply delights in me as His beloved daughter. I crash when I’m critical and judge others for not meeting my personal expectations and preferences.\n\nIn chapter 3, Paul warns against another danger. While speeding away from the wall of legalism, some may over-correct and ricochet into the wall of licentiousness. This deception insists on throwing off moral restraint in hopes of satisfying all appetites and desires. “Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is their shame,” says Paul (Philippians 3:19). Licentiousness says “anything goes,” that if it feels good, you should do it. I crash into a wall of licentiousness when I pridefully believe that I’m above temptation and fail to recognize my need for God’s good boundaries. I crash when I foolishly allow my desires to drive me to do things that hurt myself and hurt others.\n\nAt the root of all legalism and licentiousness is a worship of self above all else. Paul is, in essence, warning, “Don’t look at the wall!” Where you look is where you go. When we focus on ourselves, it’s not long before we crash. But this does not need to rule us. We can stand firm in the Lord as we remember that our true citizenship, our true allegiance, is in heaven with God (Philippians 3:20). May the Lord capture our hearts and affections, enabling us to focus on Him, worshiping Him alone. The One who made us is also the only One who can save us. Only He truly satisfies our deepest longings and desires, and only He can safely lead us home.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kimberly Girard\n\nCompany was coming to town, the house was in disarray, I had mounds of laundry and cooking before me, and I was apologizing to my 10-year-old daughter for being impatient. She gave me a hug and said, “Mom, look at the things you have finished, not the things you haven’t.” In essence, the Lord was graciously reminding me, through my daughter, to “rejoice in the Lord always”—in everything—even while in the midst of a list of to-dos (Philippians 4:4). \n\nAs daughters of the King, rather than living in worry and fear, we can rejoice in “the riches of his grace that he richly poured out on us with all wisdom and understanding” (Ephesians 1:8–9). I don’t know about you, but so often, I live in and wrestle with worry. When I hear that command to rejoice, I fall into discouragement because I know my life’s not marked by rejoicing. Paul was in prison when he wrote “Rejoice!” So why can’t I rejoice where I am today? I spin my wheels trying to figure out how to cultivate a life of joy and peace. Today’s reading reminds me that the answers to how we live this life of faith are found in God’s Word. \n\nGod knows how to bring us peace because He is the God of peace (Philippians 4:9). He knows what will bring us true joy. He is always near, and so there’s no reason to worry; His peace will guard our hearts and minds (vv.5–9). \n\nWe cannot add one moment to our days by worrying, and so we are to set our minds on the Spirit, who offers us “life and peace” (Matthew 6:27; Romans 8:6). Whatever is true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, commendable—these are the things we should dwell on (Philippians 4:8). All of these things and more we are able to receive through His Spirit and His Word; He uses both to draw us to Himself.\n\nWill we continue to worry, to set our minds on things of the flesh? Yes, we may always struggle with that. But we are saved by grace, works in progress; the One who’s begun a good work in us will carry it on to completion (Philippians 1:6). And that is truly a great cause for rejoicing, because “as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us” (Psalm 103:12). Wherever we find ourselves today—even in dark seasons and in overwhelming situations—we can rest in Him and rejoice because the gospel is true.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jen Rose Yokel\n\nSome call it “liminal space,” the time or space between what has been and what lies ahead. It might be a time of waiting or even transformation. These places can be painful or beautiful: a time of singleness or the joyful, anticipated waiting during engagement. The days of longing for children or the day after the youngest leaves for college. The darkness of depression or the lifting of anxiety. In these uncertain places, how can we learn to be content?\n\nIt’s likely that Paul wrote his famous declaration of contentment from inside the walls of a Roman prison, and yet his words brim with gratitude. His friends in Philippi were concerned, doing what they could to help him, and he acknowledged that just knowing they care is enough. He tells them, “I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I find myself. I know both how to make do with little, and I know how to make do with a lot” (Philippians 4:11–12). In other words, “Thanks for your concern, but don’t worry! I’m going to be okay.”\n\nIn this letter, Paul is warm and optimistic, shifting the focus off of himself to encourage a church. His words radiate joy and humility bound up in a deep truth. Contentment doesn’t lie in comfort, and it doesn’t even lie in freedom. In this liminal space between living free or dying a brutal death, Paul shares this secret from behind bars: “I am able to do all things through Him who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13).\n\nIn our own liminal spaces, maybe we can find a little bit of that strength too. Not in a naively optimistic way that ignores or denies reality, but in a solid confidence that someday this, too—everything, really—will be made right. And in this contentment, we can take the steps we need toward the changes we desire, from making friends in a new city, to scheduling a doctor appointment, to leaning on Him to get up and take each day one step at a time.\n\nConsider the journey of a caterpillar becoming a butterfly. This old metaphor of free-flying beauty springing forth from a squirmy, leaf-munching creature can sound a little cliché. But there’s a reason this image resonates and endures. The caterpillar doesn’t just spin a little capsule and pop out fully formed. It liquifies to a death-like state. It waits. It struggles to tear out of its chrysalis, strengthening its wings so it can fly. Stop the process too soon, or attempt to help a butterfly escape, and it’s over. Every step of the process is vital. \n\nPerhaps our own waiting spaces are like that. Changing, struggling, and finding contentment in the shelter of God—over and over again, until we are made completely new. But regardless of the space we currently inhabit, whether moving forward in a joyful burst of enthusiasm or in a seemingly endless season of waiting—we are not alone. “In any and all circumstances,” we already know the secret of being content: Jesus Christ is our peace. And by His Spirit we are strengthened and equipped, enabling us to do all things.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Colossians 1:1-2, Romans 1:7, 2 Corinthians 1:1, 1 John 3:1-2\n\nThere’s a monster in my closet named Anxiety. He’s been hanging around for about five years now, long enough that his presence no longer surprises me but not quite long enough for me to predict exactly when he’ll burst out the door, let alone what it will take to put him back in.\n\nHe appeared a few days ago when my husband and I were talking about a big, vague possibility that tore my stomach in knots for reasons I couldn’t quite identify. Anxiety kicked open the closet door and came out roaring, taunting me and tossing out lies faster than I could dodge them. My husband started taking aim at those lie grenades, knocking them out of the sky, one by one. He told me true things until I started to hear them, and eventually, Anxiety went sulking back to his closet and closed the door, defeated.\n\nLies are toxic. The only sure antidote is Truth.\n\nThe people in the newly-founded church at Colossae were under fire. They were a Christ-believing, gospel-professing people in a world that refuted the basic tenets of their faith. They worshipped God in a society that worshipped angels; they believed Jesus was the Son of God in a culture that believed all flesh and matter were evil. In the midst of a lie-shouting world, the church struggled to hold fast to faith and grow in the gospel. Sound familiar?\n\nPaul, from prison, put pen to paper to speak truth into the hearts and minds of this church family he had never met, but nevertheless held close at heart. His letter to the Colossian believers is a gospel antidote—an injection of truth to counter the heresy that confronted them.\n\nTo catch Paul’s vision and heart for this short, heartfelt letter, let’s take a moment to digest the opening verses:\n\n“To the saints in Christ at Colossae…”\n\nStraightaway, Paul identifies his audience, and boldly so. The word “saints” is no haphazardly applied label— this is gospel truth! The believers at Colossae were holy and set apart before God in Christ Jesus. (And friends, if we are in Christ, this bold label applies to us too! See Romans 8:16-17.)\n\n“…who are faithful brothers.”\n\nAs he often did, Paul used familial terms to reiterate his relationship to the men and women of the church, as well as their relationship to one another. The Body of Christ is created to live and serve with one another, modeling the gospel in how we love. [And don’t let the “brothers” throw you; Paul may have addressed his letter to the men in the room, but his sentiments applied to the women too! Remember how he appealed to Euodia and Syntyche in his letter to the Philippians (Phil. 4:2-3)? Our brother Paul was mindful of his sisters. We are all one in Christ Jesus (Galatians 3:28).]\n\n“Grace to you…”\n\nIf anyone knows the boundlessness of grace, it was the apostle Paul (1 Timothy 1:15). Grace was the foundation of the Colossians’ faith—and it’s ours too. Paul consistently reminds us in his letters of this incredible truth: When it comes to grace, we can’t have too much, and we will always have enough.\n\n“…and peace from God our Father.”\n\nA prison cell is not the place you’d expect to find peace. Yet, Paul not only displayed peace, he prayed peace for his brothers and sisters. Paul knew the false teaching the Colossians were fighting, and he knew the fight was not easy. But he also knew where true peace comes from (John 14:27). As he begins this letter of bold truth and unabashed gospel teaching, Paul sends “peace from God our Father,” demonstrating his sincere love for his fellow believers.\n\nAs we prepare to read this letter together over the course of the next two weeks, let’s join Paul in pushing back the lies by giving thanks for what is true. Let’s give thanks to God for our fully undeserved, yet fully secure, standing in Christ Jesus, and for our place in this broad, beautiful family of faith. Let’s remember God’s grace, accepting a fresh dose of it anew and resting in the peace that is ours from God our Father.\n\nLet’s ask the Lord to prepare our hearts to hear the good news of the gospel once again. It is the truth that defeats all the lies, the only antidote for our ailing souls. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nMy obsession with lists runs deep. I’ve never understood how some of you can live without them. How do you keep track of all those to-dos? More importantly, how can you resist the satisfaction of making a list just to cross off all the things you’ve already accomplished?! It’s a mystery to me. \n\nLists give me a sense of structure and focus—a bit of clarity in an otherwise confusing and chaotic world. If you ask me, Paul was a list guy too. For starters, he lists all the reasons he and Timothy are thankful for the church in Colossae:\n\nThey had love for God’s people (v. 4).\nThey received the gospel (v. 4-5).\nThe gospel in them was bearing fruit in the world (v. 5).\nThey recognized God’s grace in the truth (v. 6).\n\nTalk about encouraging! Who doesn’t love a list like that?\n\nBut Paul’s list-making tendencies move on to an even more profound purpose: he sets the tone for the rest of his letter to the Colossians by spelling out his specific prayer for them as a church. Look at this brief but powerful list Paul prays for the Colossians in this short passage:\n\nThat they would grow in the knowledge of God (v. 10).\nThat they would endure by Christ’s power (v. 11).\nThat they would have patience by Christ’s strength (v. 11).\nThat they would give thanks to God the Father (v. 12).\n\nWhy does Paul ask these things for his brothers and sisters at Colossae? The answer is in verse 10: “so that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him.”\n\nWorthy. That’s a heavy word. I don’t know about you, but I have a difficult time seeing myself as worthy of lots of things, let alone the God of the universe. The harder I try to earn my worthiness, the more I seem to become aware of my shortcomings. When I rely on my own strength and strive to live worthy of my God, I fall flat on my face. Perhaps you, like me, see this calling from Paul in Colossians 1:10-12 and start looking for ways to check the boxes to worthiness. It’s difficult to turn our focus away from doing all the “right things” when it’s spelled out for us like this. It’s tangible, like our to-do lists, and we like to see our progress and accomplishments as we work through these things.\n\nBut there is only one thing that makes us worthy of the Lord: faith in Jesus. We can’t obey the call to walk worthy without remembering where our worthiness comes from.\n\nGalatians 3:13 promises this: “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law.” We no longer live under the checklist curse, having to follow every letter and check every box in order to please God. As we grow in our love for Him and our understanding of His love for us, our focus gradually shifts from our attempts at making ourselves worthy, to giving thanks for a Savior who has redeemed us and made us worthy.\n\nBefore we close our Bibles today, let’s look at one more list. In Colossians 1:12, Paul reminds us of the incredible blessings we have as followers of Christ:\n\nWe share in Christ’s inheritance.\nWe are rescued from darkness.\nWe are welcomed into Christ’s Kingdom.\nAnd we have received redemption from sin and death!\n\nNow, that is a list we can all get excited about. It is the list that has been fully checked off by Jesus on our behalf, and none of our shortcomings can subtract from it. May we cling to Him today, trusting that we are worthy because of His saving work in us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Debbie Eaton\n\nEvery Tuesday I meet my mentor for a walk in the woods, where a dry dirt path meanders through pine and California oak trees. Wild flowers change with the season and dry shrubbery reminds us of the drought. The path takes us to a picnic bench with a stunning backdrop of the Cleveland National Forest, majestic mountains reaching to the sky. \n\nThere we sit for an hour, in deep conversation about God. Recently our dialogue was directed by this multi-part question: Who do you believe God is? Who or what has influenced that belief? Is that belief true?\n\nIn all honesty, our conversation made me realize how easy it is to be influenced by the world’s view of God. Culture can all too easily distract and misguide us unless we know, really know, who God is by reading His Word and believing its truth (Colossians 2:7).\n\nPaul knew well the need to understand the truth of who Christ is, and he emphasized this vital truth as he evangelized and ministered the good news of redemption to others. At the time of this particular writing Paul was in prison, likely in Rome. A man named Epaphras, who is believed to be the founder and leader of the Colossian church, visited Paul and requested his help in dealing with the false teaching confronting the church. Having never been to Colossae himself, Paul wrote this compelling letter. It includes, in verses 15-20, a hymn thought to have been sung by the very early church—a statement of faith exalting the supremacy of Christ in both creation and redemption.\n\nAccording to God’s Word—and this old hymn of the church as “sung” here by Paul— this is who Christ is:\n\nHe is the image of the invisible God.\nHe is the firstborn over all creation.\nHe is the creator of everything in heaven and on earth.\nHe is before all things.\nHe is the One who holds all things together.\nHe is the head of the church.\nHe is the beginning.\nHe is the One in whom all the fullness of God dwells.\nHe is the reconciler of all things.\nHe is the ultimate peacemaker.\n\nTake a moment to soak in these words today. Go back and read Colossians 1:15-20, and give thanks for a Savior who is indeed all these incredible things. Read these verses silently, shout them aloud, or even sing them with joy! Ask God for fresh eyes to see the divine nature of Christ.\n\nHe is the one who created you and called you, who holds all things together even now, even today. He is the beginning and the end. He is the loving God who took on flesh and made peace with His children through the blood of His cross.\n\nPaul’s hymn of adoration is a reminder for us today that Christ is alive! He is alive and present in our world, in our community, and in us, that we may be rescued, redeemed, and resurrected in new life. Who Christ is does not change, no matter the view from where we sit today. May these beautiful words from Paul’s letter direct our hearts to worship Him.\n\n…yet for us there is one God, the Father.\nAll things are from Him,\nand we exist for Him.\nAnd there is one Lord, Jesus Christ.\nAll things are through Him,\nand we exist through Him. \n-1 Corinthians 8:6\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Vivian Mabuni\n\nSituated right near the bathroom, our side of the dorm floor drew high traffic. The sound of laughter competed with the high whizzing of the blow dryers. Bits of conversation could be overheard each time the door squeaked open. Constant commotion filled the halls, day and night.\n\nThis particular Friday afternoon an abnormal hush permeated the hallways. My roommate, like the rest of the girls on the floor, had left for the weekend. My door was left open out of habit. I paced back and forth inside the room, talking under my breath, and glanced up from my notes when I heard a knock. Kimberly, from down the hall, popped her head in and asked, “Hey! What are you doing?”\n\n“Oh, I’m just practicing for a talk I’m giving tomorrow on training people how to communicate about their relationship with God. Wanna listen and give me some feedback?”\n\nI tried not to look surprised when she nodded and plopped down on my bed. I invited all the girls on my floor to our dorm Bible study every week, but Kimberly never showed interest.\n\nI was just a young college girl, still learning the depth of the gospel, but even then I knew I played a part in a holy calling: “to make God’s message fully known” (Colossians 1:25).\n\nAs I went through the presentation, Kimberly smiled and nodded, playing the part of supportive, interested listener. I finally reached the part explaining two circle diagrams. One circle had Christ on the throne inside the life and self surrendered to Christ. The other had self on the throne and Christ outside the life.\n\n“Which circle best represents your life, Kimberly?” She pointed to the circle with Christ outside.\n\n“Which circle would you like to represent your life?” She pointed to the circle with Christ on the throne.\n\nAt that point I put down my notes. “Kimberly, really, you’ve been so great listening and paying attention and all. You don’t need to pretend about the circles.”\n\nBut Kimberly wasn’t pretending. She wanted to know Christ, and I had the joy of introducing her to Him. We talked for a bit more and then, with tears in both our eyes, we prayed together as she surrendered her life to Jesus and joined God’s family. And the hallways around the dorm floor filled with angels celebrating new life (Luke 15:10)!\n\nLike Paul, our holy calling is to make the gospel known wherever we are, to proclaim Jesus—not empty doctrine, not some moral or ethical code (Colossians 1:28, 1 Corinthians 2:2). Paul’s letter to the Colossian Christians is infused with rich language focused solely on the person and work of Jesus Christ. Note how many times “in Christ” occurs in today’s reading. In Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge (v. 2:3). We are to walk in Him (v. 2:6), be rooted and built up in Him (v. 2:7). The focus and source of life is found in Jesus.\n\nAs believers, new and seasoned alike, we have the privilege of proclaiming Christ to those around us, to help them grow in their understanding of Him. Whether the dorm floor or workplace, neighborhood or soccer field, we are placed there by God to point others to Him (Acts 17:26)! He is our holy calling.\n\nMay we faithfully proclaim Him, so that others might see Christ in us, “the hope of glory” (Colossians 1:27).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Colossians 2:8-15, Matthew 15:1-9, Romans 7:4\n\nHave you ever seen a throw pillow with something like “sticky baseboards and messy laundry means you really love your family” embroidered on it? That kind of talk really burns my buttons. I like to think there is a direct correlation between clean floors and a well-loved family. I feel this so strongly, I have tried to enforce daily cleaning chores. \n\nEVERYONE MUST CLEAN, I declare, and start drilling my six-year-olds on sanitation protocols and urging my four-year-old to truly attend to the crumbs under the chair legs. By the time the house is clean, my oldest is a griefy mess and my long-suffering husband wishes I could have just let well enough alone. I am a ridiculous Faires-Pharisee about the whole thing. (My last name is Faires. Sometimes the pun is a little too close for comfort.)\n\nWhen all is said and done, my house is very clean, doggone it. But my people are all wilted and miserable. In my passion to love my family by working together and making our home clean, I can totally miss the point of loving my family. I get all turned around and fixated on the sticky floors and the messy laundry instead of the people. Clean floors are so awesome, but in getting there, I lose sight of why we clean floors in the first place—for people.\n\nThe folks in Colossae were missing the point too. It’s so easy to do. They were fixated on checking off their boxes on their salvation to-do list. Those guys couldn’t let go of their idea of how salvation ought to be achieved—through the law. So instead of looking up from their busy law-attending to see the true freedom given through Christ, they created more and more rules for themselves.\n\nThe Colossians believed their salvation was incomplete without a little extra action on their part. In effect, they were saying, Christ did a great job and all, sure, but we still need to hustle and bustle to complete the salvation package. But this is not only exhausting, it’s heresy (Galatians 2:16).\n\nPaul said we are complete in Christ. Christ erased the certificate of debt (Colossians 2:14). We can’t erase our own debt, but Christ wiped away everyone’s outstanding balance in one fell stroke. We couldn’t pay our own debt because we were dead in our trespasses.\n\nWe can’t climb out of our own graves by trying really hard—we are dead. Jesus quotes the prophet Isaiah in Matthew 15:8 when he reminds us:\n\n“These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”\n\nWhat simultaneous censure and freedom is found in these words! Don’t worry, Christ has already fulfilled the law for you. So keep your britches on and don’t go out and create your own pseudo rules for salvation.\n\nTherefore, my brothers, you also were put to death in relation to the law through the crucified body of the Messiah, so that you may belong to another—to Him who was raised from the dead—that we may bear fruit for God. –Romans 7:4\n\nGimme that embroidered on a pillow!\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sarah Matheny\n\nText: Colossians 2:16-23, Romans 14:1-23, Hebrews 8:1-6, Hebrews 10:1-10\n\nI’ve heard it takes 21 days to make a new habit stick. In theory, after three weeks of going through the paces, whatever habit you’re trying to adopt will finally stick. The shadow of who you want to be, in 21 days, will have been fully eclipsed by a new, truer you—a sugar quitter, a regular exerciser, or one of those responsible individuals who skips the Netflix binge-watching and goes to bed early. In theory.\n\nThe tricky part—which anyone attempting such goals will tell you—is getting through those 21 days without quitting. Keep in mind, this is coming from the woman who has twice caved during 30-day sugar detoxes to cookie dough ice cream and peanut butter cups (days 8 and 11, respectively).\n\nIn an effort to maintain consistency, we easily-tempted humans utilize all sorts of “self-help” tools of various rules and rituals, not to mention accountability via hashtags online, social media check-ins, wellness apps, and maybe even real live community groups. While these things can be useful in getting us closer to our goal, we also run the risk of making them our sole and supreme focus.\n\nThough Paul certainly isn’t referring to quitting sugar in these words to the Colossians, he is speaking to the danger of being so lost in religion and ritual and how-tos that we never truly taste the goodness of God. He is preaching against asceticism, a severe, man-imposed self-discipline that serves as self-serving checkmarks rather than true submission to God (Colossians 2:22-23).\n\nPaul feared Christians in Colossae were becoming more occupied with these acts of “merit” than with the living Christ Himself.\n\nFriends, don’t we do our own version of these empty acts today? Take my daughter, for example, making “breakfast” in her play kitchen and then gnawing on a plastic waffle. Are we tasting the real thing or just going through the paces? Are we doing spiritual things because they’re “good,” or are we doing them out of love for Christ?\n\nThese “virtuous” disciplines, as Paul writes, are simply a shadow. The substance is Jesus (Colossians 2:7). When we buy into these practices apart from the person of Christ, we undervalue God’s grace, presuming that He needs our righteousness. He doesn’t. Christ is perfectly righteous, and we can only find our fullness in Him. In love, He calls us to live in a way that is good and holy and right—not out of fear of losing our salvation, but out of our adoration of Him.  \n\nA full life in Jesus doesn’t mean 21 days of going through the paces, making a prideful display of spiritual acts we think will make us more holy. We can’t be satisfied with the shadow, not when we have the Savior. The gospel offers real fullness in Christ, freely given. And believe me, friends, nothing tastes sweeter (Psalm 119:103-104).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellie Holcomb\n\nText:  Colossians 3:1-17, John 11:25, Philippians 3:12-16, Romans 6:1-14\n\nTruth? I’m sitting in my bedroom writing this morning, and it looks like a bomb went off in here. I have yet to unpack from three different trips we’ve taken this month, the laundry basket was long ago lost under the mountain of dirty clothes that have piled up, and my desk is littered with mail I haven’t read, invitations I haven’t RSVP’d to, and about 30-50 post-it notes my two- year-old drew on yesterday while she was “working.”\n\nThe state of my bedroom matches the state of my heart. It’s a mess in there. I’m looking at a “to-do” list of things left undone and the mess around me, and all the lies are coming. “You are terrible at life. You’re worthless. You can’t get anything right.” I feel stressed, anxious, overwhelmed, and sleep-deprived, and looking at the state of my heart and my bedroom makes my shoulders tight. I am also grieving some brokenness in the lives of dear friends, and the weight of it all feels like too much this morning.\n\nWhen I’m overwhelmed like this, I revert back to my old friends Shame and Fear, and the company they keep with me is terrible. But then I read this:\n\nSet your minds on what is above, not on what is on the earth. –Colossians 3:2\n\nAnd I’m reminded of something my pastor told us a few years ago: “For every look you take at yourself, take ten looks at Jesus.”\n\nI remember practicing this years ago with our small group. We would sit around and share what life was throwing at us, and for each struggle, we would move our eyes together from the trial to the cross—to the promises God has given and the life He’s called us to live. The practice was and is transformative.\n\nThis morning, as I turn my mind from the mess both around and inside of me to the face of Jesus, something is shifting. I’m remembering His love and how He covers me even when I make a mess of things (Colossians 3:3). I’m remembering that He is a God who is not afraid of our messes but who enters right into the middle of them.\n\nI’m remembering that I am no longer a slave to sin (Romans 6:6), and that He’s called me to something better. I may struggle with the same junk over and over again, but each time I struggle is an opportunity to draw near to Jesus. Each struggle is an opportunity to put off the old self and take hold of that which Jesus has already taken hold of for me (Colossians 3:5-11, Philippians 3:12).\n\nToday I’m sitting here in this room, remembering that you and I have a beautiful invitation to a new life in Christ. As we put off all our sin, we get to put on His love—and His love looks good on everybody (Colossians 3:12-14)! I’m remembering that I get to choose how I think. I can choose to let the “peace of the Messiah” control my heart rather than fear and shame. And I can choose to be thankful, even when life breaks my heart and doesn’t turn out like I wish it would. In light of what Jesus has done for all of us on the cross, there is always a reason for thanksgiving.\n\nMost of all, I’m remembering that I am “dearly loved,” and that changes everything (Colossians 3:12). So sisters, instead of just focusing on ourselves today—on what we’ve done or left undone, on how we ache, or on how we wish things were different than they are— let’s turn our eyes, over and over again, to the One who knows and loves us best.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Alyssa Joy Bethke\n\nText: Colossians 3:18-4:1, Matthew 6:33, Ephesians 5:22-6:9\n\nIt’s been a rough week in the Bethke household.\n\nMy husband has had some extremely long work days, and we’ve hardly seen him. Then he got sick. Then I got sick. And now we’re packing to leave home for a month, baby girl in tow.\n\nI’m overwhelmed. I feel drained and in need of a break. And if I’m completely honest with you, which I’d like to be, today I have had a terrible attitude. The inside of my heart looks a little like this:\n\nBut I’m exhausted too! Can’t I have a nap? Can’t someone make ME soup? I know somebody has to keep the ship sailing, but why does it always have to be meeeee?\n\nTerrible, right?!\n\nBut, do you know what? God knows my heart, even on my terrible days. He knows your heart too. And He knows relationships are messy because, the fact is, we’re messy. And so, through Paul’s letter, the Father gently lays out Colossians 3 for us, telling us what actions to put off and what actions to put on. Then, in Colossians 3:18-4:1, Paul gets into the nitty gritty of certain relationships. Husbands and wives. Parents and children. Masters and slaves. (We get the distinct sense this list of two-party relationships could go on.)\n\nHe sums up these diverse relationships with this:\n\nWhatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ. —Colossians 3:23-24\n\nRelationships can be tough for everyone. We feel forgotten, misunderstood, and underappreciated. We try hard to please and we get caught up in comparisons. We can feel brought down, discouraged, frustrated, angry—we can feel a lot of things.\n\nBut in the quiet, the Lord whispers to us, My child, I know you. And I love you. Do all that you do, FOR ME (Psalm 139:1, Romans 8:38-39, Colossians 3:23).\n\nWhen we take our eye off Jesus, we put them onto ourselves and those around us. But true love, hope, and joy don’t come from ourselves or others—they come from our Savior! We can find joy in difficult moments, relationships, and circumstances because God is the only One we need to please, and we can rest in His unending love and grace. We don’t have to earn His love; He freely is pouring it out on us every moment of every day (Romans 5:5).\n\nMy friend, you are not forgotten. You are seen (Psalm 139:2).\n\nYou are not underappreciated. You are greatly rejoiced over (Zephaniah 3:17).\n\nYou are understood. God made you who you are (Psalm 139:13-14).\n\nThe gospel should be the fuel of all our relationships, in the joyful moments and the tough moments. The messy moments will happen but, like us, they are not beyond Christ’s redemptive reach. When we keep our eyes on Jesus— remembering that He is the one we serve when we love others— the perspective and attitudes of our hearts will be laced with the grace of Christ.\n\nMay we do all things for Him and for Him alone.\n\n“But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you.” -Matthew 6:33\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Colossians 4:2-6, Psalm 145:18-19, Philippians 4:6-7, Matthew 5:16\n\nIf you want to experience heartache and hope in the same breath, read the “Missed Connections” section of Craigslist.\n\nThis regret-ridden virtual message board, similar to a milk carton ad for “missing persons,” contains the pleas of locals who cannot shake the weight of a missed opportunity. They lay awake at night, deciding that if different words (or words at all, for that matter) had been spoken to the girl across the room or the boy at the bus stop, they would be together frolicking in daffodils, tasting wedding cakes, or binge-watching Netflix. (A girl can dream, right?)\n\nA few years ago, I might have been tempted to post my own message to that guy across the crowded room:\n\nTo the boy in my favorite coffee shop who asked if I was a football fan,\nI said no because I was trying to play it cool. I’ve never missed a game.\nAlso, I just found out you happen to be our new quarterback. Let’s get married.\n\nIt’s just so embarrassing to feel misunderstood, isn’t it? But even worse, we can’t leave it alone. Our unquenchable need to be seen and heard curls its fists, marching backward and demanding another chance to be acknowledged. Vowing to only curate attractive qualities and pleasing viewpoints from then on, we rest assured people will treasure our perspectives forever. They don’t.\n\nAnd yet it is our clumsy, shaky voices that are chosen to communicate something so precious: the gospel. This call is so high and so important that I immediately fear it. If my words are jumbled and my speech begins to stutter, can I cause someone to bypass an encounter with Christ?\n\nAs Paul wraps up his letter to the Colossians, he addresses these concerns, advising them to “act wisely toward outsiders, making the most of the time” (Colossians 4:5). He continues, “Your speech should always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should answer each person” (Colossians 4:6).\n\nBefore our insecurities rise again, let’s focus in on the interesting way Paul uses the word “salt” here, because it changes everything. Friends, he’s talking about grace! Our job is simply to allow others to taste the salt of grace. We are side-by-side consumers of God’s provision, sharing plates with those around us.\n\nSalt causes thirst. God’s Word doesn’t need our PR efforts. Its mere mention causes sin to salivate for grace. Our job is not to concoct our own savory presentation of the gospel; every ingredient was chosen to feed our own innate hunger. Instead, our task is to speak words from our personal thirst, pointing to the source of Living Water (John 7:37-39).\n\nSalt is a preservative. Grace goes before and behind us, allowing even our faultiest efforts to proclaim His glory. Because of this, we don’t need to focus on results and reactions, but on the surety of God’s control. We can share generously and graciously from a sound-minded spirit.\n\nGod does not need us to share the good news, but He chooses us as His vessels of grace. As sharers of the gospel, our job description is less about defending our stance and more about gluing our eyes to His posture.\n\nMay the salt of grace season all of our encounters today, and may we be thankful for our God who never misses a connection. Amen. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Colossians 4:7-18, Romans 15:30-33, Philippians 1:3-7\n\nI like to think of the final greetings in Paul’s letters as the “say hello to your mother for me” section. He opens with his typical “grace and peace,” follows with some thanksgiving and prayer, then gets down to business. By the end, he often zeroes in on some very specific housekeeping matters before he closes.\n\nHave you noticed this pattern, too?\n\n \u2022 Grace & peace.\n \u2022 I’m thankful for you. I pray for you.\n \u2022 Do not forsake the true-true-true gospel.\n \u2022 But really, don’t forget what being a Christ follower means and what it doesn’t mean.\n \u2022 Be good to each other.\n \u2022 Say hi to so-and-so for me. (Or, put more accurately: When you bump into these people, listen to what they say and take care of them. Oh, and this person says hello!)\n \u2022 Also, this really is me sending this note. (Paul often dictated his letters, then signed them with his own hand at the end.)\n\nIt’s the housekeeping piece at the end that, though often overlooked, contains some of the most interesting little details of Paul’s letters. He’s naming names. Arranging meetings. Making sure people are looking out for each other. He’s caring for the church as a whole—the body of Christ.\n\nFor fun (and because there is always something to learn!), let’s take a closer look at the people Paul mentions. What is so important about these folks, anyway?\n\nTychicus was a native of Asia Minor who delivered this letter to Colossae, as well as the letter to the church in Ephesus and Paul’s personal letter to Philemon. (Isn’t it so cool that God used Tychicus as a courier for some of the most important mail in Christendom?)\n\nOnesimus may be my personal favorite. He was Philemon’s slave, but when he escaped to Rome he met Paul and then Jesus. (The book of Philemon is a super-quick, super-compelling letter from Paul to Philemon, calling in a big favor: he asks Philemon to take Onesimus back, not as a slave, but as a brother in Christ.)\n\nAristarchus was from Thessalonica. He joined Paul on his journey and gave his life and freedom so that others may know Christ.\n\nMark actually had a bit of a reputation because he bailed on Paul early on, which caused a falling out between Paul and Barnabas (Acts 13:13, 15:39). As Mark matured spiritually, he returned to work alongside Paul, who instructed the church to welcome Mark back.\n\nEpaphras was from Colossae, too. Colossians 4:12 says he “contended” for the Church in his prayers. The Greek word for “contend” here means “to fight for.” (Isn’t it good to remember that one of the best ways we can fight for Christ’s church is by praying for her?)\n\nLuke was, of course, the author of the Gospel that bears his name, as well as the book of Acts. It seems Luke stayed with Paul throughout his imprisonment, aiding in the ministry of the gospel.\n\nDemas has sort of a bummer of a story. He deserted Paul because “he loved this present world” (2 Timothy 4:10). (Man, I hate how painfully close-to-home Demas’ two-second story feels.)\n\nNympha was a Christian woman who had a lot of money and hosted the church in her home. She gave what she had for the gospel.\n\nFinally, Paul charges Archippus (possibly the son of Philemon) to pay attention to the ministry he has received in the Lord, so that he may accomplish it (Colossians 4:17).\n\nYou guys. That is a lot of people. None of them were perfect, yet Paul intentionally and affectionately included them by name in his letter. Among this web of individuals and cities, there was a lot of brokenness, disappointment, and even betrayal.\n\nDoes it help you to see that the church then looked a lot like the church does today? It was full of flawed people who needed to forgive and be forgiven. They forgot the true gospel was for them and for each other. There was real hurt and genuine restoration.\n\nAs we close out this series of letters from Paul to the early church, let’s pay attention to how wildly relevant even his final greetings are to us as the church today.\n\nRestoration among believers is still possible.\nFighting for the church sometimes just means praying for her.\nThe temptation to love this present world isn’t a new one.\nAnd best of all? The truth of the gospel hasn’t budged one bit.\nIt was true for Paul and his friends then. And it is true for you and for me today. \n\nThanks be to God!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Acts 16:1-40, Acts 17:1-34, Acts 18:1-5\n\nMy grandmother had five siblings, and by the time I came along, the six had married to become twelve. I grew up around their vegetable and flower gardens, in their kitchens that smelled of soup beans and cornbread. I listened to them tell stories late into the night, sat by as they played cards amid uproarious laughter, even stood outside in my pajamas after dark as they howled old songs by the light of the moon.\n\nI rarely think of one of them without thinking of all of them. In my mind they were a set—always connected. That’s not to say they were always together over the years. They saw wars and endured moves and raised children in different states. But when life separated them, they built bridges with letters. They wrote letters home from overseas, sent postcards when they traveled, mailed handwritten pages of updates from one address to the other.  Even now that only two of the twelve remain, they write letters to us, their family. They keep us connected still. \n\nLetters encourage in a way email never will. They speak to a part of the soul that social media comments can’t quite reach. When I read the letters from the Apostle Paul to the church at Thessalonica, I hear the earnestness of words written by hand and carried on foot. I hear a weary pastor, a brother in the faith, longing to see his congregation—his family. \n\nToday’s Scripture reading gives us context for our study of the letters of 1 and 2 Thessalonians. Acts 16 and 17 tell how Paul visited Thessalonica on his second missionary journey—a journey that included many other cities and countless trials along the way. The apostle faithfully preached the gospel to anyone in earshot, and they ran him out of nearly every town he dared enter. But Paul’s work was not in vain because the Holy Spirit was at work. Families of faith formed along his route—one of them in Thessalonica.\n\n Paul’s letters to the Thessalonian believers are like so many of his other letters, filled with instruction on how to live the Christian life. But these letters do more than clarify theology; they are filled to the brim with affection and encouragement for the men and women whose belief in and hunger for the gospel encouraged him, their teacher. Paul wrote to build up his Thessalonian faith family, not with empty platitudes, but with a hope rooted one truth: “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah” (Acts 17:3). \n\nAs you walk through 1 and 2 Thessalonians in the coming weeks, read with a heart for the present and an eye to the future. We are here on this earth for a time, connected as sisters and brothers in the faith. But we are only here for a time. The greatest encouragement we have to offer one another is the hope of Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 1:1-10, Romans 8:35-39, 1 Peter 4:12-14\n\n“I would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought, and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.” –G. K. Chesterton\n\nI went to a high school with clean carpets, new lockers, and teachers who cared. Whenever adults mentioned the school and its shiny gymnasium floors, they would say, “We’re so blessed to have this facility.” Our teachers would smile as they paraded us to the library full of new books: “We’re so blessed to have this facility.”\n\nIt became a joke, at least between my sister and me, who were still learning the ropes of gratefulness. We’d lounge on the beautifully upholstered purple furniture, looking at original paintings of eagles hung on the walls while chanting to each other in our best Michigan-mom accents, “We’re so blessed to have this facility.”\n\nSomehow, blessedly, we moved from lying around, idly kicking at our backpacks, to being contributing members of that community, and our hearts moved from mockery to genuine thankfulness for the incredible, undeserved blessings in our lives.\n\nIf we can consider Chesterton’s words that the highest form of thought is thankfulness, then ungrateful mockery is possibly the lowest form of thought. Paul is setting the example for his beloved Thessalonians by weaving his thankfulness throughout this letter to them. And he doesn’t just thank them for doing a great job; he thanks God for all the saving benefits bestowed on them, and celebrates the evidence of the gospel in their lives (1 Thessalonians 1:2-5). His thanks are, above all, to God. \n\nAll good comes from God, so no good can be hoped for by sinners but from God. Paul’s thanks to God are appropriate because God is the author of all that is good—not just all the good that comes to us, but even all the good that is done by us.\n\nI think of myself as a pretty thankful person—maybe you do, too—but I hadn’t thought of it as a duty. Matthew Henry goes so far as to say, “Thanksgiving to God is a great duty, to be performed always or constantly; even when we do not actually give thanks to God by our words, we should have a grateful sense of God’s goodness upon our minds.” We are to set our minds always in the gear of gratefulness.\n\nDo you find yourself in a habit of gratefulness to God, or are you set in mockery? When I consider the percentages of the words that come out of my mouth, I’m definitely teasing or complaining at least as much as I’m blessing and thanking.\n\nIf you also find yourself struck by the mockery and ungratefulness that escapes your lips and hangs around your mind, you’re in good company. But don’t just grit your teeth and try harder. Paul immediately points us to the three cardinal graces: faith, hope, and love. And he doesn’t say, “Try harder, y’all! Get you some more faith, hope, and love!” Instead he names the cause of these graces: our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nAll good comes from Him, and any change in our hearts comes from Him. He is the object and also the instigator of our thankfulness. For the gospel also comes to us not only in words, but in power (1 Thessalonians 1:5).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 2:1-20, 1 Corinthians 9:3-14, Hebrews 4:12\n\nI send more emails every day than I can count, but there’s one that brings me an inordinate amount of joy. It’s not work-related, requires many pop culture references, and has low standards for correct grammar. Any questions as to why it’s my favorite? \n\nYou see, a few years ago, I was sitting at my desk at a new job when an email popped up from a name I recognized, yet hadn’t talked to in quite some time. “LONG LOST FRIEND” was in the subject line, and the unnecessary capitalization has become our own kind of necessary in the hundreds of emails that have been sent and received since. \n\nWhat started out as a lighthearted attempt for two girlfriends to catch up over lunch breaks and between meetings became a regular rhythm in my day, and eventually, the sweetest lifeline. This email chain connected two very different lives: one single and dating, and the other newly married; one in Tennessee and the other in Mississippi. But despite our different seasons of life, both of us needed encouragement, typed-out prayers, and echoes of “me too” in ways we couldn’t before describe. \n\nPaul’s letter to the Thessalonians puts words to why the silly emails between my friend and me aren’t so silly after all: God created our lives to be shared. When the Thessalonians read Paul’s words for the first time, I like to imagine them getting the same silly grin I do when an email pops up from my modern-day pen pal. Paul was their guy! He understood them! Thessalonica was going through their own share of suffering and affliction, but this letter was filled with gospel truths—the motivation they needed to help them endure. \n\nPaul’s letter illustrates that being a family of faith involves knowing and being known. His writing assumes a prior two-way relationship, one that repeats phrases like “for you yourselves know” and “as you know.” Closeness in community is vital for any gospel-centered relationship—in ministry, in suffering, and everything in between. But this closeness is not merely circumstantial or emotional; it is rooted in truth and grown in grace.\n\nOne of the best ways to receive and offer encouragement in community is through God’s Word. Paul knew the importance of communicating the truth about Jesus, mentioning Him by name in every single chapter of 1 Thessalonians. As sisters in Christ, we too ought to permanently carry the gospel of hope on our tongues. \n\nGod gives us pieces of His own love when He gives us friendship with one another. Whether with a faraway friend via email or a coworker over coffee, we get to witness redemption, encourage growth, and partake in God’s goodness when we share with others “not only the gospel of God but also our own lives” (1 Thessalonians 2:8). Thanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Wynter Pitts\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 3:1-13, Matthew 4:1-11, Romans 8:16-21\n\nI enjoy being alone. If I’m honest, I should go ahead and admit that it’s actually one of my favorite things to do. After a busy weekend or a house full of activity, I long for a quiet space, large window, soft blanket, and a cup of hot goodness. This is my happy place, and I could stay there for what seems like forever. I am especially prone to long for my alone time when my outward circumstances weigh heavily on my brain and my heart longs for an escape. \n\n I often joke that I just want to sleep it—whatever “it” may be—off. In my ideal world, when things are not going my way, when suffering comes and danger knocks on my door, I simply want to retreat, disappear, and not return until all is well again. And I’d prefer to do this alone.\n\nThough being alone provides a much-needed space to quiet the noise and refocus my thoughts, something dangerous can happen when I retreat to my happy place in order to avoid the discomforts of my reality.  I create an open space for fear to grow, an inviting environment for lies to build and pain to settle in. It becomes easy to lose sight of truth, and I inevitably pull further and further away from Christ. \n\nI know that it is during these times especially that I need to pray and intentionally focus my attention on God’s Word. But can I be honest? In the midst of suffering, this becomes harder and harder to do alone. \n\nIt is during these exact times that I am grateful for my community—friends who will not sit back and watch me sink, but instead will selflessly show up at my door and sit with me. Sometimes they come carrying a load of their own, and our prayers for each become what we both need in order to stand. Whether I want to admit it or not, it is the presence and prayers of others that help keep me secure.\n\nThere is danger in suffering alone. But Christ knew this about us; therefore, He has called us to care for, love, and support those around us regardless of our own personal discomforts. He uses our pain, our circumstances, and stories to grow us in both love for Him and for His kingdom. Paul said it this way to the Thessalonians: \n\n“So we have been greatly encouraged in the midst of our troubles and suffering, dear brothers and sisters, because you have remained strong in your faith.” –1 Thessalonians 3:7\n\nClearly, Paul does not avoid the topic of suffering. He knows it all too well. However, he also knows that his ability to love, encourage, and pray for the people around him is directly connected to his dependence on Christ. \n\nWhen relying on our personal strength to stand, we will surely fall. However, Christ calls us to trust in Him in all circumstances. It is only the outpouring of His love that strengthens us to stand, and encourage those around us. Thanks be to God who knows us better than we know ourselves, and gave us the gift of community. “And may the Lord cause [us] to increase and overflow with love for one another and for everyone” (1 Thessalonians 3:12).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Live in Holiness",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 4:1-12, Ezekiel 36:26-27, 1 Peter 1:15-23\n\nThe word “holiness” is one of those terms that, depending on your background, can carry a lot of baggage. For some of us, it’s connected to feelings of guilt and shame, an impossible standard hanging over us. Others associate it with harshness and judgment after hearing it taught legalistically.\n\nAt first blush, 1 Thessalonians 4 might seem to play into these stereotypes by linking holiness with sexual morality. Paul exhorts the Thessalonians toward holiness by cautioning them from indulging in “lustful desires” (v. 5), and instead encouraging them to “control their own bodies.” Just another Christian prude, our present-day culture might think. However, there is more going on here than first meets the eye.\n\nFirst is the Thessalonian culture, which is remarkably similar to our own. Many New Testament scholars note that the pagan Thessalonian culture had a liberal view of sexuality. Sex outside the bounds of marriage was not only permissible, but even encouraged.\n\nThe second thing to note about this passage is the tone. It’s tempting to read instructions about holiness in a thundering voice of condemnation, but that was not Paul’s approach. In verse 1, the Greek word erotao—translated “entreat” or “encourage”—has a connotation of gentleness and friendship. Paul isn’t dropping a hammer of judgment; instead, he is clarifying and affirming a community he loves. \n\nPaul can see the Thessalonians are living their faith well. They are honoring Christ with their lifestyles. They are pursuing holiness in every area of their lives. But as they continue to do so, Paul wants them to make a distinction between the teachings of their culture and the teachings of Christ, which diverge on the issue of sexual practice. \n\nThis context matters, especially in light of popular stereotypes about Christian holiness and sex. For Paul, holiness is not a measuring stick we should use to compare and condemn. By its reckoning, we all fall short.\n\nInstead, holiness is our witness. It’s how we point the world to the character of God and proclaim, “This is what God’s love is like.” God’s love is intimate and invested. It is constant and covenantal. It is dignifying rather than degrading. It does not use and abuse. It does not take advantage for a short-lived thrill. It isn’t rooted in selfish desire but self-giving faithfulness. Our holy lives bear witness to all these things.\n\nIn that sense, holiness is not simply about being different or set apart, but reinvigorating the imagination of a world which misunderstands both God and sex. Rather than sneer at our culture and its sexual norms, we can humbly and joyfully point to something better. Our holy lives can serve as the embodiment of God’s best for humanity, a vision of freedom, honor, and dignity.\n\nHoliness was never meant to be a spiritual bludgeon. And it is much more than a set of boundaries and rules. It is our witness to a world that has forgotten how to live. It is our witness to a world that has forgotten what we are for. And it is our witness to a world that has forgotten what God is like.\n\nEverything about us—our bodies, our sex—is a part of that witness. We, the people of God, exist to point people to God. Love is His song, and holiness is the dance.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, 1 Thessalonians 5:1-11, Joel 2:31-32, 1 Corinthians 15:42-49\n\nGod keeps His promises.\n\nIt’s an indisputable fact that no one can keep promises better than God. I will not be persuaded otherwise, and neither should you. After repeatedly attempting to achieve lifelong happiness by setting my hope on the promises of friends, boyfriends, or family members, and then finding myself picking up the pieces of my broken heart after the carpet got yanked out from under me each time, I finally can speak this truth: There ain’t nobody NOWHERE that can keep a promise like God can! \n\nAllow me to elaborate.\n\nIn 1 Thessalonians 4, Paul encourages believers not to grieve hopelessly when fellow Christians die.  Grieving like there is no hope is what the world does, not what Christians do. Paul isn’t trying to be callous here—of course there is room to grieve when a loved one dies. He’s using that example as a way to illuminate a substantial promise from God: Life in this world is only the beginning.\n\nHere’s the thing: the same power (God’s power) that raised Christ from the dead is taking up active residence in every believer. God’s power transforms us from those who were once walking in darkness into children of glorious light. This illuminating power enables us to lead lives of godliness and holiness— teaching, correcting, convicting, guiding, and comforting us. And it is that very same power that gives God’s people strength and peace in their dying hour. \n\nBut God’s power doesn’t stop working there. Today’s reading promises that His power is working even after death, resurrecting believers into life eternal. This is the great hope: when this life has been lived, we get to spend eternity in paradise! Paul urges his audience to build up fellow weary believers with the truth of this promise.\n\nIn today’s decidedly postmodern, secularist world, the idea of spending an eternity in paradise seems pretty far-fetched. We’re taught to trust what we can see and can be proven with tangible evidence. But as citizens of the kingdom of God, we’re instructed to trust One that we can’t see or touch. How do we do that? Well, it takes faith. But not blind faith—informed faith. We need faith that relies on what we already know to be true about God and His promises. Here’s a small pool of evidence:\n\nGod promises Abraham that He would make him a great nation… Check!\nGod promises to deliver the children of Israel from slavery in Egypt… Done!\nGod promises to send a Messiah… Yep!\nGod promises to send the Holy Spirit… Again, check!\n\nEven with just a few examples, it’s plain for us to see that God promises big, but He always delivers. Even if no one else in our world can keep a promise, God can. But listen, don’t keep this good word to yourself!  “Encourage one another with these words” (1 Thessalonians 4:18). Let another sister know that when we’re tossed around by the broken promises of others, or when it seems that we’re just spinning our wheels in this life of faith, we’ve got to remember this promise from God: This life is only the beginning.\n\nAnd you can take that to the bank.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 5:12-28, 2 Chronicles 31:4-10, Ephesians 4:11-16\n\nWhat is God’s will for my life?\n\nOh, the anxious hours I’ve spent with this question on repeat, searching for a spiritual formula to solve life’s riddles. My college years especially were a mishmash of trusting the Lord with newfound abandon yet agonizing over every decision. What am I supposed to study? Am I supposed to go on this mission trip or that one? Should I break up with this boy? Should we get back together?\n\nThe weight of my young world balanced precariously on so many question marks. Sometimes it still does.\n\nThe uncertainties I’ve faced in each phase of life have felt big and I’ve felt small, like life is the sum of a million puzzles, most of them missing a piece (or ten). But as the years pass and draw me closer to the Lord, a surprising truth has become clear: God’s will is not a problem to be solved.\n\nGod’s Word tells me His faithfulness does not depend on my wisdom (Lamentations 3:22-24).\n\nGod’s Word tells me His grace does not depend on my performance (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n\nGod’s Word tells me that no matter what shape my life takes, His steadfastness and goodness trump whatever is going on around me (Psalm 136).\n\nFriends, our circumstances are big, but our God is bigger. And as we learn to trust the bigness of our God and the sureness of His sovereignty, we find that His will is not just a path—it is also a way of walking.\n\nIn his letter to the church at Thessalonica, Paul reduces all our agonizing life questions to a non-formula so simple it makes the perfectionists among us a little crazy:\n\n“Rejoice always\npray constantly\ngive thanks in everything\nfor this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. -1 Thessalonians 5:16-18\n\nNo hoops to jump through. No tests to pass. No situational tidiness required. Only actively resting in our God.\n\nWhy an active resting? Because rejoicing is not a passive pursuit. Thanksgiving is not an emotion. We are to declare God’s goodness in every circumstance. We are to let the world know what He has done and what He is doing. We are to pray to Him, seek Him, give Him thanks with an expectant, joyful heart. This is God’s will for us in Jesus.\n\nThere are heartaches among us today. So many question marks, so much waiting, so many puzzles missing a piece. And with so much confusion surrounding us in this world, Paul tells us to “test all things” with the help of the Holy Spirit, and then to cling to what’s true and “hold on to what is good” (v. 21). And we know this: In everything, our God is good. \n\nGod’s love for you is steadfast, no matter the path you’re walking. His promises hold even when your world is crumbling. It is not up to you to be the god of your circumstances. It is for you to give thanks to the One who is greater than any circumstance you will ever face.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Thessalonians 1:1-12, Isaiah 66:15-16, Romans 8:30\n\nI am more of the abundant grace mindset, that all my sins, infractions, and struggles are covered by the spread of the gospel’s cloak. The idea that I must be made worthy of my calling as a child of God rubs raw against me. I don’t like it, if I’m honest. I know my soul, my sins, the weights that so easily entangle me and my proclivity for veering off the seemingly impossible bullseye of perfection. I will not be found worthy. I will be found wanting. \n\nIt seems I am always looking for loopholes in my Christian life. I am by nature lazy and despise boundaries and constraints unless they’re of my own making. I look for ways out and around and over or under, but rarely through because through is hard—and I don’t like hard. This is why I like the abundant grace theology: I can fail hard all my life, kick against the pleasant boundaries God has set for me, and I’m still in.\n\nThis is what Dietrich Bonhoeffer called cheap grace—dependance on a cosmic cloak with nothing of form beneath it: “Forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline. Communion without confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ.” When I make the gospel simply about grace and not about the specific work of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I have cheapened the work. It becomes another form of godlessness. All about me, my performance, and an automatic pass regardless. \n\nPaul, in 2 Thessalonians, gives me the perfect “gospel catch-22.” I am caught up in a story written before the foundation of time that was written by God and not my own worthiness or sense of it. “To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power” (1:11, emphasis mine). Whose calling? Not mine, His. Whose power? Not mine, His. So whose work is this staying worthy? His work by His hand. I cannot wriggle out of this work even if I tried. I am caught in an endless loop of His calling and His power. Caught. Stayed. All in. \n\nThere are ways we usurp the gospel’s full work in us, by neglecting to acknowledge the One whose work all this is. It is His power to will and work in us, and any power we might have is a mere shadow, a substanceless trick of the light. He compels and pursues us, He guards us and guides us, He protects us and provides for us, He completes the work of salvation by the power of the Spirit, through the work of the Son and under the care of the Father. This work is by and for and with and about Him—not us. Even my wriggling out of the careful and pleasant boundaries He has laid for me point to His calling and His power (Psalm 16:5-6). \n\nWhere are you omitting God from the gospel today? How are you making it simply about grace and your own work? Where are you forgetting the wonderful catch-22 loop you’re bound by and set free within? His calling, His work, and by His power. This grace is not cheap; you were bought with a price (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). But this grace is also entirely free—by the work and hand of God—for you.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Thessalonians 2:1-17, Daniel 11:36-37, Matthew 24:30-31\n\nI’m not sure who began the rumor, but somebody did. Somebody in the church at Thessalonica whispered to somebody else that the Day of the Lord had come, and panic began to spread. \n\nPerhaps this person saw evil happening around him and drew his own conclusions. Perhaps someone misinterpreted Paul’s first letter that described Jesus’ Second Coming to be a warning that the Second Coming was upon her. We don’t know, but from the way Paul addressed the issue, we do know that this rumor caused anxiety. \n\nPaul pleaded with the church,  “We ask you, brothers, not to be easily upset in mind or troubled, either by a spirit or by a message or by a letter as if from us, alleging the Day of the Lord has come. Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way” (2 Thessalonians 2:1-3). \n\nPaul’s strategy to dispel this rumor was to fight it with the truth. Referencing a visit recorded in Acts 17:1-13, he asks: “Don’t you remember that when I was still with you I told you about this?” (2 Thessalonians 2:5). He then details the events they had gone over together in Scripture, the events that would precede the End Times, how Christ would prevail over the evil one, and how all of this would happen under the sovereignty of God’s timing. \n\nIn their state of confusion, Paul used the truth to reassure the church. The truth can do the same for us. What rumors do we fall prey to? What causes us to feel fear or to panic? \n\nIt is not only rumors about the End Times that can upset us. It can be rumors about other aspects of our faith. Rumors about people we know. Rumors about people we don’t know. Rumors are so dangerous because beyond misleading people with falsities, they cause unnecessary fear and anxiety. They cause us to trust the story rather than our God. Or, they cause us to judge others based on what we’ve heard about them, rather than what God says about them.\n\nThough rumors may be impossible to avoid, especially in our social-media-driven culture, they are not impossible to dispute. As Christ followers, we are also truth followers, and as truth followers we should also be truth seekers. The ones who—before buying into the rumor—ask ourselves, as Paul did with the Thessalonians: \n\nWhat is the truth here?\nWhat does Scripture really say about this?\nWhere is the Holy Spirit guiding me on this topic, or this story?\nIn this way, we will not be deceived. \n\nRumors cause shadows of confusion, but the truth exposes lies to the light. Rumors cause fear and panic, but the truth brings freedom and peace. Rather than adding to the rumor mill, may we be the ones who put a stop to it with truth—a truth that says God loves us and has given us eternal encouragement and good hope by grace. Now that is a story we can trust in.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Thessalonians 3:1-18,  2 Corinthians 11:7-9, 1 Peter 5:8-11\n\nI try not to follow ambulances, rubber neck at traffic accidents, or stare when someone drops a whole bag of marbles on the ground. But when something goes terribly wrong, somehow we all want to turn our heads to watch. I think it comes from twin desires to help, but also to gawk.\n\nA few years ago, my then eight-year-old daughter and I walked into the food court of our local mall. There we found ourselves pushed to the front of a crowd that must have been nearing 100 people. They were encircling a lifeless boy on the floor, who looked to be no more than two years old. Together, we stood helpless, looking on while EMTs performed CPR on his little body.\n\nI don’t know a lot about medicine, but I do know you only implement CPR if there is no pulse or breathing. It’s our way of manually keeping a body going. Since that was already being done, there was really nothing left for the other 100 of us to do.\n\nAnd so we all stood still and watched. His mother didn’t cry; she paced, she moaned, she shouted. We felt powerless to help the child or his mother. It was shocking to see so many people standing there, hands at their sides, while the battle between life and death was fought right in front of us.\n\nIt’s awful to face our own powerlessness. I like to really lean my shoulder into a job and then promptly see a result for my effort. But when it comes down to it, when things are really important, I’m like that crowd of people, rendered helpless, left watching and waiting.\n\nIn 2 Thessalonians 3:5, Paul prays, “may the Lord direct your hearts to God’s love and Christ’s endurance.” The whole Christian walk is one of dependance. The air we breathe, the gravity that holds us to the earth, and the ability to wonder at it—it all comes from God’s common grace. We have no endurance apart from the endurance of Christ. \n\nMoments of calamity and tragedy unveil our deep neediness and utter helplessness. They direct us to our only strength and recourse, which is Christ. And it is only by His strength that we will not grow weary in in our faith and in doing good in the name of the gospel (2 Thessalonians 3:13).\n\nWhen we saw the baby and his mother in crisis, I took my little girl by the hand and led her around the corner where we found a quiet spot to pray. But even our prayers are a recognition of our enormous need. Prayer is not about what we do, but about running to the God who can do all things. It is an avenue for God to impart His love and endurance to us. \n\nWhat a tremendous grace this is, to know the God who loves perfectly and to be in relationship with the God who endures endlessly. In the face of our overwhelming sorrows, He directs our hearts back to Him. His is the real strength in our ever-present weakness. \n\nThe God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, establish, strengthen, and support you after you have suffered a little while. To him be dominion forever. Amen. —1 Peter 5:10-11\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessica Lamb\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Timothy 1:1-11, Psalm 119:1-7, Acts 16:1-5\n\nMy maiden name was regularly mistaken for a similarly spelled, but distinctly different, last name. People confused the two enough that my father, brother, and I often answered to the wrong name without much thought. My mother, though, never let the wrong name slide. She’d politely smile and correct every person, sometimes more than once, who added an unnecessary “r” to the pronunciation of our last name. Though it was only part of her name by marriage, she fiercely defended its integrity. \n\nWhat remains fascinating to me about this common mistake is how often people disagreed with her correction, telling her the way they misunderstood our name was, in fact, more accurate. It was as if their opinion of what our last name ought to be was more important than what our name truly is. Persistent as they were, they could not change the truth. \n\nThe fight for preserving what is true is at the heart of today’s reading, and of 1 Timothy as a whole. Paul wrote to Timothy, his coworker and protégé, to encourage him to guard the heritage of the Christian faith—a faith that was being challenged by false teaching and a skewed understanding of what it meant to be a follower of Jesus. \n\nIn Acts 16, we catch a glimpse of how Paul’s mentorship of Timothy began. Timothy left his family to travel with Paul on his second missionary journey, sharing the gospel and establishing the early Church. He became one of Paul’s most trusted disciples and coworkers, ministering alongside Paul as he wrote much of the New Testament. Paul wrote this first letter to Timothy while the young protégé was serving as pastor to the church in Ephesus. \n\nWe see the depth of their relationship in how Paul addresses Timothy. More than just a coworker, Timothy is Paul’s “true son in the faith” (1:2).  That affectionate reference is, in part, a reminder to Timothy that he, and all believers, are part of a spiritual heritage. When we come to faith in Jesus, we become part of the family of God (1 John 3:1-2). In this family, part of our ministry is to guard the lineage of our faith by remembering what it means to be a believer and then passing those truths down to future generations. \n\nThe believers Timothy pastored were distracted by empty speculations and false doctrine. We have to guard against the same—whether in our own hearts, in our own conversations, or in how we teach others about our faith through our words and actions. \n\nGod Himself is the best authority on our faith. His Word isn’t a list of meaningless rules; it is light in the darkness, a lamp that shows us where to place our feet as we live lives faithful and true to the heritage of the gospel. When we keep our focus on growing in affection for God and His Word, we stay true to our pursuit of love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith. \n\nJessica Scoggins (not Scroggins) Lamb consumes books, tea, and street-style tacos with equal ferocity.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Timothy 1:12-20, Acts 8:1-3, Acts 9:1-22\n\nI never wanted to join the circus. And yet, here I am, breathlessly perched on the tightrope of terrified obedience. It’s that narrow road we’re called to walk as followers of Christ. The stakes get higher when our faith in Christ compels us to go and to do, to serve and to minister, knowing we don’t have what it takes to do so on our own. \n\nAs we read Paul’s words in 1 Timothy, we can squint our eyes and see him walking on the tightrope ahead of us. As he describes his qualifications for ministry, it’s clear Paul knows how unqualified he truly is. \n\nIt was Paul, after all, who approved the persecution of Stephen. That event was the spark that ignited a raging fire of persecution among God’s people. While the Church wept and wailed, “Saul… was ravaging the church. He would enter house after house, drag off men and women, and put them in prison” (Acts 8:3). \n\nPut that on your Bible college application.  \n\nBased on Saul’s resume, there’s not a single one of us who would pick him to teach the gospel, encourage the saints, plant churches, spearhead missionary journeys, and appoint church leaders. And yet, God Himself described Saul (a.k.a. Paul) as His “chosen instrument” (Acts 9:15). \n\nThis is the seemingly upside down way of our sovereign God. He never calls us into kingdom work because we are the most fit, the most prepared, the most gifted, or the most popular. He doesn’t ask us to do things that we could easily do in our own strength and power. \n\nInstead, He invites us out onto that tightrope where we know we aren’t qualified, where we must trust His Spirit for every step. A life of ministry and obedience can feel scary because we know we cannot grit our teeth and do what is required on our own. We aren’t capable of reaching a lost and dying world or serving selflessly in our own strength. We can’t generate enough elbow grease to produce faithfulness on our own. Our resumés are just good kindling in God’s economy. \n\nThat reality can paralyze us. And yet, when human eyes only saw Saul’s failures, God looked at him and saw future faithfulness:\n\n“I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord who has strengthened me, because he considered me faithful, appointing me to the ministry” (1 Timothy 1:12). \n\nWhile we tend to evaluate our qualifications based on what we see in the rearview mirror, only God is able to see our forward faithfulness. In His sovereignty, He knew that Saul was too weak and sinful to surrender and serve, but He also saw the coming tsunami of grace that would sweep Saul away from his rebellion. \n\nThe next time you look at the ways God calls you to live, love, and serve, thinking “I can’t do this,” know that you’re right. We can’t walk the narrow road on our own. May the gospel steady our feet as with eyes on Jesus we dare to take the next step toward future faithfulness.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Timothy 2:1-15, Deuteronomy 6:4, John 10:14-18, 2 Peter 3:14-16\n\nJust as we’ve all been doing for the past few millennia, I skipped ahead this morning. I glanced at 1 Timothy 2 and read the last few verses and my stomach sunk. This chapter has been hotly debated by theologians far more versed than I in the original languages, in historical context, and in all kinds of study. How can I possibly add to the conversation? \n\nTo write about 1 Timothy 2 for a community of women who will all have some sort of pain or story or lens through which they read this chapter feels too daunting for me. But then my eyes catch the last words of it: “continue in faith, love, and holiness, with good sense” (v. 15). What does it mean, first, for me to honor and obey these words before I think of communicating them to others? Chiefly it means to exercise self-control and read from the beginning. My eyes moved back up the page to these words: \n\n“First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone, for kings and all those who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. This is good, and it pleases God our Savior, who wants everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth” (vv. 1-4).\n\n“First of all, then… ” \n\nThere is an order to these words. Paul wants to communicate something to Timothy: that all people in all places need “petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings” made on their behalf, and in doing so it leads to a “tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity” (v. 1). It gives dignity to all people everywhere when we pray for them, thank God for them, and intercede on their behalf. \n\nIt seems to me the enemy’s best ploy is to steal our dignity, our quietness, and our peace by disordering our reading. Enticing us to lack self-control and skip passages, cherry-picking the most difficult or most beautiful to meet whatever need we have in ourselves or see in culture. But to live quietly, peacefully, and with dignity, we must read in order and, in some ways, do in order. \n\nBefore we argue about hotly debated subjects, do we first dignify one another by praying, interceding, and giving thanks for each other? Are we first people of peace by offering supplication (the action of asking or begging for something earnestly or humbly) on behalf of their personhood, character, story, theology, and personality? Are we primarily people of quietness, trusting that it is God who changes hearts and minds and stories—not us? \n\nThere is so much division in our world today. One needs only a cursory glance at the news to know brokenness abounds. But it’s not just in culture; it’s in the Church, too—this passage is a prime example of passages that divide instead of unite. How, then, can we be people who first pray before debate, who first intercede before we interject, and who first give thanks before we theologize? \n\nThis morning, as I write, I want to stay in the first few verses of 1 Timothy chapter 2 before I move further down in the passage. I want to learn to pray with this kind of open-handedness to the God of the universe on behalf of all people everywhere. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Timothy 3:1-16, Romans 9:15-24\n\nThe hymn “In Christ Alone” has been my church’s unofficial anthem for several years now. I say “anthem” because whenever the worship leader begins to play the familiar chords, the energy in the room changes. Everyone’s attention seems to become more focused, both forward and upward. People stand without prompting, and by the end of the song, we’re all sort of yell-singing our favorite line: “Up from the grave He rose again!” We are declaring in this anthem what we believe. We’re reminding each other of what’s true, and the power of this is tangible in the room.\n\nPerhaps this is why Paul slipped a hymn into his instructions for Timothy. “The mystery of godliness is great,” he says in 1 Timothy 3:16. He then explains what that mystery is by using lines from what some scholars believe was a popular hymn of his time.\n\n“He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory” (v. 16).\n\nThey are the basic tenets of Christianity—truths Timothy knew well. Paul understood our human tendency to forget the truth and simply begin to follow a religion or set of rules for the sake of following something. Using the power of an anthem—his “In Christ Alone,” shall we say—Paul reminds Timothy of the gospel before diving into further spiritual instruction. We need the same thing. \n\nThere’s a method to our godliness, and it’s crucial to understand the reason behind what we do and Who we live for if we’re going to stand strong in our faith.\n\nIn almost the same breath that he declares the mystery of godliness, Paul also delivers a warning to Timothy, saying that in later times there will be false teachers, deceitful spirits, and many who depart from the faith (1 Timothy 4:1-2).\n\nPaul was right. Heresy, deceit, and hypocrisy are not only things of the future; they are rampant in our world now. Knowing, understanding, and believing the mystery of godliness—the gospel of Jesus Christ—is more crucial than ever. Without God’s truth as our anchor, we will float from here to there with each person who enters our lives touting a new philosophy or theology (James 1:6). But with our anthem close to our hearts, we remember who Jesus is and we can distinguish His truth from the lies.\n\nJust as Paul did in his letter to Timothy, we must remember and remind one another of what is true. We declare our anthem to one another again and again, “giving thanks always for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Ephesians 5:19-20).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Timothy 4:1-16, Ecclesiastes 9:7-9, Colossians 2:16-23\n\nFlossing is the elephant in the room when it comes to dental hygiene. It’s right there, we all know we should be attending to it, but few of us are hitting the bullseye.\n\nWhen I first draw out the fresh clean length of floss, all’s fair. As the glistening rope is shimmied between rows of teeth, its usefulness preserves its privilege to be allowed access to my mouth. But the second the act of flossing is over, the string of floss immediately shifts from valued instrument to absolute and unequivocal garbage. Once I’ve finished flossing and set the floss down for even a second, there is no circumstance that could persuade me to take that floss up again and begin the process afresh. Something in my brain tells me that once the floss has left my hands, it’s no longer something useful—now it’s appalling and gross.\n\nArbitrary rules like this usually stem from an important kernel of truth, ranging from harmless to helpful, and even downright quirky. Some people won’t let one food touch another. Others mandate that the proper orientation of toilet paper is out instead of in. But we stray into dangerous territory when we position our cute, quirky opinions as moral law. Paul is writing to Timothy about this precise problem.\n\nFolks at the church in Ephesus had gotten carried away with their opinions, and instead of sticking to the simple truth of Scripture, they added their own rules and declared these as essentials of the Christian faith. Rather than commending them for adding more strictness to the law, Paul condemns these extra rules, reminding them that creation is good. These additions are actually a departure from the faith. Legalism is a natural bent of the human heart. We adore making up our own rules and setting up our opinions as law. Our inclination toward rulemaking is as strong in matters of faith as it is in dental hygiene. But we are not called to simply follow rules; we are called to pursue the living Christ.\n\nPaul encourages us to train ourselves in godliness. God gave us the law to train our sinful hearts. In Paul’s letter to the Galatians, he calls the law our tutor: “Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith” (Galatians 3:24). We need training wheels to point our hearts in the right direction. We need guidance to orient our lives in the ways of grace. God laid out tracks for us to follow, and as we learn to wobble in His ways, we start to think like Him—start to act more like Him. We find we are no longer focused on the rules, but running after the Father with all our might.\n\nThe leaders of Ephesus were getting it all backwards; they were focused on things with limited benefit. But Christ invites us to Himself, for He is beneficial in every way (1 Timothy 4:8). They couldn’t see the forest for trees—or anything important because they were fighting over whether or not they should eat ham. We can’t lead others to Christ when we aren’t seeking Him ourselves. \n\n Look to Christ. Run to Him. “For this reason we labor and strive, because we have put our hope in the living God” (v. 10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Timothy 5:1-6:2a, Matthew 18:15-20, 1 Corinthians 7:39-40\n\nIt was my first time driving in a funeral processional. I’d always been a passenger, not the driver. But on this day I was in the car alone, hazard lights flashing, trusting the cars in front of me to lead me safely to the funeral home. A couple dozen cars drove along, speeding up and slowing down in unnatural rhythm, trying our best to keep too much space from forming between each car in the line. A police officer in a black sedan with flashing lights would block an intersection until some of us passed, and then he’d speed up, siren blazing, to beat the lead car to the next intersection.\n\nThe last stretch of the drive took us down a busy four-lane highway where we came to a stop, assumedly due to afternoon Nashville traffic. But the cause of the delay soon showed itself: two long lines of cars had parted, moving to either side of the road and stopping in silent, reverent lines, waiting for us to pass. I felt like an Israelite driving through the Red Sea on dry ground, passageway granted by a supernatural turn of events. Maybe that sounds melodramatic, but in a world where we daily insist on our own truth and our own way, the gesture struck me as an unlikely bastion of decency in an individualistic society. The last shall be first. Those who mourn shall be comforted. It was the gospel in everyday clothes.\n\nIn our reading today, Timothy, a young pastor of a young church, was learning to lead his congregation in caring for one another. Paul, an older, more experienced brother in the faith, was writing to bolster Timothy’s faith and offer some practical advice. The headline of this particular part of his letter? Support and honor. \n\nThese are actions most of us agree to in theory. Support those in need; honor one another as fellow image-bearers of God. Those who do not know Jesus recognize these concepts too, even if they call them by a different name. It’s the reason the line of cars didn’t plow over the police officer that day and insist on their right to the road: we recognize there is a “right” thing to do. The problem comes in moving from theory to practice; we might agree that supporting those in need is good and important, but exactly who is “in need” and how to support them—there’s the rub. \n\nThe first two verses of today’s reading set the crucial premise for the detailed, context-specific instructions Paul gave Timothy on the subject: “Don’t rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers, older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters with all purity” (1 Timothy 5:1-2). Fathers, brothers, mothers, sisters. In other words, regard your fellow church members as family and act toward them accordingly. \n\nThe Church—the family of God—is to care for one another in love and sincerity. We are to move past good intentions and into action, even though it means risking tension, disagreement, and misunderstanding. If we are indeed family, then we can work it out together, forgiving our imperfections and ignorance along the way, gently helping one another grow in the ways of truth and love as imitators of Christ. And if we are followers of Christ and co-laborers in His gospel, then His reputation, not ours, is what is ultimately at stake. \n\nAs a family who knows the life-changing, life-giving grace of Jesus, may the countercultural support and honor we show one another cause the world to stop and wonder: Who taught them to love like this?   \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Timothy 6:2-21, Psalm 90:1-17, Matthew 27:11-14\n\nI have the gift of always ordering the right thing off the menu. Most of the time, I just look at my husband and ask, “Do you just want me to order for us?” (In truth, it’s more of a statement, than a question.) And 99% of the time, I end up with the best dish. \n\nBut that other 1% of the time, I end up disappointed and usually blame what I consider to be an erroneous menu description, perhaps one that highlighted the wrong ingredient. Or maybe I’d assumed that something would be roasted and instead is raw—that sort of thing. \n\nWhen reality doesn’t measure up to our expectations (whether it’s a movie we’ve been wanting to see, a meal at a fancy restaurant, or a blossoming relationship), it can be devastating. Paul is warning the church at Ephesus about this very thing: false teaching leads to bad fruit. And he is calling on Timothy to guard the truth, the legacy of the faith.\n\nPaul chides those who claim to speak the gospel but believe that “godliness is a way to material gain” (1 Timothy 6:5). He lists signposts of their wayward focus: envy, quarreling, slander, evil suspicions, constant disagreement. He warns Timothy, but then he takes it a step further.\n\nPaul’s warning is not passive. This passage is full of strong action words that charge Timothy and his congregation with the weighty responsibility of representing the faith. John MacArthur wrote that this passage outlines what a man of God should be known for—“by what he flees from, follows after, fights for, and is faithful to.” \n\nAnd what is the north star for this calling, for our calling as Christians? What is the standard to which we should evaluate the things, people, and ideas we flee from, follow, fight for, and are faithful to? What tells us what we should guard? Scripture, that’s what. \n\nWhen Paul uses the word “guard” in verse 20, he uses the Greek word phylassō, which appears approximately 30 times throughout the Bible. Jesus used it when He said, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it” (Luke 11:28).\n\nWe represent the Word of God. We image God Himself. We are mirrors, reflecting the beauty of Christ out into the world. And Paul dares us to do so with integrity to the faith as written in the Holy Word.  \n\nIn a sermon on this passage, Ligon Duncan said: \n\n“Paul calls on Timothy and his congregation, and us, to retain the truth, to hold fast to it; to refrain from dabbling in worldly speculation and false teaching; to realize that false teaching will lead sheep over the edge into destruction; and to be utterly dependent, as we hold fast to that truth, on the only thing that can hold us up, which is the grace of God.”\n\nThanks be to God that we have such a steadfast anchor in the person of Christ and in the Word. And in a world marked by postmodernism, swaying between “your truth” and “my truth” and, so often, no truth at all, I pray that we will lean on the Father’s grace as we guard the heritage of our faith.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Timothy 1:1-18, 2 Corinthians 3:4-6, 1 Thessalonians 5:16-22\n\nThe exact details of the story have faded in my memory. I’m not sure where I heard it or the name of the man at the center of the narrative. I don’t need to know his name to want to be just like him. \n\nHis story goes something like this… \n\nChristians were gathered in a home church in a country where worshiping Jesus was strictly forbidden. Authorities raided the home, forcing the terrified worshipers to lie on the floor, then brutally beat anyone who dared to resist. Despite this violence, they could not stop the man; he was determined to rise. \n\nOver and over, he simply stood up silently, squared his shoulders, and looked his attackers in the eye. He was beaten back down each time only to rise to his feet again. He did not fight. He did not argue. He simply stood, no matter how bloody and bruised he became. Eventually, his attackers relented. Like Paul’s words to Timothy—penned despite imprisonments, beatings, abandonments, and trials—this man’s faith could not be shaken. He would not be kept down. \n\nI may never face the butt of a gun as a result of my faith in Jesus. I may never know Paul’s fate of repeated imprisonment for declaring the gospel. The stakes may not look as dramatic, but we all know how it feels to be beaten down in some way or another. We feel the pressure to play it safe and be quiet about Jesus. But we cannot. Over and over and over, we must continue to rise. We must.\n\nPaul’s powerful words echo throughout time, to the Church in every era. Whatever obstacles we face in culture or in the parthenon of public opinion, whatever makes our knees buckle, whatever threatens to silence us, or makes us want to simply lay low—when we weigh them against the heavy weight of the gospel, the scales are easily tipped. \n\nWe must speak out.\nWe must live boldly.\nWe must rise.\n\nFear cannot become our default. Let us remind each other often that we are a people uniquely armed with power and love and self-control (2 Timothy 1:7). Through the silent testimony of our sold-out lives and words seasoned with grace, we must declare, “But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me” (v. 12). \n\nWhat inspired Paul to declare the gospel so boldly? He refused to forget the stench of the prison of sin he had been delivered from. Every other cell smelled like freedom. He remembered how it felt to be buried by the weight of his own sin, but through Jesus, he had been invited to rise and walk a new life. \n\nPaul’s declaration to Timothy, and our declaration to each other is this: I am not ashamed of the gospel, because the gospel is not ashamed of me. Church, we do not deserve such extravagant grace. We are a ragamuffin bunch called to reach the world with radical truth. \n\nThere will always be opposition. Even so, let us rise. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Timothy 2:1-13, Romans 6:5-10, 1 Corinthians 15:3-8\n\nTwo weeks into my first year teaching history at a private school in Nashville, the Latin teacher stopped at my door. He was tall and round about the middle, with short hair, deep eyes and a soft-spoken voice that carried kindness on every syllable. His oldest daughter was in my class, and when he asked if I wanted to share lunch at the picnic tables, I hesitated. Life had taught me to suspect older men, to assume their intentions were nefarious. But Ben Ellis just wanted to share turkey sandwiches and talk about history. Trying my hand at trust, I said yes.\n\nOver the next year, Ben made a habit of stopping at my door, checking in, dropping off history resources and pep talks in equal measure. His wife and five children became regulars at our dinner table; my husband and I at theirs. Ben was one of the first people to encourage me in my writing, buying a copy of the crappy short story I wrote about birds and pretending not to notice the typos. \n\nAnd then everything changed. Esophageal cancer invaded his body. Soon, he was no longer round about the middle. Soon, he was no longer teaching. \n\nDuring his months of treatment—even up until the last days on earth—Ben enjoyed singing hymns, in particular a call-and-response song that goes like this: \n\n I am bound, (I am bound)\nI am bound, (I am bound)\nI am bound for the Promised Land.\n\nIt was true of him, and it is no less true of me. We are bound for another place. But it’s important to remember that the word “bound” has many different meanings.\n\nOf course, “bound” can mean you are headed somewhere, and we are headed for eternity with God. Jesus promises that He is preparing a place for us, so that we can be with Him forever in that place. We can be confident in that promise because Jesus’ resurrection was not a fairy-tale. It was a historical event verified by more than 500 witnesses (1 Corinthians 15:6). Because Jesus destroyed death, death no longer determines our final destination.\n\nBound can also mean shackled, as in, bound in chains. On earth, we are certainly entangled with suffering. Paul tells Timothy not to shy away from that truth. He reminds Timothy that our temporary struggle is like that of a soldier, an athlete, or a farmer—people who sacrifice willingly, trusting that their efforts will reap a later reward. But as Christians, our reward is not a prize or a harvest. Our reward is not a change in our circumstances, or the healing of our cancers. Our reward is the person of Jesus Christ. We are bound, yes, but we are bound for something. We are bound for Him. \n\nPaul was bound for the Promised Land too. He was literally shackled—his only connection to the outside world, his pen. And he proclaimed the gospel loudly, disregarding that his message almost certainly would lead to his execution.\n\nBut in all the ways we are bound, God is not bound. While we are moving toward heaven, He is unhindered by time and space. While we are limited by our lack of resources, depleted energy, and grief at the suffering all around us, He does not grow weary. His Word is at work in the world—everywhere, always. And that is great news.\n\nAs I consider the limitations on my life, the suffering I wish was over, I cling to God’s promise. Though I am weak, He is strong. Though I am bound, He is already here.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Timothy 2:14-26, Galatians 5:22-25, 1 Peter 3:14-16\n\nWords have the power to heal or destroy. “Sharper than a knife,” we say. When a simple turn of phrase has cut you, you know what I’m talking about.\n\nI’m not prone to physical violence. If anything, I avoid it at all costs. But if I’m truthful, which is the whole point here, I can’t begin to count the times I’ve wounded another with careless syllables, intentionally and unintentionally. I imagine I’m not alone in this.\n\nWhen Paul urges Timothy in his second letter to warn believers to “avoid irreverent and empty speech” (2 Timothy 2:16) he is talking about more than petty gossip. This letter, written shortly before Paul’s death, focuses on the importance of teaching God’s inspired Word correctly. If all words hold incredible life-giving and death-bringing power, imagine how the divine Word of God can alter a life. Sadly, Christians have been known to twist and abuse the Word of God far too often. This was a problem Paul addressed around AD 67, and it’s a problem that still plagues our communities today.\n\nI’m sure we can all call to mind a person in our day and age we might consider a heretic or false teacher. While it’s natural to want to defend the faith, and guard the hearts and minds of others, Paul’s teaching directs us to check our own mouths first. \n\nPaul cautions Christians not to fight about words or get caught up in quarrels over small matters of interpretation. Now, I’ve known many people who enjoy arguing about theology. While there can be productive debate among believers and instances when we must call out false teachings, often these squabbles turn into a hypocritical and discouraging witness. \n\nThe trouble comes when we start preaching about things we don’t understand, or building walls around beliefs that Christ never promoted. Traveling down that road, we can become a hindrance to the faith of others. As Paul put it, you can actually lead to the “ruin of those who listen” (v. 14). Yikes! Now that is something I definitely don’t want to be guilty of! \n\nAs women in the Word, God will hold us accountable for our stewardship of this precious gift of faith. It’s a great responsibility to wield the most potent Word in all of humankind; as the Gospel of Luke says, “From everyone who has been given much, much will be required” (12:48). \n\nWhen we stand before our Lord, we will want to stand “as one approved, a worker who doesn’t need to be ashamed, correctly teaching the word of truth” (2 Timothy 2:15). In order to do that, we must be careful how we speak about holy things. We need not be afraid to share our faith, but we should do so “with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience” (1 Peter 3:16).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Timothy 3:1-17, Exodus 7:8-13, John 15:18-21\n\nTrials are the anvil on which our faith is formed, and yet it is within those trials that we need more faith. Often times, the thing we need most desperately in the midst of trial is the thing still yet unformed in some ways. How, then, is the Christian to prepare for difficulties? How do we prepare for the moments when “evil people and imposters go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived” (2 Timothy 3:13)? I know in those moments I’m most desperate for the lifeboat of a proven faith and not a thing that feels feeble, unfinished, or in process. I want bedrock and my faith feels like it rests on sinking sand. \n\nPaul tells Timothy that the answer for how to “continue in what you have learned and firmly believed”—even though it is still being formed—is in “knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus” (vv. 14-15).\n\nThe answer to a robust faith in the midst of trials is meditation upon Scripture, shoring up our belief, our faith, and our certainty that God is both good Himself and doing good in all our situations. These words of life are able to make us “wise for salvation, through faith in Christ Jesus” (v. 15). This is an astounding promise and a perfect guarantee. Scripture never returns to us void. It always produces the fruit of righteousness: wisdom through faith in Jesus. Not wisdom in our own ability to get through trials or wisdom in proven methods of success. Wisdom through faith in Jesus. \n\nWhen we believe Jesus is who He says He is and will do what He says He will do, our faith is bolstered and we are reminded of the hope within us. Apart from Christ Jesus, we can continue in nothing. Apart from faith centered in Him, we can continue in nothing. Apart from wisdom through faith in Him, we can continue in nothing. Apart from Scriptures from which wisdom is gained through faith in Him, we can continue in nothing. And so, in a beautiful full circle, apart from God giving us Scriptures from which wisdom is gained through faith in Him, we can continue in nothing. Everything begins and ends with Jesus, sweet Jesus. \n\nHow do we continue in what we have learned and firmly believe? Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Every day in every way. If trials are the anvil on which our faith is formed, Christ is the hammer and the fire and the blacksmith, and the finished thing is more perfect and beautiful for it all.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Timothy 4:1-22, Deuteronomy 31:6-8, 1 Corinthians 9:24-27\n\nI’ve run exactly one marathon—actually, a half marathon. It was the winter of 2012, a mild winter, and most mornings, I could survive my five-mile training run with no more than leggings, a long-sleeved shirt, and a hat to keep the wind off my ears. The online guide I’d printed out for first-timers alternated short runs with longer ones, and as I checked the calendar, I realized I was about to hit a new milestone: six miles. I’d never run that far in my life. Every time I passed the five-mile marker, I started walking. That was enough right? Why go further?\n\nMy mind told my limbs that it was too hard, too boring. And so I stopped. Nashville has a renowned running club, which offered half-marathon training, and I knew if I had any chance at hitting my goal, I needed help.\n\nThe following Sunday morning, I showed up to the running club, amazed that there were so many, like me, who needed the help of others. A short Indian man led my pace pack, and when I fell out (at mile five, again) he fell back with me, using his watch to push me to run for a minute, walk for a minute, until my body overpowered my mind. Within a few weeks, I was running seven miles, then ten. And though I was slow, I persisted. \n\nRunning is such an easy metaphor because it is so applicable to our life as Christians. Living a life of self-control and faith can leave us asking, “Why?” What’s the point of waiting until marriage, when there’s so much romance and sex to be had now? What’s the point of trusting in God, when things aren’t going the way you’d planned anyway? What’s the point of staying married, when the days blend together, one never-ending drone of laundry to wash, messes to clean, and cooking to complete? The mundane rhythms of a faithful life are like the pain of a solitary run—one foot after another, breathing, willing yourself not to stop, or to be diverted to another path. It’s not easy, and most of the time, it’s not fun. But it is worth it. \n\nPaul tells Timothy not to grow discouraged in his particular race. Persist, he says, whether it is convenient or not. In fact, I’d venture to say that persistence is most evident when it’s not convenient. When life gets boring and painful, like a long and solitary run, we are so quick to turn for relief, for permission to stop, for a detour. We itch to hear some new truth that indulges our desire for comfort. But our comfort isn’t in the race ending; our comfort comes in the form of great partners, running at our side. \n\nFor a while, Timothy had Paul by his side, like my friend in the running club, offering advice, encouraging him onward. But Paul knew his race was nearly finished. As death lingers in the near future, Paul tells Timothy that he will have to go on alone. But even alone, we are not alone. Paul tells him, “Everyone deserted me, but the Lord stood with me” (2 Timothy 4:16).\n\nI do not know what particular race this day holds for you. This month. This year. Perhaps you are staring at the uphill climb of divorce, a valley of infertility, or the flat plains of our mundane world. Run, my friend. Run slow, if you have to. Enjoy your Christian running mates, if and when they are there. And when they are gone, run, knowing that Jesus is by your side.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Titus 1:1-16, Ephesians 4:11-13, Hebrews 6:13-20 \n\nHave you ever worked under poor leadership? Sadly, most of us have had a run-in with a bad boss or two. If you have ever worked for someone you couldn’t trust, respect, or follow, you know how frustrating and even hurtful those experiences can be. \n\nThankfully, I have had the experience of working under good leadership more often than not. When you operate under people you trust, respect, and want to follow, it positively impacts your entire life—not just at work, but at home too. It’s easy to spot models of healthy and unhealthy leadership in the workplace, and of course the same can be said for our churches.    \n\nThe Apostle Paul took Christian leadership seriously because he understood the impact of an authoritative voice. In his letter to Titus, Paul begins with a declaration of his identity, calling himself “a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ” (Titus 1:1). He also lays out his mission statement: to build up the church in the truth so their lives would change and they would receive God’s promised eternal life (vv. 1-3). With Paul as a model of faithful leadership in the early Church, we see that a godly leader finds their identity and purpose in the Lord. \n\nWhile Paul starts the letter with the state of his own heart, he continues by addressing the requirements for elders, saying in short: it matters how you live your life. He warns against corrupt leaders who are “full of empty talk and deception” because he knows the damage those people wreak (v. 10). Instead, Paul calls for an elder to be “not arrogant, not hot-tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a bully, not greedy for money, but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled, holding to the faithful message as taught” (vv. 7-8). To use a well-worn but apt cliche, a godly leader is not just someone who can “talk the talk,” but a person who “walks the walk.” Better still, a godly leader is one who walks toward Jesus.\n\nWhose lead are we following today? And where are we leading those who follow us? This is not a call to ignore our bosses or disregard those in leadership over us, but rather to be conscious of who is shaping us on a soul level. Are we following those whose identity and purpose are found in the Lord, who live godly lives? \n\nPaul’s letter to Titus gives a good template for what godly leadership looks like, but ultimately, our only perfect leader is Jesus—Jesus, who came in the fullness of God, yet took on the form of a baby and served the broken people of this world to the point of death on a cross. Jesus is the only leader who understands our every feeling and can wipe away our every sin. He is a better guide than any worldly influencer and the only one worthy of surrendering your life to. If you’re looking for a leader who will never fail you, look no further than the feet of Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Titus 2:1-15, Malachi 3:17-18, 1 John 3:2-3\n\nWhen my husband and I went to graduate school, we found a darling old home to rent on a popular street in St. Louis. It had antique door knobs, stained glass windows, and an old-fashioned brass post box that the mailman would slip our mail through each day. I swooned when we moved in, enchanted by all the architectural elements and the original hardwoods and the stunning, old stone fireplace. \n\nI loved that house, until I didn’t. Until we found a mouse, until the emerald green tile in the shower collapsed on my visiting brother-in-law, until our gas bill was more than $400 in the wintertime, the foundation literally started crumbling into the basement, and the water that ran from the taps turned brown inexplicably and then stayed that way. The house was beautiful and charming, but it wasn’t sound. \n\nWhen Paul writes to Titus, the church in Crete was experiencing a similar sort of story. Many people were teaching a Christianity that looked appealing, but was antithetical to the gospel. Titus 1 explains this in detail as Paul tells Titus that the false teachers are “ruining entire households” (v. 11). Theirs was an unsound gospel, and Paul knew the church in Crete was not safe on such a weak foundation.\n\nIn Titus 2, Paul exhorts each member of the household to carry their own weight toward sound teaching. Everyone had a task: older men and older women, young women and young men, slaves and their masters. From “teach what is good” to “be sound beyond reproach,” Paul’s instructions were serious, so that “God’s word would not be slandered” (vv. 1–9). \n\nPaul probably could have stopped there. He was respected by Titus, who would take his words to heart. Paul could trust Titus to put the gospel first. But Paul continues on. In Titus 2:11–14, he recounts the glorious gift of the gospel. Paul’s ballast is Scripture; he is stabilized by grace. Paul is hardly one to say “just do this,” but instead illustrates why someone ought to. He writes:\n\n“For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, instructing us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly way in the present age, while we wait for the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ” (vv. 11–13).\n\nI can’t help but think of my toddler, who adores Laura Numeroff’s picture book, If You Give A Mouse a Cookie. The rest of that sentence is, “he’ll ask for a glass of milk.” The theme goes on and on, a series of if-thens that build throughout the book. \n\nPaul’s closing statements in chapter 2 are a cosmically important “if-then,” telling Christians how to act: If Jesus really brought salvation, then you have to deny worldly lusts and live in a godly way. \n\nThe false teachers in Crete were not living out a gospel that matched the work of Christ. Sound theology mattered to Paul; integrity to the gospel should matter to all of us. May we continue to rely on the unfettered grace that God gives to us to live out our lives in a way that honors him. May we rest soundly on the gospel, our foundation in faith.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Titus 3:1-15, 2 Corinthians 1:3-11, Ephesians 2:8-10\n\nGoodness, this passage reads like such good advice! The kind of advice I usually receive is more like:\n\nLay the baby on her front. (Read: late 80s.)\nLay the baby on her back. (Read: early 90s.)\nDon’t sit on cold concrete. (Why?)\nClean the baseboards every week. (Please don’t make me.)\nIf you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all. (This is actually pretty good advice.)\nNever miss an opportunity to go to the lavatory. (It’s just true.)\n\nOf course, receiving good advice and following it are two very different things. (I definitely don’t keep my baseboards properly cleaned.) We are often tempted to think that just knowing the right thing should be enough, a kind of salvation-by-information or salvation-by-education. But, as Paul points out, we aren’t the kind of people who just need another good bit of advice. We aren’t following the good advice we’ve already heard.\n\nIn fact, Paul is writing something much different from an advice column. He is talking about a transformation of life. We, left to ourselves “were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures” (Titus 3:3). And it wasn’t merely a bit of good advice that saved us. It was not someone offering an odious, “Here’s what you oughta do…” No, it was grace. God poured out His Spirit on us through Jesus Christ. We were justified, not by following a nifty list of suggestions, but purely by grace.\n\nThis salvation by grace, through Christ, by the work of His Spirit, is what we are to insist on. It is this which actually transforms us. Yes, there are things we ought to do and ought not to do, but grace alone is sufficient to transform us from fools who refuse sound wisdom, to sons and daughters who walk in the righteousness of Christ. “Insist on these things,” Paul says, “so that those who have believed God might be careful to devote themselves to good works” (v. 8). Devotion to good works is the fruit of God’s gracious work of transformation.\n\nDon’t worry about advice. It’s tempting to read Paul’s words as a list of how we are falling short, and how we need to change our behavior so we fit in as God’s kind of people. We are already God’s people. While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. And because of His sacrifice and His grace, He is changing us from the inside out. The work is done by Him. Step into the waters of regeneration and walk out a new creation. Paul is describing a whole new kind of humanity, one not achieved by human effort, but by God’s redemptive grace.\n\nThanks be to God!\n\n",

As a senior in college I enrolled in a sculpture class—while majoring in German. I understand words, but I do not understand shapes. Trying to sculpt a three-dimensional representation of the human head turned out to be the only collegiate task that could reliably make me cry. I could not comprehend how to shape the turn of a lip or the curve of a nose. The rest of the class would talk about differing angles or closing one eye while looking at the model, but it was an impenetrable mystery to me.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews is trying to explain something completely different to an audience of Jewish Christians who were already being persecuted for their faith. Though they were believers, the concept of Jesus as Messiah was something would have been difficult to imagine until about 70 years prior, when Jesus was born. Some knew He was the Savior, although what that meant to them varied and was still largely misunderstood. The author is still trying to introduce us to this nearly incomprehensible concept: the God-Man. Without talking down to the reader, he explains clearly, from the very beginning, the nature of this strange and wonderful person who is both God and man.\n\nIn the first chapter of Hebrews, the writer essentially asks the question, What is the nature of the Son? and what’s more, Why does the nature of the Son matter? \n\nFirst, the Son replaces the prophets and fulfills their prophecies. He is both the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of God’s nature. Worthy of all worship, He is superior to the angels and remains the same forever (Hebrews 1:3–11). Indeed, God “has spoken to us by his Son” and “has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him” (vv.1–2). \n\nHow awesome is Christ, the Son! And yet this very Christ, the creator and sustainer of the world, is also the One who purifies us from our sin by His own sacrifice. He speaks directly to us and acts on our behalf—the same God whom all the fiery angels serve! Both the new covenant and the eternal priesthood of Christ are the unfathomable gift of God to a sinful people in need of a Savior.\n\nWithout Christ there is an overwhelming barrier between us and God, between our sinfulness and His holiness. But in Christ we find an even more overwhelming answer. We cannot comprehend the greatness of His glory or the awesomeness of His majesty, yet in Christ we are made daughters and heirs of His kingdom, having been washed clean by His blood.\n\n",

But today’s passage in Hebrews starts with a verse containing the conjunctive adverb, “therefore” (the CSB translates it “for this reason”), so a little grammar ditty may help remind us what exactly a conjunction is and, well, how it functions. \n\nLike a regular conjunction (such as “and” or “but”), a conjunctive adverb connects two words or clauses; however, it also shows the relationship between two ideas. Therefore, the author of Hebrews must be trying to draw a connection for us between two related thoughts. While we can assume the writer didn’t set out to begin the chapter this way (chapters weren’t added to the Bible until the 1200s), we can look back to the preceding chapter to see what the first idea is.\n\nIn chapter 1, the author establishes that Jesus is the Son of God, and that He is superior to the angels in authority, as Creator, and in His role as the author of our salvation. In chapter 2, we read that because Jesus is superior to the angels, believers should hold tight to their belief in Him (v.1). That while He is superior to everything and everyone we could ever imagine, He is also the God who remembers us and cares for us (v.6). \n\nAt the time of this letter, the original audience of Hebrews was in danger of walking away from their faith. They were persecuted, misunderstood, and targeted for their belief in Jesus Christ. And so the author is writing a book-long defense of believing in Jesus, beginning with this one conjunctive adverb: therefore or because.\n\nBecause Jesus is superior to the angels…\nBecause His gospel is better than the Law given to Moses…\nBecause Jesus is co-equal with God, but also because He became fully man…\nBecause of His signs and wonders and miracles…\nBecause everything is subjected under His feet…\nBecause of His suffering and death—\nListen! Don’t drift away. \n\nThe temptation to drift away was not just a concern for this audience of Jewish Christians; it is real for all of us, all of the time. From the ancient believers who found themselves facing death or being treated as outcasts because of their faith, to modern-day believers like us who struggle to believe for a myriad reasons, this passage in Hebrews reminds us that our faith is anchored in the person and work of Jesus. \n\nAll of Hebrews sings this song: Jesus is who He said He was, and He is who God promised He would be. Therefore, we believe.\n\n",

We’d just made an offer on the place and were giving my husband’s family a tour when his grandpa (affectionately known to us as Papaw) said, “I remember when I built this house.” \n\nWe bumped into each other at the base of our oak staircase banister as if someone had just pulled an invisible emergency break, bringing the tour to an abrupt stop.\n\n“You built this house?” we asked, astounded. \n\nOur home was built long before either of us was born. Papaw was a much younger man then, running his own contractor business. We’d picked out our house online and made an offer on the spot without even considering who had laid the foundation so many years before. The idea that we had chosen a home carefully constructed by a man who chose to love us was a precious dose of unexpected grace.  \n\nPapaw is gone now and we are blessed to remember him every time we run our hands down the banister he installed, shuffle our socked feet across the hardwood floors he laid, or gaze out the large picture window he set into place. Our house is more sacred to us because of whose hands swung the hammer that put it together. \n\nIn today’s passages, the writer of Hebrews is asking his readers to lift their eyes off of Moses and onto the Greater One. We might not fixate so much on the greatness of Moses these days, but we do tend to treasure the wrong prize. A cosmic shift occurs in our souls when we acknowledge that everything we love and treasure ultimately belongs to God. It all matters because He matters so much. “Now every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God” (Hebrews 3:4). \n\nThis circles back and underscores a thought from the second chapter of Hebrews. We find it sandwiched between two commas, yet it deserves its own exclamation point: “For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, is bringing so many sons to glory…” (v.10). \n\nWe hear it in the words of Colossians 1: “For everything was created by him, in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things have been created through him and for him” (v.16). \n\nAnd we see it again in the first chapter of John’s Gospel. It reads: “All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created” (v.3). \n\nIt’s tempting to think we’re the ones buildings something here: We’re building a family. We’re building a career. We’re building a home. But all of these things are God’s handiwork; they are already His. He crafted it long ago—every beam, every person, every bloom. \n\nJust like the Hebrews, we tend to elevate the message over the Messiah, the prophet over the High Priest, the creation above the Creator. But Scripture pulls an invisible emergency break on this tour of our pride. How much better it is to trust in the Builder than in the building (Hebrews 2:13). Our lives become more precious and our hands more open when we acknowledge that it’s all His—made by Him and for Him, and given to us to enjoy as His beloved children. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 3:7-19, John 3:16-21, Romans 11:1-6\n\nHands down, my favorite day of the year during elementary school was field day. On field day, each class wore matching t-shirts and competed in outdoor events like the 100-yard dash, Red Rover, and the ultimate team challenge: tug-of-war.\n\nI always felt a rush of nerves as my class stepped up to the rope to compete against the other classes in our grade. I was tall and lanky, not the strongest kid, but I knew none of that mattered in tug-of-war, because it took everyone’s strength to win, not just mine. And when I got tired, I could loosen my grip knowing my classmates would pick up the slack.\n\nOur passage today points to this type of teamwork—not in the context of field day, of course, but in the context of faith and the community effort it so often requires.\n\nWe can assume some individuals from the community addressed in Hebrews had been loosening their grip on their faith, swaying toward unbelief, the type of unbelief that leads to rebellion against God. The writer warns, “Watch out, brothers and sisters, so that there won’t be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God” (Hebrews 3:12).\n\nAs God’s people, we have a long history of this type of unbelief. From the Israelites wandering in the desert, to the early church addressed here in Hebrews, to Christians today—our tendency is to believe in ourselves and our own way over God and His. Fortunately, the writer of Hebrews provides a strategy to guard ourselves against unbelief: \n\n“But encourage each other daily, while it is still called today,\nso that none of you is hardened by sin’s deception” (v.13).\nIn other words, if you want to stay away from unbelief, stay together.\n\nThe more I walk this road of faith, the more I realize how corporate the practice of faith must be if we are going to maintain it. The very nature of our faith is communal. We serve a triune God who from the beginning has been committed to communing with us. So much so, that He came to be with us in human form through the person of Jesus Christ, who then died so that we might commune with God for eternity.\n\nWe are not meant to believe alone. I think this is why the writer of Hebrews so earnestly warns against unbelief, and then in the same breath reminds us to encourage one another. When I am on the brink of unbelief, it is always community that pulls me back to the truth of the gospel. If I’d had to face the other team alone, I surely would have abandoned the rope long ago. But knowing I have others there who have strength when I don’t has provided the encouragement I’ve needed to stay in the game.  \n\nThis is why I find this passage so hopeful. Just as much as it is a warning against unbelief, it is also a reminder that we don’t have to go up against unbelief alone. Because our Messiah is our companion, we have companionship with each other.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 4:1-13, Psalm 95:7-11, 1 Peter 1:3-5\n\nThe promised rest.\n\nIn today’s busy culture, especially in the United States, that phrase seems too good to be true. I tend to crave rest in different ways, depending on the season I’m in. When I was in college, running myself ragged, I would have given anything for a quick cat nap during the day, but now I just long for a solid eight hours of sleep at night. \n\nThe kind of rest described in Hebrews chapter 4 is not the nap our bodies beg for after a busy day. God invited the Israelites into His rest, into the Sabbath, when they were wandering in the wilderness. However, they rebelled and did not enter into His rest because of their disobedient, discontented hearts. We are offered this same rest; it is promised to us because of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross. But the full Sabbath, the truest rest promised to us by God, will not occur until we are face to face with our Maker in eternity. \n\nIn the meantime, of course, God gives us a Sabbath each week—a day to rest, reconnect with God, and recenter our lives around Him. But if I’m honest, a real Sabbath feels unattainable to me today. Maybe the busyness our culture has come to call “normal” speaks to our true priorities. Or maybe we’re just looking at the Sabbath through the wrong lens. \n\nWhat if practicing the Sabbath includes sinking our teeth into the things that provide us with a taste of heaven? What if it’s savoring the morning light as it streams through our curtains, or relishing the feeling of propping our feet up on the coffee table after a long day of work? What if rest comes in cherishing moments of laughter and tears with the people around us who pull us closer to Jesus? What if we were to breathe all of this in as it happens, thanking God for these things in the moment, with the knowledge that our ultimate rest—our eternal salvation—is secure in Christ?\n\nThe true rest we long for will not fully come this side of heaven. The author of Hebrews tells us “a Sabbath rest remains for God’s people” (4:9). He encourages us to “make every effort to enter that rest” (v.11). The price has already been paid by Jesus. The “effort” we now make is to remain in Him as He remains in us (John 15:4). So we continue the work He’s given us to do, living in the tension that the kingdom of God is here and now, but also still to come and greater than we can imagine. We keep leaning in to God for strength as He builds His kingdom through us. And we find Sabbath rest where we are, in the presence of God Most High.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 4:14-16, Hebrews 5:1-10, Psalm 110:1-7, Matthew 4:1-11\n\nI used to think I had to sacrifice a lot of things in order for God to love me. \n\nI have this vivid memory from my high school youth group. At one particular meeting, we listened to one of the “stars” of our youth group give a testimony about how he believed God was calling him to quit baseball and give all his time and energy to God. So he quit. His choice to make a big sacrifice was glorified and applauded. And I wondered, What is God calling me to sacrifice? What do I have to give up for Him to love me? What would be enough?\n\nOof.\n\nIt took me years to identify how traumatic that message was for me. Though I don’t aim to judge one person’s actions and how they follow the promptings of the Spirit, the glamorization of that choice was embedded in my mind. I lived in fear that if I didn’t sacrifice the things I loved to do or wear or make or buy, then I wasn’t doing enough for God. I thought He would punish me instead.\n\nAnd so I walked around afraid that God was going to take everything and everyone I loved away from me. I began to see my relationship with Him as a give-and-take where He only took, and I only gave. I didn’t know that is literally the opposite of what the Bible tells us.\n\nI didn’t understand that what I owe to God is more than I could ever give. I didn’t understand that “sacrificing” wouldn’t make me a better Christian. In fact, it wouldn’t make me a Christian at all. I didn’t understand that the debt I owe to God is because of my sin, and that Jesus is the only One who could pay it. Without Jesus, I was—and I am—helpless to stand before God.\n\nThe truth is God does require something for the payment of our sins, because His is a perfect justice. But thankfully, the balance of His mercy does not rest on me. It rests solely on Jesus, who “became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him” (Hebrews 5:9).\n\nThe closing verse of Edward Mote’s classic hymn, “My Hope is Built on Nothing Less,” says: Oh, may I then in Him be found, / dressed in His righteousness alone, / faultless to stand before the throne. Today’s passage from Hebrews beckons us to do the same, to “approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in time of need” (Hebrews 4:16).\n\nBoldness. Some translations say “with confidence,” which we have only in the security of Christ. We don’t have to approach the throne with fear, with everything we love bundled up to lay on an altar, thinking that what we have to offer is somehow going to be enough to pay for our sin—because it isn’t.\n\nOnly Jesus is enough.\n\nJesus is our Great High Priest (v.14). Traditionally, high priests would offer sacrifices to atone for the sins of the people and themselves, because they sinned too. But Jesus’s sinless perfection made His sacrifice the source of eternal salvation for everyone who would ever believe.\n\nThis is an eternal, unchanging truth: We are not enough. Only Christ’s righteousness allows us to approach God’s throne with confidence, to receive the grace and mercy He offers us.\n\nThanks be to God!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 5:11-14, Hebrews 6:1-12, Philippians 3:12-16, 1 Peter 2:1-3\n\nI feel like I’m a great gal. I go to church (but only when all five of my kids aren’t sick). I read my Bible (unless I am very tired or very busy or extremely lazy). I pray (especially when I have lost my glasses). And I write about Scripture (because it’s my dream job and people pay me to do it). \n\nOkay, so I’m a great gal with some mixed motives. But here’s the trouble: It’s actually pretty possible to look like a believer, enjoy the fellowship of believers, and even do a lot of the right things externally, but still not touch the heart of the matter. It’s possible to do all of these things without maturing in the faith and truly knowing God. \n\nAll of these good works may make me think I’m a great gal. They can certainly look like the fruit of the gospel at work in my life. But Scripture tells us our works are dead when we depend on them for our salvation (Romans 3:27–4:5). The author of Hebrews is warning us to stop focusing on such “elementary teaching about Christ and go on to maturity” (Hebrews 6:1).\n\nNo matter how many orphanages you visit in Haiti, you cannot save yourself. No matter how many women you rescue out of slavery, you cannot rescue yourself. Christ alone saves us. His desire is that we grow in maturity by the Holy Spirit, working out our faith to full assurance, which is only found in Christ (v.11).\n\nIf we are keeping lists of our own merits, even if just in our heads and hearts, it is a real danger. We cannot work our way to righteousness. But the temptation to rely on our own merits is powerful. The Church is warned about this in no uncertain terms. If we seek after good works more than we desire Christ, we are in grave danger. Beware, lest we fall away and come short of salvation! Only Christ is sufficient to save.\n\nYet “God is not unjust; he will not forget [our] work and the love [we] demonstrated for his name by serving the saints—and by continuing to serve them” (v.10). When we look to Christ for our salvation, our humble doings flow from gratitude to the One who saves us. We love others because we imitate the One who is love (1 John 4:8). We serve because He is the servant of all. Our good works don’t earn our salvation; they are the result of our salvation, fruit born of the Holy Spirit at work in us (Galatians 5:22–23).\n\nLet us look beyond the work of our own hands and instead place our hope in Christ’s finished work on the cross. May we hear His call to daily repentance and obedience. And may our works flow out of total thankfulness to God, our Creator and Redeemer.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 6:13-20, Hebrews 7:1-10, Genesis 22:15-18, Romans 8:28-30\n\nI discovered my first gray hair this week. Being in my mid-twenties, I’ve always believed this event would unfold naturally and gracefully decades from now, like a badge of honor for a seasoned and experienced woman. It did not happen that way. However, as I sifted through my dark brown strands to find the one that wasn’t, I couldn’t help but think of my grandmother. I’ve never gotten through a conversation with someone who knew Polly without mention of her rare poise, cheeks full of laughter, and of course, her beautiful silver hair.\n\nThere are some things I inherited right away from my grandmother, like the pearl earrings she’d received on a special anniversary and the cooking tools that still smelled like her house. I inherited her love for music, the same knack for penmanship, and a preference for extra-sour lemonade. And then there are things I didn’t know I’d get from Polly, even after she was gone—things like her fountain pen, which my aunt gave me because I became a writer, and the aforementioned early appearance of gray hairs.\n\nThere’s something about an inheritance that roots you in a sense of belonging. Or in some cases, you find out there’s been a place for you all along. In Hebrews 6, we find that our inheritance is both current and eternal. It is everything we need, exactly what we’d hoped, and all we never thought to ask for.\n\nI love how thorough God is in His promises. It’s as if He takes joy in watching His children read His Word and learn His Will, savoring each gift along the way. Two big themes in the book of Hebrews are revelation and redemption, and God’s covenant with His people is what bridges the two.\n\n“Because God wanted to show his unchangeable purpose even more clearly to the heirs of the promise, he guaranteed it with an oath, so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us” (Hebrews 6:17–18). Notice the two unchangeable things here: God’s promise and God’s oath. He wants to make doubly sure we know that our inheritance in Him is true.\n\nMaybe we don’t realize our inheritance through the way we age or through hand-me-downs in the cupboard, but just like He did for Abraham, God makes sure we know we’ve obtained the promise. He is the only One who can give us the sweetest inheritance of all: Himself. “We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure” (Hebrews 6:19). May we continue to hold fast to Him, our hope and our prize. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 7:11-28, Genesis 14:18-20, 1 John 2:1\n\nI am raising four boys on a farm full of mud. \n\nThrough much threatening, cajoling, scrubbing and—okay, I’ll admit it—bribing, I can occasionally get everyone clean. But there isn’t enough soap and water in the universe to ensure that they will stay clean. Most often, we don’t even make it to the car before someone (or everyone) becomes more soiled than spiffed up. \n\nThe Levitical priests could surely more than feel my pain. Once a year they would go to great lengths to ask the Lord to clean out the record of sin accumulated by His people. After extensive preparations, a priest would enter the most holy place inside the veil to present a sin offering (Leviticus 16:2–34). Verse 30 tells us: “Atonement will be made for you on this day to cleanse you, and you will be clean from all your sins before the LORD.” And so when the priest exited, God’s people were clean. It was a holy scrubbing, but never a permanent one. \n\nYear after year, the priests would enter the tabernacle to atone for the people’s sins, only to return again a year later. This was not an exercise in futility, but God’s provisional means of covering their sin. It was also an object lesson for generations to come, teaching them that nothing we could ever do—no matter how meticulously planned and executed—to make these “filthy rags” clean. We can scrub and scrub and scrub and the muck of sin will stick to us, making it impossible for us to be in the presence of our holy, holy, holy God (Revelation 4:8).  \n\nSo we keep scouring, don’t we? Until our hearts and souls feel raw from the effort. We need the reminder that we cannot obtain perfection through human striving. God’s law doesn’t polish us up to a high shine; instead, it exposes every gritty imperfection (v.19). \n\nThe priests couldn’t keep us clean because they were stained by sin too. We’ve always been the blind leading the blind, the stained scrubbing the stained. We needed someone untarnished by sin to enter the Holy Place on our behalf. “For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens” (v.26). Christ is the true high priest, and His is the superior priesthood. He is the only permanent solution to our sin problem. His blood alone, shed on the cross, has the power to truly cleanse us. \n\nThe lyrics of Elisha A. Hoffman’s old gospel hymn, “Are You Washed in the Blood of the Lamb,” sum it up well:\n\nHave you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?…\nAre your garments spotless?\nAre they white as snow?\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?\n\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is an invitation to stop our scrubbing and to bathe in the deluge of grace that flows from the cross. Our perfect Savior made a way for us to be cleansed—permanently. May we fully trust in His grace this hour, and the next, and all the ones to follow.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 8:1-6, Zechariah 6:12-13, John 10:14-18, Romans 11:33-36, Romans 12:1-2\n\nIn college, I visited a monastery built on the side of a cliff. To get there, we traveled to a remote location in central China on a bus that swayed along treacherous roads. I refused to look out the window for the majority of the drive because I was certain my gaze would draw us down to the canyon below. But soon enough a series of brown tapered roofs came into focus, hanging from the side of the mountain like an ancient rock climber with a strong grip. \n\nTo this day, Xuan Kong Monastery—also known as “the Hanging Monastery”—is one of the most interesting places of religious worship I’ve ever visited. Built 1,400 years ago, the walls and floors creaked with every step. My sense of awe may have actually been fear as I walked the narrow hallways, worried that at any moment the whole thing might crumble to the ground.\n\nNot too long ago, I read through a She Reads Truth study called See the Lord’s Salvation: A Lenten Study of Exodus, where I studied the God-given plans for another remarkable place of worship, one designed to honor God and built by His chosen people, the Israelites. (Go back to this study of Exodus to see the deep and intricate meaning of each detail in those plans.) But no matter how beautiful the tabernacle might have been, it was a human creation, a copy and a shadow of what was in heaven (Hebrews 8:5). Just like the Hanging Monastery in China, the tabernacle was fragile.\n\nOur churches and pastors and priests today are weak too. The walls creak. The leaders fail. Sometimes it feels like the sanctuaries do nothing more than remind us of our need. If that’s all they do, I’m okay with that. I need a better priest than the best on earth. I need a better temple.\n\nHere’s what’s amazing. “The true tabernacle set up by the Lord” (v.2) isn’t a destination with walls and nails. It is a communion we have with God in our hearts. For we are God’s temple and the Spirit of God lives in us (1 Corinthians 3:16–17). And Jesus, our High Priest and Good Shepherd, “is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises” (Hebrews 8:6). \n\nJesus is the kind of priest we need in a better sanctuary than we could ever build. He takes us with all our heartsickness, sin, and need, and gives us access to the Father. In that secret room, the one in our spirit, our Father waits, ready to meet with us. \n\n",

It’s hard to imagine things will ever look much different than this, what’s right in front of us today. \n\nI doubt that even the most imaginative Israelites in Egypt could have fathomed their miraculous escape from slavery across the dry ocean floor (Exodus 13:17–14:31). The disciples huddled together in Jerusalem could not have foreseen the power of Pentecost, even in their wildest dreams. I mean, tongues of fire? Crazy! (Acts 2:3). And when we were slaves to our sin, we could not have comprehend being truly free (Romans 6:17; John 8:36). It seems our God is always moving us toward something better, something brighter—something more than we dare to ask, imagine, or hope for (Ephesians 3:20). \n\nThose who worshiped under the Old Testament covenant surely could not have grasped all that Jesus would usher in. That a day would dawn when sacrifices of animal blood were no longer required because Christ’s blood was sufficient to atone once and for all. That God’s presence wouldn’t rest between the angel’s wings on the ark of the covenant (Exodus 25:17–22), but would move freely in our hearts. That a time was coming when the law would not be written on slabs of stone, but instead on the hearts and minds of God’s beloved children (Jeremiah 31:33). That the curtain of the tabernacle would be torn in two, making a way for sinners to enter the presence of God (Matthew 27:51). \n\nYet, here we are, “speaking of a new covenant, [by which] he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away” (Hebrews 8:13). Today, we are the recipients of the avalanche of grace Moses could only dream of. We are free in a way even the Israelites who fled Egypt never knew. Under the new covenant, we have been saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. This is a gift from God by which all our wrongdoing is forgiven, our sins never to be remembered again (Ephesians 2:8–9; Hebrews 8:12).\n\nThe old is gone and the new, superior covenant of grace is better than our wildest hopes. But we are also broken people, still stuck in this broken world and so easily convinced that this is all there is. Yet God is moving us onward, toward something unthinkably good. All that we see is ready to vanish away because our God is making all things new (Revelation 21:1–5).\n\nMaybe you can’t quite picture it. Perhaps your heart doesn’t dare believe it, but that won’t stop the Lord from delivering it. The best is truly yet to come.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 9:1-15, Leviticus 16:6-19, 2 Corinthians 1:10\n\nMaybe it’s this season of life I’m in where everything seems ridden with uncertainty and doubt, but sometimes it’s hard for me to remember that God is near to me. It’s hard for me to remember that I have access to Him through the Holy Spirit at all times. It’s hard for me to remember that even when I don’t have the words to speak, He still listens.\n\nUnder the old covenant described in the first part of Hebrews 9, God’s people were unable to communicate with Him directly. While the priests could enter into the first room of the tabernacle to perform their ministry of sacrifices, God’s presence was contained inside the holy of holies of the tabernacle, a place only the high priest could enter but once a year, and only then to provide a sacrifice for himself and God’s people to cover the sins they had committed. \n\nThe author of Hebrews consistently uses Old Testament references and stories to tell his readers about the better hope they have in Christ. In referencing the old covenant, which they were undoubtedly familiar with, the author is reminding them of the freedom they now have in Christ—freedom to acknowledge God’s nearness and drink in His presence. Christ took the place of the high priest, entering into the most holy place, sacrificing Himself, and cleansing us with His blood (Hebrews 9:11–14). \n\n“[Christ] is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance, because a death has taken place for redemption from the transgressions committed under the first covenant” (v.15).\n\nChrist is the Great High Priest, and because of His sacrifice on the cross, God is ever-present with us. We don’t have to rely on a human high priest to go before God on our behalf; Christ does that for us. He looks at us and says that we are His children, His people—that nothing can separate us from His love (Romans 8:38).\n\nIt’s not always easy to remember that we have instant access to our Father. In situations where we don’t know what to say or pray or do, we feel alone. We forget He is already near to us—nearer than our very breath. But reminders of this new covenant ministry, a ministry we are now an active part of, keep us grounded in the knowledge that God is with us and for us. Always.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "What Forgiveness Requires",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 9:16-28, John 10:10, 2 Timothy 1:8-10\n\nWhat is the cost of forgiveness? \n\nI can forgive my husband for forgetting to feed the dogs and it costs me nothing. I can forgive someone for hurting my child, but it costs me a little more. I can even forgive the person who has hurt me most in this world, and it still costs me only the decision to forgive, even if I have to make the decision again and again. But what good does my forgiveness render? Certainly peace for me, and possibly some kind of peace for the one I forgive.\n\nOur forgiveness is vitally important, but there is a greater forgiveness that changes everything. Our forgiveness doesn’t actually yield eternal pardon for the offender, and that’s why it doesn’t cost us much. But in order to actually pay for one transgression of God’s law, someone has to literally die. That’s the deal. The wages of sin is actual death (Romans 6:23). A sacrifice must be made. But the sacrifice has to be totally without sin, so none of us can just valiantly die for our own sins. We need a sinless sacrifice. \n\nOur forgiveness is only possible because Christ is that sinless sacrifice. \n\nNow, because sin has been paid for, we have life and joy abundantly. By sacrificing Himself, He has removed our sins (Hebrews 9:26). When Christ comes again, He will come bringing the fulfillment of our salvation: everlasting life in glory.\n\nThis passage in Hebrews 9 seems to be about establishing the justice and legality of what Christ did. It is delivered in covenantal and transactional terms. Why? It is important to know that what Christ did, He did rightly. He didn’t cut corners, or sweep sin under the rug. He dealt with it fully, fairly, finally. Because of this, we can have great assurance and security in Christ. When Satan attempts to undermine our faith with doubt, we can lean on our righteousness of Christ. His payment for sin is fully sufficient. His grace is greater than all our sin, and nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews further his point with a comparison. The first covenant was also inaugurated with blood (v.18). But all the blood of bulls and goats could not fully satisfy the demands of justice. The blood of animals was sprinkled on the earthly tabernacle and its furnishings. But the blood of Christ, the only perfect and sufficient sacrifice, has purified even the heavenly things (v.23). His payment for our sin has paid our debt from the depths of earth to the heights of heaven.\n\nForgiveness requires the shedding of blood. And Christ’s blood has been shed for us. \n\nWhat then can man do to us? What can Satan say to topple such a salvation? Thanks be to God, we are secure in Christ. When Christ returns, we are told, He will come, not to pay a further debt (all our sins have been paid for!), but to bring salvation (v.28). Praise the Lord!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 10:1-18, Psalm 40:1-17, 1 Peter 2:24\n\nTwice, my girlfriends have talked me into running a half marathon. And twice, my knees have revolted. Both times I hobbled across that finish line, I was so ready to be done. But can you imagine if I had decided to just keep running? I surely cannot. Yet, oftentimes in our spiritual lives we keep running a race that’s already been won. We keep thinking that if we just jog another lap, add on a few more miles, somehow we will be more qualified.\n\nThe thing is, Jesus ran the perfect race and won the final victory for us. With the sacrifice of His life He proclaimed, “It is finished” (John 19:28–30). So why don’t we accept the gift of grace? And if we have accepted it, why don’t we choose to live into it?\n\nGrace can be difficult to accept. While we all want forgiveness and unconditional love, the world has taught us that forgiveness is not easily won and love always comes with limits. It can be hard to live in the reality of God, in the truth of the gospel. We might picture our heavenly Father like an earthly one, disappointed or angry or withholding. We might think He judges us with a harsh eye. But God’s love is like nothing in this world, and until we open our hearts to His grace we will keep on needlessly trying to prove ourselves.\n\nUnlike the priests who had to daily return to their work, when Jesus offered His sufficient “sacrifice for sins forever, [He] sat down at the right hand of God” (Hebrews 10:12). He sat down. This symbolized completeness and finality. He didn’t pace around. He didn’t wring His hands. He didn’t find more busywork to do. He sat down at the right hand of His Father.\n\nChrist’s sacrifice is complete. It was also made “once for all time” (Hebrews 10:10), which means the gospel is always fresh. And because our hearts so easily forget this news that seems too good to be true, we need to be reminded again and again: every morning when we step out of bed, weary from a world we’ve barely woken to, every time we stumble and fall, and every time we believe the lie that we need to somehow earn the love of God. The repeated sacrifices of the old covenant can now be replaced with repeated proclamations of the gospel to ourselves and to our brothers and sisters.\n\nMaybe God is inviting you to sit down at His feet today—to just be with Him. To soak yourself in Christ’s finished work for you. You are saved, not by your own will or work, but by the perfect blood of Jesus. Rest easy in the presence of your Redeemer.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 10:19-39, Deuteronomy 32:35-36, Matthew 27:50-54\n\nThe universal law of cause and effect says that for every effect there is a cause, and likewise, for every cause there is an effect. Why am I giving you a refresher course in seventh-grade natural science? Because applying this law to our passage today is crucial in understanding hope in light of Christ’s faithfulness to us.\n\nHebrews 10:23 says, “Let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, since he who promised is faithful.” With “since” being the key word, we can determine that the law of cause and effect applied to this verse would go something like this:\n\nCause: He who promised is faithful.\n\nEffect: We hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering.\n\nWhat if we changed the placement of the word “since” to read, “Since we hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, he who promised is faithful”? It would entirely change our cause and effect, right?\n\nCause: We hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering.\n\nEffect: He who promised is faithful.\n\nIn the first set of cause-and-effect statements, we hold on to hope because Christ has been faithful to us. In the second, Christ is faithful to us because we hold on to hope.\n\nIf Christ’s faithfulness to me is contingent upon my hope, I’m in big trouble. My hope is not consistent. It varies from day to day, depending upon my circumstances, the weather, or how much coffee I’ve had. My hope can be high one hour and plummet the next.\n\nFortunately, Hebrews does not say we hold on to hope because we are a people who are so very good at hoping. It says we hold on to hope because Christ has been faithful. As the verses leading up to this one emphasize, “since we have boldness to enter the sanctuary through the blood of Jesus… and since we have a great high priest over the house of God… let us draw near… Let us hold on to the confession of our hope” (Hebrews 10:19,21–23).\n\nThe blood of Jesus, our Great High Priest, His faithfulness—this is why we hold on to hope.\n\nIt has taken me a long time to grasp this idea that living a life of faith is so much more about God’s faithfulness to me than it is my faithfulness to Him. To be honest, I still don’t think I completely get it. If I did, I would have far less anxiety, I would sin far less, and I would have much more hope. I need this reminder as much as the early Church did. When I feel hopeless, I need to repeat the cause again and again:\n\nSince He…\nSince He…\nSince He…\n\nHave hope today—not in your ability to hold onto hope, but in Christ’s faithfulness to you. It does not waver. It is the same day in and day out—yesterday, today, and forever. When we rely on His faithfulness alone, our posture toward life will be one of hope and not fear, of trust and not turning away. As the writer said, “We are not those who draw back and are destroyed, but those who have faith and obtain life” (v.39).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Living by Faith",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 11:1-16, Psalm 33:6-7, John 1:9-13\n\nI recently read a novel by Min Jin Lee called Pachinko. Set in WWII, the story follows an immigrant Korean family that lives in Japan for four generations. The book chronicles their bold acts of faith, fortitude, and survival in the midst of oppression and racial prejudice. I won’t spoil the ending here, but rest assured the ending isn’t what makes the book worth reading. It’s the beginning, middle, and end, all woven together like a symphony. I’ve bought multiple copies, handing them out like candy.\n\nLikewise, the author of Hebrews recounts a family history. Our family history. Each tale is a marriage of belief and action—basically, faith and verbs. \n\nBy faith Abel offered.\nBy faith Noah built.\nBy faith Abraham obeyed and went.\nBy faith Sarah received.\n\nIt’s important to take a moment to really consider what those verbs cost our ancestors. Though Abel’s gift was accepted by God, he was still violently murdered by his brother. Though the ark provided rescue to Noah, he still suffered years of ridicule from his neighbors. Though God kept His promises to Abraham, Abraham still had to walk away from everything he knew and follow God into the desert. As the author of Hebrews says:\n\n“These all died in faith, without having received the promises, but they saw them from a distance, greeted them, and confessed that they were foreigners and temporary residents on earth. Now those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland” (Hebrews 11:13–14).\n\nI think the reason I like Pachinko so much is that it introduces a family seeking a homeland, experiencing rejection in the place where they live. As a Christian, I seek to embrace that same humbleness, embracing the truth that I am a temporary resident here on earth. This is not my final home. For that reason, I can sacrifice it all, including the comfort of home, if that is what God calls me to do. \n\nThese passages prompt me to ask myself: What are the verbs that God is asking me to act out in my life? Can I boldly trust that He will use those actions for His glory, no matter the cost? No matter the ending?\n\nOne thing is certain: God never spoils an ending. And He makes promises I can hold on to while I walk through the middle. I am chosen and never forsaken. God will go with me—He always arrives to the scene first, and acts as my rearguard. God promises He will complete the good work He started in me (Philippians 1:6). He promises that nothing will be wasted, but all things will be restored (Revelation 21:4–5). While I take these steps, any tears I shed will be like liquid words and God promises to read and store them all (Psalm 56:8).\n\nBut this is about more than just me and you. The author of Hebrews says that acts of faith make non-believers turn and watch. In other words, when we put our our faith into action, we create living proof to a dying world that God exists. Our “faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen” (Hebrews 11:1).\n\nThat is no small thing.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 11:17-40, Luke 13:34-35, James 1:2-4\n\nIt was my cab driver in Boston who lead me to the best cannolis I’ve ever had. “Skip the main bakery location downtown,” he suggested. “Walk a few blocks north and you’ll find the exact same thing without the wait.”\n\nIt was a shop owner in Austin who recommended I visit what I now refer to as “my most favorite bookstore of all time.” You could say I liked it, alright.\n\nIt was my friend in Chicago who knew precisely which building had the best views of the city skyline, and could tell me the history behind every structure and monument in sight.\n\nAnd if you visited my city, Nashville, I’d show you the live music venue with a back alley, so you can enter with the locals and avoid the throes of tourists. Oh, and I’d probably already have put in a request for your favorite song to make sure you sing karaoke before the night is over.\n\nRegardless of where you’re going, everyone knows the best way to find the best tips: ask the locals. Your server at dinner will have more insight than any guidebook you read on the plane, and the friend you’re staying with is guaranteed to keep you from going to the restaurants that didn’t live up to their online reviews.\n\nBut when it comes to faith, it’s even more important to have a guide. And when it comes to struggle or not knowing where to turn, the best thing to have on your side is someone who’s been through it before you. And that’s exactly what we’re given in Hebrews 11: examples of people who have lived by faith. “Faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen” (v.1), and yet, God is gracious enough to fill our eyes with hopeful images of our brothers and sisters who have successfully lived by the words He has promised.\n\nWe’re reminded of Abel’s sacrifice, Enoch’s protection, Noah’s motivation, Abraham’s obedience, Sarah’s conception, Isaac’s birth, Jacob’s worship, and Moses’s suffering—“all these were approved through their faith” (v. 39). But we’re given these examples not because we’re supposed to be more like each of these human men and women, but because they, too, were afraid. They, too, were unsure and doubtful and wondering if the things they were putting their trust in were actually real. They, too, hoped their faith was more than just wishful thinking.\n\nInside God’s Word, we get to learn from the locals, those who have gone before us and have seen the goodness and truth of our God in all things. But even better, we see time and time again that their go-to move isn’t to look to their own flesh for answers—it’s to ask their Creator. Their stories invite us to do the same, joining a long, tried-and-true legacy of faith.\n\nThe stories of God’s people point us to His face. May they continue to do so, and may our own stories be marked by faith as well. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Call to Endurance",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 12:1-13, Romans 12:18-21, 1 Timothy 2:5-6\n\nJesus invited His followers to take up their crosses and follow Him. From the outset of His ministry, He wanted us to know that the Christian life is not free from struggle. The writer of Hebrews encourages believers to “strengthen your tired hands and weakened knees” (Hebrews 12:12). Tired hands and weakened knees are not the result of a life on cruise control; they are the result of labor, opposition, and striving.\n\nSome of us may be all too familiar with this reality. Through trial and tribulation, we’ve become well aware that the way of Jesus isn’t always the smoothest path. Still, in times of plenty there is a tendency to brush over the hardships of faith and tough teachings of Scripture. In a comfortable season of life, we might be tempted to believe that our work as a “good Christian” means that God will bless everything we put our hands to. We can forget that walking in the way of Jesus is not without suffering and that, in Jesus, even our suffering has a redemptive purpose. \n\nListen to this encouragement from Hebrews 12:\n\n“Endure suffering as discipline: God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline? … Furthermore, we had human fathers discipline us, and we respected them. Shouldn’t we submit even more to the Father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time based on what seemed good to them, but he does it for our benefit, so that we can share his holiness. No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it” (vv.7-11).\n\nScripture is clear: God uses everything—struggle and hardship included—for the believer’s good (Romans 8:28). When we assume our way should be easy easy, we forget that Jesus promised the opposite (John 16:33). When we see all pain as a problem to avoid, we miss the opportunity to “rejoice in our afflictions, because we know that affliction produces endurance, endurance produces proven character, and proven character produces hope” (Romans 5:3–4). We miss the opportunity to become more like Christ.\n\nIt’s tempting to go through our places of struggle alone, not wanting God or anyone else to see us at a low point. But when we recognize dark days as an expected part of a life of faith, we can look to the One who has walked this road before. Jesus, our victor and champion, suffered betrayal, persecution, and excruciating death. A “man of sorrows” (Isaiah 53:3), He understands our pain. And He is with us through every hardship when we trust in Him. \n\nWhen your time of suffering comes, look to Jesus. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 12:14-29, Genesis 4:8-13, Isaiah 62:6-12\n\n“You don’t know what you have until it’s gone.” \n\nWe’ve all heard this old adage, or perhaps even experienced the painful truth of it at some point in our own lives. But it’s not really a case of not actually knowing what you had, is it? It’s more a matter of not appreciating that thing, that someone, that blessing—until it’s no longer yours. Maybe you never appreciated it because you never imagined a world in which you’d have to live without it.\n\nSuch is the case with Esau and the oh-so unwise forfeiting of his birthright to his twin brother for the immediate comfort of a home-cooked meal. Whether he truly “despised” his birthright or was merely indifferent to it, Esau did not place great enough importance on his blessing as Isaac’s firstborn son—the blessing that promised both divine protection and authority over other nations (Genesis 25:27–34; 27:29).\n\nWhile the Christians the writer of Hebrews was addressing weren’t merely fighting off hunger pangs, in the face of severe persecution they were tempted to forego their faith in Christ, exchanging the promises of the new covenant for the supposed comfort and familiarity of the old covenant. And so the writer of the book of Hebrews reminds the readers of what’s at stake, comparing the Israelites’ relationship to God at Mt. Sinai under the old covenant of the law (Exodus 19), with the blessings of salvation in Jesus Christ under the new covenant. \n\nThe comparison is a stark one. Their encounter with God at Mt. Sinai left the Israelites, and even Moses, shaken to the core (Hebrews 12:18–21). But that’s not the case for the Hebrew Christians, or for anyone whose faith is in Jesus Christ. \n\n“Instead, [we] have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God… to the assembly of the firstborn whose names have been written in heaven, to a Judge, who is God of all… and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant…” (vv.22–24).\n\nThe old covenant instilled a holy fear in the hearts of God’s people, putting a safe distance between them and God’s holiness. But the new covenant has torn away the veil separating us from God. Christ, our perfect Mediator and Judge (1 Timothy 2:5; 2 Timothy 4:8), put on skin and came down to endure the judgment of our sin. He eliminated the distance between God and His people, bringing us squarely into right and redeemed relationship with Him. “Our God is a consuming fire,” and His sacrificial love for us should should incite awe and reverence in our hearts, not indifference (Hebrews 12:29). \n\nTo know Christ is to be wrapped up in His grace—a hard-won grace that cost us nothing but did not come cheaply. It cost Jesus His life, the agony of bearing the weight of sin for all of humanity for all time and, for the first and only time in history, separation from the Father (Matthew 27:46). The writer of Hebrews is warning readers, cautioning us to not become hardened by persecution or indifferent to Jesus’s sacrifice, to the grace and salvation that can only be found in Him. “Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful” (Hebrews 12:28).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 13:1-25, Joshua 1:5-9, Matthew 25:34-40\n\nAfter thirteen chapters of establishing our great hope and exhorting us to godly living, Hebrews closes with a succinct reminder that all hope comes from Christ who is the “same yesterday, today, and forever” (Hebrews 13:8). The root of all godly living is the person of Christ. He is both our hope and our source of righteousness.\n\nAt the close of the this book, the author recommends a handful of what Matthew Henry calls “excellent duties”: show love and hospitality, care for the mistreated, honor marriage, eschew the love of money, and be satisfied with what you have. This final exhortation to contentment certainly loosens the reins and makes the other excellent duties easier. If one is content, the love of money can’t tempt and the shine of someone prettier or younger doesn’t lure.\n\nHave you ever known someone who is truly content? The author of Hebrews points us first and foremost to the example of Christ. But we are also encouraged to watch the fruit of other leaders and, if that fruit is good, imitate their faith. \n\nThe most contented person I know is Nell. You probably don’t know her; she’s not famous. I met her in college, but she wasn’t the first friend I made. She was quiet and I was so busy making sure everyone knew how much fun I was, I didn’t notice her.\n\nBut once I did notice her, I couldn’t stop. Nell doesn’t push, she doesn’t demand, even though she has stronger opinions than most. But she loves like a fountain, and she is content. These days she homeschools her six children in a small house by a river. She is teaching them the art of contentment by giving them what they need, but not what they demand. She shows them how to be content by being at peace herself. Instead of chasing the world, she has found that her rooms crowded with love hold the very best the world has to offer her.\n\nLight your corner of the world, friends—wherever it may be. And if these excellent duties of love and contentment seem impossible, do not fear; they are impossible. This is why the book of Hebrews was written: to point us always back to our need for Christ. He is our helper, “who promises to never leave us or forsake us” (v.5). \n\nLift your eyes to the eternal glory of Christ, for He is our hope in things both large and small. Any excellence and contentment that flows out of our lives will come from Him. Because of His sanctifying blood, we are made new creatures—creatures capable of hospitality and contentment. Jesus is our hope. He is our strength. And He is the same, yesterday, today, and forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nScripture Reading: James 1:1-18, Jeremiah 31:7-14, Matthew 4:1-11, 1 Peter 1:6-7\n\nHave you ever noticed how in times of pain or trial, we comfort our friends, loved ones, and even ourselves, with words like:\n\n“You’re going to make it through this.”\n“Tomorrow will be better.”\n“What can I do to ease your pain?”\n\nOur endgame is an end to suffering. We pray for the bad times to go away. We beg that they would never come at all. A whole industry of mylar balloons and teddy bears exists bearing the sentiment, “Get Well Soon!” We ask the Lord to remove our thorns, to help us endure our hardships, and to bring us through suffering as unscathed as possible. \n\nBut Jesus’ brother James, the author of this short letter, has an entirely different take on trials.\n\n“Consider it a great joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you experience various trials.” –James 1:2\n\nDon’t get over them. Don’t rush through them or past them. Rejoice in them.\n\nJames tells us not to be so hasty to escape the faith-testing valleys because those valleys contain the fertile soil needed to produce steadfastness. And steadfastness—being immovable, unable to be shaken, deeply rooted—is perhaps the true “wellness” we should be seeking. \n\nAs Christians, we eagerly say we want to be like Christ. But many of us are really only asking for the good stuff. “Lord, make us loving and patient and joyful!” we sing in chorus and with enthusiasm. \n\nJesus was indeed all of those things, but He was also described by the prophet Isaiah as “a man of suffering who knew what sickness was” (Isaiah 53:3). Christ Himself learned obedience through His suffering (Hebrews 5:8). And so it is for us. It is from those dark yet fertile valleys that steadfastness begins to spring forth—first sprouting from faith, then budding into love, and flowering into patience and joy.\n\nToday, or tomorrow, or whenever you find yourself in a place of trial—do not minimize it or rush through it. Instead, give thanks to the Lord. Pray for endurance and steadfastness from the One who has already endured and proven Himself steadfast. \n\nAs backwards as it may feel, this difficult trial or painful suffering is a time to thank the Lord. This is the time to rejoice.\n\nWe do not rejoice because bad things happen, or because this poor, fallen world is full of death, injustice, and sorrow. No. We rejoice because the sovereign Lord calls us His own. He loves us enough to descend with us into the dark yet mysteriously fertile valleys, to produce in us a steadfastness which cannot be shaken.\n\nThanks be to God.\n\n“Blessed is the one who endures trials, because when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.” –James 1:12\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: James 1:19-27, Proverbs 10:19, Ephesians 4:26-27, Romans 5:20\n\nI’ve always been a little uncomfortable while getting my hair cut. Perhaps it’s my nervousness that I’ve directed my stylist the wrong way, or that the color we picked won’t work at all with my skin tone. But beyond the anxiety that comes from letting someone else take control for a few hours, there’s a measured amount of discomfort that comes from looking at myself in the mirror for that long. \n\nEvery blemish seems to glow under the lights of my local salon. My eyebrows seem significantly more unruly than I thought they had become, and the makeup I had so carefully applied hours ago has mostly melted away, revealing the oh-so-telling dark circles under my very tired eyes. \n\nAnd yet when I leave, somehow I always feel so much better. I’ve been transformed—or at least my hair has. \n\nIt is transformation and the confidence that comes with it that James is urging us to seek through the reading of the Word. Of course, it’s much less superficial and quite a bit harder than sitting in a salon chair. James tells us that when we hear the Word of God and don’t act, then we are just like a man sitting in front of a mirror, seeing all his blemishes and yet walking away without caring, without doing anything. \n\nIf looking in the mirror is hard, looking deep into the Word of God is harder— especially when reading James’s words. They reflect back to me my own anger, my quickness to speak, my moral failures, my pride. \n\nBut being transformed by the Word means becoming a doer, not just a hearer. It means inviting the Holy Spirit to carve out those ugly places and fill them with the righteousness that Jesus gives, so that I might live out what James calls a “pure and undefiled religion” (1:27). The Word becomes more than a book to me; it is a means of grace, a tool of the Spirit’s sanctifying work in my heart. \n\nJesus said it this way: \n\n“Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.  And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.  And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.  And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.” –Matthew 7:24-27\n\nJesus is the Word made flesh, sent to dwell among us. We are called to look daily not into a mirror, but into the Word—into the very face of Jesus. \n\nThe gospel-filled life Christ calls us to is not one full of quick and angry words, self-serving pride, or self-sufficiency, but of sacrificial love and humility. We are called to let the Word do its work inside us—to read it daily with fresh eyes as it, by the Holy Spirit, reads our hearts and transforms us, making us more and more like Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Vivian Mabuni\n\nScripture Reading: James 2:1-13, Zechariah 7:9-10, Matthew 7:1-5, Romans 13:8-10\n\nWith the precision of a surgeon’s knife, the Holy Spirit sliced into my heart, convicting me. It caught me off guard—my sin of favoritism.\n\nHours before, I’d watched a video on discrimination alongside my ministry team. The clip highlighted how easily we can fall into judging and favoring others. To further illustrate the point, we were divided into two different groups based on one aspect of our lives, something we had no control over: our eye color. People with blue eyes were to be treated differently than those with brown eyes.  \n\nSoon comments and accusations were flying back and forth. The responses of those discriminated against felt strangely satisfying to me. One woman in particular spoke with such disdain; her condescending attitude only proved her lack of awareness of those who live in the margins every day. I confess I was happy to have her sit in the back of the room as a member of the “discriminated” group, so she could experience a lack of equity. \n\nThe next day, our group entered into a time of prayer, confession, and lament. That’s when God opened my eyes in a new way to Galatians chapter five, where Paul lists the works of the flesh: enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy. The very things our team had sought to address and combat head-on were now being revealed in my own heart. I had judged that woman, and in thinking less of her, I showed partiality toward others who appeared more self-aware and further along in their faith journey. \n\n“My brothers and sisters, do not show favoritism as you hold on to the faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ… haven’t you made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?” –James 2:1,4\n\nThis sin—my sin of judging some and favoring others—is cautioned against throughout Scripture. In His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus couldn’t be more clear when He says, “Do not judge, so that you won’t be judged. For you will be judged by the same standard with which you judge others, and you will be measured by the same measure you use” (Matthew 7:1-2).\n\nThe Lord is the only one worthy of being the Judge. He’s the only one capable of judging fairly. “For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7). It’s not our job to do the work of the Holy Spirit in convicting others of their sin, but we are called to respond to the Spirit’s conviction in our own hearts.\n\nWhen we try to take God’s place as judge and jury, perhaps it’s because we’ve lost sight of just how great a debt Jesus died to pay on our behalf. Now, God’s “mercy triumphs over judgment” (James 2:13); His justice has been satisfied once and for all who love Jesus (Romans 3:25-26). \n\nWe’re all on a journey, learning to honor the Lord through loving one another well. Daily, as we walk in step with the Spirit, may we speak the gospel into our waking moments. As sin is exposed, let us draw near to our Savior. Mercy triumphed over judgment when Christ died for us, sinners, and rescued us from deserved condemnation. And mercy triumphs still, as a holy God looks at us and sees the spotless image of His Son.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: James 2:14-26, Deuteronomy 6:4-5, Romans 3:23-26, Ephesians 2:8-10\n\nFor it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n\nI love that Christian freedom is based on this principle: free, radical grace exists for the undeserving through Jesus. There’s nothing we can do to receive it; there’s nothing we can do to reverse it. Incredible, wonderful, scandalous grace.\n\nThat’s why reading James’ words can feel confusing. Is he contradicting grace, saying we’re justified by our works—that without those good works, our faith is as good as dead?\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time grappling with these passages, asking God to open my eyes to what He was saying through these two disciples. On the surface, it seems like they are contradicting one another. Then He reminded me of a breakfast I shared with a friend recently. \n\nI’ve known this friend since I was ten years old. She’s gorgeous, extremely athletic, and was always popular in school. Over the twenty years we’ve known each other, we’ve stayed loosely in touch. Over coffee and eggs, she shared the circumstances of her life—mostly that it hadn’t turned out like she’d planned. \n\nAs we talked, I felt God pressing me to speak. It felt strange, so I hesitated, afraid of sounding cheesy or trite. I knew things between us could get awkward. But then I didn’t really feel like I had a choice. So I said it: \n\n“I don’t know why, but I really feel like God wants me to tell you that He loves you.” \n\nI cringed after saying it, wondering if I’d gone too far. But in that moment, something softened. Tears fell down her cheeks. Rather than turning awkward, the entire moment felt sacred. \n\nHebrews chapter 11 recounts the spiritual giants whose faith in God was counted as righteousness. But that faith wasn’t void of action. A quick perusal of the list and you’ll see it over and over again: verbs.\n\nBy faith Abel offered.\nBy faith Noah built.\nBy faith Abraham obeyed.\n\nOur God is a God of action. So if you have faith in Him, get ready to move. \n\nThis is the beauty of Christianity: our faith in Jesus saves us, and it also frees us from striving to be enough, trying to earn approval, stature, or recognition through what we do. I can do good works without having to worry about measuring the outcome. Faith in Jesus’ final, finished work gives me the security to do good without worrying that I’m doing enough.\n\nThis is where it gets crazy. My friend called me a few weeks later to tell me something had radically changed in her heart. From that moment we shared at the breakfast table, she’d felt God in hot pursuit of her. Since then, she’s been spending every morning in His Word, falling in love with Him again. \n\nIs it possible God can use us like that? Is it possible that I’d just experienced a good work He’d prepared for me in advance, one He’d planned for me to do all along? After all, the work isn’t really mine. I’m just His workmanship (Ephesians 2:10). I’m an instrument in His hands, playing an essential part in His eternal symphony. \n\nWhat a gift. \nTo be saved by grace.\nTo be invited into God’s work.\nTo see that, in the end, it’s all His.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Controlling the Tongue",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: James 3:1-12, Genesis 1:26-27, Psalm 12, Matthew 12:36-37\n\nThe idea of “controlling the tongue” is not just religious-speak to me. It is not just a heading in my Bible or a topic that generates good, honest conversation at a Bible study. It is one of the most sincere prayers of my heart and one of the darkest manifestations of my sin.\n\nEspecially since becoming a mother, I’ve realized my words have the power to give life and hope or to steal them away. I’ll never forget the look in my young daughter’s eyes the first time I tossed sharp, careless words at her like a grenade and saw her wince at the explosion. I surrendered my tongue and its words to the Lord that day, and I’ve surrendered them countless times since.\n\nIn chapter 3, James describes the tongue as the epitome of hypocrisy. “With the tongue we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in God’s likeness” (James 3:9). And here’s the kicker: We are all guilty of this—every one of us, in every phase of life.\n\nJames does not give us a tidy “how-to” at the end of this passage, no foolproof answer for ending this struggle which takes place in each of us. Instead, he provides one analogy after the other, illustrating the way our words can bring life and direction, or death and destruction.\n\n“So too, though the tongue is a small part of the body, it boasts great things. Consider how a small fire sets ablaze a large forest” (v. 5).\n\nOur words have more power than we usually care to acknowledge. If we knew—really knew—the weight our words carry in each person who receives them, how would that change what we say? Would the flames of hypocrisy overcome us if we could see the fires we spark?\n\nThis forthright passage from James should bring us to our knees. Our struggle to control our tongues and rein in our thoughts should cause us to plead to the Father for wisdom in how to honor Him and build up others with our words. This is just what James encourages us to do in the first chapter of his letter: \n\n“Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God—who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly—and it will be given to him” (James 1:5).\n\nPraise God that He hears us! \n\nJust as grace pours into the darkest parts of our hearts, igniting the hope of the gospel, so does His grace pour over the fires we start with our words. The hope of Jesus and the forgiveness of the Father extend to this place, too. As a woman who’s flung more sparks than I care to admit, I am so incredibly thankful.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Wisdom from Above",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: James 3:13-18, Proverbs 11:18, Romans 12:9-21, Galatians 5:22-23, Hebrews 12:11\n\nYou could fill an entire library with all the bad dating advice heard around the world. As early as elementary school, girls are told to change their style or personality to woo a crush. In high school, magazines tell girls to pretend to laugh at his jokes or play hard to get. Even in our twenties, thirties, and beyond, the barrage of bad dating advice from media, friends, and professionals is inescapable. Advice rooted in jealousy, insecurity, and selfishness has engulfed our culture.\n\nWe’ve all sought advice from the world, whether on dating or some other aspect of life. We all face experiences that challenge and confuse us—they’re often the moments that grow us the most. As James says from the very beginning of his book, the trials of life produce maturity (1:2-4). But where we choose to turn with our questions when we’ve lost our way can dramatically change the course of our journey.\n\nAs a counselor, people often turn to me for advice and wisdom while in the throes of crisis. And the truth is, I don’t have all the answers or the perfect advice for every person. Thankfully, my work is more about supporting people along their journey, rather than telling them which steps to take. The desire for clarity isn’t wrong, but there is only one all-knowing and perfect Counselor—and it sure isn’t me.  \n\nWe need to be careful whom we trust to speak into our lives. Hear me on this: it is immeasurably valuable to open your life up to guidance from your trusted church community. But we need to remember that all of us are broken vessels, imperfectly reflecting the image of God. The Lord speaks through people (Matthew 10:20), but we must weigh the words of others with the help of the Holy Spirit to discern what God Himself is saying.\n\nJames does not take the matter of bad advice lightly, going as far as to call it demonic (James 3:15). Why is it such a big deal? Because bad advice can wound people and even destroy lives. There is a sharp distinction between wisdom from above, and wisdom from below. Knowing how serious the consequences can be, we need to be careful with both the counsel we take and the counsel we give. \n\nThankfully, James describes what godly “wisdom from above” looks like. Wisdom from God is “pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering without pretense” (3:17). \n\nInterestingly, those descriptions don’t sound anything like the most “influential” voices in our culture. But is there anyone that does come to mind when you read James’s description of wisdom? Those are the people we ought to turn to for advice, the people we should hope to grow more like over time. \n\nOf course, the life of Christ is the ultimate example of godly wisdom in action. If anyone knows what it is like to face trials, it’s Jesus before the cross. And ultimately who does He seek for comfort and wisdom but His Father? (Luke 22:39-43). This is God’s best for us too.\n\nIn times of crisis and pain, when we’re looking for direction, may our hearts learn to hear the instruction of the Holy Spirit. May we seek first the wisdom of our Heavenly Father. Even now, He longs to be gracious to us, to generously give us wisdom when we ask Him for it (Isaiah 30:18; James 1:5). We’ll know it’s from Him because true wisdom from above carries with it the sweet aroma of gentleness and peace.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: James 4:1-12, Psalm 9:19, John 4:23-24, Galatians 1:10, 1 John 5:13-15\n\nI remember the last time that I humbled myself before the Lord. I didn’t really have a choice. I woke up before the sun, an hour from home, stared at the ceiling, and writhed in the sheets, trying to get out of my own skin. I didn’t want to be me anymore. “Me” had screwed everything up. I wanted to be someone else, or find a way to go back in time and undo all the wrong I had done.\n\nI wanted to start over.\n\nIf I could just go back to the beginning of the year. Or, no, the beginning of last year. Really, if I could go back to before college, that would be best. Or, possibly back to childhood. I was happy then, right? Maybe back then I was okay. I turned to punch my pillow. I know I can never go back far enough. I am who I am. Because of sin, there wasn’t a specific moment in time when things started to wrong. And that is humbling.\n\nI eventually got out of bed and got in my car to drive home. There was an accident on the highway—the kind that makes you put your car in park. I screamed and slammed the steering wheel and didn’t care who saw me in the next lane. The car was pointed home, but I didn’t know where I was going. I just needed to be alone with God and scream at Him and apologize to Him and beg for His forgiveness. Every twenty minutes or so, my mom called to check in on me. She knew I was in a dark night of the soul. “Keep screaming,” she said. “All God requires of us is to acknowledge we have done wrong and turn around.”\n\nThose words had never touched my soul so deeply. \n\nThis is the truth: The world seduces us with its material goods, its experiences, its flushes of beauty and its moments of lust. When we’re proud, we walk along that destructive path, trying to feign confidence. We fill our hands with the world’s pleasures, but like sand, it falls through our fingers. We dig and dig, but in the end, we’re left dirty and empty-handed. All the castles we build are eventually swept away.\n\nHumility is admitting the truth: I have nothing. That’s what I screamed to God in the car. That’s what James wants us to shout to the Lord, too. And thankfully, beautifully, God stands arms open wide, ready for us to turn to Him. He holds our hand when we let go of everything else.\n\nDo you know what’s amazing about this kind of humility? Letting go of the world actually gives us the power—God’s power—and strength to live in this world. It’s a paradox. When we put our entire identity in God, we are no longer slaves to the world’s trends or its approval. We can stand up for justice, at the risk of looking foolish. We can endure ridicule, rather than fight for our reputation. When we have humbled ourselves before God, we don’t need the world’s applause, because our treasure is in heaven.\n\nThank God for humility. And thank God that when we finally, finally, fall to our knees, screaming and ugly-crying before Him, He comes to lift us up.\n\nPunch a pillow today, friend. Tell God the truth about who you are. He already knows. Still He waits for you. He longs to hold you, even though you have nothing but yourself to give.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melissa Zaldivar\n\nScripture Reading: James 4:13-17, Proverbs 27:1, Acts 18:19-21, 1 Corinthians 5:6-8\n\nThe other morning I sat down and thumbed through some old journals from earlier in my 20s. (Incidentally, if you want a good laugh, go back to another season in life and read about what was important to you then.) Sometimes I mentioned an upcoming event or trip or a boy or some kind of debacle that I’d found myself in. But I always had some kind of a plan in motion.\n\nThe trend started early. I once found a to-do list from when I was about eight years old that included “play outside for 1.5 hours.” Because childhood is way more fun when you plan it.\n\nTo this day, my tendency to plan is in full effect. Each and every day starts off with a to-do list of what I want to accomplish. I even add the tasks I’ve already finished, just for the satisfaction of checking them off ‘the list.’ Anyone else?\n\nMy junior year of college, some of my dearest and I planned a retreat to the suburbs of Chicago. As we pulled onto the freeway, I was in the passenger seat in charge of navigation, giving me the much-appreciated perception of control. So you can imagine my surprise when I looked up from my map to see the car in front of us at a full stop—while we cruised along in pace with the rest of the highway. \n\nWhat happened next felt so slow that I can remember every moment, but it was, in reality, mere seconds. Everything became eerily silent. My last thought before impact was, You’re about to be in a car accident. \n\nCome now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will travel to such and such a city and spend a year there and do business and make a profit.” Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring—what your life will be! For you are like vapor that appears for a little while, then vanishes. –James 4:13-14\n\n Nothing prepares you for a crash. For the smell of exhaust. The sound of bending metal and shattering glass. The taste of airbag dust. The shock.\n\nAs things settled, I leaned my shoulder into the car door and stepped out of the wreckage into the stopped, shocked traffic, the Chicago skyline rising up around me. I brushed the airbag dust off of my shirt and cheeks and took a few shaky steps. For months, I would wrestle with the crash in my dreams as I waded through the feeling of helplessness.\n\nIt’s inevitable. We get phone calls or texts or emails that stop us dead in our tracks. The devastating news comes—on-screen, in a letter, or across someone else’s lips. Or maybe, like me, you’ve witnessed or experienced something horrific, something tragic or traumatic. Suddenly, your plans get pushed aside and those to-do lists get burned. You’re left raw and broken, trying to catch your breath.\n\nThat’s the moment when you remember the truth: you’re not the one upholding anything. You remember not to “boast about tomorrow, for you don’t know what a day might bring” (Proverbs 27:1). Christ alone holds all things together (Colossians 1:17).\n\nTomorrow could bring beauty; it could bring heartache. But as I’ve been reminded, even in my darkest moments, Christ holds me fast. Each moment is laced with His grace.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: James 5:1-6, Matthew 5:38-42, Hebrews 10:35-39, Revelation 20:11-15\n\nMy husband and I were on our way to a dinner party, when we cut through a neighborhood on the nice side of town. As we drove the luxurious streets, we stared out our windows at the soaring homes with custom architecture and perfectly manicured lawns. Each house looked like the perfect place to live, its own little heaven on earth. We drove in silence, until my husband turned to me and laughingly apologized, “I’m sorry I’m a pastor.”\n\nThis is a running joke between us, though I can’t help but detect a hint of truth in his voice. We have every single thing we need, and more, but that doesn’t stop comparison from knocking on our door. On more days than I care to admit, I peek over the fence into my neighbor’s greener pasture, and I yearn for it. \n\nDeep down, my husband and I both know that “more” will never scratch the itch of envy. More money, more house, more things will not relieve the pain—and the lie—of comparison. It’s a bottomless pit of need, with endless demands which are never satisfied. We know this, but we also need reminding. \n\nThis is the gift of James 5, which reminds us what is true about all our pretty possessions. Preached with the same fire-bellied conviction as the Old Testament prophets, James has harsh words for wealthy people who misuse their riches. According to New Testament scholar Douglas Moo, James is not targeting all wealthy people, but those who put their wealth to unrighteous ends. Or, those who are simply stingy with it. For those believers, James reserves his harshest judgments.\n\nHowever, James has a more universal message too. Whether we have wealth or we don’t, whether we misuse our money or we don’t, our possessions amount to very little. Drawing on earlier biblical imagery of moth and rust (Matthew 6:19), James reminds us that even our finest earthly possessions will one day be gone. Their Kingdom weight is slight. Their investment yields even less. Money and possessions cannot, and will not, give us what we want. \n\nSo, how do we escape the wretched emptiness this passage describes? \n\nFirst, feed on God, not things. Our pursuit of possessions is a lot like trying to satisfy deep hunger by eating a single lettuce leaf. It will not fill us. Our appetites can only be satisfied by the “bread of life,” Jesus Christ, who promises, “No one who comes to me will ever be hungry, and no one who believes in me will ever be thirsty again” (John 6:35).\n\nSecond, be generous. Too often, we resolve not to love our possessions too much, a mindset that is well-intentioned but without accountability or discernibility. The world will only know we hold our possessions loosely if we actually hold them loosely. This is why Jesus exhorts us to radical acts of generosity (Matthew 5:40-42). Jesus commands this, not simply because it’s a “nice thing to do,” but because it sets our hearts—and, therefore, our feet—on a different path, away from the destruction James describes. \n\nThese are truths we must speak over ourselves again and again. The sparkle and shine of worldly goods are a powerful illusion, but the more we return to these biblical truths, the more they will start to sink in. \n\nNow, whenever my husband apologizes for what we cannot afford, I turn to him and smile to say, “You know what, they don’t have anything we don’t already have in Christ.” \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: James 5:7-20, Joel 2:23, Matthew 5:33-37, Hebrews 11:32-40, 1 Peter 4:7-11\n\nWhen I see the word “patience” listed in Galatians 5, along with the other fruit of the Spirit, I groan. I’m reading happily along with love, joy, and peace, and then… patience. Ugh.\n\nI know I’m not patient. Watch me try to fold a fitted sheet. But patience, as talked about in the Bible, is much more than remaining calm in the midst of fitted-sheet frustration.\n\nTake the new believers in the book of James as an example. These people were Jews recently converted to Christianity. Because of their new beliefs, they were rejected by their own people. They were persecuted by everyone around them, and James tells them to do what? \n\n“You also must be patient.” –James 5:8\n\nThe Greek word often used for patience in Scripture is makrothumeo, which means… well, it means words that make me uncomfortable, such as:\n\nLongsuffering\nSlowness in avenging wrongs\nSteadfastness\nForbearance.\n\nPatience is much deeper than something you practice when someone is hogging the bathroom. Patience—the longsuffering kind of patience—is something that arises when real trial strikes.\n\nA few months ago, my own longsuffering was tested. I wish I could tell you I turned to God, fully trusting Him during this dark time, but no. Instead, I shook my fist, and I shook it hard. I was angry at God, and I tried desperately to escape the anxiety and darkness by my own means.\n\nYou could say I was the opposite of longsuffering. I was short-suffering, tiny-suffering, microscopic-suffering. I realized in those few months that my pain threshold is nearly nonexistent and, even still, I know most of you reading this have weathered much worse. My life was not bearing the fruit of patience because somewhere deep down inside of me I didn’t trust my God. And somewhere even deeper inside of me, I had lost hope and convinced myself I was alone.\n\nBut there’s an amazing thing about the word longsuffering in the New Testament: it is almost always an instruction given in the context of hope.\n\nRomans 8 says, “For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together with labor pains until now. . . We ourselves who have the Spirit as the firstfruits—we also groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies” (vv. 22-23).\n\nAnd in Galatians 6:9, we’re told, “So we must not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don’t give up.”\n\nWe groan. But we don’t give up. Better still, we do not wait without hope! \n\nWe do not wait in vain. We wait for our God—the God who has promised and secured our full redemption through Jesus Christ.\n\nMay we do the same for each other in the face of our trials. Let’s practice longsuffering together. Let’s look at our lives with an eye to that glorious day in the future when suffering is but a long, forgotten memory of this earth.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nI have sepia-toned memories of wearing a pillowcase veil, grabbing a handful of dandelions, and marching my scrawny, little-girl legs down a grassy aisle, pretending to be a bride. To six-year-old me, the wait for my real wedding seemed impossibly long, but that didn’t stop me from actively hoping the day would eventually come. Nearly forty years of hindsight reveals that the gap between the hope and the reality was itty bitty. All too soon, I’d traded in cotton for tulle and weeds for roses in the blink of an eye.\n\nSo it is with the promises of Christ. Here, in the first chapter of 1 Peter, the apostle reminds us of our “living hope” (v.3). He doesn’t leave us guessing about what we’re hoping for. Through the resurrection of Christ, we have gained: rebirth and a salvation ready to be revealed, as well as an imperishable, undefiled, unfading inheritance (vv.3–5).\n\nLike a little girl trying to picture her future groom, these promises can look a little fuzzy around the edges. Yes, Christ has saved us, and He is changing us even now, but so much of our hope is in what’s been stored up for us in the future, or as Peter reminds us, what’s being “kept in heaven” for us (v.4).\n\nWe have a storehouse of hope. It is the ultimate trust fund, a hope chest full of the promises of God. While we have yet to see our God face to face, we’ve been given the gift of faith to believe in Him, know Him, and love Him now. And we “rejoice with inexpressible and glorious joy,” because even as we await His return, we are receiving the goal of [our] faith, the salvation of [our] souls” (vv.8–9).\n\nOurs is a living and active hope in a living and active God, who has unfathomable blessings in store for His bride. And yet, there are days, lots of them, when our living hope seems to be doing little more than gathering dust. Peter alluded to this early on. We are the “chosen, living as exiles” (v.1). We are chosen, yet sometimes unpopular in this world, never quite at home here. Sometimes our very cells seem to groan for more.\n\nWhen will we know what it’s like to be made new, fully shedding the broken version of ourselves? How long until the Lord shows His hand, demystifying the “salvation ready to be revealed in the last time”? (v.5). How much longer until we can open the hope chest to touch and feel our imperishable inheritance?\n\nIt will happen in the blink of an eye.\n\nYou are being guarded by God’s power through faith for salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. You rejoice in this, even though now for a short time, if necessary, you suffer grief in various trials (vv.5–6).\n\nThe gap between this present moment and future glory may seem impossibly large. Still we rejoice. Because we have a hope kept in heaven that can never be destroyed. One day we will trade in the suffering of these “various trials” for the many gifts God has tucked away for us.\n\nIt won’t be long now.\n\nThat is why, among the people of God, hope will always be alive and well.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nThe list of things I know for certain is short, but I know this: I am not holy.\n\nI hear Peter’s charge to “be holy in all your conduct” (1 Peter 1:15) as he echoes the Lord’s words to “be holy, because I am holy” (Leviticus 11:44), and I feel the gravitational pull of defeat. Because it doesn’t seem to matter how much I want to be holy. (And trust me—I really, really want to be holy). There aren’t twelve steps I can take to become holy. There aren’t bootstraps big enough to pull me up toward the perfection of God. There’s no self-help guide to blamelessness. If personal holiness is up to me, it begins to feel like an impossible equation.\n\nThere are times when I get fed up with chronically missing the mark. I want to be holy because God is holy, but instead find myself broken because the world is broken. I was having one of these fed-up moments while driving down the highway recently. In my frustration I cried out to the Lord, praying, “How long, Lord, until I become like you?!”\n\nThis phrase came to mind; “In a moment.”\n\nFor a nanosecond I worried I was about to hit a semi head on, because I know I will not fully become like Christ this side of heaven. But no collision came. My heart was simply recalling the gospel hope I cling to. Scripture tells us that when Christ returns, we will be changed “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye” (1 Corinthians 15:52).\n\nPeter isn’t tasking us with a moral standard our broken selves can never attain. He’s preaching the gospel. We can’t hear it too often. He reminds us of what’s truest about us as Christ-followers:\n\nFor you know that you were redeemed from your empty way of life inherited from your fathers, not with perishable things like silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb (1 Peter 1:18–19).\n\nYes, I am broken as my parents were broken.\nMy children are broken, as I am broken.\nYou are broken, as all people are broken.\nBut that is not our story, and it’s not our identity.\n\nOur brokenness and Christ’s holiness are two sides of the same gospel coin. And so we need to stop staring at our failed attempts at holiness. We need to flip the coin over, and instead gaze with wonder anew at the gospel of grace. Again, we cannot do it too often.\n\nMy power over sin rests not in me, but in the one who burst forth from the grave (v.21), the “holy, holy, holy” One (Revelation 4:8). I am holy, because Christ is holy, and I am hidden in Him (Colossians 3:3). Yes, my flesh is broken. But praise be to God, “All flesh is like grass and its glory like the flower of grass” (1 Peter 1:24).\n\nBut the holiness of God is mine forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nHaley and I sat down at a picnic table. Her four young children ran to the playground.\n\n“So what do you want to know?” she asked. I took in a deep breath and looked at my notes. Where to begin?\n\nEarlier that year, I’d begun interviewing female veterans as research for a novel. Tall and blonde with striking blue eyes, Haley was dressed in casual jeans and a tee-shirt. You would never guess that just a few years ago, she had been deployed to Afghanistan, leading an engineering platoon.\n\nWhile they were deployed, she told me, her platoon built outposts for incoming NATO troops. Every few weeks, she and a group of 20 soldiers would travel to a remote location in the desert, where they’d construct wood platforms, assemble huge Army-green tents, and dig a trench as a temporary latrine. While they worked, an infantry unit provided security around the perimeter. They had to build quickly; the opposition was everywhere.\n\nThe image of Haley holding a hammer in the middle of enemy territory comes to mind as I read today’s passage. After all, Jesus calls us to begin constructing the kingdom of God here on earth—even though we will face resistance.\n\nPeter wrote his letters to a specific population of Christians who lived just before Roman Emperor Nero’s brutal persecution of the church, which began in 64 A.D. At the time, Christians experienced slander, ridicule, and discrimination from their neighbors. They were facing opposition on all sides, and Peter knew that the pressure was only going to get worse.\n\nBut in the midst of a dire situation, there was hope. Peter leans on a construction metaphor, explaining that they were being built up, like “living stones” into a spiritual house (v.5). And the resistance? The rejection? The reviling? None of that would come as a surprise to Jesus. He warned His followers that they would face persecution, opposition, and even open hatred (John 16:33). He knew they would face these things, because when you build a new kingdom in the middle of enemy territory, the enemy takes aim.\n\nAt the heart of this passage is a call to keep building—even if we’re afraid, even if it’s hard. (Perhaps especially if it’s hard.) I am a builder in the midst of enemy territory. So are you. There might be differences among us—race, age, nationality, background—and yet, our shared identity as Christ-followers gives us the freedom to stand side-by-side, raising our hammers together, participating in the construction of the kingdom of God.\n\nWhen the hammer gets heavy, 1 Peter 2:10 stands as a reminder: “Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people; you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.” And Jesus? He is our cornerstone, the first piece of the foundation and the rock upon which the whole structure rests. Without Him, it would all fall apart.\n\nKeep building the spiritual house in the midst of this world. Do not grow weary. It may seem futile at times, but all our building is not in vain. With Jesus as our cornerstone, we are the beginnings of a city that will endure forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nInjustice of any kind is hard to bear. When I’m on the receiving end of hate, my natural inclination is to defend myself. To fight back. I have little strength to shoulder the weight of false accusations, unfair treatment, or slights on my character. And yet, that’s exactly what the passage in 1 Peter 2 is asking me to do: put down my rights and “submit to every human institution” (v.13).\n\nBefore we continue, it’s important to address the part of this passage that tells slaves to submit to their masters. The Greek word used here refers to household or domestic servants who would’ve also been slaves. Slavery in the first century was different than the American version of race-based slavery of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Peter is not advocating for slavery as a system. He is instead dealing with it as a reality that some of the recipients of his letter lived under. For our purposes, it’s best to read this passage with the phrase “lowly workers” in mind. Peter was instructing Christians to endure their pain with grace.\n\nPeter would know. On more than one occasion, an oppressive government imprisoned him for his beliefs and preaching. He would eventually be crucified. In that place of oppression, he continued preaching the gospel, trusting that God would use every ounce of his suffering for the good of the world. He submitted to the path that God had paved for him, even though that path included hardship.\n\nIf you cringe at the word “submission,” you’re in good company. Submission is extremely counter-cultural in our “YOLO” society. An acronym short for you only live once, YOLO is a rallying cry that places happiness as the ultimate aim of life. If we only have this one life to live, we might as well make it a great, fun, exciting one, right? I have to admit, it’s a pretty attractive philosophy. But it stands at complete odds with Christianity.\n\nWe also live in a society that rails against injustice with ever-increasing outrage. Police brutality, racial bias in our judicial system, gender wage gaps, sexual abuse and harassment in the workplace—these are serious problems, constantly dominating my news feeds. But the problem with focusing all of my attention and outrage on the world’s ills is that I can so easily lose sight of my own sin. I begin to want change out there far more than I desire change in my own heart.\n\nRather than focus his eyes on the injustice leveraged against him, Peter chose to focus on the injustices he’d perpetrated against God, forgiven by Jesus’s blood. He knew the truth: Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection replaces our temporary perspective with an eternal one.\n\nHe himself bore our sins in his body on the tree; so that, having died to sins, we might live for righteousness (1 Peter 2:24).\n\nAs a Christ-follower, you’re not only going to live once—you’re going to live forever. Discomfort, pain, and injustice are real, but they are fleeting when compared to the glory and love of our Savior. I’d rather serve Jesus than my own happiness. And I can trust Jesus to use the injustices I see around me for the good of His kingdom.\n\nHow do I know this? Because He suffered a sham trial, a wrongful conviction, and bloody death—on my behalf. And thank God He did. Jesus transformed the ultimate injustice into the world’s greatest good.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nJust before Thanksgiving, Patrick asked my father for his blessing to propose. An Army Colonel who’d spent nearly 30 years serving in the U.S. Military, my father has all the outward trappings of intimidation. Patrick braced for the third degree. Instead, my father laughed, shrugged, and smiled.\n\n“You’re both smart,” he said. “If Claire wants to marry you, then you have my blessing.” Before Patrick could breathe easy, my father put up one finger as if he’d just remembered something important.\n\n“You know, Claire has a tendency to want to take charge,” he said.\n\nWay to go dad. I can’t blame him for saying that—it’s true. I do have a tendency to want to take charge. For that reason, reading this passage is difficult. It’s easy to read verses about how God loves me. It’s hard to read about what God expects of me. But deep down I know the passages of Scripture that make me most uncomfortable are likely the passages I need to engage with the most.\n\nWhen I read this passage the first time, all I could think about were women who’ve been mistreated, oppressed, and abused by men who have used these Scriptures to justify their abhorrent behavior. But Peter isn’t writing this passage for society at large. He’s telling individual women to submit to their own husbands, not for all women everywhere to be subordinate to men in general.\n\nIf my father’s first warning weren’t enough, nine years of marriage have likely taught my husband that my ability to submit isn’t my best quality. Whenever there’s a decision to be made, my knee-jerk reaction is to grab the reins—not out of kindness, but out of pride and fear. My desire for control is more powerful than my desire for deeper marital connection. All the while, the world tells me that I can be superwoman, have it all, remain young-looking, and raise a family. Soon, my hands are full of reins, but my heart is empty of peace. God invites me into a new way of living. The new way is slower, quieter. Because God loves me, I can trust that obeying His guidance won’t lead to more harm but, ultimately, to His blessing.\n\nAt the end of the previous chapter, Peter outlined Jesus’s suffering and sacrifice on the cross. He begins this chapter with these words: “In the same way, wives submit yourselves to your own husbands” (v.1). Peter then calls husbands to do the same, especially taking in to account the societal norms of the day, which saw women as “weaker” and less than their male counterparts. He instructs:\n\nIn the same way, you husbands must give honor to your wives. Treat your wife with understanding as you live together. She may be weaker than you are, but she is your equal partner in God’s gift of new life (v.7).\n\nJesus gave us a model for sacrificial love. And if we’re following His model, we cannot be surprised when loving well is sometimes hard and messy; it may cost us something in return. Jesus put down His rights in order to grant us access to the kingdom of God. In the same way, we’re called to put down our own need for control, trusting His ways are best.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nThe year was 1967. Crowds had gathered outside the Pentagon to protest the ongoing Vietnam War. Members of the 503rd Military Police Battalion formed a semi-circle and pointed their rifles toward the protestors. It was a tense moment, in a tense era, in a tense world.\n\nBut then hope seemed to break right through the moment, as a young man stepped forward to place carnations inside the officers’ barrels. American photographer, Bernie Boston, captured the moment in a shot entitled, “Flower Power.” The photograph moved the nation so profoundly, it earned Boston a nomination for the Pulitzer Prize, and the ethos of an entire generation was captured and preserved.\n\nWhatever your political beliefs, as Christ’s followers, we’ve been given clear marching orders to protest the evil so prevalent in our world. We don’t fight with rebel fists, clenched in rage. Our assignment is to do good, to combat evil with righteousness, darkness with light, lies with truth, hatred with love.\n\nThough it sounds warm and fuzzy, we cannot expect the world to respond to us with heart eyes. Jesus Himself warned us that they would instead take up arms against us.\n\n“If the world hates you, understand that it hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own. However, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of it, the world hates you” (John 15:18–19).\n\nThis battle is not new. There is no bait and switch. Jesus is clear: we will offer love and receive something else in return. Our good deeds may fall on deaf ears, or worse, turn others against us. Knowing this to be true from his own experience, Peter sought to encourage believers who faced suffering for the sake of the gospel. He told them, “It is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil” (1 Peter 3:17).\n\nBecause of Christ, we are free to face such reactions from the world without the element of surprise. As in all things, Christ goes before us. He absorbed insults for His wisdom, betrayal for His faithfulness, and lashings for His love. Because of Him, we can bless when we are cursed, do good when others seek to harm us, and love when we are hated. We stand ready with hope, in a dark world that needs hope so desperately.\n\nMay we follow the example of our humble Savior, Church. May our hope in Jesus prepare our hearts for the battles we may face because of our love for Him. Let the world hurl their worst in our direction. Because of Jesus, we stand ready, eager to see hope break through.\n\nBut in your hearts regard Christ the Lord as holy, ready at any time to give a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you. Yet do this with gentleness and respect (1 Peter 3:15–16).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nI’m a big fan of the bottom line. Get me to the point, and fast. Perhaps that’s why I love this gem, found near the middle of the book of 1 Peter: “Above all, maintain constant love for one another, since love covers a multitude of sins” (4:8).\n\nThis is the axis upon which the book of 1 Peter pivots. If we take a zoomed out approach, we see Peter tackling all manner of tough topics in this little letter. From holiness, to submission, to suffering, to leadership—Peter went for the jugular in his appeal to the Church. But all of it rises and falls and culminates with love.\n\nBecause what is “holiness,” divorced from a love for God? It’s rule-following at best, and legalism at its worst. What is submission apart from love? Manipulation? Fear? The ugly counterpart to dominance? Who wants a loveless marriage or cold-hearted shepherd? Not me. Not you, I’m sure.\n\nLove is the linchpin that holds us all together. That’s why Peter reminds us that as Christ’s followers, love is what we are to strive for “above all.” But look again. This is not just is not the run-of-the-mill love we have for our favorite brand of ice cream. It’s not even the kind of deep love we feel for the people who mean the most to us. This love, “covers a multitude of sins” and shortcomings and heartache. Peter is reminding the Church of the first century to mirror Christ’s love, demonstrated most profoundly by His sacrifice on the cross. In Christ, we are a new creation, and as such, we ought to seek to live like one—free from the bondage of sin and shame.\n\nFor we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be rendered powerless so that we may no longer be enslaved to sin, since a person who has died is freed from sin (Romans 6:6–7).\n\nThe center of Peter’s letter—of the entirety of God’s Word, really—and of our faith is this gospel truth. Christ’s abundant love, manifested in His sacrifical life, death, and resurrection, covered my sins. It covered yours. This is the gospel, in its boiled down, beautifully simple form. Love is the bottom line.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nThese days, there’s a pair of boxing gloves resting on the passenger’s seat of my car, and it makes me entirely giddy. While I’m certain I’m also improving my self defense skills and I hope to intimidate all those around me at the sight of my gloves, that’s not why I have them at all. I recently joined a boxing gym with one of my coworkers. It’s something I never thought I’d do for a million reasons, and exactly why I love it so much.\n\nYou see, the past year I’ve battled opponents like chronic pain, fatigue, and depression, which wiped me out and put me on the sidelines for weeks-turned-months on end. I am still far from winning these matches, but I’m thankful that some of the very worst parts have lifted, leaving a little space for hopeful and fun activities like exercise—things I had missed immensely. So I guess you could say my jab-jab-cross-uppercut enthusiasm is fueled by gratefulness for my newfound health and the growing distance between me and long, sleepless nights. I am doing this for my former self who couldn’t.\n\nSuffering can feel like a tough blow to the head or a punch right in the stomach, but Jesus has already fought for us and given us strength we could never muster for ourselves. And now, we suffer differently, for our former selves who couldn’t survive sin at all. Instead of backing down to pain, we rejoice when His glory is revealed, and even we “are ridiculed for the name of Christ, [we] are blessed” (1 Peter 4:13–14). We do not suffer in the same way others do because we know exactly how the battle ends.\n\nOne of the first things I learned in boxing was how to wrap my hands before putting them inside the gloves. Using a cloth bandage, I begin by wrapping my wrists, then criss-cross around my hand, covering each knuckle and protecting each finger. And because I do this, I know I’ll be safe, no matter how hard I hit the punching bag.\n\nWhen we face hard times as children of God, we are given something to wrap around our hearts for protection: the truth of who He is. We cover our minds in Scripture, trusting that no matter what we face, we do not face it without our Father, who wears a belt of righteousness and a sash of faithfulness (Isaiah 11:5).\n\nWith these words, He makes sure all our doubts are answered and all our fears are covered by His love for us. So when we step into the ring of discomfort, we already know the outcome; we are called blessed by the Lord, our God. Thanks be to Him.\n\n“Blessed are the poor in spirit,\nfor the kingdom of heaven is theirs.\nBlessed are those who mourn,\nfor they will be comforted.\nBlessed are the humble,\nfor they will inherit the earth.\nBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,\nfor they will be filled.” –Matthew 5:3–6\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nI’m a girl very much in love with creature comforts like yoga pants, guacamole, and on-demand TV. I’d rather not be uncomfortable, much less suffer. I mean, I’m not alone in this, right? While we may not suffer isolation or oppression like the readers of Peter’s letter, we all have places of hardship and difficulty.\n\nYes, despite my affection for stretchy pants and binge-worthy programming, life for me has sticky places. Places that reveal my selfish heart and prickly pride. I have relationships that are tense and less than loving. There are situations that bring me a ton of stress and, to a mild degree, “suffering.” But tucked here in 1 Peter 5 is a tiny, often overlooked admonition that might help soften the blow of those situations.\n\nPeter is encouraging church leaders, called elders, to shepherd and serve the people of God well. Why would Peter interrupt his commentary on suffering and Christian living in an ungodly culture to talk to church leadership? It seems Peter knew that their wise counsel and tender care would be critical in helping God’s people persevere.\n\nBut I wonder if Peter was also speaking to this group of men because he knew they would experience their own unique brand of suffering because of their call to shepherd God’s flock? Are we surprised? Living in relationship with Christ-followers is hard and messy because living in any relationship is hard and messy. We sometimes glamorize or expect more from our brothers and sisters in Christ, but friend, though Jesus is King of my heart, I can still be super selfish, prideful, and easily frustrated. How about you?\n\nI don’t want to cause anyone undue suffering, especially not someone who is sacrificially serving the body of Christ. Our leaders are called, and I think equipped, to demonstrate grace and humility toward the people of God. But look at what Peter says to you and me: “All of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another” (1 Peter 5:5). We can all partner together to make the work of living together as Christ-followers a bit easier by putting on humility.\n\nWhen we choose to believe the best about the girl whose short reply kind of hurt our feelings, we put on humility. When we extend grace to the friend who blew us off (again), we put on humility. When we focus on our leaders’ strengths rather than berating them for their weaknesses, we put on humility. When we gladly serve, even as others do less than their fair share, we put on humility.\n\nThis call rings loudly within the context of Christian community, but think about the places in your life where you are currently suffering. Could Peter’s charge to be clothed with humility let you stretch in grace, persevere in patience, or extend forgiveness? Perhaps none of our hard places will feel as comfortable as our yoga pants, but might humility be the thing that makes us more comfortable in those less than comfortable circumstances?\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nIn this world, we are going to suffer. It’s true. That’s what Peter is saying at the end of his letter. There are spiritual things going on in this world that he wants us to remember. First, we have an enemy, and a very real one at that. And his most successful tactical move toward defeating us is perhaps our own tendency toward distraction. We’d much rather look for ways to explain our pain and suffering, or find ways to numb or ignore it—anything but lean into it.\n\nThe world is blind to the schemes of the enemy, who has also blinded their eyes to the light of the gospel (2 Corinthians 4:4–6). This is why Peter is pleading with Christ-followers to “be sober-minded, be alert.” Because our “adversary the devil is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for anyone he can devour” (1 Peter 5:8).\n\nNow, I can assure you that when facing down a lion, real or hypothetical, my first instinct will always be to flee, not stand and fight. And this lion Peter is warning us about is very real, indeed—whether we’re aware of him or not—and he is always stalking us, circling, looking for a weakness to exploit. Therefore, we are to “resist him,” standing “firm in the faith, knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced by [our] fellow believers throughout the world” (v.9). We must be awake to his schemes.\n\nSuffering throughout a fallen world? The enemy would far rather we continue to be surprised by it, especially if, in the midst of our pain, we begin to doubt the goodness of our God. And so we must remember that our personal pain and suffering this side of heaven are not the exception (1 Peter 4:12). Nor are our struggles really with one another; they are with evil itself (Ephesians 6:12).\n\nThis enemy will use every weapon in his arsenal to abuse us and tear us away from the path God has called us to. He wants to keep us from maturing in the faith, and he most definitely does not want us to become who God created us to be: devoted lovers of God, who display His love and splendor to the world. Our enemy wants to wound us and will stop at nothing to do it.\n\nBut here’s the most important thing to remember: Jesus Christ defeated death and evil itself (John 16:33), and if we are in Him, we’ve conquered them too—the enemy cannot harm us (1 John 5:4, 18–19). We belong to a loving, all-powerful God, who does not abuse us through suffering. Instead, He draws us closer to Him, healing and transforming us through our pain—not in spite of it. Because of this, we will never be crushed under the weight of persecution or affliction. This suffering is only temporary, but our salvation is secure, our relationship with our Creator everlasting (2 Corinthians 4:7–9, 16–18). And after we have suffered a little while, God Himself will restore us and make us strong, firm and steadfast (1 Peter 5:10). \n\nThanks be to our God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nAt first, Peter just doesn’t get it. After all, he’s the guy who cut off a guard’s ear in the garden and denied Christ three times before His crucifixion. Peter was quick to speak, but understanding took years. The mystery of the Messiah was a true mystery to him. He didn’t fully understand Christ’s purpose, or how He was truly God.\n\nBut in this letter, it’s clear Peter finally understands. Here he makes one of the clearest declarations of Christ’s divinity found in the New Testament, calling Him “our God and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 1:1). After Christ’s death and resurrection, Peter finally grasps who Christ really is.\n\nWinston Churchill once quipped, “Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing has happened.” Ah, Winston, how do you know us so well? When we see the truth of Christ as Messiah and Savior, it’s sure easier to dust ourselves off and hurry on like we never caught a glimpse of the truth. The truth was hard for Peter, and it’s still hard for us to understand today.\n\nBut truth of this saving knowledge of Jesus is central to Peter’s letter. So what does he mean by “the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord”? (v.2). This knowledge is supposed to multiply grace and peace to us. Saving knowledge of God leads us to grow in our faith. God’s grace is the source of all godly living, thus God’s grace results in godliness.\n\nPeter’s list of godly qualities does not detail the prerequisites for salvation, but the natural outpouring of a heart that seeks knowledge of God. It’s possible to be Christians and still be “ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord” if we aren’t increasing in the qualities of godliness (v.8, ESV). Even with the saving knowledge of Christ, we still need His grace. That’s why Peter prays, “May grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord” (v.2).\n\nThen Peter enjoins believers to “make every effort to confirm your calling and election, because if you do these things you will never stumble” (v.10). This is the proper activity of the Christian life. We are to know Christ, and by knowing Him, to grow in Him and abide in Him.\n\nSeek Christ. Don’t squander His grace. All who abide in Him will bear fruit. If your faith is not bearing fruit, something is wrong. Many have deceived themselves, thinking their faith was genuine. Others have stunted their own growth in the faith by negligence and sloth. The answer to either peril is the same: run to Christ, whose “divine power has given us everything required for life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness” (v.3).\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI’m so pregnant right now. I’m past taking chipper walks and decorating my nursery. I’m at the stage where I can’t sleep anymore, so I just cry while I watch reruns of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. I love being pregnant, and I was such a good soldier for so long. But there’s something about the difficulty of the last few weeks of pregnancy that primes and steels a woman for the intensity of labor and delivery. It makes us ready and willing to undergo any hardship just to be delivered from the close quarters of late pregnancy. That, and I’m tired of performing a trust fall every time I try to sit in a chair.\n\nI love having babies. But when pregnancy gets hard, I have to remember the end goal—the baby! Somehow in the muddle of pregnancy and labor I forget all about the baby and focus on my heartburn and my contractions. I literally forget about the baby. This is true for so many things; when times get dark, it can be easy to forget the one, most important thing and instead get caught up in all the peripheral ephemera. But when it’s dark, we need the lamp of truth to lead us home.\n\nGod’s Word is that lamp shining in a dark place. His Word was delivered by prophets and then confirmed in the person of Jesus Christ. He inspires and fortifies our faith by the eyewitness accounts that again and again confirm what the prophets spoke and wrote.\n\nPeter was one such eyewitness, a man who stood on the mount of transfiguration and heard the voice of God. I can’t even imagine. Somehow Peter managed to pry himself off the ground and listen to the words God spoke: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased!” (2 Peter 1:17). God is constantly bringing us the light of His Word to illuminate our confusion.\n\nDon’t allow yourself to be confused or distracted. We do not hold to a cleverly devised myth, but to Truth itself. Christ came in space and time, walked before eyewitnesses who beheld “his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). We have the witness of the Word, strongly confirmed in history, bearing witness to Christ, our Light and Life (2 Peter 1:19).\n\nWe must hold tight to the things that are true. We know that Jesus is God’s son (Matthew 17:5). We know that He came to save us (Romans 6:23). And we know that His Word is a light in the darkness (2 Peter 1:19).\n\nToday, even though I have both heartburn AND contractions, I am looking forward to holding my baby. Instead of letting ourselves get caught up in the passing peripherals, we must remember that Christ is the one important thing, and we have the truths of God’s Word to hold us steady when the rush and press of life threatens to tip us over.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nIn high school, we learned the basic structure of a great story: conflict, climax, and resolution. You start with conflict; the obstacle in the story that the main character must overcome. Then you need a climax; the dramatic turning point where the battle is faced head-on. And finally, you give the reader resolution; the conflict is defeated, and the story concludes. You’ll notice most of our beloved books and movies follow this format.\n\nI’m sure I don’t need to tell you that life doesn’t usually play out like a movie. There’s not always a simple three-part storyline. And sadly, there is sometimes no obvious resolution to our problems.\n\nOur reading from Peter’s second letter addresses the resolution coming for false teachers. Peter calls out religious teachers profiting from a blasphemous version of the gospel. Make no mistake, Peter saw this as a serious offense. Yet, while their sin was worthy of death, many of the false teachers seemed to keep prospering in their work.\n\nPeter’s letter to believers essentially says, “You may not see the resolution right now, but let me tell you how this story is going to end.” Peter declares that God is for the good of His people, and the Lord will fiercely defend His children from evil. Peter reminds us that God fights for His people. He’s not some fairy godmother who shows up to grant our wishes. Peter recalls how the Lord destroyed whole cities and even sent a flood because of His wrath and judgment against wrongdoing.\n\nSometimes we squirm a bit when we hear about God’s wrath. We might feel more comfortable with depictions of the sacrificial Lamb or the overflowing Spirit. But when we cut out the God of justice, we miss out on a vital part of the Lord’s heart. Perhaps we squirm because we know deep down we deserve wrath too. But the greatest story of all time shows we have nothing to fear.\n\nThe story of Jesus started in the garden, where the great conflict of sin entered stage left. From that time on, men and women tried to overcome their flaws and put the world back together with little success. It’s not until Jesus took center stage, bearing the weight of the world’s sin on the cross, that we reached the true climax of the story. Because the Lord knows how to rescue us (2 Peter 2:9), He knew how death needed to be defeated. Christ was raised victorious, and all who call on His name will enter the kingdom of heaven with Him. When you’re in the midst of a struggle with no resolution in sight, remember how this grand story ends.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nYou know when you make a big deal out of something pretty insignificant? Maybe your day didn’t start on the right foot, and you just hit a tipping point. Now you’ve completely lost perspective on the matter at hand and can’t seem to right your focus. Does this ever happen to you?\n\nIt’s easy to get caught up in the struggles of the daily grind. While we believe the very breath in our lungs is a gift from God, we lose our grasp on the miracle of life when the kids are fighting, a stressful project is due, or a relationship goes awry. It’s natural to focus on the things in our lives that need attention, but how can we do that without losing sight of the bigger picture?\n\nIn Peter’s second letter, he reminds believers not to lose sight of the greater story. For Peter, one of the most encouraging things to remember in times of trials was the coming Day of the Lord. So often, we focus on the death and resurrection of Christ but forget His promise to return. When we do, we lose sight of where our lives are headed.\n\nPeter even said that there will be false teachers who question God’s timing and try to convince believers that Christ isn’t coming back. But our hope rests in the trustworthy promises of the Lord. And because Christ said He’ll return like “a thief in the night,” we need to be prepared for His arrival at any moment (1 Thessalonians 5:2).\n\nWhat does it look like to be prepared? It’s not about storing up good deeds, because nothing we ever do will be perfect enough to deserve heaven. All we need to do is place our trust in Jesus, our Savior. He stands in the gap and covers all our sin. “Based on his promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness dwells” (2 Peter 3:13). These promises rest not on our merit, but on His.\n\nIn knowing that Christ will come back at any moment, the stressors of our lives seem less significant. In the new heavens and new earth, a bad grade on a test or an embarrassing moment won’t mean a thing. In fact, “Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away” (Revelation 21:4). We will be with the one who created us, the one who fulfills our every need. In the midst of the messy and mundane, let’s refocus our eyes upward as we wait expectantly for the coming of the Lord.\n\n \n\n",

(Yes, I am aware of those four little words—“do not consume raw”—on the package that would say otherwise.) I don’t know if it’s the taste of sheer rebellion or the perfectly gooey texture, but regardless, I am never totally convinced that sacrificing the delicious and immediate taste of cookie dough is worth the patience and distress of waiting for the dough to actually become warm cookies.\n\nPerhaps the English proverb “Have your cake and eat it too” should apply to any type of baked good. We want to experience the good thing that’s available now and still have the good thing to come later. Thankfully, Peter’s letters don’t ask us to make that choice. Unlike the cookie dough warnings, Peter encourages us to savor our relationship with God both now and forever, because that’s how much time we’ve been given to enjoy our Savior.\n\nGod’s economy is different from anything we’ve ever experienced here on earth. His understanding of time and other resources is complete, whereas ours is limited. But being His children, we don’t need to worry about saving or storing up His goodness in order to make sure they will last another day. Nor do we need to feel ashamed for fully enjoying God and His blessings too much; His glory is consistently and eternally abundant.\n\nNow, we await the day when all His promises will come to fruition (Romans 15:4). Throughout eternity, we will have the privilege of learning more about the One who made those promises to us.\n\nNow, as an act of submission to a loving God, we attempt to live up to our calling as people who are already spotless in His sight, fully loved and wholly accepted (2 Peter 3:16). Throughout eternity, we will enjoy the righteousness Christ has won for us. Sin will be a thing of the past.\n\nNow, God’s ways appear to be hidden from us, but we can trust that they are always better than our understanding (Isaiah 55:8–9). And throughout eternity, we will see Him face to face and know Him as He truly is (1 Corinthians 13:12).\n\nNow, we are called to be on guard, to be sober-minded, so we will not be led astray. Peter instructs us to do this as we “grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 3:17–18). Throughout eternity, we will reign with Him.\n\nEven as we prepare for God’s coming kingdom, He has given us “everything required for life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness” (1 Peter 1:3). As he concludes his second letter, Peter reminds us of this truth that is everlasting: God’s own glory and goodness are ours to receive, enjoy, and share, from now until eternity. To Him be the glory, always. Amen.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nWhat do you do when God’s plans for your life unfold differently than you expected? \n\nThis question arises again and again throughout the Bible. Abraham is promised descendants, but then his wife is barren. Joseph is promised leadership, but then he is thrown into a pit. The disciples are promised a Messiah, but then He is arrested and killed.\n\nOver and over throughout the Bible, God’s people live in a tension between the promises of God and the reality of their present circumstances, and this tension is the context of Revelation.\n\nPrior to the writing of this book, the world had experienced an unprecedented outpouring of the Spirit of God. People saw miraculous signs and wonders. The gospel spread like wildfire. Thousands came to Christ. Lives were changed. It all must have felt fast and furious and wonderful.\n\nAnd then, as if someone had slowly turned off the faucet of God’s power, the revolution seemed to stall. In its place, persecution. Roman authorities increasingly pressured Christians to worship Caesar or face severe punishment. The hostility toward Christians intensified, and this left them wondering: \n\nWhere was God?  What happened to His promises? Is Jesus still coming back?  What do we do now?\n\nSooner or later, we all find ourselves in this place of uncertainty. We wonder if we misheard God or if we did something wrong to provoke Him—or if He is even there at all. And in this place of tension, it’s tempting for doubt to become our compass, instead of faith.\n\nThis is where the book of Revelation begins. The people of God are struggling, and the mission feels unclear. As a result, some Christians are compromising the truth of God’s Word and caving into the culture. Some are disobedient, while others are simply lukewarm. So God reiterates His promises with a “revelation” to John that is glorious and startling and surreal.\n\nIt’s easy to get lost in the imagery of this book, but the first chapter of Revelation holds the key. All we really need to know of “the First and the Last” (v.17) is that Jesus Himself is the definitive “revelation” for the world. Everything we need to know about God, we know through Christ. Everything we need to know about our past, we know through Christ. Everything we need to know about our future, we know through Christ. \n\nNot an inch of God’s Word or God’s plan is out of character with the Son of God, and this is the lens through which we should read everything contained in Revelation. It is tempting to be dogmatic about the meaning of these abstract images, but the point of this book is simple: to direct our trust toward the “Living One” who was dead and is now “alive forever and ever” (v.18).\n\nThis truth about Jesus—about His life, His death, and His resurrection—does not change with our circumstances or with our doubts. It holds. Whatever may come, Jesus is our unstoppable hope, from first to last. That is the message of Revelation, and the message for our lives.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\n“Things are getting worse and worse.”\n\nWhen we look at the news, the culture, the entertainment, and even the Church today, it’s easy to feel as if everything is slowly getting worse. It’s tempting to believe that the world is gradually unraveling, and that we are moving further away from truth, instead of toward it.\n\nWhenever we feel this cynicism begin to creep in, the temptation is to idealize the generations that have gone before us. We think, Our parents’ generation, our grandparents’ generation, the earliest Christians—they had it all together. Things weren’t as bad back then!\n\nI struggle with this mentality often. There are days when I feel jaded about Christians and about the Church. I log onto social media and see division and in-fighting, or I read about a pastor failing his congregation and his family. I see name-calling and judgment and the drawing of big, deep lines, and my heart wants to harden toward it all.\n\nOn those days when we are tempted to dismiss the world with a flick of the wrist, when we find ourselves looking down on other Christians who “aren’t doing it right,” and when we despair that the Church’s reputation is hopelessly smeared, Revelation 2–3 has a word for us.\n\nIn these chapters, written just a generation after Jesus’s resurrection, many churches are distracted and lost. Although they are working hard and striving to be faithful, God also levels the following charges against them: \n\nThey had forsaken their first love (2:4).\n\nThey participated in pagan rituals (2:14).\n\nThey were sexually immoral (2:14).\n\nThey embraced false teaching (2:15, 20).\n\nThey had a reputation of being alive, but they were dead (3:1).\n\nThey were lukewarm, neither hot nor cold (3:16).\n\nAll this, only sixty years after Jesus walked the earth.\n\nWhat this tells us is that the world is not simply getting worse, and neither is the Church. Following Jesus has always been hard. Faithfulness to God has always come unnaturally. Ever since sin entered the world, human nature has found it difficult to obey. \n\nAnd that is exactly why we need a Savior. \n\nThe good news of Jesus Christ begins with the bad news that we are broken. We have always been distracted. We have always resisted the truth. It was true two thousand years ago, and it is just as true today. Therefore, these letters to the seven churches in Asia minor are important for us as well. “Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches” (Revelation 2:29).\n\nBut our brokenness has never stopped God. Our division, our fighting, our apathy, our immorality, even our bad theology—none of it has ever stopped God. So when we read Revelation 2–3, we can do three things. First, we can remember that humanity is not getting worse, and neither is the Church—the temptation to turn away from God and His ways has always been there. Second, we can welcome this list of rebukes as an opportunity to identify our own areas of need. \n\nAnd finally, we can hope. In Revelation 3:19, God says, “Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline” (NIV). When we see darkness in the world—no matter how great—we don’t have to despair, and our hearts don’t have to grow hard. Instead, we can consider the possibility that God is allowing us to see these things, so that He can redeem them. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nOne of my sons’ favorite bedtime stories is The Sword in the Stone. As a child, I grew up watching the animated version of this tale, in which a lanky, awkward boy named Arthur unwittingly prepares to become king. Set in twelfth century England, the legend describes a country in turmoil, where the king has died without an heir to take his place. In order to resolve this dilemma, a wizard named Merlin places a sword in an anvil with the following words inscribed upon it: “Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise King born of all England.”\n\nAs the story goes, plenty of strong men and mighty warriors attempt to remove the sword, but every one of them fails. That is, until Arthur. This young, scrawny, misfit approaches the sword and is able to pull it from the anvil, finally restoring order to the kingdom.\n\nThe legend of Arthur is only a myth, but it echoes a story that is not. In chapters 4 and 5 of Revelation, we encounter a similar scene, but in place of a sword we have a scroll (5:1). We don’t know what exactly is inside the scroll, but New Testament scholar N.T. Wright speculates: “We rightly guess… that it contains God’s secret plan to undo and overthrow the world-destroying projects that have already gained so much ground, and to plant and nurture instead the world-rescuing project which will get creation itself back on track in the right direction.”\n\nMuch like the sword in the stone, what is significant about the scroll is not simply what is inside of it, but Who is able to unseal it. Like the sword, there is only one who is worthy to unleash its power. That chosen one, we soon discover, is Jesus—the “Lamb,” the “Root of David,” the “Lion from the tribe of Judah” (5:6,5). Christ alone can initiate God’s plan to rescue and redeem the world. \n\nThat is how the two stories are similar. This is how they differ:\n\nIn The Sword and the Stone, Arthur does nothing to earn the title of king. Although legend holds that he was secretly a royal heir, Arthur’s worthiness (much like Abraham, Moses, and David) comes solely from the fact that he is chosen for the task. He does not earn it, and he does not deserve it.\n\nChrist, on the other hand, is a different kind of hero. He is not simply plucked from thin air. Instead, the Lamb is worthy for two important reasons. First, He is worthy to redeem the brokenness of the world because He is the only one who did not contribute to it. And second, He is worthy to rescue humanity because He purchased us by His blood (5:9). \n\nUnlike most of our favorite heroes, Jesus was not chosen in spite of Himself. Even our greatest heroes, our noblest heroes, our most perfect heroes are still only a shadow of the Hero we have in Christ. By virtue of His identity and by the power of His blood, He alone is able to open the scroll and initiate God’s plan to redeem the world.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nEvery year, wildfires break out on America’s west coast, decimating forests and grasslands, threatening homes, and turning the sunset skies into a haze of pink. The power of fire is terrifying and awesome, and we’ve all seen the danger it poses to homes and lives in its path. While fire holds a mighty power for destruction, the land on the west coast actually needs a certain amount of these fires; they clean forest floors, pare down the plants that consume the water, kill plant diseases, and release seeds from trees that require fire to start the next generation. Don’t let the power and terror of fire mask the severe good that it serves.\n\nThe coming of God’s judgment is a terror to the wicked, but it is a comfort to His children. God’s judgment is not blind punishment. It is the setting right of all things. God comes to judge sin and avenge injustice. And in Scripture we see that He holds back judgment for a time so that many more might come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). To those who trust in Him, His judgment is a refining fire that strips away sin and removes the sting of death. God’s judgment sets the world right again.\n\nHe comes to undo the curse and make all things new. God’s judgment carries this beautiful promise: “They will no longer hunger; they will no longer thirst; the sun will no longer strike them, nor will any scorching heat” (Revelation 7:16). What a joyful declaration! Our king will take away the curse of sin and death and bring us to a place of satiety and comfort. I love that the God of the universe cares whether or not I’m hungry or too hot. Our personal comfort seems so small on the universal scale of things. God’s concern for even our thirst is an indication of His tender, personal love.\n\nGod’s final judgment comes to reveal His reign. For all things are His. The whole book of Revelation (indeed the whole canon of Scripture) is about Christ, and this is what it says about Him: He’s seated on a throne (v.17); He is wise and powerful, never caught off guard (v.12 ); He shelters us, and we are safe in Him (v.15); and His gospel is true (v.10).\n\nThe burning fire of God’s judgment is unquestionably a terror to those who do not know Him. But to those who are called by His name—to His own children—the coming of His judgment heralds the setting right of all things. He comes to rescue His children and bring them home.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThe language in today’s passage is full of rich imagery: a flaming mountain is thrown into the sea, a third of the stars are blackened, and crowned locusts ride horses with scorpion tails into battle. It’s both chillingly specific and massively cryptic—and why are there seven seals, anyway? Before we get carried away, we have to remember that Scripture must first be interpreted through the lens of Scripture. So where else in Scripture do we see the number seven? It’s a parallel to the seven days of creation, the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, Jacob’s seven years of service to Laban, the seven trumpets of Jericho, etc. In God’s Word, seven is a number of completion.\n\nIn all the swirling imagery, the central purpose of all Scripture is to teach the good news of the gospel: Christ has come to save. And the whole book of Revelation is just the same. These judgments show us the completion of God’s good work. And the end purpose of God’s work of salvation is that He should abide with us, and we with Him. He is our God, and we are His people.\n\nBecause we are His, we can rejoice at His coming, and at the restoration of righteousness. Judgment must come. Justice is necessary because He is justice. He will make all things right. He will not allow wickedness to go on forever. \n\nGod’s judgment is total, and our only escape is Jesus. For those of us in Christ, our judgment was paid by Christ at the cross. The weight of our judgment has already fallen on Him. Therefore, we should rejoice at God’s coming judgment, because it will restore righteousness.\n\nWe are His, and so we need not fear any present tribulation. The consequences of evil in this world are scary, and the threat to believers is real. But the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous (1 Peter 3:12). He is always with us, and He cares for us. His ears are open to our prayers, and He is not indifferent to our cries. Even in judgment, God is merciful to those who love Him. \n\nWe need not fear, because we are His. Instead, we can be people of hope, joy, and peace. This is cause for great rejoicing. His justice is ongoing, and this passage is not the final judgment but a picture of God’s ongoing work in the world. He is constantly doling out mercy to us, deferring judgment, calling us back to Him. His work is not done in our families or in our communities. Therefore, have hope for your children, for your parents, and for your neighbors who are not yet believers. God is constantly at work.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThe Arctic Tern gets more sunlight than any other animal on earth. These birds migrate from pole to pole every year, covering about 25,000 miles. Summering at the north pole, they enjoy weeks of 24-hour sunlight, and at the other end of their migration, they bask in the same full-sun days at the south pole. They literally chase summer all over the globe. If it weren’t so hard, we might all be tempted to do it—imagine a beautiful summer that never ends.\n\nThe point of the whole book of Revelation is the glory of Christ. His glory is so big and so wonderful that I have to imagine endless, gorgeous, sunshine-filled days to get in the right frame of mind. We can’t even grasp what it would be like to live in the glow of His glory, but I know that it will be good. So good.\n\nWe get a glimpse of His glory in the mighty angel standing astride sea and land in today’s reading (Revelation 10:5). Based on the being’s majestic description, many commentators believe this “angel” to be Christ Himself. Regardless of one’s interpretation of this particular passage, however, the whole of Scripture points to this beautiful truth: Christ is worthy. The end result of the judgment and war brings us back to where we began: the Word made flesh mercifully for us.\n\nBecause Christ is worthy, we know that the nations and kingdoms of this world are only temporary. God’s kingdom is the only one that will last. The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever (Revelation 11:15). Christ receives all the kingdoms as His inheritance, which He delivers to the Father (1 Corinthians 15:24–28). And for those who love and trust in Him, the eternal kingdom becomes our inheritance in Christ (1 Peter 1:3–5).\n\nFinally, God finishes His work. “Then he said to me, ‘It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end’” (Revelation 21:6). There is no stopping or undoing what God has done. Our redemption is sure and complete in Christ. And He will bring to completion the work of sanctification and glorification when He comes again. And so we pray: “Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10).\n\nIn Revelation we see Christ, fully worthy and glorified. He is the beginning and the end of all our stories. And we will bask in the warmth and light of His glory for all eternity. It is more than I can imagine. Come quickly, Lord Jesus!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nOne of my favorite hymns is “For All the Saints.” I was reminded of it when reflecting on today’s reading. Every verse of the song compels us to cling to “our Rock, our Fortress,” and “our Captain” in the battle, as we keep our eyes trained toward a more glorious day yet to come. It echoes this truth from Revelation: God is and forever will be seated on His throne, and all the heavenly hosts give glory, honor, and thanks to Him. The hymn continues:\n\nAnd when the strife is fierce, the warfare long; Steals on the ear the distant triumph song.  And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.  Alleluia! Alleluia!\n\nThe strife really is fierce, and it has been since the serpent sowed deceit and destruction in the garden of Eden. Our fear of God, alienation from Him and one another, deceit and pride and endless greed—these things tore the fabric of our human existence before the curse was pronounced upon the serpent. \n\nAnd yet in the midst of Genesis 3, God declared a message of hope that has echoed throughout human history: the offspring of the woman would one day “crush” the serpent’s head (v.15). True, the serpent would “crush” (yes, it’s the same word in Hebrew) the heel of Eve’s offspring—a lethal blow, but one that would end in the greatest, most victorious event in human history: the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. \n\nThat malevolent serpent has since donned many hideous characteristics, and Revelation 12 does not mince words when describing the evil one. We read that the “great fiery red dragon” has been intent on devouring the woman (representing Israel, God’s people) and her Son, Jesus the Messiah. There is an appallingly fierce war in the heavenly realms, one we can hardly imagine. The grim powers of evil and the mighty forces of good tangle with each other. The dragon is identified as the ancient serpent, the devil, who leads the whole world astray. This is serious in the extreme, not to be dismissed with a wave of our enlightened hand. (We often do that.)\n\nIn other words, our battle here on earth is not done. We face the rage of the devil who knows his time is short and his end sure (v.12). But we also know the perspective from God’s throne:\n\nThen I heard a loud voice in heaven say, “The salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have now come, because the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night,  has been thrown down” (v.10).\n\nAs painful as our suffering here on earth is, victory is ours by the blood of the Lamb (v.11). We are empowered by and rest in the assurance that God has made us alive in Christ, that Lamb sitting on the throne. His shed blood has cancelled out the debt we owe, and the enemy has been disarmed completely. The serpent’s head has been crushed at the cross (Colossians 2:13–15). \n\nAlleluia indeed. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nThere is just no way around it. The apocalyptic scene described in Revelation 13 is horrifying. It appears that every possible embodiment of sheer evil will be turned loose on the world—particularly against those who “hold firmly” to the testimony of Jesus (12:17). Add to that, supernatural deception and oppressive brutality will be the all-encompassing order of the day (13:13–17). Everything is utter calamity. How can we possibly face the prospect of such disasters? I don’t know about you, but I’d prefer to simply disappear before the catastrophe begins.\n\nBut what about today, here and now? As we consider our own times, what can we say to encourage God’s people who are currently facing such ferocious animosity? How do we pray for believers whose lives are threatened day in and day out by vicious, nearly unimaginable manifestations of hatred? While Revelation 13 may be part of a much more comprehensive and sober glimpse into the future, there are also crucial lessons for us today.\n\nBottom line for now: there are no easy answers when God’s people are faced with cruel injustices. There are no detours around the painful suffering brought about by those who practice evil. Instead, “this calls for endurance and faithfulness from the saints” (13:10). We are called to stand with those who are subjected to persecution, insults, and unjust treatment (Hebrews 10:33–34). \n\nAnd how can we best do that? With fervent intercessory prayer. Scripture tells us that God is always with us, but with fervent intercessory prayer, we can pray for His presence to be known and felt by those who suffer. We can cry out on their behalf, asking God to grant them peace. \n\nIn talking with friends and acquaintances whose suffering makes my own experiences pale in comparison, I have been both humbled and amazed by what their words have in common. As a result of their truly grim circumstances, they have come to know a deeper intimacy with God. May such be true for all of us!\n\nIt’s difficult to pray well, but it’s important to proclaim God’s “great and precious promises” (2 Peter 1:4) on behalf of those who need endurance for each coming hour. May they (and we) be assured that the One who is coming will not delay (Hebrews 10:37) and that there awaits us “a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 1:11, NIV). We cling to these truths even when everything else seems to give way at the very foundations (Psalm 46). \n\nThat “rich welcome” that awaits God’s faithful and enduring people has stayed generations of believers. The book of Hebrews assures us that we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses as we run the race set before us. I like to think of them cheering on God’s faithful people as we feebly struggle, yet keeping our eyes on “the source and perfecter of our faith” (Hebrews 12:1–2). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nThe thundering voice from heaven.The new song before God’s throne.The proclamation of the eternal gospel across the globe.\n\nIn reading Revelation 14, we begin to hear the echoes of hope, when each mighty angel from the heavenly realms announces that the final hour of judgment has come. We’re told there will be harvests—first the reaping of ripe grain and then the gathering of clusters of grapes for the winepress, God’s wrath. And while the image of God’s wrath and judgment seems unimaginable and terrifying, it’s actually good news: Those who’ve worshiped the beast, the embodiment of evil, and carried out his vicious schemes will one day drink the wine of God’s wrath (14:9–11).\n\nWine is an image reverberating out from Old Testament prophets (Isaiah 51:17–23; Jeremiah 25:15–31; Habakkuk 2:16), through Psalm 75:7–8, and into the garden of Gethsemane (Matthew 26). It’s there that Jesus, knowing full well what was coming, prayed that the “cup” might be taken from Him. Then in utter and complete submission to the perfect will of His Father, He said, “Yet not as I will, but as you will,” and took in the full cup of God’s righteous wrath (v.39).\n\nBut as the redeemed, we have hope, and this is where our hope lies: with the victorious Lamb who takes away the sin of the world and rescues us from God’s coming wrath (John 1:29; 1 Thessalonians 1:10). Until that day, we are called to remain faithful and endure (Revelation 14:12). Death has not yet been dealt its final lethal blow, but in the meantime, we trust in the promise that those saints “who die in the Lord” will one day find “rest from their labors” (v.13). \n\nLooking forward, the author of Hebrews assures us that we are headed for the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the living God. We are headed to the welcome of thousands upon thousands of the angelic host, as well as other believers, whose names are written in heaven. It’s there that Jesus, our perfect Mediator, faithfully intercedes for us, even today (Hebrews 12:22–24).\n\nSo let those who have been redeemed from the hand of the enemy—those gathered from all the lands, east, west, north, and south—give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! (Psalm 107:1–3). Let those from every nation, tribe, language, and people join in a mighty chorus of praise for the Lamb who has overcome. And let us join as a mighty chorus, praising and worshiping “the one who made the heaven and earth” and then redeemed them for eternity (Revelation 14:7).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nWhen it comes to how to respond to the righteous judgment of God, we only have two options. We can worship in wonder or we can wave a rebel fist. There is no middle ground, no gray area, no third option. Just worship or rebellion, reverence or revolt. \n\nHere, in Revelation 15–16 we see a picture of the wrath of God poured out. It’s a terrifying image, bowls filled to the brim with the righteous judgment of God. As squeamish as God’s wrath may make us, deep down, we know He is justified. We look around at mankind and inwardly at our own wicked hearts and must repeat the cry of heaven: \n\n“They deserve it!”…  “Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, True and just are your judgments” (Revelation 16:6–7).\n\nNotice that in these passages, no one is arguing with God’s justice. No scales are needed to weigh and consider the justice of God. Over and over we read that these grisly judgments are in line with a fair and true God. This is justice in its purest form. And yet it’s possible, even when His justice is deserved and devastating, to choose insurrection over His goodness and mercy. Though the judgments certainly take center stage here, there is still an undercurrent of the people’s rebellion within these passages:\n\nThey “blasphemed the name of God… and they did not repent and give him glory” (v.9). They “blasphemed the God of heaven… they did not repent of their works” (v.11).They “blasphemed God” (v.21).\n\nConsider those pummeled by the final bowl of wrath. Though buried under hailstones weighing a hundred pounds, they still shook rebel fists at God. If we are honest with our own hearts, we see that our own rebellious streak runs just as deep. Our own eye for justice is just as distorted. \n\nBut God, in His infinite mercy has unclenched our rebel fists. We are shielded from God’s ultimate judgment and are now “hidden with Christ in God” (Colossians 3:3). Instead of continuing in rebellion, God’s grace has taught us to respond like Israel when the nation witnessed God’s wrath on Pharaoh and His men. \n\n“Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord. They said:\n\n ‘I will sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted; he has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea… \n\nLORD, who is like you among the gods?\n\nWho is like you, glorious in holiness,\n\nrevered with praises, performing wonders?’” (Exodus 15:1,11). \n\nGod’s righteous wrath isn’t all penned up for the Day of Judgment. Even now He judges the wicked. Even now He has the right to rule our hearts and lives. When face to face with His judgment we only have two options. Because He is so worthy, may we choose to worship the God who is just. \n\n",

Sadly, since the fall of humanity in the garden of Eden, this shoe always seems to fit. \n\nHere in Revelation 17, we see humankind’s perversion of power personified in the prostitute. She is dressed to impress and mired in scandal. She is greedy, flashy, and horrid. I find it hard to look away. This passage has plenty of mysteries, and I won’t claim to understand them all. But life on planet earth has trained me to recognize the distorting effects of power. She is every ruler who has ever reigned and every heart twisted and broken by sin. \n\nShe is presidents and prime ministers, congressmen and counselors. She embodies parents and principals, laws and limitations. But one thing she is not—she is not the Lamb of God. Neither is the beast who is with her. Their rule and reign is fleeting. With that in mind, look closely at how the beast is described: \n\n“The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up from the abyss and go to destruction. Those who live on the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast that was, and is not, and is to come” (Revelation 8, emphasis mine).\n\nStack those words up against these descriptions of Jesus (again, emphasis mine): \n\n“Grace and peace to you from the one who is, who was, and who is to come” (Revelation 1:4).\n\n“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “the one who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty” (Revelation 1:8). \n\n“Each of the four living creatures had six wings; they were covered with eyes around and inside. Day and night they never stop, saying,\n\nHoly, holy, holy,Lord God, the Almighty,who was, who is, and who is to come” (Revelation 4:8). \n\nThe beast will reign until he doesn’t. The prostitute may have a moment in the limelight, but she cannot diminish the Light of the World by a single lumen. Every leader who has ever ruled, every king who has ever been crowned, every circumstance that has ever terrorized you—all will come to an end. But Christ will remain. Only His throne is established forever. \n\nPolitical leaders aren’t the only ones with power over me. If I keep looking inward, at my own power-hungry heart, I see some of me in the prostitute as well. I keep clawing my way back onto the throne that sits in my heart. I keep trying to take control away from the only One who is worthy to rule. Yet, the reign of sin will not last forever inside of me because brokenness won’t always be king of this world. \n\nBecause of Jesus, sin’s power is not ultimate. Sin was, but will be no more. Only the spotless Lamb and His Bride will remain. Long live the King of kings! \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nTheologians with far more degrees on their walls and books on their shelves than I have can continue to debate who Babylon represents in Revelation 18. I simply don’t have the brain cells to compete. But because of the wisdom granted by the Holy Spirit, I do have what it takes to read this passage and consider this question: Where is the redemptive hand of God in these verses?\n\nThe fall of Babylon, like so much of John’s revelation, is mysterious, but when we take a closer look, we see that the gospel thread is clearly present. God’s redemptive work, which stitches all of His Word together, is beautifully and unmistakably revealed throughout this book. \n\nConsider the angel’s loud declaration, “It has fallen, Babylon the Great has fallen!” (Revelation 18:2). And then compare that declaration to Christ’s quiet resolve at the crucifixion: “When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, ‘It is finished.’ Then bowing his head, he gave up his spirit” (John 19:30). \n\nBecause of what He accomplished on the cross, all evil will crumble, every Babylon will fall, all “injustice [will shut] its mouth” (Psalm 107:42). Anything that opposes God will fall. Babylon’s sins were piled up to heaven—so were mine, so were yours—“and God remembered her crimes” (Revelation 18:5). As well He should have. But our transgressions? Our sins? He has forgotten them. \n\n“For I will forgive their wrongdoing, and I will never again remember their sins” (Hebrews 8:12).\n\nI have to remind myself often that God won’t dredge my sin back up. Not now. Not ever. Babylon’s ending is not my own. My sins have been thrown into the depths of the sea. I will receive undeserved grace, but Babylon will receive deserved destruction, paid according to her works of evil, and therefore, earning a double portion of wrath. \n\nBut “He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began” (2 Timothy 1:9). We are spared because of Christ’s work—not punished according to our own. \n\nGod certainly could have wiped me out forever. Instead, He has rebuilt my life on the precious cornerstone of His grace. And so as Christ-followers, we are to “rejoice… because God has pronounced on [Babylon] the judgment she passed” on us (Revelation 18:20).\n\nWicked Babylon is a picture of the enemy’s schemes. Seemingly secure in his triumph, fortified by the forces of darkness, for a fleeting moment he, too, appeared untouchable. And yet, our enemy has fallen. Call it out in a mighty voice! In a single hour he became a defeated foe (v.17). In a moment, with the flash of an angel, the stone rolled away, and evil crumbled. God’s plans for our redemption could not be stopped. Not then. Not now. Not ever.\n\nThe world may weep and mourn when evil crumbles, but heaven will always rejoice. Ours is a God who triumphs over evil. He redeems us for His glory. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nAs most brides do, I had high hopes (and perhaps delusions) that my wedding day would be perfect. For me, it almost was. Almost. \n\nOn a steamy Saturday in May 2001, Chad and I were preparing for our big day. My bridesmaids and I drove to the church and went to the make-shift bridal suite to start getting ready. I don’t remember how long we there before one of my bridesmaids came in and said, “Whit, you need to get upstairs because there’s a massive storm headed our way. If we don’t get you into the sanctuary now, you may have to walk in the rain.”\n\nThe church where we were getting married had two separate buildings. And there wasn’t a way for me to get from where I was to the vestibule, where I would walk down the aisle, unless I went outside. This was our window to avoid the storm, and we needed to go now. \n\nWe gathered up all our stuff and made the trek up to the sanctuary. The gorgeous blue sky that had welcomed us earlier when we first arrived was now hidden by ominous, dark clouds. Yes, a storm was imminent. Happy wedding day to us.\n\nWe piled into the foyer, but quickly realized that it wouldn’t do for the bride to be standing there greeting all the guests when they arrived. The only option we had was to file into the ladies’ restroom. It was like a bad joke: “How do you fit a bride and ten bridesmaids into a bathroom the size of a mid-size sedan?” As it turns out, not easily. \n\nI spent my last hour of single life stuffed into a church bathroom. But through it all though, my bridesmaids— my best friends dressed in sea-foam green (bless them!)—were so kind, faithful, funny, and selfless. Missi, my college roommate, had me laughing. Meredith, my soon- to-be sister-in-law, kept refilling my water. Lori and Ashley were loyal lookouts, reporting back to me who had just arrived. It’s now one of the sweetest memories of my wedding day, each of my friends making sure in her own way that I was wedding-day ready—the most beautiful, confident version of myself I could be. \n\nThe Church, the global and eternal collection of God’s people, is Christ’s Bride, and her wedding day is fast approaching. Despite the gathering clouds of external opposition and internal grumbling, all who are made alive in Christ—single, married, divorced, or widowed—need to be doing our part to make Her wedding-day ready. \n\nIt is theologically true that we, the Church, are the Bride of Christ, beautiful and beloved by Jesus Christ, our Bridegroom (Revelation 21:2). And one day, our wedding and reception, called the marriage supper of the Lamb, will be the most perfect, extravagant party you can imagine (19:6–10). \n\nHowever, I think in some ways we serve another wedding day role: that of bridesmaids. Part of our job is to make sure that the Bride is as lovely and wedding-day ready as she can be. Our goal is for the Bride to look radiant. We are partly responsible for what those outside the Christian faith think of the Bride. \n\nThat might sound good, but maybe you haven’t seen much of the resplendent Bride. Perhaps you’ve been bulldozed by a bit of a Bridezilla instead. And to that, I can relate all too well; I know the pain the Church can inflict. I truly, truly do. But while she may be messy, she is also redeemed. \n\nEven when our hurts are legitimately and deeply wounded, our challenge is to remember that Jesus loves His Bride. He doesn’t ignore her flaws or shortcomings, and He never, ever condones abuse of any kind—but make no mistake, Christ loves the Church He died to save.\n\nToday, we are standing in the vestibule of human history. We can’t know for sure when the doors will swing open and we’ll see Jesus coming for us. Between now and then, let’s do all we can to be ready for our Bridegroom.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nAs the consummation of redemptive history unfolds, God’s plan is nearly complete, and Revelation 21 and 22 tell us what will be regained and restored. But at this point in the narrative, it’s helpful to remind ourselves not just what we will gain, but what will be lost. \n\nIn the first garden, when sin entered the world, perfection was broken, marred and spoiled. A seemingly unbridgeable chasm was created between what God had intended and what humanity would now experience. Perfection was made imperfect. The devastating effect of our rebellion was all-encompassing, wrecking ourselves, our relationships, and creation. Nothing was left untouched. \n\nSin is the most aggressive of cancers. Let’s look at a few of its fatal symptoms.\n\nSin separates. The first and most catastrophic effect of the fall was how sin destroyed our intimacy with our Creator. Once His friends, we became His enemies. No longer able to enjoy intimate, unbroken fellowship with God, we hid. And as a result of our sin, we were ejected from the garden. In His mercy, God spared Adam and Eve from staying in Eden and eating from the tree of life, which would have left us forever broken (Genesis 3:22–24).\n\nSin sentences us to death. Expelled from Eden, humanity was lost, but not beyond restoration. There is hope for the fallen, but we are not spared death, which is the second consequence of sin. Every person will succumb. No one can escape it. Our bodies are breaking down. Death looms for us and our loved ones. Though we will be raised to life in Christ, most of us will mourn many times over before we see our Maker. Death, mourning, crying, and pain are the result of the fall, full of emotions we were never meant to experience. \n\nSin spoils everything. Not only does sin separate and sentence us to death, it spoils and ruins. Eden was pristine, peace-filled, and perfect. After the fall, what would have been eternally new was now destined for decay. Creation was fractured, and humanity was plunged into conflict with the rest of God’s creatures. Now creation groans and travails awaiting the restoration of what was lost. \n\nThis is the backdrop of Revelation 21. Separation. Ruin. Decay. Death. God isn’t just creating a new heaven and a new earth, glorious as that is. No, He is restoring perfection, ridding us of all the residue and side-effects of sin. Look at what He promises.\n\nWhat sin had separated, God rejoins. For the ancient Near East, water, particularly the sea, represented chaos and danger. Our new heaven and earth won’t have a sea. More profoundly, the chasm between Creator and creation has been closed. God now dwells with His people in a world where sin, decay, and death are no more. Where we once were destined for cyclical mourning, pain, and grief, we are now promised the joy and comfort of dwelling with God forever.\n\nWe were Adam and Eve’s co-conspirators, and we have lived with a death sentence ever since. But our God is now making all things new, putting an end to all that was broken. What we had forfeited, He has restored. \n\nHe was there at the beginning, our Alpha. And He is now standing at the End, our Omega. What He started, He is gloriously finishing.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nRevelation 21 and 22 paint a lovely picture of the promised end of our story, but we are not home yet. Our destination is certain and secure, but friend, we have not arrived. There is still work to be done.\n\nBelievers living on this side of the cross live in a tenuous “now” and “not yet.” Because of the resurrection of Jesus and the indwelling of His Holy Spirit, we can experience some of the kingdom now. The fruit of the Spirit is a present promise for those of us who surrender to His Lordship. We can enjoy and display love, joy, peace, patience, and kindness today.\n\nWe can grieve in a unique and gospel-centered way. We do not grieve as those who have no hope (1 Thessalonians 4:13). We mourn, but we are comforted by the hope of heaven. We can live in a fallen and fractured world without succumbing to fear or a fatalistic perspective that nothing can redeem the brokenness around us. \n\nThe call to persevere is the command for us to live as sojourners who are passing through to our eternal Promised Land. But we don’t fix our eyes on Jesus, the author, source, and perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:2), to the exclusion of others. We cannot ignore those around us. Not at all. I believe this is why Christ commanded John to write instructions for God’s people before He unfolded what was coming. Revelation opens with a clarion call to the Church, and the letters to the seven churches (Revelation 2–3) should still be the filter through which we view this “end.” We have a job to do, and Jesus expects us to do it well. \n\nWe must persevere in the face of crushing secularism and punishing persecution, passionately clinging to the gospel. When we persevere, we live with the same kind of urgency that moved Jesus to say, “I am coming soon!” (Revelation 22:7). We stay mindful that none of us—not our lost neighbor, sinful co-worker, or rebellious family member—is promised tomorrow. We and the strangers all around us are walking toward a sure judgment. One day grief will be no more, but that day is not today. However, grief does serve a purpose. It arrests our hearts with compassion and compels us to action. We ought to grieve what is coming and then live a life that proclaims the hope that Jesus’s death and resurrection secured. \n\nYes, the kingdom is both now and not yet for you and me. We can experience it now, and we must proclaim it to those who have not yet received it. And whether they persist in doing evil, as Jesus says in Revelation 22, we stay the course in faithfully preaching of the gospel in word and deed. We preach it now because His return is not yet. There is still time, and we must steward it well.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nGod created us as complex creatures, capable of feeling and sensing a whole garden of emotions. Made in the image of our Creator, we can both grieve the wrongs of this world, and celebrate the sweetness of this life. This 2-week reading plan will lead us through a series of passages from Scripture that examine the seasons of mourning and dancing in the life of a believer. In the written responses here on the site, our writers will enter into this tension, articulating their personal experiences with grief and joy in hopes of freeing you to explore your own. By immersing our hearts and minds in God’s Word, and honestly presenting our laments to Him, may we remember that God is present with us, He is good, and He is faithful. \n\nOn the day our daughter died, I planted flowers.\n\nIt was April in Tennessee, and the reality that my child was hanging in a precarious balance between life and death, in part because my womb was acting as her life support, was never far from my mind. That Monday morning, I kissed my husband and weekend guests out the door, then helped my toddler son get dressed and fed him yogurt and Cheerios for breakfast.\n\nEven while death was happening, so was life.\n\nThat Monday morning, we blew bubbles. We played on the swing set. I read a book on the back porch, and we snacked on strawberries. When my toddler was fast asleep in his crib, I slipped my hands into a pair of old gardening gloves, knelt in the dirt, and got to work with my spade. Bent over my pregnant belly, hands in the soil, the evidence of life kicked and turned within me. The gravity of the moment was lost on me at the time, but I see it now. \n\nPlanting. Acting on hope. Believing promises. Burying seeds in the darkness. Knowing a thing can only produce something beautiful if it dies first (John 12:24). Ecclesiastes 3 tells us there is a time for every matter under heaven.\n\nA time to be born, and a time to die.A time to plant, and a time to uproot.A time to weep, and a time to laugh.A time to mourn, and a time to dance.\n\nFor our precious daughter, that Monday afternoon in April was a time to die. For us, it was a time to mourn. But it was also a time to actively hope in promises that life comes from death. It was a time to dance because our child was in the presence of her Savior.\n\nThat day, not knowing what the night would hold, the Lord led me through the motions of actively hoping and believing that death brings life. An object lesson of the resurrection in my soil-covered hands, I could not have known these would be some of the last turns and kicks I’d ever feel. And so, I planted.\n\nLife and death are not respecters of each other. Mourning and dancing—they don’t always take turns. Not in my story, not in yours, not in our world. While people celebrate weddings and first steps and the sweetness of life, the broken world continues to break our hearts, sometimes at the very same time. The tension is there—wondering when to celebrate and when to cry. Often the best thing we can do is acknowledge that tension and do both, seeking the Lord as we navigate the complexities of this world.\n\nWe must never stop mourning brokenness. It is right to mourn. And we must never cease to celebrate life and beauty. It is right to dance. Because of Christ, life comes from death. Because of Christ, we will dance again.\n\n“Truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice.  You will become sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn to joy” (John 16:20).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nWhen I was nine, I had a theory that it always rained on Good Friday. And in my limited experience north of the Mason-Dixon line, it did rain on most Fridays before Easter. This made me believe that the earth was grieving, groaning, and remembering the world-altering death of Christ on that day. Looking up from my coloring book there at the dining room table to the cold, spring rain on our grass, I felt what I still feel today: sadness. \n\nA feeling of melancholy, sentimental or otherwise, over the death of Christ is certainly not an emotion unique to little girls in the Midwest. Christ’s misery was deeply painful to those who were with Him on that day, and is still real to us today. In his “Homily of the Passion,” second-century bishop Melito of Sardis wondered:\n\nWhat new mystery is this?The judge is judged and remains silent;The invisible one is seen and does not hide himself;The incomprehensible one is comprehended and does not resist;The unmeasurable one is measured and does not struggle;The one beyond suffering suffers and does not avenge himself;The immortal one dies and does not refuse death.What new mystery is this?\n\nWe can join the bishop in his wonder at this deep and painful mystery. And it is right that we should mourn. It is right that we want to turn away from the thought of Christ crucified. It is truly painful, and it’s the pain of the world turned upside down. Immortality gasping for breath means something has gone terribly wrong.\n\nThe wrong is written on our own foreheads. Every Ash Wednesday, we remember that we are the ones who are dust and ashes, that the sin that turned the world upside down is our sin. It is my sin—my daily run-of-the-mill gossip and petty jealousy. In spite of my horror and grief when I remember Christ’s suffering, I also rise up in joyous wonder that He has taken my place.\n\nThere is a tension here. We mourn at the pain of Christ’s suffering, but we dance—and I do mean dance—because we are restored by His sacrifice. My grief can turn to celebration because, like Paul, “I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me” (Galatians 2:20). What a glorious realization of our freedom! \n\nIt doesn’t matter whether or not I think it should rain on Good Friday as some symbol of cosmic mourning. What matters is that on a certain day, many years ago, the sky turned black (Matthew 27:45), the world was turned upside down, and the Son of God gave Himself for us. And in spite of our sadness, we will forever rejoice.\n\n",

When I see its effects on the people I love, when I’m granted an objective view of its effects on my own heart, when I remember how utterly contrary to the gospel it is—those are the times my sin brings me to my knees. But on most days, any average, busy day, I ignore it. Not only that, I tend to it under the radar, taking care to subtly stoke its flame.\n\nIt’s the sin of self-absorption.\n\nThere are flashier sins out there, and I have plenty of those to repent of too. But my bent to only see the world as relative to me—what I think, what I need, what I hope, what I believe—has single-handedly caused more collateral damage than most of those other sins put together.\n\nIt is the sin I’ve used to belittle my children, putting my need for space and silence before their need for love and listening.\n\nIt is the sin I’ve used to put off my friends, glossing over their hurts and hard spots in favor of redirecting their eyes to my own.\n\nIt is the sin I’ve used to not love my neighbors, ignoring instead of listening, choosing indifference over engagement.\n\nIt is the sin I’ve used to quench the Holy Spirit, looking past conviction and clutching harder to my idols.\n\nThese aren’t just phrases on a screen. These are real choices made in real relationships with real people—people I’ve hurt in large and small ways when I cling to the shards of my shattered self instead of embracing the life Christ calls me to live. There are wounds I can’t mend, moments I can’t get back, words I can’t rewind. My sin is deep. My heart aches to think of the vastness of things done and left undone.\n\nScripture says the Lord examines our hearts. All manner of our sins are known to Him. And our holy God, knowing every ounce of our sin, must “give to each according to his way, according to what his actions deserve” (Jeremiah 17:10). And He did. But Christ intervened, taking the Father’s holy wrath on Himself.\n\nWhen Christ went to the cross, He wore the dirty rags of my attempts at righteousness, the stench of my selfishness, the weight of my blatant refusal to worship my Creator with all that I am. He suffered, not because God the Father is cruel, but because my sin was heinous and merited punishment. He bled, not because He was weak but because I am. He died, not because they executed Him, but because a sacrifice was required. When Christ went to the cross, He left nothing undone.\n\nI hate my sin. And I hate that I don’t always hate my sin. I am broken, not in a sweet, sentimental, sing-songy way, but in a real, painful, and pain-inducing way. I am broken in a way that often breaks the people around me. I am broken in a way that should, logically speaking, separate me from a holy God. But Christ’s death is not a legend, not a story we tell to sober us into false humility or ankle-deep love. No, Christ’s death is true. His death was full, complete. Our debt has been paid by Jesus’s death, and our hope has been eternally sealed by His resurrection.\n\nI weep with sorrow for my sin. I weep with joy for my redemption. And nothing, not even myself and my sin, will ever separate me from the love of God in Jesus Christ (Romans 8:35). Thanks be to Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nThere is an Irish poet named John O’Donohue who writes blessings for many types of life experiences. In his piece “A Blessing for a Friend on the Arrival of Illness,” he says, “May you find in yourself a courageous hospitality towards what is difficult, painful, and unknown. May you use this illness as a lantern to illuminate the new qualities that will emerge in you.” \n\nMy friend Greg read this aloud at a songwriting retreat this spring, and the moment I heard it, I was moved. The poet’s words were at the same time deeply comforting and deeply provoking. Although Donohue was writing specifically of illness, his words spoke to the greater reality that each of our mortal bodies is slowly dying, yet there is wisdom and beauty to be harvested on the journey. We can use our mortality as a lantern. I don’t know about you, but I enjoy showing hospitality to others far more than I enjoy showing it to myself—especially to my fragile body. \n\nIn Psalm 103:15–16, the psalmist describes how our days are like the grass and flowers of the field that vanish. There is beauty in this fragility. But our modern culture is uncomfortable with our own mortality because we’re so removed from death—animal death, human death, even the death of our dreams. The American dream tells me I can have and do whatever my heart wants, but often what my heart wants is outside my control and slips through my fingers. It is like those grasses of the field. What endures is the life to come, our eternal inheritance that is sturdy and true and real enough to last. \n\nThough it’s easy to admire the seemingly timeless endurance of human achievements like the great cathedrals or other wonders of the world, knowing that my own skin and bones are more susceptible to death than these is something of a paradox. How strange that these artifacts would outlive the humans who built them. But this past summer, we observed how even the grandeur of Notre Dame was not enough to protect it from being partially consumed by fire. Even what appears timeless isn’t always so.\n\nWe would be without hope if it weren’t for the promised redemption of all things. Christ is making all things new. Scripture says that “Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away” (Revelation 21:4–5). The hope of new heavens and a new earth and new bodies doesn’t take away the sting of these current decaying ones, but it should relieve some of the despair attached to it. \n\nMay we show ourselves a courageous hospitality. May those deep, dark, dying places inside us reveal even deeper ways to enter into the love of Jesus, no matter what season we find ourselves in. Although the process is painful, it enlarges our understanding of God and what it means to be co-heirs with Christ and His coming, eternal kingdom. This is not all there is. Mourning will end in dancing, and death will end in life.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nMy very first memory is the day I became a sister. As soon as the birth of my baby brother was announced, I kicked open the maternity ward doors with my red Keds, singing, “I’m a Little Teapot” at the top of my lungs. He was the tiniest, sweetest, greatest thing to happen to my two-and-a-half-year-old life. \n\nA few years later, I’d be clever enough to replace the words in another favorite nursery rhyme, “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” with my own name and reality, singing, \n\nMary Kaitlin had a little brother,Had a little brother, had a little brother.Mary Kaitlin had a little brotherWho lived in her house too.\n\nI taught the song to my classmates, who’d sing it as I paraded through the elementary school carpool line, hand in hand with my little lamb. Some days I still wake up with this tune stuck in my head, rolling over to realize, yet again, the song’s taunting truth: I had a little brother—past tense. He’s gone now. \n\nIn the days following my brother’s death, the influx of sympathy cards, corn casseroles, news stories, pastoral visits, written obituaries, and floral arrangements all sang in unison, stuck on the same line: “Had a little brother, had a little brother, had a little brother.” \n\nDeath had stolen my song. \n\nDuring the funeral, I stood in the first church pew, ready to lace up my red Keds, kick open the sanctuary doors, and go claim my little brother. I decided it wasn’t too late for it to all be a big mistake. I was waiting for Grief to admit it had chosen the wrong family, for Tragedy to apologize, and for Sorrow to pack its bags. It all made more sense that way, because my brother was the kind of guy who’d blush at all this attention and giggle at the amount of formality. Or was he? I was already forgetting. \n\nMy thoughts are my most unreliable grief companion, with the capacity to be my sweetest advocate or my biggest traitor. Like having a sore muscle, I become afraid to make the next move, knowing that walking through memories has the power to heal, but it also has the power to hurt. \n\nInside the front door of our childhood home, there’s a piano, the bench cushion worn equally on both sides. Together, my brother and I had written our own rendition of “Heart and Soul”—he on the bass clef, me on the treble. I sit in the same spot now, alone, recalling all of my notes perfectly, the duet only heard in my head. I remember all of his notes too. And I’m reminded that I am still Mary Kaitlin, but I no longer have a little brother who lives in my house too. I feel like the psalmist, pounded by the waves:\n\n“Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your breakers and your billows have swept over me. The Lord will send his faithful love by day; his song will be with me in the night— a prayer to the God of my life” (Psalm 42:7–8).\n\nDeath can steal our song, but it cannot stop us from singing. And while I hold onto the hope of heaven, I am relieved and comforted by remembering God’s faithfulness to me in all things, right now.\n\nWhen I hear one of our old songs, sometimes I listen, and other times I don’t. But when I’m feeling brave, I begin to mouth the words of that childhood song about my little brother, and I’m reminded of the true root of my grief: love. And that’s something I’ll never forget. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nI stood with the other guests, sandals planted in the grass, finger pressed to the top of a can of Silly String, waiting in anticipation to see what emerged from the tip of the spout. Blue or pink? Blue or pink? \n\nTime and time again for the previous eighteen months, my husband and I had experienced a similar suspense in the privacy of our own home, waiting for the results. One line or two? One line or two? But there were no shouts of joy or photos taken. No blue Silly String raining down on our heads. Just the sound of plastic hitting the bottom of a trash can as another month closed on our dreams. \n\nAs our friends learned they would soon welcome a baby boy, I grabbed my husband’s hand and dragged him through their master bedroom, bathroom, and into the closet—not totally weird, since this particular gender reveal also doubled as a housewarming party. The place still smelled like paint. In my friends’ walk-in closet, shoes lined shelves on the left and right, all in perfect rows. Without warning, I began to sob, crumbling into my husband’s shoulder, laughing and crying at the same time as I realized I wanted everything they have.\n\nI’m not sure I know how to weep with those who weep and rejoice with those who rejoice. All too often, I do it all backwards, because this life is really, really hard, and I’m just barely keeping it together. I find I’m detached when others weep, never quite sure what to say or how to make it better. And I’m sad to say I’m jealous when others rejoice, disappointed with my own circumstances. \n\nI’m even worse with my own pain, minimizing it because I don’t want to burden other people. Downplaying my successes because I don’t want to seem vain or selfish. And God’s call to walk alongside others in their deepest sorrow and joy seems almost impossible (Romans 12:12–15). So for better or for worse, I fake it the best I can, hoping that someday my feelings will catch up to my actions.\n\nBut I think God wants so much more than for me to ignore my emotions. And He is most definitely not asking me to “fake it ‘til I make it.” He’s calling me to real emotion—to the odd, uncomfortable reality of holding grief and joy at the same time, without minimizing either experience, naming the good, the bad, and the ugly. This means allowing myself to feel the depth of my pain, so that, when the time comes, I will know what it means to grieve with my friends. \n\nBeing honest and vulnerable with our emotions isn’t easy. But ultimately, if we are real with Him—and with each other—every grief and every joy can transform into a glimpse of redemption. If I let it happen, every affliction can give me a greater capacity to care for and understand someone else’s pain. Every joy I allow myself to fully experience can give me a greater capacity to dance at someone else’s wedding.\n\nIn 2017, we brought home our son through adoption; we are writing a new story from many broken pieces. And yet, our journey with infertility is not over. Our bodies still don’t do what others can. But I’m learning that Christ is the ultimate empathizer. No one weeps with us and rejoices with us like He does. “For as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so our comfort overflows through Christ” (2 Corinthians 1:5). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nLifting the hammer up with both hands, I knocked the shelf loose from its fixed position. My screams had become muffled by the sobs caught in my throat, but through shallow breaths and clenched teeth, I made my complaints known and laid into Him.\n\nI want my babies! Where are they? Why do You give them to me if You’re only going to take them away?\n\nAfter our first miscarriage, I wept as I painted our bedroom walls, covering up the sunny yellow and replacing it with a controlled, subdued neutral. The linen closet received a welcome facelift and my wardrobe was purged, streamlined to a more manageable system for daily use. After years of unexplained infertility, I was told to be happy I’d gotten pregnant in the first place. Chin up, Buttercup. Let’s soldier on.\n\nBut this second miscarriage, four months later, was different. I felt utterly unhinged, untethered to anything. Forgotten. And so I drifted violently across the kitchen floor, from cabinet to cabinet and shelf to shelf, re-organizing and reordering, wielding a hammer and railing on my Maker.\n\nYears passed, and I grew numb. Empty. And very sick, it turns out. I found myself in a neurologist’s office with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. What’s more, my doctor discovered an anomaly in my blood work. An autoimmune disease and now an antibody—the doctor believed that together, they’d caused me to miscarry.\n\nHe may have been right. Three months into being on my MS meds, and without trying, I became pregnant with identical twin girls. I laughed out loud as my obstetrician pointed out two fluttering heartbeats on the ultrasound. I laughed, and I promise you, I heard Him laugh too.\n\nPain, loss, and affliction—I know them well. We all do because they’re a promised byproduct of life here in a fallen world (John 16:33). They come tangled up with joy and abundance and blessing. I’ve tried to extricate the good from the seemingly bad, but to no avail. They’re a packaged deal.\n\nSo while my dream of having children has been realized, and then some, I still have multiple sclerosis. Now, being well enough to keep up with our girls the way I’d always imagined is a struggle, a deep shame I do battle with daily.\n\nThis is my Ebenezer: my affliction, healing, and blessing bound together in a monument to Him and for His glory (Genesis 35:14; 1 Samuel 7:3–12). It’s here that I’ve wrestled with my God and have come to know Him face to face. I cannot praise Him and thank Him for our girls without praising and thanking Him for my diagnosis of MS. Learning to do so will no doubt take a lifetime. \n\nHe’s chosen to weave great joy into deep sorrow. This forces me to wonder if my affliction and physical limitations are somehow God’s kindness to me (2 Corinthians 12:5–10)—constant reminders that my body, this temporal world, and everything in it are fading away. Meanwhile, the eternal wages on, refreshed and renewed, out in the open air and light of His presence. “Therefore we do not give up. Even though our outer person is being destroyed, our inner person is being renewed day by day” (2 Corinthians 4:16).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nI was once a well-oiled working machine, churning out articles, speaking at conferences, ministering within my capacity and out of my weaknesses and strengths. While I’d never envisioned myself as an unmarried woman, I found fullness and contentment in the plot God had given me to tend.\n\nThen I got married. And moved. And moved again. I’m no longer in my home, or church, or comfort zone. I still don’t really know anyone here, and we haven’t found a local church home in the D.C. area yet. We feel displaced.\n\nMeanwhile, all the work that’s been done in me and through me is suddenly no longer for me. I can’t write about singleness anymore. I’ve begun to see others picking up the banner I laid down for the gift of marriage—and I’ve resented myself for losing it. My heart echoes King Solomon’s words: \n\n“I hated all my work that I labored at under the sun because I must leave it to the one who comes after me. And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will take over all my work that I labored at skillfully under the sun. This too is futile” (Ecclesiastes 2:18–19).\n\nThere is this sadness in me that I cannot shake. The earthly identity I worked hard to build, and tried my best to bear faithfully, is no longer mine to carry. Those days of fruitful ministry feel very far behind me across the chasm of this difficult year. The enemy loves to taunt me, to tell me I’ve wasted and been wasted, that all those words and thoughts are now lost. It’s hard to trust that my previous work has not been done in vain, though I know it was never mine to begin with. It was always His. \n\nI dreamt of this time for years, didn’t I? I longed to be married. Why then is it so hard to reconcile the work I once did with the work I’m called to now? I agonize over how to spend the eleven-hour days stretching from the still-dark hours through sunset when my husband returns. I sweep the kitchen floor, wash the towels, and put fresh flowers in the vase, growing weary and resentful of all I’ve lost, straining to remember that I’ve also gained. Happy as my husband and I are together, happy as I am to be called his wife, this place in life is still not our true home. It isn’t supposed to be. \n\nToday I do four loads of laundry. I sweep the kitchen floor. I write. I text Nate and our friends to tell them I love them, that I’m praying for them. I heed King Solomon’s words: “Whatever your hands find to do, do with all your strength” (Ecclesiastes 9:10). But in my struggle as a new stay-at-home wife, I remember that work is still work, no matter the title, no matter how blessed. God explained this to Adam at the fall, that the work of his hands would be hard from then on (Genesis 3:17). And it still is, for all of us. It will be until the day in Glory when pain in all its forms is no more (Revelation 21:4). \n\nSometimes the days drag on, the work feels endless. I can’t sort through the mountain of to-dos quickly enough, and yet it feels like I’m searching for things to do with my hands. But this is the plot to which I am called today: this home, this house, this husband. It is a life both better and harder than I imagined, and it’s being redeemed by God with every light and heavy step along the way. “For it is God who is working in [us] both to will and to work according to his good purpose” (Philippians 2:13).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nSome moments have a ripple effect. As a thrown stone breaks the glassy surface of water causing rings to swell and radiate to the shore, some moments break through us and the ripples radiate for days, months, even a lifetime.\n\nYears ago, a distinguished professor who’d been visiting our church agreed to come lead our small group for the evening. I don’t remember his initial topic that night, but as we lingered in conversation, the discussion soon turned to his travels, specifically his time in India. Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the crushing poverty and mind-boggling crowds of men and women and their children, begging in the streets all around him. His voice trembled as he described the enormity of human suffering he’d witnessed there. The heartbreaking stories he shared left mental images of miles of poverty and millions of suffering souls.\n\nAfter the meeting, I pulled the professor aside and confessed how utterly overwhelmed I was after hearing his stories. I shared how I’d been strangely burdened by the concept of suffering since I was a young girl. “How can this be?” I asked him. “Where is God in the midst of all this? And how on earth can we even begin to enter in and respond to such enormous injustice and suffering?”\n\nThe mild-mannered, soft-spoken professor snapped his head toward me, his eyes piercing and focused. “No,” he declared. “Being overwhelmed by suffering is no excuse for doing nothing.” He explained that there will always be more need than we can meet. But that does not mean we aren’t called to enter in and do the things we are able to do right now. His words landed hard. They felt like a rebuke because they were. To be paralyzed by the harsh reality of suffering, to be stuck inwardly condemning global injustice while doing nothing to alleviate it, is not an option God gives us.\n\nGod doesn’t sugarcoat the pain and brokenness of the world. He calls out evil, suffering, and injustice (Proverbs 6:16–19). He shines a light on those who are lonely, abandoned, oppressed, and poor (James 1:27). He knows the desperation, the dire circumstances, and the darkness we encounter, both in global proportions and in our most intimate and personal daily struggles (Psalm 139:12). Our God knows we need rescue. And Christ scandalously declares, \n\n“The Spirit of the Lord is on me,  because He has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners  and recovery of sight for the blind,  to release the oppressed,  to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.” -Luke 4:18–19\n\nBecause He has solidarity with us, we can offer solidarity to the hurting.Because He defends us, we can defend others.Because He is our ultimate Judge, we can fight for justice.Because He is our hope, we can hold on to hope for ourselves and extend it to others.\n\nChrist entered in to rescue us. And the ripple effect of that rescue goes on and on. Thanks be to God alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI didn’t adopt because I wanted to make orphans miserable. But in the bumpy jostle of daily family life, between Don’t wake the baby! and Everyone get in bed!, I feel like I’m failing. We pursued adoption because we wanted to help—we wanted to make the world a better place, to shine the light of the gospel. But I didn’t know I would need to shine the light of the gospel at 5am, every day, for so many years. In the process, my flashlight has grown dull and weak.\n\nEvery day, my husband and I feel the pendulum swing between the tension of Christ’s invitation to “come away by yourselves to a remote place and rest for a while,” and His admonition to “meet together” in fellowship (Mark 6:31; Hebrews 10:25). After one too many family activities ending in disaster, we’ve learned to let our wounds heal in private and decline the next dinner invitation. \n\nAdoptive parenting has been the most difficult task of my life. It’s been astonishingly isolating, because from the outside, we look like an adorable, bustling, young family. But underneath, I’m clenching my teeth, waiting for the shoe to drop and the next terrible thing to happen. During this season, we’ve felt the tension of pulling out of community activities, playdates, dinners, and visits with family. And I fear that folks won’t understand we are dealing with more than just a case of the wiggles.\n\nBut in pulling away from community, we miss out on the real, loving, encouragement and affirmation we need from our people. We imagine disapproval in their eyes and judgment on their brows. Again and again, I have wanted to hide our messy family life because I am sure no one will understand. \n\nOne May day just a few years ago, my very, very cute adopted son was singing—with perfect pitch—a Christmas song, while I stood in the checkout line at Goodwill. He has a face like a chipmunk and a voice like a chorister, and he knows it. He’d been singing that song for weeks, and now he was shining his face around to draw the attention and approval of the other adults standing nearby. His endless fishing for applause from strangers touches on my fear that he’s still not quite settled on us as his parents; he’s still interviewing for the position. \n\nAlthough we can never erase the brokenness that led to his birth parents’ inability to raise him, we are the parents that God has given him. In spite of my commitment to love him, his singing was exhausting and painful at the end of a draining day—on top of six wearying years. For me, his song felt like a jarring syncopation, rattling out the death of my dreams. I asked him to stop singing.\n\nAt my left elbow, a woman snorted and leaned away from me. “That sweet little boy wasn’t hurting anything. You should know better than to stop him from singing!” she admonished, shaking her head and looking away. I felt my tired shoulders slump lower, even more resolved to hide our troubled story.\n\nAnd we have found relief and safety in solitude. We’ve been able to rally our forces and find heart for the next fight. But pulling away from community robs us of its gifts, and neglecting solitude robs us of its replenishing powers.\n\nSo we live in the in-between tension of the two. We live like a child on a swing, swaying out a little further and retreating a little further, learning to trust our community and learning to accept the peace of solitude.The further we venture out, the deeper we need to retreat afterward. We don’t have an easy solution, but I am sure about which direction to look for hope. “Come to Me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest,” Jesus says (Matthew 11:28). But in this in-between, our hearts are broken every single day. We are rejected and we are befriended. We are lonely and we are loved.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nLast week, my friend Jonathan and I were exchanging messages on Instagram. He recently moved to Austin, Texas, and I was eager to hear stories of good fortune that would render such a gutsy move successful. “Are you seeing lots of fruit in your new life?” I asked. As soon as I’d asked the question, my expectations felt too narrow. I wanted “fruit” to mean visible, positive affirmation of the right choice. Instead of answering directly, Jonathan shared some meandering thoughts typical of his introspective personality. “There’s never enough fruit to me. I heard Matthew McConaughey say that Austinites should focus on contributing more than consuming. I think he nailed it.” \n\nMy friend then put the question back on me: “So, how would you define fruit?” I was grateful for the push-back but also low-grade irritated—mostly because I didn’t feel like using my brain that late in the day. Now I had to confront, and possibly deconstruct, what I thought I meant, because my friend was just shrewd enough (and kind enough) not to leave me holding onto a half-baked idea.\n\nJesus loved a good, piercing question. Certainly, some of them were rhetorical, leaving people in a tongue-tied state like the ancient Near Eastern version of a mic drop. Some of them required a response right then and there. All of them were meant to go straight for the heart. “Who do the people say the Son of Man is?” Jesus asked His disciples while in Caesarea Philippi (Matthew 16:13). \n\nAt the time, there were lots of rumors about who Jesus was: John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah (v.14). The disciples knew from the Prophets that the Messiah would have a “vast” dominion and establish a kingdom with “justice and righteousness” (Isaiah 9:7), but they didn’t know how this would play out specifically. \n\nJesus didn’t ask the disciples who people thought the Son of Man was because He needed to know. It was a tool for unearthing His second question: “But you… who do you say that I am?” (Matthew 16:15). In the end, it doesn’t matter what everybody else thinks. Each of us must answer Jesus’s question for ourselves.\n\nSimon Peter was convinced that Jesus was the Messiah, “the Son of the living God” (v.16), and Scripture tells us that he didn’t just get the answer right by chance. It was the Father, not “flesh and blood,” that had done its work in Peter and revealed this divine knowledge (v.17). \n\nI’m so grateful for Jesus—and for thoughtful friends on Instagram—who ask penetrating questions that have our best interests in mind. Ones that weed out hearsay, clichés, and half-truths to get to the important questions somewhere below. I’m grateful that our Lord is always most concerned with our one-on-one relationship with Him and longs for us to seek and trust His voice above all others.\n\n“So, how do you define bearing fruit?” “Who do you say that I am?”\n\nThese questions lead to the type of knowledge and divine connections that Christ is building His beautiful Church upon.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nMy sister and I hopped onto the genetic-testing train last year. For Christmas, we gave our parents test kits and joined over twelve million customers in search of our ancestry. We are a people fascinated by our origins, hungry for the past to shed light on our present. \n\nFamily heritage held deep, sacred meaning for ancient Jewish people as well. While the modern identity question is, “Who am I?”, the defining question of ancient Israel was, “Whose am I?” Just read the detailed genealogies in the Old Testament. From Abraham to Ruth to David—origins, birthrights, and family connections formed identity and destiny. \n\nSo, it’s no wonder that Jesus’s listeners confidently held out their status as Abraham’s descendants and flashed it as their badge of honor and worth. Yet this over-dependence on heritage was dangerous. It offered a false sense of security, a misguided sense of racial superiority, and spiritual blindness.\n\nOne of Jesus’s disciples, John, records how many Jews were in denial of their need for rescue. They would not accept Jesus’s controversial teaching, which told them that even they, God’s chosen people, were spiritually lost and in desperate need of a Savior. When told that the truth would set them free, they bristled and held up their heritage as proof of their right standing with God. They told Jesus, “We are Abraham’s descendants… and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say, ‘You will become free’?” (John 8:33).\n\nJesus does more than poke holes in their heritage badges. He blasts the shaky ground they are standing on and reveals the true, firm foundation that provides the only way of salvation. Ancestry does not determine identity and destiny. But there is something—Someone—who does. And so Jesus answers them: “Truly I tell you, before Abraham was, I am” (v.58). \n\nBoom! His Jewish challengers are no doubt shocked by His outrageous claims. How could this man say these things? Jesus is equating Himself with Yahweh, leaving no room for misunderstanding. This man from Nazareth has the audacity to echo the words of God, who spoke to Moses through a burning bush and revealed His own name, “I AM WHO I AM” (Exodus 3:14). They know exactly what Jesus is claiming—that He, not a bloodline from Abraham, is the way of salvation and true freedom. \n\nWe, too, should be stunned, jolted by Jesus’s words. They are scandalous. But our family tree and our connections don’t define us. What we do, where we come from, who we associate with—none of these things can make us right with God. This is personal, and this is cosmic. We need a rescue from outside of ourselves, what theologian Martin Luther called an “alien righteousness.”\n\n“For this reason God highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,  so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow—in heaven and on earth and under the earth— and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father” (Philippians 2:9–11). \n\nWe do have a sure identity, which means we also have a sure destiny. The risen Christ defines us as beloved children of God, and we are destined to have a place around His table, dwelling with Him forever. He is our firm foundation. He is our righteousness. He sets us free. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nIn the whimsical, little village of Carmel-by-the-Sea, there’s a restaurant called Forge in the Forest. And, yes, it looks exactly like it sounds. It has a courtyard reminiscent of Disneyland’s Pixie Hollow, full of creeping vines and flowers and string lights. One of my students had recommended the place in a food review, so my friend and I pretty much planned our whole trip around having dinner there. After a day of sightseeing and beach-combing, we were way beyond that point of hunger in which you can barely form cohesive sentences. So, as you can imagine, we were giddy after ordering bacon burgers, a balsamic beet salad the size of a hoola-hoop, and chocolate lava cake garnished with raspberries. Of that meal, all I can say is, “Praise God from whom all blessings flow”—I’ll just leave it at that.\n\nBefore Jesus feeds the five thousand near the Sea of Galilee, He notices the crowd’s physical needs. “Where will we buy bread so that these people can eat?” he asks Philip (John 6:5). Once the disciples spot a young boy with food, Jesus uses five barley loaves and some fish to nourish the crowd’s physical hunger. He knew they wouldn’t be able to listen well if they were starving. This meal was an act of care and an entryway into relationship, where He would begin to nourish them spiritually.\n\nIn fact, providing above and beyond for this crowd was enough to convince them that Jesus was, in fact, the Messiah. When they saw this miracle, they said, “This truly is the Prophet who is to come into the world” (v.14). Throughout Scripture, bread is a common motif used to demonstrate God’s provision and sustenance—whether that’s the Israelites’ “bread from heaven” in the desert (v.31) or a mountainside meal. Jesus goes as far as to tell the disciples that He is the bread of life (v.35). \n\nOne of the earliest heresies in the church was the belief that the spiritual realm is good while the material world is evil. But we live in fragile bodies that have needs, and the way of Jesus is distinctly earthy. He walked along the dirt and fed people with fish and broke bread to symbolize His own body (Luke 22:19). Jesus doesn’t neglect the physical world for the spiritual world. This place we live in—a world with cinnamon bark and praying mantises and fresh basil—is the setting God created for us to encounter Him. \n\nWe have physical needs and spiritual needs, and Jesus offers to meet these while teaching us a higher way of living. Although our physical needs are great, Jesus is the nourishment that sustains us far beyond just alleviating our hunger pangs. How kind of Him to offer Himself in a way that makes little sense to us on one level, yet is exactly what we need Him to be: our “bread of life” (John 6:35), the only sustenance we will every truly need.\n\nAlthough there wasn’t anything particularly spiritual about that meal at Forge in the Forest, I felt God’s pleasure as I ate it. The same God who designs intricate plant life so that we can garnish our cake with raspberries also gave Himself up for us out of love. May we always remember that. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nDon’t get me wrong—I love the change of seasons and readily welcome autumn, but when summer begins to deflate, I want to grab on to every last drop. And then, when we begin losing daylight at a rate of two minutes per day (ugh!), I am absolutely done for. Shorter, colder days force us to come inside early and remember what it’s like to live in the darkness. Am I the only one who’s still a little afraid of the dark? \n\nYou and I both know we’re not strangers to the darkness. We see it every day, in every season. It’s in our conflicts and our diagnoses, our best intentions and our hurt feelings. Maybe winter feels harder because it’s just a stark, visual reflection of our sinful reality. Left to our own devices, we are people wandering in darkness (Isaiah 9:2). Since the fall in the garden, we have all been scrounging around in the pitch-black of our sin and shame, our souls in danger of never truly seeing light again.\n\nBut here’s what I love about the gospel: Just as we sometimes see a visual representation of the sinful nature of our souls, God gives us an everlasting image of redemption and hope in His Son, Jesus. In the Gospel of John, we read:\n\n“Jesus spoke to them again: “‘I am the light of the world. Anyone who follows me will never walk in the darkness but will have the light of life’” (John 8:12).\n\nLet’s jump in with a little bit of context here: Jesus is speaking to a crowd that included Jewish religious leaders. He is in the temple complex, and the Feast of Tabernacles is taking place. The Jews had been debating His identity because of the miracles people had seen and the authority with which He spoke. And now Jesus gives them one more outrageous statement to debate: “I am the light of the world.”\n\nLight was an important symbol in the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles (Leviticus 23:33–44), signifying the pillar of fire given to Israel during the exodus (Exodus 13:21). But here in John chapter 8, Jesus is saying that He Himself is the light given to His children, illuminating the way to eternal life. His declaration is for us as well. \n\nNow, we, as beloved children of Christ, have seen the great light of life set before us. Let us hold on to Him, our only sure hope in the midst of darkness. He is our light in this life and our eternal salvation, our stronghold in the face of all fear and dread (Psalm 27:1). May He awaken us from the darkness of our sin and our slumber of ambivalence (Ephesians 5:13–14).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "I Am the Gate for the Sheep",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nSheep don’t know a gate from a fence row. As a midwestern sheep farmer, I can tell you this for certain. A recent run-in with a wayward sheep proves my point. Because the proverbial grass is always greener on the other side, our sheep are constantly stretching their necks to try to nibble the grass outside the fence. Occasionally, one will barrel through the wire to get to the “good stuff” she’s been denied.\n\nSo it was that we discovered one of our sheep outside the pen one hot day this summer. The solution should have been easy. We simply opened the gate. But due to stubbornness or oblivion, the ewe remained outside the fold. We called and whooped, summoning her back to the comfort and safety of her flock. Instead, she kept ramming herself into the fence. Time and time again. The gate was wide open, but she defaulted to futile attempts to make her own way.\n\nCreation is constantly teaching us (Romans 1:20), and when it comes to revealing who Jesus is, sheep are especially good instructors. No wonder Jesus frequently asked us to envision sheep pens as He revealed His identity as “the gate for the sheep” (John 10:7). Long before Jesus spoke these words, David, once a shepherd, saw the character of the Lord (and his own identity) illustrated through his flock: “The LORD is my shepherd; I have what I need” (Psalm 23:1).\n\nThe theme woven throughout Scripture is this: we are like sheep, prone to wander from the fold in search of false hope that can never fully satisfy. Because our Shepherd is good, the gate to salvation is open, but we’ll never find it on our own. We try to be self-sufficient, to do all the good deeds, and we may even convince ourselves for a time that we’ve got our stuff together more than someone else. But the reality is, when left to our own devices, we will just keep ramming ourselves up against false hope and good intentions.\n\nJesus shows us the gate—no, actually, Jesus is the gate. He is the way. Listen for His call. Submit to His leading. Quit stubbornly ramming yourself up against your own plans. Instead, look to Jesus and enter in. He whispers to us, “I am the gate. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will come in and go out and find pasture” (John 10:9).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Guest Writer\n\nSometimes a song undoes me. Certain lyrics and melodies have a way of releasing the yearnings of my heart. So it is with these words from Robert Robinson’s hymn, “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing”: “Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it. / Prone to leave the God I love.” \n\nMy wandering makes me ache. \n\nIs it any wonder that God’s people are called sheep so often in the Bible? Sheep need a shepherd. Without guidance, they easily wander and become lost. Don’t we also veer off into uncharted territory and become disoriented? Our agendas, worries, and unbelief all lead us away from dependence on Jesus, and soon we don’t know which way to turn. \n\nSheep need a protector. It is dangerous for them to stray from their shepherd’s care. Unlike animals with sharp claws or speedy legs, sheep are vulnerable and defenseless. If left alone, they will likely be attacked and killed by wild animals. \n\nWe, too, have a predator, an enemy of our souls. Scripture tells us to “be sober-minded, be alert. Your adversary the devil is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for anyone he can devour” (1 Peter 5:8). We need a Shepherd to guide us, keep us in the fold, and protect us from our enemy.\n\nSheep also need a provider. They often cannot find clean water or nourishing grass on their own. They struggle to care for themselves. If sheep stumble and fall over, they cannot get back up and will die on the ground with their short legs sticking up in the air. \n\nWhen faced with our own suffering and confusion, we also can find ourselves wrestling in the dusty dirt of life, struggling to get back on our feet. Like sheep, we need a Shepherd to make us lie down in green pastures and rest, to lead us beside quiet waters and renew us (Psalm 23:2–3).\n\nDavid wrote the poetry of Psalm 23, and he intimately understood shepherding. As a boy, he tended his father’s sheep (1 Samuel 16:1–13). As King of Israel, he shepherded a nation. And in the midst of his own wandering, he wrestled in the dirt of his sin and brokenness, and realized just how desperately he needed a Shepherd (2 Samuel 11, Psalm 51).\n\nThrough the words of His prophet, Ezekiel, God graciously promises, “I myself will search for my flock and look after them” (Ezekiel 34:11). Jesus boldly echoes His Father and reveals His divine identity as He declares, “I am the good shepherd” who “lays down his life for the sheep” (John 10:11). \n\nLike David, Jesus lovingly tends his Father’s sheep. Like David, Jesus wrestled in the dirt of sin—but it wasn’t His sin. It was ours. Jesus conquered sin and death, just as John the Baptist boldly proclaimed He would: “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29) The Good Shepherd willingly became the ultimate sacrificial Lamb to atone for our sin and make the way for His people to be right with God, to bring His sheep safe within the fold.\n\nYes, I ache when I wander. But I also rejoice when I recognize my Shepherd’s voice. Jesus said, “My sheep hear my voice, I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27). His words ring true. His voice undoes me. What a Good Shepherd, what a Savior!\n\n",

    "devo_title": "I Am the Resurrection and the Life",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nThis past summer, I attended the SING! Conference, hosted by Keith and Kristyn Getty. While there, I heard Joni Eareckson Tada cast a vision for what the resurrection must mean for the physically and mentally disabled. She shared how the first thing she hoped to do in heaven after regaining the use of her legs was to kneel before God. This was because, growing up in church traditions that made space for confessional kneeling, she was not able to participate in this part of the liturgy, although her confidence in God’s goodness was obvious. I believe the resurrection, which means a literal “raising up,” has a secondary layer of beauty for those who cannot raise themselves physically now. \n\nWhen Martha confesses belief that her brother Lazarus will rise again on the last day, Jesus tells her that He is “the resurrection and the life” (John 11:25). Although Martha already believed in the coming resurrection, she didn’t appear to fully understand that Christ Himself was the embodiment of it. I imagine this is why Jesus explains how those who believe in Him will live on even after death and asks her: “Do you believe this?” (v.26).\n\nThe idea of Jesus raising her brother from the dead that day was almost too good to be true for Martha. It was a big ask. Her cheeks still wet with tears of grief, she knew that she would see her brother again, but it felt like hoping against hope that Jesus would revive his breath when so many others didn’t get that privilege. Four days in, surely Lazarus was gone (v.17). \n\nTo Martha, the resurrection at the end of history was a detached concept. It provided her with hope, but only a futuristic hope that barely touched her present grief. Jesus surprised her by bringing her brother back to life with the simple command of “Lazarus, come out!” (v.44).\n\nOne of my best friends told me once that “Truth is a Man.” It’s always stuck with me. Although, for some, Christianity may just be a system of strung together theological concepts (our human attempt to understand God), the center of the gospel is the person of Jesus Christ—who has skin and bones. Our whole faith history, before and after the incarnation, must now be interpreted through that earth-shattering event. This Man, who is also fully God, has the power to resurrect all things—our physical bodies and hearts and even the empty places that don’t have a name. \n\nWhether, like Joni Earechson Tada, you’re one of the walking wounded who feel stuck or held back by physical and mental disadvantages, or you simply feel the toll of being human, the hope of the resurrection is that it is here, now—because He is here, now. Because Christ is in us, the same Spirit’s power that raised Him from the dead is in us, too (Romans 8:11). What a crazy and humbling thought that is. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\n“What are you looking for?” seems like a harmless question when you’re, say, on all fours looking for the back of an earring in a crowded elevator. Or maybe when your bike has been stolen and you’re filling out a police report detailing its exact size, color, and last known location.\n\nBut when it comes to something you’ve never had before, like a dream job or a new friend, it can be hard to articulate exactly what you’re hoping to find. What I know for sure is that every time I sit across from an attractive, intelligent man on a first date, I dread them asking, “So… what are you looking for?” What I’ve figured out is that the question beneath the question is actually, “Is it me?” And no… it’s not terrifying or too soon to be asking that question on a first date—nope, not all.\n\nWhat I find interesting, though, is that this question, this posture of seeking, is ingrained in us. Ever since the fall, humanity has found itself lacking, and thus, we have found ourselves searching for who knows what: Chocolate. Caffeine. Ibuprofen. Adventure. Love. Fulfillment. Belonging. Healing. Our need is not a surprise to us. \n\nI don’t think that any of God’s children would have been able to specifically ask for who we need as a Savior. Sure, we would’ve been able to come up with characteristics, such as someone who is “forgiving” or “loving” or even someone who is “just” in the way they interact with the world and others. But our minds are unable to understand just how great our need is, let alone the compassion and longing God has for us. He had more in store for us than just fulfilling our needs—He wanted to do so in a way that would teach us about His character, draw us to His love, and keep us in His embrace forever. \n\nAs His disciples encountered Jesus while feeling their own human needs, they probably had a lot of questions come to mind:\n\nWhich way is right? What can I believe to be absolutely true? How can I find real life in a fallen world? \n\nJesus answers our fears with this calming reassurance in the beginning of John 14: “Don’t let your heart be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me” (v.1). He is capable of showing us the way, revealing to us the truth, and giving us life abundantly—and that would have been enough, more than we deserve. But He still wants more for us. He wants us to know Him in relationship. \n\nI love what Charles Spurgeon has to say about the way Jesus talks to His disciples here: “Thus we notice how they speak to him with a natural, easy familiarity; and he talks to them in full sympathy with their weakness, teaching them little by little as they are able to learn. They ask just such questions as a boy might ask of his father. Often they show their ignorance, but never do they seem timid in his presence, or ashamed to let him see how shallow and hard of understanding they are.”\n\nJesus knows what we are searching for, even when we don’t have a clue. When we ask, “Where is the path? What is true? How can I find life?”, He will always answer, “It is me.” He alone is “the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebekah Lyons\n\nA few Septembers ago, one lazy afternoon during Shabbat, I strolled along a path through a biblical garden in Israel. We’d been there for a week, staying at that gorgeous kibbutz overlooking the Emmaus road, inspired by the garden and the community that lived and worked there.\n\nAs I walked alone, the wind picked up from the east, fast and furious. I stopped in my tracks, as if Jesus were about to stroll around the bend, white robe and hair flowing, to offer me a bear hug. A girl can dream, yes? Minutes later, my eyes landed on a branch dangling in front of me; I was standing beneath a grape arbor canopied with a roof of vines overhead. \n\nI looked more closely and noticed a tiny leaf, torn almost in two. At the bottom of the leaf, a green vine had wrapped itself in a ball around the torn part, binding the tear and holding the leaf close against itself. I got choked up. For years I suffered with panic disorder while living in New York City, and I’d always describe myself as “untethered,” flailing and fleeting like that torn leaf.\n\nI ran to gather the rest of my group, to show them this gift of analogy. Our guide, Arie, joined us with bright eyes and zeal, eager for any teachable moment. He shared that the nature of the vine when it touches something, is to begin wrapping itself around it, making them one.\n\nThat year, I’d been reading Dutch missionary Andrew Murray’s book, Abide in Christ, excavating my soul and learning how this vine-and-branch thing works. My encounter with the little vine that day reminded me of this passage from Murray’s book: “My entire life, I thought my closeness with Jesus was dependent upon me. But Jesus’s love draws us in for one thing: to come into His presence and His rest. That’s it. How many of us could use a little soul rest? And when we do come, the Vine takes the reins from there; He pulls us close and tethers us to Himself.” \n\nThe greatness doesn’t stop there. This tethering becomes provision, meaning all the nutrients of heaven are offered to us right now, to renew us and bring us back to life. Jesus gives us everything we need in life to push back the darkness (2 Peter 1:3). He is “the true vine” who gently binds us to Himself (John 15:1). He brings forth fruit, grown from the life He’s given us, to then bring nourishment to the world. Jesus does it all. Fruit never comes from our own making—it grows to the measure we let Him grow it in us (v.5). \n\nWhat a beautiful relief! The old covenant was about what we bring to Him—our annual offering, our covering of sin to become restored with God—but the new covenant is all about what Jesus brings to us. His offering. His blood to cover our sin. His righteousness credited to us, declaring us right with God. May we stop striving today and rest in the grip of the Vine’s loving-kindness.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nAge has taught me that I don’t need a smaller view of my problems—I need a bigger view of God. Few truths comfort me more than the fact that God is infinite. He extends indefinitely in all directions; past and present, before and behind. Though the thought is truly mind boggling, Scripture is clear: He has always been. \n\nGod has no beginning, no point of origin. There was no “before” Him. There can never be an “after.” No one breathed life into His lungs, and no one can take His life from Him. “He is before all things, and by him all things hold together” (Colossians 1:17). He is both the first and the last (Isaiah 44:6). He is “the Alpha and the Omega… the beginning and the end” (Revelation 22:13). He was and He is, and is He coming again (Revelation 1:4).\n\nThough God created time, He stands outside of it. Since my finite mind cannot grasp His expanse, I like to think of Him like a paper-towel-roll God. Go ahead, grab the empty paper towel roll from your kitchen counter to see what I mean. Hold it up. Look at it from end to end and consider this: This is God’s view of our lives. \n\nThe Alpha and Omega existed before us. He will exist long after our earthly days are done. He can effortlessly see our lives from beginning to end, like glancing through a cardboard tube. This means our infinite God stands outside of temporary troubles. There is no heartache that can outlast Him, and no hurt He wasn’t around to see.\n\nBut as vast and incomprehensible as our Creator God is, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to put on flesh and dwell with us, to die for us, and to save us from sin and death. “He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation… all things have been created through him and for him” (Colossians 1:15–16).\n\nA bigger view of God turns my heart toward worshiping Him. That worship often boomerangs back as peace within my own heart. Every fear and worry we will face today, every insult and besetting sin—everything is fleeting. The things of this world are already circling the drain. Our lives are just a blip on the timeline of eternity, yet each of us matters to Him, our Creator. God, in contrast, is the end-all-be-all, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. Today we can rest in His goodness and constancy. We can rest in His power and His “bigness,” and that is no small thing.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nI was five years old, standing with my mom and brother in a pew near the front of the sanctuary. We were singing a hymn and I had my eyes closed, my hands held in front of me with my palms facing up as if carrying an invisible tray. This is my earliest memory of worship. \n\nI didn’t know to call it that. I was just responding to the reality of who God showed Himself to be. Somehow—maybe through the Scripture read from the pulpit or a truth proclaimed in that hymn, or maybe through whispers from the Holy Spirit to my heart—I caught a glimpse of God, big and strong and holy, but also good and loving. I felt connected to Him, like I knew Him and He knew me. It didn’t matter that I was small; I knew right then that I was His, and my heart responded in kind. \n\nThat moment in my memory marks the beginning of a lifelong journey of worship, of learning to respond to God with all of myself. There are times this resembles that day in the church pew, my heart swelling in worship as the pipe organ plays and the congregation sings. More often it takes a subtler form, a different shape of surrender for each circumstance and season. Sometimes my worship is misplaced; like a train without tracks, I give my awe and reverence to something other than my Creator. \n\nScripture makes it clear that we are to worship nothing and no one other than the one true God. He is the only one worthy of our worship. \n\n“To whom will you compare me, or who is my equal?” asks the Holy One. Look up and see! Who created these? He brings out the stars by number; he calls all of them by name. Because of his great power and strength, not one of them is missing.” –Isaiah 40:25–26\n\nBut if worship is indeed more than singing on Sunday morning, what is it? Jesus told the Samaritan woman at the well that true worshipers worship “in Spirit and in truth” (John 4:23). How do we worship with a heart tuned to the Spirit of the Lord and tethered to the truth of His Word? \n\nThese are the questions we will explore in this study of what it means to worship God. Each day we will read about an aspect of worship from Scripture, spending time reflecting on what it looks like in our lives. While these two weeks will not give us an exhaustive look at the topic of worship in the Bible, our prayer is that we’ll walk away with a fuller understanding of what “worship in spirit and in truth” means for us and the God who made us. \n\nLike that little girl with hands stretched out, I am still learning how to worship. Join me as we learn together, and may our lives reflect more of God’s goodness and glory as a result. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Worship Through Song",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sandra McCracken\n\nMy emotions have been a bit up and down lately. I’ve been writing songs in fits and starts, leaving chords and scribbled notes in papers on the piano, unfinished and forgotten. This is an especially dynamic time for our family as we have recently welcomed a new baby. But as we shift into this new season of life, I find I am once again comforted by chords and lyrics, by the act of praising and worshiping God through them. I find rest when I call to mind these words from the psalmist: “For the word of the LORD is right and true; he is faithful in all he does” (Psalm 33:4 NIV). Our God has made all things with His own hands, and with every new season and turning of our lives, He invites us to sing a new song to Him.\n\nIn the midst of all these changes, I try to live in the moment, to be present and take it all in stride. But the thing about living in the moment is that it’s wrapped up in the weather, the mood I’m in, what I ate for lunch, how much sleep I’ve had, or how stressed I am about work obligations. Emotions are the fuel and the energy of our daily rhythms; they provide the movement of our lives. Created by God, our emotions are good and can teach us things about who we are, who our God is, and who our neighbor is; however, in and of themselves, our emotions are not trustworthy and ought not be left in charge to guide our lives. This is where worship can come into play.\n\nWorship can lasso the wild horses of shame, gladness, anger, loneliness, and sadness and then corral them inside the fence of truth. Worship is restorative; it is the corrective to our emotional ups and downs. It turns the disharmony of our circumstances into the resonant harmonies of a new song. Worship is not just about living in the moment; it is an honest look at who we are in light of who God is, of where we’ve been and where we are going. \n\nThrough worship and song, God invites us into a deeper relationship with Him. He reveals more of Himself through the act of worship, and as a result, our spirits, minds, and bodies are realigned to His reality—not what we perceive our circumstances to be through the lens of emotion. God provides and sustains in all things, and He teaches us to sing new songs of praise, new ways to worship Him within each new twist and turn of life, in times of both joy and sorrow.\n\nThere’s an old gospel hymn that says, “I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free.” But when we go through times of difficulty or transition that are disorientating, how do we keep worshiping? When awakened in the middle of the night with a newborn baby, or rising in the morning after a break-up, or standing on the grass at a loved one’s funeral, or in the slow delays of a long illness—how do we keep on singing?\n\nIt takes faith to believe in what we cannot see, to sing ourselves forward into hope. Worship is the practice of faith, of aligning our spirits with God’s kingdom reality; singing is what comes out on the other side. These words seem to spring up out of a deep well of gratitude within the psalmist, who says, “Hallelujah! How good it is to sing to our God” (Psalm 147:1).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Worship Through Service",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Maria Furlough\n\nHave you ever wrestled with what it means to serve? In my own life, I’ve found it’s far easier to seek out what’s fun or brings comfort. Life gets tiring and stressful, and the only way we can survive is by putting something “fun” on the calendar, something to look forward to. Our family does this, and I don’t believe there is anything wrong with it. But I wonder if our craving for fun is masking a deeper desire for joy—the kind of fulfillment that comes from serving others.\n\nIn the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says that when He returns He will know who loves Him by the way that we help others: “For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink; I was a stranger and you took me in” (Matthew 25:35).\n\nWe’re tempted to read this verse and say to ourselves, “I need to sign up for a food kitchen” or “I need to give that homeless person a dollar the next time I see them.” These are all good things, sure, but is this the kind of service Jesus is really talking about in this passage?\n\nJesus also said, “For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve” (Mark 10:45). These two passages are bold calls to live our lives wide open to constant, regular, and sacrificial acts of laying our lives down for others. Jesus’s words beckon us to worship Him not through obligatory service, but with guttural prayers asking the Lord to allow us opportunities to love in His name. \n\nWhy does Jesus ask this of us? Jesus loves us, came to die for us, and knows that the only way for us to have the full, free, and joy-filled life that we so deeply desire is through the laying down our lives for others (John 15:13).\n\nWhat does this look like? It might look like embracing an interruption in our already busy day. Or perhaps it looks like bravely praying that God would send someone your way to love in His name. It might look like asking Him to reveal opportunities to worship Him through service to others. Maybe you’re called to embrace the uncomfortable and not shy away from that call because you are afraid of the unknown. \n\nWhen we create margin in our lives to serve others, we realize that any sacrifices we make to worship God in this way—whether it be through our time, resources, or creativity—all pale in comparison to the joy we receive as a result.\n\nI pray that today, God would show us ways we can serve as Jesus served, and that the joy that wells up when we do would create an unquenchable desire for more!\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Worship Through Obedience",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kimberly Girard\n\nIf we believe all of God’s Word is true, then we must receive even the hard things as being good for us. This means these words from the psalmist are true as well:\n\nThe precepts of the LORD are right, making the heart glad; the command of the LORD is radiant, making the eyes light up. \n–Psalm 19:8\n\nThe Lord’s commands are “radiant”—brilliant and beaming beacons of light in this world—and this verse tells us they are able to bring us joy. Those words are poetry, yes, but they are also true and applicable. So do we believe them in a practical sense? Do we experience joy from God’s commands? Do we feed and thrive on faithfulness and obedience to God as Daniel did?\n\nFor Daniel, there was no room for discussion about obedience. Even when he knew he’d be thrown into the lion’s den for worshiping the Lord, “three times a day he got down on his knees, prayed, and gave thanks to his God, just as he had done before” (Daniel 6:10). Obedience and worship were a way of life for Daniel, a posture of his heart and indicative of his relationship with God, not just a response to crisis. \n\nIn giving our lives in obedience to the Lord, in doing “everything in the name of the Lord Jesus” (Colossians 3:17), we ascribe worth to God, acknowledging that He alone is worthy of our worship, not only through our words but also through our actions. When we choose to live in accordance with God’s Word and His ways, we submit to His will and die to our own.\n\nLiving as an exile in Babylon most of his life, Daniel knew well that the earth was not his ultimate home, and he lived like it. He lived in obedience and continual service to his King, the Lord of heaven and of earth. Do we live like that? Do our lives look as radically obedient as Daniel’s life? Do the Lord’s commands bring light to our eyes or weight to our hearts? We know theoretically that God’s commands are for our good. But if we’re honest, we’re a wrecked, half-hearted people who worship so many other things with our lives.\n\nBut “the LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love” (Psalm 103:8); He does not leave us to ourselves. While we were still lost to our sin, Jesus Christ came to save us from ourselves, humbling “himself by becoming obedient to the point of death” (Romans 5:8; Philippians 2:7–8). Even now, He is sanctifying us into a people who will worship Him with our whole heart and whole lives in obedience to Him (2 Corinthians 3:18). The One who calls us to obedience gives us everything we need to obey Him (2 Peter 1:3).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nIn college, I was part of a university ministry that had been led in faithfulness by the same pastor for many years, and he still leads it to this day: a picture of steadfast commitment and fruit-bearing that can only come from a long obedience in the same direction (to borrow a book title from the late Eugene Peterson). \n\nThree years ago, we gathered with alumni and supporters to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of this faithful, beloved ministry. We took turns sharing memories and singing hymns, but the wind that blew through the whole evening was one of corporate gratitude: together, thanking God for His indescribable gift, we worshiped in song and story, in thanksgiving and praise. We thanked God for what He had done, and what we knew He would continue to do. \n\nEach of today’s passages from Scripture highlights corporate gratitude expressed in worship. In 1 Chronicles 16, David institutes the daily practice of thanksgiving, commissioning Asaph to lead the community in worship. David decrees his song of thanks in verses 8–36, which is then reflected in parts of Psalms 96, 105, and 106. \n\nThe structure of David’s song matches the content of Psalm 136 incredibly closely, and there’s a lot to be gleaned from what David thanks the Lord for and in what order.\n\nIn Psalm 136, we see the creation story unfold with a refrain about God’s everlasting love: He made the heavens, He spread the land on the water, He hung the sun and the moon and dotted the stars. Then we read, with the same call-and-response pattern, how He saved the Israelites from Egyptian slavery, struck down evil kings to protect His people, and gave them a homeland. The same themes leap off the page in 1 Chronicles 16, and they are cues we can take into our daily practice of worship and gratitude. \n\nIt’s interesting to me in that 1 Chronicles 16, David doesn’t specifically thank God for what had just happened: the bringing of the ark of the covenant into Jerusalem. They worshipped at the ark, where God dwelled, but their gratitude was cosmic in scale. It was not, “Thank You for what You did today, for this one specific thing we have to celebrate.” It was, and perhaps should usually be, “Thank You for who You have always been, for how You have loved Your people since the beginning of time.”\n\nIn corporate worship, in private prayer, in the smallest moments, and the most earth-shattering ones, we always have reason to thank God for what He has done and what we know He will do. Whether or not we feel grateful or not, whether or not we feel worshipful, there is always reason to worship in gratitude: because His faithful love endures forever. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Maria Furlough\n\nIn third grade I got called to the principal’s office for saying an inappropriate word. In my defense, someone had written it on the chair in front of me, and I was reading it aloud to my friend. As I made the trek from my classroom to the office, I remember my heart beating through my chest and tears running down my face. “Failure!” That’s what I heard over and over again in my mind, and I hated it. I never wanted to experience that feeling again—and a perfectionist started growing in me.\n\nWhen I met Jesus, my tendency toward perfectionism collided with my sinfulness, which then re-collided with the call on my life to be “holy” with my thoughts and actions. I don’t think I am alone in this struggle, and my prayer today is to break this whole “holiness” thing down and learn together how to worship God through it.\n\nLeviticus chapter 20 speaks to this call to holiness: “Consecrate yourselves and be holy, for I am the LORD your God” (v.7). In this passage, God warns His people to stay far away from cultural practices that are not of Him. God lays it out very simply: If what is going on around us is not of Him, then we need to stay away from it, to stand apart from what the world is doing—not simply because we have to, but because we want to, as an act of worship. We are called to live holy lives because we love God enough to trust that what He asks of us is for our good and His glory. \n\nIt seems simple, right? We worship God by standing apart. But how do we stand apart?\n\nWe find the answer in the next verse, which says, “Keep my statutes and do them” (Leviticus 20:8a). At the onset, we might get stuck on that fact that we can’t possibly keep all of His statutes on our own; we will always fall short and fail. Instead, we need to step into God’s infinite grace and mercy to see how He finishes the verse for us: “I am the LORD who sets you apart” (Leviticus 20:8b).\n\nIn these places of perfectionism and failure, I sense God whispering to me, “Sweet child, you worship me through holiness by coming to me over and over again and allowing Me to make you clean.” This is why Jesus came: to make us holy and bring us back into right relationship with God. He has chosen us to be His own and calls us holy now, today. Out of His great mercy, He called us out of the darkness of sin and into freedom in Him (1 Peter 2:9–10).\n\nWhat God asks of us is to do more than just hear and receive His word; we are to put our faith into action (James 1:22). He asks that we also pursue holiness and “rid [ourselves] of all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all slander” (1 Peter 2:1). In doing so, we “present [our] bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is [our] true act of worship” (Romans 12:1, emphasis mine).\n\nThis is our true act of worship: to submit ourselves daily to our loving God, and to consecrate every part of our lives to Him and His ways. We are to set our actions apart from the ways of this world, because He has chosen us and has already set us apart for Himself.\n\nEven this we cannot do this apart from the Holy Spirit in us. Let us then worship God freely, hands raised high and hearts wide open, knowing that both the holiness we possess and the holiness we pursue, He has made possible in us. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kimberly Girard\n\nLast night when I got into bed, I was completely wrecked by my sin—my selfishness in not loving my husband and children well, my discontentment, my quickness to anger, my quickness to speak out of anger… I could go on. And as I cried, I finally cried out to the Lord. I had been in the middle of writing this devotion on prayer, and yet turning to Him was not my first reaction. But the Lord, who sees and knows the depth of my sin much better than I do, met me and reminded me that He sees me in all my mess and loves me still. Indeed, there is great reward in prayer (Matthew 6:6).\n\nPrayer is coming to my Father as a needy child, acknowledging my inability to change situations or people or my own heart, and then acknowledging that God is mighty and that He reigns, ascribing worth to the Lord for who He is. \n\nIn Psalm 44, this kind of worship is modeled for us. Here, the psalmist is very real with his emotions. His plea is raw with vulnerability. He feels abandoned, yet he begins and ends the psalm in recognition of God’s faithful love for His people. Despite feeling rejected and forgotten, he comes back to what he knows to be true: God is faithful. \n\nThis is just one way prayer blesses, or “rewards,” us. When we turn to God in prayer, we are reminded of who He is and who we are not. There is relief in remembering that we are not the center of all things—not even our own lives. He is. And as He recenters us, He is able to do serious work in our hardened hearts as only He can, bringing peace when we feel fraught with anxiety.\n\nOf course, the ultimate reward of prayer is being in relationship with the Lord Himself. Prayer can be a form of worship because engaging in prayer reminds us that He is in our midst, in the details of our lives. “God is our refuge and strength, a helper who is always found in times of trouble” (Psalm 46:1). Regardless of our circumstances, He is sovereign. \n\n“The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love” (Psalm 103:8). God knows our desperate need of Him, even when we don’t acknowledge it ourselves. He says, “Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). His presence alone is the perfect balm to our weary souls.\n\nPrayer is an open invitation to relationship with God. It’s not always going to look pretty because we’re sinful, a broken and messy people. But Jesus’s blood covers all our sin—past, present, and future. He sees us in secret, knows the depths of our hearts, and loves us still.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nWhen I was seven or eight, I went to a Vacation Bible School with one of my friends. Her church was huge, much bigger than the one I attended every Sunday with my parents, and VBS was the biggest event of the summer. I remember being in awe throughout the morning session, which was complete with flashing lights, teenagers-turned-VBS-couselors performing skits on stage, and a David Crowder song based on part of the NIV translation of 2 Samuel 6:22: “I will become even more undignified than this.” The first few lyrics of the song are forever etched in my memory. I can still picture hundreds of kids jumping around the room singing: “I will dance, I will sing, to be mad for my King. / Nothing, Lord, is hindering this passion in my soul…” That’s the first time that I remember feeling like worship was a celebration. \n\nCelebration occurs all throughout Scripture—beautiful examples of people being reminded, and in turn, reminding one another, of who God is and what He has done. In Exodus 23, the Israelites are given specific instructions to celebrate throughout the year as a reminder of what God had done for them. And in Acts 2, we get a glimpse into how the early Church celebrated when they met together to praise God.\n\nIn 2 Samuel 6, we read about the all-out worship of King David before his God. He was “leaping and dancing before the LORD” (v.16), celebrating the arrival of the ark of the covenant in Jerusalem. However, his wife, Michal, thought his celebration was undignified and dishonoring. But David kept on celebrating, telling her, “I will dance before the LORD, and I will dishonor myself and humble myself even more” (vv.21–22). \n\nSince that morning at VBS, I’ve worshiped through celebration countless times. Any time we are gathered with other people to rejoice in what God has done or is doing in our lives, we worship and honor our God. Sometimes that takes the form of worship as we normally think of it, as singing, praying, and rejoicing, And sometimes, it can look a little different, like an outright, good ole celebration—birthday dinners and wedding receptions, baptisms and showers.\n\nIt’s important to remember that celebration can be a form of worship—a response to who God is and what He has done. And when we remember all that He has done for us, of course our response should be celebration! We have received grace upon grace in Christ, and that is worth celebrating.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Worship Through Sacrifice",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nMy toes tend to curl when I hear the word “sacrifice.” My toes curl when I’m uncomfortable, when my anxiety spikes, or when I see something gross or gory flash across the television screen. It’s involuntary, like the knee-jerk reflex test at my annual physical. There’s some sort of connection in my brain between the word “sacrifice” and the feeling of danger and discomfort. \n\nI don’t think that’s necessarily a bad reaction, but one that gives me pause when I think about today’s readings. Even the notion of “worship as sacrifice” feels a little primitive, conjuring up images of priestly rites and clean animals and fires and blood. \n\nThe Old Testament sacrificial system depended on an exchange: the clean blood of an animal exchanged for a person’s uncleanness. Psalm 51 shows David’s prayer of repentance after his sin with Bathsheba. It is full of references to the sacrificial system but hints at the salvation to come: “You do not want a sacrifice, or I would give it; you are not pleased with a burnt offering” (v.16).\n\nWe no longer have to offer blood sacrifices to draw near to God; rather, Jesus has served as the sacrifice. Hebrews 10 gives us all the assurance of this blessed truth: “By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time” (v.10). \n\nRitual sacrifice is no longer required from us, but as we read today, sacrifice is presented as a form of worship. Throughout the New Testament, we see sacrifice exhorted and explained. It is part of our life of worship, our response to who God is and what He has done for us. \n\nThe beautiful story in Luke 7 shows a sinful woman offering her finest perfume to wash the feet of Jesus. Her sacrifice is monetary, but she also lays down whatever pride and fear she must have had. Given the scornful cynicism of the Pharisees who watched her, her actions must have cost her substantially more than an alabaster jar of fine perfume. \n\nIn Romans 12, Paul calls believers to sacrifice by living differently than the present age. “Do not be conformed to this age,” he writes (v.2). Reflecting on what it would truly mean for me to live differently than the world also makes my toes curl. \n\nHebrews 13 gives us two more examples of sacrifice: praise and good works. Philippians 4 commends financial offerings as sacrifice (v.18). And Mark 12 tells us that loving God and loving our neighbor are more valuable than burnt offerings (v.33).\n\nSacrifice looks like submission to God as He renews my heart, mind, words, service—my whole life—to better reflect His perfect character and boundless mercy. I am called to sacrifice my sinful nature, my active temptations, and my selfishness in an ongoing act of worship and praise to God, whose sacrifice alone makes me worthy to stand before Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nFor the record, I’m a pretty good driver. But give me an open stretch of highway heading west into a golden sunset or a dark country road lit by only a glowing harvest moon, and you’ll have reason to worry if you’re in my passenger seat. My focus shifts to the sky. Not only do I linger on the beauty, but I want whoever is riding with me to be deeply moved by it too. “Look at that sky!” I repeat, pointing and craning my neck to see more. “Do you see it?” I ask again, wanting to be sure that my passenger isn’t missing any of the glory. \n\nIn Reflections on the Psalms, C.S. Lewis said, “I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation.” Expressing awe and wonder deepens our appreciation, and we are better for it. As Lewis also said, praise is inner-health made audible.\n\nWe see this life-giving, out-loud pattern of worship throughout Scripture. It starts by recognizing the power and presence of God. Then, we proclaim His goodness to others. In turn, we experience deeper meaning and joy ourselves. \n\nWe see this in Deuteronomy when we read of Moses, ancient Israel’s prophet and deliverer, proclaiming the greatness of God to all the people. He says, “I will proclaim the LORD’s name. Declare the greatness of our God!” (Deuteronomy 32:3).\n\nWe hear it in the psalmist’s song of praise in times of both celebration and suffering. He proclaims, “I will bless the LORD at all times; his praise will always be on my lips” (Psalm 34:1).\n\nIt is good for praise to bubble up from our hearts and for celebration to spill out of our mouths as we proclaim God and His creative work all around us. But, there’s more. This pattern of proclamation deepens as we also give voice to how God has touched us personally. \n\nIn John 9, Jesus illustrates how God reveals Himself to the world through His personal touch by restoring sight to a man born blind. Neighbors wondered if the one with fresh eyes could really be the blind beggar they had passed on the street year after year. The Jewish leaders, fearing that Jesus was gaining reputation and power among the people, also cast suspicion on the miracle. They interrogated, insulted, and expelled the man from their community. But neither his neighbors’ skepticism nor the Jewish leaders’ intimidation would prevent the healed man from publicly declaring the works and ways of Jesus. He says, “One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I can see!” (v.25). This man had been given new vision and a new story. \n\nThis is the pattern of proclamation: I recognize that I was once blind, but now I have seen and experienced God’s personal touch and restoration in my life. This causes me to humbly and boldly proclaim His goodness to others, and my joy and wonder deepen as I share my story. \n\nSo, lean out the window and look again. God is at work all around us and even inside our own lives. Nudge the person next to you and crane your neck to see more. Look at what God is doing! Do you see it? Share the vision, and proclaim the story. We don’t want anyone to miss His glory! \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nOne evening I was invited to a friend’s house to pray. The agenda was simple enough: eat snacks and mingle, settle in to spend time alone in prayer, then encourage each other. \n\nI’m not always comfortable with group events, and nine times out of ten I’ll choose a quiet evening at home over a social gathering, especially on a weeknight. But this time I went. Mostly compelled by an opportunity to catch up with some friends and the possibility of a slice of cheesecake, I reassured myself that the tender-heart time wouldn’t last too long. \n\nSeveral months later, I cannot recall how the food tasted, or what shoes I wore, or how awkward I felt. But I clearly remember how the Lord used that gathering to soften my heart in a very specific way. That night, in the quiet of the solo prayer time, the Holy Spirit impressed upon my heart just two words: make room.\n\nIn the days that followed, I considered the different ways I could make room: in my heart, on my calendar, in my home. I thought about who I could make room for: the new women moving to our burgeoning city, the people I know who need more than they have to offer, and the guy who definitely eased his way in front of me in line at the concession stand last weekend. But even before any of that, I can make room for my Lord, who promises me His presence whether I take time to be present with Him or not (John 14:16–17). \n\nAs I penciled down a list, I realized all the ways people had already made room for me: \n\nHere is my time; it’s yours now. Here is this meal; I want you to be nourished. Here is my forgiveness; I know what a gift it is to be forgiven. Here is this space to sit; I’d rather you have rest than me. Here I am entering into your sorrow, I was comfortable, but you need comfort more than me.\n\nEven more extravagant than the hospitality offered to me by others is that offered by the Father Himself:\n\nI was an orphan; He calls me His daughter (John 1:12). I was a foreigner; He made me a citizen (Ephesians 2:19). My sin made me unclean like a leper; He did not cast me out (Ephesians 2:13).\n\nHospitality, I am learning, is often untidy and almost always inconvenient. But making room is not about my own comfort. It’s about taking something I presume is mine and offering it to someone else. \n\nJesus made room for everyone, for all types of people—neighbors, the poor, His betrayers, strangers, children, and so many more. It was a mark of His ministry: giving Himself and offering Himself to others and to the Father. Jesus made room because His is a gospel for all people. The apostle Paul writes, “ For those of you who were baptized into Christ have been clothed with Christ. There is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male and female; since you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:27–28). In the gospel, there is no “other”—there is only “us.”\n\nBy His grace, God makes us living testimonies of Christ’s life by this truth: “We love because He first loved us” (1 John 4:19). In being inconvenienced and uncomfortable and messy, we find a nearness with God, because Jesus was these things and more on our behalf. We are learning to make room for others, because while we were still sinners, room was made for us.\n\nThanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nI’m embarrassed to admit how often I don’t love my neighbor. \n\nOne of my neighbors is a man who regularly stands on a corner near my house. Pangs of guilt shoot through my heart every time I shift my eyes away from him as I pass by. I have a long list of excuses for my inaction, of course—mind tricks and rationalizations to push away the guilt. It might not be safe to interact… I might enable an addiction… I can’t make a difference anyway. But is ignoring his very existence the way of the gospel? \n\nWhen asked point-blank to identify the most important commandment, Jesus responded:\n\n“Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind,  and with all your strength. The second is, Love your neighbor as yourself.  There is no other command greater than these” (Mark 12:30–31).\n\nNotice how Jesus snuck two commandments into His answer? With this twofold response, Jesus showed just how interrelated and inseparable these two commandments really are. To truly love God, we must also love people.\n\nOn our best days, we want to obey Jesus’s command. But if we’re honest, some people are easier to love than others. Maybe they require less sacrifice, they love us back, or they just caught us in a good mood. Whatever our reasons, Jesus challenged this preference and inconsistency: “For if you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same?” (Matthew 5:46). In other words, don’t expect a gold star for only loving when it’s easy.\n\nWhen we feel guilty, we often want to justify our actions. When the Holy Spirit whispers to our conscience, we might argue away that sense of conviction by asking, Who really is my neighbor? In the book of Luke, we see a lawyer asking Jesus for clarification on the very same question (Luke 10:29). Jesus responded with the parable of the good Samaritan, a story that still offends our sensibilities, no matter how many times we hear it. Jesus told this parable to show His followers both who they should love and how they should love. The Good Samaritan and the man in the ditch had nothing in common, except for this one important detail: they were both journeying on the same road. For Jesus, that was enough of a reason to stop, to care, to be a neighbor. Anyone in our path—or on our path—is our neighbor, and we are called to love them. \n\nHow can we possibly love every person we meet? The truth is, in our own strength, we can’t—not perfectly. But the command remains. Scripture tells us that those who are in Christ are able to love because He first loved us (1 John 4:19–20). The life we live and the love we give are by His power and for His glory (Galatians 2:19–20). \n\nThe Son of God is the ultimate embodiment of the good Samaritan. Jesus left heaven to become one of us (Philippians 2:6–8), to seek us out and meet us in our deepest need, when we were still lying dead in the ditch of our sin (Ephesians 2:1). He left His throne room to rescue us, even to the point of death on a cross. Let us love our neighbors with this same otherworldly love, the love of Christ. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nWe dragged a queen-sized mattress from the guest room, which could only mean one thing: showtime. Growing up, my brother and I crafted our best gymnastics routines under the forest green glow of our bonus room. Standing in line, we’d take turns tumbling and toppling to the latest Backstreet Boys hits, the mattress catching our falls. We would practice for hours, gaining confidence with our bounding and landing. Then we’d make a phone call to the neighbor kids, inviting them to our pre-dinnertime performance.\n\nI should be the first to admit that the show was never great. These were not Olympic backflips and handsprings; we were the somersault-and-YMCA kind of kids. We’d run and flip and run and flip until the audience got bored and decided to show us they could actually do better—and they could do headstands. The thing is, I’ve never been able to do a headstand. My legs are too long and my patience too thin. “Just try it!” the neighborhood kids would say. “You can do it!” they insisted. \n\nWhen it comes to most things in life—and when we’re talking about how to serve those who are poor—Jesus asks us to do the same: Take the world’s promises and turn them upside down. That’s how you’ll see My promises. In Scripture, we look upside down to see right-side up. Let’s attempt a headstand together: \n\nThe LORD brings poverty and gives wealth; he humbles and He exalts. He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the trash heap. He seats them with noblemen and gives them a throne of honor” (1 Samuel 2:7–8).\n\nMaybe it’s the blood rushing to my head, but I’m seeing in a fresh light all the ways the Lord cares for the poor. He lifts them “from the dust” and gives them “a throne of honor” with noblemen. Do you see what I’m seeing? Not once do these verses mention money. True wealth has nothing to do with our bank accounts; it has to do with the riches of the kingdom that are ours in Christ.\n\nDoes God use money to help the poor get on their feet or provide them with a warm meal? Yes. Should we serve the poor among us by meeting their physical needs? Absolutely! Scripture tells us this is a non-negotiable (1 John 3:17). The gospel calls for us to make room for the poor in our budgets and in our homes, and to welcome them into the family of God, just as God welcomes us. Regardless of our material wealth or lack, we are all spiritually bankrupt without the lavish love and grace of God given to us in Jesus Christ. \n\nWhen we think loving the poor is too complicated—if we get bogged down in the logistics, wondering who and how and what, when it comes to our time and resources—we can go to God’s Word for clarity. In his first letter to Timothy, Paul gives us a reminder on how to see things gospel-side up:\n\nInstruct them to do what is good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and willing to share,  storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the coming age,  so that they may take hold of what is truly life (1 Timothy 6:18–19).\n\nGenerosity is more than a kind gesture; it is a lifeline that keeps us tethered to what is real, to what is eternal. When we joyfully give our resources to those in need, it reminds us that everything we have is a gift from the God who lifts us from our desperate need by His grace. May we be generous with our time, our homes, our money, as an outpouring of the room that has already been made for us in Christ. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nAs a teenager I was a pretty lousy prodigal. The youngest of three daughters, I had the benefit of watching my sisters’ rebellious moments backfire, and so I learned quickly that the best way to stay in my parents’ good graces was to toe the line. Add to that the fact that we lived at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, surrounded by structure, discipline, and people who knew how to do things right. Early on, I decided I wanted to be like them. While good leaders might make honest mistakes, they usually don’t blow a bunch of cash partying. They go to college, get good grades, and become generals and senators. \n\nI applied that same logic to my young Christian faith. I thought if I lived “rightly,” all my dreams would go just as I’d planned. I even claimed Scripture to back me up! (See Proverbs 16:3.) Instead, my self-righteousness grew like a cancer, slow and undetected, hidden by a life focused on pleasing others. \n\nThere is so much irony in self-righteousness because it is exactly the self-righteous who don’t think they have a problem. That’s why it can be a toxic sin, one that creeps into our lives without our awareness. Today, I find it most apparent in my marriage. When I’m having a bad day, God forbid my husband sneeze too loudly, miss a button on his shirt, or accidentally leave the stove on. I’m quick to point out or dwell on his minor flaws while ignoring the far bigger issue: my critical spirit.\n\nIn the parable of the prodigal son, the older brother starts a long argument with his father. He was angry and, legally speaking, he probably had a case against his younger brother. But followed to the root, his anger was really a deep-seated resentment. He tells his father, “I have been slaving many years for you” (Luke 15:29). His angry confession reveals that all along, he’d felt bitter about the work his father had asked him to do. He mentions that he’d never had a party thrown in his honor. Deep down, he felt he deserved one, along with the accolades that would surely come with it. \n\nSelf-righteousness blocks our ability to find joy in the redemption of others. When I’m being self-righteous, I’m far better at calling other people names than I am at naming my own sin. Reading the parable of the prodigal son has never been fun for me because I know I’m the older brother—heart hardened and locked up tight—and I would much rather be the younger brother, who knows he’s in desperate need of forgiveness.\n\nIn church circles, people often talk about the father running out to meet his son. I’ve heard it told that men in that culture didn’t run; they never picked up their robes, exposing their ankles. What the father did was unabashedly and radically loving. But something I’ve never noticed before was that he didn’t stop there—he didn’t just run out to greet the son who’d been lost and gone astray. The father also sought out his self-righteous son; he looked around and noticed that his eldest was missing from the party. \n\nThere is hope in the gospel of Jesus Christ, even for self-righteous people like me. Out of His abundant love, the Father comes after us too. There is room for all of us at His table.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nThis is a true story.\n\nI invited my enemy to dinner on purpose. There was no applause or great relief or gratefulness on her part. After all, she didn’t know she was my enemy. She didn’t know the words she’d said about me had made their way back to my ears. She didn’t know how wounded I’d felt by her piercing remarks about my life, my home, my personality, and my portion. \n\nShe didn’t know God had set that table for me in the presence of my enemy. And so, she enjoyed my wine and my bread, my Brussels sprouts with bacon, my perfectly roasted pork tenderloin, and my chocolate brownies, still gooey from the oven and topped with a small dollop of ice cream. She ate it all up and still left my enemy. Months later, more of her words made their way back to me, and I planned another dinner, determined to win her affections, her heart, her repentance, or at least the absence of her criticism.\n\nThis is a true story, of sorts, but not entirely the way I’ve told it to you. The truer story is that I was the enemy and God was my ever-present and gracious host. Again and again, He laid the feast before me, knowing the wounds of words like mine. Yet He invited me back again, and again, and again. This is the God who loves us.\n\nI have often thought about the small verse that follows Peter’s first denial: “Now the servants and the officials had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold. They were standing there warming themselves, and Peter was standing with them, warming himself” (John 18:18).\n\nI think, here was Peter, denying Christ and warming himself by a fire God created. But Peter was not just denying his relationship with Christ. In a way, he was also denying Christ’s divinity. He partook of the hospitality of God in the common grace of warmth on a cold night and then left the fire as if he were God’s enemy. \n\nWe are no different. \n\nThere are books aplenty with ideas for dinner parties and table settings, inspirational images and four-course meal plans, but there is no recipe for showing hospitality to those who have cursed you, except one: the imitation of God. With unimaginable hospitality, God creates a feast, and invites all the world—His own creation—to partake of it. He does so in the face of our repeated wrongs done against Him. \n\nOur gracious God invites His enemies to warm themselves by the fire. He spreads out a table in their presence (Psalm 23:5). He rescues the oxen of those who hate Him (Exodus 23:4–5). He blesses those who curse Him (Luke 6:28)—and on and on. His hospitality knows no bounds. \n\nThe story I began with is true of me, and it’s true of you too; we were enemies of God (Romans 5:10). But the story is also true in other ways. There are those who have gossiped about me, who have slandered and cursed and wronged me. Yet God invites me to imitate Him. The world says to stop offering grace, to withhold good until it’s deserved. But the gospel saves the best wine for last, and it sets an even finer spread than each and every time before. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThe first day I met Gus, he screamed at me. I had lived a quiet life up until that point, and I had never heard screaming like this before. I myself have screamed at swim meets, at being tickled, while riding on roller coasters—but never like this. Gus’s screams terrified me. His eyes were far away and unreasoning. It was like all the unknown in him rushed out of his mouth and straight at me. I wanted to run away from him and back to my quiet life. But I couldn’t run because Gus was going to be my son, and the paperwork was already at the Embassy in Ethiopia. What was I going to do—chicken out because he’s loud?\n\nIf we were together and you cared to hear, I would tell you about our adoption of two baby boys from Africa, and how they scared the curse words out of me. (They still scare the horse apples out of me sometimes.) And I would tell you that God has been so gracious and redemptive in our lives. But that’s a long story. So let’s just talk about loving people we are afraid to love, people who maybe scare us because they come from a different place. Honestly, it scares me to love people who are not like me, but it turns out, gospel love isn’t about me anyway. It’s about Jesus and how He loves.\n\nHospitality is uncomfortable. There are people who make me want to run. To a certain degree, we all like a quiet, settled life. I mean, it’s easier to remain comfy and contented with the people we’re used to, rather than to engage with those we don’t know anything about. It can feel awkward, even risky, reaching out to people who are different, whose lives seem so dissimilar to our own. \n\nThis is the heart of hospitality: finding people on the margins and bringing them in. Remember in Psalm 68, David praises the Lord because He “provides homes for those who are deserted” (v.6). “He defends the rights of the fatherless” (Isaiah 1:17). But this hospitality extends well beyond adoption or caring for widows. God has given us so many ways to reach out to the solitary, those who’ve been deserted.\n\nThe first step to hospitality is one of obedience: we must bring people in. This obedience helps us form soup kitchens, deliver casseroles, care for widows and orphans, and welcome people into our homes. But this is only the first step. Because once we have invited people in, we are called to love them the way Christ loved us. \n\nIn the book of Zephaniah we see this exquisite mystery:\n\nThe LORD your God is among you, a warrior who saves. He will rejoice over you with gladness. He will be quiet in his love. He will delight in you with singing (Zephaniah 3:17).\n\nOur heavenly Father rejoices over us with singing! And because we are called to imitate Christ, we can’t just stop at going through the motions and serving folks soup once a year or when convenient. We are called to rejoice over others with singing; to love them. \n\nMaking this jump on our own is impossible. The only way to change our hearts is to submit them to Christ. Pray with me today that God would teach us hospitality toward widows and orphans and all those on the margins—and not only hospitality, but love.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nMy husband and I moved into a new house last summer—well, a new house to us, at least. In fact, it is a very old house, full of drafty windows and narrow stairs, but all those quirks were glossed over with stainless steel appliances, fresh paint, and marble countertops. For us, part of the appeal was extra space to share, but we had no idea how quickly the need would arise. \n\nWe hadn’t finished unpacking when we learned that a missionary family from Spain needed a place to live for a month. Not knowing who they were or how much English they spoke, we agreed, then hurried to set up a bed and buy some extra towels for the guest bathroom. \n\nThe couple arrived a few days later with their 18-month-old son, who had bright blonde hair and a gap-toothed grin. I had only a few semesters of high school Spanish under my belt, but after just a few days, through smiles and hugs and the heavy use of words like gracias, Rebecca and I had become fast friends. We communicated with a mix of Spanglish and charades, soon sharing some of our deepest heartaches and joys, even though we only had the shared vocabulary of kindergarteners. It’s amazing the connection God can forge between strangers. \n\nI love that we serve a God who shows no favoritism (Romans 2:11). In a society where women were ostracized, Jesus frequently addressed women directly, talking to them about their most intimate fears and sins. He had no concern for His own reputation. He saw no difference between rich and poor, able-bodied and lame. Jesus made room for everyone. This makes me wonder, Is it possible that there is no such thing as a stranger? Is it possible that all the boundaries we draw are invisible? Is it possible that the lines of language and skin color and difference are passing away? \n\nIt was fun and exciting to welcome a family from Spain into our home. But as I read these verses of Scripture, I’m struck by how much harder it is for me to welcome in those “close” strangers who are a regular part of my life. The sister-in-law who doesn’t quite fit in. The mother who doesn’t live up to my needs or expectations. Sometimes emotional boundary lines are harder to cross than oceans. Yet, God is with us as we welcome those strangers too. He blesses our feeble efforts. He is with us when our patience wears out. He repairs the damage of lost years, and He quiets us with His love. \n\nAs Christians, it can be easy to isolate ourselves from the world. But God has shown us that this world is not our home. We, too, are foreigners in a strange land, living here only for a short while before passing on to our permanent address with the Lord. \n\nWe, of all people, can afford to open our homes to the stranger, the ostracized, the forgotten. “For our momentary light affliction is producing for us an absolutely incomparable eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:17).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\n“Mama, I feel like I’m upside down in a cornfield!” \n\nMaybe this is something commonly heard in motherhood, but since I’ve yet to become a mother, I wouldn’t know. Hopefully, you’re just as confused as I was when I woke up to this statement in the middle of the night. I rubbed my eyes in confusion, as it took a minute to regain my bearings and remember exactly where I was—at the beach, with one of my best friends and her three children. \n\nIt was their annual beach vacation, and I’d said yes last-minute to hopping in the minivan for a few days of saltwater and sunshine before the rest of the family arrived. I didn’t have to be a mother to know that a seven-hour road trip with three kids is some kind of miracle. Ours was completed with only one short episode of crying and one small snack-spilling incident. Victorious, we’d tossed aside our sandals and rolled up our jeans at the first sight of ocean. We splashed around in the dark until we could barely keep our eyes open. \n\nOur cozy hotel room was filled with baby snuggles and loud giggles. It was a world away from my quiet apartment at home, and I loved making room for every sweet moment. I was letting the little children come to me and received cuteness and cuddles—a serious benefit—in return. But upon waking up in the middle of the night, the scene was a little different.\n\nA flipped lightswitch signaled that the “upside down in a cornfield” child was awake and not dreaming. Her tiny whimper and the worried look on her mama’s face confirmed the girl’s sudden sickness and strange hallucination. Their hurried footsteps headed for the bathroom, where baby brother’s travel crib was still blocking the toilet. That’s when I remembered that I’d been sharing a water bottle with the sweet, sickly child all day long, which meant I was probably halfway to a “cornfield” myself. \n\nSmall things sometimes turn out to be the most significant and, well, contagious—especially when they have hearts that beat like yours and mine. Making room for children is hard because we never stop being children ourselves. We never stop needing our Father. We struggle to make room even for ourselves, only to see that He already has, again and again. \n\nThis is why it’s important to make room for the children tugging on our shirts and hanging on our legs even—especially—if they aren’t living in our homes. The parent-child relationship is one of the most prevalent themes in Scripture. Shouldn’t it be one of the most prevalent themes in our lives? We should care for these little ones Jesus loves so dearly. Even when it means getting messy. Even when it means waking up in the middle of the night. Even when it means being upside down in a cornfield. \n\nIsn’t that what He does for us? God knew us when we were formless (Psalm 139:16). He prepared praise from our mouths as infants (Matthew 21:16). He asks us simply to come to Him (Matthew 19:14). May we do the same for others, especially when they are small, for they are not small to Him. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nNow the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul,  and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own,  but they had everything in common (Acts 4:32).\n\nThis verse sure feels warm and fuzzy. It’s easy to romanticize the friendships in the early church. But the reality of our own relationships surely lifts the veil. What is true for us must also have been true for them: authentic community takes work. \n\nMind if I make a confession? I spent most of my adult life trying to live without intimate Christian friendship. It was too uncomfortable for me, too messy. The investment didn’t seem to match the payout. But living life outside the circle was like being a fish in a bowl: I could survive, but I sure didn’t thrive. My patient, loving, imperfect friends have pulled me out into deeper waters again and again. \n\nI used to think this verse from Acts 4 meant the church shared all their “stuff.” Maybe they rotated the ancient equivalent of lawn mowers and weed eaters, or pooled their money to get a better rate at the fish market. There may have been an element of that, but I’m now convinced they had more than stuff in common. \n\nThey shared their gifts, recognizing that spiritual gifts are given by God “for the common good” (1 Corinthians 12:4–11). \n\nThey shared the hope of glory, recognizing that we’ve been adopted into the same family by the will of the Father (Romans 8:15–17). \n\nThey shared a calling, recognizing that we can spend our lives building little, individual kingdoms, destined to pass away, or we can join forces to join God in working on the only kingdom promised to stand forever (2 Samuel 7:16). \n\nIf the church in Acts was anything like my community of friends, the people there shared their burdens too. When the weight of hurt or disappointment or rejection becomes too heavy for one of us to carry, we lay it down, knowing someone else in the circle will pick it up. \n\nJust this week, I was hauling a load of heartache so big I worried it might bury me. My friends stepped in and said, “Let us carry this with you.” My circumstances didn’t change, my heart didn’t instantly mend, but I could stand up straight again. When life knocked me down, these friends picked me up. This, too, is a picture of hospitality. The way we in the Church respond to each other in the toughest of times shoots up a flare. It tells a watching world that we are broken and busy people, eternally bound together with the unbreakable chord of Christ’s love. “By this everyone will know that we are [His] disciples, if [we] love one another” (John 13:35).\n\nYes, hospitality is worth extending because of the benefits it affords us, but there’s a bigger story being told. Jesus knows we’re His disciples based on the evidence found in our hearts. The world knows we’re His disciples based on the evidence found in our homes. It doesn’t matter if our houses are big enough, if our floors are clean enough, if our cooking skills are accomplished enough—we should show hospitality anyway. Our hearts and lives are messy. But when we open our doors and our arms, we’re telling the story of Christ’s love.\n\nIf you’re living in a fishbowl, gulping and gasping for air, allow hospitality to pull you into deeper waters. Because it’s not just about gathering; it’s about giving. It’s not about neat and tidy; it’s about the poor and needy. It’s not about you. It’s about Christ and His Church. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Making Room for the Lost Cause",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\n“Everybody, even the worst stinker on earth, is somebody for whom Christ died.”  –Robert Farrar Capon\n\nI know so many stinkers. I bet you do too. The question of what to do about someone who seems like a lost cause is, frankly, often on my mind. I knew some real stinkers even when I was in middle school, and during those years I was very committed to reading The Lord of the Rings. All those years ago, dressed in my mithril shirt, clutching my sword of Gondor, and nibbling on lembas bread, I discovered the stinker to beat them all: Gollum. \n\nOriginally, he was just a normal hobbit, until he fell into some bad circumstances (found a dangerous object) and made some bad choices (murdered his cousin) that conspired to turn him into the wretched creature we all know as Gollum. Most of the “lost causes” I know got that way because of similar reasons: an unfortunate combination of bad choices and bad circumstances. \n\nThat instinct to be free of a “lost cause” is something many of us share, although we aren’t inclined to admit it. But, man, remember how Saul persecuted the church, and stood by, complicit, at the stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:54–66)? God picked Saul up, turned him around one hundred and eighty degrees, and sent him in the other direction with instructions to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God (Acts 9:20). God wasn’t done with Saul; He had a whole new life in store for him as Paul, follower of Jesus.\n\nThe story of Zacchaeus is similar, though instead of being a zealous Pharisee, Zacchaeus was a rich and “sinful” man (Luke 19:1–2,7). But like Paul, Zacchaeus repented when he met Christ (Luke 19:5–6). Both Paul and Zacchaeus turned from their old way of life, not because they sought Christ on their own, but because they were called to Him. The change in their lives didn’t happen because they were fed up with life and focused all their gumption toward making themselves better human beings. It was God who called them to Himself.\n\nIf you are a Christian today, it’s not because you are a better or more disciplined person than your “lost cause.” It is because of “the One who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9). He calls us. He changes us. It is He who makes the difference in the lives of the broken, the stubborn, the sneaky, the exhausting, the terrifying, and the unlovely. \n\nWhat do we do in the meantime? If it’s all up to God, does that get me off the hook? I would be so happy to go back to my second breakfast and let God deal with His own invitations to stinkers. Jonah definitely felt the same way: Good riddance, Nineveh, you bunch of eye-gougers! (Jonah 3:1–3; 4:1–3, my summation and paraphrase). Then God had to call both Jonah and Nineveh to obedience; He called Nineveh to repent and Jonah to deliver His message of repentance.\n\nAnd there it is. God does the calling. God does the changing. We are called to pray and walk in obedience, even if our steps are slow. \n\nWe don’t know the exact end of the story. In spite of how much I wanted Gollum to be shoved off a cliff and go away already, at the end of The Lord of the Rings, he was necessary to save the whole world. Even the most seemingly hopeless case may still have a part to play. The gospel urges us not to give up, but instead to hope continually in quiet obedience.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nI’ve lived in 17 different homes during my 32 years of life, counting every dorm room and short-term apartment. From a young age, I’ve attempted to nest in each one. In eighth grade, I painted my room lime green. In college, I carefully picked out every accessory for my dorm room. In my adult life I’ve nested hard, spending weeks and months picking out furniture, arranging and rearranging gallery walls until everything was just right. It’s not that I’m a brilliant interior decorator (lime green, remember?); I just want each place I live in to feel like a home.\n\nWe may express it differently, but we all long for home. We have an innate desire to be where we belong—or to belong where we are. I wonder if this longing can be traced back to Adam and Eve when they lost their home, banished from the Garden of Eden for good.\n\nFor their entire existence, Adam and Eve had operated one way within in the garden. Naked and free, they had no shame or fear. They were at one with God. Then in a moment, everything changed, and “the eyes of both of them were opened” (Genesis 3:7). Suddenly, Adam and Eve were aware of their nakedness. They were afraid of God and ashamed to be seen by Him. When they left the garden that day, they lost more than their home; they lost themselves too.\n\nI wonder if at the root of our desire to know where we belong is the desire to know who we are. Not only do we crave a return to Eden, but a return to who we were within Eden: unashamed, free, in communion with our God. Now we are as David laments, “guilty when I was born… sinful when my mother conceived me” (Psalm 51:5).\n\nWe have an opportunity during this Easter season to grieve the loss of Eden and the loss of innocence. We can sit and contemplate our desire for home and belonging, place and identity. We do so with pain and sadness, but also with expectancy and hope.\n\nIn our quests for home, we need look no further than what we celebrate during Easter—an empty tomb. That is where our identities changed from sinful to righteous, from banished to welcome. When I know who I am in Christ, I always know where I belong. I always know where home is—in Him.\n\nSo this season we grieve and we celebrate. We are banished no more, guilty no more. We are ashamed no more because of Christ, the cross, and a tomb that lay empty. Let’s rejoice in Christ, the joy of our salvation. And let us give thanks to God who has revealed “the path of life to me,” the path leading home (Psalm 16:11).\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nBack in college, I was still of the mindset that if I behaved and performed well, God would reward me accordingly. And because I did the “right” things and got good grades, I assumed my post-college life would be smooth sailing. I expected that once graduation rolled around, I’d have a big plan—a big job—something I could tell people that would make their eyebrows go up an inch, showing that they were impressed.\n\nBut by March of my senior year, with just a couple months until the end of the semester and graduation looming, I still had no plans. The country was facing a recession. I had no job. No prospects. And I was angry at God, frustrated that I had no direction for the future, and convinced He had forgotten me. Slowly, my heart began to rebel against God, growing cold and guarded. I didn’t believe He cared about me, and so I withdrew from Him. In anger, I did all the things I knew in my heart weren’t His best for me. I would call them mistakes, except my actions were entirely intentional. I ran directly toward sin, only to end up feeling burned and ashamed.\n\nThe good news of Christ is so good because the bad news is so bad. And what’s the bad news? Not much has changed since the time of Noah. In Mark 7:21, Jesus told a crowd that what defiles a person isn’t from the outside, but what comes from the heart. All you have to do is turn on the news to see that evil still reigns in this world. But the worst of us comes from within. I have extreme memories that remind me of my wayward heart. I also have daily decisions, moments when I put aside my devotion to Christ and serve my whims, appetites, and desires.\n\nMy heart is a place of longing, doubt, and restlessness. I seek out quick comfort and distraction long before I seek God’s counsel and righteousness. I need a Savior, not to save me from sin out there. I need a Savior to save me from myself. The flood isn’t the world of other people. The most dangerous flood is the faithlessness of my heart. I need an ark. A hiding place. A safe haven from the deluge of my own desire and rebellion that would take me far from God.\n\nGod has given me such a Savior.\n\nThere is nothing I can do to remove His love from me. The door to the ark is always open. The covenant will not change. The destruction I deserve is not coming for me. “Though the mountains move and the hills shake, [His] love will not be removed from [us]” (Isaiah 54:10).\n\nThe good news is so good: Jesus is far better than any wooden boat that spares my life from external destruction.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThe binding of Isaac breaks my heart every time I read it. I subconsciously swap myself for Abraham and replace Isaac with my beloved firstborn son, and suddenly the story hurts in a real and visceral way. (Did you do this when you read the passage?) Each physical hurdle becomes agonizing—the saddling of the donkey, the splitting of the wood, the long walk uphill, and finally, the binding up of a beloved boy. The whole agonizing ordeal truly begs the question: How did Abraham do it? How did he make it through all the steps up to the very point of raising a knife over his promised and beloved son?\n\nChillingly, child sacrifice has a long, established history in many cultures, including that of Mesopotamia. Abraham was from Ur (Genesis 11:31), and so he would have been familiar with the sacrifice of a child to prove devotion to a god. Similarly, the Canaanites worshipped Molech, the false god most famous for demanding child sacrifice. The idea behind the sacrifice was this: If you are willing to sacrifice the person most precious to you—and for parents, nothing could be more precious to us than our children—then you could prove your devotion to your god. Abraham had certainly encountered this kind of demand before with regard to other cultural gods.\n\nSecond, Abraham trusted God. He trusted that “I AM” was not just another Baal or Molech. Abraham believed that God was the one true God, and he cherished the profound hope that “I AM” was different. Abraham had such trust that he reasoned God would provide for a miraculous resurrection to save Isaac, if that’s what it took (Hebrews 11:19). He even told Isaac, “God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son” (Genesis 22:8).\n\nFor both these reasons, we find Abraham shuddering with a knife raised over that which is most precious to Him. And we find ourselves standing right beside him, surveying the hopelessness of our station. We are dead in our trespasses, we live under a curse, and we have no hope of satisfying the chasm of debt that we owe. Indeed, the consequence of our sin is death (Romans 6:23).\n\nWe need a God who can raise the dead (Matthew 10:8). We need a God who has the power to undo the curse (Romans 8:2). And our God has promised and proven that He can and will do both. Our God does not demand child sacrifice—He abhors it! After all, He knits together our children and treasures them because they are His very own. We don’t need a false god with a lust for flesh and a desire for pain. Rather, we worship the one true God, who preserves, protects, loves, and cherishes us and our children. Hallelujah!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nLet’s face it, when the Lord called the Israelites “stiff-necked,” He was being kind.\n\nOn their best days, they were whiney, rebellious, fearful, and contentious. And this particular day we’re reading about was definitely not one of their best. \n\nWith metal they’d pillaged from their enemies (Exodus 12:35), they fashioned a statue of a calf and convinced themselves that the idol was the Lord Himself, the one who had delivered them from slavery in Egypt. \n\nIt’s okay to shake your head. Their error was preposterous. In hindsight, I suppose it’s obvious that rebellion against a loving and sovereign God always is. No wonder God declared, “Now leave me alone, so that my anger can burn against them and I can destroy them” (32:10). \n\nThis was the nation that had seen God send plagues to torment their oppressors. These were the ones who had walked across the Red Sea on dry ground. These were God’s chosen people, those who had tasted the manna He’d rained from heaven. And still, as soon as their leader was out of earshot, they turned their adoration toward a weaker god—one who could never save them. God’s wrath was surely justified.\n\nGod is holy. His people were unholy. \nHe is generous.  They were greedy. \nHe is faithful. They were faithless.\nHe showcased His power.  They bowed before a powerless statue instead. \n\nWe’ve all bowed before the wrong altars. Who will plead our cause? We cannot shake our sin nature. Who will defend our case? We are the rebellious children of a holy, holy, holy God. Who will stay His hand?\n\nThis moment in Israel’s history allows us to peek at the glory of the gospel. In pleading with the Lord to spare the Israelites, Moses was pointing forward to Christ, who right now—right this very minute—is our advocate, standing between our sin and the punishment we rightly deserve (Romans 8:34). We remain God’s beloved, yet rebellious, children—our hearts ever turning toward all that glitters. Even so, God’s wrath is stayed because there is One who pleads for us even now. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nAs an undergrad, I studied political science and economics, and spent more hours than I can count learning, arguing, unlearning, and repositioning my political compass. But after four years of study, it was clear to me that there is no perfect form of government, no flawless ideology or leader. \n\nAnd yet, I find myself wrapped up in the political whirlwind even now. I think, But what if the promises are true? What if this person really can make a difference? What if she or he will make my life easier, my money stretch farther, my kids safer? \n\nIt is easy to fall into the same trap as the Israelites oh-so long ago. When things get tough, personally or globally, the lure of a strong leader is hard to resist. They must have thought, What if we had a king to protect us from our enemies? What if we had someone who could make us into a strong nation?\n\nGod gave Israel a king: first Saul, then the great King David, then Solomon. Saul fought for them, David led them, and Solomon dispensed wisdom from his throne. But ultimately, these men failed, as all earthly kings do. This narrative is a rather simple one to unpack: the people asked for a king, God gave them kings, those kings failed, and then God promised to send them the real King, all of which is true, of course. \n\nBut our need for a king goes back further than Solomon, David, and Saul. It goes back to the garden, when Adam and Eve walked with God and the serpent tempted them with power. Because isn’t that the root of our desire for a king? Power. Power over our enemies, our circumstances, and our future. \n\nFrom the beginning, God was wiring us for a king and setting the stage for the King of kings. He called Abraham to become the father of a nation. He called Moses and His people to a land. He gave Moses a law rooted in His character, brimming with justice and righteousness. He sent judges to call His people back to Him, to remind them of the boundaries the law provided. And then He gave them earthly kings, men whose résumés were filled with both successes and failures but who, ultimately, could never be the King the people truly needed. \n\nIn Jeremiah, during the cycle of mostly terrible kings, the prophet wrote on behalf of the Lord: “I will raise up a Righteous Branch… He will reign wisely as king and administer justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. This is the name he will be called: The LORD Is Our Righteousness” (23:5–6). \n\nThis was the promise, but also the deep desire, God had sown into the hearts of His people. The pieces were there: a people, a land, a just law. But the King was missing, and one day, the King would come. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nThis morning I drove past the lake near our house, as I always do. Today the spring sun was especially bright, causing me to squint my eyes as the light poured through my driver’s side window. A dense layer of fog covered the water as far as I could see. Gulls danced in and out of the cloud-like mist, some resting still and peaceful on the glassy surface. The sun, the fog, the gulls, the water—the combination stunned me, caught that deep sigh in my chest and held it there a minute. \n\nIt was the second day in a row the lake looked exactly like this, and both times it brought worship to my lips:\n\nI praise you, Lord, for you are the Creator God, the maker of the water and the birds, the sun and the mist, and the breath in my lungs. You are God, you are Lord, and I give you all of me today. \n\nThere was no analyzing my prayer outline or word choice, no time for false pretense or doubt. I’d seen a glimpse of the glory of the Lord, and immediate, unhindered praise felt like the only possible response.\n\nSpontaneous worship sessions are not new to our Almighty God. Since the making of mankind and the dawn of creation, people and nature have praised Him. On this day recorded in Matthew 21, Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey, and another chorus of praise erupted: \n\nHosanna to the Son of David!Blessed is he who comes in the nameof the Lord!Hosanna in the highest heaven! (v. 9). \n\nAs Luke’s Gospel tells it, “the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen” (Luke 19:37). Miracles—plural. Many of them. These people who had been following Jesus had seen evidence that this was not just a man. This man was the Son of God. They had seen glimpses of His glory, and it led them to worship.\n\nLuke also records that as Jesus rode on toward the gates of Jerusalem that day—toward the death due every single human but Him—He also wept for its brokenness. He cried for those who did not recognize the Messiah in their midst (Luke 19:44). \n\nThe Savior had come, but they did not know Him.\n\nAs we enter Holy Week on this Palm Sunday, may we see Jesus for who He is. May we read with clear eyes and open hearts the Gospel account of these days and events that are the foundation of our faith. And may we worship the One at the center of it all.\n\nBlessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is Jesus, who comes to save us.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Our Savior Is Anointed",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nIn today’s reading, Christ is anointed in both word and deed. First, we read about the children in the temple who declare, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” (Matthew 21:15). And then there is the woman in Bethany who anoints Jesus physically, breaking open a jar of perfume and pouring it out on His head (Mark 14:3). Both are beautiful examples of exulting Christ both with our words and with our actions, though not everybody in the story is happy.\n\nScripture describes the chief priests and scribes as indignant after hearing children call Jesus “Son of David,” a title reserved for the Messiah. And after the woman anoints Christ with perfume, the onlookers are described in the same way—indignant—asking, “Why has this perfume been wasted?” (v.4).\n\nThe anointing of Christ was an offense and a disruption. For the chief priests and scribes, it represented a disruption to their hierarchy, placing this man Jesus at the top. For those watching the woman spend her most expensive perfume, the anointing seemed irresponsible: Why waste such a precious possession? Additionally, as members of two marginalized and powerless demographics in first-century Judea, a woman and a group of children would not have had the authority to make such claims about a man. The anointing of Christ grated against an otherwise ordered and reasonable existence.\n\nBut did Jesus come to ensure a reasonable and ordered existence for us all?\n\nWhen the woman anoints Jesus, He says she is foreshadowing an even greater disruption to society as they knew it. Jesus’s death, burial, and resurrection were about to turn humanity upside-down. The greatest societal disruption of all was still to come, one in which the unclean would be clean and the unrighteous made righteous. \n\nIf I’m honest, I can be resistant to the Jesus who disrupts my order in the same way He disrupted the temple and the town of Bethany. I can grow very comfortable in the world I’ve created for myself and my place in it. The anointing of Christ, as well as the way He was anointed, tell me my purpose is not to be complacent with the way things are. I am to anoint Christ in word and in deed, following my King and doing His work, even if it pushes social boundaries, even if it prioritizes the wellbeing of the marginalized over my own comfort. This is the work that acts out real love toward one another, not because we are so good at loving, but because we have been so loved.\n\nThis is my prayer for us today, that our hearts would be set on the anointed Christ. I pray that the sacrificial love we have been shown and given would propel us to love others, so that one day Jesus will look at us and say, “She has done a noble thing for me” (v.6).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nMy mother sat in the passenger seat, and I was behind the wheel. My eyes glanced at the clock on the dash. Up ahead, a train inched along the track, cutting us off from the road we needed to take. People made reservations a month in advance to get a seat at this restaurant. I knew if we were too late, we’d lose our seats. I couldn’t wait any longer.\n\nWhipping the car around, I turned onto a side road and tried to find my way to the restaurant by an alternate route. But as I veered to the left, I forgot to check my blind spot. A truck barreled into the back of my car with a loud crunch. We weren’t going fast. No one was hurt. But it was most definitely my fault. I was in such a rush to get to dinner that I put our lives in danger. Thirty minutes later, we made it to the restaurant, and the hostess didn’t even mention the fact that we were late.\n\nWhen I feel the pinch of time, I rush. Jesus doesn’t. \n\nWhile reading today’s passages, I was struck by how slow and purposeful Jesus is with His disciples in their final hours together before His arrest. From the beginning of John 13, we’re told Jesus knew it was the end. He knew exactly what was coming. He even knew that Judas would be the one to deliver the deadly kiss. And yet, He doesn’t get up and start rushing around. He doesn’t point fingers or hatch an escape plan. He doesn’t open the Scriptures and start teaching frantically. He doesn’t even complete a few extra miracles, just for good measure. \n\nIn less than twenty-four hours, Jesus would be hanging on a tree, yet He stops to fill a basin with water. \n\nIn this moment, Jesus had no agenda to complete before He died, other than to show His disciples love. Putting His own fear aside, He focused solely on the words, actions, and encouragement His brothers needed to hear before He departed. Jesus knelt, took foul-smelling feet in His hands, and wiped them completely clean. (We live in a culture that is dying of thirst for this kind of selfless, slow, real love.) \n\nIn His last meal on earth, Jesus is my example. He shows me that I do not need to rush. I do not need to check items off my bucket list. I don’t even have to leave the room to do His work. All I have to do is love the people at my particular table. He teaches me that loving well doesn’t always mean teaching—it also means doing. Love means washing feet. It means embracing the foul parts of life. It means listening attentively to my friends and breaking bread, being still, even when every instinct of my heart tells me to run because we’re running out of time. \n\nThere is no need to rush when God is in control. If my Lord and Savior rested in this truth and served in this way, then He will surely help me do the same (John 13:14–15). Regardless of what appears to be blocking my path or barreling toward me in this life, I can be still and rest in Him. I can speak kindly to those around me. I can serve right now, right where I am. \n\nDear Lord, give me the strength to fill basins.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThe summer I was seventeen, I spent a few weeks house sitting for family friends. The house was beautiful, the owners had cable, and I got to have full independence so, let’s be honest, they were doing me the favor. I was working down the road at a country club in the esteemed dual position of waitress and lifeguard, and after work, sometimes the cool kids wanted to come hang at my house. I definitely did not have permission to bring lifeguards and bartenders back to the house, but I was intoxicated with the independence that only real estate can bring. When the homeowners returned, they found a picture frame upstairs that someone had accidentally broken, and every once in a while, I still feel a little prick of embarrassment due to my betrayal.\n\nI had one job. But instead of doing it perfectly and responsibly, I did an okay job with a little betrayal along the way. I had watered the plants but failed to protect the house. We like to think that we are so close to getting it just right every time, but then some external factor seems to hold us back from pitching that perfect game. (If only I hadn’t been so young and naive! If only I’d had more time. If only I weren’t so tired.)\n\nWhat if Judas felt the same way? He was so close to being a great disciple, but he missed the mark because the lure of silver proved too strong. When Judas joined the inner circle, he didn’t do it just so he could betray their leader. \n\nCertainly the rest of the disciples intended to do a great job of following Jesus. Peter, James, and John wanted to stay awake and wait with Christ while He prayed in the garden. But then they grew tired, their eyes heavy, and every single one of them gave in to sleep.\n\nIf anyone could come close to showing us an example of perfect righteousness and devotion, surely it would have been Peter; he’s “the rock,” after all (Matthew 16:18). Peter strenuously insisted that he would never make the mistake of betraying Christ, but even his very best intentions were garbage by the time the rooster crowed. If even Peter betrayed Christ in His hour of need, where does that leave us?\n\nIs it really just external hindrances holding us back, or is it possible that we don’t even understand how desperately we need the gospel? None of our righteousness—even our shiniest stuff—is sufficient. We all have Judas hearts, and even our best intentions are filthy rags. Our betrayals show us that, in big and small ways, our selfish interests are so strong we can’t resist those silver coins or those teenage lifeguards. We are all capable of deep betrayal.\n\nWhen Judas arrives in the garden to betray Him, Jesus asks, “Friend,… why have you come?” (Matthew 26:50). And He asks us the same question: Why have we come? We come out of our desperate need for a Redeemer. We come with ash smeared on our faces. \n\nWhether we feel like Judas or like Peter, we need Christ’s grace exactly the same. Even in our betrayals, Christ reaches out to His people with mercy. We are to come for this alone: Christ. We are to come for His perfect righteousness, leaning wholly upon Him, for He is the Messiah, the Son of God, and is now seated at the right hand of Power, and will come again in glory.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nI know the events of Holy Week unfolded more than two thousand years ago. I wasn’t there, and yet, as I prepare my heart for Easter morning, I keep bumping into reflections of myself in the text. \n\nHere I am in John 18: \n\nI am the Jews who escorted Jesus to Pilate. They thought they were righteous because they stayed in the front yard, yet convinced themselves their hands weren’t dirty as they handed over an innocent man for the slaughter. How often do I rely on all manner of rules to make me “clean” while willfully rebelling against a holy God? How often is my heart soiled by sin that I ignore because I’ve stuck to some arbitrary list of dos and don’ts?\n\nI am Pilate. I want to wash my hands of the matter of sin and suffering. Don’t you? Don’t we all? How often do I utter, “What is truth?” when the truth is inconvenient to me? The answer, I’m afraid, is all too often.\n\nLook, there I am in Luke 23: \n\nI am the crowds, offended by the ways Jesus interrupts the status quo and upends my paradigms. As He strips me of my comfort and convicts me of my obsession with self, my heart becomes indignant. I want to yell, scream, and stomp my feet.\n\nI am Herod. I am willing to use Jesus to suit my purposes, to elevate my own power. \n\nI see myself most clearly in Matthew 27:\n\nI am Barabbas. There’s no use in trying to deny it. I am a sinner, guilty of violating the holy law of God. Barabbas was a “notorious prisoner” of the Roman government. Without Christ, I am a prisoner to my sin. I deserve whatever punishment God could hurl at me, but He takes my place instead. Because of Him, I walk in undeserved freedom. \n\nFriend, I know you are these things too. We all are. \n\nWe are prone to value rules over righteousness. We are capable of distancing ourselves from inconvenient truth. We are irritated by the ways that following Christ can stir up trouble for us in this world, yet more than okay with using Him to elevate ourselves in the eyes of other believers. We are guilty of sin—undeniably so—and are so often imprisoned because of it. And we are as responsible for sending Jesus to the cross as the crowds who yelled, “Crucify him!”\n\nBut there is none like Him. Amen? His grace and mercy transcend time and geography. His actions on Holy Week have the power to save us just as much as they have the power to save the ones who lined the streets to see Him punished. Go on, see yourself in the story. Feel the sting of your sin. But let your eyes move quickly to Jesus, who willingly took our place so that we might be a people who walk in undeserved freedom. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nThis is it. \n\nThis is the question and answer, the moment, the hinge upon which all of history sits. \n\nDid Jesus, fully man and fully God, die on the cross, not just as a Jewish rebel and teacher in ancient Rome, but as the promised Messiah and Savior of all humanity? \n\nDid He?\n\nDo you believe it? \n\nDo I?\n\nI have a very vivid memory of standing in the emerald-green-tiled shower of our charmingly dilapidated St. Louis apartment, a year and a half into seminary, water washing over me and tears rushing down my face. I asked myself, “Do you really believe this is true? Do you?” The questions, the concepts, and the reordering of my heart and mind were almost too much. \n\nI have an equally vivid memory of driving to Target the afternoon our little friend-family experienced unspeakable tragedy, and of whisper-screaming with every breath I took, saying, “Jesus, be real. Jesus, BE REAL. Jesus, please be real.”  \n\nI have just as many if not more moments of deep assurance, of knowing Christ to be true. I resonate with John Wesley’s words describing his own faith: “I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.”\n\nAll this makes me wonder, reflecting on today’s Scripture, how many people who were there at Christ’s crucifixion found themselves feeling the terror of unbelief? And who felt the sweet, blessed assurance of faith? What would it have been like to be a witness to this moment, to believe that all the promises of the ages were coming true? Or to be a blind witness, without faith, and to feel nothing more for Jesus than for the criminals who hung next to Him? \n\nThe terror of unbelief settled on Peter, who denied Jesus three times. Disbelief motivated the scoffing Jewish leaders, and the insulting criminal on the cross. It led Pilate to apathy.\n\nBut the repentant thief on the cross next to Jesus believed. The centurion gasped at the sudden darkness and knew this was not just another prisoner hanging nearby. \n\nJoseph and Nicodemus believed, and acted in faith to care for the broken body of the Son of God. Chapters earlier we read that Nicodemus, a pharisee, wasn’t sure if he believed in Jesus; but in today’s reading, we suddenly find him doing the humiliating work of preparing the Lord’s dead body for burial—work typically reserved for women and slaves. Nicodemus knew it was all true.\n\nThis is it. And it is all true. \n\nIt is true on the days I am blindsided by the terror of unbelief. And it is true on the days I feel it doubtlessly in every bone and blood cell in my body. \n\nMy Good Friday prayer, in this between-Friday-and-Sunday life that we live, is that I will always remember and proclaim, “Truly, this man is the Son of God” (Matthew 27:54). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nAs a serial doubter, I have always loved the resurrection story and its honest portrayal of who was quick to believe Jesus was the risen Christ and who was more skeptical. Historically, I have been more like Thomas, wanting proof and evidence: “If I don’t see the mark of the nails in his hands, put my finger into the mark, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe” (John 20:25).\n\nMary Magdalene’s reaction to the risen Christ differed from that of Thomas. She believed as soon as Jesus spoke her name. “Rabboni!” she cried in recognition (v.16). And later when she saw the disciples, she said with confidence, “I have seen the Lord!” (v.18).\n\nThomas trusted Jesus’s scars. Mary trusted Jesus’s voice.\n\nIn my early twenties, I went through a dark season of doubt. Out in the real world for the first time, surrounded by people who did not believe in Christianity, much less God, I was suddenly very unsure of my own beliefs. I desperately wanted to prove God’s existence to my unbelieving friends—and to myself. So I searched for answers in apologetics, academics, and science, confident that if I could pull enough evidence together, I could believe again, and my friends would too.\n\nDuring that youthful season, it was not the hard evidence of academics and apologetics that I grew to trust and understand. Ultimately, what pulled me back to faith was this: At some point in my life I had known the risen Christ. I had felt the love of God through Him. I had experienced grace and forgiveness. I was not sure how to prove the existence of God through science, but I could not deny that I had experienced the risen Christ. I had heard Him say my name.\n\nThis is not to say investigating our faith is fruitless. After all, Jesus did not chastise Thomas for asking for proof. He gave it to him, saying, “Put your finger here and look at my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Don’t be faithless, but believe” (John 20:27). But even today, when I find myself wrestling with questions about God, the Bible, Jesus, or religion, what I return to is not the evidence I’ve gathered, proving His existence. What I remember is the fact that Jesus has touched my life, and I have seen the marks on it as a result. \n\nWhen the doubt is crippling, when the road before us is unclear, may we remember this day near the tomb. Mary Magdalene thought she had lost her friend, her teacher, her Rabbi. All was sorrow before and around her—and then, she heard Him speak her name. Have you heard Him speak yours?\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nWhat would you do if you wanted to start a revolution? If you wanted to prove that you were the most powerful person to ever walk the earth? If you wanted to prove that you had in fact just been raised from the dead? What would you do first?\n\nI think I would shoot fireworks from my fingertips. Or maybe go to the people who had tried to kill me, and show them I was alive once again. I think I’d go flying around in the sky shouting from the rooftops. \n\nThese final few verses were Luke’s last chance to convince readers that Jesus really did rise from the dead. That He really is the Son of God. As a writer, I cannot fathom a more challenging task. But Luke made a decision. He decided to stick to the facts, and the facts are mind-bogglingly simple. \n\nFirst, the women. A group of women find the empty tomb and return to their friends babbling in an excited confusion. This in itself should convince us of the veracity of this story. After all, in the first century, women were considered unreliable witnesses; their testimony wasn’t even permitted in a court of law. Tim Keller writes: “If the Christians were making up these stories to get their movement off the ground, they never would have written women into the story as the first eyewitnesses to Jesus’s empty tomb. The only possible reason for the presence of women in these accounts is that they really were present and reported what they saw.”\n\nSecond, the walk. While Peter runs to the tomb to determine if what the women said is true, Jesus goes on a walk. Oh, how I love this story! Two disciples I’ve never heard of—Cleopas and a disciple who goes unnamed—are walking and talking, processing recent events, when this stranger sidles up next to them. They recount all the events of the week: “How have you not heard about this?!” And then, still under the guise of a stranger, Jesus begins to teach from the Scriptures, starting from Genesis 1:1. Jesus loves Scripture. He knows it—He is the Word made flesh, after all (John 1:14)—and His teaching sets their hearts aflame. They have a simple meal together, and then just as quickly as He appeared to them, Jesus was gone. \n\nThen, His words. Jesus’s first resurrected words to His gathered disciples were, “Peace be with you” (John 20:21). He knows they are terrified, full of doubt. And again, His first action in their presence is not to perform a miracle, but to perform the mundane. He invites them to touch Him, to see His hands and feet. He takes a bite of fish—at face value, an act not of divine power as much as simple human digestion. He then goes on to bless them and remind them of the meaning of the Scriptures, of what’s true. There is no rush. No hurry. In other words, Jesus acts in resurrection exactly as He had in life. Nothing has changed, and yet absolutely everything has. \n\nJesus is alive! He really is. And for that reason, I can trust that the rest of my life here on earth is but a shadow of what is to come. Jesus did not hustle. He did not worry. He did not feel threatened by doubt. He simply held up His hands and said, “Here… touch.” He walked alongside His friends, and He walks with you and me, too—even if we do not recognize Him at first. \n\n“The Lord has truly been raised” (Luke 24:34), and we are not the same. So go babble excitedly like the women that first Easter morning. Run to the empty tomb like Peter. Walk at a leisurely pace with your God. Invite Him to teach you through His Word. Break bread. Take a bite of fish. Everything is different now, even the seemingly mundane. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI get hungry every time I read the Gospels. So much eating! So much cooking and drinking—the clanking of plates and the clinking of cups veritably rings off the pages! Remember when Jesus departed from the disciples to face the cross? He did so with a parting meal. When He came to them again, resurrected, He served them breakfast on the beach. It’s hard to imagine literally anything better than breakfast on the beach—two of the best things in life all at once.\n\nAt other meals, both metaphorically and with real bread, Jesus is continually feeding His sheep, because He is the Good Shepherd. He reminds us that He is the bread of life and no other food will ultimately satisfy. And when He feeds us, He is teaching us what the kingdom of heaven looks like.\n\nHis kingdom is not of this world, and man does not live by bread alone. But Christ is also the Christ of feasts. He feeds every part of us, body and soul. And when He asks Peter, “Do you love me?” He follows with this: “Feed my sheep” (John 21:17). \n\nHe asks us the same question: “Do you love me?” If so, then you also will have a heart for the flock. Others will know we are His disciples in this way, that we love one another, we feed one another, and we share with one another the true and living bread of life—as well as the bread broken together at our own dining room tables.\n\nThe beckoning call of the kingdom says, “Come, everyone who is thirsty, come to the water; and you without silver, come, buy, and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without silver and without cost!” (Isaiah 55:1). The beckoning call of Christ is this: “Come and have breakfast” (John 21:12). Both are invitations to come to Him and to His table.\n\nRobert Farrar Capon, writer and cook, understood this. In his book, The Supper of the Lamb, he says: \n\n“To be sure, food keeps us alive, but that is only its smallest and most temporary work. Its eternal purpose is to furnish our sensibilities against the day when we shall sit down at the heavenly banquet and see how gracious the Lord is. Nourishment is necessary only for a while; what we shall need forever is taste.”\n\nSince the very beginning, God has fed us, calling us to feed from Christ, from the tree of life, rather than lean upon our own understanding or depend upon the bread of Egypt (Genesis 2–3; Exodus 16:3–8). He is using food to give us a taste for the eternal. He is using food to teach us that He is good and faithful. He is using food to teach us to feed one another. At every turn, we are called to “taste and see that the LORD is good” (Psalm 34:8).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nAllow me to show you two snapshots of my life. \n\nIn the first frame, I am a new believer on a mission trip to Jamaica. Our team went door to door handing out bags of seeds and sharing the gospel with any natives who would listen, a venture that was terrifying for me. First, the idea of talking to strangers (much less strangers in a foreign country) was intimidating. Second, sharing my faith scared me so much that I lied and claimed I had the spiritual gift of intercessory prayer. While the team knocked on doors, I stood at a distance and pretended to pray. Lest you desire to give me the benefit of the doubt—don’t. I lied about spiritual gifts to get out of sharing the good news, one of many reasons I am gobsmacked by the goodness of God’s grace. \n\nSnapshot two is more recent. I was invited to speak in a remote fishing village in Alaska. I would be dropped by bush plane into a region with no phones, where I would teach a native people group who were openly hostile to the gospel. My knees still knocked. My palms were plenty sweaty. But I went and delivered the good news to anyone who would listen—and a few who didn’t want to.\n\nWhat shifted? I got a bigger view of God. \n\nHere in chapter 28, the book of Matthew comes to a close with an awe-inspiring encounter between Jesus and His disciples. It’s a moment that could have been pulled from the movie Braveheart. The disciples have already scattered in fear during Jesus’s trials. They were nowhere to be found as He was being crucified and murdered. They mourned as His body was placed in a borrowed tomb. And then… they got a bigger view of God too. They felt the earth tremble as an angel rolled the stone away. They peeked inside the empty tomb. They ran their fingers along the scars in His hands. Everything they thought they knew about Jesus expanded, because now they served a risen Savior. \n\nThat’s why, when Jesus said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me” (v.18), they knew His words were true. And when He told them to “go,” they got busy going. Believer, aren’t you glad they did?\n\nChurch, we have been commissioned to go and tell, to preach and praise, to be disciples and make disciples. And there is only one reason to do it, one truth that will get our feet unstuck: Jesus. Is. Worthy. In this Lenten season may we gain a bigger view of Him. There’s a whole world waiting for us to go and tell. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI don’t remember the first presidential inauguration I watched as a child, but I vividly remember planning to have one of my own one day—complete with an inaugural ball, naturally. Today my daughter whirls around the living room, singing the songs of Queen Elsa’s coronation day from Frozen, feeling the same flutters of imagination that I did when I watched Princess Mia crowned princess of Genovia in The Princess Diaries. \n\nWe hardly ever think of inaugurations as the end of something, but rather as the beginning. And yet, when we read about Christ’s ascension in Acts 1, it can feel like the end of His story rather than the inauguration of His kingdom. \n\nHe ascends into heaven, sits down at the right hand of the Father, and history goes on. Often, I stop there: Christ, frozen in time, seated on the throne, and waiting for His return. \n\nBut the truth is so much richer, deeper, and more beautiful than that. When Jesus ascended into heaven, He received the mantle of King over all creation.\n\nWhen Christ ascended, He did so into a cloud. Clouds are often used in Scripture to reveal God’s divine presence, from the cloud that showed the Israelites where to travel by day (Exodus 13:22), to the cloud that filled the tabernacle (Exodus 40:35), to the cloud that appeared at the transfiguration (Matthew 17:5), and the cloud upon which Jesus will descend at His second coming (Revelation 1:7).\n\nChrist’s homecoming to God in Acts 1 foreshadows our own. But the ascension is more than foreshadowing; it also inaugurated Christ’s new role as our advocate. By joining the Father at His right hand, the risen Jesus grants us access to God. On the cross, He became our substitute. At the ascension, He has become our advocate. Tim Keller writes, “When the eyes of God the Father look at you, they see the ascended Jesus; when they listen to you, they hear him.” \n\nAnother element of Christ’s Kingship on full display at the ascension was His commissioning authority. Just before He rose to join God, He commissioned His disciples to spread the gospel—not just to the Jewish people, but everyone around the whole world: to Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). Christ was claiming the whole earth as His kingdom as He rose to take His place as King. \n\nWe wait for Christ’s second coming, but today we remember the day He ascended victoriously to the right hand of the Father, inaugurating His rule as King over all His creation. We celebrate the glorious truth about His reign: \n\n“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of justice.” –Hebrews 1:8\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\n“Is He coming? Where is He?”\n\nMy daughter craned her neck, trying to see from our spot in the very last row of the very old church we sat in on Good Friday. \n\n“What?” I whispered. \n\n“Jesus! Is He here? Is that the cross? Are those His bloody clothes?” she asked, pointing to the decorative cross draped in white cloth at the front of the sanctuary. \n\nMusic started, and she returned to doodling in the bulletin. Meanwhile, I was reeling. How do I answer that? In the particularly concrete mind of a four-year-old, of course it would make sense that Jesus would be present. We remind her over and over again that Jesus is real, and He is always with us. \n\nThe jump to faith, to believing in what we have not seen, is hard to explain to her, and harder still to model. But this is the tension we hold: we believe in something we cannot see, but it is something real and present and happening right now. \n\nChrist is holding session as King over all creation. Right now. This very moment. He has since the day He ascended, and He will until the day He returns. Christ’s “session” began when He ascended into heaven to sit at the right hand of God the Father. \n\nTheologian Karl Barth wrote, “The summit has been reached, the perfect tenses lie behind us and we enter the realm of the present… Whatever prosperity or defeat may occur in our space, whatever may become and pass away, there is one constant, one thing that remains and continues, this sitting of his at the right hand of God the Father.” \n\nFrom the day Adam and Eve fell and were banished from Eden, people have been waiting for a king. David, with promised covenant kingship, knew that a greater King was coming. He wrote in Psalm 110, “The LORD declared to my Lord, ‘Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool’” (v.1).\n\nGod called together a people, first through Abraham and his descendants, and later through the apostles whom Jesus commissioned to go to the nations and invite people into the kingdom. We are now God’s people: a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, and a people for His possession. (1 Peter 2:9–10) And we are a people with a King, living by faith in the already-but-not-yet kingdom of Christ, inaugurated when He ascended to take His spot on the throne, “exalted to the right hand of God” (Acts 2:33). \n\nIn Colossians, Paul wrote that in His rescue of us, Christ has “ transferred us into the kingdom of the Son he loves” (Colossians 1:13). We, the communion of saints through the ages, live presently in the kingdom ruled by Jesus the Son, who holds His continuous session at the right hand of God. Our King holds all things together. \n\nWhen my daughter asks, “Where is He? Where is Jesus?” my answer isn’t as simple as pointing her to the front of the church. But it is an easy one: He is on His throne, seated at the right hand of God the Father, ruling His kingdom and loving His people. And our response to Him is honor, service, and faithfulness. \n\nThe sweet, sweet hymn “Fairest Lord Jesus” summarizes our posture so beautifully:\n\nFairest Lord Jesus, ruler of all nature, O thou of God and man the Son, Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor, Thou, my soul’s glory, joy, and crown. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nThe cross looms large over all of history. Its shadow is cast in all directions—forward and backward, before and behind. Every narrative in Scripture is draped in the gospel. \n\nThink back to the moment the children of Israel decided to worship a golden calf at the base of Mount Sinai (Exodus 32:1–14). God was poised to destroy them for their rebellion, and His holy wrath was fully justified.\n\nIn response, Moses turned to God, aware of how impossible it was for his people to save themselves from God’s just wrath. Unless he intervened, his beloved nation would be destroyed. In the end, the Israelites were spared, not because they were worthy or sinless (they weren’t), but because Moses pleaded for mercy on their behalf to a merciful God. \n\nAnd yet, Moses’s pleading can’t save you or me from our sin. Moses is gone, his body buried in a secret grave dug by the Lord Himself (Deuteronomy 34:5–7). Humanity’s part of God’s covenant with Moses is broken. We remain as rebellious as our Hebrew forefathers. But this is more than a story about a time when God saved a bunch of silly idol-worshippers. In the light of the cross, the image changes. True gospel hope emerges for you and for me. \n\n“These serve as a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was warned when he was about to complete the tabernacle. For God said, ‘Be careful that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.’ But Jesus has now obtained a superior ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises” (Hebrews 8:5–6, emphasis mine). \n\nChrist is our Mediator, the bridge to the better covenant. We are not—nor could we ever be—holy as He is holy (1 Peter 1:16). God’s wrath toward us is fully justified. In response, Jesus turned to face God, fully aware of how impossible it was for people to save themselves from God’s just wrath. Unless He intervened, His beloved Bride would be destroyed. \n\nAt the cross, Christ intervened for us. Yet He is not buried in a tomb. He arose with the power to keep pleading our case. Even now, this very moment, He advocates for us before the Father. He is the Savior who keeps saving us from our sin, the Mediator who keeps making our case, based on His righteousness, not our own. \n\nBeloved child of God, you have been spared. Not because you are worthy, but because Christ advocates for you. Amen. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI spent much of my twenties running a high school theatre department. We had so much fun. There are few things that bond people together like putting on a show with limited time and resources. One year we produced a spoof on Shakespeare. There was one line, shouted frantically by a young man dressed in an ornate Elizabethan dress as Juliet, that still makes me laugh: “SWEAR NOT BY THE MOON!”\n\nIn Shakespeare’s original play, Romeo and Juliet, young Juliet uses these words to warn Romeo to be careful with his vows, to not swear his love by the “inconstant moon,” which is ever-changing in its phases. Turns out Juliet’s warning is actually profound and timely advice for more folks than just Romeo.\n\nWhat we swear by is what we put our trust in, and it’s easy to misplace our trust. Maybe you don’t swear by the moon, but are you inclined to swear by your bank account, your job, your retirement plans, or your carefully scheduled week? It’s tempting to hope in things that are ultimately destined to fail, but when we try to build upon the unsteady foundation of our own whims and wistful thinking, we end up disappointed.\n\nPaul’s address to the church at Corinth, however, leaves no question about where we can lay our hope and fix our trust. He clarifies that the gospel does not fall short in any way. What is this gospel hope Paul speaks of? It is simply this: Christ was crucified for our transgressions and raised from the dead (Romans 4:25).\n\nIf Christ has not been raised from the dead, then we are much to be pitied (1 Corinthians 15:12–19). Like foolish Shakespearean moon-swearers, we have put our trust in something unreliable. How ridiculous would it be to trust in a god who dies and has no power beyond this earthly life? And so, if Christ has not been raised, then our faith in Him is as worthless as faith in the stock market or faith in the moon.\n\nBut Scripture is unequivocal: Christ has been raised from the dead. This declaration is no fool’s hope, but the sure foundation of our faith. Our faith is confirmed by fulfilled prophecy and eyewitness accounts. We can bet everything on Christ. Because “He has been raised from the dead,” we don’t have to swear by the moon or anything else. Our hope is secure in Christ’s resurrection.\n\nJesus Christ died and rose again for us. This is good news for the whole body of Christ, because “if the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole batch. And if the root is holy, so are the branches” (Romans 11:16). Because He has been raised, we who are united to Him by faith also have the guarantee of resurrection life, an everlasting and sure hope.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nCorrie Ten Boom’s memoir The Hiding Place chronicles the Nazi occupation of Holland during WWII. Under constant watch, Corrie and her family decided to form an underground network of resistance, hiding Jewish men, women, and children in homes across Holland, including their own. They knew the day would come when the Nazis would learn the truth—and soon that day came. For their crimes against Germany, Corrie and Betsey were both sent to Ravensbruck Concentration camp, where their bodies deteriorated under the weight of overwork, malnutrition, and disease.\n\nIf that were the end of the story, it would be a tragedy. But day after day, in the flea-ridden dormitory that the guards would not enter for fear of being infested themselves, Corrie and Betsey read the Bible aloud for all the imprisoned women of Bunk 28. Holding daily services, they learned that the Word of God speaks boldly, even in—perhaps especially in—the darkest circumstances. And while their health faltered, their hearts grew more convinced that they would be together with God when the ordeal was over, whether through death or through survival.\n\nOur temporary bodies hold eternal souls. My body is susceptible to illness, breakdown, injury, paralysis, and even death. But my soul is eternal. My body might stop working all together; organs might fail, and my womb may never function as it was designed to function. That is okay with me. Because my body is not me. It is a temporary home for God to do His work in the world. Even if that work is in a place I do not recognize. Even if that work is in a concentration camp. \n\nDeath—real death—is not physical. Spiritual death is eternal separation from God, and that kind of death has been swallowed up forever, because our Lord Jesus Christ took the penalty for our sin as He hung on the cross. Now, “Death has been swallowed up in victory” (1 Corinthians 15:54). So while our bodies might deteriorate, our souls will grow closer to our Creator. And one day, when Christ returns with a shout (1 Thessalonians 4:16), we will be raised to be like Him, bearing the image of heaven. “In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye… we will be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:50–52).\n\nI pray that no one will ever experience anything as cruel and inhumane as a Nazi concentration camp. But all of us will at some point experience the impact of disease, death, and disappointment on this side of eternity. Those earthly losses are deep, and our heavenly Father grieves them with us. Yet in that grief, He invites us to shift our gaze to Him, to trust that He has plans that far exceed what we can see in this world, beyond the physical realm. \n\nWhen my time comes to shed this shell, I pray that God will give me the courage to believe the truth; I lose nothing when I lose a human body, because I gain everything in Him. For the believer, Christ’s resurrection has secured eternity with Him. One day soon, He will return for us, and we will always be with Him, forevermore (1 Thessalonians 4:17). “Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!” (1 Corinthians 15:57).\n\n",

I’m sure my gracious navigator wishes I would shut up and drive, trusting that we are on the right road, and she will get us to our destination safely. \n\nThomas is a bit like an angsty driver in today’s passage. Jesus holds the GPS: “I am going away to prepare a place for you” (John 14:2). But Thomas needs more details, a specific address: “‘Lord,’ Thomas said, ‘we don’t know where you’re going. How can we know the way?’” (v.5).\n\nJesus’s answer to Thomas was simply, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (v.6, emphasis added). He did not provide Thomas with a specific address, but Jesus did point to the road that would get him there.\n\nThis is a reassuring promise to a control freak like me, and it’s as much a promise for the life to come as it is for our lives today. So often I feel like I need to know my exact destination and then figure out how to get there. Where is my career headed? How do I mend this broken friendship? Where will I live when my lease is up? Jesus may not provide specific answers, but He has asked us to believe and trust in the way He’s paved for us. \n\nWhere is my career headed?  “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” \n\nHow do I mend this broken friendship?  “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” \n\nWhere will I live when my lease is up?  “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” \n\nWant to know where your life is headed? Follow the way of Jesus. Live life in the way He told us to live it. Believe in God, believe also in Christ, and you will get to where you’re supposed to go. \n\nLiving in the way of Jesus is counterintuitive for those of us who like to both drive and hold the GPS. It requires surrender. It requires us to trust our navigator. When we do this, however hard it may be, we’re able to be present on the journey without worrying about the destination.\n\nThough we cannot point to it on a map, ultimately, we know where are headed. Perhaps we don’t know how long it will take us to get there, but one thing we know for sure: Christ our Lord has prepared a place for us there, and He is coming back to receive us to Himself (v.3). For that promise, let us say, Praise be to God! \n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Lord Is My Shepherd",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nPsalm 23 speaks to my heart—green pastures, quiet waters, right paths. I am an outdoorsy person by nature. I’d much rather get lost in the woods, alone with my thoughts, the trees, and the breeze, than be in any city. So, as I read these familiar verses, I want to go outside, to be witness to the goodness and beauty of the natural world. It also occurs to me that I have something in common with sheep—we can both get lost without hardly trying.\n\nSome years ago, I read about a Merino sheep in New Zealand named Shrek. He had wandered away from his flock and his shepherd and gotten lost. For six years, he lived in nearby caves, eating what he could find and avoiding the shearer’s blade. When Shrek was finally found, his wool weighed sixty pounds, and the raw weight of twenty men’s suits on his back was threatening his life. He had trouble walking, and his breathing was labored. He needed his shepherd. So do we. \n\nShepherds take care of sheep—plural—but in this psalm, the relationship is between one sheep and his Shepherd. It’s personal, much more intimate. “The LORD is my shepherd” (v.1, emphasis mine). These words are from David, but I can’t help but read them as my own. I think we were meant to, each one of us. The Lord is my Shepherd. He guides me, provides for me, protects me from my enemies. \n\nI don’t need to worry. “I have what I need” (v.1). I don’t need to struggle or strive. “He lets me lie down in green pastures” (v.2). Weariness does not have the final say. “He renews my life.” And I won’t ever get lost. (Not really, anyway.) “He leads me along the right paths for his name’s sake” (v.3). It is only because the Shepherd is so good that I can be still and rest, that I can have true peace. \n\nI could be happy for eternity being a beloved lamb of the Good Shepherd, but Psalm 23 doesn’t leave us as sheep. A shift occurs in verse 5. David begins to address God directly—the song becomes a prayer of thanksgiving. Not only that, but the pastoral imagery is replaced by a banquet scene. You and I have become honored guests of the King. \n\nThe table is set, and though my enemies might rage just outside, none of that matters (v.5). I am in the house of my Maker, the One who knows me and loves me better than anyone else. But the best part? I’m not just a guest. I get to stay in His presence forever—”as long as I live” (v.6), though the Hebrew phrase that’s been translated doesn’t limit this time to my natural lifespan. It has all come full circle—”I have what I need,” because I have the One I was created to know and love. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhen I was a kid, I used to be terrified that our house was going to burn down. I would lie awake in my bed, certain that at any moment I would see smoke coming from under my door, a raging fire just down the hallway ready to engulf my entire family, destroying everything in its wake. Before bed, I would ask my parents to close all the doors (to keep the fire from getting into our rooms) and make sure the oven was off, and every so often, I’d ask them to check our smoke detectors—just in case one was malfunctioning. My parents would do all of these things, lovingly reminding me that I was safe, that nothing was going to happen to me. And they would pray with me, inviting me to bring my fears and uncertainties to God, the One who protects me and strengthens me. \n\nThis psalm refers to God as the “LORD of Armies.” This name for God appears most often in the Minor Prophets, both before and after Judah’s exile into Babylon. The lives of God’s people were full of fear and uncertainty, and they were constantly reminded of the power their enemies held over them. Referring to God as the LORD of Armies reminded them of His ability to keep them from harm. \n\nThis whole psalm is a reminder of God’s unmatched power. The psalmist writes of God’s ability to provide calm and order in the midst of total chaos. The first stanza speaks of God’s protection from the natural elements, the second of God’s protection from other nations, and the third of God’s protection from fighting and wars. In every stanza, the psalmist reminds us that God is with us—that He is our refuge, that the LORD of Armies is our stronghold. How can we not bow down in praise of such a powerful God? With a God like this on our side, fighting for us, watching over us, our fears don’t stand a chance. \n\nThese days, I’m not as scared of my house burning down as I used to be. My fears are more concerned with uncertainty about the future and my need to control things. So although I am not a nation at war, I can still find rest in the fact that the LORD of Armies is with me. He is a refuge for my weary soul, a place of comfort in the midst of chaos. His power is stronger than even the most terrifying of armies, His love deeper than any raging sea. He is strong, He is good, and He will not let me go, even in the fiercest battle.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nI grew up afraid. \n\nThunder, lightning, roller coasters, car crashes, plane crashes, tornadoes—loud, violent, terrifying scenarios that kept me up at night, or in the guidance counselor’s office at school any time it stormed. I was afraid of loud things, things that threatened to crash into my life and take away someone or something I loved. I would read Bible verses that promised me safety, plucked out of the psalms and taped on my bathroom mirror in college—-verses like these from Psalm 91: “Because you have made the LORD—my refuge, the Most High—your dwelling place, no harm will come to you” (vv.9–10).\n\nThat’s a formula I tend to like, because it gives me the perception of control; I make the Lord my “refuge,” and no harm will come to me. But many years of walking quietly in sadness with people I love have taught me there is no equation to prevent suffering. Sometimes storms enter our lives quickly like thunderclouds from the west. Sometimes they sneak in, just as the sun rises quietly in the east. But always, they come, just as they came for our Savior, Jesus Christ. When the devil tempts Jesus in the wilderness, the enemy quotes Psalm 91: “He will give his angels orders concerning you, to protect you, and they will support you with their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone” (Luke 4:10–11).\n\nIn their book, The Songs of Jesus, Tim and Kathy Keller wrote: “The devil wants us to think that God’s promises have failed if he lets us suffer. But the psalm later clarifies that God will save us ‘in trouble’ and not from it.” In other words, we do not need a refuge from the quiet, the sadness, brokenness, and pain; we need a refuge from the storm that is inevitably coming (John 16:33). Suffering was sewn into our existence at the fall, but Psalm 91 shouts into the rushing wind: \n\n“The one who lives under the protection of the Most High dwells in the shadow of the Almighty.  I will say concerning the LORD, who is my refuge and my fortress …  His faithfulness will be a protective shield” (vv.1–2,4).\n\nI am thankful for the whole of Scripture, and for the ways it quiets my soul on the hardest of days. The riches of Psalm 91 are vast, with so many metaphors and names for God, calling us backward and forward through the Old and New Testaments. It does so beautifully what the whole of Scripture does: it paints a picture of our hopeless existence apart from God, and it beckons us into the fullness of life in relationship with Him. A life that, though marked with suffering, is ultimately guaranteed and secured by the personhood and work of Jesus Christ. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nOn Saturday afternoons in autumn, one of my favorite things to do is find a hearty stew recipe, throw open the windows, and stream a great playlist of folk music. I once heard someone say that beauty will save the world. I don’t know if this is true, but I fully believe that savoring the beauty in life attunes our attention to God’s goodness. It can help alleviate the darkness pressing in around us by offering a parting of the clouds—a heightened glimpse of light and hope. I can’t speak for anyone else, but I know my life can always use an extra reminder that God is working behind the scenes.\n\nPsalm 92 is said to be a song for the Sabbath. It’s a declaration of God’s justice (v.15) and His faithful love both in the morning and at night (v.2). We need songs like this, songs of Scripture, to bury inside us and remind us what’s true. This way, on an afternoon that doesn’t feel very beautiful, we can sing the song that declares God is just and advocating on our behalf for the rightness of all things. When we meditate on these songs, our hope is restored. And we can find rest again.\n\nIn this psalm, we see a lot of interesting metaphors drawn from the natural world to describe the characteristics of the righteous person. Though the wicked “sprout like grass” (v.7), the righteous will thrive like “a palm tree” or a “cedar tree in Lebanon” (v.12). The righteous are planted in the Lord like roots of a tree and will live a fruitful life, becoming “healthy and green” (vv.13–14). These arborous metaphors symbolize—and prophesy about—the vibrancy of life hidden in Christ and the nourishment He gives us, just like water and sunshine to a plant. As we pursue a life of righteousness, our legacy becomes this anthem of God’s faithfulness, declaring “the LORD is just; he is my rock” (v.15). \n\nI love how many layers are woven into this psalm. At first glance, we’re told it’s a song to accompany our Sabbath rest. But in reading the lines of verse, we detect the heartbeat behind it: a desire for all things to be made right. The only reason to declare God as “just” is if you’ve been touched by injustice and, by doing so, participate in an act of rebellion against it.\n\nYou’ve probably heard the truism: “All shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well.” It was Julian of Norwich who first said it. She was an English woman who lived a solitary life devoted to God during the Middle Ages. Psalm 92 is the undercurrent to her words. They look ahead to a time when the fullness of God’s justice will have its reign on earth, even as we usher in kingdom wholeness today. \n\nWe can find true rest in the knowledge that God is just; there is “no unrighteousness in Him” (v.15). But He also chooses to partner with us in confronting the injustices of the world. Oh Lord, Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nRemember and proclaim. \n\nThroughout Scripture, we are instructed to recall the ways God has acted on our behalf, and to share those stories of triumph and truth with others, with the next generation of believers (Psalm 145:4). The Israelites’ exodus out of slavery from Egypt? Remember and proclaim (Psalm 105:1–5). The taking of the eucharist? An act of remembering Christ’s life, death, and resurrection—all on our behalf—and proclaiming the infinite gift and power in them for those who believe in the risen Jesus (1 Corinthians 11:23–26). \n\nSo it is in today’s reading of Psalm 145, “a hymn of praise,” attributed to King David, who determines to “exalt, “bless,” and “praise [God’s] name forever and ever” (vv.1–2). Not only will he declare God’s praises, but from one generation to the next, God’s works and acts, His character, power, and righteousness, will be declared (vv.3–5). But in order for that to happen, God’s “awe-inspiring acts” and faithful love must first be remembered. \n\nThere is power in saying something out loud, in speaking truth to ourselves and to one another. Researchers in the worlds of education and psychology call this “the production effect.” Studies have shown that memory is improved by literally speaking aloud what we’re reading, thinking, and studying. The actual retrieval and recall of both past and new experiences, and the relaying of them to someone else further works to etch our experiences and knowledge into our minds. In short, if you really want to remember something, tell someone else about it. It’s incredible to think that God would design us this way, to further draw us into community to speak truth to one another (Ephesians 5:19–20).\n\nThe Hebrew word for “remember” is zakar, and it encompasses more than simply “thinking” or knowledge—it implies action. And in Hebrew tradition, practicing faith in present circumstances and exhibiting hope for the future requires that you remember God’s faithfulness in the past. What better way to remind ourselves of God’s power and steadfast love than to share our experiences with God with someone else? In looking back at God’s “great goodness and righteousness” in our own lives and in the lives of those we read about in Scripture, we are reminded that He provides what we need “at the proper time” and “[satisfies] the desire of every living thing” (vv.15–16).\n\nVerse 20 tells us when we call out to God, He is near. However, His nearness is in no way dependent upon our crying out to Him. No, He is always near, always present. When we draw near to Him, He draws near to us (James 4:8). He does not need an invitation to come to us, but in our calling out to Him, we remember that He is, in fact, a very real and present help (Psalm 46:1). Our mighty, compassionate God is delighted to be in our midst now and always (Zephaniah 3:17; Matthew 28:20). Sometimes we forget this truth, and sometimes we struggle to believe it’s true. Either way, God does not change.\n\n",

He is the Creator of everything, yet we are constrained by metaphors that come from the created world. The very idea that we might classify or categorize God is laughable. He cannot be tamed or studied. He is beyond our reach and beyond our understanding. \n\nAnd yet we can know Him. He has graciously entered our world, time and time again, so that we might be His children and His true image-bearers. He was in the garden with Adam and Eve. He spoke to Noah, Abraham, and Moses. His presence filled the tabernacle and, later, the temple. He put on flesh and became one of us. And He has gifted His Spirit to His people, in order that we might know Him more intimately still. “The LORD had his heart set on your fathers and loved them. He chose their descendants after them—he chose you out of all the peoples, as it is today” (Deuteronomy 10:15). \n\nWe can know God because He has chosen to be known. He is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-present. He is loving and just, merciful and good, and a thousand other things beside. “For the LORD your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God” (v.17). Theologians have made many a complicated list of God’s attributes, filling thick volumes on shelves that occupy the libraries of this world. But those books amount to what we can know about God. We have been given an opportunity to go much deeper than that. We have been invited to love Him and be loved by Him—to know Him in a way that defies our limited capacity for knowledge and understanding and, in so doing, bring Him glory.\n\nWhatever measure of knowledge we have about God is granted to us so that we might worship Him, not merely as admirers from afar but as dearly loved children. \n\n",

Even if we prefer to hold change at an arm’s length, it is inevitable. The seasons shift, the stars fall, our numbered hairs fall out, and our hearts undergo the only constant we know—change.\n\nThe book of Ecclesiastes contains this famous refrain, charged with the impatience, discomfort, and hopefulness of our ever-changing lives:\n\nThere is an occasion for everything,\nand a time for every activity under heaven:\na time to give birth and a time to die;\na time to plant and a time to uproot (3:1–2).\n\nWe live our lives seemingly anchored to little more than change itself. And yet Scripture beckons us to drop our anchor and hold fast to the One who never changes.\n\nOur God is unchangeable because He is perfect. Nothing can be added or taken away from Him. Everything He does is consistent with who He is. God’s promises are the same, and His ability to keep them will never waver. In Malachi 3, God tells His people: “Because I, the LORD, have not changed, you descendants of Jacob have not been destroyed” (v.6). In short, God’s immutability means we can count on Him, no matter what.\n\nJob, whose life changed in dramatic and painful ways, knew God to be always true to His character. “He is unchangeable, who can oppose him?” he asked (Job 23:13). Job staked his hope—his life—on his belief that God will always be who He declares Himself to be and do what He says He will do.\n\nJob’s hope is our hope.\n\nComplete, unchangeable, perfect—this is our God.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod is present everywhere in His creation but also above and beyond it. This remained true even as Jesus entered our world as a man and remains true as the Holy Spirit takes up residence within believers.\n\nThe Bible can be described as the story of God’s presence with His people. From walks in the garden with Adam and Eve to the incarnation to the gift of His Spirit at Pentecost, God was there. But the presence of God is not limited to any one location or situation.\n\nUsing a series of rhetorical questions, God outlines the all-encompassing nature of His omnipresence through the prophet Jeremiah:\n\n“Am I a God who is only near… and not a God who is far away? Can a person hide in secret places where I cannot see him?… Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” (Jr 23:23–24).\n\nThese verses not only show that God is both near and far, filling the heavens and the earth, but that He is always with us. There is no escaping His presence. At first, we might find this truth unsettling, but when we understand God’s heart toward His people, we can find it comforting. We echo the words of the psalmist: “But as for me, God’s presence is my good” (Psalm 73:28).\n\nGod’s omnipresence means He sees us, knows us, is with us, and will never leave us. It’s a very practical truth because the greater our awareness of His presence, the more we live with a healthy fear of the Lord. We think twice before giving in to temptation, knowing our sins are not secret. We learn to go through our day with God, abiding in Him moment by moment. We find it a natural thing to pray constantly (1 Thessalonians 5:17), because He is always right there with us.\n\nUpon completing His earthly ministry, and before ascending to heaven, Jesus promised His disciples He would send the Holy Spirit to them. His last words in the Gospel of Matthew are, “I am with you always, to the end of the age” (28:20). We experience Jesus’s constant presence through His Spirit, who lives in all believers. And one day, when Jesus returns, we will see Him not just with eyes of faith, but “face to face” (1 Corinthians 13:12).\n\n",

There is no event in the past, present, or future that takes Him by surprise. The entire universe is an open book.\n\nThis kind of knowledge in anyone else’s hands would be a dangerous weapon. It would be appropriate to live in a constant state of fear. But God’s omniscience is coupled with His other attributes. To be known by God, then, is to be valued and loved. None of us are here by mistake. He wants to know us. And that’s a very good thing; within each of us is a desire to be known.\n\nWe all want to be fully known and understood, and then to be fully loved. Of course, we too often conclude in our hearts we are unloveable. After all, we how we’ve done wrong and missed the mark, how easily we’ve given in to temptation. Our hearts condemn us daily. But “God is greater than our hearts, and he knows all things” (1 John 3:20).\n\nOn the day of Solomon’s coronation, David told his son, “The LORD searches every heart and understands the intention of every thought” (1 Chronicles 28:9). In these words, there is a warning, but there is also grace. True, there is no hiding from God. But there also isn’t anyone who could possibly know us better. Because Jesus dealt with our sin on the cross, purifying us as a bride for her husband, God’s omniscience is not reason to fear blanket condemnation; instead, it’s an invitation to true intimacy with our Maker.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod has unlimited power over all things at all times. However, He does not act contrary to His nature.\n\n“Is anything too difficult for the Lord?”\n\nThis question has a clear, straightforward answer: No. Nothing is impossible with God. His omnipotence, His all-powerfulness, is perhaps one of the first things we learn about Him. It can also be a spiritual stumbling block for human understanding, in things both trivial and serious.\n\nAlong these lines, you may have heard some form of this brain-teaser: “If God can do all things, is it possible for God to create a rock that is too big for Him to lift?” It’s a question that suspends normal logic in an attempt to stump us, but as C. S. Lewis reminds us in his book The Problem of Pain, “Nonsense remains nonsense, even when we talk it about God.”\n\nIn more serious matters—in times of grief, struggle, and loss—we wonder, Where is God in the midst of my pain? How could He let this happen? Like the disciples, we cry out, “Don’t you care…?” (Mark 4:38). We echo Martha’s sentiments from John 11, saying, “Master, if only you had been here…” (v.21). When we read these stories, we see them met with near-immediate fixes at the hand of Jesus. But we also know that God does not always stop the storm or raise the dead when we think He should. If God is able to do all things, why doesn’t He “fix” all things, already? Why let hard things happen in the first place?\n\nGod holds power over all things, governs all things, and by Him all things hold together (Colossians 1:17). And that power, that impenetrable grip on the cosmos, sustains us through every wind and wave that comes our way, whether or not we remain on our feet. In time, we begin to understand His omnipotence in light of His other attributes. God can do anything, but He does not act against His own character or nature: His goodness and justice, His mercy and love.\n\nWhile His omnipotence is a certain terror to those who oppose Him, it is a resounding comfort to His children; God is good and promises good to those who love Him. Nothing is impossible for Him, and nothing can prevent Him from achieving His good will.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod is a triune personal being who enters into a covenant relationship with His people, both individually and corporately.\n\nOur finite, human minds will never truly understand the vastness of God’s glory, nor the fullness of His character. When we consider His infinite greatness, it can be difficult to remember that while He is incomprehensibly grand, He is also personal and relational. He is Immanuel, “God with us” (Matthew 1:23).\n\nWe see this in Exodus 34, when God met with Moses on Mount Sinai. Moses came down from the mountain and found he had to conceal his face with a veil in order to speak with the Israelites. He “did not realize that the skin of his face shone” (v.29) after talking with God—that it was reflecting the radiance of God’s glory and frightening his fellow Israelites. And so, whenever Moses met with God, he would remove the veil, but then put it back on when speaking with God’s people.\n\nIn 2 Corinthians 3, Paul writes that the sacrifice of Christ and the ministry of the Holy Spirit have changed the nature of our relationship with God. We can now gaze upon the glory of God with unveiled faces, just as if we were staring into a mirror (v.18). While Moses was the mediator between God and His people, we now have Christ, the “radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of his nature” (Hebrews 1:3) as our Mediator. Because of Christ, we can enter into relationship with God both corporately as His Church and as individuals. Even more, we have received a Counselor, the Holy Spirit, to remain with us at all times.\n\nOur relationship with God is rooted in His glory and expressed in His immanence. God is present with us, deeply invested and active in each of our lives. He is a personal God. He relates to us, loves us, and cherishes us. Rather than being distant, inaccessible and detached, He has drawn near to us so that we might draw near to Him. By grace, He dwells among us, and by that same grace, He invites us into His presence.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "God Is Holy",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod is perfect, pure, and undefiled. He does not sin.\n\nAs God’s image-bearers, we’re called to reflect His holiness. God says, “You are to be holy to me because I, the LORD, am holy” (Leviticus 20:26). It is a seemingly impossible task. We have all been stained by sin and bear on our backs the weight of a sinful nature. Try as we might, we all “fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).\n\nWhen confronted with God’s holiness in the heavenly throne room, Isaiah’s response was nothing short of terror: “Woe is me for I am ruined because I am a man of unclean lips” (Isaiah 6:5). That’s how stark the contrast is between God’s perfect, holy nature and our utter lack of holiness. It’s not even close.\n\nTo be holy is to be set apart, uncommon, and raised up. God is all of these things, and we are not. But His response to Isaiah’s woeful plea was not to leave Isaiah ruined before the throne. Instead, He extended mercy and made atonement for Isaiah’s sin (Isaiah 6:6–7). God, in His perfection, has made a way for His people to be holy, for nothing is impossible with Him (Luke 1:37).\n\nBecause of Jesus’s sacrifice for us on the cross, all things are being made new (Revelation 21:5). We have been given God’s Spirit to walk with Him and practice holiness daily. Someday, all who know Christ will be perfected in Him. On that day, we will reflect God’s holiness to all creation, just as God designed it to be from the beginning.\n\nIn the meantime, God has given us the righteousness of His Son, making us holy in His sight. We are now set apart as His “holy nation” (1 Peter 2:9) and a temple for His Spirit. The holy presence of God that once made Isaiah tremble lives inside of believers. Our hope in Christ is so sure that God already regards us as people who no longer fall short, who have become holy, just as He is holy.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod is self-giving, showing mercy and grace toward all creation, especially toward His people.\n\n“God is love” (1 John 4:16). He is always loving—even when He disciplines, even when He judges. It’s who He is. And this divine love is infinite, meaning it is bigger than we could ever imagine, even if we had a thousand lifetimes with which to ponder it. If we were to taste a full dose of God’s love, it would knock us, quite literally, out of our socks. We would be unable to stand in the presence of such passion.\n\nWe were made for God’s love, so it shouldn’t surprise us that the enemy of God’s people chooses to sow doubt at this critical place in our souls. Concerning the forbidden fruit in the garden, the serpent told Eve, “God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil” (Genesis 3:5). In other words, we believe the lie that God is somehow holding out on us, that He does not really love us. It worked with Adam and Eve, and the devil has been using this same tactic ever since.\n\nWe tend to filter what the Bible tells us about the love of God through our experience of love with people who, like us, love imperfectly. The Bible gives us a definition of love in 1 John, imploring us to not define love on our own terms, through our own broken experiences, but instead to see love from heaven’s perspective: “Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 4:10).\n\nEverything God does is loving. But His love is most clearly seen on the cross, because God’s love is sacrificial. He gives Himself for the good of those whom He loves. His love for us is true. There are holes in the hands of our Savior to prove it (John 20:27). Those holes are evidence of God’s love, declaring loudly that He does not withhold a single good thing from us, no matter what the enemy may try to tell us.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod is righteous. He is the standard for all that is just and fair.\n\nWe are often unsure what to make of our just God. But His righteousness can and should be cause for celebration, a source of immense comfort in a world where earthly justice falls short.\n\nWe ache for justice when we experience the ramifications of sin, both on a personal and a systemic scale. When something we love is violated, wounded, or broken, we don’t respond with indifference—we cry out, demanding accountability. If we, with our limited perspective, are so affected by injustice, how much more does God demand justice when His standard of what is good is not upheld?\n\nGod loves more deeply and thoroughly than we could ever imagine. He loves perfectly. When proclaiming Himself to Moses, God says He is “a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love and truth, maintaining faithful love to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity, rebellion, and sin. But he will not leave the guilty unpunished” (Exodus 34:6–7).\n\nGod’s understanding of guilt is also perfect, because He is all-knowing, holy, and infinite. He has no statute of limitations. He is not swayed by false testimony or inconclusive evidence. He is the perfect witness, who searches and knows every heart, every intention, every action (Job 28:24; Psalm 69:5). He is “faithful forever, executing justice for the exploited,” even when our lives are not long enough to see it (Psalm 146:7).\n\nUnlike what we experience from one another on earth, God is not faulty or vindictive. He does not overlook sin, nor does He demand more than what is just. This is good news, because we are not only victims of sin and injustice; we are also perpetrators. And yet the steep price our guilt demands is a price Christ already paid on the cross. And “if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).\n\nJesus tells us He has been given the right to pass judgment, and that He gives life to those who hear His Word and believe it (John 5:24). Our just Judge is also our Savior. He alone can mend the brokenhearted and offer hope to the unrighteous.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod is the standard of beauty, faithfulness, kindness, and truth. He is the source of all goodness.\n\nTo say God is great is to focus on His power: He speaks creation into existence, makes the skies thunder and rain, and sets the planets in their orbits. But to say God is good is different; it is not just another way of recognizing His power. The goodness of God speaks to His personal character—who He is in relationship to us. In all ways and in all things, God is good. He is never absent, disinterested, careless, ill-tempered, petty, spiteful, or mean. He is set apart from all evil and does what is right, faithful, kind, and true. Always.\n\nTrue goodness is defined by who God is. He doesn’t just do good—He is good. In Psalm 119:68, the psalmist prays, “You are good and you do what is good; teach me your statutes.” The key to understanding the goodness of God is learning who He is through His Word. If we don’t learn His statutes, we will bring our own definitions and impose them on God. And when He doesn’t do what we think He should, we will accuse Him of failing to be “good” by our own standards—not His.\n\nIn His goodness, God gives us what we need and withholds what we do not. If we ask for bread, He will not give us a harmful serpent or a useless stone, He will give us what we need (Luke 11:11; Matthew 7:9). The God who withholds no good thing is the same God who gives no bad thing. Sometimes we don’t realize that we ask God for stones and serpents. When we ask God to give us things that are useless or harmful, the good Father refuses. As sure as He will not give a serpent when His children ask for fish, neither will He give them a serpent when His children unwittingly ask for one.\n\nYes, God is great, but He is also good. All the time and in all things. He does good because He is good.\n\n",

The rest of the morning is a blur—calling 911, then standing barefoot on a neighbor’s front lawn while the fire department extinguished flames on the house we’d finished unpacking only the day before. We’d moved more than a thousand miles to this new place and knew only my coworkers and a neighbor or two through brief introductions. \n\nPeople were quick to help. Near strangers offered us guest rooms and finished basements. A neighbor brought my daughter a stuffed animal to hold. My new coworkers showed up with lunch, and old friends sent gift cards. At one point, exhausted and spent, I found a laundry basket full of toiletries and groceries on the doorstep of our temporary residence. \n\nThe juxtaposition of kind acts against our difficult circumstances kept God, His goodness, and His constancy at the front of my mind. But now, in the safe routine of my daily life, I’m ashamed to say I go long stretches without pausing to thank God. I treat gratitude toward Him like a pile of thank-you notes I never get around to writing. \n\nMaybe the opposite is true for you. Maybe in seasons of abundance, it is easy for you to remember that every good gift comes from God; however, in seasons of sorrow, words of thanksgiving stick in your throat. Still, God’s Word to us in 1 Thessalonians 5:16–17 remains the same: It is His will for us in Christ Jesus to give thanks in everything. \n\nThe Bible presents gratitude as more than a box to check or a note to send. In each of today’s readings, we see that a grateful heart isn’t a response to our circumstances or possessions. It is a posture of worship, an active response to our unchanging God and what He has already accomplished and continues to accomplish.\n\nIn 1 Chronicles 16, David decrees that the people of God give thanks to Him in proclaiming His deeds and sharing about His wondrous works. The psalmist points to God’s faithful love and act of salvation as reasons to thank Him. Isaiah tells us thanksgiving is a privilege reserved for the living. We’re shown in these words how we can cultivate thanksgiving in ourselves by taking time to notice who God is, what He has done, and what He continues to do. \n\nGiving thanks isn’t complicated, but it isn’t easy either. It is a discipline—the habit of turning our hearts and minds to the past and present work of our good God. I pray this study of biblical gratitude will bring you peace and confidence in God’s care for you, and point you toward Him in praise and thanksgiving. We have been given so much in Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 136:1-26, Hebrews 12:28-29, Revelation 4:9-11, Revelation 11:16-17\n\nI have a three-year-old right now. (Don’t make fun of me. I’ll remove the marker stains from my table legs and find all my measuring cups when he’s older.) He loves to see things done over and over again. Horsey ride? Do it again! Final chapter of a book? Start it again! Improperly played chess game? Let’s play again! Maybe you have or know children like this—children who delight in simple things.  \n\n Author G. K. Chesterton wonderfully likened the delight of children to that of God’s joy over His creation. He described it in this way:\n\n “Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, ‘Do it again’; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, ‘Do it again’ to the sun; and every evening, ‘Do it again’ to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we.”\n\nOur Father has the energy to forever celebrate and endlessly love. And if there’s one thing that’s worth repeating twenty-six times, it’s “His faithful love endures forever” (Psalm 136:1). But the psalmist isn’t just repeating these words; he’s listing example after example of how God has shown His faithful love to His people. And this insistent repetition shows us how His love isn’t just repeated in the past, because He continues to love us in the future, again and again. Forever.\n\nWe are sinful and just tired out. We grow weary of giving one more horsey ride, handling one more irate customer, navigating another family conflict, and facing yet another rejection. But God’s love is new every morning, and our only response to His steadfast love ought to be thankfulness.\n\nThank you, Lord, for giving us another day to learn and try again.\nThank you, Lord, for giving us these beautiful children.\nThank you, Lord, for sustaining us and providing everything we need.\nThank you, Lord, for your everlasting, never-ending, never-giving-up faithful love.\n\nEven when we don’t have the energy or enthusiasm to celebrate the sunrise, let alone say, “Do it again!” in those dark morning hours, God’s love for us and for His creation is unbounded. He loves us again, and again, and again, and again. In the face of this kind of love, our hearts will warm with thanksgiving.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Chronicles 6:13-14, Psalm 100:1-5, Lamentations 3:22-23 , 1 Timothy 4:4-5, Philippians 2:1-11\n\nEvery morning, when my newborn baby wakes, his arms spring upward. His grandma says he’s growing, but what if, instead, he’s just really grateful?\n\nI’ve been paying attention, and our bodies, it seems, give thanks automatically. \n\nLittle girls twirl and giggle with the delight of being alive without ever watching a YouTube tutorial. \n\nWhen we’ve been spared a calamity or rescued from peril, our lungs naturally heave deep sighs that sound a whole lot like “Yahweh,” one of the powerful names of our rescuing God. As we age, our shoulders tend to stoop. Sure, there’s a medical reason for the change, but is it possible that age brings humble gratitude? Might we naturally bend lower as the years reveal the faithfulness of God?\n\nWe tend to think of gratitude like a greeting card, a warm sentiment sent to someone special. Or maybe it’s a journal entry, a place where we are “intentional” to write down our expressions of thanks. \n\nBut what if gratitude doesn’t require pen and paper or a stamp? \n\nHere in 2 Chronicles chapter 6, Solomon’s body seems electrified with thanks. First, he stands and spreads out his hands, gratefully receiving the gifts of God’s favor (v.12). Next, he kneels, lifting his hands toward heaven. We might expect Solomon to parade or puff up at this important occasion. Instead, he lowers his body into a posture of humility (v.13). Gratitude will do that; it knocks us out, and lays us flat. \n\nMary must have knelt before Jesus as she poured perfume on His feet and wiped them with her hair (John 12:3). Since Jesus had just raised her brother from the dead, surely Mary knew the kind of gratitude that leaves us awestruck and weak at the knees. \n\nEventually, we’ll all kneel before Him (Philippians 2:10). I’ve always assumed it was shame or sheer power that would bend our knees, but maybe not. As the beloved, adopted daughters of God, recipients of His undeserved grace, I imagine we will kneel with delight, bowled over with gratitude for the things He has done for us. Quadriplegic Joni Eareckson Tada said it this way: \n\n“On the day I receive my new body in heaven, I’m sure Jesus will be delighted to watch me stretch glorified muscles and dance on tiptoe. But there’s something I plan to do that may please Him more. I will kneel. To choose not to move in heaven will be my demonstration to Him of heartfelt thanks for the grace He gave all those many years when my legs and hands were paralyzed. It will be my sacrifice of praise.”\n\nWe don’t have to wait for the trumpet blast or the moment we are called heavenward to express our gratitude. Like my little fella greets the morning from his bassinet, let’s reach forward in praise right now, refusing to keep our thanksgiving neat and tidy, confined to a postcard or a lined journal page. \n\nMay our hearts learn to bend in gratitude to our God, for there is “no God like [Him] in heaven or on earth, who keeps his gracious covenant with [His] servants who walk before [Him] with all their heart (2 Chronicles 6:14). May we shout it from the rooftops and dance it out in the streets. May we bend our knees in humble thanksgiving, and laugh with utter delight in Him, knowing He delights in us (149:3–4).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "How We Give Thanks",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Ezra 3:11, Acts 2:42-47, Ephesians 5:15-21, Philippians 4:4-9, Colossians 4:2\n\nI was somewhat unfamiliar with the concept of spiritual disciplines until I took a class on them in seminary. In that course, we read a litany of life-changing books on prayer, fasting, Sabbath, and more. The guilt-inducing tradition of daily “quiet time” in my life was transformed into a rich and beautiful understanding of practices that led me closer to the heart of Jesus.\n\nThere are different ways to categorize spiritual disciplines, which are regular exercises that strengthen our faith. Spiritual disciplines are the stretching, sprints, pace runs, and hill drills of the Christian life.\n\nRichard Foster, who wrote the seminal Celebration of Discipline, places these disciplines into three buckets: inward (meditation, prayer, fasting, study), outward (simplicity, solitude, submission, service), and corporate (confession, worship, guidance, celebration). \n\nAs I read through today’s Scriptures, passages that show us how to give thanks, the actions of gratitude overlapped with many of the spiritual disciplines I’d studied: praise (Ezra 3:11), simplicity (Acts 2:45), corporate worship (Acts 2:46), feasting (Acts 2:46), singing (Ephesians 5:19), prayer (Philippians 4:6; Colossians 4:2). \n\nGratitude is a daily discipline that must be practiced, like stretching after a long run or racing up and down stairs to strengthen different muscle groups. It is an instruction found throughout the Bible—not a “say please and thank you” sort of direction like you would give a child, but a command to bring gratitude into every sphere of living and every moment of the day: “Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!” (Philippians 4:4).\n\nAnd so, we give thanks in practice, with actions: with praise, worship, feasting, singing, and prayer. We give thanks inwardly, outwardly, and corporately. How we give thanks reflects the One to whom we give thanks. He is an active, engaged, intimate, and corporate Father. To Him be all glory, and thanksgiving, forever. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 15:35-37, Luke 10:21-24, John 11:39-44, Luke 22:14-20\n\nOne of my pastors often quotes the Heidelberg Catechism before we receive communion: “As assuredly as I receive from the hands of the minister, and taste with my mouth the bread and cup of the Lord, as certain signs of the body and blood of Christ.” When the bread crumbles in my mouth and the wine washes it down, I think, This is how sure I am that Christ is who He says He is. For a chronic doubter like me, it has been a grace to view communion in this way. \n\nI often think of the disciples at that first communion, when Jesus took the bread, gave thanks for it, broke it, and gave it to them, saying what must have been cryptic words to the disciples, who didn’t have the advantage of hindsight we do. For them, this seemed an ordinary Passover meal. They didn’t yet know that their Father had been foretelling the story of their Messiah every year for generations. \n\nThere was another meal where Jesus took bread, gave thanks before breaking it and giving it to many, with so many leftovers they filled seven basketfuls (Matthew 15:35–37). Jesus was preaching the gospel in this meal, too, a foretaste of the last supper to come. He was showing them how breaking bread would never be the same again—not because the bread was extraordinary, but because the Blesser of it was. \n\nIn both meals, Jesus was showing His disciples that broken things aren’t the end of the story. He was essentially saying: I give thanks for the breaking about to come, because I know there is a bounty to follow you can’t even imagine. \n\nWhen you next take communion, I encourage you to feel the breaking of the bread in your mouth, to taste every crumb. And I encourage you to thank your Father, as Jesus did, knowing this mere meal points to a gospel more real than you can imagine, and a feast more bountiful than you could ever supply on your own. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 95:1-7, Luke 15:1-10, Luke 17:11-19, Colossians 1:9-14\n\nWhile we wait in the zoo parking lot, my son sits contentedly in his carseat, looking out the window. I watch countless minivans pull in. Women unload their children and strollers and other well-used zoo gear. Eventually, my friend pulls up in her own minivan, and we join the procession, pushing strollers toward the entrance. As we walk, I can see my son’s bare feet sticking out just beyond the shade of the stroller canopy. They are happy feet—slightly tanned, with little flecks of dirt caught under his toenails. \n\nFor years, this scene would have sent me home sobbing, because there was a time when barrenness felt all-encompassing. But as I look around, it hits me: he’s home. The adoption is nearly final now. I really am a mother. The wait is finally over. It’s a moment that makes me want to stop and dance. I want to stop everyone and tell them all the ways God has been faithful to me, to my husband, to our new son. \n\nSeasons of joy can feel rare in this life, but when they come, God invites us to throw a party, to celebrate His goodness. Jesus’s parables are full of parties! Have you ever noticed this? Over and over again, fattened calves are slaughtered, invitations are sent out, banquet tables are set. Jesus calls us into a joyful, hopeful, peace-that-passes-understanding kind of living that turns the music way up. He invites me to celebrate, because praise brings me into His presence. And He wants to be with me.\n\nLife is full of valleys. But it is essential to remember that valleys are made of two mountains. We may reap in tears, but joy will come. God doesn’t tell us when, but He does promise that He will restore all the years the locusts ate (Joel 2:25). And when that happens, let us not hide our joy away for fear of being boastful. The same God who mourns with us in the valley will be ready to dance with us on the mountaintop. \n\nPerhaps you don’t feel like you have the resources to praise God right now. That’s okay. God’s Word says we ought to “give thanks in everything; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus” (1 Thessalonians 5:18). Such a command might seem like a burden during a season when prayers seem to go unanswered, but it is really an invitation to freedom. Even when walking through a deep valley, we can be confident a mountain is coming. We can praise God despite our current circumstances because He is good and He does not forsake us. \n\nThis kind of praise is counter-cultural to the world we live in. It’s not intuitive. Praising like this requires practice. Partying and celebrating like this requires practice. It’s a practice of remembering that God is always with us. “Let us enter his presence with thanksgiving; let us shout triumphantly to him in song” (Psalm 95:2).\n\nThat day in the zoo parking lot woke me up. For years, I’d missed out on God’s parties. Thanksgiving is available to me at all times—whether things are good or bad, whether my heart is aching or singing. And as I walked through the zoo, listening to the animals lift their voices to their Creator, I tried to do the same. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 31:7-24, Isaiah 35:9-10, Jeremiah 31:25, Romans 15:13, James 1:2-4, 1 Peter 4:12-19\n\nI live in the heart of Missouri wine country. Weâ€™re not quite Napa Valley, but we do have grape vineyards as far as the eye can see. Each year, at our Grape and Fall Festival, we roll up our pant legs and step into giant vats of grapes, just like in my favorite episode of I Love Lucy. As the grape pulp squishes between our toes, juice runs out of spigots to be made into wine. It’s a process I enjoy during our annual town festival but struggle to embrace the rest of the year. \n\nLife hands us plenty of sour grapes doesn’t it? I’m sure I’m not alone in feeling perpetually squeezed and squashed. We can all empathize with the psalmist who wrote,\n\n“Be gracious to me, LORD,\nbecause I am in distress;\nmy eyes are worn out from frustration-\nmy whole being as well. Indeed, my life is consumed with grief\nand my years with groaning;\nmy strength has failed\nbecause of my iniquity,\nand my bones waste away” (Psalm 31:9-10). \n\nAnd yet, God calls us to face suffering with “abundant hope” (Romans 15:13), to “count it all joy” (James 1:2). Instead of pouting, wilting, or wailing in the face of sorrow, God asks us to”rejoice” (1 Peter 4:13).\n\nHow can this be?\n\nBecause He is already distilling our sour grapes into new wine. Because He promises to “satisfy the weary sou” – replenish it (Jeremiah 31:25). Redemption was purchased at the cross and will be finished when Christ returns for us. On that day, we will gather together for the marriage supper of the Lamb and raise our glasses to the God who has who redeemed our souls and our suffering. The pain that seems so palpable now, will become but a fading memory.\n\nAs we await that day, we can rejoice and be glad because God’s love is faithful. We can trust Him because He has seen our affliction and knows the troubles of our souls, and His response to our suffering is to offer us freedom that can only be found in Him (Psalm 31:7-8). Sure, we can drop our heads and keep staring at the hurt. But we can also choose to respond with thanksgiving instead, knowing that every sorrow is something God has already started to transform. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Give Thanks in Work",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Ecclesiastes 5:18-20, Genesis 2:4-9, Genesis 2:15, Nehemiah 2:11-18, Psalm 90:17, Acts 20:35, Colossians 3:17\n\nEven before the fall, we were created to work (Genesis 2:15). And while it feels good to sleep in on occasion, I believe we all can agree on the immense satisfaction that comes from work. Many of our proudest moments come from a job well done. (I’m looking at you, summer garden strawberries.)\n\nThough we were created for work, the work we have to do is not always work we love. Because of the curse, we will sometimes work really hard and see nothing for our efforts. (I mean, I planted fifty watermelon seeds and not one watermelon. I’m sure it could happen to anyone. No big deal.) For our work to be profitable, the Lord must redeem it and bless it. When everything comes together, we get to do work that we love, work that yields a good result and is blessed by the Lord. I think that’s everyone’s dream.\n\nHow do we achieve this dream of perfect work? What can we do to get the Lord to “establish the work of our hands”? (Psalm 90:17). Here’s the tricky bit. We can’t. The favor of the Lord looks different at different times, and wealth and success are not necessarily measures of His favor. Our task is to keep working with a good heart, even when the circumstances are far from perfect.\n\nThe greatest work of all is the work of our salvation. That work has already been done by Christ-all our work is secondary to His. So we work from a place of thankfulness and obedience, knowing that the greatest work is already complete.\n\nNehemiah worked from a place of trust and thanksgiving (Nehemiah 2:17-18). He didn’t know that one of the gates he rebuilt would mark the spot where Jesus would one day enter Jerusalem, riding on a donkey as the people shouted “Hosanna!” (Matthew 21:1-11). We don’t always know precisely what work we are called to do or for what purpose; I find that I rarely know. But we do know we are called to do good work, and that we are called to continue our work faithfully. We work and hope because the greatest work has already been done for us.\n\nWhether you feel you are engaged in the greatest calling of your life, every day singing with purpose, or if you are planting seeds in a garden with little hope that they will sprout, you can echo with Paul: “Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him” (Colossians 3:17).\n\n",

I resist the urge to print or laminate anything, but I almost always create a list. I do it, partly to get the most fun out of a trip, and partly because I feel awful when I don’t accomplish things. Even on vacation, I feel the need to be “productive.”\n\nThat is why I am shaken by Jesus’s words, “I do not give to you as the world gives” (John 14:27). Lately, I’ve been noticing that what the world gives me isn’t worth what it wants in return. The world asks me to hand over my time, energy, and talents in return for a tiny piece of a fading empire. And the world is never satisfied. When I give her my best, even sacrificing my health and desires, her admiration lasts but mere moments. She always wants more from me.\n\nEarly on in life, I learned to chase what the world could provide. I became a planner and an achiever. I found my worth in accomplishments, however fleeting the reward. I forgot how to be still. But the lesson I’ve been learning is that I will never find peace in the way of the world.\n\nAre you like me? Have you believed the lie of the world, that it will give you happiness if you just try harder? The message of Jesus is completely contrary to the message of the world. While the world promises happiness it will never deliver, Jesus pledges peace from His Spirit. While the world asks us to scramble like rats on a wheel, our Father God asks us to stop and rest.\n\nWe all want joy and peace, but few of us listen to the Lord’s guidance on how to get it. From the very beginning of time, God clearly commanded men and women to rest. Six days the Lord labored, and on the seventh, He rested (Exodus 20:11). He instructed His people to do the same, blessing the Sabbath day. Of all the Ten Commandments, I think our culture downplays this one the most.\n\nEven within Christian culture, we can confuse our worth with our work. Serving others is honorable, but when you can’t stop for even a day, you are listening to the voice of the world.\n\nThe almighty Creator didn’t need to rest from His work because He was weak, tired, or spent, and yet He chose to do just that. As bearers of His image, our souls were created to mirror the Lord in all things, including rest. God allows us—even commands us—to rest.\n\nThe world is a lousy gift giver. No matter what it offers us, what we really need can be found in the arms of the Father. God calls us into the rhythm He established at the formation of all things. It’s a rhythm good for our souls. The Son of God invites us to Himself, saying, “Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). Let’s give thanks today for Christ’s restful way that leads to peace.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 23:1-6, 1 Chronicles 29:10-13, Deuteronomy 6:10-15, Haggai 1:2-6, Philippians 4:12\n\nSaying thank you is something we learn to do almost as soon as we can speak. We’re taught to thank a person for things like passing the salt, blessing us after we sneeze, or holding a door open for us. The absence of a thank-you in those circumstances will most likely draw disapproving looks, and your parents’ skills in raising a decent human being will be severely questioned.\n\nThere’s an unwritten rule in our culture that when someone does something kind for us, we owe them something in return. From the time we’re little kids, we’re conditioned to offer thanks when we experience good at the hand of another. And it logically follows that the not-so-good things don’t deserve our thanks. We’re not taught to offer thanks when a stranger stumbles into us on the street, let alone when a friend offends us. And why should we say thanks? We feel slighted, and now they owe us. It seems so simple: Good things deserve our gratitude. Bad things deserve our righteous indignation—or stale indifference at best. Makes sense, right?\n\nWhen I read Paul’s words to the Philippians, I have one eyebrow raised in defiance. Of course Paul, arguably the greatest missionary of all time, has “learned the secret of being content” (Philippians 4:12). How am I, a regular girl with a regular life, supposed to get in on that secret to contentment? I fill my mind with “evidence” to prove that I should be excused from being content in every situation: unanswered prayers, a dry bank account, and broken relationships top the list of reasons I might be excused.\n\nAnd then, of course, I’m confronted with my sin once again. The Holy Spirit has a way of knocking me off my feet and onto my knees in the gentlest way. (This can leave me simultaneously exasperated and grateful, if I’m honest.) As I consider what it means to give thanks and be content in all things, I see hidden in my heart an attitude that tells me I deserve every good thing coming my way. Conversely, whenever I consider myself in a season of lack, I can start to believe God owes me for my inconvenience.\n\nYikes.\n\nWhen I actually take a minute to examine my life through the lens of the gospel, it becomes awfully clear who owes who in my relationship with God. Here’s a hint: it’s me. It’s always me. Because even in times of struggle or hardship, the fact remains that each breath I breathe is a mercy of the living God. In times of abundance and plenty, I’m still dependent on Him—nothing I have is of my own strength or ability.\n\nEverything in Paul’s life was laid before the Father, everything was offered in service. And so whatever he was forced to endure was nothing compared to the glory of a life poured out in obedience to God. That’s the secret to contentment: it’s all about God, not me. From Him, through Him, and to Him are all things. To Him be glory forever!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 94:12-15, Psalm 119:62, Proverbs 4:1-9, Ezekiel 33:7-15, Luke 17:3-4 \n\nFor the past five or six months, I’ve struggled with an insomnia of sorts. If I take a sleeping aid, I fall asleep quickly—but then wake in the middle of the night, wide-eyed and alert. If I don’t take a sleeping aid, I lay in bed for hours with my mind racing. I should put a little notebook at my bedside where I can jot down all the brilliant ideas I’ve had as my husband and pup snore softly in the darkness of our room. I would probably be more productive in the morning, armed with a list of midnight solutions.\n\nAlong with those sleepless moments of clarity, though, there have been painful realizations about my character and personality—things I’m less likely to want to collect in a bedside notebook. Areas of my heart where fear, guilt, or shame arise. Places I’d rather the Lord not see or address in my thought-patterns or ruminations. I feel my frailty in those night-time hours, far more than I feel them the following morning.\n\nDavid, too, knew the vulnerability of the night and of God’s discipline to him in it.\n\n“I rise at midnight to thank you\nfor your righteous judgments.” \n–Psalm 119:62\n\nIn sleeplessness, David—the one after own God’s heart, whom God relentlessly pursued for His purposes—thanked God for His righteous judgments. He thanked God for keeping His promise to deal with sin, to not overlook it. The fact that God disciplined David for his sin and it kept David awake at night, shows God to be attentive to sin and to His children who wrestle with it.\n\nJesus Christ has taken our punishment in full, the recompense for our sin. But the pressing discipline of God, shaping and forming us more in His likeness, is the promise of the Father to all His children (Hebrews 12:6). In Psalm 94, David speaks again of the Lord’s discipline, describing it as a “relief from troubled times” because “the administration of [His] justice will again be righteous, and all the upight in heart will follow it” (vv.13.15). And so by pressing in to God’s discipline, instead of away from it, we will gain His wisdom and understanding—“a garland of favor” on our heads, a “crown of beauty” (Proverbs 4:1–7).\n\nI don’t know when those moments of restlessness and conviction happen for you, when you see the discipline of God as both painful and good, difficult and righteous. Maybe it’s when you’re up late into the dark morning hours. Or perhaps when you are confronted with a difficult situation or person. Or maybe it happens when you’re simply bored or sad, withdrawing just enough to finally be still and listen.\n\nI can choose to be thankful for God’s attentiveness as He reveals my heart to me, or I can continue to run from His discipline. But I want be like David, instead—intentional with my waking moments and grateful to God that He never sleeps or slumbers through my life (Psalm 121:4). He is always with with me, ready to awaken me to His righteous judgments, which are always for my good and His glory.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 7:36-50, Ephesians 2:4-10,  2 Corinthians 4:7-15\n\nWhen was the last time you kissed someone’s feet? When was the last time that you had enough tears to wash… anything?\n\nThis story in Luke 7 exists to show us a genuine response to God’s overwhelming mercy. I wonder what commotion this woman’s weeping must have made at the Pharisees’ table. Imagine her there on the floor, openly weeping in front of strangers. She disregards their disapproval and makes a radical display of devotion. Jesus bends down, looks her in the eyes and holds her hand. Then He wipes the tears from her face and tells her the truth: Her weeping is not in vain. Her sins are forgiven. She came in weeping, but can go out rejoicing.\n\nMeanwhile, the hosting Pharisee does not ask who she is, what she’s doing, or why she’s doing it. He doesn’t provide her a seat at the table. He assumes that since he knows about her past, he knows everything about her future too. He talks about her, but doesn’t care for her. He judges her by what she’s done, not by what God will do for her. He’s misses the miracle. But when Jesus looks upon this weeping woman, He sees the beauty in her sacrifice and in her heart. When Jesus sees her, He offers her abundant mercy and a new identity.\n\nThis is our God! When I humble myself before Him, He forgives everything and puts my feet on a whole new path. When Jesus explains His parable of the creditor with two debtors to the Pharisee, He says, “Her many sins have been forgiven; that is why she loved much. But the one who is forgiven little, loves little” (Luke 7:47–48).\n\nThis woman isn’t a worse sinner—she’s a better seer. Unlike the Pharisee, she sees her sin for what it is. She knows her debts and doesn’t try to minimize them. Rather than trying to hide her mistakes, she grieves openly for how she’s failed. In using the parable, Jesus is inviting the Pharisee to see his sin with a clearer vision, to see that the molehill of sin in his heart is actually a mountain. Right perspective on the magnitude of sin leads to a radical posture of gratitude toward God.\n\nJesus isn’t saying we need to sin more in order to love Him more. He’s inviting us to see the evil of our sin without mitigation. Only after taking a brutally honest look at ourselves will we be able to appreciate the merciful, caring, forgiving gaze of our Savior. He lovingly looks us in the eyes and gently wipes away our tears. He sets our feet on new paths. May we focus on that change today and, with grateful hearts, thank Him for all He’s done for us.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Give Thanks in Anxiety",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: Habakkuk 3:17-19, Matthew 6:25-34, John 6:4-14, 1 Peter 5:6-7\n\nThinking back over the course of my life, I can’t remember a time when anxiety hasn’t been present. As an anxious kid, I used to stay up at all hours of the night, terrified that our house was going to burn down. Though wildfires aren’t normally a concern in Alabama, where I grew up, the fear of fire fed my anxiety throughout my childhood and shifted into other worries as I got older.\n\nWhen I started driving, I worried about whether or not I’d closed the garage door after pulling out of the driveway. When I moved into my own apartment, I worried about whether I’d locked the door, or left the stovetop on, or—Oh my goodness, did I unplug my curling iron, or is it going to be sitting too close to that hand towel and burn the whole building down?\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nThe simplicity of the heading from today’s reading in Matthew 6 grabbed my attention and made me pause. “The Cure for Anxiety,” huh? If there is one, I sure haven’t found it, I thought. After so much time in therapy, I’d tried and failed to do the seemingly impossible: cure my anxiety.\n\nI don’t know about you, but over the years, I’ve been taught that if I can just conjure up more faith, just pray more, the anxiety will go away. For a long time, I thought I was a “bad Christian” because I couldn’t just “let go and let God,” like all the inspirational quotes on Pinterest told me to.\n\nGiving thanks in the midst of anxiety isn’t about a cure for worry or a band-aid for the bullet hole of thoughts spiralling out of control. It’s about recognizing the majesty, sovereignty, and power of the God we serve. This is what Jesus says to us about our anxiety:\n\n“Therefore I tell you: Don’t worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Isn’t life more than food and the body more than clothing? Consider the birds of the sky: They don’t sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you worth more than they?” (Matthew 6:25–26).\n\nAs someone dealing with an anxiety disorder on a day-to-day basis, I know that if I take a minute to step back, place my feet firmly on the ground, and take a deep breath, I will find a great deal of comfort in these verses. There is comfort in the knowledge I serve a God who loves me and knows me more intimately than I could ever imagine—He knows exactly what I need (v.32). And so, even when my circumstances feel overwhelming, I can look to the God who sees me and calls me His own, and I can celebrate Him and the peace His salvation brings me (Habakkuk 3:18).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Give Thanks in Waiting",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: Isaiah 40:27-31, Luke 2:25-36, Romans 8:18-28\n\nJust wait on God.\n\nEasier said than done, right?\n\nIn Isaiah 40, I see a promise-making God, who has existed forever, created everything, knows—literally— everything. If I were a betting woman, I’d put every dollar in my bank account on any promise that the God with those qualifications made. With a résumé that stacked, I would be making the safest bet in the universe. All power belongs to God, and He’s promised to share it with us. In verse 31, there’s a promise for those who wait on the Lord:\n\n“But those who trust in the LORD will find new strength. \nThey will soar high on wings like eagles. \nThey will run and not grow weary. \nThey will walk and not faint” (Isaiah 40:31, NLT).\n\nGod has promised to strengthen His people while they wait through the power of His Spirit. I’ve experienced the fatigue that comes from continuing to hope in the Lord—trusting in His promises, but failing to see their tangible manifestation. And while weariness will come, I can testify that the Holy Spirit has always provided me with the supernatural strength to endure.\n\nSimeon is an exceptional example of the Holy Spirit’s power to increase a person’s capacity for waiting. Scripture tells us God had made Simeon a promise: he would not see death before seeing the Lord’s Messiah (Luke 2:25–26). By the Spirit, Simeon was imparted with the supernatural strength, patience, and faith to believe God’s promise—the promise that was fulfilled in the Christ child resting in Simeon’s aged arms. Still, I wonder if he ever became weary as he hoped for Israel’s consolation. Imagine the overwhelming joy in his heart when he realized the long-awaited Messiah had finally come!\n\nIn Romans 8, the apostle Paul reminds us that our hope and expectation shouldn’t be reserved for this present world, in what we can see and touch. For “hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience” (vv.24–25). These words written by the apostle Paul were meant to encourage persecuted Christians living in Rome—to redirect their hope and longing to the promise of the world to come, where the kingdom of God reigns without limit or exception. May God use Paul’s words to do the same in you and in me.\n\nBelievers everywhere, along with all the rest of creation, are waiting with eager expectation for the redemption of all things (vv.22–24). When Christ returns, every wrong will be made right and every tear will be wiped away. There will be no hunger or thirst, no war, depression, or despair. Our hearts may grow weary with the state of this world, but we can rejoice while waiting for the glory of its redemption (and the fullness of our own!), because God’s strength gives us power to wait. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "In Everything, Give Thanks",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 5:12-28, Psalm 105:1-6, Micah 6:8, Colossians 3:12-16\n\nThis summer we drove from Tennessee to California in a shuttle bus. My one caveat as we planned the trip: I can’t handle this while pregnant! But two weeks into our travels, I sat down in the back of the bus as we bumped along the highway through Fargo, North Dakota, and started doing some figuring, resulting in the words, “Husband! Stop the bus!”\n\nAn eighty-eight-cent pregnancy test told us I was pregnant. So there we were, in the middle of the country—just as far from home as we were from our vacation destination—hearts full of joy with the best secret. It wasn’t what we’d planned, but we’ve found it’s so easy to be thankful for good surprises.\n\nThere are so many things that do not go as planned. For me, these unexpected circumstances have often been of the pregnancy-related variety. Here’s the thing: growing our family has never gone as we’d planned.\n\nI imagine you’ve experienced this too. The college you planned on going to wasn’t the one you actually attended. Your high school sweetheart ended up marrying someone else. You entered into a six-month-long interview process but didn’t land the job. You had far less time with a parent or a child than you ever could have imagined. We’ve all experienced a change of plans, a change of expectations. Still, somehow, in the midst of things swerving left when we were expecting them to turn right, we’re called to give thanks:\n\n“Rejoice always, pray constantly, give thanks in everything; \nfor this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus” (1 Thessalonians 5:16–18).\n\nIf we are to rejoice always, that means our rejoicing cannot be dependant upon our circumstances. If we are praying constantly, that means we ought to be praying even when we feel that things are going well, like we’ve got everything under control. If we are giving thanks in everything, that means we’re thankful not just on Thanksgiving Day, but also when things don’t go the way we had planned.\n\nBut how? How can we give thanks in all circumstances? How can our thankfulness be ongoing? It’s far too easy to slip into a lazy, lip-service kind of thanksgiving. Or to read 1 Thessalonians 5 and feel the pressure to give thanks in spite of what’s happening. But we aren’t only called to give thanks in spite of what’s happening; we’re called to give thanks because of our God—because this is His will for us in Christ Jesus.\n\nThe foundation of a life of thanksgiving is seeing God for who He is. It is keeping our eyes fixed on Christ. When He is front and center, there is always abundant reason for thanksgiving. No circumstance or surprise, whether welcome or scary, is able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.\n\nSo let us give thanks to the Lord and call on His name. Let us sing to Him, praising and proclaiming His goodness. Let us honor and seek Him above all else—because, regardless of our circumstances, our God is always worthy of our gratitude (Psalm 105:1–5).\n\n",

The Israelites adapted the name Elohim from El, an ancient word for “god,” to refer to the one true God. This name emphasizes His greatness and majesty over all creation and all other gods. Throughout Scripture this name is paired with descriptive words to distinguish God and His character from pagan gods (e.g., El Olam, “everlasting God,” El Roi, “God who sees,” and El Rahum, “merciful God”).

Adonay is a reminder that we serve a holy, sovereign God who is Lord over all.\n\nKurios, or “lord” in the New Testament, was used to show respect to people with authority like emperors or masters. It is used to describe both God the Father and Jesus the Son in the New Testament. When followers of Jesus called Him “lord,” they showed Him honor. In Paul’s letters, he used the word as a title for the risen Jesus. “Lord Jesus Christ” became a primary way to refer to Him, implying He shared the authority of the God of Israel.

The name carries a sense of nearness, including intimate knowledge of the needs, struggles, and hopes of humanity. When Isaiah prophesies about the virgin birth, he says that her child will be called Immanuel. This is not a proper name as much as it is a description of what the Messiah would be like. \n\nIn Matthew, an angel tells Joseph to name the child Jesus, because “He will save His people from their sins” (Mt 1:23).

The Israelite God was—and is—living and active in and among His people. Similarly, the name “God Most High” elevates the God of Israel over all other gods. These names are reminders that God is active and superior to all other objects of worship. \n\nEmphasis\n\nGod’s superiority over all other gods and idols\n\nReflection\n\nWhat do these names teach me about God?\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer Praising God’s Greatness",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 145:1-21\n\nPrayer is a startling invitation—one that, after 30 years of following Jesus, I still struggle to accept. \n\n“Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and incomprehensible things you do not know,” the Lord says to His people in Jeremiah 33:3. The book of Hebrews urges the Christ follower to “approach the throne of grace with boldness” (4:16), and Paul tells the Philippians not to worry about anything, but instead to petition God in prayer (4:6). Perhaps most astonishing of all, Jesus Himself instructs His disciples, “Whenever you pray, say, Father…” (Luke 11:2). \n\nCall out to God. Go boldly to the throne. Ask instead of worry. Talk to God as your Father. \n\nThis is the invitation. But what do we say? How do we find the words to pray? \n\nPrayer, like everything else in the Christian life, is a practice learned over time. When it comes to learning the language of prayer, there is no better classroom than the Psalms. The book of Psalms was the hymn and prayer book for the people of God before the days of Jesus. God’s people have been praying these writings, and using them to shape their own prayers, ever since. \n\nTake Psalm 145, for example. This hymn written thousands of years ago by the shepherd-king David teaches me how to express praise to a God who is magnificent beyond words. I often fumble at the beginning of my prayers, unsure how to address this Being who is so holy and so wholly other. But this psalm puts words to God’s greatness, giving me vocabulary to praise the Lord’s “splendor and glorious majesty” and declare His “awe-inspiring acts” (vv.5–6). It reminds me of the power of speaking back to God the immutable aspects of His character: He is “gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in faithful love” (v.8); He is “good to everyone” and “gracious in all His actions” (vv. 9,13). It gives me the scaffolding on which to build my own song of prayer to the Lord who is “near to all who call out to him, all who call out to him with integrity” (v.18).\n\nIn this three-week Psalms for Prayer reading plan, we’ll read fifteen psalms that cover a range of topics, from glorifying God, to praying for our personal concerns, to lifting up the needs of this world. Some of these psalms are worded as prayers offered directly to God; others act as prompts to inspire prayer. All are given to us in God’s complete, inerrant Word. The God to whom David wrote this ancient psalm is the same God you and I pray to today. His Word not only teaches us who He is; it teaches us how to commune with Him in prayer.\n\nMay God use our time in these psalms to reveal to us more of His character. May He draw us into a daily and ongoing conversation with Him, and may His Word teach us to express our hearts to Him in prayer.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer Celebrating God’s Creation",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sandra McCracken\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 104:1-35\n\nI think children often imagine themselves as the center of all things, even the weather. And I think there’s something commendable about their curiosity, how they can attune their hearts and minds to what surrounds them. Psalm 104 gives me the impression that this is a God-inspired curiosity. Here, the psalmist wills his own soul to consider the beauty and majesty of God, and in doing so, his soul is moved to worship our Creator and admire His creation. \n\nHow countless are your works, Lord!\nIn wisdom you have made them all;\nthe earth is full of your creatures (v.24).\n\nIn truth, it is the Creator who is at the center of creation. God’s glory is revealed in what He has made: in the intricate and majestic beauty of His creation surrounding us. His artistic display is also wrapped up in His very essence, His radiant splendor, and His steadfast character. He wears His creation like a garment and commands it masterfully, setting up the edges between water and land, day and night. His boundaries are loving and lavish. Every green leaf and delicate creek seems full to the brim, right up to the edge of wherever He has ordered it to stop.  \n\nGod Himself takes pleasure in His own creation because it is an expression of His glory, and as His image-bearers, we too, ought to delight in what He has created (vv.31,33). And just as He is everlasting, His works will never cease to praise Him. “He established the earth on its foundations; it will never be shaken” (Isaiah 40:28; Psalm 104:5).\n\nHe wraps Himself in the beauty of creation because He is the holy, nourishing, life-giving presence inside the beautiful cup of creation. His Son Jesus was poured out for us that we may be filled with the finest provision of all—our salvation (Isaiah 53; 1 Corinthians 11). When we take communion, we remember with all our senses that He is our nourishment, that He alone gives abundant life. He alone sustains us, forgives us, and makes us new.\n\n In this mystery, we are planted on this earth, given an address, and we also find ourselves wrapped in the beauty of His creation—from the moment we walk out our front door in the morning to feel the fresh air on our faces and hear the birds singing their morning song. Even this is His provision for us, just as we are nourished daily by His Holy Spirit, feed on His Word, and walk in His presence. \n\nOur God makes Himself known to us in the song of creation and has demonstrated His splendor in every wild beast, in the sound the thunder, in the messages of the wind, and in the blue sky canopy above us. In all of this and more, from start to finish, my heart sings out in celebration with the psalmist to say, “Bless the Lord, O my soul! Praise the Lord!” (v.35).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer for When God Seems Silent",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 77:1-20\n\nI got the call on a Tuesday. The son we were going to graft into our family through adoption was now staying with his biological family, to be raised by his grandmother. I had already packed a bag for the hospital. We were less than a week away from his due date, and now, there was no due date in sight.\n\nIt’s hard to describe the pain of that moment. Four years of infertility. Months of adoption preparation. All the finances invested in growing our family disappeared in an instant, but that paled in comparison to watching our future go up in smoke. The little boy I’d pictured standing between my husband and me, with this dark skin and curled hair, was gone. The thoughts kept pounding at the place between my eyes: I’ll never know what he looks like. I’ll never even know his name.\n\nI’ll be honest: in the moments after that call, I didn’t open up the psalms. Instead, I walked upstairs to the little nursery we’d yet to complete and grabbed the handmade quilt my mother’s best friend had made for the boy. It was meant to warm him as he slept, but now I buried my face in it and wept. I screamed. No one was home but me, and so I let myself go—until my throat quivered and the cries sounded eerily like that of a child wailing for its mother. \n\nThe Message translation of Psalm 77 says, “I yell out to my God, I yell with all my might, I yell at the top of my lungs… my life was an open wound that wouldn’t heal” (vv. 1-2). I know what that feels like. I’d guess many of us do. But how often do we give ourselves permission to yell and cry out like this? How often do we express our sorrow and the fullness of our pain? Not often. \n\nIn an effort to bypass our grief—in fear that God’s silence will be too much to bear—I believe many of us never ask the questions the psalmist so brutally lays down: Where are you, God? Have you forgotten me completely? I thought you were supposed to be compassionate. But this doesn’t feel like compassion.\n\nInstead, we try to end the pain as quickly as possible, either through secular comfort (read: retail therapy) or spiritual practices (read: small groups, counseling, meditation, and yes, sometimes even Bible reading). But Psalm 77 shows us that we can bring our raw emotion to God. We can ask our honest questions without fear. We can scream at the top of our lungs, and God will still listen.\n\nBut the psalmist does not stop with his questions. He asks them, and then he gets up off the floor. It is essential that we bring our honest selves to God, in all our brokenness. But it is just as essential that we are honest about who God is to us. In a place of pain, truth is a hard pill to swallow. But it is the medicine we need most. We need to remember that all His ways are good, even in the midst of our sorrow and pain. The Message translation of the psalm goes on to say:\n\nOnce again I’ll go over what God has done, lay out on the table the ancient wonders; I’ll ponder all the things you’ve accomplished, and give a long, loving look at your acts (vv. 11-12).\n\nI have a history full of examples to pick from to remember God’s character. After all, the psalmist didn’t know Moses and Aaron—he wasn’t present when God parted the Red Sea—but he praised God for it anyway. Jesus hasn’t ended my sickness, but the stories of when He walked on earth prove that He is our Healer. The ancient wonders remind me of the truth: my current circumstances do not outweigh God’s eternal promises.\n\nThis is the rhythm of faith. Yell out, and then remember.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer Celebrating God’s Word",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 119:1-32\n\nWhen we lived in town, I would occasionally notice an uncanny quiet in the house, and then realize that one of my little boys had escaped. Every Thursday was trash pick up, and the siren song of the garbage truck often proves too strong for the will of toddler boys. Racing after a child who is wandering down the street—myself dressed only in my best approximation of “this will do”—is a harrowing experience. Since we’ve moved out to the country, my fellas are still entranced by all classes of trucks, but now they line up at the fence and shout their admiration from a safe distance.\n\nYou read what makes all the difference, though, right? It’s the fence. In town, all of Franklin, Tennessee, was open to us; it was just a matter of how far we wanted to walk. There was nothing to stop us. But the kids had to stay close to the house. Out in the country, while we only have two acres (my dream come true), they are allowed to enjoy every inch of those acres. The boundary of the fence gives them huge freedom. As long as they stay inside the fence, they are safe.\n\nThere is such a joyful freedom in boundaries. Psalm 119 celebrates the gift of God’s law by extolling the beauty and truth of God’s Word. In fact, that’s the primary focus of this psalm—celebrating God’s law and the boundaries it gives. And it’s given as prayer, which means this psalm is a treasure for teaching us how to pray prayers which delight in surrendering to God’s Word and will. God’s law hems in our lives so that when we are lured by garbage trucks, or whatever delights the world has to offer, we can see exactly how we are to respond. There is such safety in knowing where the lines are, instead of huddling close to the house, unsure of how far we can go. \n\nThroughout this psalm, we encounter a series of refrains—“teach me your decrees,” “I love your law,” “I will not forget your law”—which spill out like shouts of joy. The psalmist is so captivated by the goodness of God’s law, that he cannot help but declare it. He sings of God’s law as if were the very air he breathed. God’s law is the law of love, the law of liberty, the law of life. May we find our delight in his degrees! May it frame our every thought, our every breath. \n\nR.C. Sproul calls the law the “school of righteousness.” Within this school, we learn what pleases God and what offends Him. What a severe joy and a mercy it is to have God’s law, to know where to set our sights, where our boundaries lie, and enjoy the wide freedom within His gates.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer When Battling Anxiety",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 27:1-14\n\nPerhaps you’ve heard it said that in a storm, any harbor will do. When the tidal waves of life threaten to capsize our little ships, we will look anywhere for respite, often seeking shelter in places that cannot ultimately protect us. Age has alerted me to an alarming truth: the waters of life are almost always choppy. Smooth-sailing days are rare in a world as broken as ours.\n\nHere in Psalm 27, we see David sending out the distress signal. He is looking for a lighthouse to point him toward shore. He starts with a pep talk, saying, “The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?” (v. 1). But the answer to his question must have made his knees wobble. I can imagine him now, penning words of praise with one hand, while anxiously chewing his fingernails on the other.\n\nThrough the storm of his own anxiety, he saw an army positioned to take him out. In David’s case, this army may have been literal, but we all know how it feels to be surrounded, hard pressed on every side (2 Corinthians 4:8). We see serious threats against our hearts and homes every day. But we can’t fight our fears by convincing ourselves there’s nothing to be afraid of. There is! The list of rational fears is so significant, there’s not a bucket of sand big enough for us to bury our heads and fully hide from the threat.\n\nRecently, in my own life, physical, relational, and emotional forces collided to create the perfect storm. Many of my worst fears were realized, and my anxiety that there was more to come left me frantically searching for safe harbor. As all other life rafts sunk around me, I finally clung to God’s Word. As His truth anchored me, I found myself locking eyes with the disciples when they faced the storm.\n\n“And they woke him and said to him, ‘Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?’ And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, ‘Peace! Be still!’ And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. He said to them, ‘Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?’ And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, ‘Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?’” (Mark 4:38-41 ESV, emphasis mine).\n\nAny hope that we can calm the storms of life on our own is misplaced. We cannot. But we will find ourselves buoyed when we look for the One no storm can stand against. Ultimately, the disciples clung to the same truths that David did—the same truths that you and I can cling to:\n\nGod is faithful.\nHis care is relentless.\nHis promises are true.\nHis presence is the only place where our fears truly subside.\n\nOur hope is not that the day of trouble will not come, because it will. But our God will see us through. No calamity can untether us from God and His Word. Never. When anxiety twists our stomach in knots, when we look around and see an army of threats, not just any harbor will do. But this one will:\n\nThe Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; he knows those who take refuge in him (Nahum 1:7).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer in Times of Sorrow",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 86:1-17\n\nThere was a season of my life when it seemed like weeping willows were suddenly sprouting on every corner. At the time, I had just taken up a new habit of running and can remember having to duck my head and step carefully on the trails so as to not tangle my feet on their branches. An artist like DaVinci or Monet probably would have been inspired by their presence. Unfortunately, I’m not the kind of girl who thinks poetically about things like pollen. I’m more prone to believe the trees are just standing in my way.\n\nThat’s exactly how I feel about sorrow—it had better stay in its own lane. I wish my experience with sorrow was only as extensive as a good cry at the end of a sad movie. But the truth is my shoulders have been crushed by the weight of grief, leaving me to feel like a weeping willow: arms fallen, exasperated, feeble. I’ve tried not to give myself over to the weight of my sadness for fear I won’t be able to stand back up again.\n\nIt’s easy to see why we call them “weeping” willow trees. They were first given their name because of the way rain falls from their branches resembling tear drops. However, they grow best near water, able to absorb large quantities of water during floods. In fact, when strategically planted beside ponds, they can even help to prevent ground erosion. And in a way, our sorrow is like that too. Avoiding it may appear to be the best survival tactic, but taking it in and then bringing it honestly before God is one way He strengthens and grows us.\n\nProtect my life, for I am faithful (Psalm 86:2).\n\nI used to think weeping willows looked like crippling sorrow, the kind you never fully recover from. They seemed to be consistently sad, their branches swaying on the ground in the wind. Yet, now I wonder if the posture of a weeping willow tree isn’t so much a picture of what sorrow does to us, as it is an image of what we’re to do with our sorrow. Heads bowed in submission to the Lord, we can expose the depth of our sadness to Him without hesitation.\n\nAll the nations you have made will come and bow down before you, Lord, and will honor your name (v. 9).\n\nDespite their appearance, weeping willows are one of the fastest growing trees around, gaining 8 to 10 feet per year. This rapid growth may be one of the reasons they have a relatively short life span. But to me, somehow this signifies the promised end of our sorrow. While the layers of sadness that fill us here on earth are many, joy is our eternal posture.\n\nLord, give strength to your servant (v. 16).\n\nSorrow stretches us in ways we probably wouldn’t ever choose for ourselves, but it strengthens us all the same. Deep sorrow makes way for great joy. By His grace, may we embrace the sorrow that seems to stand in our way, allowing it to remind us of God’s kindness, of how He strengthens, comforts, protects, and renews us. In this way, our hope and joy are not far off and distant, but present with us each and every day, just as He is. Amen.\n\nBring joy to your servant’s life, because I appeal to you, Lord (v. 4).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer for Mercy",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 6:1-10\n\nWhen I was a high school senior, I audited an upper-level English literature course at a local college. The professor assigned two novels, both of which were written in 18th-century English, and extremely hard for this 18-year-old to decipher. Luckily, the professor explained each reading at length, and though much of that course has disappeared from my memory, I’ll never forget a quote from George Eliot’s Middlemarch. For some reason, it implanted itself in my mind, and I doubt it will ever leave. It reads:\n\n“If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence.” \n\nWhat I take from that quote is this: If we could hear “all ordinary human life” it would be deafening. Can you imagine hearing everything? From the simple growth of the grass all around us, to the cries of children in the night from hunger, to the millions upon millions of groans that go up to the Lord each moment? I cannot fathom the sound.\n\nThat’s why, when it comes to Psalm 6, I know I’m on holy ground. \n\nI don’t know for certain what left David so shaken that he wore himself out with groaning—although, there are plenty of scenarios to choose from in 1 and 2 Samuel. His best friend’s father was trying to kill him. He had to hide away in enemy territory for decades. The only men who went with him were desperate, indebted criminals (1 Samuel 22:2). In many ways, he was alone in the world.\n\nI don’t know exactly why David wrote this psalm, and I don’t know how you’ll relate to it, either. Perhaps the imagery of crying nightly against your pillow is no imagery at all. Perhaps that’s your reality. Marriages falter under the weight of years of sorrow. Children defy our expectations and hopes. Relationships plunder our hearts, leaving us to clean up the wreckage. Even the best, most hopeful times of our lives, leave us wondering what lurks around the next corner. \n\nIf your eyes are open, if your heart is beating, you know that life is full of perpetual ache. Like George Eliot said, if we could hear it all, “we should die of that roar.” But here is the beautiful thing about our God: He hears every single prayer. He catches our tears in His bottle (Psalm 56:8). And though we are unable to bear the weight of that much sorrow, He can. And He has (Isaiah 53:3-4).\n\nAfter reading the seven preceding verses about grief, I love the final three in this psalm, how the idea of hope emerges from them. I can imagine David writing them, taking a deep, post-cry breath—you know the kind. Maybe it’s still shaky. But it fills your lungs with oxygen and enables you to sit up straight and wipe the tears from your eyes. David rises to face his fears, not because his circumstances have changed, but because he is confident that the Lord has heard his weeping, and accepts his prayer (Psalm 6:9).\n\nWhatever tears you are shedding today, rest in confidence that the Lord hears you clearly. He knows you, accepts you in Christ, wants to commune with you, and longs to be gracious to you, even in the darkest hours (Isaiah 30:18).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Wynter Pitts\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 23:1-6\n\nHave you ever had everything you’ve ever wanted, yet still felt unhappy? I have. At the time, I was fully aware that most people would take one look at my life and suggest that I had everything I needed, but somehow it didn’t feel like enough. It wasn’t that I was ungrateful for what I had, I just wanted—longed for—something more, something else. \n\nI will never forget that morning when I woke up, looked around my bedroom and burst into tears. I was married to a wonderful man. I was the mom of four healthy, happy daughters. I had friends and family that loved me, and although our lifestyle was not lavish with shopping sprees and shiny things, we were able to live on a single income—just one of the many answered prayers that had filled that season of my life. And in that moment, right outside my closed bedroom door, I could hear my husband of six years, giggling and enjoying an easy morning with our girls—more answered prayers.\n\nSo why was I crying? I felt empty and alone, and I felt guilty about both. Although my tears were streaming from a place of discontent, they were also layered with the guilt from the reality of those feelings. I was ashamed to acknowledge that answered prayers had landed me in one of the most uncomfortable seasons of my life. It seemed as if all I had prayed for was still not enough to fill me up and grant me what I thought it might deliver. It was in this very moment that God reminded me of what I was desperately seeking. It was a void His presence alone could fill. \n\nI wasn’t looking, but He found me. I wasn’t asking, but He gave me more in a moment than I would have ever asked. I was reminded of these words:\n\nThe Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing (Psalm 23:1).\n\nAs simple as they are, these words penetrated my soul and began to take up new real estate in my heart. God had answered many of my prayers, yet I’d failed to realize that His promises do not always arrive on smooth paths. But regardless of circumstances, He does promise to provide His comfort the way a good shepherd does—with a little pulling, prodding, and nudging in the direction He knows is best. The shepherd’s presence is everything to his sheep. \n\nIn the same way, in God’s presence, we need nothing more, nothing but Him. He provides and protects, and His love fills us up to overflowing. When we look to anyone or anything else but Him, we will always be left unsatisfied and wanting. Our Good Shepherd knows exactly what we need—when to get up and when to lie down and rest. He calls us to turn our focus toward Him, to be reminded that His presence is enough. He alone supplies all the guidance, provision, and comfort we will ever need.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 51:1-19\n\nSelf-awareness. It’s a funny thing—you either have it or you don’t. And if you don’t, it usually takes a pretty embarrassing situation to make you aware that you are not self-aware. \n\nFor instance, have you ever been in a crowded room, talking to a group of friends, telling a fantastic story, having the time of your life, when you realize everyone in the room has quieted down because your enthusiastic voice has filled the entire space, distracting everyone from their own personal conversations and— \n\nNo? Just me? Cool. \n\nMy point is this: Self-awareness can be hard to come by. And when it “comes by,” it can be… uncomfortable. \n\nDavid wrote Psalm 51 after being hurled into self-awareness by the prophet Nathan. David had just slept with Bathsheba, gotten her pregnant, and ultimately, had Bathsheba’s husband killed to cover up what he’d done. And somehow, it wasn’t until Nathan confronted him that David was brought to his knees over his sin. Boom. Crippling self-awareness. This is the context for David writing in verse 3, “For I recognize my rebellion; it haunts me day and night.” \n\nAwareness of our sin in the presence of a holy God can be an unbearable weight. How could we ever measure up? It’s impossible!\n\nThat’s why I’m glad David isn’t only writing out of an awareness of himself and his own brokenness. His self-awareness is accompanied by an acute “God-awareness.” He knows the God he’s approaching. He comes before God as a man in the wrong, but with an expectation that this holy God, who eternally exists in unapproachable light and holiness, also removes sin, erases blame, and restores joy to those who love Him. He is a God who unwaveringly desires to have David in good standing with Him.\n\nI don’t know about you, but being confronted with the awareness of my own sin can be an oppressively cruel experience. Not only am I made aware of how far away I am from the holiness of God (and that distance is light years!), I often compound that feeling by hurling insults at myself, heaping on guilt and shame. I stand before myself as judge, jury, and accuser, certain that God could never accept me or approve of me because I’m just not good enough. And I wouldn’t be wrong. I’m not good enough. I never will be. I could never meet up to the standards of the holiness of God on my own. \n\nBut here’s the good news: God knows that. And He’s made a way for those who love Him to have access to Him in order to receive His forgiveness, which He freely extends through Christ. This is the God we serve. \n\nSo when I come before God, humbly aware of my sin, I don’t have to abuse myself, bowing beneath the weight of self-hatred and defeat. I can approach Him boldly and with confidence because, just like David, I have a “God-awareness.” I know the God I come before, and He silences the accusations, dismisses the guilt, and loves me out of my shame. Not only that, but every time I approach Him in humility and expectation, He makes me more like Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 55:1-23\n\nI locked myself in the closet and tried to pray despite my bleary eyes and knocking knees. I simply couldn’t face the day. It was too hard, too painful. There was no resolve to muster, no bootstraps big enough to pull myself up by. When I read Psalm 55, I wonder if, perhaps, the psalmist penned it from a similar place.\n\nThis is one of the things I love most about the Word of God. It is not sanitized, polished up to a high shine, and put on display. The Bible does not stick to feel-good mantras or platitudes that make us all smile and nod. There is grit between the pages because, let’s face it, there is grit in all our lives. \n\nThe psalmist opens this passage begging to be heard. There’s no swagger oozing from the tip of his pen. No pretty, religious language found in these verses. He is desperate. His need to hear from the Lord is visceral. \n\n“Listen to me!”\n“Don’t tune me out.”\n“Do You hear me?”\n“ANSWER ME!”\n\nHis gut-level honesty makes me want to stand up and cheer. \n\nBecause there are days I can’t start my prayers neat and tidy. There are moments when my need is so great, and my heart is so tied up in knots, I can’t get much past the lump in my throat. There are times when, if I’m not sure He’s listening, I don’t know how to find the strength to go on. If I could see myself in these moments, I imagine I might look something like Hannah, crying out to God, so wrought with despair that I look drunk or crazy (1 Samuel 1:9-18). \n\nBut God heard the cry of Hannah. He heard the psalmist’s plea. And when we are restless, in anguish, afraid and trembling and horrified, or fighting the urge to take flight (Psalm 55:2,4-6), He hears us too. It seems desperation is a prayer language of its own.\n\nIt was a medical crisis that sent me to the closet that day. It was betrayal by a dear friend that sent the psalmist reeling here, to writing this psalm. Whether it’s the horror of what you see on the news, or the pain of a personal crisis, cry out! The Lord is listening. He doesn’t need us to get the words right, or ask us to wait until we calm down to come before the throne. We can bring Him our snotty noses and ugly cries. He alone can transform them into peace and joy. \n\nIt was in the closet of desperation that I learned this: God is my provider, supernaturally changing my circumstances. And He is also my sustainer, supernaturally carrying me through those circumstances. Both are grace. Perhaps that’s why the psalmist made this declaration, even before his circumstances had shifted: \n\n“Cast your burden on the LORD, and He will sustain you” (v.22). \n\nWhen we hurl our burdens at Christ’s throne, without attempting to wrap them up in pretty bows, we find He is more than able to carry them. Today, whatever our circumstances, whatever is happening in the world around us, we can bring our desperation as an offering of faith, trusting He will get us through. His will, His love, and His justice will prevail.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer for Guidance",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 143:1-12\n\nA few years ago my husband and I were in the middle of an agonizing time of decision-making. He was unemployed, we had a mortgage to pay, we were in the midst of a difficult season where we felt alone as a brand new married couple in a new city, new church, and new job for me. On top of all that, there were some peripheral difficulties clouding our judgment. It was one of those times in life where I felt completely alone and as though any decision we might make would have catastrophic results. Our circumstances weren’t even at their worst yet, but even at that point, we felt paralyzed in the midst of indecision. No direction seemed right or good or sufficient or joyful or enough for anyone else, let alone us. \n\nIt was in the midst of this indecision that one of us read these words from pastor and author Scotty Smith: \n\nGrant us peace as we make important decisions. Some of us are facing career changes, church choices, economic challenges, and health issues. Free us from the foolish notion that there is only one right choice to make. Actually, there is only one right God to trust, and that is you. Lead us, as we lean on you, Father.\n\nThis quote nudged something in us both, and it is the same nudging I feel when I read Psalm 143:8:\n\nLet me hear in the morning of your steadfast love,\nfor in you I trust.\nMake me know the way I should go,\nfor to you I lift up my soul.\n\nSo often we are duped into believing there is only one right decision in front of us. When the way seems cloudy, as it often does, we can find ourselves paralyzed with the fear that we’ll make the wrong decision. But this psalm of David shows us the way. It is a compass for directional purposes: Let me hear your steadfast love. In you I trust. To you I lift up my soul. \n\nWhere do I look when I don’t know where to look? To Him. To His love, His trustworthiness, His help. It is the only place my soul will find rest, the only trustworthy place, and the only love that will not let me go. \n\nWhat decisions are you facing today? What needs to be done or said or moved or broken or taken up? What opinions or thoughts or fears or refrains are you replaying over and over again in your mind? What closed doors or open doors do you see? Now, lift up your eyes, lift up your soul, and see your Maker, your God, your friend, your Savior. If He is your truest north, and serving Him, being loved by Him, and obeying Him is your greatest good, then take a step. Then another. And another. We may never know the direction life is taking us, but we can know the God who keeps us and guides us on the way He is leading us.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer for Help in Trouble",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 142:1-7\n\nWe are not a people fond of showcasing our flaws and failures. So much of our society is meant to elevate our best selves. But no matter how long we drink from the fountain of “you have what it takes” ideology, our frailty remains a bitter pill that cannot be swallowed. \n\nThen we open our Bibles and see an entirely different approach. Prayer is not the place for pep talks or public relations. Unlike social media posts, the purpose of prayer is not to put ourselves in the best light and convince God we are good so that He will respond. Rather, prayer is the place where we admit we are weak and needy, an invitation to confess we are utterly lost in the face of trouble without the sovereign hand of God. \n\nDavid didn’t write Psalm 142 from his palace, surrounded by adoring fans. This isn’t a psalm penned after a military victory or personal triumph. This psalm is a prayer, written from a cave, a crude place of refuge, by a man on the run. \n\nIt’s not clear if these words were penned from the cave of Adullam or En-gedi, two places we find David hiding as he fled from the paranoia of King Saul (1 Samuel 22, 1 Samuel 24). In both circumstances his leader and mentor had vowed to kill him and had the resources and resolve to carry it out. David was a sitting duck who knew he could not defend himself. His enemies were armed and dangerous and David had nothing but desperation. Remarkably, he didn’t try to spin the story. When trouble surrounded him and pressed his back up against the cave wall, David declared his frailty to the Lord: \n\nListen to my cry,\nfor I am very weak.\nRescue me from those who pursue me,\nfor they are too strong for me. —Psalm 142:6\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons why God described David as “a man after my heart” was David’s willingness to own up to his desperation for God’s help (Acts 13:22). I read through God’s Word and cannot help but see a pattern: God is near in our trouble. \n\nWhen faced with a battle he was too weak to win, Jehoshaphat declared, “We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you” and God secured the victory (2 Chronicles 20:12). \n\nDaniel was powerless to shut the lions’ mouths, so he “implored God” to do it for him. God did (Daniel 6:11). \n\nPaul begged the Lord to take away his weakness. In response the Spirit reminded him, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9).  \n\nWeakness is power because in our weakness, we are made strong by God. In the age of spin, I need to be reminded that even weak faith is productive, even feeble prayers are answered (Matthew 17:20). Prayer is an invitation to come as we really are and hear from the God who loves us anyway. \n\nWe each have our own enemies to face and battles we cannot win. Sure, we could try to puff ourselves up with false bravado, but the illusion of our strength is easily exposed. There is an alternative to sinking into despair and defeat. When this world brings trouble to our doorstep, we can look to the Lord for comfort and wait with open hands to receive His strength.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 146:1-10\n\nEverything I need to know about earthly adoration, I learned from my middle school musical theater class. First, we learned through experience. What else is a brace-faced preteen supposed to feel upon receiving a standing ovation for her impeccably off-key version of Oliver! The Musical’s “Food Glorious Food”? For all I knew, applause and attention meant the same thing as adoration.\n\nThen, we learned from the music. One of the delightfully cheesy and romantic tunes that stands out the most is Aretha Franklin’s “I Say A Little Prayer,” which is also included on the soundtrack for the film My Best Friend’s Wedding, starring a young Julia Roberts. Perhaps you remember the chorus:\n\nForever, forever, you’ll stay in my heart\nAnd I will love you\nForever and ever, we never will part\nOh, how I’ll love you\nTogether, together, that’s how it must be\nTo live without you\nWould only be a heartbreak for me.\n\nThese were lyrics that made even prepubescent girls swoon. During rehearsals, we’d stand squished on the risers, divided into altos and sopranos, as our choral director clapped the rhythms and contorted his face into exaggerated expressions, commanding us to annunciate! “FOR-EV-ER, FOR-EV-ER,” he would chant.\n\nIt’s no coincidence that this is what we long for. We want the affection we receive to be sure, and the praise we give to remain warranted—not just one-time applause. Commitment and adoration go hand in hand, and with God, we get both.\n\nHere is where the romantic comedy cliches and the middle school dramatics stop. Adoration is not intended to be a general concept that God calls for early on and then forgets about. Rather, adoration is something we see carried throughout the psalms as a rhythmic refrain to God’s presence and nearness to us. Psalm 146 recalls reasons for adoring God: He frees prisoners, opens the eyes of the blind, raises up the oppressed, loves the righteous, and protects resident aliens. \n\nAdoration is the response we give to our God who is good and faithful in all things. It is the deep abiding love that only comes from the safety of a covenant made by a promise-keeping God who loves His children. It is His reason for choosing us, and our reason for returning to Him. He wants to adore us as His own for eternity, and because of that, we get to return and enjoy His love forever.\n\nGod remains faithful forever. (FOR-EV-ER!) His kingdom and promises and love for us will stand firm into eternity. May we learn to love and adore Him in return.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer for the Church",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 84:1-12\n\nI learned how to drive on the interstate that we took to get to church every Sunday. My parents forced me to drive on that busy road because they knew I would have to drive it many, many times over the next few years while I lived in Birmingham. My family was in that building every time the doors were open. Sunday school, Sunday morning worship, Sunday evening worship, Wednesday evening Bible class—you name it, we were there sitting on the front row. \n\nWhile I was growing up, church always felt a little bit like something I had to check off a to-do list. I never spent the night at friends’ houses on Saturday night because I had to go to church in the morning. I would always rush home from sports practices on Wednesdays so I could make it to youth group on time. I loved church, yes, but it never felt like the kind of church the psalmist is describing in Psalm 84.\n\nWhen I was in college, I spent a semester in Santiago, Chile, and for three months, I didn’t go to church, not really. I didn’t speak much Spanish at the time, and so when I did attend church there, I spent more time and energy trying to translate the sermon in my head than just worshiping. While I was in Chile, church began to take on a completely different meaning than it did when I was a child.\n\nOver the course of a few months, the idea of “church” shifted to “Church.” The distinction of the capital “C” allowed me to view the Church as a larger being, as something other than just the place I went to worship. The Church is so much more than the small box in which I’d stowed my idea of our local church. It is family, community, a safe place to worship and experience the presence of our God.\n\nEven a sparrow finds a home,\nand a swallow, a nest for herself\nwhere she places her young—\nnear your altars, LORD of Armies,\nmy King and my God.\nHow happy are those who reside in your house,\nwho praise you continually.    Selah. \n—Psalm 84:3-4\n\n Let us use Psalm 84 as a means of pleading with God for what we want His Kingdom to look like here, now. May we be a people and a Church that reside in the house of our Lord, a people who praise Him continually. May we allow the Church to be a safe place for outsiders, a home for those who are lost, and a family for the broken. And may we pray for the Church be a place that bridges the gap between heaven and earth, where we meet with our God and enjoy His presence together, as a community.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 2:1-12\n\nI like to be the first one awake at my house. However, I don’t like to set an alarm clock because of my dedication to the mysterious idea of sleep cycles. So instead, I play a pillow-cushioned game of Russian roulette every morning. When my body needs more sleep, I let the old girl sleep. But sometimes it all works out so that I have this gorgeous window of time—typing, planning, organizing—setting the stage for the day ahead before anyone else is awake.\n\nOne morning I was up at 5 a.m., feeling strong. I filled my arms full of things I wanted to carry into the kitchen: cups from last night, my phone, a clipboard, my little portable speaker, and a few rolls of washi tape ringed around my thumb. Juggling all of this in the dark, I preemptively nudged my phone to start playing some quiet piano music, because it usually takes a while to load. \n\nBut here are a couple things I didn’t know: First, my phone was already linked to the portable speaker. And second, everything was set at full volume. (Oh, and one thing you didn’t know: there were nine other people, too, sleeping nearby.) So in the pre-dawn light, on my way to some quiet, productive time in the kitchen, I found myself in the middle of the house, my arms uncomfortably full, clutching a speaker that was inexplicably bellowing the climax from Handel’s Messiah: “WOR-THY IS THE LAMB, THAT WAS SLAIN!”\n\nI circled around like a toy car, fumbling to turn the music off in the dark, and somehow succeeded in making the volume louder still—probably because my eyes were mostly squinted shut from laughing. And since you can’t shush a speaker, it took me a while to get quiet again.\n\nI think we sometimes want to keep Jesus in a little quiet box too. The title of today’s reading is “A Prayer Celebrating the Gift of Jesus,” and honestly, I’d expected to be writing about a sweet Christmas baby Jesus as our joy to the world. But this psalm is about the almighty dominion of Christ. He did come as a baby, yes, but He is also the omnipotent King of kings.\n\nThe psalmist calls us to “serve the Lord with reverential awe, and rejoice with trembling” (Psalm 2:11). He is a God we cannot control and cannot fully comprehend. Our proper response is to worship Him. It’s easier to think of Jesus as our pocket-sized best friend, but we need to remember that He rules and reigns the cosmos. He is a paradox, making His love for us all the more potent. We must pay Him homage, for He is our King, and all who take refuge in Him are happy.\n\nThis paradox is a beautiful and central tenet of our faith: “kiss the Son, lest He be angry” (v.12). Our God comes low to love mankind, but He remains just and unchanging, righteous and holy. We are sloppy and funny and sneaky. His love for His wishy-washy creation is so wonderful, but it doesn’t change who He is; who He has always been—the King of all creation. So we worship at the feet of this mystery we cannot control. And we celebrate the gift of Jesus, both as a baby and as King.\n\n",

Her family was so poor that when baby Fanny got a simple eye infection at six weeks old, they were unable to help her, resulting in the loss of her vision before she was even weaned. Still, she grew to be one of the most prolific hymn writers in America. Over the course of her 94 years, Fanny Crosby wrote well over 8,000 gospel songs. Given that she used more than 200 pen names, there may well be many more.\n\nFanny often composed lyrics to music written by friends. She just had a knack for it. But Fanny had standards, and wouldn’t write lyrics to just any old tune. Sometimes musicians would bring music from a saloon song and propose that she sanctify the lyrics. At this proposition, Fanny crossed her dignified ankles and declared, “Oh my, no.” She maintained that the Church must never sing its songs to the melodies of the world.\n\nOne of her dearest musician friends was Phoebe Knapp. And as poor as Fanny was, Phoebe was rich. She was born into the Brooklyn elite, and enjoyed the advantages of great wealth. These two very different women attended the same church and struck up a dear friendship. You could say Fanny’s favorite frolic was the philharmonics at Phoebe’s fancy flat. (But be careful.)\n\nOne afternoon, Phoebe sat at the piano and played a song of her own devising while Fanny listened quietly. As the story goes, when the music ended, Fanny clapped her hands and declared, “Why, that says ‘Blessed Assurance!'” And so the hymn was born.\n\nOur assurance in Christ is indeed blessed. He promises us simply and truly that “Anyone who believes has eternal life” (John 6:47).\n\nBlessed Assurance by Fanny Crosby\n\nBlessed assurance; Jesus is mine!\nOh, what a foretaste of glory divine!\nHeir of salvation, purchase of God,\nborn of His Spirit, washed in his blood.\n\nThis is my story, this is my song,\npraising my Savior all the day long;\nthis is my story, this is my song,\npraising my Savior all the day long.\n\nPerfect submission, perfect delight,\nvisions of rapture now burst on my sight;\nangels descending bring from above\nechoes of mercy, whispers of love. \n\nPerfect submission, all is at rest,\nI in my Savior am happy and blest;\nwatching and waiting, looking above,\nfilled with His goodness, lost in His love.\n\n               ",

It lays out the effects of believing in the sacrifice of Jesus, hiding those truths in the hearts of those who sing them. And a great many have. This hymn by Lewis Edgar Jones has appeared in hundreds of hymnals down through the years and is still widely known and sung today.\n\nLewis Jones graduated from the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, then went to work for the Young Men’s Christian Association, better known as the YMCA. Jones wore many hats in his role with the YMCA, including organizing camps for those young men. Hymn writing was something he considered more of a side project. Often writing under pseudonyms, Jones wrote not to gain fame but to serve his campers.\n\nIt was during a camp meeting in Mountain Lake Park, Maryland, that Jones wrote both the lyrics and melody for “There Is Power in the Blood.” The simple song served a simple purpose: to remind the singer that he is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ alone—not by anything he himself does. 5\n\nSince that camp meeting, countless believers, young and old, have sung the song around campfires everywhere, proclaiming the ways the blood of Christ rescues sinners: \n\nIt frees us from the burden of sin and secures our victory over it. \n\nIt works against our pride even as it cleanses us of guilt. \n\nIt purifies us and calls us to praise Jesus for His generous grace.\n\nUsing repetition, rhyme, and imagery, Jones’s song clarifies what it means to trust in Christ. Listen as the refrain unpacks the glorious truth: There’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nThere Is Power in the Blood by Lewis Edgar Jones\n\nWould you be free from the burden of sin?\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\nWould you o’er evil a victory win?\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nThere is power, power, wonder-working power\nIn the blood of the Lamb.\nThere is power, power, wonder-working power\nIn the precious blood of the Lamb.\n\nWould you be free from your passion and pride?\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\nCome for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide;\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood. \n\nWould you be whiter, much whiter than snow?\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\nSin stains are lost in its life-giving flow;\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nWould you do service for Jesus your King?\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\nWould you live daily His praises to sing?\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\n           ",

He stayed on there as a professor, eventually becoming chair of his department and then president of a nearby university. Once the man put himself on a path, he didn’t budge.\n\nTeaching paid the bills, but John’s joyful pursuit was discovering and preserving African American spiritual music. He led the Fisk Jubilee Singers for six years, touring at home and abroad. The Nashville boy got to see the world and share the art of the African American spiritual along the way. In a time when few black men were afforded the luxury of travel, John Jr. performed for Queen Victoria.\n\nIt took three generations of Works men over 70 years of field research, transcription, and publishing to put together a wide collection of African American spirituals which otherwise could have been lost to history. It was in this collection that John Jr. became the first to publish the hymn “Go Tell It on the Mountain.” \n\nThis hymn, like other spirituals of the era, had previously been communicated through singing only. Putting the tune and lyrics down on paper was a way John could give voice to the unknown slave who had composed the song many years before—who, despite his earthly enslavement, sang out with victorious hope. \n\n“Go Tell It on the Mountain” celebrates the good news of the God who makes Himself known to His people, right where they are.\n\nGo Tell It on the Mountain adapted by John W.

One of the many was the hymn-writing career of Johnson Oatman, Jr. \n\nHe wrote 5,000 hymns during his lifetime, a handful widely regarded as standards: “Higher Ground,” “No, Not One!,” and “Count Your Many Blessings.” That final example was first published in a songbook for young people. It is considered to be Oatman’s opus. One critic said: “Like a beam of sunlight it has brightened up the dark places of the earth.”\n\nThe Sunday nights of my childhood were spent in church, hemmed in among the waistlines of good Baptists. The feeling was laid back, no strict order of service like the morning. Often the song leader would loosen his tie and ask us for our favorite hymns. We Baptists didn’t bet, but some voice crying out “Count Your Many Blessings” was a sure thing, every time.\n\nOn those easy-like-Sunday evenings, the last half of that hymn’s chorus held a temptation too great for a song leader to resist: congregational participation. He’d always surrender. He would gradually slow us during that high E-flat “Count your blessings,” followed by the descending “name them one by one.” Then he’d bring us up full stop, still as sheep. He’d grin and say, “Now I know one of you has a blessing to count.” A grateful voice would rise, followed by another, and then another. And we would name them, always surprised at what the Lord had done, every time.\n\nCount Your Blessings by Johnson Oatman, Jr.\n\nWhen upon life’s billows you are tempest tossed,\nWhen you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,\nCount your many blessings, name them one by one,\nAnd it will surprise you what the Lord hath done. \n\nCount your blessings, name them one by one;\nCount your blessings, see what God hath done;\nCount your blessings, name them one by one;\nCount your many blessings, see what God hath done.\n\nAre you ever burdened with a load of care?\nDoes the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?\nCount your many blessings, ev’ry doubt will fly,\nAnd you will be singing as the days go by. \n\nWhen you look at others with their lands and gold,\nThink that Christ has promised you His wealth untold;\nCount your many blessings, money cannot buy\nYour reward in heaven, nor your home on high.\n\nSo, amid the conflict, whether great or small,\nDo not be discouraged, God is over all;\nCount your many blessings, angels will attend,\nHelp and comfort give you to your journey’s end.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Isaiah 1:18, Mark 10:45, 2 Corinthians 12:1-10, Ephesians 1:13-14, 1 Peter 1:18-21, Revelation 5:11-14\n\nWhenever I imagine the writing of a hymn, I picture a Victorian-era man with mutton chops and mussed up hair, scribbling by the flickering light of a lantern. His fingers are smudged with ink as he prays and pens and receives inspiration. A piano sits nearby, where he taps out a tune to adorn his words. It’s a very holy, solitary affair.\n\nPerhaps other hymns were written this way, but “Jesus Paid It All” was not. Of the hymn’s origin, one author put it this way: “An obscure woman scribbles a poem on the flyleaf of her hymnal, an amateur church musician unknowingly creates a matching tune, an unknown pastor provides encouragement, and another hymn is born.”\n\nWritten in 1865, this hymn about the total sufficiency of Christ’s atoning work on the cross was not a solitary affair, but a fruit of His church. Partially inspired by William Bradbury’s hymn by the same name, this version was written by Elvina M. Hall, while she sat listening to a sermon from the choir loft of Monument Street Methodist Church in Baltimore, Maryland. She jotted the lyrics on the inside of her hymnal and shared them with her pastor after the service.\n\nNothing might have become of those lyrics had John T. Grape not also attended Hall’s church. \n\nThirty years earlier, Grape served as organist and choir director, during which time he composed a tune titled “All to Christ I Owe.” After hearing the music, the pastor was reportedly “unimpressed,” and set it aside. Thankfully, that same pastor recalled Grape’s tune as he read Hall’s words some three decades later. He believed they would make a great match, and history has proven him right.\n\nThe story of “Jesus Paid It All” is a marvelous exhibit of God assembling various talents over time to orchestrate something beautiful and powerful: a song of our complete redemption.\n\nJesus Paid It All by Elvina M. Hall\n\nI hear the Savior say,\n“Thy strength indeed is small,\nChild of weakness, watch and pray,\nFind in Me thine all in all.”\n\nJesus paid it all,\n All to Him I owe;\nSin had left a crimson stain,\nHe washed it white as snow.\n\nLord, now indeed I find\nThy pow’r and Thine alone,\nCan change the leper’s spots\nAnd melt the heart of stone. \n\nFor nothing good have I\nWhereby Thy grace to claim;\nI’ll wash my garments white\nIn the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb. \n\nAnd when, before the throne,\nI stand in Him complete,\n“Jesus died my soul to save,”\nMy lips shall still repeat.\n\n",

One such teen was Bessie, a 14-year-old daughter of an alcoholic. Black met her in an alley in town, invited her to church, and she accepted. Bessie attended regularly until one day, as Black called roll, she did not respond.\n\nThe gospel teacher’s heart was moved by her absence. He said to the class, “When my own name is called up yonder, may I be there to respond.”\n\nAfter Sunday school, James Black went to Bessie’s home to find her laid up with pneumonia, on the verge of death. Again his heart was pierced. He went home and, in a single sitting, wrote “When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder.” A few days later he led the congregation in singing the hymn at Bessie’s funeral.\n\nMore than a century later, Black’s song remains a reminder of hope in the face of mortality and suffering—a proclamation of the certainty of Christ’s coming. It isn’t a declaration of judgment, or some hellfire and brimstone dirge. The lyrics lift the soul and call listeners to Jesus.\n\nBlack calls believers to revel in, reflect publicly, and proclaim the love of Jesus—“of all His wondrous love and care”—as he did for Bessie and so many like her. His hymn points to the promise of eternal hope and joy for those in Jesus when God calls them home.\n\nWhen the Roll Is Called Up Yonder by James Black\n\nWhen the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more,\nand the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;\nwhen the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore,\nand the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.\n\nWhen the roll is called up yonder,\nwhen the roll is called up yonder,\nwhen the roll is called up yonder,\nwhen the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.\n\nOn that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise,\nand the glory of His resurrection share;\nwhen His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies,\nand the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there. \n\nLet us labor for the Master from the dawn till setting sun;\nlet us talk of all His wondrous love and care;\n\nthen when all of life is over, and our work on earth is done,\nand the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.\n\n",

Austin Miles was a pharmacist by trade, but the darkroom was home to his truer loves: photography and Bible-reading. He’d sit and read Scripture while waiting for film to develop, his well-worn Bible illuminated by the room’s familiar glow. \n\nOn such a day in March 1912, Miles began to process his photos, then opened his Bible to John chapter 20 as he waited. He’d read the passage before; it was one of his favorites. But this time, the scene seemed to come alive. He found himself imagining he was face to face with Jesus as He spoke to Mary near the empty garden tomb.\n\nOf the experience Miles wrote, “I awakened in full light, gripping the Bible, with muscles tense and nerves vibrating. Under the inspiration of this vision, I wrote as quickly as the words could be formed the poem exactly as it appeared. That same evening I wrote the music.”\n\nIn addition to his photos, Miles had developed a reputation as a music director at conventions, churches, camp meetings, and the like. Not long before that March inspiration, a music publisher named Adam Geibel had asked Miles to compose a specific type of hymn—one that was sympathetic and tender, “one that would bring hope to the hopeless, rest for the weary, and downy pillows to dying beds.”14 With the Holy Spirit’s help, a “downy pillow” for the soul is just what he delivered. \n\nWe all come to the garden alone, but our suffering Savior meets us there. He tells us what is true: we are His own.\n\nIn the Garden by C. Austin Miles\n\nI come to the garden alone,\nWhile the dew is still on the roses;\nAnd the voice I hear, falling on my ear,\nThe Son of God discloses.\n\nAnd He walks with me, and He talks with me,\nAnd He tells me I am His own,\nAnd the joy we share as we tarry there,\nNone other has ever known.\n\nHe speaks, and the sound of His voice\nIs so sweet the birds hush their singing;\nAnd the melody that He gave to me\nWithin my heart is ringing. \n\nI’d stay in the garden with Him\nTho’ the night around me be falling;\nBut He bids me go; thro’ the voice of woe,\nHis voice to me is calling. \n\n",

One of the more popular of these traveling teachers was A.J. Showalter. Showalter published over 130 music books, his sales exceeding more than two million copies. He traveled throughout the South to various churches, spending roughly a month with each of them, teaching these revival songs. \n\nOn one of these trips, while in the small town of Hartselle, Alabama, A.J. Showalter returned to his room to find two pieces of mail. Each was from a former student, and each contained a tragic story. Both students had lost their wives on the same day and were now widowers. \n\nEager to offer them solace, Showalter searched the scriptures till he found Deuteronomy 33:27, which read, “The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.” And so he began to write the memorable chorus,\n\nLeaning, leaning, safe and secure from all alarm\n\nLeaning, leaning, leaning on the everlasting arms.\n\nShowalter sent the devastated men these words of comfort even as he was still struggling to compose the verses. He shared what he’d written with a friend, Elisha Hoffman, who then provided the verses. With those verses in place, Showalter wrote the music of the hymn we know today.\n\nIt’s ironic that this hymn, born of great tragedy, is couched in an upbeat tune that makes it so easy to remember. But in times of great sorrow, there can be no better truth to recall than this: we can lean, safe and secure, on the everlasting arms of our Lord.\n\nLeaning on the Everlasting Arms by E. A. Hoffman\n\nWhat a fellowship, what a joy divine,\nleaning on the everlasting arms;\nwhat a blessedness, what a peace is mine,\nleaning on the everlasting arms.\n\nLeaning, leaning,\nsafe and secure from all alarms;\nleaning, leaning,\nleaning on the everlasting arms.\n\nO how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,\nleaning on the everlasting arms;\nO how bright the path grows from day to day,\nleaning on the everlasting arms. \n\nWhat have I to dread, what have I to fear,\nleaning on the everlasting arms?\nI have blessed peace with my Lord so near,\nleaning on the everlasting arms.\n\n",

To make matters worse, he was also kind, an expert swimmer, captain of the baseball team, and student orchestra leader. Babcock’s tall, muscled figure was the only thing about him that wasn’t well-rounded. \n\nAfter graduating from Syracuse University, he attended Auburn Theological Seminary and eventually became the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Lockport, New York. In between his daily pastoral duties, Babcock itched to get out of the church office and explore the outdoors surrounding it. \n\nHis favorite place to walk was a large hill two miles away that overlooked Lake Ontario. Grabbing his coat and running out the door, Babcock would tell his secretary, “I’m going to see my Father’s world.” He’d later write a sixteen-stanza poem, each verse beginning with that very same sentiment: “This is my Father’s world.”\n\nSadly, Maltbie Babcock died at age 42 from a bacteria he contracted on a ship en route to the Holy Land. Following his death, his wife compiled his writings into a book called Thoughts for Everyday Living, published in 1901. Fourteen years later, in 1915, the tune for this poem-turned-hymn was arranged from an old English melody by one of Babcock’s close friends, accomplished musician F.L. Sheppard.\n\nStill a favorite today, “This Is My Father’s World” reminds us not only of the beauty of creation, but of the way it tethers us to the more enduring beauty of the gospel and to the goodness of our Father.\n\nThis Is My Father’s World by Maltbie D. Babcock\n\nThis is my Father’s world,\nAnd to my listening ears\nAll nature sings, and round me rings\nThe music of the spheres.\n\nThis is my Father’s world:\nI rest me in the thought\nOf rocks and trees, of skies and seas—\nHis hand the wonders wrought.\n\nThis is my Father’s world:\nThe birds their carols raise,\nThe morning light, the lily white,\nDeclare their Maker’s praise.\n\nThis is my Father’s world:\nHe shines in all that’s fair;\nIn the rustling grass I hear Him pass,\nHe speaks to me everywhere.\n\nThis is my Father’s world:\nO let me ne’er forget\nThat though the wrong seems oft so strong,\nGod is the Ruler yet.\n\nThis is my Father’s world:\nWhy should my heart be sad?\nThe Lord is King: let the heavens ring!\nGod reigns; let earth be glad!\n\n",

He eventually pursued his artistic dreams at the collegiate level, and after graduation moved to Pennsylvania, where he immediately took up a position as an art teacher. \n\nAs a young adult he was able to venture out on a tour of some of Europe’s finest galleries, taking in great masterpieces and refining his own painterly skills. Some said he had the makings of a truly exceptional artist, poised to take his place among the greats.\n\nJudson had been a devout believer since his youth, and as an adult, he became active in the music ministry at his church. Though he’d always loved being an artist, the tug of ministry life proved a real struggle for him. God had all along been wooing him to full-time ministry, and it seemed that his hope of a life of artistic influence would have to go. After years of struggle, Judson knelt in prayer, saying, “I surrender all to Thee.”19 Years later, he penned the hymn inspired by this pivotal moment of calling. \n\nFrom this patient life of submission, God brought forth much fruit—not only through the impact of this famous American hymn, but also through Judson’s ongoing service at Florida Bible Institute, where a young Billy Graham was inspired by Judson’s ministry. \n\nAs in Judson’s life, the gentle moving of God’s Spirit often works by ordinary means to affect in us extraordinary surrender. May our hearts, quickened by His Spirit, be conformed to His likeness, molded by His love, and enlivened by His power, that we may rest on nothing of our own, but surrender all to Him.\n\nI Surrender All by Judson W. Van DeVenter\n\nAll to Jesus I surrender,\nAll to Him I freely give;\nI will ever love and trust Him,\nIn His presence daily live.\n\nI surrender all, I surrender all;\nAll to Thee, my blessed Savior,\nI surrender all.\n\nAll to Jesus I surrender,\nMake my, Savior, wholly Thine;\nLet me feel Thy Holy Spirit,\nTruly know that Thou art mine.\n\nAll to Jesus I surrender,\nLord, I give myself to Thee;\nFill me with Thy love and power,\nLet Thy blessing fall on me. \n\n",

It was like a dream, and she longs for the Lord to do it again.\n\nWe may go out weeping today, sowing our seeds in tears, but there is a harvest of joy we shall reap for all eternity. For now, we live in the tension.\n\nReflect\n\n1. Name a time in your life when you were filled with the joy described in Psalm 126:2. What made your season of joy so happy?\n\n2. Name a time in your life when you were filled with the sorrow described in Psalm 126:5-6. What made that season so hard? Do you mask pain? If so, how and why?\n\n3.

We are not passive in this process. This song calls us to work diligently, to love self-sacrificially, and to train the children in our lives to know and walk with God.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Kings 18:20-40; Psalm 65:5-8; Exodus 12:40-42,51; Exodus 14:21-31; Exodus 19:16-25; Exodus 7:3-5\n\nSeeing is not believing. \n\nI ask for miracles all the time. I implore God for snow days, chase after lost causes, and jockey for acclaim. I ask God to change people. I ask Him to change me. And most of all, I ask Him to heal.\n\nThe possibility of miracles is such lush fruit to my imagination. It means that anything is possible. God could pop down, give a little nudge, and fix any problem. And when He doesn’t, it’s confusing. If He could do a miracle, why doesn’t He do one for me?\n\nIn preparing for this study, I noticed that Jesus doesn’t do miracles on command. He isn’t anybody’s trick pony. In fact, He blesses those “who do not see, and yet believe” (John 20:29), and He rebukes a generation that “seeks for a sign” (Matthew 12:39). And, man, I do love a good sign. \n\nIt seems if Jesus were just willing to do a bit of skywriting, all would believe and the world would be saved. It’s so much easier to ask for a sign instead of looking to the person of Christ, to hunt after what He can do for us instead of who He is. His miracles aren’t His message, but rather a testament to who He is. And even those who witnessed His miracles did not necessarily believe.\n\nThis study focuses on miracles performed by Jesus. But for a big picture, let’s step back and look at all kinds of miracles in the Bible. When reading any scripture, I ask myself, “What is God doing in this passage?” These passages on miracles make it easy to answer that question and learn more about the character of God in the process. \n\n\u2022 He is supreme and omnipresent: God shows His unearthly power when He scorches the dripping-wet sacrifices for Elijah at Mt. Carmel (1 Kings 18). \n\u2022 He is sovereign and omnipotent: He is the Master of nature and quiets the storms (Matthew 8:23-27). \n\u2022 He is merciful and good: He is the source of our salvation (John 3:16; Hebrews 5:7-10). \n\u2022 He is holy and omniscient: He is the thundering presence on Mount Sinai (Exodus 19). \n\nMiracles are one of the ways God expresses His “otherness” to us. They reveal Him in His power, and show us He is not like us. The rules of nature that bind us do not bind Him. The laws of a created world are amendable by the One who created it.\n\nAs we read through this study, think about what Jesus’ miracles tell us about His character. Remember that these are nothing less than acts of God performed by Immanuel, “God with us.” Although signs and wonders may not accompany every moment of our lives, the One who makes them possible does.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Why Did Jesus Perform Miracles?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 11:2-5, Isaiah 61:1-3, John 2:11, Matthew 12:28-42\n\nMost of us have been there. It’s not just painful, but confusingly painful. \n\nDidn’t God hear?\nDoesn’t He love me?\nDid I not have enough faith?\nWhy wasn’t it a yes?\n\nThese are the questions we ask when the miracle doesn’t come.\n\nPerhaps it was the cancer that wasn’t cured, the chronic illness that never healed, the marriage that couldn’t be saved, or the money that didn’t come through. In the absence of a miracle, these stories about Jesus can be tough to swallow. They can even feel cruel. Why are they here, if not to tease us?\n\nGod knows we feel this tension, which is perhaps why He included Matthew 11:2-5 in His perfect Word. Here, John the Baptist asks Jesus if He is, in fact, the “one who is to come”—the Messiah. Jesus answers with a clear allusion to Isaiah 61: “Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up” (Matthew 11:4-5). He’s essentially saying, “Yes. All the things that were foretold, I am fulfilling them.”\n\nJesus’ answer to John tells us a lot about the purpose of His miracles: They are a sign of the prophecies fulfilled, a sign that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah. They are a sign of His authority, His power, and His glory. And they are a sign of God’s love for us, a sign that we can trust Him. \n\nBut here’s what we shouldn’t miss about Jesus’ answer, because John certainly wouldn’t have. Isaiah 61 also says this of the coming Messiah: He will “proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound” (v.1). It’s a message of hope for prisoners, which is exactly what John was; John received Jesus’ message while sitting in a prison cell. And yet, John the Baptist was never set free. Three chapters later, he’s beheaded. Scripture tells us that when Jesus got word of John the Baptist’s death, “he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself” (Matthew 14:13). \n\nOur God is not indifferent to our pain.\n\nMatthew 11:2-5 contains all the power and the glory and the complexity and confusion of Jesus’ miracles. It attests to Jesus’ divine identity, but it also attests to the reality that miracles don’t always come. In this tension, we learn more about what Jesus’ miracles mean.\n\nJesus’ miracles weren’t only about Him, but about the Kingdom to come. Tucked into every miracle we can almost hear God whisper, “This is what the Kingdom is like. It’s complete healing, total wholeness, freedom, awe, and joy.” Miracles provide a foretaste of this in-breaking Kingdom, but they were never meant to replace it. \n\nWe’ll never have the perfect peace and restoration we desire this side of eternity, but miracles point to the place where we will.\n\nWhenever we read stories of miracles, and grapple with their surpassing mystery, we can do so knowing our God is not casual or removed from our pain. Jesus’ very presence on earth reminds us that He entered into it, experiencing the pain along with us. Jesus joined us in waiting for the Kingdom, longing for the day when the need for miracles will be no more. \n\n",

Although I’d never before considered myself a picky eater, a few weeks of traveling in a foreign country taught me that these exotic dishes were a real game-changer. \n\nOne night, I’d decided to play it safe by ordering the catch of the day. What the menu didn’t specify, however, was that not much had been done since the fish had been caught that day, leaving me with a scaly, slippery dish and two beady eyes staring mockingly back at me. \n\nThe next night, I knew better. Using my handy translator’s dictionary, I learned the word for “eyes,” and walked into the restaurant with a newfound resilience. \n\n“Ojos?” I asked with confidence, ordering the chicken this time. \n\n“No, no,” the waiter responded, chuckling. \n\nThe dish arrived just as I’d ordered it—no eyes this time, but… there were feathers. Like I was just supposed to put them in my hat and carry on. \n\nI’m the queen of asking the wrong questions. \n\nI’ve always had lots of questions about miracles. And if I’m being completely transparent, most of the time it hurts to ask them. Because while learning about Jesus’ healing power and His heart for His people, my questions inevitably turn to, Will He do this for me? or Why didn’t He do this for me? \n\nHope does not come from belief in power; it comes from trust in a Person. When we don’t understand what Jesus is doing, we must seek to know Him more. \n\nAs C.S. Lewis said, “Christianity does not involve the belief that all things were made for man.” So our first question needs to change from “What does this say about me?” to “What does this teach me about Jesus?” Or, as Mark 4 says, miracles should cause us to ask, “Who then is this? Even the wind and the sea obey Him!” (v.41). \n\nBefore we get any further into this miracle-studying business, let that be our default question: Who then is this Jesus? \n\nHe is the victorious Lord of all (Colossians 1:15).\nHe is Lord over creation (Mark 4:39).\nHe is the One who overcomes evil (Luke 11:18-23).\nHe is the Suffering Servant who bears our infirmities (Matthew 8:17).\n\nMiracles are breadcrumbs that lead us to the One who answers our need. They themselves are not the prize or the point, because He is already actively both. Miracles teach us that Jesus is God’s glory purposed for redemption. He came to show us His power to heal, but more importantly, to show us we’ve already been healed in Him.\n\nIf and (inevitably) when I begin to ask the wrong questions, may I look to the fullness of Christ and find that my need for Him is a privilege. May I praise Him for His miracles, but not miss the biggest miracle of all: Jesus Himself. \n\n“For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him, and through Him to reconcile everything to Himself by making peace through the blood of His cross whether things on earth or things in heaven.” –Colossians 1:19-20\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Miracles of Food and Drink",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 14:14-21, Luke 5:4-11, John 21:1-11, John 2:1-11\n\nFood is an unmistakable theme in the miracles of Jesus. There is no aspect of humanity that Jesus ignored, including our need for food. \n\nJesus ate. He drank. He attended dinner parties—lots of them. The beginning of His earthly ministry included the miracle of turning water into wine at a wedding reception (John 2:1-11). And before He ascended back into heaven, He cooked His disciples breakfast with fish He’d miraculously jammed into their nets (John 21:1-14). In today’s reading, we see that He also supernaturally fed tens of thousands of followers. \n\nThis helps me to see the practical side of Jesus more clearly. Sure, His supernatural nature is awesome, and we’re keenly aware of our need to see His hand in the “big stuff.” But we tend to whizz right past the fact that He sees and responds to both our extraordinary and our ordinary needs. \n\nIn Matthew 14, we find one of Christ’s most famous miracles, what’s known as the “Feeding of the Five Thousand.” But this was actually a miracle on a much grander scale. Scripture says five thousand men were present “besides women and children” (v.21), meaning there were likely closer to 15,000 people gathered around Jesus—and He fed every single one of them until they were full (v.20). \n\nThese were people shot through with grief and sorrow. John the Baptist, one of their spiritual heroes, had just been brutally beheaded (Matthew 14:1-12). At the news of His dear cousin’s murder, Jesus retreated to a desolate place to mourn, but the grieving crowds followed Him, desperate for hope in the midst of hurt, for light in the darkness.\n\nAs their Maker, Jesus knew the crowd’s deepest needs were spiritual, yet He did not race past their immediate physical needs. In verse 14 we catch a glimpse of a thread that weaves throughout the miracles of Jesus: “When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them.”\n\nCompassion motivated Jesus to feed the crowds. He satisfied their physical hunger so they could see that He alone is capable of satisfying their spiritual hunger. \n\nIn Mark 8:1-10 we see that another crowd tracked Jesus down and remained with Him to hear Him teach for three days—without food. If He sent them home, some would faint on the way (v.3). Again, He responded with compassion, meeting their physical needs so they could digest the spiritual truths He desired to teach them. He gave them bread and fish so that they could “taste and see that the Lord is good” (Psalm 34:8). \n\nPerhaps food is just a tether keeping us close to the truth that we are not our own sustainers. Is it possible that God hard-wired our physical needs into our DNA to teach us of our bigger, constant need for Him? What if every meal were a parable teaching us that Jesus is the Bread of Life (John 6:35), the True Bread from Heaven (John 6:32), the Grain of Wheat (John 12:24), and the Living Water (John 4:10-11).\n\nJesus’ miracles are never about the miracle itself. They’re about Jesus. He doesn’t intervene in our lives primarily for our comfort, but for His glory, that we would turn to Him. Every last one of our needs points to and is met in Him. \n\n",

I confess that the moment he invited us into this journey, I began to doubt that God would actually hear my prayers. I usually like to manage my expectations and qualify my prayers with something like, “If it’s Your will, Lord, then…” But our pastor was calling us to more. He was calling us to faith. Since that encouragement, I’ve sought to ask Jesus to do miracles in my own my life. But I fear my faith is lacking.\n\nI relate to the fear the disciples so often display in the Gospels. They were normal people, after all, just like you and me. Although they walked with Jesus, they still struggled with unbelief (Luke 8:25). And like the disciples, when the storms rage and the winds blow and everything seems unsure in my own life, peace feels far off and unimaginable. \n\nThe unknown can be scary, but Jesus calls us to something greater than our fear. He calls us to faith. The miracles of Jesus remind us that no matter our circumstances, He proves His faithfulness over and over again. He doesn’t just offer peace—He is Peace. He doesn’t exercise His power over nature—He is Power. \n\nJesus’ miracles over land and sea are examples of the power and authority He has over the world He created (John 1:1-3). Scripture tells us that Jesus defied gravity by walking on water (Mark 6:49), and that the winds and the waves obeyed Him with a word (Luke 8:24-27). But despite all they had witnessed throughout their time with Jesus, even the disciples didn’t understand. They lacked faith and their hearts grew hard (Mark 6:52). While Jesus didn’t have to reveal His power in this way, through miracles, He did so out of His mercy for them. \n\nJust as He did with the disciples, Jesus calls us to trust Him in the middle of the storms we face. He asks us, “Where is your faith?” because what’s going on in our doubtful, troubled hearts is important to Him. He gently instructs us to “Have courage!” and reminds us that it’s because of who He is that we don’t have to be afraid (Mark 6:50). The rules of nature don’t apply to Him. The One who spoke creation into existence can also calm it with a word (Mark 4:35-41).\n\nJesus invites us to trust Him, and I long for the faith to do so. His miracles are for us, too, so that we might see and know that He is Lord. The wind may be howling, the waves may be crashing, but our God is faithful in the midst of it all. By His grace, may we have the courage to trust Him in any circumstance. May we have the faith to call out to Him, to take Him at His word, and to believe.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nText: Luke 8:27-39, Matthew 9:32-34, Luke 11:14, Mark 7:24-30, Luke 4:31-37, Matthew 17:14-21\n\nIn the preface to his famous satirical novel, The Screwtape Letters, C.S. Lewis writes this of demons:\n\n“There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them.”\n\nWhen venturing into the territory of demons and demonic possession, it’s tempting either to write them off as ancient misdiagnoses of mental illness, or to become overly fascinated with them, attributing more power to demons than they have. Either mistake is easy to make because many of us don’t have much experience with them.\n\nAnd yet, the New Testament world seems to have been filled with demons. There was the demon-possessed man in Luke 8, whose demon went by the name of “Legion.” And there was the demon-possessed man in Luke 11, who was finally able to speak once Jesus cast the demon out of him. There was the Canaanite woman’s daughter filled with an unclean spirit (see Mark 7 and Matthew 15), whom Jesus was able to heal from afar. And there was the boy suffering from demonic seizures in Matthew 17, who was healed by Jesus after the disciples were unable to do so. \n\nThe list goes on from there, depicting a world quite different from the one we live in now.\n\nOr was it?\n\nThe truth is, our world is no less spiritual today than it was 2,000 years ago. Some cultures are simply less accustomed to recognizing the darkness and the various forms it takes. But “our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms” (Ephesians 4:16). The warfare is real and we’re called to engage it. The stories of Jesus’ power over darkness prepare us for this battle by showing us two truths.\n\nFirst, Jesus has authority over the darkness. In addition to rescuing us from darkness and teaching us how to resist it, Jesus is the King of kings, and there is nothing on this planet or in this cosmos that escapes His royal jurisdiction. As theologian N.T. Wright put it, “[Jesus] isn’t just somebody with good ideas. He isn’t just somebody who will tell us how to establish a better relationship with God. He is somebody with authority over everything that the physical world on the one hand, and the non-physical world on the other, can throw at us. This is a Jesus we can trust with every aspect of our lives.” \n\nSecond, Jesus exercises His authority with His words. Since the beginning of creation, when God spoke the world into existence, His words have had enormous power. We witness this same power when Jesus banishes each demon with a simple command. New Testament scholar Leon Morris explains, “No magic formulae, no mumbo-jumbo. He just told the spirits to go, and they went. That was what astonished people. He didn’t have to summon up stronger powers than his own; he just used the authority he already possessed in himself.”\n\nJesus’ power is a comfort to those of us in Christ. We have access to the same power and the same authority (Luke 10:19; Matthew 16:19). In Jesus’ name, we can rebuke the powers of darkness. We should acknowledge these powers exist, but we need not fear them or become preoccupied with them. Instead, let us wield our words with the same intention and precision as Jesus: creating, inspiring, building up, and fending off the darkness.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Christ Gives Sight",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: John 9:1-41, Matthew 9:27-31, Mark 10:46-52\n\nMy preschool teacher was the first to notice my vision problems. Her suspicions were confirmed after an appointment with my eye doctor. I had a lazy eye, but the treatment was simple: wear a patch over the dominant eye to force the weak eye to strengthen. As a budding young artist, I relished the opportunity to draw a gorgeous new eyeball on my disposable eye patch each morning. I can only imagine how ridiculous I looked, but at the age of four I had little concern for appearances.  \n\nMy eyesight was corrected over time. Not surprisingly, the optometrist never pronounced, “Your faith has healed you!” Rather we assumed modern medicine deserved the credit. My physical sight was nearly perfect, but spiritually I remained blind for many years. \n\nJesus did not heal blindness the same way an ophthalmologist would. \n\nFirst of all, your eye doctor has most likely never rubbed mud on your eyes. Secondly, I doubt your eye doctor has ever discussed your spiritual sight. In my experience, she has you look through a metal contraption and asks, “Which looks better, number 1 or number 2, number 2 or number 3?” Surely this is one of the most confusing tests known to man, but it has nothing to do with your faith. \n\nWhile the multiple accounts of Jesus healing blindness did involve a physical transformation, He always acknowledged a spiritual component. Christ was not satisfied with saving the body; He was even more concerned with saving the soul. \n\nBlindness and sight, darkness and light—these are metaphors Christ often used to describe the spiritual realm. When He healed someone of physical blindness, it was also a statement regarding His power to heal spiritual blindness. \n\nPhysical healing is a wonderful gift. But if we only ask for relief from our temporary afflictions, we are not asking for enough. Jesus came so that “those who do not see will see and those who do see will become blind” (John 9:39). His miracle of sight is alive in all who believe because salvation is a miracle of resurrection. Our eyes have been opened; we were dead, but now we’re alive in Christ Jesus. Faith in Him is a gift from God (Ephesians 2:1-5,8).\n\nWhen God gives us spiritual sight, scales fall from our eyes as they did for the Apostle Paul (Acts 9:18). Our circumstances might remain exactly the same, but our perspective shifts. Where there is hopelessness, Christ offers hope. Where there is fear, Christ offers peace. Where there is hatred, Christ offers love.\n\nWe are all works in progress. None of us has 20/20 vision just yet. But we know from Jesus’ work on earth that He delights in healing our sight. We ought to pray for physical healing because the Lord cares deeply about our entire well-being. But we should pray also for spiritual sight—the miraculous gift of faith that truly saves us. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Christ Restores Broken Bodies",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melissa Zaldivar\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 5:18-26, Matthew 12:10-13, Luke 13:10-17, John 5:1-15\n\nThe migraines started in the winter. At times I was dizzy, other times nauseated, but my head was always pounding. In the summer, I sat across from a doctor as he explained that I had a rare, incurable condition called Diabetes Insipidus. Basically put, my body can’t retain water, which means if I drink a glass of water, it travels through my body in about 25 minutes. It’s an endless cycle of hydration, a thirst that’s never quenched. \n\nAt first, it was a relief just to have an answer. But over time my morale tanked and my body crashed. I found myself using most of my energy just to get the prescribed nine to eleven liters of water into my system each day. There was no cure. No rest.\n\nWhen I read about Jesus healing the man at Bethesda, I come a little undone. Not because all is suddenly well, but because I can so easily imagine the man giving up hope after living on the fringe of community for so long. What I cannot imagine is thirty-eight years of a broken body. One year has been more than enough for me, and a lifetime is far too much to think about if I want to keep my sanity.\n\nBut here’s the thing that really haunts me: Jesus says to the man, “Get up… pick up your mat and walk” (John 5:8). He tells the man to walk, but He doesn’t just mean physically. There’s always a bigger picture with Jesus. \n\nScripture tells us a Jewish festival was taking place at that time in Jerusalem (v.1). The healed man was able to attend the feast as a restored member of society, no longer an outcast. During the celebration at the temple, Jesus finds him and says, “See, you are well. Do not sin anymore, so that something worse doesn’t happen to you” (v.14).\n\nJesus is getting at something much deeper—our sweet Savior is talking about the heart, about spiritual paralysis. He says, in essence, “You think that was bad? There are far worse fates.” Jesus’ charge to walk has a much more significant meaning: to step forward in faith, repent, and believe. The physical healing was never the end of the story.\n\nWhen faced with long-term devastation, we ache because we feel that horrible tension of longing for better while living with broken. To watch Christ administer miraculous healing to broken bodies in Scripture reminds us that one day, we will all be healed and whole and well. But now, today, we live in both broken bodies and a broken world. \n\nThere are days when I go a few hours and forget that my body is broken. But there are also days when I feel myself starting to lose my grip—when I look in the mirror and think to myself, Surely, this is going to stop. And it doesn’t. \n\nSo this is what I do: I take slow, steady sips of water. I take one day at a time. And by His grace, I lean into Jesus, through the long-term illness that keeps me close to Him. When I feel paralyzed by what seems to be both a life sentence and a death sentence, I find that He is ever-present in my struggle (Psalm 46:1).\n\nJesus beckons to me in my broken, crippled body to “pick up my mat, and walk.” He invites me into faith, into a taste of eternity now in relationship with Him. \n\n",

Seemingly chance encounters became life-altering miracles in Jesus’ presence. Power was oozing out of Him, and no one could stop it if they tried, though some certainly did their best.\n\nSometimes I wonder if, for Jesus, performing miracles was like breathing. Every few moments, my chest expands and contracts, taking in oxygen, transforming it, and putting it out in the world again as a different substance. Jesus inhaled and exhaled, and the blind could see and the lame could walk and the near-dead became fully alive. Lungs breathe because they’re lungs. Jesus heals because He’s the Healer. \n\nSo why did He reach out His hand to touch the leper? Why did He touch Peter’s mother-in-law to free her body of fever? Why did He touch the high priest’s servant’s ear rather than simply order it to reattach? We’ve seen how He can speak a storm to stillness or fill a net with fish, all without so much as lifting a finger. But time and time again in the Gospels, Jesus chooses to heal by touch. Why is that? \n\nThe story of the leper in Mark 1 gives us a clue. Read again with me the exchange: \n\nThen a man with a serious skin disease came to Him and, on his knees, begged Him: “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”\n\nMoved with compassion, Jesus reached out His hand and touched him. “I am willing,” He told him. “Be made clean.” Immediately the disease left him, and he was healed (Mark 1:40-43). \n\nDo you see it? It’s love. Jesus used touch to heal because of love.\n\nIt is the kind of love that looks at an untouchable beggar and is moved with compassion. The kind of love that, with a resounding yes, is willing to enter into our sickness and grief. The kind of love that brims with mercy, that would lay down self and die for literally everyone other than Himself. This is the kind of love only Christ can give. This is the love with which Jesus touched and healed those He came to save. \n\nTo be in Christ’s presence is to be changed (2 Corinthians 3:17-18). Sometimes that meant physically. Sometimes—many times—Jesus saw fit to make illness and injury disappear like that storm on the Galilean sea. And we have to assume, for reasons we’ll never understand this side of glory, that sometimes He didn’t. Sometimes He doesn’t. But His presence is no less glorious, no less affecting, no less healing if the wound or ailment remains. Love is who He is. Healing is what He does. It’s how and when He heals that’s the question; and that, like so many other things, we must leave to Him (Isaiah 55:8-9). \n\nBut here’s what we do know: He loves us. He loves us with a love that cannot be comprehended by our limited, yet remarkable, brains, with a love that cannot be conquered by anyone or anything, including death itself. Our illness and injury—be it physical, mental, or emotional—is utterly incapable of keeping us from the Savior’s love. This is His promise to us (Romans 8:35-39).\n\nWe beg, “If you’re willing, make me clean.” And He always, always answers, “I am willing. Be made clean.”  \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Christ Conquers Death",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 9:18-26, Luke 7:11-17, John 11:17-44\n\nIn Matthew 9, we encounter one of the strangest miracles recorded in the Gospels. \n\nA religious leader sought Jesus for help. His daughter was near death, and he knew Jesus could heal her. “Come and lay your hand on her, and she will live,” he begged (v.18). Jesus immediately got up and went to the girl, healing a woman along the way. “Have courage, daughter,” He told the woman, then He continued on (v.22). \n\nWhen Jesus arrived at the religious leader’s house, He made a startling pronouncement to the crowd that had gathered there: “The girl is not dead but asleep” (v.24). And do you know how that lamenting crowd responded? They laughed. We may chastise them in our heads, but can we blame them? The girl was dead, and this man arrived and proclaimed that, no, she wasn’t dead—just napping. \n\nThen Jesus did what only He can do. He brought life from death. He went into the room, took the girl’s hand, and she got up. The one whose death the crowd was grieving stood up and walked out to greet them, alive as can be. \n\nMiracles do not fit a formula. There is no incantation, no guarantee for the super faithful. The nature of miracles can be hard to understand on this side of eternity. But that’s okay, because the miracles themselves are not the point. \n\nIn John 11 we see Jesus raise His friend Lazarus from the dead. But before He does, He pauses for this brief exchange with Martha, Lazarus’ sister:\n\nJesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”\n\nMartha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”\n\nJesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life” (vv.23-25).\n\nWhen I imagine Jesus speaking these words, I suspect He put an emphasis on the “I am” in verse 25. “I am the resurrection”—as if to pose a direct challenge to the notion that He was merely the means of resurrection, rather than the resurrection in the flesh. Jesus knew the temptation we face with miracles is to desire the gift more than the Giver (John 6:26-27). He was quick to make the distinction. \n\nThe Gospel accounts of Jesus conquering death seem like the ultimate of all miracles. But really, they were only a short-term (and yes, miraculous) solution to a long-term problem. The only source of real and lasting hope is not a miracle, but the Messiah. \n\n“I am the resurrection,” Jesus said to Martha. \n\nAs glorious and dazzling as a miracle can be, it has only an ounce of the power and glory of the Savior. \n\nThis is the message behind all these earthly miracles we’ve studied: Jesus is better. Christ didn’t simply delay death a little while; He overcame it once and for all. Death has ultimately died. This we know to be true. \n\n“Have courage, daughter.” In Christ, our hope remains.\n\n",

Hope is tinged with hurt. Faith is shaded by doubt. Lesser, broken things masquerade as love.\n\nReal love is the God who became flesh—a living, feeling human being. He is God with us, rescuing the dying, calling the sinners, and embracing those who are wasting away. Real hope is the God who came to set things right. He came to set the cloudy mirror aside for good so we can see Him, face to face. Real Truth is the Word that created the world, the truth that never ceases to be true. Counterfeits no longer interest her; she is looking for the realest thing. This is why she reads.\n\nShe reads Truth to find Jesus.\n\nAnd He is there, on every page, greater than her triumphs and shame, vaster than her needs and her pain. Those are real, to be certain. But they are the partial, the passing away. Jesus—and Jesus alone—is the Perfect, the Permanent.\n\nThe Truth does not magically erase her suffering or cure her disappointment. It does not negate her struggle or invalidate her sorrow. It does something even better—it leads her into relationship with the One who made her and makes her new, the One who is greater than all of these. The Truth brings her face to face with the God who has never stopped loving His children, who has never failed to do what He says He will do. The Truth is love in black and white—a love that does not change, even when her Bible is closed.\n\nOne day the cloudy mirror will be gone. One day face-to-face is the only way she will see.\n\nUntil then, she reads Truth—not just for answers or equations, help or how-tos. She reads Truth to find the perfect and permanent One. She reads Truth because she needs Jesus.\n\nThe above is an excerpt from the introduction of the book She Reads Truth: Holding Tight to Permanent in a World That’s Passing Away, written by Raechel Myers and Amanda Bible Williams.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Hebrews 11:1-40, Psalm 107:1-9\n\nMy family fell apart after school on a Wednesday afternoon. That Sunday, in a new town, I woke up in a sleeping bag on a stranger’s floor. My mom, sister, and I went to a new church. And even though I hadn’t exactly met Jesus yet, this was the day I met my Boaz. My lowercase-r redeemer in more than a lot of ways.\n\nI can’t bring to memory much about that Sunday morning. I remember the 1st grade Sunday school room with tables pushed together and metal folding chairs around them in the musty basement of an old, new-to-me, church. I remember our very tall teacher and his small, kind wife and the salt-and-pepper hair on both of their heads. They tried their best to keep a room full of enthusiastic seven-year-olds quiet. Most of all, I remember the wild blue eyes and curly blonde hair of the most unruly little boy I’d ever seen. He was the ringleader of the noisy bunch, and he fascinated me.\n\nThat image of Blue Eyes standing on his chair and waving his arms in excitement over who-knows-what will forever be burned in my memory as the moment I met my future husband. Of course, I didn’t know it at the time. I probably thought I was meeting my nemesis. Everything I loved about order was the opposite of him. He was loud, and I felt quiet. Everyone was looking at him, and I’m not sure anyone even noticed me. I didn’t know it that seven-year-old Sunday morning, but Blue Eyes would never stop being a part of my life from that moment on.\n\nThere is truth (our present circumstance), and there is truer truth (the history of God’s unwavering, faithful, covenant relationship with His people). Call it the “grand scheme of things” if you like, but I believe we make a big mistake when we trust God only based on what He’s done for us today, or even in our own lifetime.\n\nIf a telescope zooms our gaze in on one particular thing, God’s Word is like a wide angle lens that shouts, “Remember! God is THIS BIG! He is a God of the big-picture!” When we’re busy dialing in on legitimately important things like jobs and health and deadlines, it can do us a lot of good to remember what God did at creation, and what He promised Abraham. Remember how He kept His hand on Joseph, bringing Israel into Egypt and eventual slavery, then delivering them from slavery at the hand of Moses.

This is why we read Truth.\n\nIt’s okay to study God’s hand in our present circumstances. It’s good and appropriate to move that telescope around to see what other people are dealing with too. But opening God’s Word and studying His character is like lifting our eyes from the viewfinder long enough to remember that the God who calls us His people has been hanging the stars in the heavens since time began. \n\nJust as He was faithful then, He will be faithful now.\n\nThe above is an excerpt from Chapter 1 of the book She Reads Truth: Holding Tight to Permanent in a World That’s Passing Away, written by Raechel Myers and Amanda Bible Williams.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hosea 2:14-23, 2 Corinthians 1:19-22\n\nI’ve been a believer in Jesus since I was five years old.\n\nWe were standing toward the front of our United Methodist chapel, singing from a hymnbook in the pews, my mom and my brother and me. I don’t remember what preceded the moment, but I remember feeling sure that Jesus was real. And I remember feeling sure that I wanted to serve Him. So I closed my eyes and held out my hands, palms up, like I was holding a serving tray. It was exhilarating.\n\nThis was my version of Moses’ “Here I am” (Exod. 3:4). This was childlike faith in its uncomplicated beauty.\n\nAs I grew, my faith grew too. We attended church regularly, and I was as involved as I could be. I went to Sunday school and Bible studies and summer youth trips. I read the Bible outside of church too. I began to journal my prayers. But even as I became more sure of who God was, I became less sure of who I was in relation to Him. The little girl who stood unabashedly before God, eager hands ready to serve, became a teenager who hid like Mother Eve beneath fig leaves of shame.\n\nIt was no longer Moses’ “Here I am” that I echoed in my heart. It was also his disbelief: “Who am I that I should go?” Or, as was more accurate to my line of thinking at the time: who am I that I am worth loving?\n\nThe fullness of the gospel had saved me, but I only seemed to remember half of it.\n\nI knew I needed to be forgiven, but I couldn’t believe I was.\nI knew God’s love was deep, but I thought my sin was deeper.\nI knew Christ accepted me, but I didn’t imagine He’d accepted all of me.\n\nI was a work in process, and I assumed the work was mine to complete. I was a well-intentioned mess, and I thought the mess was mine to clean up.\n\nBut guess what? That wasn’t Truth. God never said I have to clean myself up before I come to Him, to get it right before I trust in Him. He never said I could not or would not be a work in process. Search for these commands in the Bible, and you will come up short.\n\nIn fact, God says the opposite.\n\nThe Bible is full of in-process people, those whom Christ pursued and loved exactly as they were, well-intentioned messes like me. Like you. If we need permission to be in process, we can look to Scripture.\n\n \u2022 I am the woman at the well, taken aback that this man would dare to be seen with me.\n \u2022 I am Zaccheus, standing at a distance and hoping to catch a glimpse of the Messiah.\n\n \u2022 I am Peter, promising I would never deny Him and then turning around to do exactly that.\n\n \u2022 I am Peter, weeping when I meet Jesus’ eyes and realize that I have failed and failed big, again.\n\n \u2022 I am Martha, running around trying to guarantee my worth and everyone else’s happiness.\n\n \u2022 I am Mary, collapsing at His feet because I am so desperate for His presence.\n\n \u2022 I am the adulterous woman, standing guilty for all the world to see\n.\n \u2022 I am the bleeding woman, utterly incapable of healing what ails me.\n\n \u2022 I am a mess, in process, just like all of them. Looking through its pages, I see pieces of me all through God’s Book.\n\nIn God’s Word I’m reminded that I don’t secure my standing before Him by any guarantees I make, or even those I manage to keep. I am secure because He holds me in the safety of His covenant, the same covenant He has kept for generations past and will keep for generations to come.\n\nThe above is an excerpt from Chapter 3 of the book She Reads Truth: Holding Tight to Permanent in a World That’s Passing Away, written by Raechel Myers and Amanda Bible Williams.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: 1 Samuel 2:1-2, Isaiah 40:3-8, 1 Thessalonians 5:16-24\n\nThere was a time not long ago, a season I’ve described in these pages, when anxiety and false expectations covered me like a weighted blanket. As if the oxygen had been sucked out of every room, I couldn’t catch my breath. Then, slowly, the blanket began to lift. Inch by inch it lifted and the air rushed in—when my family loved me anyway, when the doctor understood, when the church held us up, when the long winter finally gave way to spring— until one day I could breathe again. Not the shallow gasps I’d become used to, but deep, lungs-full, eyes-clear breaths. It felt like coming back to life.\n\nThat heavy quilt of circumstance was real and it was stifling, but the gospel was always true, even when the heaviness covered me.\n\nThe gospel is not only for the moment Christ calls us to repent and follow Him. It is for every moment before and every moment after.\n\nIt is for our times of joy and fervor, and our times of doubt and despair.\n\nIt is for the day we stand basking in the bright light of hope, and the day we hide, head in hands, in the dark corners of our fear.\n\nIt is for the hour that just passed and the hour to come, the situation we just stepped out of and the one we’re walking into.\n\nWe need it every minute. The gospel is our oxygen.\n\nBut, here in our temporary home, the gospel can seem intangible and hard to hang on to. So where do we turn when the heavy blanket is closing in, when we’re in the dark, gasping for air?\n\nWe turn to God’s Word.\n\nWhen we turn its pages and take in its Truth, the very breath of God fills our lungs, our heart, our mind, our soul. Whether we come to Him doubting, praising, weeping, laughing, His Word is for us and it is true. In this ever-fading world, God’s Word never fades. We can approach it in any condition, under any circumstance, and IT IS STILL TRUE.\n\nWhen our will is weak, God’s Word is true.\nWhen our faith is fragile, God’s Word is true.\nWhen our hearts are heavy, God’s Word is true.\nWhen we wonder if we even believe it, God’s Word is true.\n\nThe gospel is permanent, even when our belief buckles under the world’s weight.\n\nThe gospel is the reason we can take Paul seriously when he writes, “Rejoice always! Pray constantly. Give thanks in everything” (1 Thess. 5:16–18). It is the reason we can put away our faith formulas and walk side by side with the One who wrote faith into our stories and has promised to finish what He started. It is the reason a girl who’s made promises to God and broken them all can wake up each new day and invite hundreds of thousands of women to read Truth—the truth about the promise God has made to them, and even to her, and how He has kept and still keeps it, every day.\n\nI am basking in the bright light of hope today, but that weighted blanket may be waiting in the wings. Maybe you’re under it now. Jesus promised His disciples they’d have trouble, and we’re guaranteed to have it too (John 16:33; 1 Pet. 4:12).\n\nDarkness and death are weighty, and our emotions, our actions, even our beliefs may bend at their pressure. But our God does not. Even under the blanket, we can echo the prayer of Hannah:\n\nThere is no one holy like the Lord.\nThere is no one besides You!\nAnd there is no rock like our God (1 Sam. 2:2).\n\nLet your chest rise and fall today with the knowledge that the gospel is true. It is oxygen, available every moment of every day, and you can breathe it in. \n\nThe above is an excerpt from Chapter 8 of the book She Reads Truth: Holding Tight to Permanent in a World That’s Passing Away, written by Raechel Myers and Amanda Bible Williams.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Luke 12:4-7, John 3:16-17, 1 Peter 1:3-9\n\nWe took our kids to Disney World for spring break this year.\n\nSince we believe ourselves to be the “go big, just once” type of Disney-goers, rather than the “go briefly and often” type, we booked seven days of park-hopping magic, determined to experience every inch of every park at least twice. Ultimate Disney satisfaction. And, as it turns out, exhaustion.\n\nDisney World is a crowded place. With the spring break crowds added to the mix, we quickly discovered a natural human reflex we called the “Disney Grasp.” By hour six of day five, somewhere between Splash Mountain and Casey’s Corner, Oliver registered a polite complaint, “Mom, I don’t like the way you’re holding my hand. It’s just kind of straight and floppy—I need you to squeeze your fingers around mine.”\n\nThis would have been a darling request in any other setting, but his hand was sweaty, and my fingers were tired and a little stiff from five days straight of hand holding (punctuated, of course, by the thrill of waving freely in the breeze on a fun rollercoaster ride for three minutes every three hours). Oliver wanted me to squeeze with meaning, and at that moment, all I really wanted was to find a quiet place and not be touched or talked to for just a minute.\n\nOf course, I complied. He didn’t want to hold my limp-fish hand and I wanted him to feel secure. I would continue to forget his preferred squeeze-level, however, and he would have to reach across his body and wrap my fingers back around his every hour or so for the rest of our trip. He knew my hand was tired, and I knew he wanted to be held tight, and so I thanked him for reminding me and readjusted my grip.\n\nParent-child relationships can be beautiful examples of how we relate with God. But when it comes to the realities of permanent and passing away, even the most enduring love of a parent cannot hold up. I love my son like crazy, and it is my job to keep him safe, but my hand eventually gives way. I get tired and I forget to hold him tight.\n\nIt’s not that way with God.\n\nBecause everything in this world is fragile, there is no real-life metaphor for holding tight to something that is actually secure. We hold out of fear, we grip out of anxiety or prevention, and we eventually lose our grip every time. But because the gospel of Jesus Christ is permanent, it is not subject to the same shortcomings of anything that is passing away.\n\nHear that.\nThe gospel is not passing away.\nGod does not let go.\n\nThe very nature of the gospel is different than anything else around us. Scripture calls our gospel inheritance “a living hope.” Not a dying hope. The apostle Peter describes it as, “imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you.” And the hope of the not-passing-away gospel is literally being “guarded” by God Himself (1 Peter 1:3–5).\n\nGuarded in heaven by God’s own power. No wonder He tells us not to fear. No wonder He promises we can stake our lives on His Truth. This is why God told Abram, “Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.” It’s why the angel of the Lord said to Mary, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people” (Luke 2:10, emphasis mine).\n\nThe gospel is good news.\nIt is not scary news.\n\nThe gospel calls us to hold tight. But it also reminds us that we are already being held.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Matthew 5:1-16, 1 Chronicles 16:28-34, John 16:22-24\n\nBlessed are the spiritual zeros—the spiritually bankrupt, deprived and deficient, the spiritual beggars, those without a wisp of ‘religion’—when the kingdom of the heavens comes upon them. –Dallas Willard, The Divine Conspiracy\n\nAs believers in Jesus and His gospel of grace, we stand with one foot in the present and one in the future. In the present, right-here world, life is volatile and uncertain. And yet, we know the saying is true: This world is not our home. Our citizenship is in a greater, coming Kingdom—a Kingdom we will only know in part while we live here on earth (Philippians 3:20).\n\nSo how do we do that? How do we live in two worlds at the same time? How do we live in the reality of this present, imperfect world in light of the heavenly life to come?\n\nAt the beginning of Jesus’ longest recorded sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, He speaks eight blessings to the crowd. These blessings, known as the Beatitudes, shed light on the tension you and I are living in as women who trust our Savior, yet face actual pain, poverty, emptiness, and all manner of brokenness in our right-now lives. \n\nThe temptation is to see this list of blessings as a formula to a better, happier life. But as Dallas Willard puts it, “The Beatitudes simply cannot be ‘good news’ if they are understood as a set of ‘how-tos’ for achieving blessedness. They would then only amount to a new legalism” (Willard, Divine Conspiracy). So if the Beatitudes aren’t how-tos, what are they? Put simply, they are facts. They are truths of the kingdom of God.\n\nBecause of the finished work of Jesus on our behalf, the Beatitudes are not a mere wish list or to-do list; they are the blessings that are already ours in Christ. In the vast love, grace, mercy, and goodness of our Savior, the least are given the Kingdom. Those who hunger and mourn, the poor and the meek, the “spiritual zeros”—we are blessed with the riches of Christ. Not just later, but right now, right here. \n\nNo matter how comfortable the house, we’ll never feel fully at home in this world; we were made for the coming one. But while we’re here, we have a job to do. Our job is not to earn our blessings; Jesus did that. Our assignment is to be salt and and light to the very world that makes us fidget with discomfort. As those who carry the life of Jesus around in us, we have a message of hope to offer a dying world (2 Corinthians 4:10). We hold out the Word of Life, inviting our neighbors “to taste and see that the Lord is good” (Psalm 34:8).\n\nAs we study this short but impactful passage at the beginning of Matthew 5, may our hearts assume a posture of gratitude toward the God who grants us His very Kingdom through the life, death, and resurrection of His Son. And as we give thanks for the blessings that are secured for us in Christ, may we be quick to scatter the knowledge of Jesus to those around us.\n\nThe Kingdom is His, and all are welcome. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Matthew 5:3, Ephesians 2:1-10, Revelation 3:17-22\n\n“He only who is reduced to nothing in himself, and relies on the mercy of God, is poor in spirit.” –John Calvin\n\nWhen we were first married, we spent half a year working for a company after they stopped paying us. We had signed a contract for a year, but halfway in they came upon hard times, and the paychecks just stopped. We were committed to the project, had a little money saved up, and didn’t really know what to do, so we finished the contract.\n\nNow that we are older, a little less idealistic, and more laden with responsibilities, we probably wouldn’t be able to manage that. Granted, the word “poor” is relative, and short of insurmountable homeless starvation, we’re all holding on okay. But during that particular season, we were poor. \n\nI don’t like to be poor. I don’t even like to feel poor.\n\nMoney is an insulation from the world. We use it to keep from feeling hungry, cold, and sad. Strength and power insulate us, too—all these things give us the illusion that we are in control. But the “poor in spirit” are those who have no power; they are the demoralized, the dejected. They can be fiscally poor, or lonely, or rejected; but regardless, they have lost all hope of finding power in themselves. \n\nIn the eyes of the world, the poor in spirit are the lowest of the low. People who can’t help themselves, or people who don’t believe in themselves, must not deserve all the good things life has to offer, we reason. We put so much value on hard work and grit that the poor in spirit are the most undervalued members of society.\n\nBut that’s the upside down version. The world is upside down, but Christ sets things right again. When He said “the last shall be first,” He meant it (Matthew 20:16). The poor in spirit have nothing, but that nothingness empties them of the illusion of their own power, enabling them to rely wholly on God. And to those who totally rely on Him, God gives the earth as an inheritance. He doesn’t promise that they’ll conquer the earth in their own power, somehow taking it for themselves; they will inherit the earth. For the meek, the earth will come to them gently, naturally, like a bequest. The world is upside down, but God sets it upright again.\n\nIn an unexpected way, we suddenly have reason to be grateful for the absence of paychecks, the blindsiding blows, and the losses that reduce us to emptiness. Poverty of the heart forces us to rely on the mercy of God. Jesus says they are “blessed” and “happy” who find themselves poor in spirit. Without our insulating security we have no refuge but God, and that blessed contradiction is a glimpse of what earth will look like, right side up, as it is heaven (Matthew 6:10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebekah Lyons\n\nText: Matthew 5:4, Isaiah 61:1-3, Romans 7:21-25, 2 Corinthians 7:8-10\n\nFifteen years ago, during a bleak February chill, I awoke early and jumped in the shower, ready to head back to the hospital. I’d been without our firstborn son—still less than a week old—for almost eight hours. And it was killing me.\n\nThe phone rang, and I heard Gabe answer. I knew it was the doctor calling with the lab results. Sixty seconds crawled by before Gabe cracked open the bathroom door. Seeing the look on his face, I collapsed. \n\nThere will never be words to describe the pain I felt at that moment. I had no idea I was capable of such grief, yet there I was, wailing. I could not shed the anguish fast enough. \n\nGabe and I drove to the hospital in silence. I realized I didn’t know a single person with Down syndrome. I was ashamed I’d overlooked this community, a sorority of mothers whose children had Down syndrome—a sorority to which I now belonged. \n\nSome people have been taught that the Christian life makes no room for sadness, gives no permission to mourn, allows no time for lament. This kind of mental toughness might seem a practical approach for immediate survival, but unexpressed grief can become a bitterness that chokes us. When we dull our pain, we dull our joy. When we numb our lows, we numb our highs. \n\nJesus has a different perspective on grief. He never lacked emotion or expression. He “was a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief” (Isaiah 53:3). And in His impassioned Sermon on the Mount, He gives us this promise: “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted” (Matthew 5:4).\n\nWhen we grieve—not if—we will be comforted. \n\nNot long after His sermon, Jesus experienced this for Himself. “He took Peter and Zebedee’s two sons, James and John, and He became anguished and distressed. He told them, ‘My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me’” (Matthew 26:37).\n\nJesus wept from empathy, from disappointment, from pain. He mourned, and when He was finished mourning, He surrendered to the work of God—work that brought great freedom to all of us. \n\nSince that fateful February morning, I’ve grieved with friends who have walked through fear and loss. Loss of love and marriage vows. Loss of sanity and peace. Loss of life, in the womb and out. And I’ve watched those same folks experience the death of their own will, and by His grace, receive Jesus’ comfort instead. \n\nNone of us wants to encounter such deep grief in our lifetimes. But the more we mourn our sin and need, pain and loss, the more we can trust and anticipate the gracious comfort Christ Jesus promises to bring. \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nText: Matthew 5:5, Luke 12:13-21, Psalm 37:1-11\n\nThese days my daughters have been struck with a heavy dose of the equine magic, something unknowingly passed down from their mama, I suppose. As a child, I whiled away many an afternoon hour at the dining room table, painstakingly working to capture the essence of a mare and her young colt. Occasionally, they’d take flight as a pegasus or grow into a purple-horned unicorn. But more often than not, I fashioned my horses a traditional brown or black—always majestic, racing through a large Crayola®-green pasture, wild, free, and unbridled. \n\nFueling my wonder was a racehorse farm, just down the road from my childhood home. On slow summer mornings, my mother would walk with me, hand-in-hand, to admire the horses. Together, we’d watch them from the outside of endless white fences, their tails flick-flick-flicking away flies in the heat. On rare occasions, she’d lead me to the stables for a closer look, to stroke their muzzles, my fingers tentatively dancing across a velvety smooth coat. I’d stare deeply into the eyes of those beautiful beasts, in awe of their quiet, controlled demeanor—steely strength enveloped in a gentle disposition. \n\nThough humble in temperament and committed to the service of their master, you’d never doubt the power of these statuesque creatures. You would never think them weak. These animals are bred, born, and groomed for a few minutes of all-out greatness, and yet the day-to-day submission of their own will to that of their master’s is somehow equally awe-inspiring. The master has proven to be good and worthy of their trust. And so they wait on him. \n\nCommit your way to the Lord;\ntrust in Him, and He will act…\nBe silent before the Lord and wait expectantly for Him… -Psalm 37:5,7\n\nThis is a picture of meekness: strength and power under control, submitted to the authority of the Father. He created us to bear His image and to bring Him glory (Genesis 1:27; Isaiah 43:7). And while we can honor God in deed and action—in how we run the race—we also glorify Him in our waiting and trusting in Him. We glorify Him in our meekness, too.\n\nScripture tells us Moses was the meekest man on the face of the earth, but he was far from weak (Numbers 12:3). The man who confronted Pharaoh, led the Israelites’ exodus out of Egypt, and parted the Red Sea, was empowered by God Almighty to lead and perform miracles in His name, yet he remained humble in spirit. He was just a foretaste of Jesus Christ, our Savior to come (Matthew 11:29). \n\nHe was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a lamb that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers, So He did not open His mouth. -Isaiah 53:7\n\nJesus had all the authority of heaven and earth given to Him, yet He submitted His will to the Father (Matthew 28:18). The same God who met face to face with Moses endured the cross for the joy set before Him (Hebrews 12:2). He did it for us—we are His joy, His prize. This is the God who fights for us; we need only to be still and wait for Him (Exodus 14:14). \n\nWe live in a world that distracts us from our true inheritance. At every turn, we’re told to make our desires happen now and on our own terms. But that’s orphan living, and we are daughters of the King. All that He has is already ours in Christ Jesus (2 Peter 1:3). Our inheritance is already secure.\n\n",

Yes, specifically the green ones, and no, his stomach does not agree. \n\nThe main reason our goldendoodle puppy keeps finding acorns is because, well, it’s fall and they’re everywhere. He sniffs them out with the same tenacity I use when looking for a stray piece of gum in my purse. Before you know it, he’s crunch-crunch-crunching away. Again. \n\nWe’ve scolded him repeatedly, enrolled him in puppy school, and used lots of bribery. But when it’s not green acorns, he’s gnawing anything from a wooden armchair to a human hand, and at that point, I’ll take the pesky acorn any day. All the while, he ignores his full bowl of dog food, and although I haven’t tasted it myself, I’ll bet it tastes better than all those other things. When will he learn to eat the right things? \n\nBetter yet, when will we?\n\nI’m hungry all the time. Of course, my stomach rumbles when I don’t eat breakfast or eye the pint of ice cream in the fridge, but it’s even more frequent than that—I’m ravenous for approval, control, love, and fulfillment. Instagram likes, friendly compliments, and foolproof plans are my foods of choice. Before I know it, I’m crunch-crunch-crunching away. Again. \n\nBut even after gorging myself, I am still unsatisfied and on to trying the next thing. Anybody else? Friends, we, too, are missing the satisfaction already set out for us—in Christ. \n\n“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.” –Matthew 5:6\n\nI tend to picture the person who hungers and thirsts for righteousness as a total kill-joy, as if this verse is telling them—and us—to go on a strict righteousness cleanse. But it’s not! No, it’s  inviting us into something so much better. Paul explains the distinction like this: “Because they disregarded the righteousness from God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves to God’s righteousness. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes” (Romans 10:3-4).\n\nIf we are left to feed on our own righteousness, we will starve. But when we feed on the righteousness of Christ, we will be satisfied. On the cross, Jesus knew He was the only thing that would satisfy, and even in our longings today, it still rings true. We cannot create or earn righteousness on our own; we can only partake in the gift of His. \n\nIn contrast to our worldly desires that leave us longing and hungry for more, our satisfaction in Christ only increases with our hunger for Him. The more we seek first the kingdom of God, the more we will be fulfilled by His goodness—a taste of eternal satisfaction in the life to come. \n\n“But I will see Your face in righteousness; when I awake, I will be satisfied with Your presence.” \n–Psalm 17:15\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: Matthew 5:7, James 2:15-20, Matthew 18:21-35\n\nI recently deleted the Facebook app from my phone in an effort to scroll less and live more. I’ve begun to realize how often I scroll and just how terrible it makes me feel. A quick scan of my social media feed this morning inspired plenty of emotion in me, but not an ounce of understanding, compassion, or grace. \n\nWe live in a time of outrage, not of mercy. \n\nReading all these passages about mercy, then writing about it and thinking about it, only made me more confused. It’s like when you stare at a word so long that, suddenly, it no longer seems to be spelled correctly, or the true meaning of the word escapes you altogether.\n\nSo what exactly is mercy? And why do I see so little of it in my own heart for others?\n\nAfter thinking it over and working through these scripture passages, this is the best I’ve got: mercy is standing before someone who deserves punishment, and then throwing them a party instead. You’d think it would be easy to accept a free party. But we’ve all been taught from an early age that “there’s no free lunch.” How can we live in a world of dollars and cents, blame and responsibility, and yet still accept mercy? \n\nThe story in Matthew 18 shows just how hard that is. We’re not told why this man had so much debt, but it’s probably safe to say he over-leveraged himself or gambled his way into oblivion. He did something that the rest of the world—from a place of safety or self-righteousness—might call foolish. And yet the king took pity on him, forgiving not only his debt, but also the character flaws that had landed him in debt in the first place. \n\nBut when the forgiven man walked out of the king’s presence, he made a beeline for the first person he could think of who owed him money. What if the king were to change his mind? Perhaps next time, the king won’t be so merciful. And so, loved by a king, the man became a tyrant.\n\nFurthermore, his beliefs about the king became a self-fulfilling prophesy. He didn’t trust mercy, so he didn’t extend mercy, which landed him in prison—exactly where he’d expected to end up all along. When he reached prison, I imagine he felt justified: I knew he’d come after me all along.\n\nThis man’s behavior is familiar territory. At times, I find that I expect God to come back around, change His mind, and demand payment for all of my mistakes. Worst of all, I believe the difficult situations that come my way are His punishment in disguise, rather than believing the circumstances of my life are God’s best for me. But God has no punishment left for us (Romans 8:1).\n\nGod is not waiting for me to mess up. He is not standing, ready with a long list of all my other failures, to justify why the mercy I thought I received didn’t actually count. Jesus loves me—and you—fully, deeply, permanently. It is final and it is finished (John 3:16; 19:30). \n\nThinking through all this helps me to see myself and the people around me with new eyes. It even changes the way I look at my Facebook feed, believe it or not. There is no one we’ll encounter today, on our social media feeds or elsewhere, who is not in need of mercy. And you and I have the privilege of extending it to them, because Christ has secured irrevocable mercy for us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Matthew 5:8, Ezekiel 36:22-28, Psalm 24:1-10, Revelation 22:1-5\n\nThe doctor’s office wasn’t on my list of must-see destinations in Italy, but it’s the one I got to check off the list just 72 hours into my semester abroad. \n\nI’d intentionally chosen a program without any familiar faces—just me and the open road! Instead, it was just me… and the scratching. And the hives.\n\nThe minute the itchiness ensued, I immediately began washing all my clothes and sheets, then used every last drop of my brand-new bottle of soap in the shower. But it got worse, sending me to the farmacia, which was closed, followed by the doctor’s office, all the while accompanied by a translator who did not know the word for “hives.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time I’d taken matters into my own hands, working to scrub away my flaws for a pristine exterior. Just today, I’ve held doors, given compliments, and tweeted Scripture—which are all good things, but my motives are off. And do you know what I see when I do these things? Nothing. I’m hiding so well that I don’t see a thing—not myself, and definitely not God. \n\nSitting in the doctor’s office chair, I listened to the translator and the doctor intensely converse, unable to decipher what they were saying. Then, the translator turned to me, diagnosing an allergic reaction to an ingredient specific to Italian soap and detergent. \n\nWhat I’d been using to hide and treat my condition was actually the root of my problem. My attempts to outwardly correct my inward shame had only exposed it more. \n\nWhen I read, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (Matthew 5:8), I’m sent scrambling, trying to scrub my heart of its impurities. Reading that verse makes me want to work harder and look better. But in reality, I start to hide more, feel less, and then wonder why I can’t see God in the midst of my shame.\n\nI want to see Him. I want to see Him so badly that I’ve shamed my sinful heart into hiding. But Praise the Lord, He is not hiding from us, and nothing is hidden from Him. God sees us and knows us long before we could ever think to seek Him. He saw us first. \n\nFor “Man does not see what the Lord sees, for man sees what is visible, but the Lord sees the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7). He sees us when we are impressive, as well as indecent. He knows our hiding places and wants to give us a better one (Psalm 32:7). \n\nWhile we are busy trying to correct our outward behavior and conceal our inward brokenness, we miss the work God is already doing:\n\n“For I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.” –Ezekiel 36:24-28\n\nBy His grace, may we stop hiding from Him in shame, and instead turn to face the One who has already blessed us with the purity of Christ and washed us clean.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: Matthew 5:9, Matthew 10:26-31, Ephesians 2:11-22, John 14:27-31, Psalm 34:1-22\n\nThe womb is where I learned that relationships take work. I shared the space with my twin sister, Nikki. With four elbows, four knees, and twenty fingers and toes jammed into such cramped corners, I doubt peace was a part of my prenatal development. I’ve been fighting for peace in my relationships ever since. \n\nYou too?\n\nI’m not sure where we got the impression that once life reaches a certain cruising altitude, we can wave goodbye to turbulence. Every era in history is marked with wars and rumors of wars, and every decade of our lives brings its share of tensions, squabbles, and cold shoulders. Turmoil is a constant in our changing world. Jesus was not naïve to this reality. He calls us to pursue peace anyway. \n\nIf you read through the Beatitudes as a list of dos and don’ts, you might find yourself tripping on this one: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God” (Matthew 5:9). \n\nAre you able to change the habits that wreak havoc on your relationships? If you were, you would have done it already. \n\nAre you able to force reconciliation between your bickering children or squabbling neighbors? Probably not. There’s strike two. \n\nAre you able to resolve the conflicts raging across the geopolitical landscape? Nope. Strike three!\n\nBut where we are weak, Christ’s power is made perfect (2 Corinthians 12:9). The gospel never fails to shoot up a beacon of hope. \n\nThis list of blessings handed down from Jesus goes far beyond a checklist for right living. It lays the groundwork for the gospel. We can’t begin to get relief in our relationships or to move toward others in reconciliation without first looking to the cross. \n\nTrue peace is a byproduct of Christ’s work of the cross. True reconciliation begins with His work on our behalf, then bubbles over into our connections with each other. We can only be peacemakers by carefully following Christ’s lead. \n\nApart from Jesus, we were once left in a sorry state: separated, alienated, hopeless strangers— alone (Ephesians 2:11-12). “But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility” (vs. 13-14). \n\nApart from Christ, all of life is war. We war within ourselves as we rebel against God’s best. We war against others as our sin sends shrapnel into one another’s hearts. The cross is the only bridge to true peace. \n\nThe beautiful message of the gospel is that Jesus Himself is our peace. The cross worked like a sledgehammer, tearing down the wall of hostility we erected with our own sin. He simply asks us to wave the white flag of surrender to His work of reconciliation. \n\nThis reminder gives us what we need to pursue reconciliation with others. The grace that has been lavished upon us gives us the strength to extend grace to others. We can forgive because we’ve been forgiven, pursue peace because we serve the Peacemaker, mend broken relationships because we’ve been stitched up with the thread of grace. \n\nThis process of pursuing reconciliation also gives us a taste of what’s to come; it’s a preview of an eternity marked with perfect peace. Hostility will end. Tears will dry. Apologies will become antiquated. Those of us who have surrendered our lives to the Peacemaker will be blessed indeed.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nText: Matthew 5:10-12, Philippians 1:27-30, 2 Timothy 3:10-17, 1 Peter 1:6-7\n\nThe internet is not for the faint of heart. Maybe you’ve noticed this, too. Behind the protection of a computer screen and social media, people lose their inhibitions and speak with a recklessness they wouldn’t otherwise. Strangers, acquaintances, and even friends launch virtual grenades that leave behind very real wounds.\n\nI learned this lesson the hard way, soon after I started writing. Each week, I poured my heart and soul into words about Jesus, hoping to build up my readers while challenging them in their faith. I studied and prayed and edited and dreamed, and then, I released my ideas into the world. I remember hitting the “publish” button one of those first very times and, thirty minutes later, a comment appeared from one of my precious readers: “The author sounded whiney.”\n\nCome to find out, this would be one of the gentler comments in a string of skin-thickening insults. It was my cold-splash initiation into the world of writing online, a world that is sometimes beautiful and sometimes brutal.\n\nThese experiences have taught me a lot over the years, but one lesson always stands out. When someone insults you, there is a subtle temptation lurking just behind it: to tear your critic down in the form of sympathy. “He is probably just a sad person,” or “Hurt people hurt people,” or “She’s just jealous.” I have said all of these things and more, and some of those assessments might even be true. But Jesus’ response to insults looks radically different.\n\nIn Matthew chapter 5, Jesus doesn’t focus on His critics’ motives. Instead, He points to the kingdom of God: “You are blessed when they insult and persecute you and falsely say every kind of evil against you because of Me. Be glad and rejoice, because your reward is great in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you” (vv. 11-12).\n\nIt doesn’t matter how you were brought low—you meek, you downtrodden, you spiritual misfits—because God works wonders among the lowly. If people slander you or insult you because of Christ’s name, you don’t have to cower and you don’t have to flee, because the other side of death is always, always resurrection. Not around the shame, but through it.\n\nThis, in many ways, is the entire message of the Beatitudes.\n\nBut the news gets even better. This Kingdom isn’t some far-off reality. We’re tasting it now. The blessing is already here. We rejoice, not because the reward is distant, but because it’s near. Amidst the insults, the name-calling, the persecution and the slander, God does some of His very best work. He heals. He humbles. He overcomes strongholds. He seizes our fragile idols and shatters them on the ground. He takes our shame and our humiliation and He makes them submit to His reign. And that, my friends, is why we rejoice.\n\nWe don’t have to be afraid. We don’t have to feel threatened or timid about the truth, as if we have to defend it, or ourselves, to keep our joy. The Beatitudes remind us that God’s upside down Kingdom doesn’t work that way. God’s ways are higher than our ways, and our call is to bear witness to that truth. \n\nWe don’t have to let the fear of insult or persecution sway us from obedience. Instead, we can step into it with confidence, knowing God’s good plans for the persecuted. Even in our hurt and shame, the Kingdom is breaking in, and our lives are a big, bright flashing signpost beckoning the world to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Matthew 5:13-16, Colossians 4:5-6, Isaiah 42:5-9\n\nYou know that scene in It’s a Wonderful Life where George and Mary help the Martini family move into their new home? They load up the Martini children (and goat) into their car and drive them to Bailey Park, entourage-style, a truck piled high with the family’s belongings following behind them. As the townspeople gather triumphantly on the stoop of the Martinis’ new home, Mary offers this housewarming blessing:\n\n“Bread, that this house may never know hunger. Salt, that life may always have flavor.” Then George jumps in and takes over because he just can’t help himself: “And wine, that joy and prosperity may reign forever!”\n\nI’ve always loved that scene. It’s so hopeful, so filled with joy and promise. We want to believe that George and Mary’s best wishes can bestow true blessing on the young family, but we know the turmoil that lies ahead for the small, fictional town. Like the folks of Bedford Falls would discover, we know best wishes don’t bring life. Only God can do that.\n\nThat’s what we find when we read the Beatitudes: blessings only God can give, promises only Jesus can make. These aren’t just promises for our future—though they are certainly that. They are promises for our right-now life. They are promises of God’s kingdom come here on earth as it is in heaven.\n\nThis is the gospel. Sinners—ordinary, imperfect people like you and me—are ushered into the kingdom of God by none other than God’s own Son. Jesus came to this pain-ridden planet and lived the holy, sinless life we couldn’t, then paid the debt of our sin in full on the cross. Three days after it was finished, He walked out of the grave, and He sits at the right hand of His Father even now. And there, now, He claims as His own—holy and blameless children of the Father—we who accept the absurd gift of His grace.\n\nWe are heirs with Christ to God’s kingdom. We belong there. It is our home.\n\nWe mourn the pain and death and injustice of our right-now world, but we rejoice in the One who will dry every tear (Revelation 21:4). We are poor in spirit, in possessions, in esteem, yet we are filled up by the One who created all things and holds all things together (Colossians 1:16-17). We hunger for a holiness that we can’t reach here, while we give thanks to the One who clothes us in His righteousness (Romans 5:17). We ache for mercy and peace in a warring world, and we worship the One who is setting everything right (Revelation 21:5).\n\nWe are children of the Kingdom—not just when we leave this world, but right here in it.\n\nThe gospel of Jesus is not a secret to be kept. It is the conspicuous, live-changing reality for every single person who calls Christ their Lord. It is the very definition of good news! How can we help but overflow with gratitude and love for the God who has rescued us from despair and secured our hope?\n\nOur God has made us a beacon of hope to the world, “a covenant for the people and a light to the nations, in order to open blind eyes, to bring out prisoners from the dungeon, and those sitting in darkness from the prison house” (Isaiah 42:6-7). We are light bearers, sight givers, and freedom bringers—this is our reality in Christ. \n\nFriends, we have so much more to offer the world than our best wishes. We know the Maker of love, the Giver of life. When others look at us, may they see Him. Amen. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: Matthew 27:57-66, Matthew 28:1-15\n\nMy husband is deathly afraid of heights. \n\nHis fear only emerges every now and then. At the lake, for instance, when invited to go cliff-jumping with friends, and he declines. Or after finally reaching the summit of a long hike, when I step forward to peer over the edge, and he takes a giant step back. His fear isn’t debilitating—it’s just always there, lingering. So I didn’t anticipate his reaction when I booked our “doors off” helicopter tour over Hawaii. \n\nThere we were, safety floatation devices secured, boarding the Hughes 500, which felt more like a toy car than a helicopter. As the propeller sliced through the air and we lifted off, I could barely contain my thrill. My husband, on the other hand, could barely contain his breakfast.\n\nFear hits us all, sometimes when we least expect it, and sometimes in the exact same place,  over and over again—no matter how many times the pilot tells us we’re safe. \n\nIn the days after Jesus’ crucifixion, we see how several different groups of people reacted to fear. Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Christ, courageously asked Pilate for Jesus’ body, then wrapped it in linen, and placed it in a tomb he’d previously bought for himself. Jesus’ friends, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, resolved to sit and wait and watch the tomb where Jesus was laid.\n\nMeanwhile, paranoia had overcome the chief of priests and Pharisees. Together, they convinced Pilate to send guards to the tomb—just in case the story wasn’t over. They feared Jesus’ disciples would steal His body and proclaim His resurrection (Matthew 27:57-66).\n\nA crew of centurions was sent to keep watch over the sealed tomb—a boring assignment; mundane work. Standing. Waiting. Guarding the grave of a dead man. What do they think is going to happen here?, they must have thought.  \n\nBut then, the earth shook. Rocks crumbled. The stone covering the grave rolled back, and an angel of the Lord appeared, his clothes white as lightning. “The guards were so afraid… they shook and became like dead men” (Matthew 28:1-4).\n\nWhat were they so afraid of?\n\nMaybe they were afraid of the earthquake, and afraid of the stranger strong enough to roll away the stone. Maybe they were afraid of being killed for treason, having lost the body of Jesus, an enemy of the state (Matthew 28:11-15). Maybe it was all of the above. \n\nThe centurions were afraid of dying, when the cure for death had been resurrected right in front of them.\n\nMary and Mary Magdalene encountered this same angel of the Lord. Trembling, they listened as an angel proclaimed that Jesus had defeated death, just as He said He would. He was risen! The story wasn’t over! What did they feel when they heard the news? \n\n“So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy…” -Matthew 28:8\n\nAfraid yet filled with joy. I love those words! \n\nIf you are afraid of who God might be, you’re not alone. The story of Jesus’ gruesome death and quaking resurrection should shake us to our core, just as it did the guards at the tomb. But believers have this distinct and extraordinary gift: our fear lives side by side with our joy. He is who He said He is—the very Son of God. What a fearsome, wonderful thought! \n\nOn the day of our helicopter ride, my husband was so nervous he couldn’t even look out onto the island thousands of feet below. But as we rode over the mountains and the Pacific Ocean, he saw me—smiling and pointing, unable to contain my enthusiasm—and he could look. Still afraid, yet filled with joy.\n\nThank you, Jesus, that Your glory is greater than our fear. When the world cowers in fear or tries to explain You away, give us courage to hold out the gospel. For You have defeated death itself. You alone are our joy. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sarah Matheny\n\nText: John 20:11-23\n\nNo one will ever accuse me of needlessly holding onto things. I consider myself organized, if not clutter-loathing. An older relative of mine, on the other hand, lands far on the other end of the spectrum. She just so happens to currently have seven cars parked in her driveway. And though I get frustrated having to play automobile Tetris each time I go to her house for dinner, her reasoning for possessing these cars is actually quite sweet—they belonged to her loved ones.\n\nAmong the vehicles are her father’s Cadillac, her mother’s Honda, and the barely-driveable GMC minivan that her now-grown children practically lived in for most of their middle-school and high-school sports careers. I’ve tried multiple times to convince her to donate these cars to a charitable organization, but she just can’t bear to let go. She wants to hold on.\n\nThis sentiment of holding on to the past is one most of us can, at least somewhat, relate to. But it is even more exaggerated and understandable when we see Mary experiencing the risen Christ for the first time. When Mary finally realizes that the man talking to her outside the tomb is not the gardener but Jesus Himself, she addresses Him as “Rabboni,” meaning “my great teacher.” She sees Him as the person He was to her in His time on Earth, the man in the flesh, not what He is now—her Lord and Savior.\n\nOf course she would want to hold on to Him! He was the man who had quite literally set her free from the hold of demons. He had been her friend and her mentor. The last time Mary had laid eyes on Jesus, He had been brutally murdered—crucified—and she’d been weeping over the loss of Him for the past three days.\n\nBut Jesus wanted more for Mary than for her to cling to the past. He wants more for us, too. He had returned to give an assignment and to make a promise.\n\n“Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” -John 20:17\n\nJesus gives a similar commission when He appears to His disciples, who are locked in a meeting room upstairs. He greets them with peace but does not linger. Instead, He promises that His very presence will be with them now and into eternity. With a first-hand account of His resurrection and Jesus’ guarantee of help from His Holy Spirit, the disciples are sent off to do the work of setting others free with the message of the gospel (Matthew 28:19-20).\n\nJesus calls us, as the Church, to that same beautiful work. Are we sharing the good news of His life, death, and resurrection? Are we parking it away in our hearts, or are we passing it on? What keeps us from sharing the gospel with those who need its truth just as desperately as we do?\n\nIf the sound of Christ’s commissioning words in John 20:21, “I am sending you,” causes a lump of fear, or pride, or disbelief to rise in your throat, remember this: when we take the gospel to others, just like those first disciples, we are not sent out alone. We bring with us His Word, planted in our hearts (Psalm 119:11). We bring with us the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:11), Who grows good fruit in us (Galatians 5:22-23). We bring the security of knowing our home is not here, but in eternity with God (Philippians 3:20).\n\nThis holy work—done in fellowship with the very Spirit of the risen Christ—is an immeasurable gift, worth more than anything else we cling to. We have been invited to tell a lost and aching world the truth of the resurrected Jesus. We’ve been asked to tell others Who He is and how fully He loves us. By God’s grace, may we do that today and every day—right here, and to the ends of the earth.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Encounters with Christ: On The Road to Emmaus",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Luke 24:13-35\n\nChrist’s walk with the disciples on the road to Emmaus is legendary. For years, I’ve watched people’s eyes glaze over as they sigh, “If only we could have heard that conversation! What I would give to hear Jesus explain the whole of Scripture!” It does feel like the golden ticket: the interpretation of Christ’s place in Scripture, beginning with Moses and the prophets, given by Christ Himself.\n\nBut even if the conversation were recorded and we had one more chapter there in Luke, detailing the truth in red letters, shining brightly in every Bible—would it make a difference? Would it make the Bible a better, more complete account? Would it finally give us the missing piece to complete our greater understanding of Scripture and godliness?\n\nAbsolutely not. Scripture is complete (Revelation 22:18-19). It’s also filled with interpretations, prophecies, and explanations of Christ’s place in God’s plan of redemption, from Genesis to Revelation. But this encounter with Christ on the road to Emmaus does feel special somehow.\n\nIt’s as if we can hear the disciples imploring, “Stay with us!” We can see Christ allowing them to savor those extraordinary moments with Him, their hearts “ablaze” from the truth and love shared in that rare, sweet conversation (John 24:29, 32).\n\nScripture is not a secret code. It is a revelation, shining light on everything under the sun. Yes, there is a rich mystery and paradox in a Creator who would send His own Son to die for His creation. But the gospel itself is not a secret. The gospel is simple:\n\n“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.” -John 3:16\n\nThere’s really only one story: the knight slays the dragon and rescues the princess (Isaiah 25:8). The gospel is in all of our stories. \n\nBut we don’t have to see it if we don’t want to. We can delude ourselves into believing that the gospel is too complicated to understand. Nevertheless, Christ brings light and truth (John 8:12). On the road to Emmaus, “He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,” and He has sent His Holy Spirit to do the same for us now (Luke 24:45; John 14:26).\n\nAmazingly, the longing we feel when reading about the Emmaus encounter is fulfilled in the Holy Spirit. Like those disciples, our hearts implore, “Stay with us!” and Christ answers, “Lo, I am with you always” (Matthew 28:20). He is indeed with us, and He continues to set our hearts ablaze by His abiding Spirit.\n\nWe, too, are called to be people of the Word and to walk by the Spirit. We can go forth in His freedom and light! We can know our Bibles and see that God’s redemptive hand has been at work for our good from the Old Testament through the New Testament, and even still today. We are rescued by His love and transformed by His redemption. The truth of the gospel is laid plain for us in Scripture, and Christ is with us! Thanks be to God.\n\n“Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. . . No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.” -Deuteronomy 30:11,14\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Encounters with Christ: Thomas",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: John 20:24-31\n\nThere was a period in my life when I identified with Thomas’ doubts. I read his story and was uncertain about the basics of my own faith. I questioned what I believed. Was Jesus who He said He was, and did He really rise from the grave? Has His resurrection truly brought me my salvation? Like Thomas, I wanted to see Him in the flesh and lay my hand on His scars.\n\nIt was a hard but good place to be. Wrestling with doubt and being honest about our questions can bring us to a deeper faith in a powerful way. \n\nThese days, I don’t spend as much time struggling with this type of doubt. By His grace, the Lord has somehow brought me to a more secure place, and I’m grateful that I no longer doubt as I used to. But as I read this story in John again, I realize it’s not that my doubting days are over, it’s just that my doubting looks different now.\n\nI think we’re all “Doubting Thomases” in our own way. Maybe I don’t doubt my faith as much as I once did, but I doubt other things. Take God’s character, for instance. I’ve sometimes wondered, Is He really good? Does He care for me? He was faithful those other times, but will He be faithful this time?\n\nSome days, I doubt the cross and its effectiveness in my life. I get stuck on questions like, Did Jesus really save me? Does His sacrifice still count, even when I continue to commit this same sin again and again?\n\nI doubt Christ’s steadfast love and the permanence of His forgiveness. Surely He’ll give up on me this time. Surely I’m no longer worthy to be called God’s child. Surely grace is for everyone else, but not for me.\n\nNo matter where we are in our faith/doubt journey, we all struggle with unbelief. That’s what makes Thomas’ story so encouraging. Although we doubt and question and are fearful in different ways, the answer—the proof we need—is the same for us as it was for Thomas. It’s found in Jesus’ words:\n\n“Put your finger here and observe My hands. Reach out your hand and put it into My side. Don’t be an unbeliever, but a believer.” -John 20:27\n\nI think it’s incredible that we serve a God who doesn’t shun us in our doubts but actually moves toward us in the midst of them, offering us the proof we’re asking for. In the midst of our unbelief, Jesus tells us to look to Him in order to believe again.\n\nWhat do you need to believe in today?\n\nIs it the basics of your faith? Look at the resurrection.\nObserve the scars on His hands and put your hand into His side.\n\nIs it God’s goodness? Look at God’s Son whom He sent to save us.\nObserve the scars on His hands and put your hand into His side.\n\nIs it His grace? Look at the cross.\nObserve the scars on His hands and put your hand into His side.\n\nJesus’ scars are not only our proof—they are our hope for every doubt. They are the Truth that casts out every fear and lie.\n\nJesus comes to us just as He came to Thomas in that room with the disciples. He invites us to see and believe for ourselves, so that we may trust in the resurrection and what it means for us—and what it will mean for us, every day of our lives and after.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Encounters with Christ: Peter’s Reinstatement",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebekah Lyons\n\nText: John 21:1-25\n\nAs darkness settled, Peter decided to go fishing.\n\nMaybe he thought it was the only thing left that he could control. Jesus, whom he loved, had died and risen again. He was overjoyed in knowing his beloved teacher and friend was alive, but guilt-ridden after denying Him (John 18:15-27). His shame had led him here, to familiar waters. With a few trusted friends by his side, Peter pushed off from the shore.\n\nVenturing out into the night, I imagine he looked for solace in the stars. Perhaps he hoped his old everyday routine would bring comfort. He cast his nets far to the left of the boat, but it was a no-go—the expert fisherman couldn’t catch a thing all night (John 21:3-4).\n\nAs the sun rose, they drifted toward the beach and looked up to find the Son of God standing on the shore, though they didn’t recognize Him.\n\n“‘Men,’ Jesus called to them, ‘you don’t have any fish, do you?’\n\n‘No,’ they answered.\n\n‘Cast the net on the right side of the boat,’ He told them, ‘and you’ll find some.’ So they did, and they were unable to haul it in because of the large number of fish. Therefore the disciple, the one Jesus loved, said to Peter, ‘It is the Lord!’” (John 21:5-7).\n\nRight then and there, Peter jumped into the water and swam to shore. Despite the angst in his own heart, he couldn’t help but be drawn to another encounter with his Savior and friend. However, there was still unfinished business between them. Before sending him out into the world to help rescue the souls of unbelievers, Jesus would gently restore Peter to Himself (Matthew 18:16-20).\n\nJesus had a feast waiting for them upon the shore—breakfast a la cookout, I like to call it—a hearty portion of grilled fish and bread, prepared for everyone (John 21:12-13). After they ate their fill, Jesus and Peter stole some moments alone. Jesus had come to do for Peter what He longs to do for each of us: He had come to remove Peter’s shame.\n\nAnd so for each of the three times Peter denied Him, Jesus asked:\n\nDo you love me?\nYes, Lord.\nFeed my lambs.\n\nDo you love me?\nYou know I love You.\nShepherd my sheep.\n\nDo you love me?\nYou know everything. You know that I love you.\nFeed my sheep.\n(John 21:15-17, my paraphrase)\n\nWhat I love most about this exchange is Jesus’ immediate grace toward Peter after the resurrection. Jesus knew Peter would likely carry the shame and guilt of his denial for the rest of his life, unless He intervened. The point of the cross, after all, was that guilt and sin would no longer hold us captive.\n\nThe resurrection power of Jesus sought Peter out, reminding him of everything they’d ever known in their friendship. First, Jesus once again confirmed His love for Peter, and allowed Peter to express his love in return. Then, He gave Peter instruction on how to further this message of love, the gospel. Despite Peter’s denial, his place in the Kingdom never changed. Jesus’ plan and purpose for him remained the same.\n\nWhen I think of all the ways I’ve blown it, the innumerable ways my actions should’ve thwarted God’s plan and call upon my life, I’m exceedingly humbled. In spite of our shortcomings, God promises to complete His good work in each of us (Philippians 1:6). His power and His love for us are far greater than our sin and shame.\n\nThis is the good news! This is the gospel.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Luke 24:36-53, John 16:4-33, Hebrews 10:11-14\n\nAs a kid growing up in Michigan—all blonde braids and denim overalls—I was sure that heaven must be a wonderful place, and equally certain that I was bound to see all the animals I loved there. I was less sure how I felt about worshipping and bowing around a big throne for all of eternity. And I was skeptical about angels and beasts saying, “Holy, holy, holy” (Revelation 4:8). Why so repetitive, anyway? And when would we get to eat clove-flavored gumdrops and jump on clouds?\n\nThe world has a lot to say about heaven, but much like my childhood vision, it’s often far more informed by wistful thinking than by Scripture. But wherever and whatever heaven is, we do know this to be true: when Christ left His disciples, He ascended to heaven (Luke 24:51), and “after offering one sacrifice for sins forever,” He “sat down at the right hand of God” (Hebrews 10:12). \n\nGod is in heaven, and Jesus sits at His right hand.\n\nI love having firm answers to biblical questions. Because honestly, my kids ask me stuff like this all the time, and I want to be a good and accurate teacher for them. The concept of Christ ascended to heaven could make us feel like Christ has disappeared from earth, but His ascension to His place at God’s right hand actually changes everything.\n\nThe Bible tells us that God the Father is Spirit, and He does not have a body like we do (John 4:24; Colossians 1:15). Jesus, on the other hand, does have a body, and He ascended in that body to His Father in heaven (Luke 24:39). Scripture also gives a glimpse, however limited, of the future awaiting us when our own bodies are raised even as Jesus was (I Corinthians 15:52; Romans 6:4). \n\nWe don’t know all the details of what heaven looks like, or how it will feel to be in the presence of God (though I reckon it’s going to be good!). We do, however, know that Christ is seated, signifying that His work is complete, and this changes not only our future, but the here and now. \n\nWhy? Because only by His ascension do we receive His Spirit (John 16:7). And our ascended Christ is, even now, interceding for us at the throne of God (1 Timothy 2:5; Romans 8:34). Jesus, right this instant, is serving as our High Priest! He has gone on to heaven to prepare a place for us (John 14:2), and He’s guaranteed to return for us, when He will judge both the living and the dead (John 14:3; 1 Peter 4:5).\n\nWhat difference does this knowledge make to us now? It turns our sorrows into joy (John 16:20)! \n\nBecause Christ’s work is complete, our salvation is secure. His ascension and enthronement mean that our hope is sure, and we can have confidence as we approach the throne of grace, and joy as we serve Him here (Ephesians 3:12).\n\nHeaven will be beyond our wildest dreams. I don’t know if there will be old dogs, or gumdrops, or cloud-jumping—though I wouldn’t put any of that past our God in His never-ending goodness to His children. Nevertheless, what great comfort it is to know that the Christ who died for us has ascended to heaven and waits for us there. We can be confident, not only of the good things to come, but of His loving, mediating work on our behalf this very day. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: 1 Corinthians 15:1-11, Romans 6:1-11\n\nThe idea of summer camp has always been idyllic, adorable, and… decidedly not for me. This is probably due to the fact that the mere suggestion of talking before 10am deeply offends me. A morning person I am not.\n\nThe one time I allowed myself to be sucked into the bizarre vortex of sleep-away camp, a chipper name-tagged counselor welcomed me by shoving my bags onto a mothballed bunk bed and explaining that, for him, the best part of camp was all the cheers.\n\nAwesome!\n\nOf course I was fully prepared to fake a pom-pom allergy. But oh-what-bliss to learn that fate aligned those cheering sessions for ALL campers with the rising of the sun each and every morning. And here I was, thinking I would avoid sunrise altogether as per usual. No such luck.\n\nSomehow, the happy-clappy counselors and campers arose every morning with spirit just surging through their fingertips, while my hands searched for the closest cup of caffeine.\n\nI was in awe of their energy and became convinced their beds were hiding springs to help propel them from the warm sheets I couldn’t seem to leave. No matter how many times they spelled “S-U-P-E-R” or high-fived for friendship, one thing was clear: cheering was for the morning people, and I was not one of them.\n\nAfter reading the incredible details about Jesus’ ascension, I’m the first to claim my role as the story’s spectator, taking a step back to watch “The Resurrection and the Life” do His thing. Because that’s what you do with a miracle, right? You stare, applaud—maybe even cheer—and retell the tale to your wide-eyed grandchildren. It would seem our place is to stand in awe and wonder at what it might feel like to suddenly spring forward, being catapulted from death into life.\n\nBut because His grace toward us was not ineffective, we don’t just marvel at the power of the resurrection; we feel its rumble in our own hearts (1 Corinthians 15:10).\n\nChrist doesn’t want us to be courteous bystanders of His work on the cross. His hope is not for us to watch and wonder what it would be like to be raised by the glory of the Father. He came so that we could join Him and go wading in the resurrection waters with Him.\n\nChrist’s eternal transformation isn’t just a miracle to be proclaimed—it’s a change we get to feel and experience. Because we are joined in His likeness, when He is raised, so are we.\n\n“For if we have been joined with Him in the likeness of His death, we will certainly also be in the likeness of His resurrection… if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him. -Romans 6:5,8\n\nWe join Him in defeating death.\nWe join Him in a heavenly home.\nWe join Him in grasping grace.\nWe join Him, and He transforms us.\nWe can find ourselves there with Christ in His resurrection, actively walking out the newness He purchased for us. He died and returned to life so that we can too. Christ’s resurrection purpose is to make us resurrected people. \n\nIf there were ever a reason to cheer, friends, this is most definitely it. May we be resurrected people today, seeing ourselves as we really are: dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nText: 1 Corinthians 15:12-34, 2 Corinthians 4:7-18\n\nOne of my favorite songs of all time is Nicole C. Mullins’ “My Redeemer Lives.” I’ll blast that tune from my car speakers, roll my windows down, and scream the lyrics at the top of my lungs. (Okay, I’ll probably have the windows up. I’m the only resident of the greater Nashville area that can’t sing, so yes, I hide behind my windows.) Banging my steering wheel out of conviction, I’m sure I look like I’m singing along to some pop ballad after a bad date. But nope—just praisin’ Jesus!\n\nI sincerely love this song. It is a faithful reminder of the assurance we have in Christ: our Redeemer lives. Our faith isn’t based on some fleeting idea or passing trend, but on the conviction and confidence that our Savior conquered death and is alive today. \n\nOur faith hinges on the resurrection of Jesus Christ. If He has not risen from the dead, then He has not conquered death. If He hasn’t conquered death, then death still has power over our lives. Most importantly, if Christ hasn’t been raised, there is no resurrection for us—no hope after death and no eternity with Christ. “If we have put our hope in Christ for this life only, we should be pitied more than anyone” (1 Corinthians 15:19).\n\nBut the resurrection is real. Jesus did conquer death and rise from the grave. Our Redeemer lives!\n\nFriends, this is the great treasure Paul spoke of in 2 Corinthians 4—the “extraordinary power” which can only be from God Himself and not from us (v. 7). We carry Christ’s death and resurrection in us—the power of His atonement and the glory of His resurrected life (v. 10). No matter what life brings, our hope is secure.\n\nIf I’m being honest, I don’t often treat the assurance of Christ’s resurrection like the treasure it truly is. Oh, I live like it’s valuable and worthy and excellent, but the greatest treasure? Sadly, not so much. Instead, I run around, spending my time like this life on earth is the only one I’ve got. I become easily distracted by what I think I need right now.\n\nBut this life and the things of this world are temporary. They will fade. Our troubles, our pains, our afflictions—they, too, will fade. But our living Redeemer will never die, and His resurrection power will never fade. As Paul goes on to say, “Even though our outer person is being destroyed, our inner person is being renewed day by day” (2 Corinthians 4:16).\n\nIn Mere Christianity C.S. Lewis wrote, “a continual looking forward to the eternal world is not … a form of escapism or wishful thinking, but one of the things a Christian is meant to do.”\n\nWe’re meant to live like we know where we’ll spend eternity—because we do! We’re meant to live as though our inner life and resurrection through Jesus Christ is real, both now and for eternity, because it is! We live with confidence in this eternal hope because our Redeemer is indeed alive. He alone is our hope. \n\n“So if you have been raised with the Messiah, seek what is above, where the Messiah is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on what is above, not on what is on the earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with the Messiah in God. When the Messiah, who is your life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.” —Colossians 3:1-4\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: 1 Corinthians 15:35-49, 1 Corinthians 13:8-12\n\nIf you’ve ever stared at the giant map in the mall, you’re familiar with the red dot. Like a North Star for shoppers, the red dot shows you where you are in relation to the retail world orbiting around you. It has a singular, important message to deliver to cartographically-challenged shoppers like myself: you are here.\n\nThe red dot is not the destination. No one wants to stay at the red dot, but we need to know where we are in order to figure out how to get where we’re going. The same principle applies to our eternal destiny.\n\nIf that word “destiny” just caused a switch in your brain to flip to off, flip it back on. Like so many of God’s ideas, the concept of destiny has become distorted.\n\nForrest Gump said it this way: “I do not know if we each have a destiny, or if we are all just floating around accidental-like on the breeze.” But destiny is not some cosmic tailwind that keeps us from floating willy-nilly. It’s not what we’d see if we could look into a crystal ball. It’s not a future sprinkled with moondust by a fairy godmother.\n\nOur destiny is simply our destination. \n\nWhen we think of eternal life, we can’t help but see it through the lens of the temporal (1 Corinthians 15:35). We ask questions like:\n\nAm I going to look like this in heaven?\nWill people still be married to their spouses?\nWill children still know their parents?\nWill my pets be in heaven too?\n\nIt’s hard to wrap our flesh-covered minds around eternity. Since we don’t know exactly what life will be like there, we tend to fixate on what life is like here. We park at the red dot, to which Paul’s response is, Don’t be foolish! Where you are now is not where you’re headed (1 Corinthians 15:36-37, my paraphrase). Instead of being the final destination, our current circumstances work like the red dot to orient us toward our destiny. Paul breaks it down for us in verses 42-44.\n\nOur red dot is corruption, but that’s not where we’re heading.\nOur destiny is to be raised in bodies that can never decay (1 Corinthians 15:42).\n\nOur red dot is dishonor, but that’s not where we’re heading.\nOur destiny is to be given “the unfading crown of glory” (1 Corinthians 15:43, 1 Peter 5:4).\n\nOur red dot is weakness, but that’s not where we’re heading.\nOur destiny is to experience the same resurrection power that raised Christ from the grave (1 Corinthians 15:43, Philippians 3:10).\n\nOur red dot is a natural body, but that’s not where we are heading.\nOur destiny is to spend eternity in a spiritual body, finally set free from the limits and decay our bodies know this side of eternity (1 Corinthians 15:44).\n\nWhat a hopeful truth! The red dot isn’t the finish line—it’s just the beginning. All of the things that scream, “You are here!” at us today, are reminders that we are destined to end up somewhere unfathomably better.\n\nThe bodies we’re in now will someday be laid in the ground. But six feet under is not our destiny. God’s Word invites us to lift our eyes and look ahead because where we are now is not where we’re going!\n\n“For now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, as I am fully known.” -1 Corinthians 13:12\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nText: 1 Corinthians 15:50-58, Revelation 21:1-7\n\nHave you ever experienced a moment so good, so perfect and pure, that you wanted to freeze time? For me, those moments entail soft sand pressed between my toes, the hot sun hammering down, and the sound of the ocean roaring in the distance.\n\nMaybe for you, heaven here on earth is something else entirely, like watching your little ones sleep, or having the time of your life with close friends, or curling up by the fire with a good book. There are as many versions of paradise in this world as there are people living here. So it’s really no surprise, then, to see a million different renditions of heaven in everything from art and movies, to books and music, and even in our churches.\n\nGrasping the mystery of heaven is a challenge, especially when the things of God are too wonderful for us to understand (1 Corinthians 15:51, Psalm 139:6). Art helps us imagine a place we’ve not yet been. But without even realizing it, our view of heaven can be more informed by imagination and our own desires than the promises of God found in Scripture.\n\nThe season of Lent begins with Ash Wednesday, and for some believers, this includes a church service where ashes are rubbed across their foreheads in the sign of a cross, while these words are spoken over them: “From dust you came, and to dust you shall return” (Genesis 3:19). This act is a reminder of our mortality. But, lest you think Lent is a downer, remember this: the ashes are intentionally smeared in the sign of the cross—the promise of our own resurrection with Christ Jesus (Romans 6:5,8).\n\nEaster then becomes a celebration of His empty tomb and victory over death, as well as the pardoning of our sin and an eternal paradise spent with Jesus. But what will that promised eternity look like? The passages we read today give us a glimpse at three promises God makes about the new heaven and the new earth that are to come.\n\n1. We will be changed.\n\nIn Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians, he emphasizes that we will go from perishable to imperishable, mortal to immortal (1 Corinthians 15:53-54). While Jesus Himself was visibly changed after His resurrection, making it difficult for even His followers to recognize Him at first (John 20:15; Luke 24:13-5), some things remain the same. For instance, the scars a risen Jesus showed a doubting Thomas (John 20:27) indicate that marks of our lives here on earth might somehow exist even after resurrection.\n\nAs for our own resurrected bodies, Scripture promises us so much more than an ideal weight, a straighter nose, or shinier hair. We are promised resurrected bodies that will never decay—new bodies suited for new life (1 Corinthians 15:42-44).\n\n2. We will be freed.\n\nThe apostle John writes that in heaven there will be no death or pain or sorrow (Revelation 21:4). Eternity will be a place where we no longer hurt one another. There will be no more sad goodbyes and no more lists of regret. With no more sickness or hunger, we will be free from the pain that enslaves us here. And in the absence of these burdens, we will be filled with the fullness of joy (Psalm 16:11).\n\n3. We will be connected.\n\nJohn also tells us that God Himself will dwell with us in a way we’ve never experienced before (Revelation 21:3). He’s not just creating a perfect forever home for us—He plans to live there with us. We’ll never have to wonder if He hears our prayers because He’ll be more present in our eternal lives than we can imagine. No more feelings of distance or loneliness. In eternity, we will live in the constant face-to-face presence of our loving Father (Revelation 22:4).\n\nYou and I will never completely understand heaven in this life. But God gives us His Word, and we can read it and proclaim with glad hearts: “We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come” (The Nicene Creed). Thanks be to our good God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nI stood on the street corner this time last year, at the intersection of 5th and Main—head bowed, backpack on, tears streaming down my face.\n\nMinutes earlier I was walking from my car to my favorite coffee shop with plans for a productive Wednesday morning, when I noticed two priests up ahead of me (a site which would have been normal in my Chicago days, but was a first for me in little Franklin, Tennessee). The priests were from the Episcopal church about a block away. One was holding a small bowl of ashes from the burnt palms of the previous year’s Palm Sunday service, and the other held a small stack of papers in his hands. I greeted them and they greeted me, and they explained why they were there:\n\n“We know not everyone can make it to an early morning Ash Wednesday service, so we’re meeting them here, in the middle of their lives, because we believe that’s exactly where Jesus meets us.”\n\nThey asked me if they could pray for me. Yes, please do.\n\nOne priest gave me one of his papers and I followed along with an Ash Wednesday prayer on the page as he prayed it over me:\n\nAlmighty and everlasting God, you hate nothing you have made and forgive the sins of all who are penitent: Create and make in us new and contrite hearts, that we, worthily lamenting our sins and acknowledging our wickedness, may obtain of you, the God of all mercy, perfect remission and forgiveness; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.\n\nWe exchanged a few quiet words, then with his thumb he solemnly smudged an ashen cross on my forehead, saying, “Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.”\n\nI was stopped in my tracks. Tears flowed while traffic carried on in the background, and I stood in stillness with my God and wept for the sins that separated me from Christ.\n\nAt the age of 31, it was the first time I’d observed Ash Wednesday in this traditionally Roman Catholic way. What had once seemed ritualistic to this protestant girl became a vehicle the Holy Spirit used to bring me to repent and believe anew.\n\nThis is Lent. It’s a time to stop—wherever we’re going and whatever we’re coming from. Whether we’ve been anticipating this season since Christmas, or it’s stopping us cold on our way to where we think we need to be—here we are.\n\nLent is a pause button. It is a quiet unlike any other time of year. Lent is a season to close our eyes as the busy world buzzes around us, to consider those things we’d much rather forget: our sin and our humanity. We came from dust, and to dust we will return.\n\nHave you ever heard the phrase “suppressing alleluia”? I hadn’t until just this year. (See? We get to learn new things, even as adults!) It was a practice introduced somewhere around the 7th or 8th century where congregants would sing the liturgical “Alleluia” loudly on the day before Ash Wednesday, then put the joyful word aside until Easter. The suppression of “Alleluia” was thought to increase the anticipation of Easter Sunday and the excitement of proclaiming Christ’s resurrection from the dead. It’s another one of those rituals, like ashen crosses on our foreheads, that feels like a tangible act of an inward posture.\n\nLet’s be honest: rituals are attractive. We are people who love visuals and search for tangible acts that allow us to experience God. But what these rituals are not is measurable. Bearing ashes or avoiding words will not purge us of our sins. These acts alone will not draw us nearer to God. But oftentimes Church traditions—when we understand their origin and the intent behind them—can serve as tools to remind us of the very real reality of the Gospel in our lives.\n\nWhether you carry the ashen cross on your forehead or not, know that Ash Wednesday is for remembering our sin and humanity—for reflecting on our fallen state and our gaping need for a Savior. Let today stop you in your tracks to “lament and acknowledge your wickedness”, knowing that the King of Alleluias has already done all that needs to be done to grant you “perfect remission and forgiveness.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Joel 2:12-27, Jeremiah 24:4-7\n\n“Lord, even my repentance is broken. Help me.”\n\nThose are the words I scrawled in my notebook this morning as I tried desperately to lay my heart bare before God, frustrated that the process did not make me “feel” better. I am a sinner, and I know this. He is the one true God, and I know that, too. The lines of communication were open and I was trying to get there emotionally—wherever “there” is—but the warm fuzzies just weren’t coming.\n\nDo you ever have these moments where you fear you’ve forgotten how to pray—where you worry you’re not doing this whole “repent and believe” thing the right way?\n\nI went back to Scripture—to the passages we’re reading together today—and looked for the words “turn” and “return.” Maybe the answer was there—maybe I could learn how to come to Jesus all over again.\n\nI found the first “return” in Jeremiah 24:7, when God says of His people, “I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am Yahweh. They will be My people, and I will be their God because they will return to Me with all their heart.” Then in Joel 2:12, God says through the prophet, “turn to me with all your heart” and again just one verse later—“return to the Lord your God” (HCSB).\n\nAnd that was all.\n\nMuch to my dismay, the call to return to God is not written alongside a long list of to-do’s, an attainable checklist so I can feel sure I’m returning correctly. No, there is just one qualification—to return with all my heart. Evidently the cleaned up, feel-good part of my heart is not all God is looking for. He doesn’t want only the parts of my heart I’m willing to let others see—He wants the whole messy, confused, narcissistic, achy thing.\n\nSo, to recap: You and I and our whole unholy selves are called to turn fully, openly, and sans-covering to the holy, almighty God of all the universe.\n\n[Insert deep breath here.]\n\nIt’s no wonder we try to come to Him with layers of lies and pride and every other self-preservation instinct intact. It makes sense, right? Except it doesn’t… because Jesus.\n\nThe cross of Jesus is the path by which we return to our holy, gracious God. We need not fashion our own defense or disguise to shield our brokenness from His eyes—the blood of Jesus is our covering.\n\nOur actions do not give us the right to return. Our emotions do not grant us access to God. We return because—and only because—Jesus Christ goes before us, His cross as our banner and His grace as our plea.\n\nSisters, when you doubt that your whole, achy self is welcome in the presence of our God, look to the Cross.\n\nWhen you fear your return is lacking, that your repentance itself falls short, look to the Cross.\n\nThe Cross of Jesus is our only way to the Father—not just the first time, but every time.\n\nHis cross dispels each doubt;\nI bury in His tomb\nEach thought of unbelief and fear,\nEach lingering shade of gloom.\nI praise the God of grace;\nI trust His truth and might;\nHe calls me His, I call Him mine.\nMy God, my joy and light.\nfrom “Not What My Hands Have Done” \n-Horatius Bonar, 1861\n\n",

And even though I really have no business hauling my pregnant self out to walk on ice, I took my kids sledding this morning. And it was the worst! How do you guys do it? We were crying and falling down and fighting—by the time we left, I was done with winter. (But seriously, how do you guys do it?)\n\nI know why my kids fight and cry, and why I curse the seasons. We are sinners. On our own, we are diametrically opposed to the way of Christ and when given the chance to be selfish or selfless, we choose selfish every time.\n\nHonestly, it would be nice to skip over the hard parts of life: these cold, wintry seasons of hurt, anger, or loss. I just want to hide under my blankets and shut out the ugly and difficult parts of life. I don’t want to fight with the people I’m supposed to love!\n\nBut I’m so afraid that God uses bitter, icy times to reconcile us to Him. I’m scared that I have to go through the winter of the soul so I can enjoy the springtime of the soul.\n\nWhen I peek out from under the covers, I know the truth. I know I have to give up my own will, repent, and be reconciled to God, or I’ll never see springtime. I have to do more than hide and wait for winter to end; I have to allow God to change my heart.\n\nDuring the season of Lent, we try to give things up to train our raw fingers to let go of old ways. But to reconcile with God and to breathe in the springtime, we have to do more than just let go. We have to replace our icy vices with the good, warm things of God.\n\nI’m forever stuck in the winter of sin until I let go of myself and receive the good things of God. Christ is the best gift of God—He is worth more than anything we could ever give up.\n\nWe don’t make this happen. We just cry out for help, and our Savior thaws our bitter hearts. I don’t understand how it happens. But I believe that He is our only hope to free us from our sin.\n\nSpringtime is coming! Christ Himself is a real answer to the cold ache of our souls. It’s not an easy answer, but He is the answer that actually addresses the heart of my need. He is the relieving thaw of spring.\n\nThis lenten season, let’s do more than suspend our vices—let’s run to Christ. Let’s be brave, come out of hiding, and be reconciled to Him.\n\n“Yet whatever else it may be, Lent should never be morose – an annual ordeal during which we begrudgingly forgo a handful of pleasures. Instead, we ought to approach Lent as an opportunity, not a requirement. After all, it is meant to be the church’s springtime, a time when, out of the darkness of sin’s winter, a repentant, empowered people emerges.” –from Bread and Wine: Readings for Lent and Easter\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Debbie Eaton\n\nText: Mark 2:13-17, Matthew 4:1-11\n\nRecently, I was on my way to Palm Desert to speak. I struggle with anxiety when driving alone, and I was not looking forward to the drive. The abyss of grey asphalt, cement walls, and red taillights of stop-and-go traffic unsettle me, and I knew once I made it through that traffic the desolate, dry, and brown desert would surround me for miles.\n\nI get nervous to be alone. The stillness tempts me with voices that say I am not a good enough wife, mother, friend, leader.  I am haunted by the “what ifs” and  “should haves” and silence.\n\nI was driving through that desert, sensing the welling of anxious thoughts, when God came close and met me. As He gently shifted my focus off my self-imposed discouragement and onto His promises of acceptance, forgiveness, and love, the desert transformed before my eyes. The brown became a brilliant bronze, the blue sky glistening against the horizon. The cactus and Joshua trees reminded me that life emerges out of barren land, and the wind whipping up dust prompted me to know the Holy Spirit comforts and transforms our thoughts. The desolate desert came alive when God came close.\n\nThe Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. \n–Psalm 145:18\n\nLevi’s anxious view of the world changed the day Jesus called him to follow. Sinner, come as you are—broken, weary, shamed, and rejected. I see you, accept you, and will call you my friend. Come dine with me. What a beautiful invitation. I wonder if Levi’s world went from black and white to vibrant color that day.\n\nJesus extends an invitation to come close at any time and to follow Him, no matter our condition. He calls us to come close minute by minute, every day. He heals, He redeems, He saves, He invites, He accepts –He changes us and our perspective, which draws us into greater understanding that He cares about every detail of our life.\n\nThere will be desert days. Even Jesus endured seasons in the wilderness. In those seasons, He fasted and drew close to His heavenly Father. His physical weakness did not succumb to the Tempter’s plan because His Father nourished Him. The enemy has nothing of worth to offer a soul filled with the truth of God’s Word. Amen!\n\nFriend, the Word of God has the same power in your wilderness. Come close and fast with Jesus, cling to Him and His cross when the Tempter tries to steal your true identity. Like Levi who found his true identity in Christ, you are also invited, chosen, known, and loved—just as you are. As you come close to Jesus, the world around you will transform and become more beautiful and radiant because you are changed.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hebrews 12:3-13, Psalm 6:1-10\n\n“Self-denial is saying only: He goes ahead of us; hold fast to him.”–Dietrich Bonhoeffer\n\nWe, your She Reads Truth writers and friends, are learning as we go. I hope that’s okay to say out loud, because it’s true. We are learning about this beautiful book—the living Word of God—alongside you, opening it up each day and praying to the God who made us. We come to the Bible knowing and believing that the Holy Spirit has been given to us as our Helper, that He has been promised to us by the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Savior. This is who we are—like you, we are daughters of the King. We come empty-handed, expecting Him to give us all we need.\n\nIn preparing for this reading plan that spans the season of Lent (we like to call it “lententide” because it’s such a pretty word), we went to folks who know more than us for help. We called on pastors and friends, we read books and researched themes. It is part of our “job” and we LOVE it. So much. One resource we consulted was a book on the liturgical calendar called Eternity Today, and the author said this about Lent:\n\n“What can be lost in this season is that, though believers indeed ‘fast and pray,’ they often do this not more aware of the love of God, but assuming that they need to win God’s favor…\n\n“Lent is unique in the liturgical year because the members of the church conscientiously turn from excesses not to remind God of humanity, but to remind themselves of the constancy of God’s love.”\n\nI’m a sucker for all things old and liturgical. I love corporate readings in church services, sacraments and hymnals. I love studying Lent and just about anything else that reminds me I’m part of a body of believers who have been worshipping our God for hundreds and hundreds of years. But do I “do” Lent as obligation or to be a part of a centuries-old ritual? Do I do Lent to win God’s favor? I would never say so… but turning this quote and these Scriptures over in my heart and mind, I’m not so sure.\n\nIf I’m completely honest, I have to admit that I hope—or maybe even believe—my small sacrifices make God love me a little bit more. I hope they’ll erase some of those selfish things I did that I wish I could take back. I hope they’ll cover over my neglect of those in need, my lack of compassion for the hardships of others. If I’m honest, I think Lent buys me an ounce of forgiveness and favor in the eyes of God.\n\nHere’s the rub: this belief is not just a simple misunderstanding. It is itself a sinful pride that devalues the very blood of Christ. He has purchased my pardon! He is the righteousness that covers my sin! He is the One who has earned God’s favor, and He is the reason that favor is lavished on me.\n\nOur need for Jesus is deep, but His love for us is deeper. His love for us is constant, whatever season and state we’re in. He redeems us and refines us because of this great love, not because of what we do.\n\nWe come to Christ with empty buckets — whether we admit it or not. So let’s not bring our self improvements and call them sacrifices. Let’s don’t use our efforts as currency to buy the free grace we’ve been given.\n\nLet’s simply come to the cross of Christ — again, today.\nLet’s come empty.\nHe will fill us.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Matthew 6:5-34, Psalm 139:1-12\n\nI want to hug the person who invented name tags. Really, I think we’d be great friends.\n\nMeeting new people is such fanfare to some. There are mnemonic devices for remembering names, online guides to small talk, and the worst—the “get to know you” games.\n\nIcebreakers, often in the form of “the name game” or “two truths and a lie,” are usually well-intentioned attempts to make a group of strangers more comfortable with one another. They’re also my cue to run to the nearest exit.\n\nIt’s not because I’m shy—oh, goodness, no!-—it’s just that having 10 seconds to determine my forever impression on a bunch of people I’ve never met isn’t my definition of fun.\n\nMaybe it’s because the nicknames I’ve walked away with from these games have stayed with me longer than I’d hoped, or just because I’ve spent years talking myself out of the things I said in a moment of sheer panic (“Yes, I know I said I love to kayak, but in reality I’ve never been in one and I just couldn’t think of another word that began with the letter K”).\n\nMore likely, it’s because I want to control how the world sees me. I spend time bartering for my worth through the lens of another, and usually walk away counting my losses.\n\nWhile reading about the hypocrites in Matthew 6, I begin doing the same thing.\n\nNo, Lord. I’m not like that.\n\nAnd He gently pushes me to the end of the chapter, where Jesus teaches about worry, something that initially seems unrelated.\n\nBut when I can’t write others’ opinions of me, I get sweaty. When I try to manipulate approval, I become restless. And when I hustle to cover up my wrongs, I’m the most anxious girl in the room.\n\nIn that familiar, worried place kept secret by my shame, I find myself standing with the hypocrites as Jesus questions us—Why are you anxious, O you of little faith?\n\nI want to point to the part of my name tag that says “Christian” in bold letters. Of course I have faith!\n\nHe reminds me to soften my strife and silence my sales pitch. Am I afraid the Christian life will go unnoticed, or am I worried I won’t get credit for being a part of it?\n\nIf we really looked to see what’s behind and before our random acts of kindness, behind and before our words formed in prayer, behind and before our songs sung in worship—would there be a void?\n\nThose actions have a name and it’s not ours.\n\nMay I be willing to trade a whisper of my name for a shout of His.\nMay I stop trying to be the “bigger person” and start seeking the All Sufficient.\nMay I replace my performance with His presence.\nMay we come quietly for the Almighty to sound.\n\n“Father, you know us in secret, and you know all our secret places.\nWhat we do to benefit your kingdom will not be lost if it is not seen by others,\nfor you see and you reward according to your grace and mercy.\nStrengthen us to do good works, visibly or invisibly, always in your name.” \n-GK Chesterton\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Come in Mercy",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Diana Stone\n\nText: Isaiah 58:1-14\n\nLast year was my first time observing Lent, a season I’d known next to nothing about prior to that. I was caught up in the whirlwind of its beauty, especially online. It seemed everyone was giving up something they leaned on in day to day life. Coffee and chocolate were especially mourned, but I decided that without coffee I may not make it through Lent at all.\n\nBeautiful journals, study guides, books, and prints filled my social media. I was blown away by the fervor for this time in the life of the Church, yet in each purchase and choice that I made, something felt wrong.\n\nWhy did Lent seem like it was all about me?\n\nMaybe you’re feeling the same things this year. Maybe you decided not to do anything because your ideas felt shallow compared to the Easter story we’re preparing for. Maybe, like me, your heart needs to be reminded that this season is not about our holy acts or intentions, but the love and mercy of our Holy God.\n\nPart of walking deeper in our journey with Christ is learning to turn our inward focus outward—taking our gaze off ourselves and onto Christ, and onto others for the sake of Christ. Let’s take a moment today to explore what “giving up something for Lent” might look like in light of God’s Word and the “chosen fast” He calls us to in Isaiah 58.\n\nWhat if we thought about:\n\nGiving up evil practices (Judges 2:19).\nGiving up violence and oppression (Ezekiel 45:9).\nGiving up religious compromise (Daniel 3:28).\nGiving up possessions (Luke 14:33).\nGiving up words that tear others down (Ephesians 4:29).\n\nI want to encourage you to read these Scriptures—and others!— and listen to the Holy Spirit. Where is He nudging your heart this Lent season and beyond—to shift your gaze outward onto Christ and His Church?\n\nWould you give up your Instagram feed being solely dedicated to your life to include causes that burden your heart? Would you give up a grudge or ill-thoughts toward a friend and devote time to praying for her each day? Would you be willing to give up complacency and take a stand for your faith in a place you may not be comfortable, whether online or off, for the sake of the lost and the glory of God? Where can you extend God’s mercy to others right here where He has placed you?\n\nWhatever this Lent season looks like for you—from devoting time to writing in a journal, to reading your children a Bible story each night—let’s allow the season to reflect the heart of the Father, the reason we prepare our souls for the sacrifice and celebration to come. We can never come close to what Jesus gave up for us, but we can draw ourselves close to Him.\n\nIsn’t the fast I choose:\n\nTo break the chains of wickedness,\nto untie the ropes of the yoke,\nto set the oppressed free,\nand to tear off every yoke?\n\nIs it not to share your bread with the hungry,\nto bring the poor and homeless into your house,\nto clothe the naked when you see him,\nand not to ignore your own flesh and blood?\n\nThen your light will appear like the dawn,\nand your recovery will come quickly.\nYour righteousness will go before you,\nand the Lord’s glory will be your rear guard.\nAt that time, when you call, the Lord will answer;\nwhen you cry out, He will say, ‘Here I am.’ \n-Isaiah 58:6-9a, HCSB\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Romans 12:1-2, John 4:24, Psalm 95:1-11\n\nAs I sit down to write to you girls today, I have a confession. As I crack my knuckles, take a swig of coffee, and strap on my noise cancelling headphones, I have to tell you: this is attempt #14 at focusing long enough to appropriately meditate on and respond to these rich and right scriptures for today’s devotional. Talk about last minute: I am literally writing this 10 hours before it is intended to go live on the site.\n\nMy focus is off and my distractions number in the hundreds right now, it seems. And I need to repent.\n\nOur family is preparing for a cross-town move at the end of next week and every utility company in the phone book requires applications and signatures and fees and phone calls. I’m getting texts from our builder asking “have you selected hooks for the mudroom yet?” and “it looks like you accidentally had some things delivered to a house that doesn’t belong to you yet.” I woke up no less than 4 times last night, working through details and decisions and checklists. (True story: two nights ago I actually dreamed I was taking a nap! That’s how exhausting these weeks have been—even in my sleep, I need more sleep.)\n\nWhen I woke this morning, my thoughts immediately went to troubleshooting furniture arrangements. My waking (and sleeping) hours have been heavily focused on a to-do list that is all-consuming.\n\nNow, there’s nothing innately wrong with a good to-do list—I’m not sure how I’d get anything done without them. But, I know the difference in my heart between managing tasks and throwing my mind, body, and spirit into something—and I know I’ve been fixing my whole heart on something that won’t last.\n\nHave you read today’s scriptures yet? I have to tell you, Romans 12:1-2 is sure proof in my life that God’s Word is “sharper than any two-edged sword… discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart” (Hebrews 4:12). Once I finally sat my bottom in my desk chair to study and pray today, I found myself reading it over and over again, checking it in various translations. And I repented for my heart that is too often “conformed” and not nearly enough “transformed.”\n\nI loved what I found in the Message translation:\n\n“So here’s what I want you to do, God helping you: Take your everyday, ordinary life—your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life—and place it before God as an offering. Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him. Don’t become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking. Instead, fix your attention on God. You’ll be changed from the inside out. Readily recognize what he wants from you, and quickly respond to it. Unlike the culture around you, always dragging you down to its level of immaturity, God brings the best out of you, develops well-formed maturity in you.”\n\nI confess my attention has been fixed elsewhere, and I think I’ve been missing a lot of God-cues and opportunities to love His people well. Not because graceless guilt tells me so, but because the Holy Spirit has been faithfully convicting me of this for days. It’s between Him and me. I only share this with you today because I think I’m not alone, and I want you to know that you’re not alone either.\n\nIf you find yourself so wrapped up in a project or life event that things of eternal significance are cast by the wayside, sit still a moment. Fix your attention on the eternal Savior. If you are having a hard time “readily recognizing what He wants from you”, return to Him in prayer. Let Him change you from the inside out. Our heavenly Father is full of grace and mercy, faithful to forgive and redeem—faithful to transform our too-easily-conformed hearts.\n\nAnd then comes my favorite part. We worship! We respond to the Creator and Redeemer with thanksgiving and adoration!\n\nWe confess and repent.\nHe forgives and transforms us.\nAnd we worship!\n\nWhether my eyes were fixed on Jesus this week or on boxes that need to be packed, whether my attention is on His unending grace or my need for uninterrupted internet service, He is faithfully transforming me from an earth-bolted girl to a woman with a renewed mind and spirit. And whatever your life looks like this week, He is doing the same in you. For that, let us say with the Psalmist, “Come, let us worship and bow down!”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Acts 3:19-21, Romans 2:3-4, Lamentations 1:16, 2 Corinthians 7:5-12\n\nRepent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out,\n\nthat times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord… –Acts 3:19-20a, ESV\n\n“It is not repentance that saves me; repentance is the sign that I realize what God has done in Christ Jesus.” –Oswald Chambers\n\nI’m an avoider. I avoid uncomfortable topics and decisions. I avoid unfortunate feelings and situations. I avoid watching the news when I can get away with it, and I’ve been known to avoid eye contact with the homeless vendor selling newspapers on the corner.\n\nI avoid grief and suffering because I don’t want to experience grief and I don’t want to experience suffering. I can’t solve them, can’t explain them away—I can only enter in, and most times I’d rather not. The only way to get to the other side of these unavoidable mountains is to walk through them—over, under, and around are not options.\n\nI avoid acknowledging my sin for the same reason. It’s uncomfortable, it’s painful, it’s something I can’t solve or explain away. I fall deathly short, just like we all do (Romans 3:23, 6:23). The darkness I am capable of is shocking to the senses. Who wants to admit such a thing? Like it’s the nightly news, I look away and wait for it to disappear. If I don’t see it, it must not exist.\n\nYou and I might be tempted to skip over this next book of the Bible we’ll read together for these same reasons. Some of the language in Lamentations is uncomfortable, the images are upsetting—it puts a magnifying glass up to a reality we’d rather ignore. Written in response to the capture and destruction of Jerusalem, the book of Lamentations is exactly what its name implies—it is a book of 5 poems, or songs, of lament. It is a book dedicated to mourning, weeping, and crying out to God. Some historians believe it may have even been used for worship within the actual ruins of the destroyed temple.\n\nOriginally named for the Hebrew word for “Alas!” or “How?”, Lamentations reads like an unedited exercise in how many ways a person can describe destruction, devastation, and despair. But the writer’s words don’t just apply to Jerusalem—they are a picture of our life without Christ. No comforter, no hope, no life—only death. Lamentations provides a revolting visual of the destruction our sin brings.  \n\nAcknowledging sin and its consequences is a difficult, achy, and emotionally invasive procedure. But a beautiful thing happens when we take that hard road through the mountain: we do not travel alone. Jesus is with us as God’s Word convicts our hearts. Jesus is with us as the Holy Spirit reveals our desperate need. Jesus is with us as our knees buckle at the devastation around us and the devastation within us. He is by our side to administer the salve of grace the moment each sin-wound is revealed.\n\nSomewhere in the thick of this ongoing heart surgery we begin to understand: only in seeing the depth of our sin can we see the unmatched grace and glory of the Cross.\n\nThink back to that image of God’s people standing among the temple ruins, singing out painful poems of lament. The holy city—their lives, their families, their futures—destroyed. Imagine them there in the wreckage, crying out to God asking all the appropriate questions. Why, Lord? Where are you, Lord? How long, O Lord? The first two chapters build like a musical crescendo, leading up to the climax placed purposefully, meaningfully in the center chapter of the book:\n\nBut this I call to mind,\nand therefore I have hope:\nThe steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;\nhis mercies never come to an end;\nthey are new every morning;\ngreat is your faithfulness.\n“The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,\n“therefore I will hope in him.” \n-Lamentations 3:21-24, ESV\n\nStanding there in the rubble, they worshiped. They repented. They claimed what they knew to be true — God is faithful, even here and even now.\n\nYou and I stand in the midst of wreckage today—broken churches, broken families, broken bodies, broken hopes. The consequences of sin are ugly and painful, and it hurts to look full at the darkness. We grieve our sinful state with honest questions and hot tears and loud lamenting—but this is the kind of godly grief that causes the apostle Paul to rejoice! Not because grief is painless or petty—it is anything but—but because godly grief leads to repentance (2 Cor. 7:9-10).\n\nFriends, we venture into the coming two weeks ready but not ready to face the sin in and among us. We take a somber step forward knowing only a bit of what is to come. But we walk ahead nonetheless because our Savior goes with us. Let us look on our sin, and let us look long at the Cross of Christ. Look to the One who does not avoid our suffering but enters in, who does not despise our brokenness but redeems it.\n\nMay our tears of grief lead us to repentance, and may we receive refreshment for our souls. Amen.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Lamentations 1:1-11, Psalm 51:1-6, Psalm 32:1-11\n\nLast week I saw my husband and my sister give me the same exasperated look. I knew I was driving both of them crazy. I don’t listen and I push for my own way. I know it. But instead of sticking around to hear it in so many words, I hid in my office seeking the comfort of Samoas and Miles Davis.\n\nI’m definitely spending my days looking for comfort: warm coffee, me time, a massage, a pedicure, even a hot bath. Our modern response to hard times is to look for physical comfort. If my soul is restless, I’m looking for my down comforter and Girl Scout cookies and sparkling grape juice.\n\nI know that a bubble bath isn’t going to wash my soul, but aren’t you tempted to do the same thing? I want to dip my chin in lavender bubbles and forget that the only way to be truly clean is through repentance. Psalm 32 says that blessedness is in repentance: “I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover my iniquity” (v.5). “Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered” (v.1).\n\nWe also scurry around trying to create life for ourselves through our super-fabulous accomplishments. I feel so much better when I’m a genius at work, a lovely wife, or the coolest mom. But does my life in the Kingdom actually have anything to do with my adorable talents? Our participation in the Kingdom of God is rooted in repentance, and all my busy actions and sacrifices are just that—business—unless my heart is willing to repent.\n\nI need to repent even of my righteousness. My actions do not earn my salvation. (Psalm 51)\n\nFinally, I seek life and comfort by defending, hiding and protecting myself. Is it your instinct to defend instead of repent when you encounter judgement? Years ago, when I was fresh out of college, I was accused of lying to my employer. Whether or not I’m a big liar is neither here nor there, but when I was brought before the big boss I sobbingly started to try to defend myself. He stopped me and told me I didn’t need to say a word in my own defense. He vouched for me, while I stood still and blew my nose on those rough brown paper napkins. That experience will stay with me forever—I don’t have to run to defend myself. Christ calls us to repentance, and He is our defender!\n\nAnd what freedom could possibly come from offering my own defense? True freedom is in forgiveness. Repentance gives true life even in the midst of judgment. We really have only two choices when we encounter judgment: harden our hearts, or repent. The author of Lamentations always runs to repentance.\n\nThis is why there is hope, even in the book of Lamentations. Sin has brought wreckage upon Jerusalem, though she was once great. Her people are hungry, and in their famine and their sorrow they call out to the Lord. Matthew Henry writes, “In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and entreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to make ourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lord for man’s transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows, lamentations, sickness, and death.”\n\nWe need to be washed from our sin, and only God can do that. It is in our calling out to Him, in acknowledging our sin, that we can enjoy the freedom in being washed clean from our transgressions. Hard-heartedness just leads to more judgement, but repentance leads to life.\n\nSo when I long for peace and spiritual cleansing, instead of reaching for my comfort in a latte and a good sugar scrub, I have to cry out, “Wash me, Lord!” (Psalm 51:2)\n\nRun to Him in repentance. Run to Him for peace. Because repentance gives life, and it’s a blessed sign of God’s grace and goodness.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Debbie Eaton\n\nText: Lamentations 1:12-22, Psalm 51:7-10\n\n“He that is jealous is not in love” – Saint Augustine\n\nWhat I am about to share is not something I am not proud of. As a matter of fact, it takes courage for me to even admit that a superficial struggle consumed me for years, challenging and endangering my relationship with my sister. It was only through my tears of repentance that God’s grace and forgiveness set me free… and set my sister free.\n\nI was so jealous of my sister. She is smart, tiny in stature, has an amazing husband and beautiful children. What I was most jealous of was her outward appearance. In my eyes she radiated outward beauty, the beauty seen on runways, in movies and magazines. Thin is in, and I despised going shopping with my sister as she picked out her size one while I sheepishly pulled double digits off the rack. It was so superficial, and yet the grip jealousy had on me was suffocating. It seeped into my envy of her two homes and her ability to have children. My sin was really ugly and blocked my ability to love her.\n\nThe jealousy seed took root when we were teenagers. Years later, the right conditions sprouted the destructive weeds of bitterness, distance, and a mean spirit. Like the writer of Lamentations, my sin had formed a yoke around my neck (Lam. 1:14) — my outward actions hurt my sister and my inward battle was torturous.\n\nGod was at work cleaning my prideful heart, exposing the raw places that were keeping me entangled in my own mess. He was renewing my spirit.\n\nCreate in me a clean heart, O God,\nAnd renew a right spirit within me. \n–Psalm 51:10, ESV\n\nEverything changed when my sister and her daughter visited for a week to help in the care of my newborn son. Each day she would disappear for hours on a run. I was left caring for my newborn and my six year old niece. This was not my idea of help. She felt distant, both physically and emotionally.\n\nWe went to lunch at one of my favorite cafés and I watched her push food around her plate, barely eating. I saw for the first time that my sister was weak, broken, unhealthy, and struggling with control because her life was out of control. Anorexia had gripped her.\n\n“Do you love yourself?” I asked.\n\nShe sat silently. “I’m not sure.”\n\n“Do you know God loves you?”\n\nSilence.\n\nOutwardly my sister was withering away and inwardly was frail. She was just like me.\n\nThe grip of jealously loosened and was replaced with an overwhelming sense of God’s compassion and love. God had to convict me of my sin before I could come alongside my sister and help point her to God’s unfailing love. She desperately needed Jesus and I shared.\n\nLeft alone, sin will strangle the life out of our heart and soul. It debilitates, destroys, and divides. The tighter the grip, the less we can breathe to sustain the inward and outward life.\n\nRepent and God will renew a right spirit within you. He will wash you whiter than snow. The triune God breathes life into our sin-gripped hearts, freeing us from sin’s bondage with His forgiveness that transforms us from the inside out.\n\n“But we cannot escape the embarrassment of standing stark naked before God. It is no use our trying to cover up like Adam and Eve in the garden. Our attempts at self-justification are as ineffectual as their fig-leaves. We have to acknowledge our nakedness, see the divine substitute wearing our filthy rags instead of us, and allow him to clothe us with his own righteousness.” –John Stott\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Cast Me Not Away",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Diana Stone\n\nText: Lamentations 2:1-11, Psalm 51:11-14\n\nThere’s a beautiful hymn by Keith Green based on Psalm 51:10-12 that I learned growing up. I liked the rhythm of it more than the words, and remember my mom—a song leader and pastor’s wife—humming it around the house when we were little.\n\nI’m an adult now, with a stronger faith than that little girl who sang “Create in Me a Clean Heart” in the hall. Still, the verse “Take not thy Holy Spirit from me” makes me stop short. Would He??\n\nThese passages we read today are Old Testament writings, a time when God directly interacted with His people through prophets and dreams and a burning bush. For one of them, whom our Lord inspired to write this Psalm, pleading to not be cast away from the Lord’s presence is a real and impactful prayer. Possession of the gift of the Holy Spirit was not a given—not a thing to be taken for granted.\n\nLike the Israelites, we are creatures of habit. We give our lives to Christ only to try to take them back again. We experience the true love of God, the redemption of our sins, but we are determined to come back in wallow in the mess of our own making—as if we don’t have a Savior. In the second chapter of Lamentations, we find the author continuing to grieve for Jerusalem, describing God’s wrath and sin’s effects on a people who have time and again disobeyed Him. Our Lord is Holy (Psalm 99)! He cannot be near sin; by His very nature He will not tolerate its presence. We cannot be reconciled to God apart from Jesus’ saving work on the Cross. Without Him, we are like the ruins of a destroyed city.\n\nWhat does this mean for us today—a broken humanity of hurting souls? It means we must return. Time and time again, amid the devastation and chaos of our wayward lives and deceitful hearts, we give ourselves back to the One who gives us life. We hand Him our ruins and receive His grace. We repent of our sins and ask again for His forgiveness—and Scripture promises He is faithful to give it (1 John 1:9).\n\nTake not your presence from me!, we cry. And because of Christ’s righteousness has been credited to us, He grants our request! The God of all mercy and all holiness draws His repentant children near and does not cast them away—this is the good news of the Gospel.\n\nI’m drawn to the words “reconciliation” and “forgiveness” time and time again in Scripture. God never stops offering them! Even in Lamentations, standing in the ruins, the writer’s words of hope seem to call out on our behalf (Lam. 3:55-57). God will rescue us from the depths of our pit if we only ask.\n\nBut we must ask. We must repent and receive the forgiveness our Savior has already secured. He won’t chase us down and chain us to his holy chariot — but He does extend His hand. He does pursue our hearts and offer us the sacred opportunity to follow Him.\n\nFollow or flee.\nTurn toward Him or turn away.\nReturn or reject.\n\nMay we return today and receive His love anew. Thank God He is faithful to give it.\n\n“…if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.” –2 Chronicles 7:14\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sarah Matheny\n\nAmong the many traits the girls in my family have acquired from their mama (enormously wild hair and enthusiastic thesaurus-reading not to be forgotten), is that fact that we possess some pretty sensitive souls. I mean, we feel all the feels. My mom likes to tell the story of how, at age four, I completely lost it because my dad gave me a goodnight kiss and did not equally place both his lips on top of both of my lips. I’m still reeling from the rejection. What that means in my current household, though, is that during any watching of children’s movies, insurance advertisements or yes, even game shows, my finger must be constantly poised on the remote control so I can power “off” when the offending purple minion, car accident dramatization or embarrassingly wrong Final Jeopardy response comes on screen.\n\nAdmittedly, when I read through these very dark, very sorrowful passages in Lamentations, I wish I had my finger on the remote control and could power “off.” The destruction, the groans, the torment—it is unbearable. And the author, once a matter-of-fact eyewitness, is tortured, his heart pouring out on the ground because of the devastation God has inflicted against a sinful people (Lamentations 2:11). In other words, he gives new meaning to “feeling all the feels.”\n\nBut isn’t that the point? How can we truly experience real repentance without sorrow?\n\nGod wants nothing less than broken spirits and contrite hearts when we come before Him for His forgiveness. Any ritualistic sacrifices, any well-crafted prayers, any flowery pleas for mercy—without being genuinely crushed by the true tragedy of our sins—are utterly and totally meaningless. God wants only your authentic expressions of repentance, no thesauruses required.\n\nGod doesn’t want us to just be “bummed out” by the consequences of sin in our lives and our world, He wants us to know what true, godly sorrow looks and feels like. He wants our hearts to break like His, and for us to gather up those messy hearts and bring them before Him laid bare, without pretentiously tying them up in a neat little package.\n\n“The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart…” (Psalm 51:17).  Nothing more. Nothing less.\n\nMy remote-control strategy of parenting has backfired into sleepless nights a time or two, with those last-seen images burning into little minds and re-entering them, unfortunately, right at bedtime. I quickly learned that I had to, somehow, help my children get through the hard parts of the narrative if they were ever going to see and appreciate how the story ends. I don’t want them to miss it.\n\nWe have a Father who loves each and every one of His children enough to break our hearts, so that our own story never actually ends at all, but lives on with Him for Eternity. Even though it costs us the anguish of standing in the midst of the ugly destruction of our own sin, it cost our God far more—the sacrifice of His own precious Son. He will bring beauty from the ashes—and more than anything, He doesn’t want you to miss it.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "But This I Call To Mind",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Lamentations 3:1-33, Psalm 32:1-2\n\n“My soul is bereft of peace.\nI have forgotten what happiness is;\nso I say, ‘My endurance has perished;\nso has my hope from the Lord.’”\n –Lamentations 3:17-18, ESV\n\n“I have forgotten what happiness is…” It sounds so dramatic, but I’ve had those moments and I bet you have, too. Moments get honestly low. Times get impossibly tough. Not one of us is exempt from the reality of grief, and I don’t doubt that every one of us sitting down together today can call to mind a moment when our endurance has threatened to perish.\n\nAs we read the words in Lamentations 3, different moments in my life flash into memory. I’ve never been attacked by a bear or shot at with an arrow, but I can certainly recall seasons of “grinding my teeth on gravel”, as the Lamentor so vividly puts it.\n\nJust the other day I sat down with my sister to talk about this passage and read it aloud with her, and after the second time through, something minor yet monumental stuck out to me. Do you see in verse 21—the moment the entire book of Lamentations climaxes—when the author’s sense of rejection by God shifts to confidence in Him? Pay attention to his words here:\n\n“But this I call to mind.”\n\nI missed it the first time and almost missed it the second, but it feels huge. The author of Lamentations (believed to be Jeremiah but no one knows for sure) doesn’t say, “But this is what I think is going to happen,” or even, “But this is what I wish would happen.” The turning point of Lamentations is not a moment of speculation.\n\nNo! He’s remembering something! Something he knows is true.\n\nThe Lamentor is calling to mind a truth he already knows, and it’s something that—in spite of the bears and arrows and rocks in his teeth—gives him a sure hope at the very moment his endurance is perishing:\n\n“The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;\nhis mercies never come to an end;\nthey are new every morning;\ngreat is your faithfulness.” \n–Lamentations 3:22-23, ESV\n\nHow does he know? What is this memory? Is it from his own personal life experience, or is he drawing from beyond his own life to his forefathers’ history with the Lord of Mercy?\n\nConsider how David drew from the testimony of his people in Psalm 22:4:\n\n“In you our fathers trusted;\nthey trusted, and you delivered them.\nTo you they cried and were rescued;\nin you they trusted and were not put to shame.”\n\nI think sometimes we forget God is bigger than what we know of Him from personal experience. That’s why it’s so important to learn about God in history and keep our own relationships with God personal, but not private!\n\nWhat if I found myself in a hopeless situation, but my only personal experience with God’s deliverance was that one time He helped me find my retainer in high school (yes, I wore a retainer in high school. ahem.), and the time our team miraculously won the volleyball state finals when we were down our best player? When I need to call to mind a steadfast love, I get to reach way farther back than 32 years!\n\nThe God and Creator of the universe has scripted an enormous and lovingly elaborate story of love and provision and salvation for His people. So, we, just like the Lamentor, get to “call to mind” the great deeds and marvelous rescues of our God over generations.\n\nYour God who sits with you today, while you are afraid and dying and bitter with heavy chains and a crooked path? He’s the God who slayed a giant with a stone in a slingshot, rebuilt Jerusalem’s wall and delivered an entire nation from slavery. Same God—then and now.\n\nSo THIS we call to mind: God has a track record of faithfulness and mercy that reaches back millennia, far before and beyond us! It is a record that, time and again, points to this truth which turns the book of Lamentations on its head and allows us to return from the darkest night to a light of hope:\n\n“Great is your faithfulness.”\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Diana Stone\n\nText: Lamentations 3:34-66, Psalm 32:3-5\n\nSustaining grace does not promise the absence of struggle but the presence of God. –Max Lucado\n\nLately I’ve filtered my conversations with God. Many of my moments with Him begin, “If You allow…, then I will…”  My vague threats quickly turn to silence for fear of what else my flawed heart might say.\n\nI recently learned that I’m pregnant. It’s my fourth pregnancy, our fifth child, and yet only one of our children lives on earth. This pregnancy was a surprise, but even more surprising have been the emotions I feel toward God right now. I’m a believer, but I find myself doubting. I know He loves me, but I find myself wondering. Like the writer of Lamentations, I’m standing in the wreckage of what could have been, but isn’t—and I’m questioning aloud if God is here.\n\n“If you let this child die, I will never forgive you. Never believe in you again. How can you claim you are sovereign if you continually let this happen to us?”\n\nSo my prayers are weak and unbelieving. Distant. Filtered. I avoid confessing my anger and my hurt. Will God punish me? Will He even care? I’ve always struggled with prayer, but now more than ever before. My own sinfulness delights in this withdrawal from God to near silence. Filtering my prayers and pleas, my hopes and fears, means allowing my human nature to take back over. Not bringing my true emotions into the light is just another way of delaying what I know I need to do.\n\nI need to repent. Even here in this moment— especially here. I am angry for the loss of my children, I am distraught at these blows to my faith, I am hurt that God did not rescue us from the storm that caused this wreckage. I am tempted to draw a line in the sand and say, “No. My faith in You can not go any further.” And though it is painful to say it all aloud, I know His love for me and my children is not threatened by any of these emotions. I know He hears me. And I know He is here.\n\nSo like the poet, I turn back to God with all of me—even the angry, confused and weary parts.\n\n“Let us search out and examine our ways,\nand turn back to the Lord.\nLet us lift up our hearts and our hands\nto God in heaven” \n–Lamentations 3:40-41\n\nSometimes, it’s just all we have left to wearily “lift our hearts and our hands to God in heaven.” We all are sinners, regardless of the circumstances we’re walking through. We live in a broken world where awful things happen, and we don’t get to choose what happens to us. But the choice we have is this: what we will do when we realize how much God loves us? Is faith truly faith if we set limits and issue demands? Do we love someone simply because they save me from the uncomfortable?\n\nDoes our Lord love us this way?\n\nPaul reminds us how to strengthen our faith and turn to God in times of trial:\n\n“…a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited. Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.’” –2 Corinthians 12: 7-9\n\nPaul pleads with the Lord. He keeps bringing his pain back to God—not hiding it from Him—so that God can administer grace once more.\n\nOur God sovereignly waits for me to return to Him with my brokenness, just like He waits for you. I don’t have to waste away in silence. I don’t need to draw lines, set boundaries, or attempt to control any outcome. I need to repent of these things, allowing the Holy Spirit to bend my will to the Lord’s. Knowing my Savior also suffered, I accept His perfect “grace upon grace” in the midst of the chaos and confusion we will all experience.\n\nOur pain and our emotions are real, but so is our God. His grace is enough.\n\n“Prayer is the breath of the new man, drawing in the air of mercy in petitions, and returning it in praises; it proves and maintains the spiritual life.” –Matthew Henry\n\n",

    "devo_title": "When You May Be Found",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Lamentations 4:1-11, Psalm 32:6-7\n\nI confess I’m easily, daily, hourly tricked by the exterior of a person — what they look like, where they live, what they do with their days, even how the world classifies them in terms of wealth and status and ethnicity and name. I confess I believe the lie that those things matter; I confess I have to remind myself of the person inside the person—the story and soul that make them who they are.\n\nI remember reading CS Lewis’s essay “The Weight of Glory” for the first time, how it gripped my heart and imagination with the truth that people are just souls with bodies. I say “just” like it’s no big deal, but the truth is, it’s a very big deal. The biggest, actually. The folks I drove past on the interstate today, them in their car and I in mine; the nice young man who handed me our dinner at the drive-thru window on the way home from a late day; the woman who listened as my son breathed deeply in and out as he sat on the table in the doctor’s office; the mom who walked out of that room with her own sick boy just before we walked in—they are each the creation of a loving God. They are each the soul Jesus died to save.\n\n“There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations—these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit—immortal horrors or everlasting splendors.” –CS Lewis, “The Weight of Glory”\n\nWhew. It’s heavy, right?\n\nBut Lewis is right. These false classifications and temporary circumstances I confess to idolizing can change in an instant—but I hold them up nonetheless. I tend to judge myself just as harshly—What right do I have to my health and my home, my family and my job? And there I go, carrying false guilt around with my true guilt and wondering why it’s so hard to stand.\n\nLike the gold and the stones in this passage from Lamentations, all the shiny things eventually tarnish and all the strong things soon scatter—and if my hope for myself and others is found in anything but God, I am tossed around like a dry leaf in the wind. Like the lady Jerusalem, I stand in ruins, longing just for a place to hide.\n\nTherefore let everyone who is godly\noffer prayer to you at a time when you may be found;\nsurely in the rush of great waters,\nthey shall not reach him.\nYou are a hiding place for me;\nyou preserve me from trouble;\nyou surround me with shouts of deliverance. Selah \n–Psalm 32:6-7 ESV\n\nThe consequences of my sin are devastating, but more devastating still is my lack of repentance. Lack of repentance breeds shame, and shame whispers lies in my ear. Shame tells me I can’t be forgiven. Shame tells me I’m not worth forgiving. But the Cross tells a different story—the true story.\n\nJesus knew shame. The beloved hymn says it well:\n\nOn a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,\nThe emblem of suffering and shame;\nAnd I love that old cross where the dearest and best\nFor a world of lost sinners was slain.\n\nJesus endured my shame on the Cross, every last ounce. He endured yours, too. When I’m guilty of shaming others… when I’m guilty of shaming myself… when I am guilty of forgetting who He is, who I am in Him, and who YOU are in Him — His sacrifice covers it all.\n\nWill you seek Christ with me today just as you are, sin and all? Will you believe with me that He can be found? He is there on the Cross, with mercy enough for you and for me.\n\nMatthew Henry writes, “In a time of finding, when the heart is softened with grief, and burdened with guilt; when all human refuge fails; when no rest can be found to the troubled mind, then it is that God applies the healing balm by his Spirit.”\n\nMay our hearts be softened by grief and burdened with a godly guilt that leads to repentance. When all human refuge fails—and, by God’s grace, even before!—may we repent and look to the Cross.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Lamentations 4:12-22, Psalm 32:8-11\n\nI’m the worst athlete. But just to make sure, my parents made me try all of the sports when I was growing up. I was so excited to receive a basketball trophy in the 5th grade for being “the only player to not score any points.”\n\nIf I had to pick a sport I was the least terrible at, it would be competitive swimming. For a short season, I inhaled glorious chlorine fumes and flaunted a one-piece like a true athlete. I preferred long distance events because they require more endurance than technique and, unlike basketball, a majority of the swimmers were short, meaning I had a leg up on the competition. Literally.\n\nBut my favorite part about swimming was that I didn’t feel much pressure. Coaching takes place before the actual event and spectators lose interest after the first few laps, so my victories were small and my losses unnoticed.\n\nThe only person to see my every move was the lifeguard who sat in a tall plastic chair, overseeing the safety of the swimmers. His only job was to keep me from drowning or to blow his red whistle if I were to cross into someone else’s lane or, say, hit my head on a diving block. He was pretty quiet for the most part and I liked it that way. Between my flailing freestyle strokes and gasps for air, I never really noticed him.\n\nSomehow, and for a time much longer than my swimming career, I allowed this lifeguard mentality to frame my relationship with God.\n\nI’ll just keep doing my thing and you let me know if I’m out of line.\nSave me from tragedy and I’ll call on you when I need help.\nMeanwhile, my execution might be mediocre, but I’ve got this.\n\nWhen I read that God “sees” me, my rule-following tendency assumes it’s a warning, as if God’s blowing the same red whistle and saying, “I’m watching you. Behave.”\n\nI wish I could write a really endearing story about repentance, but the truth is, I’m still aiming for endurance, hoping to finish the race unnoticed. When I do ask God for forgiveness, it’s more a quick gasp of air to sustain me until the next time I feel guilty enough to swallow the reality of my sin.\n\nI become overwhelmed by the inadequacy of my sorriness, leading only to repentance for my lack of repentance. But then I’m stuck, drowning in weight of whispered words to God, face down in my transgressions, and that’s where I stay.\n\nI begin to believe repentance is more about my guilt than being freed from it.\n\nWhile I know God sees me, I don’t look for Him because I’d rather live in ignorance.\n\nI’d rather perceive God as an obligatory watch guard or stoic spectator than see Him grow and refine me. I choose surface apology and manufacture makeshift grace for myself.\n\nAnd Lord, I don’t want to any longer.\nYou are well-versed in the depth of my fears.\nYou are mindful of my faintest joys.\nYou don’t just see me; you see me through.\nMay the comfort of your gaze push me to bold, unashamed expression of my need for you.\nAmen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kelsey King\n\nText:  Lamentations 5:1-22, Isaiah 55:1-13\n\nBack in the day, in the glory of middle school, I was a cheerleader. It was a short-lived phase, really, but little 13-year old Kels was all about the poms. There’s a chance I have since burned the pictures to prove it, but even nine years later, ask me to cheer on the Chantilly Chargers and I’ve got it on lock.\n\nThe name of the sport speaks for itself. Cheerleaders are to be the leaders of cheer—the ones who pump up both the players and the crowd, faithfully standing on the sidelines as a symbol of support for those in the trenches of the game.\n\nThis is the thing: though I still have the flippy skirt from my days of cheerleading yore, I’m not always a cheerleader— of my people, of their successes, of their joys, or of their victories. Sometimes, and perhaps even often, I am cynical and critical. I mask it as being “realistic,” but that is really just a shoddy attempt to loosen myself from the call to encourage and build up.\n\nIf I’m being honest, and this seems like both a safe and terrifying place to do so, my lack of cheering on my people can be linked back to some level of jealousy, insecurity, or fear of not measuring up. Often a combination of all three. Instead of rejoicing alongside my brothers and sisters, my train of thought can sometimes read like this:\n\nI should have gotten that job.\nI could have written that piece just as well.\nThat boy could have liked me too.\nI’m just as good a friend as she is.\nWhat I accomplished is more important.\n\nWhen I trace back these insecurities, I make a startling discovery: I’m afraid God’s economy is one of scarcity, and I believe there might not be enough of Him to go around. But Sisters, His economy is one of abundance! He pleads with us, “Come, everyone who thirsts!” (Isaiah 55:1, emphasis mine). Everyone. God is not stingy with His blessing—there is enough of His infinite goodness for all of us. Talent and creativity and joy and peace are wonderful—and truly they are gifts from God! But true restoration is not found in our success or another’s failure, but in reconciliation to the one true God.\n\nI might have traded in the sidelines for the stands when it comes to football, but God help me, I want to be marked by a posture of leading the cheers for my brothers and sisters in Christ as they run the race of faith. Instead of feigned excitement for their earthly accomplishments, I want a heart that sincerely roots for their eternal redemption. Rather than foster feelings of jealousy or competition, I want see my co-laborers in the Kingdom “go out in joy and be led forth in peace” (Isaiah 55:12).\n\nLord, like the writer of Lamentations, give me a heart that longs not just for my own renewal but the renewal of the people of God.\n\n“Restore us to yourself, O Lord, that we may be restored!” Amen.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Luke 9:43-45, 51-52, John 10:14-18\n\nWhen the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. -Luke 9:51, ESV\n\nMy in-laws live in Michigan. It’s a solid 9-hour drive from our house in Tennessee to enjoy their mild, midwestern summers and wonderland northern winters, but it is absolutely always worth it.\n\nWell, almost always. There is usually a moment—at about hour 7.5—where we’re past Cincinnati but still super far from Toledo and the kids have both used up all their charming travel puzzles and games, they’ve gotten whiney from too much screen time, and we’ve cut them off from snacks because snacks make them thirsty and drinks make them potty and we have made enough stops already forgoodnesssake.\n\nThat’s the moment when we front-seaters exchange exasperated-slash-desperate looks of “why did we think driving was a good idea?” and “couldn’t we have left the kids in Tennessee with friends and enjoyed a quiet drive just the two of us?” I’m pretty sure that wouldn’t go over very well with the grandparents.\n\nBut once we finally get there, we’re always so glad we came. We know it the moment we make that right turn onto their street to see Granddad and Groovy waving and grinning, with the pool all clean and heated and good things cooking in the oven. The being there always makes it worth it, but the getting there just about kills us.\n\nEnter my brilliant and blessed son, Oliver. I guess he was probably five at the time he invented the “Rocket Boost”, and it is now everyone’s favorite way to travel. The Rocket Boost is simple: close your eyes, force yourself to sleep, and next thing you know, you’ve completely slept through Kentucky! (Or Connecticut, or wherever it is you’re passing through.) Rocket Boosting is the best basic travel trick we know; even I have been known to sneak a Rocket Boost in the passenger seat from time to time!\n\nFriends, today we are doing a little Rocket Boost of our own. You may remember our Lent study is divided into three parts: Return, Repent, and Remember. We left you on Friday repenting and lamenting in 586 BC with the Israelites, worshiping and crying out amid the rubble of the destroyed Temple. Today we Rocket Boost about 600 years forward—past the Babylonian Exile, the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls under the leadership of Nehemiah, and 400 years of silence between the Old and New Testament—and when we open our eyes, we will see the in-the-flesh Promised Messiah prophesying of Himself, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (John 2:19).\n\nSo, let’s stretch our arms, sit up straight, and renew our focus on the road—it’s time to “Remember” the narrative of our Savior’s last days. Over the next 3 weeks we will follow the Son of God from the moment He sets His face to Jerusalem, to the time the New Holy Temple—the One the Israelites cried out for in Lamentations and the One who forever eliminated the need for a curtain of separation between us and God—is indeed raised again in three days, just as He said.\n\nAs we begin this time of remembrance with Jesus “setting His face to Jerusalem”, let’s acknowledge the gravity of this moment. Jesus was setting His sights on the place where He would die for sinners in accordance with the will of God. He knew what awaited Him. As John Piper put it, “Jerusalem meant one thing for Jesus: certain death.” Jesus set His face toward Jerusalem out of obedience to the Father and love for sinners—you and me.\n\nThe world was under a curse of death, and our only possible rescue required a Man who was both Offerer and Offering. He couldn’t come as an Offering only, served up by an angry crowd as He fought tooth and nail to escape, or doing everything in His power to avoid Jerusalem altogether. No—He had to be the Offerer as well. Jesus’ life was His to give, and in turning His face toward Jerusalem, He was setting into motion the final days of our Great Rescue.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText:  Matthew 6:9-13,  Isaiah 53:10-11,\n\nI have a notion that what seem our worst prayers may really be, in God’s eyes, our best…\n\nFor these, perhaps, being nearly all will, come from a deeper level than feeling. –CS Lewis, from Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer\n\nI can’t pray out loud without crying. I have no idea why this is or exactly when it started, but ask me to pray aloud – in front of one person or 100 – and there will be puddles in my eyes by the time we reach Amen.\n\nIf you’re thinking this makes me super holy, you’re totally right. [If we were texting, this is where I would insert one of those cry-laughing emoji guys. In other words, sarcasm alert.]\n\nBut I know me, and I know my auto-tears don’t mean what you might think they mean. I know how hard I struggle with prayer, how the concept of talking to God has always made me feel intimidated, disoriented, strange. I know how my tears are less often tears of belief and more often tears of “I believe, help my unbelief” (Mark 9:24). And while some days prayer flows like breath from my lips — Thank you and Please Lord and Help me — most days my prayers start more like a grocery list than a love letter. Here are the things I know I need. Here are the things I need to remember.  Here are the people I ought to pray for.\n\nIt’s no wonder I was relieved to read CS Lewis’ comment that “prayer is irksome.” Or, as my handy thesaurus might say, it’s frustrating. Exasperating. Disagreeable. Prayer doesn’t always come naturally. We were made for communion with our Heavenly Father—but so long as we are being sanctified here on earth, we’ll struggle with this tension of praying for a Kingdom that has come and is yet to come.\n\nJesus knows we’ll need help in prayer department when teaches His disciples how to pray, saying clearly, “Pray like this.” What follows, now known as The Lord’s Prayer, is not flowery or overly emotional. It is bold. Intentional. Concise.\n\nFather, Your name is holy.\nBring Your Kingdom, Lord.\nYour will be done, not mine.\nWe depend on You for our life, our everything.\nForgive us and help us to forgive.\nAll glory is Yours, forever. \nAmen.\n\n“Thy kingdom come.” Only Jesus could truly understand the weight of this simple prayer. Only He knows how difficult the act of prayer can truly be or what this Kingdom-to-come really looks like.\n\nYet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer… –Isaiah 53:10a, NIV\n\nJust as we saw in yesterday’s reading when Jesus “set His face to Jerusalem” knowing full well what it would mean, He also knew exactly what He was praying when He petitioned for God’s Kingdom to be ushered in. The coming of the Kingdom of God required the current, real-life sacrifice of God’s only Son.\n\nI want to pray those words like Jesus prayed — not because I feel like praying but because I know and believe in the goodness and holiness of the One to whom I pray.\n\n\u2022I want to give God glory in each and every thing, even when it hurts.\n\u2022 I want to desperately depend on God for my provision on the great days and the awful days.\n\u2022 I want to seek God’s will above my own, even when I don’t understand it.\n\u2022 I want to pray for God’s Kingdom to come — both in the Now and in the Not Yet.\n\n“The petition, then,” says Lewis, “is not merely that I may patiently suffer God’s will but also that I may vigorously do it. I must be an agent as well as a patient. I am asking that I may be enabled to do it. In the long run I am asking to be given ‘the same mind which was also in Christ’” (emphasis mine).\n\nOh, how I want the mind of Christ! Oh, how I long for my prayers to be worshipful breaths of obedience and my tears always sincere. I want to not just pray “Your kingdom come” but to seek to vigorously do it!\n\nI want to daily lay down the banner of my kingdom and pick up the banner of the Kingdom of God.\n\nFriends, in the spirit of praying for the coming of God’s Kingdom and the nearness of the Son (and because it’s Saint Patrick’s Day!), let’s close our time today praying these beautiful words from St. Patrick’s Breastplate:\n\nChrist be with me, Christ within me,\nChrist behind me, Christ before me,\nChrist beside me, Christ to win me,\nChrist to comfort and restore me.\nChrist beneath me, Christ above me,\nChrist in quiet, Christ in danger,\nChrist in hearts of all that love me,\nChrist in mouth of friend and stranger.\nMay it be so, Lord. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Luke 22:1-2, 7-30\n\nIt’s become a running joke in my family that my mother always gets skipped at communion. In our church we stand up, pew by pew, and file to the front to kneel at the communion rail. I don’t know how or why it happens, but almost always, the bread and cup are distributed to the person on my mom’s left, then almost immediately, to the person on her right. She’s left with the choice to either leave empty-handed or disruptively wave her arms, demanding the bread and cup.\n\nMost of the time, she sits quietly, questioning what she did wrong. Is it the way I held my hands? Was I supposed to say a certain prayer? Did I not make enough eye contact?\n\nIt’s just a fluke, of course, that the service plates somehow pass her by, but it makes for some pretty amazing lunch conversation.\n\nIsn’t it interesting how Jesus chose our faulty human hands to distribute a reminder of the perfection found in Him? And yet, the coordination of the Last Supper was anything but flawed.\n\nI love it when Jesus sends Peter and John to arrange the meal and they ask, “Where do you want us to prepare it?” I wonder if they expect to help Jesus brainstorm a place to hold the supper, or even anticipate offering to open their own homes. Little do they understand that this night has been set into motion from the beginning of time. The disciples think they’re the hosts, when they’re really the guests.\n\nFrom the man carrying the pitcher of water, to the guest room already set aside for the event—every detail was perfectly planned. But my favorite phrase in the whole passage is, “and they left and found everything just as He had told them.” Just yesterday, I opened my pantry to an entire bag of rotten avocados, so the concept of finding everything just as I expected is rather foreign to me.\n\nThe flawless coming together of the Last Supper isn’t a coincidence or even just a final miracle on Jesus’ last day. Look closely and you’ll see Jesus building the framework for countless times in the days ahead when the disciples would find things just as He had told them. Like the disciples, we hold this track record of our Lord’s faithful fulfillment of His promises close to our hearts, so when the time comes, like the hymn writer says, we’ll remember — although  “The Father turns His face away,” “The wounds which mar the chosen one bring many sons to glory.”\n\nJesus knew we would struggle to grasp the weight of His sacrifice and the fullness of His forgiveness.\n\nHe knew we’d be tempted to load that weight on our backs in an effort to re-do the work He’s already completed.\n\nHe knew, even then, we’d forget the depth of our need for Him and trick ourselves into believing our faulty hands are clean.\n\nSo, He spent the final hours before His arrest reminding us to remember by instituting a meal of remembrance—by instructing us to use the simple elements of bread and wine to remind us of His body and blood.\n\nAnother name for communion is the Holy Eucharist, which I love, because it comes from a Greek word meaning “thanksgiving.”\n\nAnd so, we remember His body broken. And we beg not to forget His blood spilled. And we give thanks, because “He who has promised us is faithful.” (Hebrews 10:23)\n\nFriends, we’ve been through some tough passages during the Lenten season, and revisiting the Crucifixion will be no different. Let’s fix our eyes on the framework of faithfulness Christ has laid before us. Approach in your hearts the table of thanksgiving established by our Savior, and find everything  just as He told us.\n\n“Bread of the world, in mercy broken,\nWine of the soul, in mercy shed,\nBy whom the words of life were spoken,\nAnd in whose death our sins are dead:\nLook on the heart by sorrow broken,\nLook on the tears by sinners shed;\nAnd by Thy feast to us the token\nThat by Thy grace our souls are fed.” \n—Reginald Heber\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sarah Matheny\n\nText: Isaiah 51:17, Luke 22:39-46\n\nWhile the image of Jesus hanging on the cross is truly agonizing, it is somehow the account of the Garden of Gethsemane that grieves me deepest. It is here, with Jesus on His hands and knees, weeping and pleading with God, that I feel the fullness of His humanity and the depth of His sacrifice. It is in this garden that I feel the weight of His suffering at my hands.\n\nHe made His way into the garden, away from the disciples, and He prayed, “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.” (Luke 22:42, NIV)\n\nIt’s hard for us to wrap our believing hearts around Jesus asking to be spared the Cross – the very purpose of His incarnation. But He puts an asterisk on His very human request by declaring His obedience at any cost.\n\nThroughout the Old Testament, “the cup” is used as a metaphor for God’s judgment and His wrath, as in Isaiah 51:17: “You have drunk the cup of the Lord’s fury. You have drunk the cup of terror, tipping out its last drops” (NIV). So when Jesus prays about avoiding the cup, He’s fully aware of what He is about to do by going to the cross: He is drinking the cup of God’s wrath. Yes, He’s taking on the physical agony of the cross, but He is also taking on the spiritual agony of separation from His loving father. And that separation is the pain that is breaking Him down in the garden.\n\nBut without missing a beat, He prays on.\n\n“Yet not my will, but yours be done.”\n\nAnd this is where I am convicted for all the times I complain about my own “suffering” in this life.\n\n“Yet not my will, but yours be done.”\n\nAnd this is where I am made keenly aware of my foolish attempts to build my own plans for my life.\n\n“Yet not my will, but yours be done.”\n\nAnd this is where I stop rushing through the Lenten season to get to the glorious celebration on Easter morning. The garden is where I pause to hear His sobs and His prayers. It’s where I see that cup we poured so violently spilling over. And it’s where I thank Him for His willingness to drink every last drop of it. For me.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellie Holcomb\n\nBetrayed. My stomach turns at the word. I remember vividly when someone I loved dearly and deeply turned into an enemy. There was a proverbial knife in my back and I was hurt, angry, and aching. I wonder how many of you have walked through betrayal. It is awful. You’re powerless to stop the pain and you keep wishing in vain that it could somehow be a different story.\n\nJesus wished it could be a different story, too. Just before this scene in Mark where He is betrayed by Judas and arrested, He was in a garden on his knees in deep distress, begging His Father to take the cup (Mark 14:35). Jesus knew what was coming and that it would feel unbearable. He’d asked His three dearest friends on earth to pray for Him, too—but three times, He comes to find them asleep. In His deepest hour of need, dreading what lies before Him, His friends can’t even keep their eyes open.\n\nI can’t imagine how lonely this must have felt. And yet, Jesus is not a victim, but a volunteer.\n\nIn the middle of a crowd armed with swords and clubs, in response to the excruciating task set before Him, Jesus says, “…the Scriptures must be fulfilled” (v.49).\n\nAnd even as He utters these words, “…everyone deserted him and fled” (v.50).

He suffered for us, so we could know that we never face betrayal or any sort of suffering alone. Emmanuel, God with us. Let’s take our pain, our breaking hearts, our anger, our questions, and all the things in life that make us feel powerless and helpless to Him today.\n\nHe was arrested so we could be set free.\nHe was deserted so we could know we’re never alone.\nHe was betrayed so we could be held in the arms of Love.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Mark 14:26-31, 66-72\n\nBefore I was married, I told myself I would never be unkind to my husband. Occasionally failing at that, I promised myself I would never holler at my children. When the children and the hollering came along, I vowed that I would try to eat fiber for breakfast.\n\nI was such a great wife, mom, and eater of fiber before I actually had to do those things. It’s like the way I felt about parenting before I was a parent — the judgy way I looked at a tantrum-throwing child sporting snow boots, a runny nose, and hair that was last brushed three days ago. I always thought, “I will NEVER parent like that!” Baby, was I surprised to have a husband, children, and unlimited breakfast cereal choices as an adult.\n\nWhen I read this story of Peter denying Christ, I see myself. I’m that loudmouth who would stand up and promise, “Lord, I would NEVER deny you!” Jesus was addressing them all, but Peter is the guy who is so sure he’s going to get it right that he argues with Jesus.\n\nAll the disciples hid and denied Christ in their own way that night. It felt like the world was ending. I’m sure they found all kinds of ways to justify their actions, just like I would have. Reading this story, it’s easy for me to say, “I, at least, would have stood with Jesus, unlike those cowardly disciples.” But, based on my track record of vow-keeping, I would probably have hid like greasy rat.\n\nFor crying out loud, what is wrong with me? In all my best intentions to do right, I fall away, again and again, and stinking again. Just like Peter, I psych myself up, “I won’t do it wrong this time. This time for sure!” But, in the end, I’m right there with Peter, listening to the rooster crow and holding my head in my hands.\n\nJesus knew this would happen. He knew His disciples we going to fail Him. He knew I would get parenting and marriage wrong, day after day. But this is why He came. This is exactly why He came.\n\nDon’t miss this moment to see your need for Him. It’s the first step of the gospel: just to see that you need Him. See it.\n\nWhen Jesus tells Peter he will deny Him three times, He’s not clanging the final bell of doom for Peter. He’s confronting Peter’s sin, but He’s not rejecting Peter’s salvation. We, like Peter,  must see the true nature of our sin, to see the truth of our salvation.\n\nWhen we see our sin and our need of Christ, our response must be like Peter’s—to weep bitterly for our betrayals, and to repent. Take your head in your hands and weep when you need to, then rise in repentance and walk in a new direction.\n\nJesus knows you, like He knew Peter. Despite all your adamant protestations that you’ll never deny Him again, Jesus knows your sin and He loves you still.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Psalm 22:1-26, Isaiah 53:1-3, Luke 22:63-65, John 19:1-5\n\nAny day now, I’m going to have a baby.\n\nBirth is one of those elemental moments in life: I’ll get to really yell and really cry. I love birth because I just can’t control it; I’ll go into labor when the time is right. One day soon I’ll be folding laundry, or lounging in a co-worker’s nice leather chair, and SOMETHING will HAPPEN—I’ll go into labor. Don’t you just love it with something happens?\n\nSo many days follow suit, one after another—but when something really happens we all stop and stare, or yell, or get out our phones to make videos. We really pay attention in these elemental moments of pain. Folks are always asking me to prophesy WHEN the baby will be born, and I keep dodging with, “I’m not going to miss it.” That’s just it. Some things in life are so big, and so intense, it’s not possible to miss them. When the baby comes, I won’t just sleep through it.\n\nIntense moments grab our face on both sides and force us to pay attention. In my moment of need, I will be center stage. My husband will rub my back, my facebook friends will pray for me, my church is already preparing casseroles for me, my doula will speak encouraging words, and my midwife will attend me like a queen. It’s true. These people who love me will drop everything and turn their faces to me.\n\nBut for Christ, in His moment of greatest intensity, when SOMETHING is really HAPPENING, we see that people are turning their faces away from Him.\n\nWe are painfully aware of the human side of Christ in these passages. He is in agony (Psalm 22), He is alone and isolated (Isaiah 53), He is mocked (Luke 22), and He is rejected (John 19).\n\nIn Jesus’ darkest moment, His best friends—those disciples who are like brothers to Him— deny and abandon Him. They look around for places to hide.\n\nThe law turns its back on Him. Pilate finds no reason to punish Him, but allows Him to be taken away in spite of justice.\n\nAnd finally, most painful of all, His Father turns away from Him.\n\nWhen Jesus feels the sharp crown of thorns pressed into His head, He is alone. At a time when we all should be there, lovingly attending Him, we turn our faces away. Although Jesus was 100% God, He was also 100% man, and this isolation was real for Him. Everyone He loved left Him to suffer the hardest moment of His earthly life alone.\n\nLet this moment grab you by the face. Yell if you have to. Turn your face towards our Lord and see the cost of our sin piled on His sacred head.\n\nO Sacred Head Now Wounded” by Ber­nard of Clair­vaux, 1153\n\nO sacred Head, now wounded, with grief and shame weighed down,\nNow scornfully surrounded with thorns, Thine only crown;\nO sacred Head, what glory, what bliss till now was Thine!\nYet, though despised and gory, I joy to call Thee mine.\nWhat Thou, my Lord, hast suffered, was all for sinners’ gain;\nMine, mine was the transgression, but Thine the deadly pain.\nLo, here I fall, my Savior! ’Tis I deserve Thy place;\nLook on me with Thy favor, vouchsafe to me Thy grace.\nWhat language shall I borrow to thank Thee, dearest friend,\nFor this Thy dying sorrow, Thy pity without end?\nO make me Thine forever, and should I fainting be,\nLord, let me never, never outlive my love to Thee.\n\n \n\n",

Don’t judge.\n\nAs someone who has read textbook after textbook of case law and learned the rights guaranteed by the Constitution backwards and forwards, the trial of Jesus has me shaking my head at how such a tragedy of justice could take place. Due process? Hardly.\n\nThe list of injustices is lengthy:\n\n\u2022 The trial was illegally held in a private home.\n\u2022 Witnesses were illegally called at night.\n\u2022 Jesus’ accusers “tried on” various charges until they found something, anything, on which Pilate had jurisdiction to rule.\n\u2022 When Pilate didn’t want to rule, he shipped Jesus off to another judge, Herod. Herod mishandled the defendant and let his jailers mistreat Him—dressing Him mockingly in an elegant robe—after which Herod returned Jesus back to the first judge.\n\nJesus had every right, every opportunity and, obviously, full capability to protest. When you are the Son of God, I would assume you are more than equipped to argue your case pro se—that is, on your own. And yet, He didn’t.\n\nThere’s a phrase that makes any attorney cringe when they hear their client say it. It’s like nails on a chalkboard, whether the client is technically on the right or wrong side of the law. That phrase is, “I don’t care what it costs; it’s a matter of principle.” When you hear those words you then know this case is out of your hands, because your client’s ego, pride and need to prove him or herself right is on the line. Nothing is going to stop them.\n\nI’d argue that no one is any more “in the right” than Jesus. Yet He endured every injustice, every step of the way, without ego, pride or the need to prove Himself. He let go of standing up for the principle of the matter by standing up for those that principally matter to Him. You. Me.\n\nAs pastor and writer Adrian Rogers explains, “If Jesus had taken up His own defense with the intention of refuting his accusers and proving his innocence, he would have won. But we would have lost, and we would be lost for all eternity.”\n\nJesus had a totally different case strategy—to take His case, and ours, to a higher Judge. He is the ultimate example of turning the other cheek. In those instances when we want to stomp our feet and cry, “No fair!”—or “But I’m the one who’s right here!”—we have the freedom to say nothing at all. Christ is our perfect defense. We can take our satisfaction not in proving ourselves right, but in the knowledge that our ultimate fate has already been sealed by a higher Judge—One who sits not on a bench with a gavel, but on a throne of clouds, wielding mercy and unending compassion. Case dismissed.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Luke 23:13-25, Isaiah 53:10-11\n\nSo when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?” –Matthew 27:17, NIV\n\nSunday mornings are the living worst at my house. There is no other day of the week that breeds more fighting, resentment, and tears for us. And I don’t mean the children. I am convinced my husband is a tyrant, rushing us all out of the house. I paused my writing just now to ask him to describe me on Sunday mornings. His whiskers bristled and he smiled, “Recalcitrant.” Then I had to get a dictionary, and I found this: “a person with an obstinately uncooperative attitude.” Fine, then, that’s me. We disagree about how to get our family of sixteen (might be just 6) out the door.\n\nThe thing is, Christ is the Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:23-28). It’s His rightful place. Caleb and I are both hugely inconvenienced that we are not lords of the Sabbath. It’s so much easier to make the wrong choices than actually submit my time and my life to Christ. I just like to choose me instead. But who in her right mind would choose someone—anyone—over Jesus?\n\nWhen Pilate proposes to release Jesus, the people cry out, “Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas!” Who is dirty Barabbas, and why is he even in this narrative?\n\nOk, so this blows my mind. First, his full name was “Jesus Barabbas.” Pilate is essentially asking the crowd, “Do you want Jesus Barabbas or Jesus, the Son of God?” There is an obvious parallel in the names.\n\nBut even more interestingly, the name “Barabbas” in Hebrew is “bar -abba”, or “son of the father.” So the full name of the murderer would have been “Jesus son of the father” (Matthew 27:17 NIV). When juxtaposed with the name of Christ “Jesus Son of the Father”, we can see that Barabbas’ appearance in this story is no accident.\n\nThe criminal’s name is an exact mirror of Christ’s name. The people get to make a choice between two “Jesus son of the fathers”—they could chose an innocent man accused of crimes, or a criminal to be released as an innocent man.\n\nIt was a clear-cut choice: choose the false man or the true man. Choose the innocent man or the murderer. But the crowd that day chose the wrong Jesus. They chose to call evil good and good evil. They chose Barabbas. It was the ultimate inversion of justice.\n\nWhy on earth did they choose Barabbas? It was tradition to let one prisoner go in honor of  Passover, and I reckon it felt pretty generous and righteous to set that prisoner free. And in this case, it seems so forgiving and merciful to let this obvious sinner go. Wildly, this was actually the more comfortable choice. Nevermind that they would all need to hide their wives and kids—they wouldn’t have to change their worldview.\n\nChoosing Barabbas didn’t force the crowd to face their own sin. They could go on living their comfortable lives if they got rid of Jesus. Admitting that Christ is the true Son of God changes everything. It changes how we spend every moment of every day. It feels so much easier to just pat myself on the back and choose Barabbas—”look, I set the prisoner free!”\n\nI’ve got to stop choosing Barabbas! I don’t want to live the false life; I want to stand in the truth! I don’t need to be lord of the sabbath; I acknowledge that Christ is Lord. I choose Him instead of me.\n\nWhere in your life do you say, “Give me Barabbas?” Where do we resent Christ’s rightful intrusion into the comfortable areas of our lives?\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Debbie Eaton\n\nText: Luke 23:26, Mark 15:21, Matthew 16:24-25\n\nI can’t begin to count how many times I’ve taken what feels like the weight of the world on my shoulders. I do this in every area of life, from trying to control a situation or set of circumstances—like the stress of household finances or my child’s grades and school performance—to taking on friends’ hardships, ministry burdens, work projects, even justice issues as problems for me to solve. But life doesn’t work that way, does it?\n\nWe were never meant to carry the weight of the world on our shoulders. It cripples and disappoints, creating discouragement, sleepless nights, and emotional turmoil. Heaping this weight on ourselves bears anger, resentment, fear, anxiety, stress, comparison, and jealousy—and that awful feeling that we can’t be everything to everyone, even though we try and try and try. I am tired and worn out just writing this!\n\nThis kind of heavy living is not the way of our Lord. Jesus said this:\n\n“Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.” –Matthew 11:28-30, NASB\n\nJesus knew we would live under the daily weight of our idols of self-entitlement and our illusions of control, trying to play savior to ourselves and others. He knew the burdens of life would have crushing effects, so He taught and challenged His disciples to follow His lead, practicing the disciplines that keep us in relationship with God.\n\nOn that Friday after being beaten, judged, and sentenced to death, Jesus walked the dusty road to His crucifixion. Simon of Cyrene experienced a divine interruption when he was pulled from the crowd to carry the cross. Jesus walked in front of him, and Simon kept his eyes on Jesus. He was not taking Jesus’ place; he was simply following Him.\n\nTo follow Jesus is to relinquish our attempts to be god and savior to others. It is trusting that God is in control and we are not. It is believing that Christ alone saves, and we, despite our best efforts, do not. It is accepting—and expecting—Jesus to interrupt your day to bring your focus back to Him. Friend, this is far easier to write than to live because it requires complete dependence, humility, trust in God and His Word. To be a disciple means having a heart to follow, learn from, and love Jesus as He teaches, directs, and shapes our character and response to life circumstances.\n\nWhen we fix our eyes on Jesus ….\n\nThe Bible becomes the sustaining nourishment for living life. (Psalm 1:1-2)\nInterruptions become divine appointments. (John 4:1-26)\nConfession turns to freedom. (Isaiah 1:18)\nQuiet time restores the unsettled soul. (Psalm 46:10)\nLoving one another is not fixing each other, but pointing to the Savior who heals, redeems, and forgives. (1 John 4:7-12, Hebrews 12:1-17)\n\nThe weight of life is transferred back to the only One who can bear the weight.\n\nAs we fix our eyes on Jesus, He will take on our heaviest burdens and use them to transform us to be more like Him, and others will see and witness His redemptive glory.\n\n“For it is the grace of Christ, and not our own virtue, that gives us the power to overcome the flesh and the world.” –Thomas a Kempis\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nGood morning, friends. Sundays at She Reads Truth are normally Weekly Truth days, where we as a community join in the important practice of memorizing scripture together. We do have a memory verse and lock screen for you today (it’s at the bottom of this post!), but we hope you’ll join us in reading the full passage in Matthew and reflecting on Christ’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem.\n\nText: Matthew 21:1-11, Revelation 7:9-12\n\nYou know what stinks about being human? Being human. We are limited creatures. We only know what we know. Sure, hindsight is 20/20, but when it comes to foresight, we can be blind as bats. We don’t know what’s on the next page until we get there to live it.\n\nPaul, in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, describes this as “seeing in a mirror dimly.” But, “when perfection comes,” Paul tells us we will see clearly—no longer linear, no longer partial, but complete!\n\nNow picture Jesus, both fully man and fully God, riding through the crowded street that day. He already saw the complete picture—beyond this Triumphal Entry—so He knew what this ride into the capital city really meant. He knew He was riding to His death at the hands of those who waved the palm branches that day.\n\nThe people cried “Hosanna”—a shout of adoration that was also the Hebrew word meaning “Oh, save now!” or “Please save!”.\n\nOnly Jesus knew the gravity of what the crowd was asking when they cried to Him, “Save us!”  And He rode on. He knew what had been and what was to come, and in love and obedience, He rode on.\n\nI wonder if, from His seat on that donkey, Jesus thought back to His mother Mary. She journeyed on a donkey, too, toward the most hope-filled moment the world has ever known. And here He was, riding toward the darkest moment in human history. Did He think back to her?\n\nOr maybe Jesus thought forward to that blessed day John describes in Revelation 7, when we will stand before Him in white robes as His Bride—all nations and tribes and colors and generations—waving palm branches once again, proclaiming that our salvation indeed comes from Him!\n\nWe don’t know; the Bible doesn’t tell us. He certainly knew all these things as He rode through the adoring crowds that day. And while it’s true we can’t know for sure what’s coming tomorrow or the next day the way Jesus can, we can confidently shout “Hosanna! Save us!” today, knowing He will and He did.\n\nHosanna in the highest! Salvation belongs to our God.  \n\nWe believe memorizing scripture is one of the best ways to carry the Word of our God with us wherever we go—to have God-breathed truth, instruction and reproof in our hearts and minds as we live unto Him each day.\n\nThis week we’ve chosen the crowd’s shout of worship and cry for salvation as Jesus rode into Jerusalem that Palm Sunday:\n\nBlessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest! –Matthew 21:9b, ESV\n\nWrite this verse down—copy it twenty time if that helps! Post it on your mirror or at your desk, in your car or on the fridge—anywhere you’ll see it often. Save the image below as your phone’s lock screen so you can read these words of truth throughout the day.\n\nWe want to be a community that is intentional about scripture memorization. Will you join us?\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Luke 23:27-31, Psalm 56:8, Hosea 10:1-8\n\nI’d like to nominate elevators as one of the most awkward spaces on the planet. You can go through most days refusing to acknowledge other people exist if you want to, but step onto an occupied elevator and you’re stuck. You know the other person is there. They know you know they’re there. You know they know you know they’re there. So you have 3 choices: stare straight ahead (awkward), stare at your phone (still pretty awkward), or look at the person (super awkward).\n\nMost of us choose Option A.\n\nJesus could have easily gotten away with ignoring the women crying out to Him as He walked along the dusty road, beaten and nearly naked, making the painful journey to an awful death. Yet even more remarkable than the fact that He brought His eyes up met theirs, or that He spoke to them in the midst of His suffering, is what He chose to say:\n\nTurning to them, Jesus said, ‘Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and your children.” (Luke 23:28, HCSB)\n\nJesus shifts the object of the their sympathy and mourning from Him back to themselves.\n\nWhy does He do this? Who are these women to whom the suffering Christ delivers a gentle but stern warning in the most striking of circumstances?\n\nThe women are noted to be citizens of Jerusalem, a center of religion that fervently rejected Jesus of Nazareth. We aren’t told exactly why they are following Jesus in a situation when many of His own have turned away. Perhaps they recognized glimpses of the divine in His words and actions and were following as unofficial disciples. Or maybe, and probably most likely, they were simply “good” religious folks who pitied Jesus and lamented the extreme cruelty being shown an innocent man.\n\nMore important than the motive behind their mourning are these three simple-yet-profound facts about their brief encounter with Christ:\n\nHe sees their tears. Jesus looks up from His own pain to acknowledge theirs. Yes, He was the divine Son of God suffering for the sin of humankind, and yes, they were members of that sinful race. Nevertheless, Jesus sees their tears, just like He sees mine and yours (Psalm 56:8).\n\nHe acknowledges their sorrow but redirects it to the proper place. Jesus quotes the words of the prophet Hosea when He describes the enormity of the sorrow to come for those who reject Him. In Hosea chapter 10, the people of God respond to fruitfulness and blessing not by turning toward God but turning toward themselves and their false gods. The consequences of this separation from God are severe—so severe that the people cry out for death to swallow them in their misery.\n\nJesus’ warning to the women on the Via Dolorosa that day was not an empty threat; it was the compassionate prophesy of a loving Savior who knows the natural way of a soul separated from the Father. I like commentator Matthew Henry’s explanation of Christ’s response when he says, “Let us weep, not for him (Jesus), but for our own sins, and the sins of our children, that were the cause of his death; and weep for fear (such were the tears here prescribed) of the miseries we shall bring upon ourselves, if we slight his love, and reject his grace.”\n\nBut Jesus does not leave the daughters of Jerusalem with a look and a warning that day. Which brings us to glorious #3—\n\nHe answers their grief with the ultimate display of love. The God who sees our every tear, who knows every hope and pain from whence they come, is the God who walked bruised and bleeding up the hill of obedience, called Calvary, and gave His very life to purchase our pardon. As NT Wright puts it, “The cross is the place where, and the means by which, God loved us to the uttermost.”\n\nThe God who views our tears as so precious that He keeps record of them in His book is the same God who says, “Don’t weep for me. Weep for yourselves.” For we are the sinful ones, Sisters, and He is all-holy. But through Christ’s work on the Cross, we are hidden in Him and brought eternally and indelibly near to God (Colossians 3:3). \n\nThanks be to God!\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Isaiah 53:4-6, Luke 23:33-38\n\nIn college, every older student I talked to gave me the same advice: whatever you do, don’t take Media Law. After a series of unfortunate events we’ll call “Requirements For Graduation,” I found myself gazing through my non-prescription lenses at my professor, who passionately spoke of famous court cases, the difference between slander and libel, and the details of his recent inner-ear surgery.\n\nIt was also in this class that I learned if I had kept up my childhood behavior, I’d basically be a criminal by now. (I’m now realizing that’s probably not something I want taken out of context. Let’s just keep that between me and you, ok? Ok.)\n\nYou see, I was on the fast track to breaking every copyright law in the book, which, yes, Dr. Collins, I read cover to cover. Growing up, I rewrote my favorite books to include myself in them. It wasn’t enough to feel like I knew a character; I needed the character to know me. I adjusted all of my favorite plotlines to include a spunky, curly-haired little girl who, of course, always had something to do with the happily ever after.\n\nMaybe you didn’t spend your childhood the same way, but I feel safe in saying that a good majority of us would jump at the opportunity to inject ourselves into our favorite stories.\n\nIn the simplest of terms, I came to faith the same way. I savored words of Truth for many years, but it wasn’t until I realized my name was already intertwined in The Gospel Story that I began to understand it. I’d figured I really was a sinner—by birth, inheritance, or association—but when I realized I’m an active sinner by trade, everything changed.\n\nI assume not many joyfully proclaim, “I’M A SINNER!!!,” in the middle of a school cafeteria, but I did, and I still remember the giddiness I felt upon being a part of the story.\n\nThe funny thing about this realization, as we’ve revisited during this Lenten season, is that my sinful nature is the very thing that should kick me out of the plotline for good. Instead, Jesus shows up, asking us to lean in a little closer and see how He’s written our own hearts into the story.\n\nLet’s settle in and take in the scene of today’s reading for a moment: two criminals have just been crucified, and Jesus is up next. It’s a climactic chain of events headed for the turning point, but then the focus shifts to the most unlikely of subjects— us.\n\n“Father, forgive them.”\n\n“Father, forgive [your name goes here].”\n\nAnd here’s where the story twists unlike any I could have written for myself. Honestly, I’m tempted to take my forgiveness and run for the hills, because things are getting intense and I’m afraid the casting of my role is a mistake.\n\nBut friends, we weren’t written out of the story. We’re still front and center.\n\nLike John MacArthur points out, “The forgiveness [Jesus] extended on the cross to those who put him to death is the same forgiveness he extends to sinners today.” His grace is specific for you and specific for me. Being the object of Christ’s love is the biggest role we’ll ever play—a role of a deep recognition and intimate knowledge, created by our Heavenly Father for us to fill. It isn’t until we view the story from our assigned places that we allow ourselves to see His forgiveness as a gift of personalized mercy.\n\nBecause of the sacrifice of the Son and the forgiveness of the Father, you and I have a place in this story—in The Story. May we continue to walk in the narrative of grace penned with us in mind.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Luke 23:32-33, 39-43, Mark 15:27-32, Isaiah 53:12\n\nIt’s become a standard part of my day now. Every afternoon, around 5:15, I take my place in the slow-moving right hand lane of I-65 North, and I repent.\n\nThe She Reads Truth office is a solid 50-minute drive from my house in light traffic, so on the way home it’s a totally different monster. There’s a section of road on 65 North, a mile or so preceding the exits to the 440 bypass, where I am daily and rather begrudgingly reminded I’m a sinner. It’s like God gives me a glimpse, via Nashville’s going-home traffic, of the filthy soot of sin that lines the edges of my heart like a chimney. I’m a new woman in Christ, God’s Word says (2 Cor. 5:17), but there’s still plenty of the “old woman” tendencies sticking around to cause a ruckus.\n\nIt’s not a road rage thing; it’s much more subtle for me. I sit in my white minivan, with my satellite radio and calm demeanor, letting the occasional driver from the lane left of mine squeeze in front of me. And in my head, I silently make two lists of people: the Nice Ones, those who get into the far right lane as early as possible to wait their turn for the I-440 East on-ramp, and the Rotten Ones, who take advantage of the lighter traffic in the left lanes to speed by us patient, orderly folk and then dart over in front of us at the last possible minute. I give an annoyed grumble and say condescending things to them in my head, while secretly wondering how much time this strategy shaves off their commute.\n\nAnd there’s the rub: I sin when I judge the Rotten Ones and think myself better than them. And I sin when I stay in the left lane longer than I ought, playing innocent when I’m the one needing to sneak a notch or two to the right. I sin when I’m convinced my schedule is more important than theirs, that these hundreds of humans traveling the interstate are just characters in my story instead of their own.\n\nI’m a sinner. A sinner who has a LOT of time to think on her drive home from work.\n\nWe do this, don’t we? We organize people into lists in our head—who’s kind and who’s not, who’s selfless and who’s selfish, who’s a hard worker and who’s lazy, who we’d like to hang out with and who we’d like to avoid.\n\nWhen it comes to who among us is entitled to God’s love, we’re all on the Not Worthy list.\n\nThe Worthy list is made up of only one name: Jesus.\n\nAnd it would stay this way forever, were it not for the Cross.\n\nThe Cross is the sacred place where Jesus—Son of God, Worthy Lamb, the Sinless One—is “numbered with the transgressors.” He is placed on the list of those deserving God’s holy wrath, taking the death due their sin— our sin. Christ becomes our substitute, exchanging His righteousness for our sinfulness.\n\nBecause of Jesus—and only Jesus—we are forgiven, our unworthiness erased. Because of Him, we have have been made worthy, our names permanently placed on the list of those held forever close to our holy, loving God, never again to be separated from Him.\n\nWhether you’ve been in the lane of faith and repentance for miles or you squeezed over at the last minute, God’s grace is effective for you.\n\nYou, daughter of God who puts her trust in Jesus—your name is on the Worthy list. And it cannot, will not be erased.\n\n“Who can be afraid of one who is written in the same list with us? Surely we may come boldly to Him, and confess our guilt. He who is numbered with us cannot condemn us. Was He not put down in the transgressor’s list that we might be written in the red roll of the saints? He was holy, and written among the holy; we were guilty, and numbered among the guilty; He transfers His name from yonder list to this black indictment, and our names are taken from the indictment and written in the roll of acceptance, for there is a complete transfer made between Jesus and His people. All our estate of misery and sin Jesus has taken; and all that Jesus has comes to us.” –C.H. Spurgeon\n\n ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Debbie Eaton\n\nText: Psalm 22:18, John 19:23-27\n\nI rarely find myself at the movies these days, but I was invited by some friends to go and see the new, updated Cinderella movie and loved it. It was fun to see all the little girls at the theater, dressed up in their beautiful blue gowns, dreaming of what it would be like to live the fairy tale. The scenery in the movie was beautiful, the costumes were stunning, and the story vividly illustrated the power of kindness, love, courage, and forgiveness.\n\nMost of us don’t live a fairy tale of ball gowns and glass slippers, but the broader storyline is one we can relate to. Our real life exposes the juxtaposition of cruelty and kindness, harshness and compassion, hate and love, good and evil.\n\nI can’t image the depth of emotion Jesus’ mother must have experienced, seeing her son— the Son of God—hanging in the balance of life and death. She watched as the four Roman soldiers mocked Jesus and divided up His outer garments, the seamless tunic she may have made with her own hands being raffled off. Death is hard enough to look upon, but to witness such horrible torture, mockery, betrayal, and hate is difficult to stomach or even imagine. Yet, in those moments of extreme suffering, Jesus models once again the power of love, forgiveness, and grace.\n\nThe soldiers concerned themselves with things that don’t last—His garments—missing the immense display of love happening right in front of them. While they cast lots for His belongings, Jesus spoke to His dear mother for the last time. He saw her grief, and before His last breath, He transferred her care to His beloved disciple and friend, John. Jesus’ love for His mother stood in contrast to the mockery of those who hated Him—a reminder that we are known, seen and loved by God, even in the most painful and humiliating of circumstances.\n\nWe tend to value material things in this life, things that threaten to bring out the worst in us. Like those Roman soldiers, we trust what is temporal, covering ourselves with false garments—pride, fear, even hatred—that harden and betray our hearts. These worldly concerns distract us from looking up to see the Father’s great display of love for us.\n\nSisters, let us cast away our false garments and put on His garments of grace, compassion, and love available to us through Christ’s work on the Cross. Only in Him will we find eternal peace, hope and joy.\n\n \n\n \n\n",

It is perhaps the most bittersweet day of the year, but somehow, in the darkness, the “sweetness” is harder to find.\n\nHave you read through today’s passages yet? If you haven’t, I’d love if you’d do that first. Today we’ll sit in three gospel accounts of Christ’s crucifixion. Allow your heart to enter the text and ask the Holy Spirit to quiet distractions as you give ear to this sacred narrative.\n\n.   .    .\n\nDo you feel the weight of what you just read? It’s hard to read without deep sighs and even tears, isn’t it? The reality of a real man—my God—enduring what He did. It makes me painfully uncomfortable. Yet, as I read these words, I’ve never felt so deeply loved.\n\nChrist’s final words came with His dying breath—”It is finished.” And it was.\n\nHe bore the wrath of the one, true, holy God against sin—wrath that was due to literally anyone and everyone but Him. And it was finally over. His death completed the work of salvation for His people. It was truly finished then, and it still is.\n\nIt is finished. Complete.\n\nAnd hear this today—really hear it: Because it is finished, there is nothing that any one of us can contribute to Jesus’ work on the Cross to bring us any closer to salvation.  \n\nLet’s worship the One who was wounded for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities. As we observe this holy day of sacrifice for salvation, let’s remember the chastisement that brought peace for you and me, and receive the healing that comes to us from the stripes He bore.\n\n“So then, as through one trespass there is condemnation for everyonem so also through one righteous act there is life-giving justification, for everyone. For just as through one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous.” -Romans 5:18,19, HCSB\n\nIt is finished, friends.\n\nThanks be to God.\n\n \n\n",
