    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nThere was a time when I was afraid to write. The act of etching my thoughts in ink onto a blank page felt like one of the riskiest things I could do—to declare who I am, reveal what’s inside of me, and then slide it across the table for the rest of the world to see. Even now as I type these words on my laptop in the comfort of home, I am prone to second guess every sentence, every word choice.\n\nSure, I like new beginnings in theory, but in practice they paralyze me. It might be a new calendar, an empty room, a first day, or a clean white sheet of paper staring back at me. Like a rookie film actor stumbling onto set, I’m certain I’ll flub the first take. \n\nBut Genesis is another story. It is the story—our story. The beginning of all beginnings, the book of Genesis is the true history of who we are and where we came from. The first book of the Bible, it is our first glimpse of God’s character in Scripture, of His creation and compassion and His covenant with mankind. And though, yes, we humans dove headlong into sin from the first, our faithful, holy, and steadfast Creator remains true. God is the author and star of this story, and He is the one who invites us in to make it our story as well. \n\nThe book of Genesis presents hard truths about human nature and the fallen world we live in, but it is ultimately a book of hope. God created us—each one of us—to bear His image, and He has not changed His mind (Genesis 1:27). Fear and fallenness plague us here on earth, but God will one day bring us home to the perfect peace of His presence. Until then, we are called to “be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it,” to extend God’s plan for Eden throughout the whole earth (v.28). \n\nOne day, we will know and experience our Creator’s presence face to face—in perfect peace, whole, and unashamed—just as Adam and Eve once did long ago (Genesis 1:25; Revelation 22:4). That is the life we were created for, the intimate relationship we were always meant to enjoy with Him. One day, even death itself will die, and we will get the fresh start we’ve always longed for—the perfect new beginning, free from fear. \n\nGenesis lays the foundation for everything else we read in Scripture. Our prayer is that this reading plan serves to draw you further into God’s Word, that it would bring you to a deeper knowledge of the God who made you and a deeper longing for His presence. He alone knows the end from the beginning, and we can rest in Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nWe have a painting in our home, one depicting a distraught Eve being comforted by a pregnant Mary, who is wiping away Eve’s tears. Her eyes focused on Mary’s belly, she reaches out to touch it, even as her own heel is trampling the serpent’s head (Romans 16:20). It’s an achingly beautiful, succinct depiction of what we lost in Eden, and of God’s never-ceasing pursuit to return us to right relationship with Him. \n\nGod’s pursuit of relationship with us is there from the start, in the beginning of His Word. From Genesis 1 and 2, we discover how God formed the earth and everything in it, including man and woman, who He made in His image (Genesis 1:27). He gives Adam and Eve the radical opportunity to rule over the world with Him, cultivating its growth. And out of His relational love for them, He gives them a choice about how they will live and work in this world: will they choose to follow God’s way and His wisdom and instruction for life, or will they choose a different kind of wisdom, one that relies on self-sufficiency and autonomy, apart from Him?\n\nGod has already provided Adam and Eve with everything they need to carry out this task, instructing them on what is good for them and what is not (“the tree of the knowledge of good and evil” [vv.16–17]). Prior to the serpent’s persuasive lie (3:4–5), enticing them to their own brand of knowledge, humanity dwelled in perfect harmony with God and one another. But after choosing to eat from the forbidden tree, “the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked” (3:7). From this point forward, discontent and shame would be a part of the human condition, disobedience would drive a wedge between creation and Creator. \n\nWhen God asked Adam and Eve where they were that day in Eden (3:9), He already knew, of course. It makes me think the question was certainly more for their sake than His—it had to be. He asks where we are, too, all the while knowing all the dark places we run to, the many ways we attempt to hide our hearts from Him. But He pursues us all the same, fully aware that while He will ultimately defeat the serpent, that same enemy still actively seeks to destroy us (John 10:10), to lure us away from the God who adores us.\n\nI looked at that painting again today. We’ve had it for maybe a decade, but to this day, if I look at it too long, it never fails to wake me to the indifference of my own sin, to the lie of self-sufficiency—it wrecks me. \n\nHonestly, that’s where I’m at today. What about you?\n\nIf God were to ask, “Where are you?”, what would you tell Him? Do you believe it’s safe to come out of hiding? Do you trust that our Creator knows what’s best for His own creation? The God of Genesis 1 and 2, is the same God here in chapter 3; He does not change (Hebrews 13:8). He is still in the business of covering our shame with His own righteousness—even when we disobey Him (Genesis 3:21; Romans 5:8,19). Wherever you are, He waits for you.\n\nKara Gause is a content editor for She Reads Truth, happily residing with her family in Nashville, Tennessee. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nMy children are currently in a difficult season of discipline. On a daily basis, usually multiple times a day, I dispense consequences for bad behavior, which are then met with responses of total shock and horror. \n\n“I didn’t do anything!”  “I didn’t know!”  “I didn’t hear you!”  “But his face ran into my fist!” \n\nLike generations of children before them—including myself!—my kids are gifted at playing the martyr. Rather than repent and ask forgiveness, they make excuses. And sometimes, they dig in their heels even deeper. \n\nHere in this story of the very first murder, we see where this blame-shifting began. And it all started very innocently. Two competitive brothers—one a farmer, one a shepherd—bring offerings to God. Cain brings the fruits of his soil, and Abel brings fat portions from the firstborn of his flock (Genesis 4:3–4). At first glance, it would appear that each brother brought what he had, but God does not see it this way. God looks with favor on Abel’s offering, but he withholds favor from Cain.\n\nWhy?\n\nIn their commentary on this passage, Tremper Longman and Scot McKnight explain the difference in their gifts: “Cain offered the ordinary and Abel the best, and of course the quality of their offering reflects the condition of their hearts. Abel is enthusiastic about worship, while Cain is basically disinterested.”\n\nCain is caught doing the bare minimum, but rather than humble himself, admit his spiritual apathy, and ask how he can do better, Cain digs in. He becomes angry. He throws a pity party. He nurses his bitterness until it culminates in murder, and even after all that he continues to play the victim: “My punishment is too great to bear” (v.13).\n\nIn these early chapters of Genesis, we are learning about the ways of God, but we are also learning about the ways of sin, and here we observe a major hallmark. Human sin is so utterly broken that it will even deny its brokenness. It will run, hide, make excuses, and lash out before taking responsibility and repenting, and this is an important thing to know about ourselves. When accountability comes our way, even if it comes harshly or imperfectly, our response determines the course of our lives. How we respond to sin sets our feet on one of two paths: back to God, or further away from Him. \n\nBut here is what else this story reminds us, and I hope this sets you free: sometimes we are the ones being confronted, but sometimes we are the ones doing the confronting. Sometimes, we bring truth to light and then, just like God does in this story, have to watch as a loved one hardens their heart all the more. This, we must remember, is not about us or our shortcomings or how we could have said it better. It’s about sin, and what it does to the human heart. \n\nThankfully, we have something that Cain didn’t have: the Holy Spirit. Through the gift of God’s Son, Jesus Christ, we have a helper and an advocate who is ready to work when repentance feels too hard. That is how good God is—even as He asks us to be faithful, He helps us to do it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nA couple years ago, God called my husband and me to something scary. Ike quit his secure church job with a regular salary and generous benefits to strike out and start a new church. We had no idea how it would turn out, whether we were adequately equipped, or whether it would succeed or fail. But we trusted God, so we obeyed and went. \n\nDuring that season, we relied on a number of stories in the Bible to buttress our faith. Whenever we needed a reminder about God’s gracious willingness to confirm a hard call, we read about Gideon. Whenever we needed to stand on God’s ability instead of our own, we read about Moses. And whenever we wrestled with the loneliness and fear of stepping into a seemingly illogical call, we read about Noah.\n\nNoah’s story is remarkable for two reasons, one which is obvious and one which is not. The obvious reason is Noah’s faithfulness in an unfaithful generation. Genesis 6:1–5 describes an era in human history that was so dark, so depraved, that it prompted God to declare “I regret that I made them” (v.7). The human race was unraveling, and yet there was Noah, “a righteous man, blameless among his contemporaries” (v.9), who managed to resist the moral current of his day. \n\nThis fact about Noah, on its own, makes him an exceptional person. But here is the less obvious, but equally remarkable truth about him: Noah was the first person recorded in Scripture to be asked to take a big leap of faith. To put it another way, Noah didn’t have the heroic stories of God to turn to that we do. No histories of God using the unlikely, or confirming a hard call, or rescuing a desperate people, or most importantly, sending a Savior. \n\nSo when God called Noah to something strange and nonsensical—building a boat, in the middle of the land, with no flood in sight—Noah had little to no record of God’s faithfulness in history. All he had was his own knowledge of God.\n\nBut how did he acquire it? \n\nGenesis 6:9 tells us that Noah “walked with God,” which is an intentionally active verb. He didn’t simply know God; he did life with God. He drew near to God, he followed God, he honored God, and he served God, and this was how he learned about God. He didn’t have a long historical record of the deeds of God, but he wrote one with his own life. \n\nMillenia later, as a people of God who possess generations of stories of God’s faithfulness to ordinary people, the witness of Noah reminds us of something important. As much as these stories are a gift and a help when faith is hard, one of the most important ways we know God’s character and get to know Him more intimately, is not simply by reading about Him. It’s through walking with Him. It’s through obedience. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nRecently, I met with someone who was agonizing over a big life decision. She wanted to make the right choice, and she was terrified of making the wrong one. But her fear was not simply about discerning God’s will. It was about disappointing God. Or worse, failing Him. If she made the wrong decision with the wrong motivation, she worried that God would punish her for it.\n\nThis is, not surprisingly, a common fear among Christians. Many followers of Jesus live with the unsettling worry that God will judge us for our sin, despite receiving His gift of grace and salvation. Either consciously or subconsciously, we operate out of a place of fear rather than love, and it’s often because of stories like Noah and the flood. \n\nThis fear of judgment would be understandable if the flood—or any judgment from God—were the end of the story, but thankfully, it is not. Instead, the flood is only a chapter in a bigger, redemptive plan.\n\nWhat we encounter in the chapters following the flood is a second story of creation. It’s as if God wipes the slate clean and begins again. In the same way God directed Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply, He commands Noah to do the same (Genesis 9:1). Noah is, in some sense, a new Adam. \n\nHowever, what is different from that first creation is the presence of sin. Humanity’s relationship with God has fundamentally changed, which makes this story fundamentally different. He explains what it means to be His people and what He expects of them, but He also promises never to rain down this kind of judgment again (v.11). \n\nGod calls these commands and His promise a “covenant,” which is significant. What God is offering is not a cold, legal “contract,” but a relational covenant that is instituted and upheld by God, and here is why all of this matters: In these opening chapters of Genesis, we are learning about who God is. God is just and He will not be mocked, and we see this in His judgments. But, God is also a rescuer and a redeemer who gives everything He has to deliver us. \n\nIn every story that follows, God affirms these two things: this covenant, and His commitment to preserve His people. And ultimately, He fulfills it in Christ. Jesus receives our judgment and achieves our redemption, and then makes this restoration available to all who enter this covenant through Him.\n\nThat is why we can read these stories of God’s wrath without fear. Sin has consequences and God is indeed just—but the judgment has been dispensed. Because of Christ, God looks upon us in all our weakness and mistakes, and promises, “Never again.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nMy dad is a talented woodworker, and one year he built my brother and me an elaborate treehouse in our backyard. It was the talk of the town. There was a fire escape pole, a sandbox, a gymnastics bar, and a slide. He built it so high it just fit within coding limits established by the California building department. While it may seem like his motivation was a defiance of building permits, it was really an extravagant gesture of love. He wanted our treehouse to be as big and awesome as a treehouse could be.\n\nIn Genesis 11, the motivation for building a really tall tower wasn’t quite as pure. After settling in Shinar, the people were afraid of being scattered throughout the earth (Genesis 11:2). Although God’s command to be fruitful and multiply implies expansion into surrounding lands, the people liked it right where they were. They didn’t want to leave and, instead, decided to construct a tower to “make a name” for themselves (v.4). They likely built a ziggurat—a temple that was supposed to bridge the gap between heaven and earth, a place where they believed they could communicate with the gods. This was a way for them to claim the territory as their own and, hopefully, avoid being scattered. \n\nIn contrast with this story, when Abram received God’s call of pilgrimage to a new land, he responded by building a stone altar (Genesis 12:1–7). Unlike the tower, this wasn’t a symbol of human achievement or possessiveness. It was an offering to the Lord. Although we find countless biblical characters building things—arks, walls, altars, towers—the inner motivation behind these outward acts is different in each case. Some are born out of self-protection. Others out of worship. \n\nIt’s so easy to become possessive, isn’t it? We find something we want, plant a flag in the ground, and we don’t let go. Understandably, we all long for something—a patch of land, a community, a reputation. But our desires can become all-consuming and corrupt when left unchecked. Suddenly, instead of surrendering those desires to God out of obedience, we fight tooth and nail to keep them. \n\nWhatever we’re building, may we work more from a desire to offer it all as worship to God than to protect our own self-interests.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nToday’s reading is packed with action: famine strikes, Pharaoh gets deceived, Abram is kicked out of Egypt. It’s the making of a great summer blockbuster. After Lot and Abram’s respective herdsmen begin quarrelling about their small quarters, Abram sets a boundary. In an attempt to maintain harmony, he gives Lot the hard truth and asks him to separate from the group and make his home elsewhere. “Isn’t the whole land before you?” Abram asks, perhaps with a sweeping gesture of his arm (Genesis 13:9). The surrounding plain of the Jordan River was lush and ready for the taking (v.10). \n\nAfter Lot gets himself in all sorts of trouble, Abram comes through and rescues him. I imagine he was a little agitated by his nephew’s actions, but it wasn’t in his nature to abandon him to his own folly. With the sweat and dirt of conquest still fresh on his clothes, he’s given bread and wine as the priest Melchizedek proclaims: “Abram is blessed by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth” (Genesis 14:19).\n\nWas Abram blessed by God because he was a victorious warrior? A protective uncle? Although, in this case, it may look like blessing is synonymous with circumstantial favor, we have to dig a little deeper. Abram isn’t necessarily blessed because He was delivered from his physical enemies. We know from other passages in Scripture that this predictable, cause-and-effect sort of way isn’t how God works. So, why does Melchizedek give him this blessing?\n\nThe second part of the message the priest brings is “blessed be God Most High who has handed over your enemies to you” (v.20). It appears that Abram isn’t the only one who is blessed—God is, too! Ultimately, God gets the glory for delivering Abram over to his enemies, and it’s His own power and blessing that covers Abram. \n\nJust as Abram was blessed by the God Most High, so are we. Our blessing isn’t dependent on releasing nephews from captivity (although I’d like to think we’d rise to the occasion), but just as Melchizedek came bearing bread and wine, Christ extends His own body and blood to us. When we accept His gift, we enter into abundant life. We are blessed not because of our own merit but simply because He blesses us. Today, let’s carry this story with us as a reminder that God is at work in our lives. Whether in physical circumstances or matters of the heart, He has called us blessed because we are first, and foremost, His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nIn his book, Beyond Words, Frederick Buechner says this: “Here is the world. Beautiful and terrible things will happen. Don’t be afraid.” Buechner is echoing Christ’s words in the Gospel of John, where we’re told to take heart because Christ has overcome the world (John 16:33). There are many times when personal loss makes it feel as if God has removed His provision, and sometimes it takes everything in me not to project the actions of others onto my faithful Father, who has proven His provision in the past. \n\nAlthough today’s passage records God’s covenant with Abram, I can’t help but notice the part Sarai plays in this story. First, she experiences the disappointment of infertility, fearing it to be God’s prevention of her potential family line. She takes action by asking her husband to sleep with their slave, Hagar, to produce an heir. “Perhaps through her, I can build a family,” she reasons (Genesis 16:2). So, not only must she endure her husband’s intimate relations with their slave, but she also grows to resent Hagar after the very thing she hoped for comes to pass—Hagar’s pregnancy. \n\nHer own infertility must have felt emphasized by Hagar’s growing body. I imagine Sarai looking at Hagar and thinking this new life should have her features, her hairline, her DNA. So, what did Sarai really want? Did she want Abram to push back against her plan? Go at it with God? As emotionally complicated as her situation was, in the end, it was only God’s plan that could ease the depth of Sarai’s distress.\n\nThere’s an eerie line in this passage after God reveals that Abram’s offspring will be as countless as the stars. It describes how, after the sun set, “a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the divided animals” (Genesis 15:17). After Abram sacrificed the animals that God requested, this strange apparition appeared. However, God’s presence was often associated with fiery images in the Old Testament, and according to the Faithlife Study Bible, that night “the passage of fire ratified the covenant.”\n\nThere’s a reason God often tells His followers not to be afraid. Famine and battles, new land ownership and elderly maternity, flaming objects that move on their own—these are not things you see every day. But these are the sort of plot twists God delights in using to develop trust in His people and further His kingdom. Still, He understood how alarming all this must have been for Abram and consoled him by saying, “Do not be afraid… I am your shield” (v.1). \n\nDo not be afraid, friends. God is our shield. Before taking matters into our own hands, let’s believe that God is for us, not against us. Let’s give Him the benefit of the doubt and wait for His redemptive movement in our lives (Romans 4:20).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nFour years ago, the university where I was working went through financial difficulties and laid off several recent full-time hires. I was one of them. It was devastating since our team was like a close family. After reestablishing financial stability, they extended an offer to come back one year later; and because I was juggling part-time gigs at the time, I accepted. Here’s the crazy thing: it was a far better role than before and wound up being the closest thing I’d ever had to a dream job. The experience led to one of those moments when you think: I sure wouldn’t want to go through that again, but I’m so happy things worked out the way they did. I couldn’t wait to share the good news with my family and, like Abram, say in amazement: “Is anything impossible for the LORD?” (Genesis 18:14). \n\nIn Genesis 18, both Abraham and Sarah laugh after the Lord says they’ll have a son in one year’s time. What a crazy claim! Being in their autumn years, how would they have the strength and endurance to raise a child? Abraham responds by laughing to himself and asking if a hundred-year-old man and ninety-year-old woman can have a baby (Genesis 17:17). It’s a legitimate question. But God isn’t even close to being done working the miraculous into Abraham’s story. \n\nGod came through for them. He gave them a son, demonstrating it had always been His intention to further their family line. And the story didn’t end there. God not only chose to make Abraham a father, but also the father of many nations and the root of Christ’s lineage (vv.4–5). It wasn’t about how tired or advanced in years the couple was now; it was about the kingdom. \n\nThe reason why it’s so important to remember how God worked for our good in the past is because it anchors our trust for the future. My story didn’t have to end with returning to that university, just like Abraham and Sarah’s story didn’t have to end with a male heir. God could shape us and build His kingdom in a million different ways. In the end, we’re left in awe and wonder, laughing and marveling, just like Abraham and Sarah. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nAs I read about the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, I couldn’t help but think of Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Toward the conclusion of the film adaptation, we see the Pelennor Fields lying in smoky ruins after battle. It’s a scene of utter and complete destruction. I remember watching this scene for the first time, wondering as the camera panned out if there’d be a familiar character still alive among the wreckage. I wanted to see a remnant of the good guys, to know that mercy had been shown to at least one person. Or hobbit. Or elf.\n\nMany of us hear words like “grace” and “mercy” and immediately jump to Jesus and the New Testament. But since we know that Christ is “the exact expression” of God’s nature (Hebrews 1:3), it won’t do to consider God in the Old Testament any less gracious or merciful.\n\nGod’s mercy is not hard to find in the Old Testament. It’s woven throughout the book of Genesis like a flowering vine, connecting the stories in Christ’s lineage. Even when people continue to make bad decisions that bring about their own demise or widespread catastrophe, God’s desire is for people to be saved (2 Peter 3:9). We see the ultimate display of God’s mercy in His Son, Jesus Christ; through the power of His resurrection, there is healing for the world (Isaiah 53:5). \n\nDuring his exchange with Abraham, God listens to Abraham’s plea and gives the people a chance. “The LORD said, ‘If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake’” (Genesis 18:26). They continue to talk, and that number of fifty is reduced to only ten (v.32). But sadly not even ten can be found. God still saves Lot—Abraham’s nephew and the familiar face Abraham knows and loves. God’s mercy is always there and greater than we expect, even when most people reject it.\n\nWithout Christ, it’s our own hearts that resemble that plain of smoking ruins. Even after receiving the Holy Spirit, we still wrestle with sin. We routinely choose to submit to our own will instead of the Spirit. Our sins may not seem as flagrant as those of Sodom and Gomorrah, but we are all sinners in need of grace. \n\nHallelujah! Christ has broken the curse of sin and death. Even now, Christ—the exact expression of the Old Testament God with whom Abraham bargained and pleaded for the lives of his community—invites us to accept the gift of eternal life. He is for us, and His mercy is greater than we think. Remembering this, may we echo Abraham’s plea for the redemption of our own hearts, our city, and our world. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nI’ve never been pregnant. I’ve come to terms with the fact that, like Sarah (or Rachel or Hannah) in the Bible, I have been given the burden of infertility, a weight that I’ve kicked and railed against and sobbed about and finally, dutifully picked up—mostly because I had no other option. I don’t know if I will ever have a child born from my own body, but I know that if I did, I would join right along with Sarah in laughing. \n\nGod’s timing is perfect, and sometimes, pretty funny too. To think, Sarah had waited her whole life to have children, and only once her family was in disarray, did God choose to follow through on His great promise. After everything that happened, why now? Because when she was at her weakest, once again, He showed His great strength.\n\nThe Bible is full of humans, not heroes. We see in Genesis chapter 20 a story of fear, when Abraham tries to hide and protect his wife Sarah by claiming that she was his sister, only to nearly cause a massive tidal wave of destruction for Abimelech. What follows in close succession is Sarah finally giving birth to the child God promised: Isaac.\n\nBut even amidst the laughter and celebration, a shadow hovers over this family. After all, they didn’t wait patiently for God to follow through on His promise. Earlier in their marriage, Sarah encouraged her husband to have an affair with Hagar in order to bear a child. Now, she can’t fully enjoy God’s faithfulness, because the proof of her unfaithfulness is right there, mocking her, at the party. \n\nAre we any different? When God is good to you, what do you focus on? Are you wholeheartedly clinging to His goodness, or do you still see, out of the corner of your eye, glimpses and reminders of your own sin, lack, and shame? After all, how good can He really be? We see the answer in the second half of chapter 21.\n\nEven when Sarah sends Hagar and Ishmael away in a fit of rage, God continues to be good to them. He is loving and saving and kind—because that is who He is. It doesn’t matter if you see yourself as a promised child or a child whose background is questionable. None of this is conditional on who we are or what we’ve done, but rather on who He is and what He accomplished on the cross. \n\nGod’s promises always come true. He has promised to forgive our sins and guide our hearts, leading wherever He pleases (Proverbs 21:1). He promises to give us everything we need for life and godliness (1 Peter 1:3). He promises to come for us, and not to leave us as orphans (John 14:!8). The Lord did for Sarah all that He had promised. The Lord will keep His promises to us as well. That is who He is. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nI really didn’t want to be assigned this passage. I’ve been a Christian most of my life, and still, when I read this passage about Isaac and Abraham walking up the mountain, I simply want to throw my Bible across the room. Why in the world would God ask Abraham to do this?\n\nThere are a host of things that God asks His people to do—things that, without faith and understanding of context surrounding these passages, seem really wild. Earlier in Genesis, God asked Abraham to circumcise every man in his household, even his servants. Today, Christians are asked to live in obedience to a lot of biblical commands which make no sense to the world and its culture today. We’re asked not to have sex outside of marriage. We’re asked to think of others as better than ourselves. We’re asked to go out of our way to give to and love others—even our enemies. These commands might seem obvious if you’ve been in church for a long time. But outside of the lens of faith, they really make no sense at all. Only God can give us the strength and faith needed to obey Him. \n\nAnd so, I’m left to believe that God must have given Abraham the strength and faith to obey even this—this seemingly insane command. Why would God have Abraham sacrifice this child, who he and Sarah had waited and longed for throughout the course of their lives? Why this child of the promise? If you remember Genesis chapter 21, you’ll recall that Abraham had just sent his other child, Ishmael, away. So now, if he were to go through with the sacrifice of Isaac, he would have no children at all. \n\nBut Abraham trusted God. He trusted that God was good. Abraham had learned that obedience to God brings greater blessing than pain. So, if God was asking him to surrender to something painful—something as horrific as losing his only son—then there must be an even more abundant blessing on the other side.\n\nI’m not sure I would have had the faith to walk up that mountain. But because Abraham obeyed, we now get to witness, through Scripture, the first example of substitutionary sacrifice, as God provides a ram in the thicket. Do you know who else walked up a mountain that led directly to an inconceivable sacrifice? Jesus.\n\nOnly when Jesus walked to Calvary, when the Roman guard slammed hammer into steel, through flesh, there was no ram in the thicket (Genesis 22:13). Jesus, the King of kings and Lord of lords, became God’s autobiography on earth. And God’s nature is not punitive—it is sacrificial. Jesus willingly obeyed the Father to the point of death—even to death on a cross (Philippians 2:8). And because of His supernatural, unexplainable, indescribable obedience, we now have peace with God. Thanks be to God for obedience and the peace that comes with it—things that we may not be able to understand, but can only pray to the strength and faith to emulate. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nIn 2009, I moved to Nashville to take a job at a middle school that had no central heat or air. That summer was hot, and I spent day after day in my new classroom, cleaning out closets stuffed with books, mice feces, and dust. By the end of my first week in a new city, I was exhausted, friendless and scared that I’d made a huge mistake in taking this job. \n\nThat weekend, a friend reached out and invited me to a concert with a group of friends. “This guy Patrick is planning it,” my friend told me. “Here’s his number.” Maybe I was desperate for new friends. Maybe all that time in an airless classroom made me bold. But I called, and a man with a deep, soothing voice answered the phone. Patrick and I talked for a long time. When we met later that night, I saw in his eyes something familiar and kind. Much to everyone’s surprise, we were engaged five months later. People thought we were crazy, and for the record, let me say this: we were.\n\nIsaac and Rebekah have an even crazier origin story. Camels, water troughs, long distances across foreign lands, prayers to God—all accumulated to create an arranged marriage between two people whose lives God would use to change the course of history. Their story is full of the kind of inexplicable coincidences that help us see God’s hand at work. I mean, what are the chances that Abraham’s servant would arrive at this well, at this hour? He asks her for water, and waits to see if this young woman will offer to quench the thirst of his camels as well. He’s searching for kindness, for goodness, for industrious character. And he finds it in Rebekah, the very first woman he meets.\n\nWhat are the chances?\n\nAs a Christian, I believe that God is constantly at work, guiding His people in the way they should go. Scripture tells us that “a person’s steps are established by the LORD,” and that “all [our] days were written in [His] book” (Psalm 37:23; 139:16). “We are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works which he prepared in advance for us to do” (Ephesians 2:10). These are comforting truths when things seem to be going our way, but not so much when our circumstances seem to go awry, veering off into an unexpected direction. But even then, God is our protector, who never sleeps or slumbers (Psalm 121:4). He is always engaged with our lives, whether we realize it or not. \n\nAnd so it was with Isaac and Rebekah. Their story reminds me that God builds unlikely families, restores broken relationships, and heals us from what seems irreparable apart from Him. He promised to build a family through Abraham and his descendants, a family line that would eventually lead to the Messiah, our Savior Jesus, who was born into this world to redeem His own Bride, the Church. \n\nAfter pursuing and finding a bride for Isaac, his servant “knelt low [and] worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD,” the God of Abraham (Genesis 24:48). Jesus Christ pursued His own Bride, even to the point of death on a cross. May our response be to turn to Him in worship, thanking Him for His faithful love and mercies that never end (Lamentations 3:22–23).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nWhen I was seven years old, my family went to Disney World. At the time, we lived in Virginia, which meant that in order to get to Space Mountain, we had to drive from the D.C. area all the way to Orlando. To survive an eleven-hour drive with three daughters under the age of fourteen, my parents came up with a plan. They told us that when we got to Disney World, we would all get $50 as spending money, but that any misbehavior during the drive would lead to a deduction from that amount. And so the drive began.\n\nA few hours later, their plan had backfired. Rather than sitting quietly, trying to maintain our $50 allowances, my sisters and I had devised a game of our own, in which we attempted to provoke one another into losing more and more of their allowance. Anytime one of us misbehaved, my mother would take out her notepad where she was keeping track of deductions. While one sister sulked, the other two would pull down an imaginary lotto-lever and shout “cha-ching!” \n\nWe weren’t all that nice to one another. But our misbehavior pales in comparison to the sibling rivalry recounted in the story of Jacob and Esau, twin brothers who came out of the womb as enemies. And their parents were no help. From the beginning, Isaac and Rebekah chose favorites, and that favoritism only stoked the enmity between these brothers.\n\nAt stake in this passage is Esau’s birthright, the inheritance he stood to receive as the firstborn of his family. Knowing the value of that inheritance, Jacob plotted against his older brother, as if land and money were a finite resource. Meanwhile, Esau didn’t place adequate value on his birthright. He was “immoral and irreverent,” selling “his birthright in exchange for one meal” (Hebrews 12:16). Know this: favoritism and strife is not God’s plan. In fact, the Mosaic Law will later forbid a father from favoring a younger son merely because he comes from a preferred wife (Deuteronomy 21:15–17). But for now, we see that Jacob uses the means at his disposal to manipulate his way into wealth. \n\nGod is not interested in breaking up families over dollars and cents. Perhaps the greatest problem with Jacob and Esau’s behavior is that they both forgot God’s character. They forgot that the same God who blessed Isaac also blessed Ishmael. God never runs out of goodness. He does not “dock” us for misbehavior, nor will He look favorably upon those who provoke others into deceit. God’s goodness exists equally for His dearly loved children. We know this, because Jesus calls us His friends (John 15:!5). \n\nJesus, the most favored Son of all, gave us the right to become His brothers and sisters, His co-heirs to the kingdom (Romans 8:17). He is willing to share the blessing. He knows there is more than enough blessing to go around.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nThis morning, I opened up Facebook to discover that a celebrity picked my friend’s book for her highly influential book club. Rather than experience a surge of excitement for my friend, I felt the sinking pull of sadness. I didn’t even pause for a moment to feel happy for my friend; instead, I rushed to despondency, dejection, defeat. One question screamed loudly, over and over again in my mind: Why not me?\n\nPeople have plenty of conversations these days about the dangers of comparison, but I rarely hear the “j” word: jealousy. Jealousy is dirty. It’s dark and venomous and seeps into my consciousness like poison. In those moments, I’m not just wishing I had it better; I’m wishing that the other person had it worse. Yikes. I try to swallow the sadness—I leave a comment, I say congratulations—and I mean it… eventually. But my initial reaction isn’t charitable or kind. \n\nMy heart’s natural posture isn’t to hope for the blessing of others; it’s to hoard every good thing for myself. I have to keep that ugly truth in mind as I read today’s passage. I’m not all that different from Jacob. And if I had the chance to skew my future for the better, I might just put on some goatskins too. \n\nThe rivalry between these brothers, stoked by the favoritism in their parents, creates a toxic ripple effect that flows out for many generations. In yesterday’s reading, Jacob entrapped Esau, and Esau stupidly traded his birthright for a bowl of soup. In today’s passage, Jacob schemes with his mother Rebekah to steal even more from Esau: his father’s blessing. Words are powerful, but these aren’t just words. When Isaac speaks a blessing over Jacob, he’s passing along a divinely ordained covenant with Yahweh. He’s telling the family secret. He’s bringing Jacob into the Abrahamic covenant, and essentially saying, “Through your family, God will redeem the world.”\n\nI have to wonder why Rebekah was so adamant that Jacob become the favored, blessed son. Maybe Esau was not that bright? We know he traded a huge inheritance for a bowl of soup. We’re told his wives were a thorn in Rebekah’s side. Maybe she saw that Esau’s poor choices could negatively impact the future. But no matter what her reason for favoring Jacob, her methods to secure his position were totally wrong. She offers no directness, no honesty. She initiates no difficult conversations. Her only tactics are manipulation and deceit.\n\nThe Bible is full of humans, not heroes. And yet, God still fulfills His promises to His people. Despite the fact that Jacob is a master manipulator, God continued to work out His plan through these sinful people, moving history ever closer toward a Savior who could save us from our jealousy, our deceptions, our fears. \n\nJesus lived a perfect life. He didn’t have to scheme to receive anything, because He created everything. And yet, for the joy set before Him—including an eternity spent with you and me—He endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God (Hebrews 12:2; 1:3). And now, we have a brother in heaven. And He is the best brother, because He wants to share the gifts of His family with us (Romans 8:16–17). He hoards nothing.\n\nEven when I am faithless, He is faithful. Even when I am jealous, He is there, ready to forgive and put salve on those self-inflicted wounds. Even when I scheme to build my own earthly kingdom, Jesus gently turns my eyes back to the city with eternal foundations—the one built by God, and shared with me (Revelation 21:7). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nMy family recently subscribed to a new television streaming service, one that walks me down memory lane with beloved after-school TV shows and movies that I watched as a kid. Revisiting those stories, and sharing them anew with my daughters, has been so much fun.\n\nNarratives shape us. Good stories can awaken our desire for eternity, reminding us of the good in the world, while lifting the veil on the darkest parts of the human experience. \n\nI think the story of Jacob and his two wives, sisters Leah and Rachel, checks all of those boxes. It is a story brewed in brokenness and stirred with deceit, envy, and deep sadness. As a kid, I thought it was so very sweet, a little like a fairy tale: How romantic that Jacob loved Rachel enough to work for seven years to marry her! \n\nBut revisiting the story as an adult unlocks deeper truths about what I’m reading. Laban used his power to deceive Jacob into fourteen years of labor. Leah was cast aside and considered ugly, while Rachel gloated over her favor with Jacob—that is, until Leah bore sons, while Rachel could not. What a desperately sad story about two broken marriages, rival sisters, and a deceptive uncle who repeatedly manipulated his kin for profits. \n\nJacob was deceived. Leah was rejected and unloved. Rachel was emptied out by envy. Laban saw profits instead of people. \n\nWhen Leah bears Jacob’s sons, she names them Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah. With each son’s birth, she hopes that Jacob will love her. But by the time Judah is born, she seems to relent and refocus her affections on her God, saying, “This time I will praise the LORD” (Genesis 29:35). \n\nBetween Leah and Rachel and their servant women Bilhah and Zilpah, Jacob had twelve sons. These twelve sons would go on to be the patriarchs of the twelve tribes of Israel, and from the tribe of Judah, Jesus would be born. This son of the unloved wife would lead to the birth of the Messiah, who would bear the weight of every broken relationship. \n\nThe sad twists of this story lead us to look forward to the cross, because it is the only lens that allows us to see the grief and sadness that come from broken relationships more clearly. And yet, the good news of Jesus doesn’t change what we feel when we are mistreated, deceived, or utterly distracted with envy. \n\nEach of those scenarios tears at our relationships with other people, inevitably causing us to see people as less than the image-bearers God created us to be. We wound and are wounded. People become objects, wrong sources of our happiness (like Rachel was to Jacob), transactional sources of labor and economic gain (like Jacob was to Laban), or they make us the victim of our own disordered desires (like Rachel did to Leah). \n\nBut Jesus takes all of that–every objectifying, victimizing, heartbreaking, manipulative, broken interaction–and instead, offers us perfect healing and a gospel-paved way to reconciliation. As we read on, Jacob will experience total reconciliation with his brother Esau. While not every relationship experiences that kind of healing in this life, as we seek to treat other people the way Jesus treats us, we can lean on the shared gift of the gospel to be the common ground of grace. It is all we have to offer. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nI love this story. I think it’s because somehow I missed it growing up, and when I read it as an adult, it moved me to tears. I remember hearing the part of Jacob’s story from the end of Genesis 32, where he wrestles with God, but I’d never really heard his story from chapter 33—and this story has a happy ending. \n\nWe don’t actually get to say that very often about many stories in the Bible, and certainly not the stories in found in Genesis. In fact, every story about Jacob leading up to this one hasn’t necessarily been fun to read. Following Jacob’s narrative, we see that he chooses to collude with his mother in order to steal the birthright from his older brother Esau. He goes on to be deceived into marrying a woman he doesn’t love. And he is exploited by his father-in-law, Laban, forced into years of servitude. \n\nIn Genesis 31, Jacob begins to journey back to his home where he will meet his estranged brother, Esau. In stealing Esau’s birthright, Jacob wronged his brother terribly. And now, he brings his wives, children, and livestock on a journey to meet him again. He packs up a massive gift offering, trying to win Esau’s affections (or tolerance) with whatever he can give. \n\nHere’s the stunningly beautiful, perfect portrait of God’s free grace to us: Esau runs to Jacob, embraces him, and says “I have enough, my brother… Keep what you need” (Genesis 33:19). Esau’s reaction moves me to tears and makes me want to shout out in celebration—all at the same time—because this story is a picture of what God offers me. Their reconciliation is just a foretaste of our own reconciliation with our God: a redeemed relationship that we cannot buy, we cannot earn, and we cannot lose. I have wronged God. Apart from Christ, I was estranged from Him. Everything that Jacob did to Esau, I have done ten times over to everyone I know. \n\nI can imagine myself before Him. I’m trembling as I hold out my “good deeds” as an offering to Him, a way to make our relationship right, and He responds by telling me He not only has enough—He is enough. \n\nGod provided redemption through Jesus for His children, and His work on the cross is enough to cover every sin. Jesus secured the redemption of those who believe in Him. And the Holy Spirit seals us for the day of redemption, when we will live with God forever. Thanks be to God!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nAfter being married just three years, my husband and I moved away from the city I grew up in, all our friends, our families, and our church community. We left to attend graduate school in a state five hours away, which isn’t really that far, but in the post-move shock of everything being so painfully new, I struggled mightily.\n\nTwo years later, we moved again, closer to home in proximity and yet every day we felt further and further away from relationship. While we now had a baby, I still had no friends, which left me a particularly unhealthy combination of angry, sad, and lonely. In the end, we limped home in a moving truck with a baby who had just learned to crawl. And as I stood there in our new apartment, finally holding the keys in my hand, I wept. God had called us back to the place we had ached to be for so long. \n\nIn Genesis 35, God called Jacob home to Bethel, where He had first appeared to him. In Genesis 28, Jacob saw a stairway to God in a dream. And God made him this epic promise: “I will give you and your offspring the land on which you are lying… All the peoples on earth will be blessed through your offspring” (Genesis 28:13–14). In response, Jacob named the place Bethel, declaring, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it … What an awesome place this is! This is none other than the house of God. This is the gate of heaven” (vv.16–17). \n\nSo when God called Jacob back to Bethel after many years away, Jacob reacted immediately. First, he told his family to purge their homes of any idols to false gods, promising to build an altar to worship the God who had been there in his “day of distress” and “everywhere” he had since gone (Genesis 35:3). When Jacob returned to Bethel, God gave him the new name of “Israel” and promised that both nations and kings would descend from him (vv.10–11). Jacob would set up an Ebenezer, a stone marker to remember and celebrate the Lord’s faithfulness in all circumstances.\n\nIn his hymn “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing,” a twenty-two-year-old Robert Robinson declared:\n\nHere I raise my Ebenezer;  Hither by Thy help I’m come;  And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,  Safely to arrive at home.  Jesus sought me when a stranger,  Wandering from the fold of God;  He, to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood.\n\nBecause of Jesus, we can claim the same promise of an eternal home, the door opened for us by His person and work on the cross. And we can pray, thanking, celebrating, and remembering the promises He has made to us in His Word, and that ultimately, our forever home is with Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nThe ugliest moments of my life have been marked by jealousy. It is perhaps my most defining sin, and it masquerades as pride, fear, insecurity, and relationship-crushing meanness. Envy dehumanizes everyone around me; it removes their own agency as creative, talented, smart image-bearers of God. I no longer see them as their own persons, but rather as measuring sticks for my own worth. Too often, I think, I’m better than so-and-so at that, but nowhere near as good as that other person. If jealousy is my economy, cynicism and narcissism are the currency I trade. If that sounds harsh or out of proportion, it’s not. I think that jealousy and envy are the root of most conflicts between people, and unadmitted jealousy festers and slowly destroys relationships. \n\nEnvy is threaded through the Bible, a throughline of sin from Cain and Abel, Rachel and Leah, Saul and David, the pharisees who watched Jesus draw crowds to Himself, and more. In history, art, and literature, examples are rampant. In Shakespeare’s Othello, Iago cautions Othello about such envy: “Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy! It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on.”\n\nJoseph is the victim of his brothers’ jealousy, which robs him of his family, his home, his dignity, and almost his life. His brothers strip him of his robe and would have killed him, but sold him to a band of traders instead. It was perhaps the equivalent of death in their eyes: they expected to never see him again, and delivered the news of his death to their father Jacob. \n\nAs modern readers, we know how the story goes: Joseph trusts the Lord, and the Lord protects him. He rises to power in Egypt and eventually saves his family from famine and forgives his brothers. But the moment we read about today in Genesis 37 doesn’t have any of that goodness— only pain. And by not reading ahead, we can force ourselves to sit in the devastation wreaked by Joseph’s brothers. Jacob mourns the loss of his son and cannot be comforted. Joseph is sold again, this time to an Egyptian official. No longer in control, Joseph has lost all agency at the hands of his jealous brothers. \n\nThis is that same “green-eyed monster,” and throughout Scripture, we are warned against its fallout. Proverbs 14:30 cautions that “a tranquil heart is life to the body, but jealousy is rottenness to the bones.” Ecclesiastes 4:4 tells us that “all labor and all skillful work is due to one person’s jealousy of another. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.” And James 3:16 advises that “where there is envy and selfish ambition, there is disorder and every evil practice.” \n\nScripture certainly doesn’t hold back about the consequences of jealousy, and neither should we. As I read about Joseph’s story, I’m aware that I should “let it read me”: Where is my jealousy hurting people that I love? Where is it corroding my heart and sowing disorder? Where is it disordering my priorities away from Christ and toward my own selfish gain? These are important questions to ask because jealousy isn’t something to be taken lightly. My prayer is that I never will.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nGenesis 38 breaks into the Joseph narrative with a bold, complicated, very broken story. Joseph is sold into slavery, and the very next verse we read is about his brother Judah. Judah was one of Leah’s sons, and Leah the wife that Jacob didn’t love. Judah was also the patriarch of the lineage of King David and Jesus. So this story, and Judah’s legacy, isn’t as much an interjection as an interlude that gives us a glimpse of God’s grace and the amazing ways His promises were fulfilled despite all sorts of human interference. \n\nSome cultural background helps this story, because it’s a rather tangled web of relationships. Levirate marriage was a practice in the ancient Near East that was later codified in Deuteronomy 25 as part of the Mosaic law. Basically, it meant that if a man died before he had a child, his brother had to marry his wife, and their first child would carry on the first (dead) brother’s name and place in the lineage. \n\nJudah had three sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah. Er married a woman named Tamar, and Er was so evil that he died. Onan married Tamar, but didn’t want to preserve his brother’s place in the lineage, and so he did not impregnate Tamar, and was killed for that sin. Judah had seen both of his sons die after marrying Tamar, so he hid Shelah away and kept him from Tamar. \n\nTamar, the widow who had the right to bear Judah’s eldest son’s child and continue the family line, responded. She dressed as a prostitute, tempted Judah, and conceived a child with him without him knowing who she was (Genesis 38:13–19). Later, when Judah found out she was pregnant, he threatened to kill her for adultery (against Shelah, whom she was technically betrothed to). When she revealed that Judah was, in fact, the father, he then admitted that he had wronged her. Tamar had twin sons, Perez and Zerah, and Perez continued the family line and his descendants included King David and Jesus. \n\nThat is a lot of background to unpack a story that is, at its root, a story of God’s faithfulness to a family. God had made a promise to Abraham. He made a promise to Isaac and to Jacob. And at so many turns, the promise appears threatened by someone’s sin. Judah almost destroyed what he should never have had in the first place: the blessing of the line of Christ. \n\nBut the author of this very complicated story is the Author of the ultimate story: the story where God wins, where His promises all come true, and we are given the free gift of grace purchased on the cross by Jesus, the Son of God who came to earth as a baby in the line of Judah. God can and does redeem the hardest, most impossible, most complicated stories. What a gift it is to be His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nAt first glance, Joseph’s story reads like a set of extraordinary circumstances lived by an ordinary man. If that’s the case, it would be enough to hold our collective attention for a moment, but not one second more. So why is it we are still talking about him?\n\nJoseph was the favorite son of Jacob (Genesis 37:3). You may have heard of his coat of many colors, or perhaps the time his brothers sold him into slavery (vv.3, 27–28). Joseph stood firm against the temptations of Potiphar’s wife, even though doing so landed him in prison. (Genesis 39). He’s the one who relocated the baby nation of Israel to Egypt and protected them from eventual famine (Genesis 47). \n\nThese are the facts we see on the surface, but look again. There is an undercurrent to Joseph’s story that points to a deeper truth. We see it written all over Genesis 39. We read that the Lord “was with Joseph,” and when his master realized this, he also saw that “the LORD made everything he did successful” (vv.2–3). The Lord remained “with Joseph and extended kindness to him,” blessing “the Egyptian’s house” and making everything he did successful (vv. 5,21–23). It’s clear that while on a human level Joseph’s life was marked by betrayal, fear, and desperate circumstances, on the supernatural level, his story is about so much more—because of God’s favor. \n\nWhen Joseph’s brothers plotted his death— God preserved his life.\n\nWhen the schemes of man made Joseph a slave and a refugee—God gave him favor in a foreign land. \n\nWhen he was falsely accused and thrown in jail—God infused Joseph’s prison time with purpose. \n\nWhen there was no way for Joseph to free himself from his shackles—God set Him free. \n\nWhen Joseph was cut off from his family—God made a way for radical reconciliation. \n\nWhen Joseph lived in a land of famine—God filled his storehouses. \n\nJoseph was a nobody. Just an overlooked kid with a string of bad luck. Nothing to see here—but God. God was using the circumstances of Joseph’s life to tell a bigger, more important story: the story about His glory. \n\nGod’s story of grace is the undercurrent of our lives too. He proves His own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). He remains faithful to us, even when we are not (1 Corinthians 10:13). He is “rich in mercy, [and] because of his great love that he had for us, made us alive with Christ even though we were dead in trespasses. [We] are saved by grace!” (Ephesians 2:4–5). \n\nThe reality of God’s grace turns every moment of rejection, every false accusation or overlooked achievement, every fear and every famine, into an opportunity to showcase His glory. He is the point—not us. Thousands of years later, we are still compelled to remember the story of a shepherd boy turned slave, who was transformed from a prisoner into a man of great power—not by Joseph’s strength of character or accomplishment, but by God’s design and power. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nOf all the drama and intrigue contained in Genesis 41 and 42, these four words capture my attention the most: “after two whole years” (Genesis 41:1, ESV). Joseph sat in a foreign prison, innocent of the crimes he was accused of committing—for two whole years. That’s a long time to wait for your rescue, a long time to wonder if a savior is coming, a long time to pray for God to come through. Except, on God’s redemptive timeline, it isn’t. When God decided to restore Joseph, it happened in the blink of an eye: “Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit” (v.14). \n\nThough I know the stories in God’s Word aren’t about me, I can’t help but identify with Joseph. I’d go all in on the bet that you can identify with him too. Here we sit, longing for our rescue. We’ve got heartaches and breaks we want mended. We’ve got needs we cannot meet for ourselves. We’ve got broken bodies, broken homes, and broken cultures. There are times our fallen world feels like a prison. In Christ, we have been made new (2 Corinthians 5:17), but it doesn’t always feel like it. We are still waiting for complete deliverance from our brokenness, and we have been waiting our whole lives. And yet… “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet… the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:52).\n\nWhatever it is that you’re waiting for God to do, whether you’ve been waiting two years or two decades and even when the wait feels like it will last forever, there is hope worth holding on to. Someday, when Christ returns for His bride, we will exchange prisons for the fullness of His presence, pits for His perfect peace. \n\nThe wait often feels like it’s lasting too long—except, on God’s timeline, it isn’t. Watch for Jesus with hope that is rooted in expectation, knowing that the wait, no matter how long, will not have the last word.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by geodes. They’re unremarkable on the outside; to the untrained eye, they just look like rocks (often ugly ones). But crack a geode open and you’ll find your breath has been taken away. Each one is filled with a tiny city of crystals that shine and sparkle in a spectacular variety of colors and formations.\n\nThere are many geodes in Joseph’s story, moments that are unremarkable at first, even ugly. But as the Bible cracks each one open and all is revealed, our breath is taken away by the beauty God brings about in the midst of the ugly and unremarkable.\n\nOne geode is the silver Joseph snuck back into the sacks of his brothers. Genesis 42 records: “Joseph then gave orders to fill their containers with grain, return each man’s silver to his sack, and give them provisions for their journey. This order was carried out” (v.25). For Joseph, this was a moment of generosity. He opted to give blessings to the brothers who had taken so much from him. But to the brothers, who could not scrub the blood of their brother from their hearts and hands, the money was a curse, highlighting their sin and guilt. \n\nThere are both blessings and perceived curses in our lives. We think we can distinguish the difference between the two. Blessings look and feel good. Situations that seem to be cursed, in our limited, human perspective, do not. But what if blessings and burdens are in cahoots? What if God can use the seemingly unremarkable and ugly parts of our lives to reveal His goodness and provision?\n\nWhen the famine forced his brothers to return to Egypt a second time to purchase grain for their hungry families, it was the silver in their sacks that brought them back to Joseph. Without money to return, surely they would have avoided the foreign ruler who imprisoned them, kept their brother Simeon, and ordered them to bring him their beloved baby brother. But once the geode was cracked open, deep beauty was revealed. \n\n“Then the steward said, ‘May you be well. Don’t be afraid.  Your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your bags.  I received your silver.’ Then he brought Simeon out to them” (Genesis 43:23). \n\nThey returned the silver, and brought their brother Benjamin to Joseph, and Simeon was returned to them. But look again. Standing in their brother’s presence, reconciliation was possible. The family was reunited and brought together to live in the thriving nation of Egypt.\n\nLook again. Crack open another geode. The events of Joseph’s story set the stage for Israel’s later enslavement by a new Pharaoh. That moment of history is ugly, but look at how God continues to work. Israel’s deliverance through Moses, the Passover, and the parting of the Red Sea. Keep looking. Keep cracking. From the nation of Israel came our Savior whose birth seemed unremarkable and death was horrific, but whose sacrifice granted us salvation—the greatest treasure of all. \n\nThere is no way to know the riches God can bring in the ugly, rocky places of our lives. We can trust the treasure is there and that in His timing, beautiful, sparkling gems will be revealed.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nSometimes the language of Scripture is so tender, I’m tempted to look away. We find such a moment in Genesis 48. When Jacob sent his favorite son on a simple errand to check the family pasture, that son, Joseph, was barely out of boyhood. Scripture tells us he was just seventeen years old (Genesis 37:2). But Joseph never came home. Jacob believed the story his other sons told him, that his favorite boy was dead. He must have mentally buried all of his hopes for Joseph’s future. \n\nIn the unbelievable providence of God, Jacob was reunited with his boy. But Joseph wasn’t a teenager anymore. The son Israel lost now had sons of his own, and Israel’s hopes for his boy were suddenly resurrected. You can almost hear the wonder and surprise in his voice when he looked at his grandsons for the first time and asked, “Who are these?” (Genesis 48:8).\n\nIsrael wasted no time on icebreakers. Seeing your children taken and returned has a way of cutting through the trivial. “Bring them to me and I will bless them,” he said (v.9). Scripture describes Jacob as a tired old man, with eyes that didn’t work like they used to (v.11), but he had seen enough in his life to know to hold his blessings close. Knowing this, these words in particular from this interaction put a lump in my throat: \n\n“Then Joseph took them from his father’s knees and bowed with his face to the ground… then [Jacob] blessed Joseph and said…  ‘the angel who has redeemed me from all harm— may he bless these boys’” (vv.12,15–16). \n\nThe image of Ephraim and Manassah sitting on their grandfather’s knee pulls every string in my heart. There’s such tenderness in this moment. Such precious, paternal prayer. The words of blessing Jacob spoke over his grandsons weren’t grandiose. Though Jacob wrestled with God to secure his own blessing (Genesis 32:22–32), for the next generation, he sweetly whispered “bless these boys.” It was a prayer God certainly answered—a prayer God is answering still. \n\nYou don’t have to strongarm God to get Him to listen. Brute force is not the secret to praying with power. Lift your babies onto your knee. Grab a friend. Pull her close. Simply ask God to bless the ones you love. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nAt the end of the day, and the end of our lives, we all want to be carried home. \n\nIsrael experienced the dysfunction and joy of family (Genesis 28 and 29), life and death (Genesis 29–30, 35:18), abundance and famine (Genesis 30 and 42). He wrestled with God and walked with Him. \n\nThere is typography to all of our lives, highs and lows, peaks and valleys, times when God’s blessings flow like roaring rivers, and times when they seem like a barely trickling brook. Each individual moment, experience, or circumstance is just a snapshot; only God has the 10,000 foot view. And at every elevation, He is wooing us back toward home. \n\nThough Israel met the love of his life and experienced smashing success in Haran, he never stopped thinking about Canaan. Though his children and grandchildren put down deep roots in Egypt, he never shook the pull of home. After calling them to himself to offer one final blessing over each of them, he gave instructions for his own burial—not in Egypt, where Joseph was interred, but with his forefathers, in the cave found in a field, in the land of Canaan (Genesis 49:29–30). He told them: “This is the field Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hethite as burial property. Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried there, Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried there, and I buried Leah there’” (Genesis 49:29–31). Israel wanted to rest with his people.\n\nWhether we are in a moment of success or failure, whether we find ourselves deeply rooted or adrift, whether in the highest of highs or the lowest of lows—our hearts ache for our true and future home. There is a longing, placed deep inside of each one of us, not for the land of our fathers, but the land of the Father. We know, deep down in our guts, that eternity with Him is where we belong. \n\nIsrael’s ache exists in each one of us. Like him, we want to know that we won’t have to stay forever in this foreign, broken land. In every peak and every valley, we can cling to this hope: in Christ, our homesickness will be satisfied. Someday soon—it won’t be long now—we, too, will be carried home. \n\n",

Still, I usually crack one open once I’m overfull from a generous plate of sesame chicken and rice. Despite my satisfied appetite, I nibble on a bite of the sweet shell while reading the words printed on the tiny slip of paper inside.\n\nI’m not sure why I have trouble resisting that treat at the bottom of my takeout bag. Maybe it’s my love of sugar, but I think it’s something more. In a world that seems to grow more uncertain by the day, we want a sure thing. We want to know what’s coming, what’s not, what’s next. We know a fortune cookie isn’t going to change our circumstances, but it’s fun to pretend, just for a moment, that it might.\n\nWhen the book of Joshua opens, the Israelites have come to the end of one long, unpredictable journey. Unpredictable as far as the humans involved are concerned, that is. The Lord—God Almighty, the Holy One—has been with His people each step of the way. He has never left them, never forsaken them, never taken back His covenant even when they gave Him a million sinful reasons to do so. And here, as Israel stands on the edge of the last leg of their journey to the Promised Land, He promises that His faithfulness will continue.\n\nListen to these phrases of certainty offered by both God and His newly appointed servant, Joshua, over the span of just 18 verses (emphasis mine):\n\n“I am giving [this land to the Israelites]” (v. 2).\n\n“I have given you [every place your foot touches]” (v. 3).\n\n“Your territory will be [where I’ve appointed it]” (v. 4).\n\n“I will be with you” (v. 5).\n\n“I will not leave you or forsake you” (v. 5).\n\n“You will distribute the land I swore to their fathers” (v. 6).\n\n“You will have success” [as you heed all of My instruction] (v. 7).\n\n“You will prosper and succeed” [when you observe My Word] (v. 8).\n\n“God is with you wherever you go” (v. 9).\n\n“You will be crossing the Jordan” (v. 11).\n\n“God is giving” [this land to you] (v. 11).\n\n“God will give you rest” (v. 13).\n\n“God will give you this land” (v. 13).\n\nAs profoundly complex as the situation seemed, it was also profoundly simple: God was keeping His promise, just like He always had and just like He always will.\n\nIsrael got the message, and they responded in kind: \n\n“Everything you have commanded us we will do, and everywhere you send us we will go. We will obey you, just as we obeyed Moses in everything” (v. 16-17, emphasis mine).\n\nIf you’ve read ahead, you know how this story ends. The God of Israel was completely faithful to His people. They did cross the Jordan, and they did take possession of the land He’d promised their ancestor Abraham 450 years earlier. You may also know that Israel did not hold to the “everything” and “everywhere” they’d promised. Yes, they followed Joshua. They heeded his instructions to prepare, to remember, to go (v. 11-13), but their faithfulness was only partial. Like a sieve, obedience slipped through the holes in their good intentions.\n\nTheir faith was not perfect, but God’s Word and faithfulness did not falter. \n\nThis Bible we open together today makes some bold promises. These are not fortune-cookie promises to be read one moment and tossed into the takeout bag the next. These are holy promises. These are true promises (Psalm 19:7). \n\nWhen we believe on Jesus Christ, we will be saved (Romans 10:9).\n\nThrough the gift of His Holy Spirit, Christ will never leave us (Matthew 28:20).\n\nBy His death and resurrection, Jesus has taken on our sin and granted us His righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21).\n\nWhen God says “I will” and “I have,” He will and He has. \n\nPraise the Lord, His faithfulness fills in the cracks of our obedience! Praise the Lord, we can walk with courage and confidence into the certainty of a tomorrow where God will never leave us or forsake us. Praise the Lord that as co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17), every foot forward is another step on the journey of coming home to a place we’ve never been. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Joshua 2:1-24, Joshua 3:1-17, Numbers 13:25-33, Hebrews 11:31\n\nWe’re in that phase of family where at least one, if not all three, of our children end up in our bed by the time the sun comes up. At some point in the night one of the little people in our home will inevitably wake. Rather than rolling over and going back to sleep, he or she will stand up, drag his or her sleepy self down the stairs, round the corner into our room, and climb into our bed, right between my husband and me.\n\nOther than the growing amount of room they take up in our comfy bed, there’s something else I’ve noticed about this nightly ritual. Our comfort-seeking kiddos always crawl in our bed and lie down facing their papa, every single time. Whether the culprit is a bad dream in their heads or a raging storm outside the window, their response is the same: they face their father.\n\nI love the juxtaposition of the stories we find in chapters 2 and 3 of Joshua. Two very different stories of God’s children choosing to face and follow their holy heavenly Father in the face of impossible circumstances. And in both situations, He proves Himself worthy of their unabashed trust and holy fear.\n\nRahab, a woman known primarily by her sin, met the one true God in a precarious time in the history of her homeland. She’d heard the stories of God’s stunning faithfulness to His people, and she knew they were coming to possess the land. Her neighbors were frightened by the evidence of His greatness; in Rahab’s own words, they were panicked (Joshua 2:9). But a different kind of fear was taking root in Rahab. She was coming to fear the Lord.\n\nBelieving the God of Israel was “God in heaven above and on earth below” (Joshua 2:11), Rahab risked everything to offer refuge to the two spies sent by Joshua into Jericho. In a culture of faithlessness, she dared to face full-on the holiness of God and follow Him in a bold act of faith. Later, her family would be spared because of it (Joshua 6:17).\n\nIsrael had seen God’s rescue not from afar but up close. When Joshua said to them, “The Lord will do wonders among you tomorrow,” they knew he meant it (Joshua 3:5). So Israel faced the ark of the covenant, which symbolized the very presence of the Lord (Joshua 3:10-11), and moved forward to take possession of the “land flowing with milk and honey” (Numbers 13:27). Even following the ark among the masses required faith. Surely the people remembered the time the scouts reported back to Moses, Aaron, and all of Israel that the promised land was inhabited by a people impossible to defeat. “They are stronger than we are!” the scouts cried out (Numbers 13:31). But they were not stronger than Israel’s God.\n\nIsn’t this what it’s like to follow the Almighty Lord? Sometimes, like Rahab, you walk the road alone, stepping out on nothing but faith and a holy fear of the God who rescues His people. Sometimes you move with the masses, direction clear as day, but a nagging doubt nonetheless. What if we aren’t strong enough? What if we’re defeated? Then the God of the impossible dries up a riverbed for your feet to walk across, just as He did when your wilderness journey began (Joshua 3:17; Exodus 14:22). \n\nFrom impossible to impossible, the road of faith is under the command of our sovereign God, beginning to end. A people with an impossible future and a harlot with an impossible past—both fixed their eyes on the only true God and neither were beyond the reach of His rescue.\n\nNo situation is beyond the sovereignty and strength of our God. He is the God of Abraham, of Moses, of Joshua, of Rahab. He is the same—yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8). Fear Him in His awesome glory. Face Him in His limitless compassion. Follow Him wherever He leads, no matter the scene to your right or left. Fix your eyes on His presence and His promises.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Joshua 4:1-24, Joshua 5:1-15, Exodus 25:10-22\n\nI think I have a super-nose. It has twice identified dangerous fires in the nick of time, once diagnosed an ear infection in a baby, and can always sense any change in my husband’s morning ablutions. The poor man can’t wash his face with a different soap without my nose sensing the difference. I’ve learned never to ignore a smell because scents yield up so much valuable information.\n\nOur sense of smell also delivers when it comes to evoking memories. I learned to depend on smell when I was still young, so when I found myself in a moment that I wanted to impress on my memory forever, I used a scent to anchor it. Over time, I amassed a rolodex of lotions and perfumes that I used as markers for memory; I needed only to breathe in the scent to remind me of those treasured days. The smell of lime conjures up the peak of the Kahlenberg looking over the Danube River, and the smell of strawberry reminds me of our first apartment.\n\nPurposeful, intentional memory building is not my own clever invention; God used markers in the Old and New Testaments to memorialize significant moments in the lives of His covenant people. Just like the Israelites, we are “forgetful hearers” and we need help remembering God’s past faithfulness and His future promises (James 1:25).\n\nIsrael had both God’s promises and His faithfulness to remember, and their escape from Egypt was bookended by two unbelievable river crossings: the Red Sea and the Jordan River. God taught them to remember by establishing an equally unbelievable monument. He commanded twelve men to heave giant river stones out of the muddy riverbed on their shoulders and carry them to shore. They muscled these stones into an heavy pile. As the slimy green algae dried on the rocks, they stood back, wiping their hands, to look at what they had done, and saw an impossible, otherworldly monument. These were rocks from the very bottom of the Jordan River. They never should have been seen, and yet, because God miraculously stopped the river, they were stacked on the shore as a reminder of God’s impossible miracle for generations.\n\nThis unlikely mound of river rocks was a testament and a signal that this was the end of an era. No more would they be wilderness wanderers; they had finally come home. “And the day after they ate from the produce of the land, the manna ceased. Since there was no more manna for the Israelites, they ate from the crops of the land of Canaan that year” (Joshua 5:12). God underscored the end of their travels by putting a stop to the manna. They could set up homes, and grow their own food on their own land.\n\nAs they settled in to this wonderful home they had never known before, it would have been easy to forget how they got there. Their legendary victories were only achieved when they walked in obedience, and their devastating failures were a direct result of failing to obey God. The people of Israel were inclined to forget the source of their help, and we lean right with them in that same direction.\n\nEven as we set up memorials, using the power of sight and smell and our other senses to remember our lives, Joshua drives us to remember those old and sure memorials of God’s faithfulness. Israel’s epic victories were not undergirded by their own doing, but by God’s faithfulness to His promises. \n\n“In the future, when your children ask their fathers, ‘What is the meaning of these stones?’ you should tell your children, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’ For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over. This is so that all the people of the earth may know that the Lord’s hand is mighty, and so that you may always fear the Lord your God.”\n\n– Joshua 4:21-24\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Joshua 6:1-27, 1 Kings 16:34, Colossians 2:11-12, Exodus 3:1-6\n\nMost people move into a retirement community later in life, but I’ve been a part of one since birth. My dad has always been in the business of caring for the elderly, and as a result, I’ve gained some serious benefits—mainly, a personal cheering squad. They are always up for a competitive card game or impromptu ice cream cone, and never forget to tell me how tall I’ve gotten. And boy, do these people know how to throw parties. I’ll never forget the Bon Voyage party we had for the chapel. \n\nYou see, the community was going through a huge, exciting expansion—new office buildings and homes going up left and right. There was just one problem standing, quite literally, in the way of those new plans: the community’s beloved chapel, the centerpiece of the campus. Instead of letting the bulldozer run its course, the community decided to uproot the chapel from its original location and transfer it to the other side of the property. There, it could continue to be enjoyed for years to come. \n\nThe day of the move, my parents let me miss a few hours of the second grade to witness it. We stood under the porte-cochere, eating cream cheese bagels while the community band warmed their bagpipes and trumpets. Surrounded by dirt piles and construction hats, it was hard to miss the shocking upheaval of the chapel’s uprooted foundation. Still, there was much to celebrate. The chapel itself, the very place where this community had regularly recounted God’s faithfulness, remained safe and sound. \n\nIn our reading today, we’re entering a different construction site together, one filled with its own upheavals and unknowns. The broad-shouldered city of Jericho is fearfully closed to the Israelites—no one goes out, no one comes in. Under the Lord’s direction, a curse is imposed on the city and its idol-loving inhabitants when Joshua and the priests begin to march around it. Carrying the ark of the covenant, they keep in step with God’s commands and watch as the walls around Jericho fall at their feet. \n\n“The people advanced into the city, each man straight ahead, and they captured the city. They completely destroyed everything in the city with the sword—every man and woman, both young and old, and every ox, sheep, and donkey.”\n\n-Joshua 6:20-21\n\nGod gave them the city. \n\nNow, I don’t know about you, but I’m not sure how I’m supposed to feel about this. Yes, justice was served. Yes, the good guys prevailed. And yes, God’s perfect plan unfurled as He’d promised. But that doesn’t change the fact that they were standing in a destruction zone, does it?\n\nSitting with the truth of crumbled walls and a city destroyed, I cannot help but wonder what this says about God. We readily cozy up to God’s promises of love, restoration, and peace, but what do we do when His promises include curses, death, and brokenness? \n\nWe trust Him still. From where we sit, it’s hard to understand the mind and ways of God (Isaiah 55:8-9). But the just consequences of sin do not lessen the sovereign goodness of our God.\n\nAt the intersection of God’s wrath and mercy, we find two constants: His kept promises and His unfailing love. To trust the fullness of His character, we need Him to be steady and sure. In chapter 6 we encounter God’s faithfulness, not only in the midst of a crumbling Jericho, but also in the protection of Rahab, who became part of the lineage of Christ (Matthew 1:5). \n\nBecause of who He is, we can always stare into the dark unknown of destruction to find an unchanging God. In the midst of every upheaval and replanting, He is faithful.\n\nPraise the Lord for every promise kept. \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Joshua 7:1-26, Joshua 8:1-35, Deuteronomy 9:26-29\n\nWho of us has not lamented like Joshua, beating our breasts and rending our garments, surveying the landscape of darkness, rebellion, and fear in front of us? Many of us have fretted that God’s name will not be made great, but all too often we say, “What can we do to make Your name great?” Joshua, praise God, got the pronoun right: “What will You do for your own great name?” (Joshua 7:9, emphasis mine).\n\nIt’s strange, the knots we tie ourselves up in, the puzzles we struggle to fit ourselves into, the efforts we put forth to be the bringers of greatness to God. We want to be the world changers and the history makers, the people of God for God, with nothing standing in our way. But Joshua, in the face of Israel’s abundant sin, knew if God’s name was to be great, He Himself would be the one to do it—not man. \n\nWe think the world will be changed by our short-term missionary journeys, fiery sermons, and quippy books. We think we can bring glory to God’s name with our efforts of authenticity, by racking up social media “likes” and “followers,” by planting new churches, both big and small. We think we’ll glorify Him by performing awesome acts in His name and creating large gatherings for prayer and praise—by centering most things on the gospel, and relying on great graphics to take care of the rest. \n\nBut in Joshua chapter 7, here is how God chose to make His name great: \n\nJoshua lines up the twelve tribes.\n\nWithin those tribes, the clans.\n\nWithin those clans, the households.\n\nWithin those households, the men.\n\nThen one man: Achen.\n\nTo him, Joshua says, “My son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make a confession to Him. I urge you, tell me what you have done. Don’t hide anything from me” (v. 19).\n\nAnd here, among an entire nation, Achen is found out and then tells the truth: “I have stolen and I have hidden what I have stolen, and here is where it is” (vv. 20-21, my paraphrase).\n\nBut God already knew Achen and his actions. He knows ours, too. \n\nWhat if the way God chooses to make His name great is the difficult, relentless, painful, and excruciatingly long process of unearthing sin in our lives? What if the way God makes His name great is not through public acts of piety, but private acts of repentance? What if His greatest act of glory is in exposing the darkest of lies our hearts have clung to, only to replace them with the light of His mercy and Truth? \n\nAs Charles Spurgeon said, “It is far easier to fight with sin in public, than to pray against it in private.”\n\nToday, as you read this passage, do not ask how you can do great things for God. Instead, ask Him to unearth the secret sins in your heart, the places that need exposure to His light and healing in His presence. He knows them already and loves you still.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner. She blogs at Sayable, tweets @lorewilbert, and posts photos @loreferguson.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Joshua 9:1-27, Joshua 10:1-15, Ephesians 1:18-23\n\nNothing makes me hustle like a deadline. Seriously, mention one in conversation and I’ll be unable to hear you over the clock that starts ticking in my head. \n\nIn college, I worked for the school newspaper. The building was underground, beneath the university’s basketball court, filled with the sounds of screeching sneakers and jammed printers. Sleep was replaced by a steady stream of caffeine and adrenaline, while stories forcefully flowed out of our fingers to be placed in the hands of our readers a few short hours later. \n\nWe basked in the knowledge that news couldn’t become news without us. Everything was under our watch, from the latest rumors to the biggest announcements. The fluorescent hallway beams created a false sense of time, as we hibernated under the security of to-do lists and grammar rules. In the morning, we’d climb the stairs of reality, the latest issue in hand, to welcome the day. Before opening the door, we’d make bets on whether the sky would be dark or light, because we honestly couldn’t tell the difference from our journalism bunker. \n\nIn chapter 10, Joshua faces a firm deadline with a pretty serious agenda: save his people from the attack of five powerful kings. It’s a bleak situation until the Lord says, “Do not be afraid of them, for I have handed them over to you. Not one of them will be able to stand against you” (v. 8).\n\nIf God were to assign a project and a deadline to me, I imagine I’d descend the the stairs to the newspaper office and begin strategizing my next move, emerging with a plan in the morning. But that’s not what Joshua does. \n\nJoshua asks God to make the sun stand still, giving him time to fulfill the mission at once. And God does it. The sun stops in the middle of the sky, delaying its setting almost a full day and giving Joshua the time needed to accomplish His task. \n\nAs I think about what a sight this must’ve been, I can’t help but realize that, if it were me, I’d still be underground, oblivious to the stilled sun. Even worse than missing that newsworthy spectacle, I’d miss out on observing the intimate care of my Creator. \n\nWhile I no longer work for the newspaper and now spend most of my time above ground, I haven’t completely graduated from my own knee-deep ambition. I collect my cares and hide away from the very God who fought for Israel! But I don’t want to spend my days strategizing. I want to get busy living like God has called me to live. \n\nMay we ask the Lord for a faith like Joshua’s, boldly believing that God is in our corner. Let us stand and walk and live in the sunlight, knowing He is for us.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Joshua 10:16-43, Joshua 11:1-23, Psalm 110:1-7, Ephesians 1:3-14\n\nI only watch action movies for the romance. You know, the love subplot, where the guy-and-girl tale is interspersed between all the scenes of war and gore. Battles don’t interest me, nor do bomb explosions, car chases, guns, or swords. No matter the era or context of the film, something in my brain shuts off when the action picks up, and then that something turns back on to watch love rise from the rubble.\n\nWhen reading Joshua, I find myself doing much the same thing. I’m tempted to glaze over the battle scenes, the names of the countries conquered, and all those kings’ names I can’t pronounce. Until I get to the “good stuff,” I tune out, then tune back in once I get to… well, Psalms.\n\nBut something interesting happened as I was reading over this week’s passage. At first, I only saw scenes of conquest, of Israel taking each and every enemy in its path—Makkedah, Libnah, Lachish—a slew of battle scenes depicting how God’s people took over the north and south territory of Canaan. However, as I read the passage again, I began to see that, in the midst of all the action, another plot emerges.\n\nThese verses are more than a retelling of conquest and victory. We see this when we pay attention to the repetitive language in the text—language that emphasizes God’s devotion to Israel:\n\n“And the Lord also delivered [Libnah] and its king into the hands of Israel” (Joshua 10:30).\n\n“And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hands of Israel” (Joshua 10:32).\n\n“Do not be afraid…I will deliver all of them” (Joshua 11:6).\n\n“And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel” (Joshua 11:8).\n\nSimilarly, repetitive language is used to describe Joshua’s devotion to God’s command:\n\n“So Joshua conquered all the land… as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him” (Joshua 10:40).\n\n“So Joshua did to them as the Lord had told him” (Joshua 11:9).\n\n“He utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded” (Joshua 11:12).\n\n“As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that the Lord had commanded Moses” (Joshua 11:15).\n\nAs the dust settles on the battlefield, look for it: the making and fulfillment of a promise. Devotion, obedience, and a commitment to one another, at all costs. In the midst of the struggle and the fear is this command: “Do not be afraid” (Joshua 10:25).\n\nIt sounds like a love story, doesn’t it? The love of God for His people—a love that spans much further than the physical territory Joshua conquered. It’s a love that would eventually come down in human form to save not only Israel from their enemies, but also you and me from a fate we surely deserved: “We have redemption in Him through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding” (Ephesians 1:7-8).\n\nI no longer want to turn my head from the battle scenes of Joshua. I see my own redemptive story in there now, woven in and out with the assurance of deliverance and of promises fulfilled. Victory is found in Christ alone. This is the greatest love story we will ever know.\n\n",

Her husband, a pastor, had been kidnapped and killed just eighteen months earlier. Dabbing her eyes with a tissue, she quietly described to me the sorrow her family had endured.\n\nMy mind struggled to comprehend her pain. Honestly, I wanted to race back to the airplane lavatory and bolt the door against the suffering that was so palpable in the seat next to mine. Instead, I managed to get this sentence past the lump in my throat:\n\n“Are God’s promises true?”\n\nThis was a woman who knew Christ and yet had truly suffered. I wanted to know—I needed to know—if God even climbed into valleys as dark and deep as this to keep His promises to His people. The woman’s response?\n\n“Every single one of them.” \n\nThis sweet stranger had come face to face with darkness and found that Jesus truly is the Light of the World (John 8:12). \n\nShe had walked through the Valley of the Shadow of Death and discovered Jesus is the resurrection and the life (Psalm 23:4; John 11:25). \n\nShe had buried her treasure but found that the treasure of God’s presence had remained (Matthew 13:44). \n\nGod’s faithfulness in her life helped me remember His faithfulness in my own. When circumstances cause my anxious heart to question if God’s promises are really true, I need look no further than my own life to remind myself of His faithfulness. \n\nThis is what we find God’s people doing in Joshua 12. They had seen the walls of Jericho come a-tumbling down (Joshua 6), then watched as the Lord stopped the sun in its track for an entire day and rained hailstones down on their enemies (Joshua 10). God had kept His promises to defeat Israel’s enemies and clear the path for them to enter into the promised land. But there were still many battles left to fight, “still very large areas of land to be taken over” (Joshua 13:1). \n\nI so often see myself in the stories of God’s people as they wandered. Like me, they were a wimpy-hearted bunch, prone to discouragement, defeat, and despair. Despite God’s unbroken track record, their confidence was easily shaken. \n\nSo here, in Joshua 12, we find a roll call of the kept promises of God: a list of the kings God’s people had conquered, the lands they’d captured. Each one is proof of God’s love and provision:\n\nThe king of Jericho, one.\n\nThe king of Ai, one.\n\nThe king of Jerusalem, one.\n\nThe king of Hebron, one…\n\nFor 31 kings, the list goes on. Over and over, God came through. There’s not a single example of Him dropping the ball. It was God’s track record, not their own, that emboldened God’s people to keep fighting, to keep walking toward the land they’d been promised. \n\nIt’s hard for fickle folks like us to fully grasp, but God is the promise keeper. Failing to come through is not in His nature. His faithfulness gives us the courage to keep moving forward, pressing on toward the prize (Philippians 3:13-14). And as we march toward the promised land, we can rest assured that He will keep His promises still. \n\nEvery. Single. One. \n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Joshua 13:1-33, Joshua 14:1-15, 2 Peter 3:13, Romans 4:13-17\n\nI grew up on old church hymns. I have vivid memories of me as a child and then a teenager, turning a purple hardcover hymnal to the page number specified in the bulletin. Sunday mornings and Sunday nights, donning a dress or jeans, I’d stand up straight in the pew and sing loud the songs that would become the sounds of my faith—my confession in a melody of sharps and flats (sung mostly on key).\n\nWhen I read the conquest and land allotment passages in Joshua, I find myself humming “Victory in Jesus” and remembering the pages of that hymnal. It’s a boisterous hymn—at least, our rendition was. The combination of the pounding piano chords and reverberating notes from the pipe organ made me lift my head a little higher and belt out Eugene Bartlett’s chorus a little louder. \n\nO victory in Jesus,\n\nMy Savior, forever.\n\nHe sought me and bought me\n\nWith His redeeming blood;\n\nHe loved me ere I knew Him\n\nAnd all my love is due Him,\n\nHe plunged me to victory,\n\nBeneath the cleansing flood.\n\nIt felt, well, victorious. The irony is that the actions expressed in these lyrics sound less like conquest and more like surrender. Being “sought” and “bought” and “plunged” into a flood is not congruent with my idea of winning. But in the gospel of Jesus, that’s exactly what it is. To be conquered by the grace of God is to be victorious.\n\nThe list of land divisions in Joshua 13 is more than just a test of our Old Testament pronunciation skills (a test I would fail with flying colors); it is a testimony to the precise, complete, and gracious fulfillment of God’s promise to Israel. Like every other promise God makes to His children, the boundaries described for each tribe were both fixed and fulfilled by God.  \n\nBut there’s even more to see here than the staggering detail with which the book describes the physical, promised land God gave Israel. Notice the phrasing used throughout chapters 13 and 14 for each portion of land. This land is their inheritance. It is a gift from the Lord, not based on merit but on identity. \n\nThe Israelites gained the land through conquest, but only with the one true God at the helm. Joshua’s people took the land, but only with the Lord of lords supplying the strength. This promised land was fulfilled because God secured it long ago as an inheritance for His children. The same is true of our eternal inheritance—our salvation.\n\nClifford in Shakespeare’s Henry VI declares, “God on our side, doubt not of victory!” And he was right. But this victory does not always look like we think it should. To be victorious in the Lord is to surrender what little might we have to the almighty One. To “win for Jesus” means losing ourselves in the flood of His forgiveness and grace.  \n\nWe are His children, His people, and He has granted us His very identity, sealed for us in Christ (Galatians 3:29). The new heavens and new earth are not yet ours to inhabit, but according to 2 Peter 3:13, the promise is ours now. The victory has been secured and the allotment has been assigned. \n\nYou and I don’t yet dwell in the new heavens with Christ. This fallen world we’re living in will never have the permanent “rest from war” we’ll enjoy in the new earth (Joshua 14:15). But Jesus dwells here with us—through the already-fulfilled promise of His Holy Spirit (John 14:26). “He is the down payment of our inheritance, for the redemption of the possession, to the praise of His glory” (Ephesians 1:14).\n\nThanks be to the Almighty God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Joshua 15:1-63, Joshua 16:1-10, 1 Peter 1:3-5, John 10:7-18\n\nGrowing up, Judah’s prospects looked pretty dim. Dysfunction? His family had it in spades. With all that family drama, it’s no wonder Judah ran away. Nor is it surprising that his problems continued to follow him. \n\nAfter marrying and having three sons of his own, the generational sin and chaos just perpetuated. Scripture tells us the first two were wicked and died young. The remaining son refused to care for his brother’s widow, Tamar; and while Judah was also responsible for her welfare, he refused to act on her behalf (Genesis 38:6-11). Eventually, Tamar used deceit to force his hand. Would Judah honor his responsibilities or run from them once again?\n\nWhen we look at Judah’s background, the answer seems obvious: Judah is not one of the “good guys.” He comes from one sinful mess and jumps right into another. Isn’t his course already set?\n\nThank God, the answer to that question is a resounding NO. Redemption is a constant refrain in the Bible: Your past does not define you (see Rahab). Your sin does not define you (see King David). Your family does not define you (see Ruth). Because of God’s love and mercy, Jesus Christ defines you. He calls you by name, and you are His (Isaiah 43:1). He alone created us, loves us perfectly, and saves us from our sin.\n\nJudah was not doomed by his past any more than you or me. God had great plans for him—plans to open his eyes to his own sinfulness (Genesis 38:26), plans to give him a new heart that could love well (Ezekiel 36:26), and even plans to reconcile his family and turn it into a great nation (Genesis 12:2). \n\nTamar’s trap became the turning point in Judah’s life. After he chose to take care of her, Judah returned to his father’s household, but this time as a sacrificial leader. By the time Judah received a final word from his father, it was a prophetic blessing: the future for his descendants would be long and bright (Genesis 49:10). This is the blessing we see unfolding in Joshua 15. Judah had become a tribe numbering in the thousands, and that tribe had arrived at the promised land to receive its inheritance.\n\nIn Ephesians, Paul wrote that God “is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us” (Ephesians 3:20). Do we really believe that? Or do we think it’s too late for us? Deep down, have we believed the lie that there are places God’s redemptive grasp can’t reach? \n\nWhen you feel stuck in dysfunction, or hounded by your past, remember Who defined Judah and his future. The tribe of Judah brought forth Jesus Christ, the “Lion of Judah” and the anchor of our true identity (John 1:12-13). He has an eternal inheritance for us beyond what we can imagine.\n\nCarolyn Denny dabbled in the Navy, politics, business, and publishing before she discovered her true calling: household management.

Sleeping in my own bed, waking up to my own coffeemaker, hearing the familiar hum of traffic outside my window—home is truly a restful reprieve.\n\nIn Joshua chapter 18, we see a new home established for the nation of Israel at Shiloh: “Now the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of meeting there. And the land was subdued before them” (Joshua 18:1).\n\nThe tabernacle was the physical manifestation of God’s presence among His people. He dwelled in the innermost part of it, the holy of holies. In the midst of dividing territory and separating themselves physically from one another, it’s significant that the Israelites—all of the Israelites—now gathered in this one place to be in the presence of the Lord. God was the center, the core, of this people. And Shiloh would be His resting place for the next 300 years, until the Israelites were defeated by the Philistines.\n\nWhen I looked up “Shiloh” in Hebrew, I came across a couple of definitions. One was “a place of rest” and the other, “peace.”\n\nI don’t know that we can fully understand how the Israelites must have felt to finally settle and put down roots after years and years of traveling as nomads. An entire generation had been born and raised on foot, a generation that didn’t know what it meant to have a home—to have something to return to, a place to rest.\n\nThis is something we all understand: to have wandered far and long, to be weary and tired and thirsty, to desire peace—real peace. We all desire a place to call home.\n\nWhat this scene at Shiloh points us to is the place we, as Christians, now find our rest. “But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands. Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption” (Hebrews 9:11-12).\n\nThe atonement for our sin that was once achieved through sacrifice and ritual in the tabernacle, is now complete through Christ’s blood. He entered the Most Holy Place once, and for all. For me and for you. \n\nJesus is our Shiloh.\n\nAre you weary? “Come to Me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28).\n\nAre you thirsty? “Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty again” (John 4:14).\n\nAre you hungry? “I am the bread of life… No one who comes to Me will ever be hungry” (John 6:35).\n\nAre you restless? “Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7).\n\nIn Christ, we have rest and reprieve. In Christ, we have a home. \n\nLet us gather at Shiloh today and rest in that truth.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Joshua 19:1-51, Genesis 49:1-28, Acts 13:16-25\n\nI was 10 or 11 years old when I first read Little Women. In the years before I opened that book, I thought reading and writing were “school” activities. I wrote stories because my teacher required it, not because I actually liked it. But Louisa May Alcott changed all that. She awakened something inside me, and I wanted in. So I pulled a blank notebook out of my desk, and I scribbled a story inside it.\n\nSince then, my heart has drawn ever deeper into writing. Writing about God’s Word, and teaching it to others, makes my soul sing. I’m certain it’s the thing I was created to do.\n\nHowever, it hasn’t always come easily. Around the time I dove headfirst into writing, God called me back to school. It felt like an obstacle to my dream, but not an insurmountable one, so I pressed on. Then, I got pregnant and had a baby. Then I got pregnant again and had another baby. All while I was still in school.\n\nBetween school and marriage and parenting, my attention was pulled in a lot of directions, and it wasn’t long before writing got put on the backburner. All the while, I watched as my writing friends achieved their own goals. One by one, they grew their ministries and published books, while I was lucky to steal an hour to write. My friends had reached the promised land, while I remained just outside it.\n\nWaiting is always hard, but it is made especially difficult by comparison. When your friends or colleagues attain the thing you want, it’s tough to hold on to contentment. The ache is somehow heightened by the sight of another’s success.\n\nWhen I read the story of Joshua, I wonder if he knew this ache. A skilled, lifelong warrior, Joshua wasn’t appointed to lead Israel until he was 90 years old. Then, he spent another decade guiding the Israelites into the promised land. After he accomplished all that, he dispensed the land to the twelve tribes of Israel. Only at the very end of the journey, and the very end of his life, after everyone else had received their inheritance, did Joshua receive his (Joshua 19:49-50). \n\nJoshua waited a lot, and I wonder how the story might have been different had he been guided by impatience. I wonder how his leadership might have been compromised had his spirit been discontent. Thankfully, Joshua succumbed to neither. He was a man who waited well. Rather than pine for the life he wanted, Joshua made himself available to the will of God. His waiting was both active and fruitful. \n\nI suspect Joshua did all this because he trusted God’s promises. He knew God would make good on His Word because He always does. From the start, God told Joshua what would be required to endure this particular journey: “Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them” (Joshua 1:6).\n\nGod always comes through. This was a truth that guarded the integrity of Joshua’s leadership. God promised to be with Joshua, to bring him success wherever he went (Joshua 1:7,9), and that’s just what He did. By trusting in God’s perfect timing, Joshua accomplished a lot through his waiting.\n\nThe story of Joshua reminds us that we don’t have to despair in the waiting. God’s promises are trustworthy, His plans are precise, and His timing is perfect—which means waiting isn’t a setback. It’s an opportunity. \n\nDon’t waste your waiting. Your story is much bigger than the ending.\n\n\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, and mom of two boys.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Missy Fuller\n\nText: Joshua 20:1-9, Joshua 21:1-45, Exodus 21:12-14, Hebrews 2:14-15\n\nThe nation of Israel had been through a lot. \n\nThey conquered the land of Canaan, driving out existing nations and taking over the land. They crossed the raging Jordan River. Before that, they wandered in the desert for 40 years, waiting for God to signal when it was time to move. And before that, they were a nation of slaves, living in Egypt under hardship and oppression.\n\nYet God had His hand in all of it, like He does in our lives. In Genesis 15, God made a covenant promise to Abraham, spelling out exactly what would happen to his descendants.\n\nGod promised that Abraham would have numerous offspring. He kept that promise. The Israelites multiplied more and more the longer the Egyptians oppressed them (Exodus 1:12). \n\nGod promised Abraham that his descendants would be enslaved for 400 years. And they were. The Egyptians worked the Israelites ruthlessly and made their lives bitter (Exodus 1:13-14). \n\nGod also promised to judge the nation the Israelites served. Indeed, the Angel of the Lord killed all the firstborn of Egypt and passed judgment against the gods of Egypt (Exodus 12:12).\n\nGod promised that His people would leave the nation they served with overwhelming possessions. And they did. The Egyptians gave the Israelites silver, gold jewelry, and clothing as they left Egypt (Exodus 12:35-36).\n\nFinally, God promised to bring Abraham’s descendants back to the promised land. In Joshua, we see God drive out the inhabitants of Canaan and give the land to Israel (Joshua 21:43-44).\n\nWe serve the same God today. He makes promises to us as His children, just as He made promises to the house of Israel.\n\nHe will meet all our needs (Philippians 4:19).\n\nHe will provide for us (Matthew 6:33).\n\nHe will never leave us or forsake us (Deuteronomy 31:8).\n\nHe has a purpose for us (Romans 8:28).\n\nRemembering God’s faithfulness in our past helps us cling to His promises in our present. When I struggle to believe that He will provide for my needs, I remember how He provided that check in the mail at exactly the right moment. When I’m overwhelmed with loneliness, I think of the friendships He’s given me and how He Himself walked through dark moments with me. When I fear condemnation for my sin and mistakes, I recall the ways He’s already redeemed my past.\n\nGod’s promises are our foundation. He fulfills His every word. We can cling to His promises as we wander in the desert and fight the enemy. We can count on Him to be fully faithful (Joshua 21:45).\n\n“None of the good promises the Lᴏʀᴅ had made to the house of Israel failed. Everything was fulfilled.”\n\n– Joshua 21:45\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Joshua 22:1-34, 2 Corinthians 1:21-22, Psalm 7:8-11\n\n“I’ve never been asked to play Dixie® Cups before!” said my grandmother… and, well, most people. \n\nIt was my favorite childhood game: stealing the box of mouthwash cups from the bathroom, then dumping its contents onto the table and standing the paper cups to attention. \n\nIt was like playing a game of “Memory”—the object was to find the cup that matched the one in my hand. Except my game was better, because instead of only one possible match, there were probably twenty. Once a match was made, I’d add the pair to my prized, yet toppling, tower of cups. \n\nClearly my game did not require superior memory skills, but that little tower was a comforting sight nonetheless. I loved to remember that the odds were stacked in my favor. I needed to remember that. \n\nThe eastern tribes of Israel needed to remember, too. They’d wandered in the wilderness—twice!—but their journey was also bookended with two miraculous water crossings. As they crossed the Jordan River, they came across giant stones—ones they never would have seen without God making a way for them in the river. Marking each as a promise kept from the Lord, they began to stack them, creating an altar of remembrance. Each river stone said, God brought you out of the wilderness and carried you through this river. Remember this. \n\nThey were just rocks, and yet, they were so much more. Unlike an altar built for idol-worshipping, this was a token shouting out the one true God’s faithfulness, created in His presence and stacked high for all to see. \n\n“It is to be a witness between us and you, and between the generations after us, so that we may carry out the worship of the Lord in His presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fellowship offerings.”\n\n-Joshua 22:27\n\nA witness. The rocks their feet had walked across in obedience also bore witness to the grace of the Father, who makes small things significant and significant things small. \n\nMy Dixie cup towers were small yet significant, too—filled with joy, yet paper and disposable. It would’ve been easy for anyone to assume that my toppling tower was begging to be thrown away, when that wasn’t part of the game at all. Small and significant things are also easily misunderstood. \n\nWhen the western tribes of Israel encountered the eastern tribes’ altars of remembrance, they mistook them for a sign of aggression. They even began preparing for civil war! Oops. They couldn’t have known what the rocks meant. They couldn’t have seen their mistake. The Israelites, like you and I, were trying the best they could! But they were confused. \n\nDon’t worry—the tribes came together to discuss the matter, and fears fizzled as they recalled the Truth they held in common. “Yahweh is the God of gods! Yahweh is the God of gods!” (Joshua 22:22). They remembered what we are learning: The humans in the story may be confused, but the God of the story is sovereign and good. \n\nWhere there is human confusion, Christ is our resolve. Where we build towers, He seals hearts. While we build temporary remembrances of God, He has already created a permanent remembrance within us. “He has also sealed us and given us the Spirit as a down payment in our hearts” (2 Corinthians 1:21-22).\n\nWhether we walk in wilderness, or find a miraculous crossing, or build towers in His name, may we continue to put our trust and hope in God alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Joshua 23:1-16, Joshua 24:1-33, Matthew 11:28-30, Hebrews 4:1-13\n\nEven the greatest leaders die. As Joshua prepared for the end of his life, he addressed Israel—those people of God who had followed him through impossible circumstances to an improbable reward.\n\n“I am now going the way of all the earth, and you know with all your heart and all your soul that none of the good promises the Lord your God made to you has failed. Everything was fulfilled for you; not one promise has failed.”\n\n– Joshua 23:14\n\nIt was time for Joshua to go. In keeping with his steady voice as their leader, Joshua’s farewell address was a plea for Israel to do three things: Remember what God has done. Obey Him courageously and completely. Worship Him alone.\n\nI like to picture the scene as Joshua stood there in front of the tribes, relaying one last message from the Lord. I like to imagine the passion in his voice as he recounted their treacherous journey—how God rescued His people from generations of idol worship and multiplied their descendants, how He rescued them from slavery in Egypt and sustained them in the wilderness, and how He ushered them into the promised land, handing them every victory along the way. This line is my favorite:\n\n“I gave you a land you did not labor for, and cities you did not build, though you live in them; you are eating from vineyards and olive groves you did not plant.”\n\n– Joshua 24:13\n\nThe Lord did it all. And Joshua, with all the earnestness his 110 years could muster, was asking Israel to remember, to obey, and to worship the God of the Rescue.\n\nThis was not a call for arbitrary emotion or passive intention. This request was active and specific. Joshua gave the people instructions specific to their time and circumstance, but his admonition echoes even to us: “You are witnesses against yourselves that you yourselves have chosen to worship Yahweh” (Joshua 24:22). In other words, Don’t just say this. Mean it. Do it.\n\n“We are witnesses,” they said back to him.\n\n“Then get rid of the foreign gods that are among you and offer your hearts to the Lord, the God of Israel” (v. 23).\n\nI like Joshua’s style: “Okay then. Get on with it.”\n\nJoshua was a good leader. But even he did not perfectly fulfill the promises he solicited from the people. Even Joshua was a sinner in need of a savior. He was used by the Lord to secure a tangible inheritance for his people. But, like Joshua himself, that inheritance was only temporary. The rest from war would not last. \n\nNot even Joshua could bring God’s people salvation.\n\nJoshua couldn’t, but Jesus did.\n\nJesus obeyed perfectly and followed the Father faithfully. And when we did not and could not? Jesus satisfied God’s wrath for our sin and granted us the eternal benefit of His perfect obedience (Romans 3:25-26). Jesus has gone ahead of us into the very death that was ours and conquered it on our behalf (2 Timothy 1:10). Christ secured for us an inheritance that is eternal, a rest that will last (Hebrews 4:9).\n\nHere in the last chapters of Joshua, as we look back over the epic story of what God did for His people, we lean in and listen to the wise old man’s words: Remember what God has done. Obey Him courageously and completely. Worship Him alone.\n\nBe faithful to the God of the Rescue. And when your faithfulness fails, lean wholly on the grace of Christ. \n\n",

You may have heard the closing lines referenced in pop culture: “This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper.” \n\nI reread the poem after walking backward and forward through today’s passage in Judges, the final chapter of a brutal journey. We are trained, when reading stories, to settle into a conclusion not long after the climax. We long to be satisfied. The book of Judges doesn’t do that. \n\nEarlier in the poem, Eliot writes:\n\nThe eyes are not here\n\nThere are no eyes here\n\nIn this valley of dying stars\n\nIn this hollow valley\n\nThis broken jaw of our lost kingdoms\n\n… death’s twilight kingdom,\n\nThe hope only\n\nOf empty men.\n\nEliot’s “empty men” are a helpful comparison as we end our study of Judges. The weight and power of Eliot’s words capture, in ways I never could, the heart-wailing of the tribes of Israel. When death is the only hope, we are left in total darkness. \n\nWe know that Jesus is our conquering King, the life and light of men. But Judges doesn’t end with Jesus. Judges ends with a “valley of dying stars,” empty men grasping together at nothing. “In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes” (v. 25). As modern readers, we can read this last verse in Judges and know it’ll all be okay because Jesus is coming. Even though that is true, would you be willing to resist that temptation for closure with me today? \n\nLet us whimper. Let us feel the ache of the ages, the desperation for something we cannot name. The longing for a king that led the Israelites in caustic circles, is the same longing that leads us to fill our lives with stuff that distracts and tries to counteract that epic ache. \n\nThe inclination to grasp at goodness is the right response to reading the book of Judges. Our hearts are magnetized to light, not darkness. Judges provokes that tension in us, leaving us with an unsettled feeling. It is a historical book, a true tragedy tucked in the middle of the greatest book ever written. And yet, its darkness is unparalleled. Its darkness makes us crave light. \n\nChiaroscuro is an art technique that utilizes sharp contrasts—light and dark—for dramatic impact. Judges is a book of chiaroscuro. The whole picture of the Bible is made more vibrant, more impactful, more necessary because of these dark corners. We can thank God for the book of Judges, and we can thank Him for wiring our hearts to long for the goodness and light that only He provides.\n\nMelanie Rainer is a bookworm from birth who makes her days writing, editing, and reading in Nashville, where she also joyfully serves as the editor of Kids Read Truth.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 20:1-48, Deuteronomy 18:1-5, Proverbs 16:33\n\nIt all started with a little boy and itchy skin, which is honestly the worst way for anything to begin. He was my little brother, two years old at the time, and as the scratching continued, it became clear the cause was more than an irritation from running around in the grass or an aggravated mosquito bite. Still, my parents applied Cortisone cream and hoped for the best, leaving a message for the pediatrician to call in the morning.\n\nBut overnight, I, too, began to scratch my skin, and red bumps proved the cause to be more than an allergy to something we’d eaten for dinner the night before. By morning, my mom was also itchy, the final straw to explain our fate: chicken pox.\n\nSo there we were, all three of us, left to schedule back-to-back oatmeal baths, share anti-itch cream, take turns complaining, and inconvenience our one remaining caretaker, my father. To think this all started with a little boy and itchy skin.\n\nIsrael was quick to assume sin was a “someone else” problem, and if I’m being honest, I’m often guilty of doing the same. The crime at Gibeah? Certainly it was someone else’s fault. Surely, the people of Benjamin were the only ones who didn’t have it all together, and war needed to be waged against them to make everything right.\n\nBut first, God used the war against Benjamin to point out the ways Israel, too, was infected with sin. While these accounts are difficult to take in and unfold like a horror story, they all play a part in God reminding His children what happens when they forget Him and rely only on what they can see. Everyone was doing what appeared to be right in their own eyes, and that lead to death and destruction. \n\nThe Israelites first defeat at the hands of the badly outnumbered Benjaminites caused them to weep before the Lord and inquire of Him if they should attack again the next day. It wasn’t until their second failure that they turned to fasting and making sacrifices for their sins. It’s dangerous to keep on living in sickness, but unfortunately, many times it takes something truly terrible to recognize the destructiveness of sin.\n\nChapter 20 of Judges isn’t necessarily something you’d want to write on your dry erase board or commit to needlepoint, but it’s significant to the heartbeat of humanity. It’s been said that sometimes, to receive the depth of the good news, we must first be able to swallow the bad. And yet, here is my favorite part of this passage: God answered the Israelites, despite their sin. When they asked questions, no matter how infected their souls were, He answered. And that is the God we serve. \n\nWe may waver from Him and, for a time, commit to our own selfish ways, but by the grace of God, His commitment is to the changing of hearts. Our stories will all end with our sinful selves redeemed by the faithful Father. Thanks be to Him.\n\nKaitlin Wernet is a twenty-something who lives to tell stories with a backbone of hope.

    "devo_title": "Outrage in Benjamin",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nEditor’s Note: Some passages in Judges deal in subject matter that might be especially painful for some readers. Though many of the wounds we receive in this life are deeply personal and unimaginably painful, when they appear in God’s Word, we are reminded that He sees them. Whenever sin is addressed in Scripture—whether through teaching or story—it comes to us in the context of God’s unwavering commitment to bring an end to all evil in this world through the finished work of Christ (Revelation 21:3-4). We are praying for and with you as you read.\n\n//\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 19:1-30, Jeremiah 8:18-9:3, 2 Corinthians 6:14-18\n\nThis is dark. I don’t like to think about horrible things. And I would like to think this story has nothing to do with me. Because I am A) not a terrorizer of women, B) not a concubine, and C) not a murderer. So I would like to be excused from this exercise and come back when we are talking about the wonderful grace of Jesus instead. Or maybe we could (please!) gloss over this and talk about how heaven will be paved with streets of gold. I’m here for all of that. \n\nBut perhaps we could be brave and try to look at this Judges 19 passage together.\n\nFirst, before we get too angry with the Levite for having a concubine in the first place, let’s consider what some scholars have to say about her: the concubine was probably the Levite’s wife, but was called a “concubine” because she was not endowed with a dowry. Either way, it looks like she was unfaithful to him and left him. \n\nThe delay caused by all the over-politeness in the house of her father meant that they stayed longer and later than intended. When they finally arrive in an Israelite city, there is only one man willing to take them in. Just as Lot was the only hospitable man in Sodom (Genesis 19:1–29), this old Ephraimite is the only refuge in Gibeah.\n\nThe men of Gibeah, like the men of Sodom, surrounded the house and sought to do great wickedness to the guests. The old Ephraimite, like Lot, offered a wicked substitution to preserve the Levite: he offered up his own daughter and the Levite’s concubine. The men of Gibeah took only the concubine, but abused her to death that night.\n\nThe Levite’s role that night seems to be one of passivity and cowardice. It is unclear how his action or inaction enter into the matter, although it seems his “eating and drinking” in this story are twice his undoing: first in delaying his departure from the house of her father, and second, in occupying him on this night of the wickedness of Gibeah.\n\nIn the morning, when he exited the house, he found his concubine on the steps, seemingly asleep. But when he found her to be dead, he took her up, returned home, and then sent out his bloody message to the chiefs of Israel, a testimony of the wickedness of Gibeah.\n\nThe Bible is brief and thrifty in its narratives. As with so much of Scripture, it comes to us in parables, in examples, often without explicit explanation of what we are to take away from it all. This passage, however, seems to give us direct instruction: “Think it over, discuss it, and speak up!” (Judges 19:30).\n\nWe are to be broken by the brokenness of this world, but not only of the world. We are to be broken by the brokenness of the Church, of God’s own people, of ourselves, and our own hearts (Jeremiah 8:21). Consider how profound a warning this story is against our passivity toward sin. Any sin, left to itself, can end in horrors unthinkable. \n\nMay we be broken over our own sin, over the sins of our people, and in the world! May Christ have mercy on us. May He deal kindly and gently with us, and give not to us as our sins deserve, but preserve us by His good will.\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her five little people.

Despite the warning, I kept watching and hoping the show’s main characters, three orphans, would eventually find relief. Each episode ended in dismay as the orphans’ lives spiraled further out of control. The story became more tragic at every turn. As I read Judges 18, the same theme song crept into the back of my mind: “Just look away, look away… ”\n\nIsrael’s story took dark turn after dark turn, as the people made bad choice after bad choice. Redeemed out of slavery, all their needs were taken care of by the Lord, yet they forgot their God and lost their way. Quickly they fell into sin and idolatry. We’re talking idol worship, murder, absolute lawlessness. How could God’s chosen people fall so far so fast?\n\nFrom the outside looking in, the Israelites’ missteps are plain to see. But in our own lives, it’s much easier to lose perspective. The Israelites thought they could run their lives better than God could. For example, we saw in today’s reading that God provided land for the tribe of the Danites, but they found a quiet town to conquer instead. Veering from God’s provision, they left behind a wake of physical and spiritual destruction. The Lord also asked the Israelites for their sole devotion, but the Danites opted for idol worship in instead (Judges 18:27–31).  \n\nThe Danites, a tribe of Israel, thought they could make a better, happier, more abundant future for themselves than the one the Lord had laid out for them. Sometimes I wonder, Am I guilty of this sort of arrogance too? Do I ever believe my plan is superior to the Lord’s? When I forget the goodness and wisdom of God, I’m likely to fall into the same trap of disobedience, foolishly thinking I can create a brighter future for myself than the one God has planned.\n\nWe choose our own plans because we don’t trust God’s plan is actually good for us. Or maybe, like the Danites, we forget that our God has the power to move mountains. Perhaps God calls us to give our money or time or energy, but we hold back. Or maybe He lays it on our hearts to repair a relationship, but we decide it’s better to sweep the issue under the rug. In the short term, we think our plan is less painful, more effective. But if we look at what happened with Israel when they forgot God’s instruction, it’s clear that a life of disobedience only brings pain and suffering.\n\nMay the Danites’ story remind us that we are all utterly lost without God’s guidance. We have access to God’s wisdom in Word and Spirit. Our Father in heaven knows what is best for us and works for our good. Placing our trust in the Lord and obeying Him will not always be easy, but we have a powerful promise of true life, flourishing, and full of purpose when we look to Jesus and walk in His ways.\n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 17:1-13, Leviticus 26:1, Hosea 11:1-12, James 3:9-12\n\nSometimes idolatry is easy to identify. For instance, when I find myself wanting to be more like my favorite Instagram celebrity than Jesus, I know I am idolizing the Instagram celebrity. Or, when I start prioritizing my body image over my spiritual health and well-being, I know I am idolizing how I look. But idolatry can also be stealthy, especially when it is disguised as piety. This is certainly the case for Micah, his shrines, and his priests.\n\nMicah’s story is a slow progression down a dangerous path. It begins with an offering to the Lord—the silver he had stolen from his mother. However, part of the offering is melted down and formed into an idol, something strictly forbidden by Hebrew law (Leviticus 26:1). This idol is then joined by other idols and set up as a shrine in Micah’s household. Micah even makes an ephod, which was a garment worn only by priests, and installs one of his sons as a priest to oversee the shrine.\n\nSlowly but surely, we see what Micah is doing: he is turning his home into a tabernacle. The transformation is complete when a young Levite shows up at his door. “Stay with me,” invites Micah, “and be my father and priest” (Judges 17:10). And the Levite stays, legitimizing Micah’s efforts. Then Micah says, “Now I know that the Lord will be good to me, because a Levite has become my priest” (v.13).\n\nThe elements are there—a priest from the appropriate tribe, the priestly garments, an offering of silver to the Lord—but Micah’s heart exposes his transactional relationship with God, and these motives reveal his idolatry: Now I know the Lord will be good to me.\n\nIdolatry in the name of the Lord is often the hardest to spot and the most destructive. I can easily idolize my religion over my Savior. I can lose trust in the promise of Christ and begin trusting in my church attendance or how often I volunteer or read Scripture. These rituals in and of themselves are good, but they are meant as an avenue to commune with God, not to be my own god. What often begins as an attempt to be near God can put distance between my heart and His.  \n\nMicah did not need to turn his home into a tabernacle and his family into priests, because God was already dwelling among the Israelites. In the same way, I don’t have to idolize my religion in an attempt to be nearer to God because He has already come near to me through the person of Jesus Christ, and He remains with me by the Holy Spirit.  \n\nMicah’s story proves that the line is fine between being active participants in our religion and idolizing it. What starts as piety can quickly slip into idolatry if we’re not careful. And in our attempt to be closer to God, we actually end up turning away from true and intimate relationship with Him.\n\nMay I heed the warning in Micah’s story and honestly examine my heart: Do I worship my religion, or do I worship the Lord, my God? \n\nAndrea Lucado is a freelance writer, Texas native, and the author of the memoir English Lessons: The Crooked Path of Growing Toward Faith.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 16:1-31, Jeremiah 15:15–16, Hebrews 11:32–38\n\nIt’s hard to know how to feel about Samson. Sure, he’s listed among the judges of Israel and later manages a nod in the Hebrews “Hall of Faith” (chapter 11). But every time I read his story, I scratch my head and wonder, Why?\n\nAfter all, he did sleep with prostitutes (Judges 16:1). His affair with Delilah was so toxic it reads like an episode of a certain popular dating reality TV series (vv. 4–20). He seems both arrogant and unwise, not exactly typical “man of God” material—not to mention all the killing. Isolated as a stand-alone narrative, this one feels like an outlier. But the flawed character of Samson (and the rest of the judges) is merely a lower layer of a greater story.\n\nThe heroes of our faith didn’t secure their status through flawless holiness. Every judge, every prophet, every disciple, and every deliverer had the same broken nature we do. From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible is the story of the most ragtag, rebellious, disappointing disciples imaginable—unless the story is not about them at all.\n\nThe stories of the judges of Israel, including Samson, and the stories of our own broken lives are merely footnotes in the bigger story—the story of a God who redeems, restores, and uses everything for our good and His glory.\n\nInstead of trying to convince ourselves that Samson is a worthy hero, we ought to let his flaws and failures remind us of the true Judge (Matthew 25:31–46), who rescues God’s people perfectly. Like a prism, let us hold Samson’s story up to the light, looking for the truth of who God is.\n\nSamson loved an undeserving woman who eventually betrayed him.\n\nJesus loves the bride of Christ, the Church, despite our long history of running from Him into the arms of other lovers.\n\nSamson was betrayed for a few pieces of silver.\n\nJesus was betrayed for an even lower price, His monetary value even less than a lustful, violent Nazarite.\n\nSamson was bound, humiliated, and tormented by the Philistines (Judges 16:19-21).\n\nJesus endured even worse for our sake (Isaiah 53).\n\nSamson’s enemies rejoiced too soon. The battle was not yet over. So must it have been with the powers of darkness, as Jesus lay dead and lifeless in a borrowed tomb. But just as Samson would rise again to bring down the house of his enemies, Jesus would rise from the grave on the third day to bring down the house on sin and death. Samson secured a limited and scandalous legacy (Judges 16:31). Not Jesus! He ripped history in two. Samson died among his enemies in a heap of rubble, while Jesus kept His promise that when His enemies tore down the temple, He would rebuild it in three days (John 2:19).\n\nSamson is a flawed frontrunner to our true Savior; therefore, Samson’s story is worth reading because it points to Someone so much better. God has provided something infinitely better for us in Jesus Christ (Hebrews 11:39–40), and because of Him, sin and death have been defeated once and for all (Romans 6:10).\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 15:1-20, Psalm 106:40-48, Isaiah 40:27-31\n\nGoodness, things just keep getting worse. \n\nReading Samson’s life story feels like watching a particularly dark television series. Death and destruction follow him everywhere he goes. In Judges 15, Samson sets fire to the tails of 300 foxes and sets the Philistines’ farmland and vineyards ablaze. His wife and father-in-law are burned to death in a gruesome retaliation. Men are ripped limb from limb. And when it’s all said and done, Samson, infused with the Spirit of the Lord, single-handedly kills 1,000 men with the jawbone of a donkey (Judges 15:16).\n\nWhat in the world is going on here? \n\nIt’s important to remember that in the midst of this bloody, heartbreaking story, God is still present, and that He has endowed Samson with great strength and fervor in order to free the Israelites from the Philistines. It’s also important to remember that redemption is never clean and simple. It is a bloody business. Samson is caught in a web of back-and-forth retaliation, and he knows in his heart that in the end, it is his job to rid the Israelites of their oppressors. \n\nWhen the Israelites find Samson hiding out in a cave, they do not join him to fight the way the Israelites have done in the past. No, they bind him and hand him over to the enemy. They cower. They see his strength, but they do not see him as a savior. Instead of recognizing Samson as a deliverer, they hand him over to the Philistines, bound and ready for death. But Samson inflicts justice on the Philistines through this small, weak weapon: the jawbone of a donkey. It is an unexpected, bloody redemption.\n\nDoes this story sound familiar at all? \n\nMany years after the time of the judges, God sent the Israelites a Savior who is one with God and full of the Spirit (John 1:1–18; Luke 3:21–22). Rather than recognize His strength, the Israelites handed Jesus over to their oppressors and Pontius Pilate to be crucified.\n\nBut this time—this final time—the blood that was shed was not of the enemy. God turned the story on its head. Rather than kill off the Romans, Jesus went to the cross willingly to shed His own blood for us. It is an unexpected, bloody redemption. \n\nThanks be to God for saving us from ourselves, our sin, and the schemes of the enemy. May we give thanks to His holy name, and rejoice in praising Him (Psalm 106:47).\n\nClaire Gibson is a writer whose work has been featured in publications including The Washington Post and Entrepreneur Magazine among many others.

We are committed to faithfully reading and presenting God’s Word and appreciate your grace and partnership today.\n\nA number of years ago, I met a famous person I had long respected from afar. This is always a tense experience, isn’t it? Most of us, I think, when we encounter famous people, get nervous to some degree. It happens to me less now than it did before because I have interacted with a number of “famous” Christians through my job. But still, especially when meeting some people, my palms get sweaty. Beyond that tension, I’m afraid that when I meet a famous person he or she is not going to be nice. Meeting someone we admire only to learn he or she is human is disorienting and disappointing.\n\nIn Judges 14, we continue to read about Samson, a judge appointed by God, a distinguished leader of God’s people, and a massive disappointment. We have already been exposed to Samson and his background, but it is here in chapter 14 that we see his disobedience. In verses 1–4, Samson disobeys the will of his parents and seeks a Philistine woman “because she seemed right to [him]”  (v. 7). This is a foreshadowing of his weakness. For all his physical strength, for all his natural gifting, he is proving to be weak in character. \n\nSamson shares a riddle with Philistine men at his marriage feast. He will pay them handsomely if they solve the riddle within a week, and they will pay him if they don’t. Because they have trouble solving the riddle, they threaten Samson’s wife, which leads her to squeeze the answer out of him, despite Samson not giving the answer to his mother or father. He loses the bet because his wife gives the Philistine men the answer. This leads Samson to kill thirty other Philistine men in order to pay up his end of the bet.\n\nFlashes of Samson’s strength, reliance on the Spirit of God, and anointing give glimpses of what the true Savior of God’s people, Jesus, would one day look like. Some may have thought Samson would be the deliverer of Israel, but unfortunately, he sought his own way and was undermined by his weakness. \n\nIn Isaiah 11 we read that the Savior of the world would shoot up from the stump of Jesse, in the line of David, and deliver the people of God from their disobedience and weakness. His justice would be righteous because His wisdom is from above. Jesus, our perfect Judge (Matthew 25:31-46), “will not judge by what he sees with his eyes, he will not execute justice by what he hears with his ears” (Isaiah 11:3).\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 13:1-25, Numbers 6:1-12, Isaiah 9:6\n\nI have always wanted to need glasses. While my peers growing up feared being called “four eyes” as a result of their impaired vision, I teemed with jealousy over their newest accessory. While I’m, of course, very grateful for my 20/20 vision, I secretly fear reading glasses will no longer be in style when I actually (fingers crossed) need them one day. \n\nWhen it comes to this life, I think we all secretly hope that there’s more than meets the eye, that we aren’t quite seeing the full truth just yet. When we experience pain we don’t understand and our circumstances don’t turn out the way we’d hoped, we try to analyze things from all angles. How did this happen? Did I miss something? How could I have avoided all this suffering? Wouldn’t it be a huge relief to look through a viewfinder and have someone adjust things until they appear more clearly, until we’re able to make sense of what we see?\n\nThe gospel is the viewfinder through which all things make sense. Sin has damaged our vision for God’s goodness and plan, making it impossible for us to see with clarity until He removes the veils from our eyes in the heavenly realm. Then we will see the details that go into God’s promise to make all things new. Only then will we begin to fathom the lengths to which He’s gone to keep His promises. But until that time, life on earth is full of hoping and longing, and the occasional glimpse into God’s bigger story at play.\n\nAll throughout the book of Judges, it’s obvious that Israel is blinded by their own sin. In fact, this ominous phrase occurs for the seventh time in today’s reading: “The Israelites again did what was evil in the Lord’s sight” (Judges 13:1). Israel had come to trust only what their own eyes could see.\n\nImagine the surprise Manoah and his wife must have felt when, after years of barrenness, the angel of the Lord announced that they would have a son. It’s doubtful they saw this blessed, yet baffling, news coming. Many questions followed: How can this be? What will the boy’s responsibilities and work be? What is this angel’s name, who has brought us this great news? While they didn’t receive answers to those questions, the angel’s instruction made it clear that this son was to be set apart and “holy to the LORD during the time of consecration” (Numbers 6:8).\n\nClearly, there was more at work than what their human eyes could see. Samson’s impending birth was an introduction to the birth of new possibilities they never could have dreamt up for themselves, an unexpected form of redemption, bringing God’s heart a little more into focus. As God’s children, this is where we can settle our trust: Christ’s coming keeps us focused on hope. Even if all the other details of life seem blurry and unknown, we know we can put our trust in Him. May we view this story and our own as just a small piece of the grander reality of God’s great plan for His people. \n\nKaitlin Wernet is a twenty-something who lives to tell stories with a backbone of hope.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 12:1-15, 1 Samuel 8:19-22, Ecclesiastes 5:4-7\n\nJephthah’s life is starting to unravel. Because of his rash vow, his daughter is dead and his family is broken. Jephthah was wrong to make that vow, and he was wrong to keep it. Because he was called into leadership by men instead of being raised up by God, he was man’s solution to a problem that can only be solved by God. And now, after a seemingly great victory over the Ammonites, the Ephraimites are pounding at his door and threatening to burn his house down over a ridiculous tiff.\n\nIronically, Jephthah’s house is really already on fire by the time the Ephraimites come for him, sharpening their flints. And the fire that burned was kindled by Jephthah’s very own hands and lips. It was the destructive fire of his sin. And he couldn’t keep the smoldering smoke a secret for long.\n\nThe Ephraimites have no good reason to pick a fight with Jephthah. They are angry because he didn’t summon them to help fight the Ammonites. Since he had been called to leadership by the Gileadites, Jephthah really had no authority to summon the tribe of Ephraim to war in the first place. But once they Jephthah is victorious over the Ammonites, they want a piece of that juicy victory and rise up against Jephthah.\n\nIn Shakespeare’s epic tragedy, Hamlet, Queen Gertrude groans, “When sorrows come, they come not as single spies, but in battalions.” In the same way, as Jephthah’s sins pile up, he continues to trudge forward in his own strength, his wrongs and sorrows compounding. Before he knows it, his own house is in shambles. A threat from foreigners to burn his house down is laughable because he has already burned what is valuable with his own actions. No amount of water could douse the flames ignited by the murder of his own daughter. This sin that was closest to his heart ended his career. His time as a judge was over. Jephthah was so burned by the evil that cauterized his family, he could not recover.\n\nOur darkest and most burning sins damage us in profound ways. But hope is never lost. Sometimes fire is the severe mercy we require. “This third I will put into the fire; I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will call on my name and I will answer them; I will say, ‘They are my people,’ and they will say, ‘The Lord is our God’” (Zechariah 13:9). Even if the house of your heart is on fire, call on His name and He will answer you.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 11:1-40, Leviticus 18:21, Leviticus 20:2-5, Matthew 5:34-37\n\nWhen God delivers His people, He “raises up” a deliverer to lead them. Take Moses and Gideon (Exodus 9:16; Judges 6:12), Othniel and Samuel (Judges 3:9; 1 Samuel 2:35), Jeroboam and Cyrus (1 Kings 14:7; Isaiah 45:13), and of course, Jesus (Jeremiah 23:5)—just to name a few.\n\nBut when we read about these deliverers in Scripture, we see that God’s people were often impatient, just like we so often are. And so instead of waiting for God to raise up a leader of His choosing for them, they would drudge up their own. They sought out their own solutions instead of seeking God’s perfect will. \n\nThat’s what’s happening in this passage with Jephthah. God didn’t raise up Jephthah to be Israel’s leader.  Instead Jephthah, who had surrounded himself with worthless men (Judges 11:3), got the call to lead from the elders. He wasn’t raised up by God—he was urged to leadership by men who were gripped with fear and desperation.\n\nThat should have been their first red flag: the desire to circumvent God’s way of doing things. David later explained it this way, “Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain” (Psalm 127:1). But it’s hard to wait on God, and it seems much easier to just get on with our own solutions. However, apart from God, our own solutions can go terrifically wrong. But God is also kind, and He often forestalls judgment as we find our way back to Him.\n\nJephthah wasn’t a totally bad guy. He knew the Scriptures, and he knew the history of Israel. He tried to get the land back and reclaim Israel’s territories. But, like you and me, while Jephthah loved goodness and sought to do right, he also had some sneaky, low-dealing tendencies.\n\nThe combination of human error and ignoring God’s way brings us to Jephthah’s horrifically rash vow. I don’t know if human sacrifice was on his mind when he made the extravagant promise, or why he persisted in carrying out the vow after he realized his daughter would be its victim. But it’s a chilling image of what can happen when a people ignore God’s way and stubbornly turn away from His principles. Jephthah took his bad promise too far, and a celebration was turned into a funeral.\n\nMay the Lord protect our hearts from rushing to do things—even good things—our own way and on our own terms. May He give us courage to relent and humility to repent when we make bad decisions. May we lean on His strength and His promises, not our own, and may our “yes” mean “yes,” and our “no” mean “no” (Matthew 5:36-37). We can stop and turn our hearts toward Him. Even when it seems like we are already too committed to our own way, God waits to lead us back to His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 10:1-18, Isaiah 30:15, Luke 15:11-32\n\nMy mother became a Christian when she was just a few months pregnant with me. I now realize she literally grew in her relationship with Christ while simultaneously teaching and leading me as she learned. In short, I grew up learning a lot about God. I participated in Bible memory contests, collected money for missionaries around the world, and had a part in both Christmas and Easter performances annually. My mother led me the best she knew how, yet I still rebelled.\n\nI knew biblical principles,\n\nbut I did not apply them to my everyday life.\n\nI knew the Bible as God’s Word, that He is the Creator of the universe,\n\nbut I did not honor Him as my Father.\n\nI knew Jesus lived a perfect, holy, and blameless life,\n\nbut I did not know He loves me even though I cannot do the same.\n\nI knew Jesus died to save the world from sin,\n\nbut I did not live as God’s forgiven daughter.\n\nHaving knowledge of God and choosing to live a life that honors Him are two very different things, and they will lead to two very different life experiences. This is exactly what is happening in today’s passage. There is no mistaking that the Israelites knew God. Judges 10:11 reminds us they had experienced His deliverance, His protection, and His love over and over again. Yet time after time they forsook the God they knew, preferring the comforts of what they could see and touch. They chose the false gods and cultural influences of surrounding nations over their faithful God. \n\nOur struggles today remain the same. While we may not be tempted to worship the god of Baal, our false gods are just as dangerous. The tangible items we are so tempted to chase—money, people, success—are just as dishonoring when worshiped in place of the one true God. God did not want the Israelites to simply know of Him. He wanted them to know Him personally, to trust Him, confide in Him, and find their lives in Him. God wants the same for us now; He wants His people to choose Him.  \n\nIt’s easy to look at the stories we read in the Bible and wonder how God’s people could experience His patience, love, and miraculous intervention and yet still put their trust in other things. It’s easy to point the finger in judgment, but it would be far more beneficial for us to reflect on our own idolatry. In doing so, we will likely find places in our own hearts where we need to repent, seeking forgiveness and healing from the God who longs to be gracious to us (Isaiah 30:18). \n\nGod is compassionate and merciful. He provides leadership, guidance, and personal opportunities to experience His love. But as His children, we must take action, choosing to surrender to Him and worship Him with our lives. The ultimate provision of His faithful love comes in the very person of Jesus Christ—the sure image of the invisible God the Israelites so longed for and the Savior we all need. He alone stands by ready to rescue. In our surrender to Him, we will experience the deliverance, forgiveness, compassion, and rest promised to His children (Isaiah 30:15).\n\nIt is with great sadness, yet greater hope still, that we share in the loss of Wynter Pitts, one of our She Reads Truth writers.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 9:1-57, Psalm 68:11-14, John 4:19-24\n\nThe book of Judges is bleak, but chapter 9 is particularly devastating. A passage like this forces us to see the devastation that bad men can wreak. Sometimes the only appropriate response to something like this is, “How long, O Lord?” That is my posture today. \n\nGideon died and the people of Israel once again worshiped Baal, the fake god. When he passed, Gideon left behind seventy (yes, 70) sons. Abimelech was one of those sons, born to a prostitute and bent on being king. So he killed all but one of his brothers (Jotham), and rallied the people of Shechem to make him king. \n\nAbimelech was awful and opportunistic, a greedy and prideful man. Knowing this, Jotham floated him a warning in the form of a parable: A forest of cedar trees wanted a king, and so they asked an olive tree, fig tree, and grape vine to do the job. All three declined, and instead asked the trees of the forest to consider what it would be like to no longer produce the fruit that pleases both people and God. \n\nTurns out the olive tree, fig tree, and grape vine knew their place and their calling; they were content in the roles given to them by the Lord. But the bramble, an opportunistic and destructive plant, said yes—he would be their king (vv. 7–15). One commentary I read compared the bramble to the Southern vine kudzu, which ruthlessly takes over anything in its path. Jotham knew Abimelech would do the same. \n\nGod sought vengeance for the murder of Abimelech’s brothers, sending “an evil spirit between Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem” (v. 22). A man named Gaal started a coup against him, and when Abimelech learned of the plot to overthrow him, he unleashed a violent terror against his people. He “razed the city and sowed it with salt” (v. 45), making it infertile land, destroying it not just for the present, but for generations after. To round out his wrath, he burned a tower filled with people, killing more than a thousand.\n\nAbimelech’s anger would echo for decades. We don’t know exactly how Abimelech salted the earth, but Scripture describes just how destructive this practice might have been, leaving behind soil as a “burning waste of sulfur and salt, unsown, producing nothing, with no plant growing on it” (Deuteronomy 29:23). \n\nThis is the definition of “scorched earth,” a turn-of-phrase typically reserved for military strategies. It is Sherman’s march to the sea in the Civil War and the campaign of Agent Orange in the Vietnam War. It is the devastation we see throughout both history and Scripture. It leaves us to cry out, “How long, O Lord?” \n\nSin has scorched the whole earth, and our whole hearts. It leaves nothing to satisfy us. We are only refreshed, rebuilt, and renewed when we look to Jesus. He is the only One who can water a scorched earth and a hardened heart, and He does. And He will. Thanks be to God. \n\nMelanie Rainer is a bookworm from birth who makes her days writing, editing and reading in Nashville, where she also joyfully serves as the editor of Kids Read Truth.

Why did we start calling the Christian life a “walk” when it is more like a war? After all, “our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this darkness, against evil, spiritual forces in the heavens” (Ephesians 6:12). \n\nYes, we’re the sheep of God’s flock (Psalm 95:7), the tiny chicks He tucks up under His wings (Psalm 91:4) and His dearly loved children (Ephesians 5:1). But these tender images don’t tell the whole story. We are warriors, enlisted for battle against an enemy bent on rebellion against God and the destruction of His image bearers. Truth, peace, faith, and salvation are standard issue armor for Christ’s followers (Ephesians 6:14-17). Why fit us for battle if we’ll never be expected to fight?\n\nIn Judges 8 we find Gideon serving as the general of God’s army. He’s already led the charge in a battle that left the enemy bleeding and scattered (Judges 7:19-25). From our view on the sidelines, we wouldn’t have faulted this band of brothers if they’d simply let the remaining rebels limp away toward the hills. Instead we find them in hot pursuit. The front of darkness had been pushed back, yet they knew the fighting was not over. They were worn out, battle weary, low on energy and strength, and yet they pursued because there was still an enemy at large.\n\nThese words from Gideon’s story have sunk deeply into my gut: “exhausted yet pursuing” (v.4, ESV). They jar me into remembering that for the army of God, the orders haven’t changed. Until Christ returns for us, there will always been skirmishes between flesh and blood, good and evil, light and darkness. There will be times when God’s strength will empower us to push back the front of darkness, but the enemy hasn’t yet raised the flag of surrender. And in the words of Bible teacher Kay Arthur, “There’s no retirement in the time of war.”\n\nAs long as our enemy is on the run and still gunning for the people of God, retirement isn’t an option. Though we may find ourselves weary and worn out from the battle, or celebrating a God-given victory, let us not sit back and rest on our laurels. Let us raise our swords and keep fighting.\n\nFighting for truth.\n\nFighting for hope.\n\nFighting for love.\n\nFighting to make the gospel known.\n\nIn other words, “Let us not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don’t give up” (Galatians 6:9). Until the Lord blasts His trumpet, signaling the final fall of our enemy, may He find us like Gideon’s army—exhausted yet pursuing, and empowered by the strength of our Savior, who “is the power and the wisdom of God” (1 Corinthians 1:24).\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 7:1-25, Isaiah 41:10, Ephesians 6:10\n\nWhen was the last time you were in a battle you could not win without divine intervention?\n\nIt’s hard for me to find an answer. Sure, I enjoy the occasional challenge, but I like to keep those challenges to a minimum, so I can feel capable and in control. And if I’m honest, I’m happy with this life of manageable risks—enough to create some drama, but not so much that it requires great faith. There’s an underlying pride to living like this, because when things go well, I can answer, “Oh that’s easy. I did it myself.”\n\nNews flash: God doesn’t need me, and He doesn’t need you.\n\nI know that sounds harsh, but that’s kind of the point of Judges 7. I wonder if that’s what Gideon told his men that day as they prepared to face down the greatest enemy of their time. “Are you scared? You can leave. God doesn’t need you.” In that one moment, two-thirds of Gideon’s army walked away. Can you imagine? You’re standing there, covered in armor, and the person to your left and your right both leave. The field must have felt very empty. \n\nBut God wasn’t done whittling down the troops. He told Gideon to take his men to the water and split them into “kneelers” and “lappers.” Commentaries disagree about the “How do they drink water?” test; some argue that it was an arbitrary way to narrow down the fighting force quickly, while others wonder if the “lappers” let down their guard. Could it be that God chose to use the most irresponsible men to make the victory that much more miraculous? Regardless, what was a force of more than 30,000 at the beginning of the day had been narrowed to just 300.\n\nWe know how this story ends, but the men in Gideon’s army did not. And as much as God reassured them, on paper it was a suicide mission. This risk didn’t require strength or chariots or better weapons or more “hustle.” It required faith in divine intervention. It required them to rely on God alone, to “be strengthened by the Lord and by his vast strength” (Ephesians 6:10).\n\nThe men who went into the valley needed faith, but the men who were sent away needed it just the same. I can imagine their startled disbelief as Gideon pointed them away from the water. “Wait! We’re the fearless ones! Surely God needs us!” But He didn’t, and those men needed to know where their power came from. For the men who left and the men who went down into the valley, God’s strength combined with their faith led to an epic victory.\n\nGod loves you, but He doesn’t need you. And that isn’t harsh news—it’s freedom. No matter how deep the valley, no matter how big the army you’re up against, He’s not waiting for you to build some spiritual muscle in order to handle that challenge. He already has the strength. All He needs if for you to have faith in Him—whether He’s calling you to face it or walk away.\n\nGideon wasn’t the only warrior who God sent seemingly outnumbered into battle. In the war for our souls, God sent His Son Jesus to take down humanity’s greatest enemy. Jesus went into the valley alone,  voluntarily laying down His life, taking the punishment we deserve, so we could claim His victory over death as our own. This is how strong our God is. Nothing can stand up to Him. Not even death itself.\n\nClaire Gibson is a writer whose work has been featured in publications including The Washington Post and Entrepreneur Magazine among many others.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 6:1-40, Psalm 127:1, James 1:16-17\n\nWhen we read Judges 6, we see that Gideon is certainly having a low moment. We find this youngest son from the weakest tribe crouching in the winepress trying to thresh wheat in secret, so the mighty Midianite army won’t get a whiff of his harvest and swoop down to steal it. All of Israel was feeling abandoned by God and their hearts were confused and resentful. Every time they tried to get back up, they were gleefully knocked down by some neighboring pagan army. God’s chosen people wondered if He had given up on them and chosen someone else to love, protect, and set apart for Himself.\n\nBut Israel wasn’t down because God had forgotten them. They were hiding in caves because they had stubbornly and persistently chased after evil for many years. They had established traditions and patterns that avoided God altogether. The paths their feet traced in their homes and in their towns led them in the ways of wickedness. They were in a rut, and it’s hard to look up and figure your way out of habitual sin.\n\nIt takes something dramatic to turn our hearts back toward God.\n\nGideon was trudging his sweaty rut like the rest of Israel, when an angel of the Lord appeared to him. Why would an angel appear to him? It wasn’t because Gideon was the one honorable man among thousands; it was because God’s time was right to raise up a leader in Israel. It is God who marks the seasons, who raises up leaders, and who brings down empires. “Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor over it in vain” (Psalm 127:1). All other planning and plotting is futile. \n\nI’ve never had to hide from an army, but I have had some low moments. I’m sure many of us can remember feeling confused and resentful at some point. In spite of our doubts and ruts, and the habitual trails that lead us to wickedness, God can lift us up to victory with Him. Gideon didn’t just decide to grit his teeth and pitch his military plan to the leaders. God chose him, called him, and promised him victory “as if Mideon were one man” (Judges 6:16).\n\nWhatever your circumstances may be today, don’t let them scare you. Don’t let the worn pathways of sin lure you into hopelessness. Don’t be deceived by the voices that tell you that your sin is too great, that your habits can never be broken. Our God can rescue and redeem even the most lost. He is light in the blackest night. Run to the One who controls the sea and the stars, and trust Him with your darkest secrets. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 4:1-24, Judges 5:1-31, Job 19:25-27, Psalm 68:7-10\n\nMy husband and I have the privilege of shepherding three little ladies through life, and our evenings often end with the same bedtime ritual. We read a story, pray together, and sing. For my middle daughter, it is quite important that we sing the same three songs every evening: “Before the Throne of God Above,” “Magnificat,” and “The Lord’s Prayer”—usually in that order. If I’m honest, this sometimes frustrates me. Why can’t we have some variety in our song choice? But, as I continued to think through today’s readings, I have come to see our same three songs in a new light. \n\nThe book of Judges recounts the tragedy of forgetfulness. It is a story of the Israelites’ downward spiral, culminating in Judges 21:25: “In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did whatever seemed right to him.” However, there is a momentary break in this downward spiral with the arrival of Deborah. \n\nWe first meet Deborah in Judges 4. She is sitting under a tree conducting business as usual, judging and prophesying. The Israelites, having suffered oppression at the hands of the Canaanites for twenty years, cry out to the Lord for deliverance. He inclines His ear, and speaking through Deborah, reveals a rescue plan by way of a woman named Jael, who ultimately kills King Jabin’s military leader, Sisera. This victory sets in motion the unraveling of Canaan’s defense and, ultimately, makes way for the Israelites to enjoy forty years of peace—double the amount of time they originally spent under King Jabin’s oppression. \n\nWhat is Deborah and Barak’s response? They break out into a victory song! They sing, detailing how God provided deliverance from their enemies. But their praise did more than serve as a celebration in that moment. It became a vehicle for future generations to remember God’s faithfulness. Compared to the rest of the book in its entirety, the song of Judges 5 interrupts the narrative flow, and is an intentional break in the story for the purpose of remembering. Like David in Psalm 68, Deborah and Barak are recalling and recounting the faithfulness of God. May we do the same. \n\nMay we remember what God has done: “God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the desert… You, God, showered abundant rain; you revived your inheritance when it languished” (Psalm 68:7,9). \n\nMay we remember what God is doing: “Israel’s leaders took charge, and the people gladly followed. Praise the LORD!” (Judges 5:2).\n\nMay we remember what God has promised to do: “But I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the end he will stand on the dust… I will see him myself; my eyes will look at him, and not as a stranger” (Job 19:25,27).\n\nWhich brings me back to those same three songs my family sings together at bedtime. We, like the Israelites, are tempted to forget, to lose sight of who we are and why we are here. It is our remembrance of what God has done for us that fights forgetfulness and propels us forward in our mission as followers of Jesus. May today, tomorrow, and all the days we’ve been given, be spent singing the praises of our holy, just, and infinitely loving God. \n\nEmily Chapman Richards is the daughter of Grammy® award-winning recording artist, Steven Curtis Chapman, and his wife, Mary Beth Chapman.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture reading: Judges 3:1-31, Psalm 91:1-16\n\nJust over a hundred years ago, a funny belief began to crop up among Western Christians. In Europe especially, Christians had enjoyed a long season of prosperity and peace, which began to shape their theology. They concluded that humans were evolving, outgrowing the bad habits of violence, war, and sin. Humans, they reasoned, were essentially good, and getting better with every generation.\n\nWhat these Christians developed was a weak view of sin and an idealistic view of human nature, and it remained popular for a while. It shaped Christians’ faith and the way they read Scripture, but it didn’t last very long. In 1914, the world was plunged into World War I, which shattered all of those illusions. As it turned out, humans were not evolving out of sin. In fact, we were no different than any generation before us. If anything, humans were only “advancing” in our technology for fighting each other. \n\nThis bit of Church history is good to keep in mind while reading the book of Judges, because it demonstrates a principle we will see again and again. Old Testament scholar Walter Brueggemann once wrote, “Prosperity breeds amnesia,” and there is perhaps no better description of what happened to Christians a century ago, and what happened to the Israelites in Judges. Every time the Israelites prospered, they didn’t simply forget God; they forgot what it means to be human in the world. They forgot their own sin. They forgot the world’s brokenness. And they forgot how desperately they needed God. So they lived as if they didn’t.  \n\nWe should never be too quick to explain the stories of violence and suffering in Judges. Neat and tidy answers almost always do a disservice to these difficult passages. That said, it is safe to say that the cycle of foreign invasions had an eye-opening effect on the Israelites, in the same way that World War I shattered the rose-colored glasses of idealistic Christians. When God tested “all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars” (Judges 3:1), you can’t help but wonder if this was another way of saying, “In the absence of war, the Israelites had forgotten. They had forgotten their weakness. They had forgotten their vulnerability. They had forgotten that they needed God.” \n\nIt was true then and it is still true today: prosperity breeds amnesia. In times of comfort, we do not simply forget God, but we also forget the seriousness of sin, the brokenness of this world, and why we so desperately need a Savior to mend it. That said, this kind of forgetting is one that most people in the world are never afforded. In regions of famine and civil war, it’s impossible to ignore that this world is not as it should be. But for those of us living in relative comfort, who rarely bump up against the jagged edges of this fractured planet, we can forget just how devastating the effects of sin have been.\n\nThat is one lesson we can take from Judges. It challenges us not only to remember God, but to remember our brokenness and the brokenness of the world. When we downplay sin, we downplay grace, and we downplay our dependency on it. So as ugly and horrible as suffering can be, and as much as it grieves God most of all, through it we can detect the still, small voice of the Spirit whispering to us: “This is why you need a Savior. This is why I came.”\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 2:1-23, Deuteronomy 4:9, 2 Timothy 2:2\n\nIn Judges 2, we read about two generations of Israelites: the Joshua generation and the post-Joshua generation. Joshua’s generation was faithful. Scripture says, “The people worshiped the LORD throughout Joshua’s lifetime and during the lifetimes of the elders who outlived Joshua. They had seen all the LORD’s great works He had done for Israel” (Judges 2:7).\n\nHowever, the post-Joshua generation was not faithful. After Joshua’s death and after the death of the elders who outlived him, this generation rose up as one who “did not know the LORD or the works He had done for Israel.” Therefore, they “did what was evil in the LORD’s sight” (Judges 2:10-11).\n\nOne generation had witnessed the great works the Lord had done for His people on their journey to claiming the promised land—the other had not. Because of this, this new generation turned from God to worship idols instead.\n\nIn graduate school, I had a good friend who was an atheist. We often talked about faith and Christianity. He thought it was odd that Christians felt the need to gather together once a week. “If the whole Jesus story is really true,” he said, “why do you all need to gather once a week to remind each other of it?”\n\nIt was a good question. At the time, I didn’t have a good answer, but I think Judges 2 speaks to this question. When we don’t remember the works of the Lord, we turn from him, and because we are made for worship, we look for other gods to worship. Like the children of Israel began to worship the gods of the Canaanites, we may begin to worship the gods our friends are worshiping, or the gods the media tells us to worship. We can easily lose sight of the one true God.\n\nThis is why Christians gather each Sunday and tell the same story again and again. This is why we drink from the cup and eat the bread. Jesus said, “Do this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19). He wanted us to remember, because He knew what would happen if we forgot.\n\nI don’t know what happened between Joshua’s generation and the next. Did they stop telling the story of what the Lord had done? Did this generation not hear about the parting of the Red Sea? The manna? The cloud that led the people by day and the pillar of fire that led them by night? Did they not heed this charge in Deuteronomy?\n\nBe on your guard and diligently watch yourselves, so that you don’t forget the things your eyes have seen and so that they don’t slip from your mind as long as you live.\n\nTeach them to your children and your grandchildren.\n\n-Deuteronomy 4:9\n\nWe don’t really know the answer. What we do know is one generation was faithful to God because they had seen what the Lord had done. The next generation was not, because they did not know what the Lord had done.\n\nHow grateful I am for those who’ve gone before me, telling their children of the great works the Lord has done. How thankful I am for those children, who then went on to tell their children about God, until the story trickled down through generations into a Church that is still gathering, still remembering, still passing the cup.\n\nLord, help us to remember your works and to never stop telling others about Your goodness. In continuing to worship You, the one true God, may we bring you glory, so the next generation might do the same.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Failure of the Tribes",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jessica Lamb\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 1:1-36, Genesis 49:8-12, Psalm 34:17\n\nI still remember the misguided giddiness I felt when my eighth grade English teacher announced we would be reading Romeo and Juliet. I knew little of Shakespeare at the time, beyond the belief that he was someone I should read and appreciate. All I really knew of the star-crossed pair was that they, and their love story, were famous. \n\nSo when I came to the end of the play, I was livid. Romeo and Juliet were both dead, and there was no happily ever after. What sort of love story was this? \n\nIt isn’t one, really. It’s a tragedy. Every twist and turn that leads to the demise of the young couple is meant to bring an ache to our hearts, because we realize how easily it could have been avoided. We’re meant to feel upset and distressed at the ending. That’s how tragedy works.\n\nThe book of Judges is the tragic, true story of the people of Israel ignoring God’s instructions, and then abandoning their faith to live like their pagan neighbors. After God’s people endured 400 years of slavery in Egypt, followed by forty years of wandering in the wilderness, Joshua led Israel into the promised land. Toward the end of his life, Joshua warned the Israelites to worship the Lord and serve Him only, and instructed them to drive the Canaanite people out of the land, so they would not be tempted to follow a false religion (Joshua 24:14-15). \n\nBut these opening verses in the book of Judges warn us that the Israelites didn’t obey. They repeated the sins of the Egyptians and enslaved the Canaanite people. They failed to drive the Canaanites out completely, and failed to fully establish a land of their own. And like the opening lines of Romeo and Juliet, we are warned that what we are about to read is a tragedy. \n\nIn Judges, the people of Israel forsake the Lord and adopt the worship practices of the Canaanites. They experience chaos and catastrophe in a time of unprecedented violence and oppression, led by mostly corrupt and cowardly judges. The Israelites become almost unrecognizable as the people of God. And then the book of Judges abruptly ends, with everyone doing whatever seems right to them (17:6). As readers, we’re left with a sense of longing for how things ought to be.\n\nBut God continues to work. The book of Ruth tells us that during this time, famine in Israel sent Naomi’s family to Moab, where her son married a woman named Ruth before he died. Ruth, a Moabite, pledged to stay with Naomi, an Israelite, and embrace the God of Israel. She went on to give birth to Obed, King David’s grandfather. From this lineage came Jesus, the Savior of the world. Our hope, the hope of all creation, is rooted in a foreign widow’s decision to follow God during the bleak time of the judges.\n\nI pray that as we read Judges, we will discover the source of true redemption, and turn back to the One who redeems. For when “the righteous cry out… the LORD hears, and rescues them from all their troubles” (Psalm 34:17).\n\nWe can draw hope from the fact that God continues to work through morally compromised, deeply flawed people and circumstances. He isn’t limited by our shortcomings. He isn’t stopped by the brokenness in our world. His story—and because of Him, our story—is not one of tragedy, but one of profound beauty and hope in Jesus Christ. Thanks be to God.\n\n\n\n",

Fox with feathered hair and a sweater vest. No? If you didn’t grow up under the tutelage of ‘80s sitcoms, all you need to know is this: Alex P. Keaton and family always had a little drama brewing. But, thirty minutes and some live studio-audience laughter later, things seemed to work themselves out. \n\nAlas, you and I aren’t living in an ‘80s sitcom. Real life is happening and we’re in the thick of it. Relationship issues don’t always resolve with a sincere side hug, and problems aren’t limited to finding a date for the school dance. \n\nLife is hard. It is beautiful, yes; but gosh, is it hard. Dear friends suffering from deep depression, family members whose loss stings as sharply as when their loved one first left, children who are hungry and enslaved around the world, and wars that rage on for reasons long forgotten. Not to mention the stack of dishes in the sink, the pile of unpaid bills on the counter, and the decision you just can’t bear to make. \n\nLife is hard.\n\nThe book of Ruth is a book about real life. It is the story of a family and of one woman in particular. She was loyal and loving, hardworking and humble—an ordinary woman who led an ordinary life. Ruth’s ordinary story is much like yours and mine; it bears the fingerprints of an extraordinary God. \n\nJust five verses in, the scene is set for the story, and straightaway you can tell it’s not a happily-ever-after kind of tale. Naomi has lost her husband, a loss with serious implications for a woman in her culture. Then, just ten years later, she loses both of her sons, too. Now, she is a childless widow, with no means for caring for herself or her two surviving daughters-in-law. \n\nThis is a real-life story of real-life suffering. And let’s be honest—doesn’t that bring you a little relief? It is not a story of kings or princes, great leaders or stunning turns of events. This is just the story of a family facing loss, grief, and uncertainty, and the God who cares intimately about it all, every single detail. \n\nLet’s venture into this story set in the very town where Christ would be born. Let’s enter into the life of this unconventional family, ordinary folk God would use to bring about the coming of His kingdom in Christ Jesus. And let’s see what God has to teach us about His faithfulness right here, in our hard and beautiful life. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Ruth 1:6-18, Hosea 2:18-23\n\nI did a terrible thing to my mother-in-law.  \n\nI took her son away. She and my father-in-law were very gracious, and they let him go. I understand that we raise children up to let them go. Indeed, I think few things are more joyful than to see children well-married. But now that I’m a mother of sons, I’ve got my dander up just thinking about some young floozy batting her eyes at my boys.\n\nI’m very fortunate to have a creative, intelligent, and godly mother-in-law. (She might read this, and she’s quite a woman, y’all!) Nevertheless, it’s not a relationship that comes easily. This delicate relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law doesn’t feel like home right away. \n\nRuth’s husband died; her beautiful boy was gone, and with him the tenuous thread that tied her to Naomi was poised to unravel too. Imagine Ruth, Orpah, and Naomi sitting around the metaphorical kitchen table, staring at their hands. Together, but alone, the bonds that held them together seemingly gone. Each wilting under her own personal loss. What happens next? How do we pick up the pieces from this?\n\nRuth chooses Naomi. That’s her next step. It’s so unexpected. She could have stayed in her hometown, with her own people. But no, she said, “Let your people be my people!” (Ruth 1:16). Imagine giving up your home and relocating across the country to live with your mother-in-law. It’s a bold move.\n\nRuth binds herself to her mother-in-law, vowing to do six things with Naomi: travel, dwell, claim her people, worship her God, die where she dies, and be buried where she is buried. Ruth is not messing around. She could have just said, “Okay, let’s go. I’ll check it out and see if it’s for me.” Nope, Ruth was ALL IN.  \n\nThis decision to stay with Naomi is so all-encompassing because it is a decision to follow the God of Israel. God uses this mother-in-law relationship unexpectedly, just as he plants Ruth quite unexpectedly in the genealogy of Christ. He used Naomi to woo Ruth to the one true God. She is in love, not with Naomi’s beauty, riches, or good humor, but her wisdom, virtue, and grace. Naomi preserves these in spite of the huge loss of her husband and sons.\n\nGod was doing a mighty work in Naomi.\n\nRuth didn’t want her brush with the God of Israel to end.\n\nSo Ruth clung to Naomi—the one person who linked her to the God of Israel.\n\nWhat kind of God is this who could draw us, against all odds, into what seems like the least comforting of circumstances? He is the God who offers comfort in sorrow, bread in a time of famine, blessing in a season of barrenness, and joy that overcomes all sorrow. He is the God of good news. This is what Ruth saw in Naomi and in Naomi’s God. This is why she joyfully concludes, “Let your God be my God!”\n\n",

Have you ever uttered “pray for me” and meant “pray instead of me, because I just can’t do it”? \n\nIf prayer is a picture of believers lifting one another before the Lord, there are times I have been full-on carried. I don’t mean they’ve just walked alongside me or encouraged me to go on. No, they have picked me up from the pit and held me high before the Lord, my spiritual self limp and lifeless, desperately in need of the life-breath of my Savior. It sounds melodramatic until you’re in the thick of it, too spent to sigh another “please” or “amen.”\n\nThis kind of spiritual and physical exhaustion is what I see when I picture Naomi walking into town that day, so affected by her suffering that she is hardly recognizable. The townswomen whispered to one another, shocked at the condition of the friend they used to know. Naomi quickly set them straight. “It’s over for me,” she said. “Don’t call me Pleasant. Call me Bitter” (Ruth 1:20, my paraphrase).\n\nNaomi’s circumstances were indeed awful. She’d buried her husband, lost two sons, and said goodbye to a daughter-in-law. She had no hope of a grandchild, no path of provision. “I went away full,” she told them, “and the Lord has brought me back empty” (Ruth 1:21). Yet, there was no fist-shaking at heaven. No renouncing her faith. Naomi believed God was sovereign, even in her tragedy. \n\nBut even this believing woman had trouble seeing past her circumstances. The hand was dealt, the credits were rolling. Naomi believed with her head that her God was sovereign, but she was too soul-weary to believe with her heart. And so she called it. Game over. Name changed. \n\nNaomi could not imagine being filled back up. She couldn’t picture her daughter-in-law remarried to an upstanding man who would welcome them both into his family. She couldn’t dream of holding a grandson in her arms. She couldn’t imagine how bitterness could become beauty, but her sovereign God could.\n\nNaomi named herself Bitter, but God names her—and us!—Blessed.\n\nHe names us Forgiven (1 John 1:9).\n\nHe names us Beloved (Romans 5:8).\n\nHe names us Redeemed (Ephesians 1:7).\n\nThese names hold true even when circumstances don’t, because ours is a God who is mighty over affliction and blessing, bitterness and beauty, past and future. \n\nThe same woman who walked into her hometown deflated of joy and hope, nevertheless trusted herself and her daughter-in-law to the Lord’s keeping. “Go ahead, my daughter,” Naomi said to Ruth, sending her out into the fields to gather up God’s provision. And provide, He would. Their circumstances were anything but good, but their God was always good. \n\nCircumstances change, but they do not change our God. And they do not change the saving power of Jesus Christ. We need not waste time shaking our fists at heaven when we can run full-force into His arms, trusting He can redeem even us, even this, even now.\n\nWe are not named by our circumstances. We are named by our good God. \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Ruth 2:4-17, Deuteronomy 28:8-9, Psalm 36:7-9\n\nI’m grinning as I sit in the coffee shop typing this. Thankfully, there’s no one at the table facing mine. \n\nI can’t help it. This story is why I can’t get enough of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Because do you know who is declared royalty in the eyes of God? A poor, Moabite widow gleaning barley. I can’t even stand it, I love this story so much.\n\nLet me back up and explain. Here we have our dear Ruth, busting her tail in the barley fields in an honest effort to keep herself and her mother-in-law alive. She “happened” into the field of Boaz. And he “happened” to take notice of her. And (spoiler alert) all these little happenings will end up with Ruth and Boaz at the marriage altar one day, a beautiful ending to an abrupt and terrible life twist. \n\nThe thing is, none of this was happenstance. The hand of a gracious God led Naomi back to Bethlehem and led Ruth to go with her. The hand of a gracious God led Ruth to Boaz’s fields that first day and turned Boaz’s heart toward the hard-working widow from a foreign land. What appeared as coincidence was God’s hand continually at work. \n\nIn the same upside-down way of the gospel, Ruth’s simple and consistent acts of faithfulness have Kingdom-size ramifications. \n\nRuth was not some long-time, super-religious believer who earned herself a spot in God’s capital-S Story (and even in the lineage of Christ!). She was just a young woman doing hard things because she believed it was what she was called to do. We don’t hear this in her words, but we see it in her actions. Her faithfulness is not bright and shiny; her work is not award-winning or perfectly planned. She was simply following God’s lead, taking the next right step.\n\nLike Ruth, we cannot see the whole of our story, let alone His Story. We aren’t meant to. But we can follow God’s lead, knowing that our yeses to Him make a Kingdom-size difference, even when no one sees.\n\nAre you sitting in a quiet apartment this morning, wondering if your next steps matter? Are you driving to an office where you’ll work tirelessly without thanks or appreciation, just like yesterday? Are you settling in for another day at home, serving little hearts in a million unnoticed ways? \n\nHear these words from Boaz to Ruth as my prayer over you today:\n\n“May the Lord reward you for what you have done, and may you receive a full reward from the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge.”\n\n– Ruth 2:12\n\nAnd as you do the work set before you, know this: Your small and steady acts of faithfulness are being used in big and beautiful ways in the kingdom of God.  \n\n",

In fact, riding the bus seems to be the bookend horror of my education—terrifying when I was 6 and mortifying when I was 16. (Thanks again, Mom and Dad.) \n\nWhen I was in kindergarten, the buses weren’t identified by numbers, but by animals. I rode the squirrel bus—not to be confused with the chipmunk bus my best friend rode to her house on the other side of town—and was required to wear a luggage tag flaunting an illustrated picture of the animal on my backpack. \n\nEvery day at 3 pm, the school bell would ring and we’d file outside to our animal-specific location, and every day I remember the same tears, wailing, and resistance. One fellow kindergartener, a curly-haired boy with a blue backpack, was not happy with his assigned position in the bus-zone zoo. “I WANT TO RIDE THE MANATEE BUSSSS!,” he’d wail until his face matched the color of his backpack. \n\nNow, I don’t know if the appeal of this particular bus was the swimming sea cow itself (understandable), a cute passenger with pigtails, or a problem with the squirrel bus he’d been assigned to (also understandable). But one thing was clear: the boy was decidedly discontent. \n\nI may have kept my cool about the squirrel bus, but I, too, become decidedly discontent more often than I’d care to admit. This is especially true when it comes to the love story of Ruth and Boaz. I mean, promise me a Boaz and my single-girl self will run, not walk, to the closest field and gather grain just like Ruth did. That probably wouldn’t work for me, but does that mean God is a better provider to Ruth than He is to me?\n\nWe must decide a few things here: God is either the ultimate Provider, or not at all. He is either in the business of redemption, or He is off the clock altogether. His hand is either strong, or it is weak. He either chose us, or He rejected us. There is no sliding scale according to our worthiness. In fact, His love for us and devotion to us rests on His faithfulness, not ours (Deuteronomy 7:7-9).\n\nNo matter where our feet rest, we are always standing in the field of God’s provision. \n\nI’m reminded of the ways the teachers on bus duty tried to reason with Manatee Boy.  \n\nThey’d say, “That bus isn’t going to take you home, but here’s the one that is!” \n\nThe same is true for us. God’s provision is a vehicle to His perfect will. Maybe unexpected kindness comes to you in the form of a Boaz, or maybe it looks a little different—a new job, a needed friend, a resolved conflict. Either way, our strong Provider is always present, giving His children what they need.\n\nEither way, we’re all headed home.\n\n\n\n",

Right?  \n\nNaomi set Ruth up on an incredibly intimate and awkward first date. First of all, she tells Ruth to go to the threshing floor. In the ancient world, the threshing floor was sometimes like the middle school bleachers. In fact, the threshing floor was often a place where folks went to make whoopie (Hosea 9:1).\n\nBut whoopie was far from Naomi’s scheme for Ruth that night. There is no indecency in her set up. Rather, it’s a chaste plan to find Ruth’s kinsman-redeemer (Ruth 2:20). Naomi wants to find a husband for Ruth; she wants Ruth to be at rest. And with the right partner, marriage is rest!\n\nBoaz was a good guy. He was a farmer with weathered face and hands, and on this day he was winnowing. Winnowing means “party time” because it’s the final step in separating the barley from the chaff. The harvest was finally ready, and he and his workers were having a well-earned celebration.\n\nBoaz was a good boss. He worked with the harvesters, then ate and drank and celebrated with them. The boss doesn’t have to get his hands dirty, but great bosses aren’t too proud to serve when they are needed. Then he went to bed at a good hour, so that he was already asleep by midnight. He was all set to be ready for work again the next morning. Oh, Boaz—so responsible!\n\nBoaz was a plain man. He lay out in the barley that night, not because he didn’t have a bed, but to guard his harvest and to be close to work tomorrow. He was a man’s man. \n\nOkay, so are we totally in love with Boaz now?\n\nNaomi sends Ruth to him. And when you put a man and a woman together alone in the dark, it’s a risk, right? But Naomi knew Boaz was sober-minded and Ruth was chaste. Naomi trusted that Boaz would tell Ruth what to do. \n\nOur dear Ruth creeps onto his farm, uncovers his feet and lies down on the hard ground, waiting for Boaz to wake up and acknowledge her. This date is completely terrifying! She could’ve easily doubted the whole thing, wondering, “What if Naomi was wrong? What if Boaz looks at me and recoils in horror? What if he rejects me?”\n\nI imagine her lying there at his feet, watching the stars in their courses, listening to the wind in the barley, and awaiting either her doom or her redemption.\n\nShe calls to him, “I am Ruth, your maiden; take me under your protecting wing” (Ruth 3:9 MSG). And that night Boaz sends her away no less chaste but much happier than when she came. He gives her the promise of marriage and protection.\n\nWe, too, are sometimes on the cold, hard ground of life, putting our reputation at risk, waiting for our redemption. When we lay ourselves at the feet of our Redeemer, He does not recoil in horror. He does not reject us. He looks at us, small and shivering, and gathers us close to Him. He loves us.\n\nCall out to your Redeemer, who waits to take you under His wing. Lay at His feet and bask in your redemption.\n\n\n\n",

I have. I often start strong, feeling bold and excited, my heart ready and willing to obey. I can’t help but think, This is it! This is the moment life changes because I said yes! \n\nThen, inevitably, a bend or a bump in the smooth, straight road I envisioned leaves me doubting. But wait. I said yes. I was obedient. So why is this still so hard?\n\nRuth has said all the right yeses in her story. She has been faithful to her mother-in-law Naomi in many ways, but especially so where Boaz is concerned. Ruth has truly put herself out there in trust, and it seems everything has been leading up to this moment. \n\nWhat a surprise it must have been to be told simply to wait—and not for a certain amount of time, but indefinitely. (Indefinite waiting is the worst kind of waiting, if you ask me.) Ruth was instructed to wait until Boaz found the nearer kin, or redeemer, and ask if that man would marry Ruth, per the custom of their culture (Ruth 3:12-13). And who knew how long that would take or what would happen?\n\nWe aren’t told if this frustrated Ruth, but it frustrates me for her. This is the point where I’d likely throw in the towel, caught up in a thought spiral that goes something like this: Well, it’s all over now. I’ll be married to some man I’ve never met, these past few months will have been a total waste, and all I’ll have to show for it is a sore back and some barley. Perfect.\n\nBut Naomi—the same woman who once named herself “Bitter”—offered enough faith for the both of them. She encouraged Ruth, saying, “Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out” (Ruth 3:18).\n\nWait, and then wait again. Isn’t this the way of life? Nowhere are we promised an easy time just because we obey or come to what we believe is a capital-A Answer. But our Father waits too—both with us and for us. His Word says that He longs to be gracious toward us and show us compassion and mercy (Isaiah 30:18). “His steadfast love endures forever,” through all things, all the time, just like the psalm says (Psalm 118).\n\nThis doesn’t mean that things will turn out exactly the way we think they should. But it does mean that God’s hand is always at work in our story, even when we can’t see it. Even when we’re waiting. God’s plan would have still gone ahead of Ruth, even if Boaz came back to say he couldn’t marry her. She would still have been God’s daughter, and His covenant promise to her would still have been true. \n\nIn your waiting place, cling to the hope that God will not leave our stories unfinished or unredeemed. They may not look how we expected but, as with Ruth and Naomi, our story is His story. We can wait with hope, and we can trust and obey with confidence. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

(I say “our Ruth” because we all feel a little bit protective over her at this point, don’t we? Maybe we even see a little of ourselves in her.) And Boaz is pursuing a future with Ruth through the proper channels. He respects the law, and he’s demonstrating over and over again that he is an honorable guy. \n\nBoaz wants this to be legal—for the agreement to be made in plain sight, in the presence of elders. This is a particularly public scene, and it’s a cornerstone in the foundation of the most public scenes in Christian history.\n\nThis narrative almost makes me want to giggle with excitement and nod knowingly. When Boaz fairly and legally earns the right to take Ruth as his wife, the ten elders invoke this awesome, ancient blessing for fruitfulness on their union: “May the Lord make [Ruth] like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you be powerful in Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem” (Ruth 4:11).\n\nYou guys, it’s almost like they knew!\n\nGod reveals a peek at His awesome tapestry when we look at the bigger picture of Boaz and Ruth’s love story. We pull back the curtain and see that Ruth’s decision to follow Naomi was so much more than an address change; it is a tiny piece of God’s grand plan. \n\nThat blessing of fruitfulness would soon bring forth a son, Obed, who would be the father of Jesse. And Jesse’s son was David. (Yep, the guy who slayed Goliath, was anointed king, and wrote many of the Psalms.) David also happens to be the direct ancestor of a baby whose parents returned to their hometown, Bethlehem, to deliver Him in a manger.\n\nJesus. Renowned in Bethlehem, indeed!\n\nRuth and Boaz have an awesome family history of redemption. Even better, through this family tree, the Redeemer—our Redeemer—would come to buy back the world.\n\nChrist has redeemed us like Boaz redeemed Ruth. Their love story is our love story. In the most public way possible, Jesus redeemed us once and for all, a people for His own possession.  \n\nMay we go forward today knowing we are loved so genuinely and so incredibly by the One who redeemed us to be His.\n\nWe are loved, indeed. And we are His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Ruth 4:13-17, Psalm 127, Proverbs 24:27\n\nIsn’t it amazing? In just four chapters, we have seen two women move from overwhelming despair to incredible hope. Remember how Naomi interacted with her friends in the first chapter? “‘Don’t call me Naomi. Call me Mara,’ she answered, ‘for the Almighty has made me very bitter. I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty’” (Ruth 1:20-21).\n\nNow, in chapter four, her friends are surrounding her, praising God for the birth of Ruth and Boaz’s son, Obed, another potential kinsman-redeemer in her family tree. What was empty in Naomi’s life is now full, and her friends declare, “Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you this day without a redeemer” (Ruth 4:14). \n\nIn the midst of trial, I am always tempted to think the opposite of what Naomi’s friends declared—that the Lord has left me, and there will be no redemption to my story. We’ve all been there. You might be there right now. \n\nDuring these times, when I don’t know what the future holds, I often try and plan it out myself. Grasping for a sense of control, I make lists, imagine scenarios, send emails, do whatever I need to do to feel like I’m making progress, to feel like I’m fixing my problems, to feel like I am getting somewhere. This is what I would have done had I found myself in a Ruth-and-Naomi situation: widowed, childless, desperate, and staring at a shaky, unclear future. \n\nThe problem with my go-to method of scrambling and planning is not the plan itself, but rather, the overseer of that plan. Me. \n\nPsalm 127 says that when we are building our own house, our labor is in vain. When we are watching over own city, our watching is in vain. The Lord is the only one who knows the plan and has the power to put it into action. Try as we may, we simply get in the way.\n\nNaomi could not have foreseen the beauty that would come from her story of ashes (Isaiah 61:1-3). What God was building was beyond her predictions and planning. Though she lost her sons and her husband, as her friends reminded her, having Ruth as her daughter-in-law turned out to better than having seven sons (Ruth 4:15). \n\nJust as redemption was in God’s plan for Naomi, so is it in God’s plan for us.\n\nDown the bloodline from Boaz and Ruth and Obed is our Redeemer, Jesus. In Christ, there is no such thing as a story beyond redemption. There is only resurrection, restoration, and rejoicing, even in the most unlikely of circumstances and with the most unlikely of subjects. \n\nIf you’re wondering today if the Lord has left you, and the idea redemption at this point feels impossible, hold fast to the promise we see in Ruth and Naomi’s journey. Nothing is too much, too big, or too scary for our Savior. God has not walked away from you. He’s done the opposite. He has drawn near to you through His Son, Jesus. \n\nToday, let’s take a step back today from whatever it is we are trying to control our way out of. Instead of planning and building, let’s sit in the promise of our Redeemer, believing that God is sovereign and His redemption is already ours.\n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Ruth 4:18-22, Matthew 1:2-16, Romans 15:12, Luke 3:32-38\n\nHave you ever seen the Bayeux Tapestry? I haven’t seen it in person. It lives in Normandy, France—ooh la la! The tapestry narrates William the Conqueror’s victory at the Battle of Hastings. It’s very famous, very big, and sometimes very beautiful. The top side of it makes sense and tells a story. The underside is a hot mess and looks like the weaver didn’t have a plan.\n\nGod’s will throughout history is like a tapestry. We are underneath looking up, and all the random threads tied in knots and snarls don’t make sense to us. We can’t see the tapestry of history like God sees it. From His perspective it tells the story of His love and plan for mankind from the beginning of time.\n\nOur earthly perspective is limited. So, when God weaves together the family line of Christ, He uses people we would never expect. We assume the line of ancestry for the Son of God would be filled with “respectable” male leaders. But God used women, foreigners, illegitimate children, and a prostitute. (Sidebar: we live in a great world where women can be leaders, but Ruth lived in a world where leaders only looked like serious-faced, respectable men.)\n\nRuth was not only a foreigner; she was from an enemy country, Moab. The Israelites despised the Moabites. So when Ruth walked into town, that’s likely what they saw—a woman with the invisible label of “Moabite” hovering over her head. She herself wasn’t guilty, but she was an easy target for prejudice. And God chose to weave her into His Kingly line. See how the tapestry looks crazy from underneath?\n\nGod makes Ruth an ancestor of David and the Messiah. It is the greatest of  honors. This is the story God was penning all along, from the beginning of the book. \n\nLook at some of the names in Christ’s genealogy:\n\nPerez\n\nHezron\n\nRam\n\nAmminadab\n\nNashon\n\nSalmon\n\nBoaz\n\nObed\n\nJesse\n\nDavid\n\nDo you know all the people on that list? I don’t. \n\nThe story of Ruth shows us that there are no insignificant people in God’s plan, even if we only know them as a name on a list. He takes the despised and the rejected, the lowly and the insignificant, even His enemies, and He binds them to Christ. \n\nWhat looks messy and meaningless to us is, from God’s perspective, an intentional and precise way He is working to establish His kingdom. He takes what appear to be loose, broken, and unrelated threads and reveals how He was weaving something eternally beautiful all along.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY She Reads Truth\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 1:1-22, Psalm 32:7, Daniel 6:8, Daniel 6:13-18\n\nThere’s an old saying that goes, “When God closes a door, He opens a window.” Perhaps you’ve heard it? But God’s work in the lives of His people is far more magnificent than that. \n\nEven better than closing doors and opening windows, what we find in the book of Esther is the active, invisible, and preemptive hand of God at work in the most unexpected places. \n\nToday’s reading sets the stage by casting an ominous shadow over a seemingly happy time of feasting and abundance. The king throws a party meant to last for 180 days, but when he summons his queen so that he might show off her beauty to his guests, she refuses to come to him. This decision has repercussions that will reverberate throughout the kingdom, kicking the rest of the story into motion. \n\nReaders respond in different ways to this conflict between the king and queen. How are we to view her defiance? How should we measure his reaction? But whether we interpret Vashti’s actions as brave or bad, the larger truth of this book remains unchanged. This story is about God and His providential care for His chosen people in exile. In the book of Esther and throughout all of Scripture, God is the main character of every story. \n\nThough His name is not directly mentioned, God’s presence is evident in this Old Testament book. And His sovereignty and goodness are not dependent upon our reactions and interpretations. When faced with an unexpected turn of events or unwelcome challenge, most of us turn to scheming and problem solving, trying to figure things out and then “fix” them as we see fit. But the book of Esther shows us that God does not go around simply reacting to whatever we throw at Him. He doesn’t work that way. No, He acts first. His rescue plans are already in place—even before danger comes our way.  \n\nGod’s involvement in our lives is so much better than closed doors and open windows. In the story of Esther, and in our story of salvation, God designs our deliverance even before man begins to devise our destruction.\n\nThe book of Esther is short, rich, and ultimately points to Christ overcoming death by giving His own life—a ransom for us all. As you read, look for the active, invisible, preemptive hand of God. Consider the ways God has designed your own deliverance, and imagine the invisible ways He is caring for you even now. \n\nGod is good. And He is at work.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 2, Proverbs 31:10-31\n\nWell, I have to admit; the circumstances of Esther’s appointment as queen are a bit… gritty. \n\nI wish I could say that everything in the book of Esther is beautiful because it’s in the Bible. But the truth is, the Old Testament is filled with the stories of ordinary people who make extraordinarily bad choices. Yes, “All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching” (2 Timothy 3:16), but clearly, we aren’t meant to emulate the idol-loving Jezebel, the jealousy of Joseph’s brothers, or the murderous Cain. \n\nIt’s not Esther I take issue with; it’s her circumstances. I can’t help but read her story and feel a little disturbed by the idea of a young woman kept in a harem. It’s creepy to imagine a king trying out different women until he picks his favorite. And it sure seems like Esther was beloved largely because of her looks (Esther 2:15). I suppose that makes her sound eerily similar to a contestant on some reality television show. It makes for an entertaining show, but it’s surely not showcasing the most life-giving way to date in real life.\n\nSo then, what can we learn from Esther’s appointment as queen?\n\nFirst of all, it is good to remember that God works through imperfect circumstances. I don’t know about you, but that’s a huge relief to me. Contrary to the gospel of social media, we don’t need to have perfect lives for God to move in our lives. Esther was a persecuted orphan girl living in a brothel, but the Lord used her to save His people in a big way. \n\nThe heart of the Father is to bring beauty from ashes (Isaiah 61:3). This is demonstrated in His redeeming work again and again, through the imperfect circumstances of Scripture’s heroes and heroines. Esther is a godly woman who’s called to act in a precarious situation. What you might notice is that Esther took the wise counsel of those she trusted, keeping her ethnicity a secret until the right time as Mordecai advised, and adorning herself as the king’s eunuch instructed. \n\nSure, Esther could have been prideful, determining she ultimately knew best. She could have blurted out her secret and chosen her own fashion statements. But had she gone that route, it might have changed the king’s reaction and the entire story. \n\nSo was Esther passive or humble? Weak or wise?\n\nWhile the circumstances surrounding Esther’s story may raise a few eyebrows in today’s culture, the woman herself seems to be an admirable and fierce role model. Esther knew that “charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting,” but the wisdom found in learning to fear the Lord does not fade (Proverbs 31:30). Out of wisdom and humility, she sought the help she needed. And through that counsel, God gave her the courage to walk into a life-threatening situation on behalf of His people.\n\nEsther trusted in her God and in His perfect will. Through her story, we are reminded that our pasts are never too crooked, our circumstances never too disappointing, to take part in the world-changing work of our heavenly Father.\n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 3:1-15, Psalm 68:20, Proverbs 16:33\n\nAt times, my life can feel like one of those “Choose Your Own Adventure” books I used to read back in the fourth grade. I find myself at a fork in the road, worrying that if I make the wrong choice the plot will be ruined, the protagonist (i.e. me) won’t be rescued, and my story won’t ever be worth reading. \n\nBut the Bible is a different kind of book. God’s Word is uniquely able to lift my eyes off of the decisions that paralyze me, and instead refocus them on the “author and perfecter” of my story, and of your story, too—of the bigger story that has already been written (Hebrews 12:2). \n\nHere in the book of Esther, the storyline of God’s people takes a desperate turn. Fueled by ego, power, and a desire for revenge, Haman is “filled with fury” (Esther 3:5) and plots the genocide of the Jews. He’d already decided to destroy the Jews, but he waited to show his hand until the “signs”—the casting of lots (v.7)—seemed to confirm that this was more than vindication, that it was a divine assignment. \n\nCasting lots looked much like rolling a pair of dice, and was often used as a way of seeking divine guidance. Joshua cast lots to divide up the promised land among the tribes of Israel (Joshua 18:6). The apostles cast lots to find Judas’s replacement (Acts 1:26). Here, King Ahasuerus’s officials cast lots in his court, and Haman tasks himself with interpreting them. \n\nOn the day Haman chose to move forward, an edict of death was signed and delivered throughout the land, seemingly sealing the doom of God’s people. But their story isn’t determined by a single decision or a lone madman. Our lives are not a Choose Your Own Adventure book where we sink or swim, survive or die, based solely on our ability to make the right choice. \n\nGod’s people would be spared, not because they did everything right and Haman did everything wrong. The edict of death would be repealed, not because Haman didn’t have the power to enforce it—he did—but because there is a stronger hand writing the story. \n\nThere is no rolling the dice with the sovereignty of God. “The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD” (Proverbs 16:33). His plans cannot be thwarted. His story cannot be edited. His people cannot be ripped from His loving hand. \n\nThe story God writes in Esther ultimately points to Jesus. Again, wicked rulers, high on power and poisoned by jealousy, sought to destroy God’s Chosen. Again, the government officials issued decrees that seemed to seal a deal with darkness. Only this time, the edict was not repealed. Christ was killed for our benefit. And once again, the lots were cast: \n\nAnd they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take (Mark 15:24). \n\nGod is sovereign, capable of having His way in our lives and in our history books. While Roman soldiers cast lots to divide up Jesus’ bloody robe, He was already at work making all things new. No man can stop Him. No plot can take Him out. In His sovereignty, He rescued the Jews from Haman’s hatred, just as He rescued us from our sin. Truly, “Our God is a God of salvation” (Psalm 68:20).\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

Any encounter on the subway, any phone call, and every relationship irresistibly impelled her to tell people the good news. Although she was a gifted linguist with a degree from Cambridge, she carried Bible tracts in her pockets and she wasn’t afraid to use them.\n\nNo amount of poor or sad or weird was enough to keep Rachel from befriending strangers and reaching out to them with hope and love. She was inspiring and a little overwhelming.\n\nOne afternoon, Rachel invited me to a street music event she was staging on Kärntner Straße. She is a classical violinist and had gathered other string musicians to play a concert and share the gospel on that ancient, black stone street.\n\nFeeling both a little shy and peckish, I got a gelato and went antique shopping instead.\n\nI missed an opportunity. God didn’t need me to help share His gospel; His gospel will go forth whether I stand up and speak His name or not. In fact, if I can’t muster a good word about the Lord, Scripture says even the stones will cry out in my place (Luke 19:40).\n\nGod invites us to join His work, not for His sake, but for ours. God invited Esther to join Him in saving the Jewish nation. If Esther had refused to go to the king, God still would have saved His people, but she would have missed an opportunity. As Esther’s cousin Mordecai said: \n\n“If you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jewish people from another place, but you and your father’s family will be destroyed. Who knows, perhaps you have come to your royal position for such a time as this.”\n\n– Esther 4:14\n\nOur refusal to take part in God’s work doesn’t thwart God. It limits our privilege to take part in what He is doing. God can even use unrepentant sinners to achieve His good purposes. Consider Pharaoh, Caiaphas the high priest, and Pontius Pilate (Exodus 9:12; John 18:14; John 19:5-16). “But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).\n\nGod’s providence is comprehensive, wise, and holy. His timing and calling are no mistake, and just as He did with Esther, He has placed us here and now, for such a time as this. \n\nWe, like Esther, can have courage, comfort, and peace. From a human perspective, our lives and circumstances can seem totally out of control and scary. But we can rest in God’s providence, knowing that He is working. \n\nLook for God’s invitation to join Him in His work. Have courage, comfort, and peace—you can join Him now! You can always go get a gelato later.\n\n \n\n",

Sitting at the head of the table were hosts Michael Eisner, former CEO of Disney, and his wife, Jane. In charge of passing the bread baskets was their friend George Lucas, creator of Star Wars, as well as Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, the guests of honor.\n\nIt was sometime in the ‘80s and there was reason to celebrate. Dick and Jeana had just become the first people to fly around the world without stopping.\n\nAfter the dessert had disappeared from their plates and they’d heard story after story about Dick and Jeana’s worldwide adventure, Jane Eisner raised the question many of us would have asked. “Well, now that you’ve accomplished the pinnacle of your aspirations, what could you possibly do next?”\n\nWithout hesitation, Dick responded, “I’m going to Disneyland!” Without hesitation, Jane responded, “That’s a good slogan.” And so it was.\n\nFrom the 1987 Super Bowl on, the answer to, “You won! What are you going to do now?” became “Disneyland.” And yet, when we watch sports reporters ask this question, it always seems a little silly, doesn’t it? Because after the Gatorade coolers have been thrown, and the trophies have all been shined, the athletes already have exactly what they were after in the first place: victory. What else could a Super Bowl champion possibly need?\n\nIn the books of Esther and Mark, we find two very different women who happen to have their king’s ear—Esther and Herodias’s daughter. Both women are asked a remarkably similar question: “What is it you want? Whatever you want, even if it’s half the kingdom, will be done” (Esther 5:3; Mark 6:23, my paraphrase).\n\nThe similarities between their stories stop there. Overwhelmed with possibility, Herodias’s daughter consults her mother, asking what desires she ought to demand, and they soon decide on their perfect request: John the Baptist’s head. On a platter. Perhaps she believed that for them, the most beneficial and powerful thing that could happen would be the destruction of God’s people. Her choice reeks of pride.\n\nPride comes before destruction, and an arrogant spirit before a fall.\n\n– Proverbs 16:18\n\nEsther, on the other hand, asks the king and Haman to attend a banquet where she herself will be the one preparing the platters. This probably seemed like a strange request, even to Esther. But instead of dreaming about the riches that could be hers, she keeps her heart close to the Lord’s. Esther believes the most beneficial and powerful thing that could happen to her is the rescue of her people—of God’s people. Her request is steeped in humility.\n\nEsther lives from a rooted belief in the kingdom that’s already been won for her. She makes choices based on riches she’s already received. Because she trusts in the King on High, she takes joy in making herself low. What else could a beloved daughter of the King possibly need?\n\nMaybe we need to be asking each other new questions as we gather around our own dinner tables. After all, we’ve already been given the kingdom. Now, how will we act? What will we do next?\n\nMay those questions lead us to respond with humility. May they lead us back, again and again, to the heart of the Father.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 6:1-14, Proverbs 26:27, Isaiah 52:1-2\n\nAren’t we all born with a strong sense of justice? From a young age, we tattle on the wrongdoers and we vehemently defend what we call “ours.” We fight for what we believe to be fair. As we grow up, we hopefully mature in our understanding of right and wrong, just and unjust, godly and ungodly. \n\nThis sense of justice is the reason Mordecai’s honoring and Haman’s humbling is so satisfying as we read on in the book of Esther. We want the good guys to win and the bad guys to lose. We tend to like it when people get what is coming to them. As Proverbs 26:27 puts it, “The one who digs a pit, will fall into it.”\n\nIs it a coincidence then, that King Ahasuerus cannot sleep, and so he asks for the daily events to be read to him? No, this event demonstrates God’s sovereignty. In fact, the book of Esther is filled with “coincidences” and fortunate turns of events, making it evident that God is in control and actively working on behalf of His people. During a time of exile and suffering, God rescued His children through an unlikely orphan girl, enacting justice on their behalf. \n\nUnfortunately, the world is still a place of injustice today. We see the bad guys winning. We see evil, hate, death, and disease infecting the world. Life is far from fair for most—something we’ve probably all been told at some point. \n\nWe still cry out when someone wrongs us. We grieve when a devastating attack occurs somewhere in the world. We cannot accept the imperfection and pain of this life. C.S. Lewis said, “If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world.”\n\nWhen our hearts cry out for justice, for good to prevail over evil, our hearts are really crying out for heaven. We long for Christ to come back and make things right once and for all. We long for the new heaven and the new earth (Isaiah 65:17). \n\nIn the stories of Esther, Joseph, Moses, and others, God intervened to save His people because He loved them and He cared about their plight. The greatest demonstration of God’s love was certainly when the Father sent His own perfect Son to die in our place so that justice could be satisfied. We were ransomed because of how much God loves us and loves justice.\n\nWhile we wait for the second coming of the Lord, all is not lost. We have been called to join in the work of kingdom building with Christ even now (1 Corinthians 3:9). Although our final home is not here, we’ve been instructed to pray for God’s will to be done “on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10).\n\nEsther’s story was one of encouragement to the Jewish people in the midst of exile. It was a story to remind them that God is over all and God is good. In a less than perfect world, let Esther be a story of encouragement to all who believe.\n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 7:1-10, Psalm 91:2-3, Revelation 20:11-15\n\nLately, I have been in a season of waiting. There is a lot of transition and change happening in the coming months, but at the moment, I feel stuck—like I’ve been running full speed, but I’ve had to come to a sudden stop. There’s a huge ravine in front of me, and I’ve reached as far as the current path will take me. I have to wait for a bridge to be built before I can cross to the other side. \n\nBut I don’t want to wait for the bridge. Waiting for the bridge to be built takes too long; it takes away my power. Still, I know with absolute certainty that I cannot build the bridge by myself; I have to wait for the Creator to build it and show me the way. Yet even with the humbling knowledge that I cannot do it on my own, I am impatient. I want the control. \n\nAt this point in her story, Esther had been doing a lot of waiting. She had to wait and see if she would be chosen queen. She had to wait for the king and Haman to come to her banquet, and then she had to wait for her second banquet before asking if the king would save her people. Esther had to wait on God’s timing instead of relying on her own.\n\nIn a book where the name of God is never directly mentioned, God’s providence and all-encompassing power appear time after time. Esther goes before King Ahasuerus, nervous and unsure, but God’s presence went before her, as it does with us (Isaiah 45:2). God continues to be our refuge and our fortress in times of uncertainty and distress (Psalm 91:2). \n\nThough God’s presence was not explicitly stated in this scene with Esther, King Ahasuerus, and Haman, it is evident that He was there. He was there when Esther invited them to the banquet, there when she asked King Ahasuerus to save her people, and He was there in the midst of Esther’s fright and uncertainty. \n\nPerhaps when Esther first heard of Haman’s evil plot, she might have felt as if she were standing at the edge of a ravine. Unsure of where to go next, she simply had to wait for God to build the bridge and show her the way.\n\n And He did. He built the bridge, He led Esther across it, and He worked through Esther to save His people. God took Haman’s disastrous plan and turned it on its head, destroying Haman and restoring full life to the Jews so that they may proclaim His glory throughout the nations.\n\nEllen Taylor was born and raised in sweet home Alabama, but has called Nashville home since 2013.

My to-do list gets too long, and instead of just chipping away at it one item at a time, my stomach starts to hurt, my neck gets tight, and I just go back to bed. The rational thing to do is to simply move forward, pay the bills, write the essay I’m avoiding, and buck up. But I find that sometimes I just can’t muscle through. I find that my nose is raw from so much keeping to the grindstone. I can’t move forward for good or for ill. I am paralyzed.\n\nWe can get frozen in place when there’s too much to do, or even when there’s nothing to be done. In either case, panic and flight are the natural human responses to unfavorable circumstances. Both solve nothing, and both betray a lack of faith that God is in control. We find ourselves in that terrifying state of freezing indecision, yet He really only desires one thing: that we turn to Him in trust.\n\nTrust doesn’t mean we have to remain inactive. Often, trust means we must act. In those situations, God calls us to simply do the next right thing, and for the rest, cast our cares on Him (1 Peter 5:7). Do you have a ten-year plan? Good on you. Do you have no plans at all? That’s okay, too; start with the next right thing.\n\nEsther didn’t have a ten-year plan. Her future plans risked her neck, so she had every reason to be paralyzed by fear and indecision. But instead she cries out in agony, “How could I bear to see the disaster that would come on my people?” (Esther 8:6). Even though her enemy Haman had been dealt with, his evil plotting left behind a huge disaster and danger. Lives were at stake. How could her people be saved from destruction? In Esther’s case, King Ahasuerus turned matters over to Esther and Mordecai. \n\nThroughout Esther’s story, we have seen that so much has rested on favor. The favor the king showed Vashti, the favor he showed Esther, the favor the king showed Haman, the favor he showed Mordecai, then the favor he showed the Jews. This favor, of course, is often reversed. The king’s favoring of Vashti ended. Esther favored Haman by inviting him to the feast, but it was to his destruction. Mordecai was ignored, then favored. And finally, the Jews, once despised, were now favored of the king.\n\nAll of this favor is out of our control. Amidst flatteries and reversals, however, God’s favor for His people endures. The story of Esther is ultimately the story of God’s favor toward His people. It’s the story of Psalm 30:11-12: “You turned my lament into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness, so that I can sing to you and not be silent.”\n\nGod’s favor is the greatest surety there can be. We are called to trust Him and walk in obedience. We don’t need to give up and confine ourselves to bed, paralyzed by fear and indecision. We can move forward in confidence of God’s promises. If we trust ourselves to His care, we need not fear or be anxious. Though the whole world heave against us, or when everything is shrouded in darkness, He is King.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 9:1-22, Nehemiah 8:10, Luke 1:46-55\n\nWhen it comes to a blockbuster movie experience, I like to feel a tinge of tension. I don’t mind my emotions being pushed to the brink of disaster before the hero swoops in and saves the day—that is, while I’m sitting in a comfy seat with a jumbo tub of popcorn (extra butter, please). But in real life? Oh no. I’d rather play it safe. \n\nI don’t want to even come close to disaster, disappointment, or despair. I’d prefer to see God’s hand rescue me as soon as the thought that something could go wrong enters my mind. Wouldn’t you?\n\nGod knows this about us, and He knows what we need. His plan is always right on time. Never early. Never late. We see this play out among God’s people in the book of Esther. Haman’s evil edict of death was issued on the thirteenth day of the first month, sending God’s people into a panic (Esther 3:15). But deliverance did not come until the thirteenth day of the twelfth month. The only thing worse than panic is prolonged panic. Am I right? \n\nFor twelve long months God’s people must have pleaded with Him to rescue them. They must have worn paths in the kitchen floor pacing with worry. They must have resisted a million urges to run and hide the little ones they knew Haman had ordered to be killed. They must have fretted that God would not come through, worried they’d misunderstood His plan for them, or felt abandoned by the God who promised to protect them. \n\nDeliverance did not come twelve months early, or twelve weeks early, or twelve days early. \n\nDeliverance came “on the day when the Jews’ enemies had hoped to overpower them, just the opposite happened. The Jews overpowered those who hated them” (Esther 9:1). \n\nThat very day. \n\nThe second they arrived at the juncture they’d been dreading, the switch flipped, the tables turned, and their Great Deliverer delivered them from destruction. God’s people stood, ready to fight, eyeball to eyeball with their worst nightmare. God has promised He will care for us, but we cannot put grace to the side, storing it up for a moment we don’t want to face. \n\nWhen our enemies come for us, God will stand beside us. When our hearts are broken, God will be near (Psalm 34:18). When we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we will see His hand (Psalm 23:4). But we may find ourselves closer to suffering than we’d ever want to be, on our knees praying until they ache. Like Israel did as they fled their Egyptian oppressors (nearly 1,000 years before Esther pleaded for her people to be spared), we may feel the sting of a raging sea before us and hear the pounding of enemy chariots behind us before we are able to see God make a way. \n\nSo what do we do as we wait for our rescue? We stand firm in God’s promises, trusting that He will deliver us at exactly the right moment. We wait for His rescue. We wait on Him. Our God is able to shift our sorrow to gladness and our mourning into celebration (Esther 9:22). He will do it right on time, every time.\n\n\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nThings don’t always go according to plan.\n\nTake the summertime of 1812, for example. Paris was warm and beautiful, and Napoleon’s army was 600,000 men strong. He was on top of the world, but Russia’s Czar Alexander was really starting to get on his nerves. He ignored French trade embargos, and worse, refused to let Napoleon marry one of his sisters. Frustrated but confident, Napoleon made his most ambitious plan yet: take Moscow and show Alexander once and for all who was the greater ruler.\n\nNapoleon crossed from Poland into Russia, his vast army advancing deeper and deeper into the countryside as the Russian forces burned their crops and fled before him. But as he advanced, Napoleon’s supplies and men began to dwindle. And although he did finally limp into Moscow in October, the wind and snow had started to swirl and bite—winter was coming. With only a sixth of his men remaining, Napoleon had to retreat, defeated not by Russia’s military, but by her freezing, obliterating winter.\n\nIf you’ve ever engaged in a land war in Asia, or even parented small children, you know things hardly ever go as planned. So why do we continue to believe we can control our circumstances? History and personal experience prove God alone is in control. The Red Sea parted, Jericho’s walls collapsed, and fire fell on Mt. Carmel—we are not the ones running the show.\n\nHaman planned to crush the Jews (Esther 9:24). He wanted to destroy them. We’ve seen examples of this kind of horrific racism all throughout history. In every era, men have shown this evil instinct to destroy other men for being different. They lay their evil plans, perhaps prevailing for a time, but in the end, their plans fall flat. They may cast the dice, but God alone controls the outcome.\n\nIn our own failed Napoleonic aspirations we are quick to become frustrated, lamenting, “Nothing ever goes like I plan!” But every failed human plan is actually cause for thanksgiving, because all things happen according to the good pleasure of God’s will (Romans 8:28). Likewise, when the enemies of God approach, armed with malice and intent upon blood, we can still give thanks. God Himself is our defense, and we should not fail to celebrate His good providence in all things.\n\nAt the end of the book of Esther, the Jewish people celebrate God’s deliverance. They not only celebrate in the present, but they vow to celebrate in the future—to remember who they are and what God has done:\n\n“These days are remembered and celebrated by every generation, family, province, and city, so that these days of Purim will not lose their significance in Jewish life and their memory will not fade from their descendants.”\n\n– Esther 9:28\n\nMay we also remember. May we remember, with Solomon, that “The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps” (Proverbs 16:9). May our hearts respond in thanksgiving because He alone is God, and there is no one like Him (Isaiah 46:9). May we celebrate our freedom in Christ by remembering what we’ve been saved from, and Who has saved us from it.\n\nMake your plans, but rejoice and remember: it is the Lord who had a good plan for us before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4). Glory be to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nI’ve always been afraid of the book of Job.\n\nI’m afraid of Job’s story, the way I’m afraid of Abraham’s, and Mary’s, and the disciples’. I’m afraid the cost of following Jesus will be too much for me—unlike Abraham, who obeyed God and prepared his son for sacrifice; and Mary, who was willing to face scandal as an unwed mother; and Jesus’s first disciples, most of whom died as martyrs. I’m afraid that, when faced with the sharp rock of suffering, my faith will shatter like glass. I don’t trust my flesh, which I know will fail. I’m afraid to live fully, to love completely, and trust wholly. I am afraid to suffer.\n\nOf course, I have suffered a variety of wounds, as we all have. If there is a more common thread to humanity than suffering, I’m not sure I know it. And so Job’s story is, naturally, my story. And your story, and your neighbor’s story, and every member of your family’s story, and that person who served you coffee this morning’s story too. In chapter 42, Job’s story ends with the same stunningly beautiful conclusion we are all offered: repentance and restoration.\n\nJob cries out, “I know that you can do anything.… I reject my words and am sorry for them” (Job 42:2,6). He knows that God is just, merciful, and mighty to save. Job doesn’t expect to be made whole, to have everything and everyone he’s lost restored. It is enough for Job to know that God is God and he is not, and to repent of his own pride.\n\nIn chapters 38–41, God speaks. He proclaims His power, His justice, His righteousness, and His sovereignty over all things. It’s a “mic drop” moment, one that needs no punctuation, no follow up. But after Job’s cry of repentance, God responds once more to Job in a manner so kind and lavish that we are compelled to react with just as much awe and wonder as we did when we read that He breathed all creation out of nothing. Yes, God is mighty, unrivaled in power. Yes, God is sovereign, unrivaled in His commitment to justice. But also, Yes, God is good, and He promises us bountiful restoration.\n\nJob received restoration in his lifetime—his fortunes returned, his flocks and herds multiplied, his home filled with new children. Our suffering may not, and often does not, end with restoration in this life. Death wounds us, sickness steals from us, broken relationships limit our ability to trust, and tragedy on a global scale haunts even our happiest days. Our hope is not in the here and now. Ours is a future hope, formed and grounded in God’s Word, molded by His mercy, and secured by His Son.\n\nWe will experience the restoration and renewal of all things, as promised in Revelation 21:3–5. It is the only ending that makes sense to our stories of suffering, the kind and lavish response of a loving Father who promises, one day, to wipe every tear from our eyes.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nIn Night, the seminal autobiographical novel about his experience in Nazi concentration camps, writer Elie Wiesel says this: “Some of the men spoke of God: His mysterious ways, the sins of the Jewish people, and the redemption to come. As for me, I had ceased to pray. I concurred with Job! I was not denying His existence, but I doubted His absolute justice.”\n\nBecause it deeply resonated with his own experiences with tragedy and suffering, Wiesel publicly lectured on the book of Job throughout his career as a professor and Nobel Prize-winning author.\n\nAs I was researching Wiesel’s work on Job, I remembered reading Night in middle school. Then, I had a second thought, one that made my stomach drop and my eyes flood with tears. I realized that one day, my daughter is going to read Night. One day, she is going to find out about the Holocaust. She’ll read about about slavery and Jim Crow and 9/11. She’ll find out about war, famine, genocide, opioid overdoses, and school shootings. One day, she will learn about suffering. And even harder still to imagine, one day, she herself will suffer.\n\nWhere will God be when she learns about these things? And can I trust Him not only with my own suffering, but with my precious baby girl’s?\n\nWhen my heart wavers and falters on the edge of faith, brought on by suffering and fear, I know I cannot stand on my own feelings. I must stand in faith, which is a gift of the Spirit, and I must pray unceasingly for Him to strengthen it. I must stand on the unwavering, infallible Word of God. Here is what it teaches me:\n\n1) God is just and good. He controls the wind and waves, the leviathan and behemoth, and every living creature.\n\n2) His Son Jesus, who is God incarnate, knew suffering here on earth, just as we do. But the suffering He endured was infinitely greater than anything we might bear, as He took on the weight of the world’s sins.\n\nSuffering belongs to all of us, through all time. One of the gifts that comes with reading Job through the lens of the New Testament is knowing that his story of suffering is our story and that Jesus came to secure true righteousness for all who believe in Him.\n\nGod’s justice is absolute. In the depths of suffering, it is no wonder we question it. God speaks to Job, “Would you really challenge my justice? Would you declare me guilty to justify yourself?” (Job 40:8). Would we?\n\nWe can trust God with our suffering because He is the Creator and King of everything. But we can also trust God with our suffering because Jesus suffered, bearing all of our sorrows to the cross.\n\nHe himself bore our sicknesses, \n\nand he carried our pains; \n\nbut we in turn regarded him stricken, \n\nstruck down by God, and afflicted. \n\nBut he was pierced because of our rebellion, \n\ncrushed because of our iniquities; \n\npunishment for our peace was on him, \n\nand we are healed by his wounds (Isaiah 53:4–5).\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nA few days a week, our notoriously chaotic and tardy household experiences a mini miracle. Somehow, we make it downstairs in time to eat breakfast, and inevitably, my four-year-old daughter asks to listen to her favorite catechism songs. And before I’ve had one sip of coffee, it starts: kid voices, electronic synth background music, and “GOD IS THE CRE-A-TOR OF EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING!” Then it repeats, and repeats again, and even in my pre-caffeinated state, I’m aware and grateful that this will be the song my girl has stuck in her head all day.\n\n“What is God?” The answer to this question, in some form or fashion, is foundational to every Church creed. It’s also touched upon in the very first sentence of Scripture. Everything started from God, who has no beginning and no end. And implicit in the story of creation is the sheer goodness, creativity, and affection of our Maker.\n\nThis is the truth God thunders from the whirlwind when He appears to the long-suffering Job. His speech in chapters 38 and 39 hearkens back to the story of creation in Genesis chapter 1: God created the earth and sea, the light and dark, the weather, the stars, and the animals (Job 38:4–39:30).\n\nGod presents two challenges to Job during His speech, and these two chapters contain the first. God is essentially asking, Do you understand how all this was made? How it all works? He is challenging Job’s finite understanding with all these questions. He’s challenging Job’s focus on himself.\n\nGod is not finished with His speech, but the start of it is more than enough for Job to fall back into his place. He has been reminded of Who he is speaking to, and just what the Maker of heaven and earth is capable of doing. And we, like Job, can marvel at His majesty and find our provision in His mercy.\n\nThe Heidelberg Catechism, written in 1563, poses this question and answer about the first line of the Apostles” Creed:\n\nQuestion: What do you believe when you say,“I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth”?\n\nAnswer: That the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who out of nothing created heaven and earth and everything in them, who still upholds and rules them by his eternal counsel and providence, is my God and Father because of Christ the Son. I trust God so much that I do not doubt he will provide whatever I need for body and soul, and will turn to my good whatever adversity he sends upon me in this sad world. God is able to do this because he is almighty God and desires to do this because he is a faithful Father.\n\nGod is almighty and faithful, full of mercy and majesty, creativity and care. As He declares His infinite holiness in these chapters, He does so to one man, Job. But God’s message is an eternal, cosmic truth, an invitation for each of us to rest in the security of knowing that we, too, are intimately loved by our Creator.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nToday’s readings are about mercy and majesty, two perfect descriptors of our perfect God. He is indeed merciful, and He is the King. But toward the end of this book about suffering, these two truths stand on trial. God has yet to show mercy to Job. If He is King, and sovereign, and has dominion over everything, why has His faithful servant suffered so much?\n\nLike God Himself, weather is unpredictable, wild, and powerful. So when Elihu describes the power of God, he talks about the weather. “He says to the snow, ‘fall to the earth,’” and “Ice is formed by the breath of God,” and “He saturates clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.” The wild, untamable weather that, despite our most advanced radar and predictions, never does what we think it will—this weather is controlled by God, a testament to His sovereignty and majesty.\n\nI write this while most of the United States is gripped by deadly freezing temperatures, the lowest in a generation. I write this after seeing our local weather-people get utterly destroyed on Twitter because they missed a forecast for snow. And always, their defense is simply this: weather is WEATHER. It is, by its very nature, impossible to control. We can read the radar, the charts, the signs, but at the end of the day, weather does what weather wants. Or rather, weather does what God wants.\n\nBut God’s majesty does have boundaries, lines drawn by His character and His goodness. In 37:13 we read, “He causes this to happen for punishment, for his land, or for his faithful love” (emphasis added). In verse 23, we are told, “The Almighty—we cannot reach him—he is exalted in power! He will not violate justice and abundant righteousness.” God may be utterly other, higher than anything we can fathom, but He has bound Himself by His character. And His character, proclaimed by Elihu and written throughout the Scriptures, is steadfast and faithful love, justice, and abundant righteousness.\n\nThe answer to the question, Can we trust God in our suffering? is yes, because of His abundant righteousness. Yes, because of His perfect will and His unbreakable commitment to His people, to us.\n\nThe psalmist wrote:\n\nI wait for the LORD; I wait \n\nand put my hope in his word. \n\nI wait for the Lord \n\nmore than watchmen for the morning—\n\nmore than watchmen for the morning. \n\nIsrael, put your hope in the Lord. \n\nFor there is faithful love with the LORD, \n\nand with him is redemption in abundance (Psalm 130:5–7).\n\nWe can wait, and we can hope, even in the deepest suffering, because there is faithful love and redemption in abundance in the arms of our good Father.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nWhen I was a child in Sunday School, someone once told me that God answers our prayers in three ways: with a “yes,” a “no,” or a “not yet.” To be clear, I don’t think God’s answers are nearly as neat and tidy as that. His ways are mysterious, far bigger and more cosmic than we could ever perceive. As I look back on that teaching now, I wonder, What about when He just doesn’t answer? or What if His “answer” comes as painful, intense, soul-crushing silence? As for Job, he begins to wonder if God even hears him: “If only I had someone to hear my case! Here is my signature; let the Almighty answer me” (Job 31:35). But Job is not the only figure in Scripture who felt the absence of God.\n\nIn John 11, Jesus delays going to heal His friend Lazarus, who then dies. In response, his sister Martha tells Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died” (v.21). Martha had sent for Jesus, and His delay was silence in her ears.\n\nIn Psalm 13, David cries out, “How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?” (v.1). But in Psalm 55, David speaks with confidence that God really does hear him, even when he feels alone: “I complain and groan morning, noon, and night, and he hears my voice” (v.17).\n\nIn these chapters from Job, the young counselor Elihu is responding to Job’s cry for God to answer. He challenges Job’s pride, suggesting that God’s silence is in response to Job’s pride-filled assertions that he is righteous and does not deserve his situation. Elihu isn’t exactly compassionate toward Job, but he does speak some important truths about God.\n\nSometimes God is silent. Sometimes He speaks. But He is always just, the standard of all that is good and holy and right. He is the Almighty, the all-knowing, the only Author and Creator and Sustainer of our faith. As Elihu says, “It is impossible for God to do wrong, and for the Almighty to act unjustly” (Job 34:10).\n\nReading through the book of Job, this question has come to me again and again: Do you trust Him—even when He seems silent? My honest answer is that I try, but most of the time I fail.\n\nI see myself in Job, as he protests, “But I did everything right!”\n\nI see myself in Martha, blaming Jesus for not doing exactly what she wanted Him to do.\n\nI see myself in David, crushed by sin and desperate to see the Lord.\n\nIn all things—even His silence—do I trust that He still holds all things together? After all, He is God, and I am not. Therefore, “when God is silent, who can declare him guilty?” (Psalm 55:17). He does not answer to us.\n\nSo do I trust the One who spun out the stars, who exhaled Creation and all its glory? Do I trust the One who was born into the dark and cold, who wept blood in Gethsemane, who died a brutal death for me? My only response to His love is to offer mine in return, despite what I see or understand. I believe that one day, I’ll stand before my God in perfect peace, and all the fear and unbelief will be gone. Until then, His Word tells me that He is worthy of my hope and trust. He hears my cries and is not indifferent to my suffering, even when He seems silent.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nI recently had a conversation with a friend who is facing a trial at work. A co-worker spread a false rumor about her, and now my friend must defend herself and her character to her boss. We talked about how lonely and powerless the business of defending oneself can be.\n\nAt this point in Job’s trial, prosecutors Bildad and Eliphaz are winning. Although they have no evidence, they have made a strong case that Job has sinned and earned the punishment he is now suffering. Job has done his best to be his own defense attorney, defending his character to his prosecutors as well as to God. But his case is weak in the face of his dire circumstances, and the verdict seems to be leaning one way: Job has done something to deserve this punishment.\n\nEnter Elihu. Young in years but wise in spirit, Elihu pauses the impending verdict and suggests another way: “If there is an angel on his side…to be gracious and say, ‘Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom’” (Job 33:24–25).\n\nAfter reading those words, I breathed a sigh of relief. Finally someone is suggesting that Job doesn’t have to do anything to get himself out of this situation. He doesn’t have to plead with God or somehow correct the unrighteous behavior we still have no proof of. There is a third way in the form of ransom.\n\nElihu speaks of a gracious and loving God in these chapters, one who is willing to forgive, keep us from death, and ultimately restore us to righteousness (v.26). This is the God I have come to know through Jesus Christ, who is more than an angel—He is my Savior.\n\nWhereas both Job and my friend were innocent, the case brought against me is true. I have done wrong. I have sinned. There is no defense I could muster against that prosecution. Yet, by the blood of Christ, I have received the same ransom Elihu suggests here. Jesus is my defender so that I don’t have to defend myself.\n\nBecause of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ, Elihu’s hypothetical scenario is our everyday reality. We have a defender. We have a good Judge who has restored us to righteousness. Because of this, we walk in grace, not judgment. And we step forward without fear, knowing that when we one day see His face, it will be “with a shout of joy” (v.26).\n\n \n\n",

Worse, these onlookers were once far beneath Job on the social, economic, and moral ladder (Job 30:1). Now, they’re mocking him. Job falls into a unique type of despair caused when you are suffering but those around you are not.\n\nNo one was literally spitting on me, but I have certainly experienced scorn for my suffering from those around me. I experience it most on social media. Whenever I see a friend post about something she has that I don’t, but wish I did, I feel the scorn. A husband, a child, another book coming out—posts about these things can strike a sensitive nerve in me, a place that quietly suffers from loneliness, longing, and lack. Because of this, a simple engagement announcement, wedding photo, or book-cover reveal can feel like torture to my heart.\n\nUnlike the wicked men in our reading today, this mocking is completely unintentional on the part of my friends, but it still has the power to deepen my despair, not only because comparison is the thief of joy, but because the voice of the mockers convinces me that I am alone in my suffering. Everyone else’s life seems to be moving along according to plan. Mine is not.\n\nI wonder if Satan sent the mockers to Job, and I wonder if he did so knowing how frail we humans are in the face of loneliness. Suffering is difficult. Suffering alone is unbearable.\n\nPerhaps this would be Job’s tipping point. I would have understood if it was, but Job still cries out to God. It is a despairing cry, but a cry nonetheless: “I cry out to you for help, but You do not answer me” (Job 30:20). His words foreshadow the ultimate cry of despair when Christ hangs on a cross and asks, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” (Matthew 27:46).\n\nChrist suffered. Christ was mocked in that suffering. Christ felt forsaken by God. All of Christ’s work and ministry led to those hours of scorn on the cross. And yet, I continue to sit in my suffering, I look at the thriving lives of those around me, and I convince myself I am alone when the exact opposite is true.\n\nThis is why the companionship of Christ and the knowledge of His suffering are so important to hold onto in our darkest times. If we do not listen first to these truths, we will only hear the voices of the mockers telling us we are alone.\n\nBut you are not. We are not. Not in this. Not ever. Jesus has cried out on our behalf, and because of Him, we are not forsaken, not abandoned, and never forgotten in our suffering.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nI have a new addiction, and it’s called YouTube. A couple of weeks ago, my doctor prescribed a new diet for me. I got on YouTube to see if anyone had tried it and had any meal ideas. Approximately two-hundred million people have and they do. I watched approximately two-hundred million of their videos. Each day I visit again, hoping to learn more.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with looking up a recipe on YouTube, but when forty-five minutes have passed, and I’m still watching people talk about “What I Eat in a Day” or “How I Grocery Shop,” it could be that I am looking for more than a simple recipe. Like the gold and silver miners Job describes, I am probing the “dark recesses” for something valuable.\n\nIn today’s reading, Job describes the difficulty of finding and attaining wisdom. According to him, wisdom is invaluable, almost impossible to find, and only known to God (Job 28:20,13,23).\n\nThe way to wisdom. That is the ultimate aim of my search. To know what is good, right, and wise. And yet, I am looking for it in the wrong place. I am mining for gold, not wisdom.\n\nDo you know what happens after I spend forty-five minutes watching videos of chefs and health gurus? I don’t actually get more knowledgeable. I get more confused. With so many different opinions about what to eat and when, I don’t know whose voice to heed.\n\nJob’s quest for wisdom does not lead him to a certain location or web address. It leads him to Almighty God: “The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom. And to turn from evil is understanding” (Job 28:28).\n\nThough the internet will convince us otherwise, as Christ-followers, we have access to this wisdom and understanding. As Paul told the church in Corinth, “But it is from Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became God-given wisdom for us” (1 Corinthians 1:30).\n\nChrist is the physical manifestation of God-given wisdom, and with our knowledge of the Word and by the power of the Holy Spirit, we have access to this wisdom. The Gospels tell us how Jesus ministered, prayed, made decisions, and treated others. The Holy Spirit indwells us so that we can discern how to use Christ-like wisdom in our everyday lives.\n\nGod-given wisdom does not leave us confused. It does not make us question whose voice to heed or what to do. God-given wisdom is clear. It is written in the Word, and it has been written on our hearts. This is why forty-five minutes spent reading the Gospels does not create the same angst and confusion as forty-five minutes spent online.\n\nAs we venture out on our quests for wisdom, let us seek true, God-given wisdom. Let us turn first to the life of Christ. For if He is in you, so is wisdom.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nMy experience in the Christian life often feels like being on a train that’s traveling through the mountains. One minute the view out my window is crisp and clear. I am certain of how to do right in the eyes of God. But the next minute, I am in a tunnel, and the once-clear view goes dark. Life gets complicated, and I am not sure how to navigate it in a righteous way. In these times, I have often asked the questions that Bildad did: “How can a person be justified before God? How can one born of woman be pure?” (Job 25:4–5).\n\nInstead of directly answering Bildad’s question, Job replies with a list of acts that exemplify God’s power: “By His power He stirred the sea… By His breath the heavens gained their beauty” (Job 26:12–13). Similar to our reading from yesterday, it seems that Job is asking a better question now. Instead of how—How can man be righteous?—he asks who—Who is God? These questions might seem unrelated, but one must be asked before the other can be answered.\n\nA few years ago, during a tunnel season of intense anxiety, I felt like I could not see up from down. I wasn’t sure what I was doing right and what I was doing wrong. Thinking and analyzing my way through things wasn’t working; it simply increased my anxiety. Finally, I turned to what I knew. Each morning, I wrote down five things I knew to be true about God, even if I only believed it that day. I scrawled truths like, He is fighting for me. He is my Creator. And eventually I began to write, He is good.\n\nThis was not a quick fix for my anxiety, but it helped me weather the season until I came out the other side, and it taught me that when it comes to our own righteousness, the question is not how but who. When I am asking what to do, what is right, I need a friend to tell me, as Job told Bildad, “I will teach you about God’s power” (Job 27:11).\n\nThis is where our rightness begins, with a God who loves us, and in that love sent His Son to make us righteous. If we stand any chance of doing good on this earth, our actions must be motivated and sustained by that love—the love of Christ and of the Father who sent Him. It is the who that makes us good, not the how. And while the how may change as we grow and learn in faith, the who never does. The truth of Christ remains the same.\n\nMay we rest in God’s goodness today and let go of the quest for our own. For in the end it is all by His power; it is all by His breath.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nIn Eliphaz’s third and final speech, he accuses Job of wickedness. Grasping for a reason behind his friend’s suffering, Eliphaz must believe his friend has done something to deserve this. If he hadn’t, surely God would not have allowed this amount of suffering to befall him.\n\nHow quickly our faith reduces to a formula when in crisis. If I do good works for God, God will bless me, right? Job knew that no matter what he did or did not do, God “is unchangeable, who can oppose Him? He does what he desires” (Job 23:13). Which leaves us wondering, if the outcome will always be the same, why even bother with trying to do good?\n\nI recently moved into a house with a newly remodeled kitchen. It is neat and pristine on the surface, but I have learned that the pipes beneath it are not. Previous owners committed the cardinal sin against sinks. They put grease down the drain, and now I’m dealing with a clog.\n\nAs several different plumbers have come in and out of my home, I have learned that a beautiful kitchen is worthless if the pipes are bad. When it comes to kitchens, it is only what’s beneath the surface that allows everything to function, flow, and thrive. When it comes to us, it is the same.\n\nTo the church in Galatia, Paul wrote, “For whatever a person sows he will also reap, because the one who sows to his flesh will reap destruction from the flesh” (Galatians 6:7–8). For whatever a man puts down the drain, he will also see it come up again.\n\nGod cares about our good works, not because they affect His will—He is unchangeable, who can oppose Him?—but because they affect who we are. As Paul continues, saying, “the one who sows to his flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit” (v.8).\n\nWe must not get tired of doing good, not because our good deeds will lead to good circumstances, but because sowing goodness leads to a life of trusting in the Spirit—the type of life that can withstand trials with faith.\n\nJob seems to have the opposite problem of my kitchen. His life is in shambles, his kitchen a disaster zone, but the plumbing is clear. He is asking why, as we all would, but he is also asking a better question: where? Where is God in the struggle? “If only I knew how to find him,” he pleads, “so that I could go to His throne” (Job 23:3).\n\nThrough our great High Priest Jesus Christ, we have direct access to the throne room Job seeks. Because of this, although we can’t always be confident of the why, we can be confident of the where. Where is God in our suffering? Right there with us in the midst of it.\n\nWhatever suffering befalls you today, know that God is near. And His Spirit is allowing you to do good, so that even if your physical life is in shambles, you can be confident the life inside of you is eternal. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\n“Why do bad things happen to good people?”\n\nThis is a question we’ve all asked at some point in our lives. And up until this point in our reading of Job, it’s been the essential question. In other words, how else could Job’s excruciating circumstances be explained here, “on the ground”? (Job 1:20). No one sitting around Job had access to the heavenly scene you and I read in chapters 1 and 2, so how else were they to understand the human wreckage sitting right in front of them? As far as Job’s friends were concerned, the only possibly explanation was that Job must have committed some egregious sin.\n\nJob and his friends did have the same fundamental theological framework. With this in mind, they reasoned that if people are good, they can expect God to be good to them in return. (This also sounds an awful lot like a message from today’s culture.) Sinful behavior, on the other hand, results in disastrous consequences. (We see this laced throughout God’s instructions at Sinai, emphasized by the prophets, and threaded throughout later books as well.) But this a human expectation. We believe life is supposed to be fair. Turns out, it’s not—which is why we hear the steady drumbeat of this question throughout Job: “Why do bad things happen to good people?”\n\nIn this chapter, that question gets turned somewhat on its head, inverted: “Why do good things keep happening to bad people?” Why are some wealthy and seemingly untroubled while others struggle day in and day out? In our cultural terms, we wonder how someone can afford to travel abroad to exotic places while others have to work three jobs, struggling to keep food on the table. Why do some people seem to lead such peaceful lives? How do some get away with blatantly rejecting God? None of it seems fair.\n\nZophar’s emphatic response was this: the sinful may lead lives that look just peachy on the outside, but it’s all fleeting (ch. 20). Those who mistreat the poor and greedily hoard everything in sight—in the end, they will be crushed under God’s judgment and end up in the terror of utter darkness. Job’s response to this? Basically, “Yeah, right.” From what he had seen, the lives of immoral people were often golden. Their families were fine, they lived in security, and they were prosperous.\n\nLetting the wicked get off scot free is not justice, Job reasoned. Most of us would agree with him, I suspect, as we watch all kinds of contemporary injustices parade across our television screens daily. But Job’s observations—while spot-on, to be sure—are not the only perspective. Scripture gives us another view, another way to regard the wicked who seem to flourish in this world. As the psalmist declared, it is only for a season. Those who wait on the Lord, those who hope in Him, will see justice (Psalm 37:34–36). And it is in the waiting that we, like Job, must trust in God and His righteous character, rather than trusting in what we perceive with our own eyes.\n\nElaine A.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nIn the wake of Bildad’s second speech (Job 18)—a terrifying description of the darkness, entrapment, and utter destruction awaiting the wicked—Job lamented. He returned his focus once again to how God had destroyed him in every way. He mourned his lost hope and the feeling of being trapped in his circumstances (Job 19:10,12). He lamented that he was a physical wreck and that all of his household—relatives, guests, servants, and even his own wife—now despised him (vv.13–19,20).\n\nIn other words, Job’s extreme suffering continued. But now it was interlaced with crushing social abandonment. Nevertheless, what Job said next stands as a radical alternative to despair:\n\n“But I know that my Redeemer lives” (v.25).\n\nA “redeemer” was a family member who bought back persons or property that had been lost to the family due to poverty. We know the practice well from the selfless action of Boaz, when he redeemed the property of Naomi’s family and married the widowed Ruth. We know of the redemption and deliverance of God’s people Israel from their enslavement in Egypt. And we remember how Isaiah repeatedly called the Lord “God of Israel,” “the Redeemer,” and “the Holy One of Israel.”\n\nJob’s own declaration about God is woven within this same rich tapestry of faith. Having just said that his own relatives, or “kin,” had completely deserted him, Job fully affirmed that his “kinsman-redeemer,” his God, would not fail to rise up to vindicate and buy him back. “But I know” tells us something about Job’s confidence in God—so much so, that he asked that his words be inscribed as a witness for the future (vv.23–24)—and so they were!\n\nJob’s profound vow of hope continues on as he proclaims that he will see his Redeemer:\n\n“Even after my skin has been destroyed,\n\nyet I will see God in my flesh.\n\nI will see him myself;\n\nmy eyes will look at him, and not as a stranger. \n\nMy heart longs within me (vv.26–27).”\n\nPerhaps he was echoing the symbolism of dust from Genesis 3, or maybe he anticipated restoration from his present illness (2:8;7:5). Regardless, his words are telling: he knew God would remain faithful. The bottom line is this: Job affirmed that he would see God. He was clinging to the truth that he knew. Seeing his Redeemer was what Job wanted more than anything else, and indeed he did, as we will read later in the book (ch. 38–41).\n\nThe beauty of this beloved passage lies in a paradox. On one hand, we see the ambiguity of never really knowing how or when our pain, suffering, and weariness will end. But on the other, we see Job’s fierce, unwavering hope. Hope compelled him forward, re-anchoring and recentering him to his faith. May we learn to do the same. Let us trust in the name of the Lord, relying on Him alone (Isaiah 50:10).\n\nElaine A.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nHow many times has some very well-meaning person tried to assuage your heartache with words, saying something along the lines of this: “God will comfort you and see you through this. He always does.” Or this: “Just hang in there. Evil people always get what they deserve.”\n\nLook closely, and you’ll see those two sentiments are basically parts of Eliphaz’s second conversation with Job. So why are they a problem? Well, for one thing, the latter suggests that Job must be evil too—why else would he be suffering badly? Their conversation leads to the question: How do we truly weep with, mourn with, and comfort those who are broken? How do we become true comforters? (Romans 12:15).\n\nFirst, we need to read and truly absorb Job’s scorching honesty in chapters 16 and 17, where the stakes are even higher. Just a reminder: God refused to allow Satan to take Job’s life, which means Job’s torment was as bad as it could possibly get with no relief anywhere, falling just short of death—and Job couldn’t exactly turn to morphine to numb the pain. So now the question becomes one of self-reflection: If we are the ones in the fiery furnace, how do we cling to our relationship with God when it feels as if it is all going up in smoke?\n\nThese two questions are tied together, because those who weep and mourn most effectively will have climbed into that fiery furnace of suffering in some way. In doing so, they join the “Jobs” of the world. So for both situations, we wonder:\n\nWhat does true faithfulness look like, both for the one who comforts and the one who suffers? \n\nWhat part does prayer play in our suffering? \n\nWhat does it mean to bring all our emotions—even our anger, doubt, and feelings of betrayal—before God?\n\nAfter all, Job’s protests were laced with accusations. If his suffering teaches us anything, it is to strip away all pretenses—physical and spiritual. God had worn out and torn up Job, seized him by the neck and dashed him to pieces to the point that Job’s face was red from weeping (Job 16:7–9,12,16). His dark anger boiled over in agonizing questions, as he protested the stony silence of God.\n\nStill, more than anything else, Job longed for his shattered relationship with God to be mended. He’d already sought out a mediator to bring them together (9:33–35; 16:21). He also repeatedly begged to talk with God—which he ultimately did in the most extraordinary of circumstances. Most importantly, Job returned to this understanding: his “advocate” and “witness” were set apart on high (16:19). Job remembered who he was and who he was not—he was not God. All of this points to Job’s faithfulness and his very real relationship with God.\n\nSo how do we sit with someone in their despair? How do we pray in the midst of others’ suffering, as well as our own? In my own experience, words like “Lord have mercy! Christ have Mercy!” bring me back to the truth of God’s character, of both His unfailing lovingkindness and ultimate sovereignty through Jesus Christ. Our Savior reaches through our blinding pain to comfort and deliver us. Our prayer for mercy, offered with humility and hope, binds us together before the God who comforts, even from on high.\n\nElaine A.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nWhere does Job’s hope lie, and where does our own?\n\nPause for a moment to reflect back on one of your darkest times. Perhaps you tossed and turned for sleepless nights, futilely attempting to unravel the tangled web created by bad decisions. Perhaps you agonized over a bitter and angry child. Perhaps physical pain incessantly pierced and jabbed at you. Perhaps… Perhaps. No matter what our individual calamities, each one of us has been (or will someday be) there with Job, drained of strength and courage to face even the next hour. Where can we turn? Where can we place our hope? And how?\n\nWe may have to venture outside Job chapters 13 and 14 to knit together those slender strands that constitute hope, especially in the midst of the unrelenting pain that chews away at every part of our lives. At this point in his terrible journey, Job contrasted human hope (quite unfavorably) to a chopped down tree. Even though the tree had been destroyed, it sprouted again when watered—not so, with those who sleep in death (14:7–12). With great courage, Job had previously declared that he was prepared to defend himself before God, knowing full well that no godless person could stand in His presence (13:15–16). But like most of our courageous statements, Job’s expectations faded almost as quickly as he spoke them. He was back in the gloom of his torment and suffering. For Job, the steady and irreversible disintegration of mountains and rock in the natural world were a fitting metaphor for the erosion of his hope (14:18–19).\n\nOf course, that is not the end of Job’s story—or ours. We affirm with saints through the ages that our faithful God does restore our lives and comfort us in our pain (Psalm 71:20–21). We believe we will be carried through the deep waters and the ravaging fire (Isaiah 43:1–2). We hold fast to the hope that Jesus is the resurrection and the life (John 11:25–26). And we believe God has the power to do all He’s promised to do (Romans 4:20–24). This means that if we are in Christ Jesus, we have crossed over from death to life—even now! (John 5:24–25). Did you catch that? It’s a truth worth repeating, this time with the apostle Paul’s words, who tells us that right now, this very moment, we are seated in the heavenly realms with Jesus (Ephesians 2:6).\n\nHow do we respond? I confess I’m tempted to be a bit skeptical from time to time. You too? Thankfully, there is another path on which to set out at this point. Even from the crucible of our suffering and discouragement, we can take up the mantle of the psalmist. We have the privilege of declaring God’s goodness, of proclaiming the richness of God’s immeasurable and precious grace, and of being increasingly thankful (Psalm 71:14–18). Gratitude trumps grumpiness—every time, in all circumstances. The Apostle Paul affirmed that as well, saying, “Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus” (1 Thessalonians 5:18).\n\nElaine A.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nHere’s a question: Can anything good come out of the mouths of Job’s friends? I don’t know about you, but I occasionally find myself thinking (dismissively), “Yes, but one of Job’s friends said that.” The subtext is that we can safely skim over what they said and then move on. The three friends, however, had some extraordinarily good theology; it just happens to have been misapplied.\n\nThe three “friends,” “comforters,” or whatever we label those well-meaning fellows, arrived from afar in order to weep, mourn, and sit silently with Job. Their intentions were noble—until they started to speak! After they sat silently with Job for a whole week, Job set them back on their heels with a deeply troubling lament. In response, the first two friends tried to cajole Job into confession and repentance, but he would have none of it. His response was to ask why God was so cruelly oppressing him, which had left him longing for the darkness of the grave.\n\nWhat do we say in response to that kind of raw pain? When we find ourselves in such circumstances, we stumble about, trying to be “meaningful” in our comforting. Toward that same end, Zophar ventured in, declaring that God is utterly transcendent and all-powerful beyond the highest heaven and the depths of the grave. This is true, but a gnawing question remains: how can we really wrap our minds (and hearts) around this majestic, sovereign transcendence of God? And then how do we talk about it, especially when we are face to face with seemingly interminable agony? How can we assure suffering friends that our God is both exalted far above all earthly powers and, at the same time, relentlessly and intimately loving? What comfort lies in that combination?\n\nZophar’s next words head down the path we so often take. Having professed the mystery of God’s ways, Zophar proceeded to speak for God, promising an array of hopeful results—if Job would just confess his sins!\n\nIt is no wonder Job was unimpressed. At the same time, he picked up on the most important part of what Zophar said and fleshed out his own perspective on it. Job indeed knew that nothing in God’s universe was outside God’s control, but he had come to know the dark side of that—devastation of land, degradation of the rich and powerful, whole nations destroyed and dispersed. The upshot for Job was that God was responsible for his suffering in that He allowed it. This is bold honesty. And that is where we need to be, frightening as it might actually be to say (and hear) these things. But we must remember that in the end, God affirmed what Job had said (Job 42:7–8). May that be a profound encouragement to us as we wrestle with how to express the truth of suffering.\n\nElaine A.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nOne of my kids got into trouble last week, and it was that kind of interesting trouble all the other kids love to talk about. Juicy trouble is everyone’s favorite kind of trouble. So his siblings talked, and he was furious at the humiliating injustice of being talked about. I overheard my husband trying to explain to him that if he had acted justly in the first place, the others would have nothing to say.\n\nMy little fella isn’t alone. We are all inclined to think that we are right and everyone else is wrong. We like our own version of justice. We are quick to condemn the faults of others and justify ourselves. But we cannot be our own standard of justice, because we are finite and fallen.\n\nThis is why it’s hard to understand the book of Job. Bildad’s perspective is more familiar than Job’s, because like Bildad, we redefine righteousness to suit our own ends and try to treat justice like karma. Want to know who has sinned? Look and see how they “got what was coming to them.” But justice isn’t karma. It’s a mistake to assume that when something good happens to us, it is because we’ve been good. When we hum along with The Sound of Music’s Fraulein Maria, saying, “Nothing comes from nothing… I must have done something good,” we are singing the same tune as Bildad.\n\nInstead of basing our outcomes on our actions, Job points out two things. First, justice is God’s, not ours: “Even if I were in the right, I could not answer. I could only beg my Judge for mercy” (Job 9:15). God is the righteous one. When He acts, no one can condemn Him. No one can contend with Him. This is uncomfortable, because we like justice to be defined our way.\n\nSecond, God is sovereign. Whether things go right or seemingly wrong for us, God is still in control. Nothing happens outside of His will. “If it isn’t he, then who is it?” Job asks rhetorically (v.24). We’ve already glimpsed into the heavens at the beginning of Job, where God gives Satan permission to torment a righteous man. God’s sovereignty is uncomfortable, especially when the wicked seem to succeed and the righteous suffer.\n\nSo we struggle with questions like these: “Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?” (8:3). The clear answer is a resounding “No!” God’s thoughts are higher than ours, and His ways higher than ours, and we cannot answer or contend with Him (Isaiah 55:8–9).\n\nLike Job, we want to know why God allows bad things to happen (Job 10:18). But there are a lot of things we don’t get to know in this life. It shouldn’t surprise us that we cannot fully comprehend the Almighty, that He doesn’t bow to our will. But there is good news: God is good, and we are safe in His care (v.12). We need not fear. When we, like children, don’t see the whole picture, we can still trust that God’s justice is good because He is good, and He cares for us.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Lisa Harper\n\nOne of my favorite lecture series from my first seminary experience (I’ve recently begun a second seminary adventure at the “mature” age of 55!) was about having a “high view” of God. We had lively discussions in class regarding how, in our modern era’s quest to make the gospel relevant, we’ve all but lost the kind of deep reverence prophets like Isaiah and psalmists like David displayed toward God. In our bumper-sticker theology, “God is my copilot” culture, we’ve unwittingly minimized the omniscience and omnipotence of the Alpha and Omega in an attempt to make Him more accessible.\n\nI remember being so convicted during those classes, realizing I didn’t revere God the way I should. I committed to being more circumspect in how I addressed Him in prayer and even how I carried His Word, holding my Bible as a precious treasure instead of carelessly shoving it into a suitcase or tossing it into the back seat of the car. I still hold to those convictions.\n\nHowever, as I look back over my walk of faith in the 20-plus years since that class, it’s clear I’ve often overcorrected, swinging into the opposite side of the doctrinal ditch. I didn’t always have the spiritual maturity to understand that having a high view of God doesn’t mean we need to have a degrading view of ourselves. Of course, humans are wicked and depraved apart from divine grace, but after we put our faith and hope in Jesus Christ, we’re allowed to shrug into His robes of righteousness, knowing we have been adopted into the family of God as full heirs! (Romans 8:14–17). A high view of God should open believers’ hearts and minds to what our heavenly Father says about us, His beloved children.\n\nNow, if we give Job’s three friends a big benefit of doubt, we can assume they had mostly good intentions when they delivered their self-righteous lectures. However, like a young seminarian armed with more head knowledge than spiritual maturity, their arrows missed the mark by a country mile!\n\nJob understands the situation well. He says, “What strength do I have, that I should continue to hope? What is my future, that I should be patient?… Since I cannot help myself, the hope for success has been banished from me” (6:11,13). Job cannot change his bleak situation, despite his innocence.\n\nBut that’s the point. Job’s friends recognized the frailty of humanity and our propensity to sin, but their view of God is way too small. Without the context of God’s redemptive grace, we still make everything about us! In Romans 8, Paul points to the future, complete redemption of all creation as our hope in the midst of present suffering. Though we are currently “subject to futility,” all things will one day be fully “set free from the bondage” into “glorious freedom” (Romans 8:20). This is our hope.\n\n“Now in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience” (Romans 8:24–25).\n\nJob’s friends got the frailty of humanity part right, but their concept of God’s attention missed His compassionate heart. The Lord was Job’s only hope, just as He is ours. With Christ, our mere humanity is transformed into glory befitting children of God, no matter what suffering we may be experiencing at the moment.\n\nEditor’s Note: Devotional was edited at 11:00 am on 3/14/19.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Lisa Harper\n\nSoon after my parents divorced, Dad remarried. Then, he moved out of the city to forty-two acres of flat, cactus-dotted pastureland in Central Florida to pursue his dream of becoming a cattleman-rancher. I loved helping Dad take care of our small herd, especially a solid black calf we named “Inky,” whose mama died while giving birth to him. I nursed Inky with a bottle until he got strong enough to fend for himself. But it wasn’t long before that baby Hereford bonded to me and no longer wanted to stay in the pasture with the rest of the cows. Instead, he followed me around like an oversized puppy, curled up and sleeping outside the house with the our pack of snoring dogs, who completely accepted him despite the fact that he mooed rather than barked.\n\nWhen my sweet baby bull was about a year old, Dad told me it was time to assimilate him back into the pasture with the herd. I cried, insisting that he didn’t know how to be a cow anymore because he’d become part of our family. But Dad gently encouraged me to think of what was best for Inky, and so I relented. Sadly, not long after we transitioned him from pet back to farm animal, a pack of rabid dogs attacked and killed several cows in the herd, including Inky. And while Inky was a yearling big enough to defend himself, he probably didn’t because he saw dogs as friends, not as potentially dangerous foes. I was inconsolable, devastated by the realization that had I not turned Inky into a pet, he might not have been savagely attacked and killed. My less-than-tender stepmother, however, was annoyed at my grief over a “stupid cow.”\n\nI was just an 11-year-old girl at the time of that mini-tragedy, but that’s when I learned that grief is not an inclusive emotion. Deep ache tends to be an isolating event, and despair tends to put uncomfortable distance between the heartbroken and observers—especially if those observers haven’t processed their own grief and loss. It reminds me of American poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox’s most observed and enduring line: “Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep, and you weep alone.”\n\nJob certainly walked “the narrow aisles of pain” in solitude. Before the prologue of his story was even finished, he’d lost almost everyone who really mattered to him, except for his wife—who was more salt-in-his-wounds than a comfort at this point—and three so-called friends (Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar), a trio who quickly revealed their distaste for Job’s honest despair, distancing themselves from the awkward messiness of his grief with condescending admonitions. The low-blow gist of his loquacious buddy Eliphaz in chapters 4 and 5 is this: Job, you obviously have hidden sin in your life. That’s why you’re in this pit of destruction. So you may as well quit whining, because no one’s even listening to your prayers!\n\nWhen my stepmother callously referred to Inky as a “stupid cow,” she was technically correct; bovine creatures don’t have nearly as high of an intellectual capacity as humans. However, she was oblivious to the fact that I had a real bond with that baby bull, which is why she could so easily dismiss my grief as adolescent drama. And that’s essentially the chasm that becomes apparent between Job and his three miserable comforters. Not all of what they say to Job is technically wrong. In fact, most of what they say about God’s inscrutability is accurate in principle. But the spirit of their preaching is crooked because they ignore the fact that Job has a real relationship with God. And the messy, wildly honest grievances he airs actually prove the very real existence of that bond.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Lisa Harper\n\nI once had a surgeon tell me I wasn’t a very good patient because I tried to “gut it out,” instead of being honest about the pain I was experiencing. Apparently, it’s hard on a healer when a patient masks their symptoms; making a diagnosis can become a bit like trying to shoot at a moving target.\n\nMy doctor believed my stubborn refusal to admit pain reflected my lack of trust in his competence as a physician. In Job chapter three, we see that Job is honest about his own pain, which is a clear indicator that he truly wants to be healed and trusts in the competence of the Great Physician. It would take me a long time to learn that instead of exacerbating a painful experience, honest tears and the acknowledgment of pain can actually serve as a soothing pressure relief valve.\n\nBy contrast, between the amped-up sensation of reality television, the shrieking discord of current political affairs, and the twenty-four/seven barrage of social media that has saturated our culture, it’s entirely possible for real trauma and suffering to go unnoticed and untended. We rush to triage emotional hangnails but completely ignore the people around us who are bleeding out. Silence doesn’t always indicate bravery, but it is a pretty good indicator that we might not notice when someone is truly suffering.\n\nJob’s outburst is a healthy reminder that our Redeemer doesn’t rank our emotions on a scale from good to bad, allowing only “good” emotions like joy and peace while barring “bad” emotions like grief and disappointment. We do not have to censor ourselves before the God who knows our hearts better than we do. Scripture doesn’t instruct us to smile on the outside while we die on the inside—just the opposite, in fact (see 1 Samuel 1). Frankly, I believe one of the biggest fallacies perpetrated in communities of faith is that the closer we get to Jesus, the more we need to keep a lid on it. Stoicism is not a spiritual gift, y’all!\n\nWe need to understand there’s a colossal difference between disagreeing with God and denying His existence altogether. Job cursed the day he was born and expressed confusion, frustration, and even anger, at God over allowing tragedy to befall him—but he did not reject God. In fact, the tormented exasperation Job hurls toward God proves that he is anything but an atheist! He knows God holds all things together.\n\nFaith powered by God can stretch us far beyond our own capacity to endure. Still, it’s not our anguish that distances us from God; it’s our apathy. The main takeaway from Job chapter three: we can and should continue to bring all of who we are—including our anger, confusion, and disappointment—before God. We can trust Him with every piece of our hearts.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Lisa Harper\n\nDealing honestly, wisely, and compassionately with human pain is an integral part of our job description as followers of Jesus Christ. No one gets through this life unscathed. Everyone deals with pain and suffering at some level. If someone insists she hasn’t, she’s either lying, in denial, or has amnesia. And since God’s second most important command is for us to love our neighbors as we love ourselves, it behooves us to learn how to better comfort ourselves as well as our neighbors—both those we rub shoulders with daily, and also our global neighbors, who make up the lost and dying world we’re called to care for.\n\nBut let’s deal with the proverbial bull in the china shop, which is the fact that what happened to Job wasn’t what we like to think of as “fair.” I mean, goodnight! The very beginning of this Old Testament book describes Job as a really good guy who was doing really good things with his life. The mention of Job rising early to pray for his kids (Job 1:5) is a common Hebrew idiom denoting a conscientious habit, which means praying for his family was something he did consistently.\n\nReading about this righteous guy losing pretty much everything—his wealth, his health, and all ten of his children—it’s like biting into a warm brownie and breaking your tooth on a rock. This “divine test” is surprisingly unfair. Surely Job didn’t deserve such devastating loss.\n\nIn the New Testament, Jesus blows the idea of human deservedness right out of the water. In His Sermon on the Mount, He teaches that God throws fairness out the window to bless even the unrighteous (Matthew 5:43–45). In another place, He explains that bad things do indeed happen to good people (Luke 13:1–5). And in His parable about the workers in the vineyard (Matthew 20:1–16), He thoroughly deconstructs any notion that we can earn God’s blessings.\n\nThe bottom line is this: No matter how many Bible studies we’ve done, or meals we’ve served to the homeless, we cannot earn one of those immunity sticks like they do on Survivor. None of us can get “good enough” to shield ourselves and those we love from suffering. Job proves that “good” people, including people of faith, can and do experience horrific things through no particular fault of their own. And if you want to really blow your mental hard drive, reread Job chapter 1, which suggests that while Job’s faith was truly strong, it did not safeguard him from hardship (v.8).\n\nIn the economy of God, Job’s suffering was an honor, a privilege. After all, “should we accept only good from God and not adversity?” (2:10). Our Creator and Redeemer handpicked Job for the honorable position of carrying the weight of pain. While God is not the author of evil (Psalm 5:4), He did choose Job with the foreknowledge that he would carry suffering well, because even our pain is a great conduit for God’s glory.\n\nCan you imagine how different our lives could be if we began to view some of our pain and disappointment as a divine privilege? What if we saw a difficult journey as one God handpicked us to take, knowing that He Himself would strengthen us to make the trek, and more importantly, that His glory would be illuminated through our efforts? Changing our perspective on suffering—viewing it as an honor instead of dumb luck or cruelty—could absolutely change the course of our lives and deeply impact the world around us.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer Praising God’s Greatness",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 145:1-21\n\nPrayer is a startling invitation—one that, after 30 years of following Jesus, I still struggle to accept. \n\n“Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and incomprehensible things you do not know,” the Lord says to His people in Jeremiah 33:3. The book of Hebrews urges the Christ follower to “approach the throne of grace with boldness” (4:16), and Paul tells the Philippians not to worry about anything, but instead to petition God in prayer (4:6). Perhaps most astonishing of all, Jesus Himself instructs His disciples, “Whenever you pray, say, Father…” (Luke 11:2). \n\nCall out to God. Go boldly to the throne. Ask instead of worry. Talk to God as your Father. \n\nThis is the invitation. But what do we say? How do we find the words to pray? \n\nPrayer, like everything else in the Christian life, is a practice learned over time. When it comes to learning the language of prayer, there is no better classroom than the Psalms. The book of Psalms was the hymn and prayer book for the people of God before the days of Jesus. God’s people have been praying these writings, and using them to shape their own prayers, ever since. \n\nTake Psalm 145, for example. This hymn written thousands of years ago by the shepherd-king David teaches me how to express praise to a God who is magnificent beyond words. I often fumble at the beginning of my prayers, unsure how to address this Being who is so holy and so wholly other. But this psalm puts words to God’s greatness, giving me vocabulary to praise the Lord’s “splendor and glorious majesty” and declare His “awe-inspiring acts” (vv.5–6). It reminds me of the power of speaking back to God the immutable aspects of His character: He is “gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in faithful love” (v.8); He is “good to everyone” and “gracious in all His actions” (vv. 9,13). It gives me the scaffolding on which to build my own song of prayer to the Lord who is “near to all who call out to him, all who call out to him with integrity” (v.18).\n\nIn this three-week Psalms for Prayer reading plan, we’ll read fifteen psalms that cover a range of topics, from glorifying God, to praying for our personal concerns, to lifting up the needs of this world. Some of these psalms are worded as prayers offered directly to God; others act as prompts to inspire prayer. All are given to us in God’s complete, inerrant Word. The God to whom David wrote this ancient psalm is the same God you and I pray to today. His Word not only teaches us who He is; it teaches us how to commune with Him in prayer.\n\nMay God use our time in these psalms to reveal to us more of His character. May He draw us into a daily and ongoing conversation with Him, and may His Word teach us to express our hearts to Him in prayer.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 104:1-35\n\nI think children often imagine themselves as the center of all things, even the weather. And I think there’s something commendable about their curiosity, how they can attune their hearts and minds to what surrounds them. Psalm 104 gives me the impression that this is a God-inspired curiosity. Here, the psalmist wills his own soul to consider the beauty and majesty of God, and in doing so, his soul is moved to worship our Creator and admire His creation. \n\nHow countless are your works, Lord!\n\nIn wisdom you have made them all;\n\nthe earth is full of your creatures (v.24).\n\nIn truth, it is the Creator who is at the center of creation. God’s glory is revealed in what He has made: in the intricate and majestic beauty of His creation surrounding us. His artistic display is also wrapped up in His very essence, His radiant splendor, and His steadfast character. He wears His creation like a garment and commands it masterfully, setting up the edges between water and land, day and night. His boundaries are loving and lavish. Every green leaf and delicate creek seems full to the brim, right up to the edge of wherever He has ordered it to stop.  \n\nGod Himself takes pleasure in His own creation because it is an expression of His glory, and as His image-bearers, we too, ought to delight in what He has created (vv.31,33). And just as He is everlasting, His works will never cease to praise Him. “He established the earth on its foundations; it will never be shaken” (Isaiah 40:28; Psalm 104:5).\n\nHe wraps Himself in the beauty of creation because He is the holy, nourishing, life-giving presence inside the beautiful cup of creation. His Son Jesus was poured out for us that we may be filled with the finest provision of all—our salvation (Isaiah 53; 1 Corinthians 11). When we take communion, we remember with all our senses that He is our nourishment, that He alone gives abundant life. He alone sustains us, forgives us, and makes us new.\n\n In this mystery, we are planted on this earth, given an address, and we also find ourselves wrapped in the beauty of His creation—from the moment we walk out our front door in the morning to feel the fresh air on our faces and hear the birds singing their morning song. Even this is His provision for us, just as we are nourished daily by His Holy Spirit, feed on His Word, and walk in His presence. \n\nOur God makes Himself known to us in the song of creation and has demonstrated His splendor in every wild beast, in the sound the thunder, in the messages of the wind, and in the blue sky canopy above us. In all of this and more, from start to finish, my heart sings out in celebration with the psalmist to say, “Bless the Lord, O my soul! Praise the Lord!” (v.35).\n\nSandra McCracken is a singer, songwriter, and producer from Nashville, TN.

    "devo_title": "A Prayer for When God Seems Silent",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 77:1-20\n\nI got the call on a Tuesday. The son we were going to graft into our family through adoption was now staying with his biological family, to be raised by his grandmother. I had already packed a bag for the hospital. We were less than a week away from his due date, and now, there was no due date in sight.\n\nIt’s hard to describe the pain of that moment. Four years of infertility. Months of adoption preparation. All the finances invested in growing our family disappeared in an instant, but that paled in comparison to watching our future go up in smoke. The little boy I’d pictured standing between my husband and me, with this dark skin and curled hair, was gone. The thoughts kept pounding at the place between my eyes: I’ll never know what he looks like. I’ll never even know his name.\n\nI’ll be honest: in the moments after that call, I didn’t open up the psalms. Instead, I walked upstairs to the little nursery we’d yet to complete and grabbed the handmade quilt my mother’s best friend had made for the boy. It was meant to warm him as he slept, but now I buried my face in it and wept. I screamed. No one was home but me, and so I let myself go—until my throat quivered and the cries sounded eerily like that of a child wailing for its mother. \n\nThe Message translation of Psalm 77 says, “I yell out to my God, I yell with all my might, I yell at the top of my lungs… my life was an open wound that wouldn’t heal” (vv. 1-2). I know what that feels like. I’d guess many of us do. But how often do we give ourselves permission to yell and cry out like this? How often do we express our sorrow and the fullness of our pain? Not often. \n\nIn an effort to bypass our grief—in fear that God’s silence will be too much to bear—I believe many of us never ask the questions the psalmist so brutally lays down: Where are you, God? Have you forgotten me completely? I thought you were supposed to be compassionate. But this doesn’t feel like compassion.\n\nInstead, we try to end the pain as quickly as possible, either through secular comfort (read: retail therapy) or spiritual practices (read: small groups, counseling, meditation, and yes, sometimes even Bible reading). But Psalm 77 shows us that we can bring our raw emotion to God. We can ask our honest questions without fear. We can scream at the top of our lungs, and God will still listen.\n\nBut the psalmist does not stop with his questions. He asks them, and then he gets up off the floor. It is essential that we bring our honest selves to God, in all our brokenness. But it is just as essential that we are honest about who God is to us. In a place of pain, truth is a hard pill to swallow. But it is the medicine we need most. We need to remember that all His ways are good, even in the midst of our sorrow and pain. The Message translation of the psalm goes on to say:\n\nOnce again I’ll go over what God has done, lay out on the table the ancient wonders;\n\nI’ll ponder all the things you’ve accomplished, and give a long, loving look at your acts (vv. 11-12).\n\nI have a history full of examples to pick from to remember God’s character. After all, the psalmist didn’t know Moses and Aaron—he wasn’t present when God parted the Red Sea—but he praised God for it anyway. Jesus hasn’t ended my sickness, but the stories of when He walked on earth prove that He is our Healer. The ancient wonders remind me of the truth: my current circumstances do not outweigh God’s eternal promises.\n\nThis is the rhythm of faith.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 119:1-32\n\nWhen we lived in town, I would occasionally notice an uncanny quiet in the house, and then realize that one of my little boys had escaped. Every Thursday was trash pick up, and the siren song of the garbage truck often proves too strong for the will of toddler boys. Racing after a child who is wandering down the street—myself dressed only in my best approximation of “this will do”—is a harrowing experience. Since we’ve moved out to the country, my fellas are still entranced by all classes of trucks, but now they line up at the fence and shout their admiration from a safe distance.\n\nYou read what makes all the difference, though, right? It’s the fence. In town, all of Franklin, Tennessee, was open to us; it was just a matter of how far we wanted to walk. There was nothing to stop us. But the kids had to stay close to the house. Out in the country, while we only have two acres (my dream come true), they are allowed to enjoy every inch of those acres. The boundary of the fence gives them huge freedom. As long as they stay inside the fence, they are safe.\n\nThere is such a joyful freedom in boundaries. Psalm 119 celebrates the gift of God’s law by extolling the beauty and truth of God’s Word. In fact, that’s the primary focus of this psalm—celebrating God’s law and the boundaries it gives. And it’s given as prayer, which means this psalm is a treasure for teaching us how to pray prayers which delight in surrendering to God’s Word and will. God’s law hems in our lives so that when we are lured by garbage trucks, or whatever delights the world has to offer, we can see exactly how we are to respond. There is such safety in knowing where the lines are, instead of huddling close to the house, unsure of how far we can go. \n\nThroughout this psalm, we encounter a series of refrains—“teach me your decrees,” “I love your law,” “I will not forget your law”—which spill out like shouts of joy. The psalmist is so captivated by the goodness of God’s law, that he cannot help but declare it. He sings of God’s law as if were the very air he breathed. God’s law is the law of love, the law of liberty, the law of life. May we find our delight in his degrees! May it frame our every thought, our every breath. \n\nR.C. Sproul calls the law the “school of righteousness.” Within this school, we learn what pleases God and what offends Him. What a severe joy and a mercy it is to have God’s law, to know where to set our sights, where our boundaries lie, and enjoy the wide freedom within His gates.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 27:1-14\n\nPerhaps you’ve heard it said that in a storm, any harbor will do. When the tidal waves of life threaten to capsize our little ships, we will look anywhere for respite, often seeking shelter in places that cannot ultimately protect us. Age has alerted me to an alarming truth: the waters of life are almost always choppy. Smooth-sailing days are rare in a world as broken as ours.\n\nHere in Psalm 27, we see David sending out the distress signal. He is looking for a lighthouse to point him toward shore. He starts with a pep talk, saying, “The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?” (v. 1). But the answer to his question must have made his knees wobble. I can imagine him now, penning words of praise with one hand, while anxiously chewing his fingernails on the other.\n\nThrough the storm of his own anxiety, he saw an army positioned to take him out. In David’s case, this army may have been literal, but we all know how it feels to be surrounded, hard pressed on every side (2 Corinthians 4:8). We see serious threats against our hearts and homes every day. But we can’t fight our fears by convincing ourselves there’s nothing to be afraid of. There is! The list of rational fears is so significant, there’s not a bucket of sand big enough for us to bury our heads and fully hide from the threat.\n\nRecently, in my own life, physical, relational, and emotional forces collided to create the perfect storm. Many of my worst fears were realized, and my anxiety that there was more to come left me frantically searching for safe harbor. As all other life rafts sunk around me, I finally clung to God’s Word. As His truth anchored me, I found myself locking eyes with the disciples when they faced the storm.\n\n“And they woke him and said to him, ‘Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?’ And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, ‘Peace! Be still!’ And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. He said to them, ‘Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?’ And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, ‘Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?’” (Mark 4:38-41 ESV, emphasis mine).\n\nAny hope that we can calm the storms of life on our own is misplaced. We cannot. But we will find ourselves buoyed when we look for the One no storm can stand against. Ultimately, the disciples clung to the same truths that David did—the same truths that you and I can cling to:\n\nGod is faithful.\n\nHis care is relentless.\n\nHis promises are true.\n\nHis presence is the only place where our fears truly subside.\n\nOur hope is not that the day of trouble will not come, because it will. But our God will see us through. No calamity can untether us from God and His Word. Never. When anxiety twists our stomach in knots, when we look around and see an army of threats, not just any harbor will do. But this one will:\n\nThe Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; he knows those who take refuge in him (Nahum 1:7).\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_title": "A Prayer in Times of Sorrow",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 86:1-17\n\nThere was a season of my life when it seemed like weeping willows were suddenly sprouting on every corner. At the time, I had just taken up a new habit of running and can remember having to duck my head and step carefully on the trails so as to not tangle my feet on their branches. An artist like DaVinci or Monet probably would have been inspired by their presence. Unfortunately, I’m not the kind of girl who thinks poetically about things like pollen. I’m more prone to believe the trees are just standing in my way.\n\nThat’s exactly how I feel about sorrow—it had better stay in its own lane. I wish my experience with sorrow was only as extensive as a good cry at the end of a sad movie. But the truth is my shoulders have been crushed by the weight of grief, leaving me to feel like a weeping willow: arms fallen, exasperated, feeble. I’ve tried not to give myself over to the weight of my sadness for fear I won’t be able to stand back up again.\n\nIt’s easy to see why we call them “weeping” willow trees. They were first given their name because of the way rain falls from their branches resembling tear drops. However, they grow best near water, able to absorb large quantities of water during floods. In fact, when strategically planted beside ponds, they can even help to prevent ground erosion. And in a way, our sorrow is like that too. Avoiding it may appear to be the best survival tactic, but taking it in and then bringing it honestly before God is one way He strengthens and grows us.\n\nProtect my life, for I am faithful (Psalm 86:2).\n\nI used to think weeping willows looked like crippling sorrow, the kind you never fully recover from. They seemed to be consistently sad, their branches swaying on the ground in the wind. Yet, now I wonder if the posture of a weeping willow tree isn’t so much a picture of what sorrow does to us, as it is an image of what we’re to do with our sorrow. Heads bowed in submission to the Lord, we can expose the depth of our sadness to Him without hesitation.\n\nAll the nations you have made will come and bow down before you, Lord, and will honor your name (v. 9).\n\nDespite their appearance, weeping willows are one of the fastest growing trees around, gaining 8 to 10 feet per year. This rapid growth may be one of the reasons they have a relatively short life span. But to me, somehow this signifies the promised end of our sorrow. While the layers of sadness that fill us here on earth are many, joy is our eternal posture.\n\nLord, give strength to your servant (v. 16).\n\nSorrow stretches us in ways we probably wouldn’t ever choose for ourselves, but it strengthens us all the same. Deep sorrow makes way for great joy. By His grace, may we embrace the sorrow that seems to stand in our way, allowing it to remind us of God’s kindness, of how He strengthens, comforts, protects, and renews us. In this way, our hope and joy are not far off and distant, but present with us each and every day, just as He is. Amen.\n\nBring joy to your servant’s life, because I appeal to you, Lord (v. 4).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "A Prayer for Mercy",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 6:1-10\n\nWhen I was a high school senior, I audited an upper-level English literature course at a local college. The professor assigned two novels, both of which were written in 18th-century English, and extremely hard for this 18-year-old to decipher. Luckily, the professor explained each reading at length, and though much of that course has disappeared from my memory, I’ll never forget a quote from George Eliot’s Middlemarch. For some reason, it implanted itself in my mind, and I doubt it will ever leave. It reads:\n\n“If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence.” \n\nWhat I take from that quote is this: If we could hear “all ordinary human life” it would be deafening. Can you imagine hearing everything? From the simple growth of the grass all around us, to the cries of children in the night from hunger, to the millions upon millions of groans that go up to the Lord each moment? I cannot fathom the sound.\n\nThat’s why, when it comes to Psalm 6, I know I’m on holy ground. \n\nI don’t know for certain what left David so shaken that he wore himself out with groaning—although, there are plenty of scenarios to choose from in 1 and 2 Samuel. His best friend’s father was trying to kill him. He had to hide away in enemy territory for decades. The only men who went with him were desperate, indebted criminals (1 Samuel 22:2). In many ways, he was alone in the world.\n\nI don’t know exactly why David wrote this psalm, and I don’t know how you’ll relate to it, either. Perhaps the imagery of crying nightly against your pillow is no imagery at all. Perhaps that’s your reality. Marriages falter under the weight of years of sorrow. Children defy our expectations and hopes. Relationships plunder our hearts, leaving us to clean up the wreckage. Even the best, most hopeful times of our lives, leave us wondering what lurks around the next corner. \n\nIf your eyes are open, if your heart is beating, you know that life is full of perpetual ache. Like George Eliot said, if we could hear it all, “we should die of that roar.” But here is the beautiful thing about our God: He hears every single prayer. He catches our tears in His bottle (Psalm 56:8). And though we are unable to bear the weight of that much sorrow, He can. And He has (Isaiah 53:3-4).\n\nAfter reading the seven preceding verses about grief, I love the final three in this psalm, how the idea of hope emerges from them. I can imagine David writing them, taking a deep, post-cry breath—you know the kind. Maybe it’s still shaky. But it fills your lungs with oxygen and enables you to sit up straight and wipe the tears from your eyes. David rises to face his fears, not because his circumstances have changed, but because he is confident that the Lord has heard his weeping, and accepts his prayer (Psalm 6:9).\n\nWhatever tears you are shedding today, rest in confidence that the Lord hears you clearly. He knows you, accepts you in Christ, wants to commune with you, and longs to be gracious to you, even in the darkest hours (Isaiah 30:18).\n\nClaire Gibson is a writer whose work has been featured in publications including The Washington Post and Entrepreneur Magazine among many others.

At the time, I was fully aware that most people would take one look at my life and suggest that I had everything I needed, but somehow it didn’t feel like enough. It wasn’t that I was ungrateful for what I had, I just wanted—longed for—something more, something else. \n\nI will never forget that morning when I woke up, looked around my bedroom and burst into tears. I was married to a wonderful man. I was the mom of four healthy, happy daughters. I had friends and family that loved me, and although our lifestyle was not lavish with shopping sprees and shiny things, we were able to live on a single income—just one of the many answered prayers that had filled that season of my life. And in that moment, right outside my closed bedroom door, I could hear my husband of six years, giggling and enjoying an easy morning with our girls—more answered prayers.\n\nSo why was I crying? I felt empty and alone, and I felt guilty about both. Although my tears were streaming from a place of discontent, they were also layered with the guilt from the reality of those feelings. I was ashamed to acknowledge that answered prayers had landed me in one of the most uncomfortable seasons of my life. It seemed as if all I had prayed for was still not enough to fill me up and grant me what I thought it might deliver. It was in this very moment that God reminded me of what I was desperately seeking. It was a void His presence alone could fill. \n\nI wasn’t looking, but He found me. I wasn’t asking, but He gave me more in a moment than I would have ever asked. I was reminded of these words:\n\nThe Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing (Psalm 23:1).\n\nAs simple as they are, these words penetrated my soul and began to take up new real estate in my heart. God had answered many of my prayers, yet I’d failed to realize that His promises do not always arrive on smooth paths. But regardless of circumstances, He does promise to provide His comfort the way a good shepherd does—with a little pulling, prodding, and nudging in the direction He knows is best. The shepherd’s presence is everything to his sheep. \n\nIn the same way, in God’s presence, we need nothing more, nothing but Him. He provides and protects, and His love fills us up to overflowing. When we look to anyone or anything else but Him, we will always be left unsatisfied and wanting. Our Good Shepherd knows exactly what we need—when to get up and when to lie down and rest. He calls us to turn our focus toward Him, to be reminded that His presence is enough. He alone supplies all the guidance, provision, and comfort we will ever need.\n\nWynter Pitts is the founder of For Girls Like You, a resource ministry for both tween girls and their parents.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 51:1-19\n\nSelf-awareness. It’s a funny thing—you either have it or you don’t. And if you don’t, it usually takes a pretty embarrassing situation to make you aware that you are not self-aware. \n\nFor instance, have you ever been in a crowded room, talking to a group of friends, telling a fantastic story, having the time of your life, when you realize everyone in the room has quieted down because your enthusiastic voice has filled the entire space, distracting everyone from their own personal conversations and— \n\nNo? Just me? Cool. \n\nMy point is this: Self-awareness can be hard to come by. And when it “comes by,” it can be… uncomfortable. \n\nDavid wrote Psalm 51 after being hurled into self-awareness by the prophet Nathan. David had just slept with Bathsheba, gotten her pregnant, and ultimately, had Bathsheba’s husband killed to cover up what he’d done. And somehow, it wasn’t until Nathan confronted him that David was brought to his knees over his sin. Boom. Crippling self-awareness. This is the context for David writing in verse 3, “For I recognize my rebellion; it haunts me day and night.” \n\nAwareness of our sin in the presence of a holy God can be an unbearable weight. How could we ever measure up? It’s impossible!\n\nThat’s why I’m glad David isn’t only writing out of an awareness of himself and his own brokenness. His self-awareness is accompanied by an acute “God-awareness.” He knows the God he’s approaching. He comes before God as a man in the wrong, but with an expectation that this holy God, who eternally exists in unapproachable light and holiness, also removes sin, erases blame, and restores joy to those who love Him. He is a God who unwaveringly desires to have David in good standing with Him.\n\nI don’t know about you, but being confronted with the awareness of my own sin can be an oppressively cruel experience. Not only am I made aware of how far away I am from the holiness of God (and that distance is light years!), I often compound that feeling by hurling insults at myself, heaping on guilt and shame. I stand before myself as judge, jury, and accuser, certain that God could never accept me or approve of me because I’m just not good enough. And I wouldn’t be wrong. I’m not good enough. I never will be. I could never meet up to the standards of the holiness of God on my own. \n\nBut here’s the good news: God knows that. And He’s made a way for those who love Him to have access to Him in order to receive His forgiveness, which He freely extends through Christ. This is the God we serve. \n\nSo when I come before God, humbly aware of my sin, I don’t have to abuse myself, bowing beneath the weight of self-hatred and defeat. I can approach Him boldly and with confidence because, just like David, I have a “God-awareness.” I know the God I come before, and He silences the accusations, dismisses the guilt, and loves me out of my shame. Not only that, but every time I approach Him in humility and expectation, He makes me more like Him.\n\nErin Rose lives and works in vibrant Richmond, Virginia, where she serves as Worship & Teaching Pastor at East End Fellowship.  She is a graduate of the University of Virginia, and is currently enrolled as a graduate student at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.  Erin is a member of Urban Doxology, a ministry that is writing the soundtrack of reconciliation for the church.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 55:1-23\n\nI locked myself in the closet and tried to pray despite my bleary eyes and knocking knees. I simply couldn’t face the day. It was too hard, too painful. There was no resolve to muster, no bootstraps big enough to pull myself up by. When I read Psalm 55, I wonder if, perhaps, the psalmist penned it from a similar place.\n\nThis is one of the things I love most about the Word of God. It is not sanitized, polished up to a high shine, and put on display. The Bible does not stick to feel-good mantras or platitudes that make us all smile and nod. There is grit between the pages because, let’s face it, there is grit in all our lives. \n\nThe psalmist opens this passage begging to be heard. There’s no swagger oozing from the tip of his pen. No pretty, religious language found in these verses. He is desperate. His need to hear from the Lord is visceral. \n\n“Listen to me!”\n\n“Don’t tune me out.”\n\n“Do You hear me?”\n\n“ANSWER ME!”\n\nHis gut-level honesty makes me want to stand up and cheer. \n\nBecause there are days I can’t start my prayers neat and tidy. There are moments when my need is so great, and my heart is so tied up in knots, I can’t get much past the lump in my throat. There are times when, if I’m not sure He’s listening, I don’t know how to find the strength to go on. If I could see myself in these moments, I imagine I might look something like Hannah, crying out to God, so wrought with despair that I look drunk or crazy (1 Samuel 1:9-18). \n\nBut God heard the cry of Hannah. He heard the psalmist’s plea. And when we are restless, in anguish, afraid and trembling and horrified, or fighting the urge to take flight (Psalm 55:2,4-6), He hears us too. It seems desperation is a prayer language of its own.\n\nIt was a medical crisis that sent me to the closet that day. It was betrayal by a dear friend that sent the psalmist reeling here, to writing this psalm. Whether it’s the horror of what you see on the news, or the pain of a personal crisis, cry out! The Lord is listening. He doesn’t need us to get the words right, or ask us to wait until we calm down to come before the throne. We can bring Him our snotty noses and ugly cries. He alone can transform them into peace and joy. \n\nIt was in the closet of desperation that I learned this: God is my provider, supernaturally changing my circumstances. And He is also my sustainer, supernaturally carrying me through those circumstances. Both are grace. Perhaps that’s why the psalmist made this declaration, even before his circumstances had shifted: \n\n“Cast your burden on the LORD, and He will sustain you” (v.22). \n\nWhen we hurl our burdens at Christ’s throne, without attempting to wrap them up in pretty bows, we find He is more than able to carry them. Today, whatever our circumstances, whatever is happening in the world around us, we can bring our desperation as an offering of faith, trusting He will get us through. His will, His love, and His justice will prevail.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 143:1-12\n\nA few years ago my husband and I were in the middle of an agonizing time of decision-making. He was unemployed, we had a mortgage to pay, we were in the midst of a difficult season where we felt alone as a brand new married couple in a new city, new church, and new job for me. On top of all that, there were some peripheral difficulties clouding our judgment. It was one of those times in life where I felt completely alone and as though any decision we might make would have catastrophic results. Our circumstances weren’t even at their worst yet, but even at that point, we felt paralyzed in the midst of indecision. No direction seemed right or good or sufficient or joyful or enough for anyone else, let alone us. \n\nIt was in the midst of this indecision that one of us read these words from pastor and author Scotty Smith: \n\nGrant us peace as we make important decisions. Some of us are facing career changes, church choices, economic challenges, and health issues. Free us from the foolish notion that there is only one right choice to make. Actually, there is only one right God to trust, and that is you. Lead us, as we lean on you, Father.\n\nThis quote nudged something in us both, and it is the same nudging I feel when I read Psalm 143:8:\n\nLet me hear in the morning of your steadfast love,\n\nfor in you I trust.\n\nMake me know the way I should go,\n\nfor to you I lift up my soul.\n\nSo often we are duped into believing there is only one right decision in front of us. When the way seems cloudy, as it often does, we can find ourselves paralyzed with the fear that we’ll make the wrong decision. But this psalm of David shows us the way. It is a compass for directional purposes: Let me hear your steadfast love. In you I trust. To you I lift up my soul. \n\nWhere do I look when I don’t know where to look? To Him. To His love, His trustworthiness, His help. It is the only place my soul will find rest, the only trustworthy place, and the only love that will not let me go. \n\nWhat decisions are you facing today? What needs to be done or said or moved or broken or taken up? What opinions or thoughts or fears or refrains are you replaying over and over again in your mind? What closed doors or open doors do you see? Now, lift up your eyes, lift up your soul, and see your Maker, your God, your friend, your Savior. If He is your truest north, and serving Him, being loved by Him, and obeying Him is your greatest good, then take a step. Then another. And another. We may never know the direction life is taking us, but we can know the God who keeps us and guides us on the way He is leading us.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 142:1-7\n\nWe are not a people fond of showcasing our flaws and failures. So much of our society is meant to elevate our best selves. But no matter how long we drink from the fountain of “you have what it takes” ideology, our frailty remains a bitter pill that cannot be swallowed. \n\nThen we open our Bibles and see an entirely different approach. Prayer is not the place for pep talks or public relations. Unlike social media posts, the purpose of prayer is not to put ourselves in the best light and convince God we are good so that He will respond. Rather, prayer is the place where we admit we are weak and needy, an invitation to confess we are utterly lost in the face of trouble without the sovereign hand of God. \n\nDavid didn’t write Psalm 142 from his palace, surrounded by adoring fans. This isn’t a psalm penned after a military victory or personal triumph. This psalm is a prayer, written from a cave, a crude place of refuge, by a man on the run. \n\nIt’s not clear if these words were penned from the cave of Adullam or En-gedi, two places we find David hiding as he fled from the paranoia of King Saul (1 Samuel 22, 1 Samuel 24). In both circumstances his leader and mentor had vowed to kill him and had the resources and resolve to carry it out. David was a sitting duck who knew he could not defend himself. His enemies were armed and dangerous and David had nothing but desperation. Remarkably, he didn’t try to spin the story. When trouble surrounded him and pressed his back up against the cave wall, David declared his frailty to the Lord: \n\nListen to my cry,\n\nfor I am very weak.\n\nRescue me from those who pursue me,\n\nfor they are too strong for me.\n\n—Psalm 142:6\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons why God described David as “a man after my heart” was David’s willingness to own up to his desperation for God’s help (Acts 13:22). I read through God’s Word and cannot help but see a pattern: God is near in our trouble. \n\nWhen faced with a battle he was too weak to win, Jehoshaphat declared, “We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you” and God secured the victory (2 Chronicles 20:12). \n\nDaniel was powerless to shut the lions’ mouths, so he “implored God” to do it for him. God did (Daniel 6:11). \n\nPaul begged the Lord to take away his weakness. In response the Spirit reminded him, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9).  \n\nWeakness is power because in our weakness, we are made strong by God. In the age of spin, I need to be reminded that even weak faith is productive, even feeble prayers are answered (Matthew 17:20). Prayer is an invitation to come as we really are and hear from the God who loves us anyway. \n\nWe each have our own enemies to face and battles we cannot win. Sure, we could try to puff ourselves up with false bravado, but the illusion of our strength is easily exposed. There is an alternative to sinking into despair and defeat. When this world brings trouble to our doorstep, we can look to the Lord for comfort and wait with open hands to receive His strength.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_title": "A Prayer of Adoration",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 146:1-10\n\nEverything I need to know about earthly adoration, I learned from my middle school musical theater class. First, we learned through experience. What else is a brace-faced preteen supposed to feel upon receiving a standing ovation for her impeccably off-key version of Oliver! The Musical’s “Food Glorious Food”? For all I knew, applause and attention meant the same thing as adoration.\n\nThen, we learned from the music. One of the delightfully cheesy and romantic tunes that stands out the most is Aretha Franklin’s “I Say A Little Prayer,” which is also included on the soundtrack for the film My Best Friend’s Wedding, starring a young Julia Roberts. Perhaps you remember the chorus:\n\nForever, forever, you’ll stay in my heart\n\nAnd I will love you\n\nForever and ever, we never will part\n\nOh, how I’ll love you\n\nTogether, together, that’s how it must be\n\nTo live without you\n\nWould only be a heartbreak for me.\n\nThese were lyrics that made even prepubescent girls swoon. During rehearsals, we’d stand squished on the risers, divided into altos and sopranos, as our choral director clapped the rhythms and contorted his face into exaggerated expressions, commanding us to annunciate! “FOR-EV-ER, FOR-EV-ER,” he would chant.\n\nIt’s no coincidence that this is what we long for. We want the affection we receive to be sure, and the praise we give to remain warranted—not just one-time applause. Commitment and adoration go hand in hand, and with God, we get both.\n\nHere is where the romantic comedy cliches and the middle school dramatics stop. Adoration is not intended to be a general concept that God calls for early on and then forgets about. Rather, adoration is something we see carried throughout the psalms as a rhythmic refrain to God’s presence and nearness to us. Psalm 146 recalls reasons for adoring God: He frees prisoners, opens the eyes of the blind, raises up the oppressed, loves the righteous, and protects resident aliens. \n\nAdoration is the response we give to our God who is good and faithful in all things. It is the deep abiding love that only comes from the safety of a covenant made by a promise-keeping God who loves His children. It is His reason for choosing us, and our reason for returning to Him. He wants to adore us as His own for eternity, and because of that, we get to return and enjoy His love forever.\n\nGod remains faithful forever. (FOR-EV-ER!) His kingdom and promises and love for us will stand firm into eternity. May we learn to love and adore Him in return.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 84:1-12\n\nI learned how to drive on the interstate that we took to get to church every Sunday. My parents forced me to drive on that busy road because they knew I would have to drive it many, many times over the next few years while I lived in Birmingham. My family was in that building every time the doors were open. Sunday school, Sunday morning worship, Sunday evening worship, Wednesday evening Bible class—you name it, we were there sitting on the front row. \n\nWhile I was growing up, church always felt a little bit like something I had to check off a to-do list. I never spent the night at friends’ houses on Saturday night because I had to go to church in the morning. I would always rush home from sports practices on Wednesdays so I could make it to youth group on time. I loved church, yes, but it never felt like the kind of church the psalmist is describing in Psalm 84.\n\nWhen I was in college, I spent a semester in Santiago, Chile, and for three months, I didn’t go to church, not really. I didn’t speak much Spanish at the time, and so when I did attend church there, I spent more time and energy trying to translate the sermon in my head than just worshiping. While I was in Chile, church began to take on a completely different meaning than it did when I was a child.\n\nOver the course of a few months, the idea of “church” shifted to “Church.” The distinction of the capital “C” allowed me to view the Church as a larger being, as something other than just the place I went to worship. The Church is so much more than the small box in which I’d stowed my idea of our local church. It is family, community, a safe place to worship and experience the presence of our God.\n\nEven a sparrow finds a home,\n\nand a swallow, a nest for herself\n\nwhere she places her young—\n\nnear your altars, LORD of Armies,\n\nmy King and my God.\n\nHow happy are those who reside in your house,\n\nwho praise you continually.    Selah.\n\n—Psalm 84:3-4\n\n Let us use Psalm 84 as a means of pleading with God for what we want His Kingdom to look like here, now. May we be a people and a Church that reside in the house of our Lord, a people who praise Him continually. May we allow the Church to be a safe place for outsiders, a home for those who are lost, and a family for the broken. And may we pray for the Church be a place that bridges the gap between heaven and earth, where we meet with our God and enjoy His presence together, as a community.\n\nEllen Taylor was born and raised in sweet home Alabama, but has called Nashville home since 2013.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 2:1-12\n\nI like to be the first one awake at my house. However, I don’t like to set an alarm clock because of my dedication to the mysterious idea of sleep cycles. So instead, I play a pillow-cushioned game of Russian roulette every morning. When my body needs more sleep, I let the old girl sleep. But sometimes it all works out so that I have this gorgeous window of time—typing, planning, organizing—setting the stage for the day ahead before anyone else is awake.\n\nOne morning I was up at 5 a.m., feeling strong. I filled my arms full of things I wanted to carry into the kitchen: cups from last night, my phone, a clipboard, my little portable speaker, and a few rolls of washi tape ringed around my thumb. Juggling all of this in the dark, I preemptively nudged my phone to start playing some quiet piano music, because it usually takes a while to load. \n\nBut here are a couple things I didn’t know: First, my phone was already linked to the portable speaker. And second, everything was set at full volume. (Oh, and one thing you didn’t know: there were nine other people, too, sleeping nearby.) So in the pre-dawn light, on my way to some quiet, productive time in the kitchen, I found myself in the middle of the house, my arms uncomfortably full, clutching a speaker that was inexplicably bellowing the climax from Handel’s Messiah: “WOR-THY IS THE LAMB, THAT WAS SLAIN!”\n\nI circled around like a toy car, fumbling to turn the music off in the dark, and somehow succeeded in making the volume louder still—probably because my eyes were mostly squinted shut from laughing. And since you can’t shush a speaker, it took me a while to get quiet again.\n\nI think we sometimes want to keep Jesus in a little quiet box too. The title of today’s reading is “A Prayer Celebrating the Gift of Jesus,” and honestly, I’d expected to be writing about a sweet Christmas baby Jesus as our joy to the world. But this psalm is about the almighty dominion of Christ. He did come as a baby, yes, but He is also the omnipotent King of kings.\n\nThe psalmist calls us to “serve the Lord with reverential awe, and rejoice with trembling” (Psalm 2:11). He is a God we cannot control and cannot fully comprehend. Our proper response is to worship Him. It’s easier to think of Jesus as our pocket-sized best friend, but we need to remember that He rules and reigns the cosmos. He is a paradox, making His love for us all the more potent. We must pay Him homage, for He is our King, and all who take refuge in Him are happy.\n\nThis paradox is a beautiful and central tenet of our faith: “kiss the Son, lest He be angry” (v.12). Our God comes low to love mankind, but He remains just and unchanging, righteous and holy. We are sloppy and funny and sneaky. His love for His wishy-washy creation is so wonderful, but it doesn’t change who He is; who He has always been—the King of all creation. So we worship at the feet of this mystery we cannot control. And we celebrate the gift of Jesus, both as a baby and as King.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\n“Am I the only one in this house who knows how to load the dishwasher?!” I bark my question loudly to everyone within earshot and no one in particular. Instead of listening for an answer, I groan and scrub another bowl with cereal flakes glued to the inside. I’m annoyed, and I need them to know it. But underneath my irritated sighs, there is another feeling—a fleeting but familiar twinge of disappointment in my heart’s bent toward temporary things.\n\nThis was the scene at my home last night. And banal as it is, it’s the one that comes to mind when I think of the word that echoes throughout the book of Ecclesiastes: futility. Looking for lasting meaning apart from God is futile—as futile as trying to keep the kitchen sink empty in a house filled with snack-obsessed kids and coffee-dependent adults. “‘Absolute futility,’ says the Teacher. ‘Absolute futility. Everything is futile’” (Ecclesiastes 1:2).\n\nIt feels silly to compare King Solmon’s words to my kitchen drama, and even to admit the drama to begin with. I’m a grown woman, for crying out loud! Do I really expect an empty sink to fill me up? The honest answer is, yes, I sometimes do. In the same way that I tie some bit of my self-worth to the cleanliness of my countertop, I try to craft meaning in a thousand other things: the work I do, the clothes I wear, the photos I take and captions I create, the behavior of my children, the affection of my husband, the size of my bank account and my waistline. It’s exhausting, really. Solomon knew it too: “All things are wearisome, more than anyone can say” (v.8).\n\nEcclesiastes is the wise king’s record of his own search for meaning in life “under the sun” (v.3)—that is, life here on earth. In it, Solomon found what we, too, find if we tug on our meaning threads hard enough: every earthly thing unravels. Nothing lasts. No man-crafted meaning can fill the human heart in a full and lasting way.\n\nAs hopeless as it sounds, this is good news because it points us to the only source of true meaning and fulfillment: Jesus Christ. In the kingdom of God, life’s meaning is not determined by a mortal king’s earthly research, but by the Eternal King’s perfect goodness, justice, and love. The world we see with our eyes is temporary and fraught with futility, but our life in Christ is everlasting and marked by mercy.\n\nEcclesiastes isn’t a light read, but it’s a worthwhile one. Like every other book of the Bible, it is the true and inspired Word of God, given to us that we might know and walk with Him. So, settle in and get out your spiritual bifocals, friends. Ask the Holy Spirit to guide you as you learn to view life through a kingdom lens. As we read, may we learn to find our heart’s home in Christ alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Ellen L. Taylor\n\nI’ve always loved school. I was never the kid who held up the thermometer to a lamp so I could stay home, and the only time I ever cried about having to go to school was when it was the last day before summer. Even in high school, when getting up at 6:30 in the morning seemed like the worst thing in the world, I was still so happy to be at school once I got there (as long as I got there with some coffee).\n\nBecause of my love for school, my family and I have often joked that being a life-long student would be my dream job. And it’s true, really, most of my current career aspirations involve school, school, and then more school. It’s even better that my subject of choice is theology; I get to learn about God every day.\n\nWhen I was in divinity school, I had a bit of a crisis of faith. I found myself asking, “What is the point of paying all this money to learn about a God who is so beyond our comprehension that we could never learn all there is to know?” The learning began to feel ominous, daunting, and scary, rather than invigorating and inviting.\n\nThe author of Ecclesiastes is asking a similar question in today’s reading. Many scholars believe that King Solomon wrote the book of Ecclesiastes, and he is known as one of the wisest men in the Bible. He has spent all of this time learning and seeking out wisdom, but for what? He writes, “I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and folly; I learned that this too is a pursuit of the wind” (Ecclesiastes 1:17). He has come to the realization that not even the greatest knowledge will satisfy his deepest desire. Nothing compares to a relationship with God.\n\nI found this out the hard way in grad school. One of the hardest things for me was that I couldn’t seem to find colleagues who talked about God like God is real. For so many, God is something to be studied, rather than someone to know. In my life as a writer and editor now, I make every effort to both study and know God, because there is always more to learn, but He already knows it all.\n\nThere is a vast difference in knowledge about God and knowledge of God. Even though I love learning more than any other earthly thing, knowledge about God can never compare to the contentment of knowing of God—having a personal relationship with the Creator of knowledge Himself.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Ellen L. Taylor\n\nI turned sixteen the summer before my junior year of high school. Along with the new excitement of being able to drive came the responsibility of having my first “real” job. I worked as a cashier at a neighborhood pharmacy and gift shop in a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, taking phone calls for prescription refills and stocking the shelves with face lotion and hand soap. But the best part of this summer job was something we lovingly referred to as “Christmas in July”—receiving all of the seasonal products for Christmas at the pharmacy, pricing them accordingly, and keeping track of inventory until they put out the Christmas items in late fall.\n\nI was constantly confused by the juxtaposition of the stifling Alabama summer heat with the Santa Claus figurines and snowflake ornaments. Even so, I loved that job. The fragile ornaments and figurines needed special care while unpacking, and even though it meant I left covered in glitter every day, I paid special attention to them, lifting them gingerly out of their boxes and placing them on the storage shelves where they would sit until they made their debut in the pharmacy. It might not have been the most important job, but I found purpose in it.\n\nKing Solomon had one of the most important jobs in the Old Testament. God called him to build the temple where God’s presence would dwell among the Israelites (1Chronicles 22:6–10). This was an incredible honor, one that God didn’t even entrust to King David, who was considered a “man after [God’s] own heart” (1Samuel 13:14).\n\nDespite all this, Ecclesiastes 2 tells us that King Solomon struggled with the purpose of work. He writes, “I hated all my work that I labored at under the sun because I must leave it to the one who comes after me. And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will take over all my work that I labored at skillfully under the sun. This too is futile” (Ecclesiastes 2:18–19). To the author of Ecclesiastes, leaving his work behind after death made it meaningless, a pursuit of the wind. But he goes on to explain that while he felt as though his work was meaningless, there is “nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work” (v.24).\n\nIn Genesis 1, after the creation of humankind, God instructed Adam and Eve to work, telling them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and every creature that crawls on the earth” (Genesis 1:28). God’s design for humanity always included work—it preceded the fall! Our work is not meaningless; we are called to it. And when we do our work for the glory of the one who worked first to create us, it has eternal meaning and significance.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Mystery of Time",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nThere’s a word in the German language, sehnsucht, that C.S. Lewis popularized in his book Surprised by Joy. Sehnsucht refers to the yearning and longing our human hearts feel for more, for an unnamed place or the fulfillment of desires that cannot be quenched in this world alone. This Romantic concept was key to Lewis’s eventual belief in Christianity. He often encountered everyday things that evoked this pang of longing, like the smell of a bonfire or the sound of ocean waves, and filled him with an insatiable desire for more that he couldn’t quite explain. It was really the truth behind Ecclesiastes 3:11 that seized him: God has put eternity in our hearts.\n\nThink about that for a moment. Even taking into account what we do know, eternity is a bit of a mystery, isn’t it? From the Old Testament to Revelation, Scripture gives us clues, like tracks in the woods, but not enough to form a complete understanding.\n\nIn Scripture, the word eternity refers to the mind-bending truth that God has no beginning and no end, but it can also be used as shorthand for our future life with God—in heaven or in the coming kingdom. We will have the life of God, eternal by its very nature.\n\nBut in the same breath, the author also says that “no one can discover the work God has done from beginning to end” (v.11). This statement has always been a little confusing for me. If God put eternity in our hearts, why does He place limitations on our discovery? I want my longing to generate endless insight about what God is up to. Instead, I’m told “no one can discover” what God has done, at least not the full scope of it. There is knowledge He has reserved for His own purposes, which “no eye has seen” and “no human heart has conceived” (1Corinthians 2:9). And so our response to Him must be one of faith.\n\nAlthough there isn’t anything particularly special about bonfire smoke or sea salt, there are things in this life that catch our attention and draw us toward heaven. For you, it may be the feel of your baby’s hair. For another, maybe the taste of raspberry jam. Whatever it is, Scripture tells us that God has built eternity into the fabric of our hearts and that all creation declares His glory.\n\nBut it is still a mystery. God gives us some knowledge, but not enough to discover His full and perfect plan. So, as Christians, we acknowledge that, even if we don’t fully understand what eternity will be like or how time works in the kingdom of God, by faith we believe that God places this longing in us so that we seek and find Him. We pay attention to this “inner knowing” and choose to trust what God has revealed. What we see is not all there is. One day, the veil will be pulled back. Eternity is coming.\n\nUntil then, we have crackling bonfires and ocean waves to remind us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jessica Lamb\n\nI was recently given a robot vacuum. I’ve wanted one for several years, and the first night we turned it on, my husband and I watched it whir around our living room in awe. Then it stopped abruptly, full of dust, dirt, and who knows what else. We emptied it and ran it again. Then again. We ran it twelve times before it finally seemed satiated. But then when we ran it the next night, it had to be emptied multiple times yet again.\n\nI initially felt defeated. Foolishly, I’d imagined that this gift would mean the permanent end of my dirty floors, instead of understanding it to be a helpful tool in the inevitable. My life is one of perpetually dirty floors, of glitter shed from preschool art projects and baby food flung surprisingly far from the dining room table. There will always be dust for the Roomba at the end of each day. While I can’t stop cleaning, I’m happier when I focus my energy on the joys of the mess-makers instead of pretending like their mess can be fully avoided.\n\nAt first glance, the hopelessness of today’s passage seems almost aggressive. Like Adam after the fall (Genesis 3), we read that “all are going to the same place” (meaning we will all die), but then the author of Ecclesiastes seemingly pivots and tells us to “enjoy [our] activities’ (Ecclesiastes 3:20–22).\n\nHe tells us to enjoy this life because we know death is a part of our post-fall reality, not just in spite of it. We can’t outrun death any easier than I can outsweep dirt in my home. But if we remember to number our days, we gain wisdom (Psalm 90:12). Against the backdrop of eternity, of knowing that our time here is limited, we can rightly hold all the good and bad of this life in proper perspective.\n\nWe can enjoy the blessings in our lives without expecting them to fill us in a way they were never meant to. We can grieve, mourn, and endure pain, because we know those, too, have an expiration date. We can learn to invest our hopes in and entrust our sorrows to an eternal God who satisfies eternally.\n\nAnd on this side of the cross, we know God does not leave us in dust. Death is not our permanent end. As believers, we will also bear the image of Jesus, the man of heaven (1Corinthians 15:49), whose defeat over the grave is the first taste of a future harvest when all believers will be resurrected (v.20). We know that after death we will find ourselves in the presence of the Lord, where there is abundant joy (2Corinthians 5:8) and resurrection victory over death (1Corinthians 15:57). The gospel transforms the meaning of life, and it transforms the meaning of death.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Ellen L. Taylor\n\nIn January of my sophomore year of college, I laced up my hiking boots and packed a backpack (and two huge suitcases) and set off for a semester abroad in Santiago, Chile. My then-boyfriend, whom I had begun dating just a mere three months prior to leaving, wrote me a letter to read while I was gone. There is one passage from the letter that I still think of occasionally. In it was Ecclesiastes 4:12: “A cord of three strands is not easily broken,” and below it, the words “and what a strong cord we will have: you, me, and the Lord of all creation.” And although that relationship didn’t survive the strain of a semester away from each other (long distance is hard when you’re nineteen!), I’ve applied that sentiment to many of my relationships over the years: friendships, romantic relationships, and familial relationships alike.\n\nWhen I was young, I didn’t know how to braid my hair. I would end up just separating my hair into two sections and twisting them around each other, until one year at church camp when a friend taught me how to correctly braid my hair. The secret? Separating it into three sections, like the author of Ecclesiastes says in chapter 4, the cord of three strands is not easily broken. I’ve found this to be true over and over again throughout my life. My relationships with other people are so much stronger when the relationship is built on a mutual desire to serve and love God first, then each other.\n\nSurrounding yourself with people who love the Lord is so important, especially during formational seasons of life. Lack of community makes it increasingly hard to find purpose. I have found that a life in pursuit of God is so much more meaningful when it is done in community. When surrounded by other believers, seasons of fruitfulness become even more sweet, and seasons of doubt are met with comfort and understanding. The cord of three strands provides a safe place to learn, to question, and to grow. It is important that we not only seek out this kind of community for ourselves, but commit to being this kind of community for those around us.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nWhat does your prayer life look like in this season of life? How, specifically, do you pray each day?\n\nAs a mom with small kids and a church to help lead, I will confess that my prayer life is often rushed. I pray throughout the day, squeezing it in when I can. I pray when I wake up, I pray when I am driving, I pray at meals, I pray when someone comes to mind, and I pray as I fall asleep. Because of this rhythm, my prayer life is often hurried. And when I do pray, I am doing the majority of the talking.\n\nThis is how many of us pray, especially in hectic seasons of life. God functions as a touchstone throughout our schedule, and there is some good in this practice. It reminds us of the ever-present help we have in Him. However, I have recently become convicted that this practice lacks something important: listening.\n\nI recently heard a podcast describe the strange training regimen of NASA astronauts preparing for space. Because outer space is absolutely silent to a degree that we never experience on earth, astronauts must learn to adjust to it. They do this by spending time in a noiseless chamber where the silence is profound. In fact, the absence of noise is so absolute that you can hear the sound of your own body and its most basic, typically imperceivable, inner workings: the sound of your own breathing, or your heart beating and pumping blood to the rest of your body, the sound of skin sliding over sinew, of bones rubbing against one another—which is about when astronauts start hearing things that aren’t actually there.\n\nThis description is almost unsettling to read, but it helps us to grasp the loud volume of our everyday lives. We live in a world where silence, true silence, is difficult to come by. But as these astronauts have discovered, it is only through silence that we can hear things we’ve never heard before.\n\nFor many of us, silence is the missing ingredient from our prayer lives. We are unable to hear from God because we haven’t created the environment for it. This is what the author of Ecclesiastes is saying: He counsels, “Do not be hasty to speak, and do not be impulsive to make a speech before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few” (Ecclesiastes 5:2). This is an invitation to turn our prayer life on its head by listening more to what God has to say, rather than solely bringing petitions and requests before Him.\n\nThis can be a challenge, but it is also a word of grace and good news to any of us who do not know what to pray, or those of us who feel pressure to pray in a certain manner. Instead, it reminds us that prayer is not simply about us speaking to God, but God speaking to us. If we will only make the space to listen.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Tragedy of Wealth",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nSeveral months ago, our oldest son earned a toy by accomplishing a series of educational milestones. He had worked hard, and we were eager to celebrate him, so we drove to the store and purchased a LEGO set as his reward. All seemed well until we were pulling out of the parking lot and I heard his little voice from the back seat: “I wish this part of the set was different.” Not five minutes after we had purchased the toy, he was already disappointed.\n\nI have watched my son experience the same disappointment again and again. The trinket he bought with his own money. The dessert he picked out. The Nerf gun he begged us to give him for Christmas. As soon as he gained possession of each promising new prize, his satisfaction evaporated into thin air.\n\nMy son and I have this conversation often. He complains when his latest present is disappointing. I explain that he cannot derive the fullness of his joy from material things. Around and around we go. It’s a struggle my son will experience for the rest of his life, and I know this because it’s a struggle I’ve had for all of mine.\n\nOn some level, we all know that money and possessions cannot satisfy us. And yet, if we are being honest, most of us seek after them anyway. Perhaps not as cravenly as the “wolves on Wall Street,” but who among us is not enticed, and then duped, by the promise and the security of having more?\n\nIn Ecclesiastes 5 and 6, the author explains the vanity of this search. He does so by describing multiple scenarios in which the accumulation of wealth amounts to nothing. One man spends his whole life growing his wealth, but is never fully satisfied by it (Ecclesiastes 5:10). Another accumulates wealth but then loses it all in a bad venture (v.13–14). Still another earns riches and honor, which are then taken by another (Ecclesiastes 6:1–2). Over and over he depicts the precarious fragility of money, and the spiritual futility of striving after it.\n\nIn these chapters the author is harsh, because he wants to communicate a counter-intuitive idea. Counter to our logic, the accumulation of wealth is not the answer to our problems. Instead, it has all the dependability of a house of cards. Wealth and possession look sturdy to the eye, but they snap like a toothpick under the weight of our souls. That is why so many wealthy people still feel insecure—because they are. Because wealth and material things are inherently fragile and empty, no matter how much we have.\n\nWhen “all of your labor is for your own stomach,” the truth is you “will never be satisfied” (Ecclesiastes 6:7). It’s a lesson that many of us will choose to learn the hard way, or never learn at all, but we cannot escape its reality: no matter how much we earn or gain or accomplish, the pursuit of wealth is like standing atop a house of cards, when we were created for the Rock of Ages.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Ellen L. Taylor\n\nI was living in Santiago with two of my closest friends for a semester abroad when I earned my college nickname: Kellen. It was one of those dear friends who coined the term, after witnessing me declare that getting ice cubes out of the ice tray was “literally the hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life.” She softly sighed and said, “Ah, Kellen.” And thus my new name was born, and it’s stuck, apparently, given that some of my friends still call me some form of Kellen, Kel, or Kellie more than five years later.\n\nWhen we returned to school in the states, others asked what had inspired my new nickname. My friend explained that it happened because, as usual, I was living a life of emotional extremes. My friends have always described me this way, that I’m either having the best day of my life or the worst—there’s not really much room for anything in between.\n\nLiving a life of extremes is exactly what the author of Ecclesiastes is cautioning against in today’s reading. Although one of the major themes throughout the book of Ecclesiastes is the pursuit of wisdom, and King Solomon (to whom many scholars attribute Ecclesiastes) asked God specifically for wisdom (1Kings 3:9–12), he still cautions the reader to not be excessive in their pursuit of it.\n\nHave you ever heard the phrase “too much of a good thing”? I’ve often heard it used in reference to a delicious meal or dessert, when the decadence of the meal has caused a person to feel stuffed to the point of being uncomfortable. This is what the author of Ecclesiastes seems to be saying in this passage; there can be too much of a good thing. One’s pursuit of righteousness and wisdom can get to the point where it is excessive and no longer helpful, in the same way that a pursuit of foolishness can also be excessive. Instead, we are instructed to not be excessively righteous or overly wise (Ecclesiastes 7:16).\n\nThe key here seems to be the need for balance. Like we read in Ecclesiastes 1, when it comes to the pursuit of knowledge, we must be content with not knowing everything. There will always be more to learn, more to discover, and more ways to be wise. Our contentment can be found not in the extremes of pursuing all knowledge or in casting all wisdom aside for foolishness, but in fearing God while we are on earth, knowing that a greater glory awaits us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nI thought I knew him. We spent our whole childhoods in the same one-stoplight town. I recognized his momma, knew what sports he played and what kind of music he listened to, but as I glance back in life’s rearview mirror it’s clear to me: I didn’t know a thing.\n\nIt’s taken twenty years of marriage to discover all I didn’t know; things like how he likes his eggs cooked, how his lips turn when he’s sad, and what keeps him awake with worry in the wee hours of the morning. Time and commitment have pressed our knowing past the surface, down into the deepest crevices of our hearts.\n\nSolomon’s quest for knowledge about God was unmatched. With his jaw set and fists clenched, it seems he resolved to be wise. He stacked one fact about God on top of the next, yet a heart of wisdom seemed just out of reach (Ecclesiastes 7:27–28).\n\nIn the end, Solomon’s quest to know about God ended in cynicism (v.29) and sin (1 Kings 11:4). In contrast, history remembers Solomon’s father King David as a man after God’s own heart (1 Samuel 13:14; Acts 13:22). While Solomon sought to understand the ways of God, David sought to know the heart of God. The difference in their lives couldn’t have been more stark.\n\nSolomon considered knowing God and bemoaned, “What exists is beyond reach and very deep. Who can discover it?” (Ecclesiastes 7:24). His father, however, marveled, “LORD, you have searched me and known me… Your works are wondrous, I know this very well ” (Psalm 139:1,14). Solomon’s wisdom, it seems, stayed on the surface, while David’s was pressed down into the deepest crevices of his heart.\n\nFor all the hours he spent searching and all the ink he spilled teaching, Solomon isn’t the poster child for wisdom. Not really. Instead, he shows us clearly that there’s a difference between knowing about God and actually experiencing Him in relationship, for Solomon’s head knowledge didn’t lead to lasting heart transformation.\n\nHow do we avoid Solomon’s mistake, accumulating facts about God like dusty books unread on the shelf? How can we guard against studying wisdom while acting like a fool? We remember this: Wisdom isn’t an item to collect but a Person to be cherished.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nOne summer, three friends and I strapped on our backpacks to hike the irrigation trail up the side of a canyon wall. This one canyon is a popular hiking spot because of its proximity to the Foresthill Bridge, the fourth highest bridge in the United States.\n\nHalfway up the mountain, nausea hit. Due to the intermingling of 90-degree heat and a limited water supply, I felt instant regret over suggesting this vertical trail that wasn’t even meant for hiking. (It’s an irrigation trail, after all.) Wisdom sure wasn’t the one leading the charge in this decision; it was my own ego and the myth of invincibility. After we almost passed out from dehydration, two of my friends had to shoulder my body weight and help carry me the rest of the way.\n\nScripture says that “a person’s wisdom brightens his face” (Ecclesiastes 8:1). At the time when Ecclesiastes was written, wisdom was attributed as coming from a divine source. A bright face was considered physical evidence of wisdom in the wise person’s life, just as Moses’s face shone with radiance after spending time with the Lord (Exodus 34:34–35).\n\nOur faces today may not emit a visible shining substance when we make good decisions or spend quality time with the Lord. But wisdom lingers with us the way campfire smoke stays on your clothes after hours roasting the perfect marshmallows. It favorably directs our steps and will be evident in our lives when we exercise it. Since our thoughts and actions affect those we are in community with, when we use wisdom in decision-making, we can also bring life to our collective environments. In doing so, perhaps our sphere of the world can better operate by kingdom values, such as justice, mercy, and love.\n\nProverbs offers the encouragement that “remembrance of the righteous is a blessing” (Proverbs 10:7). Those who live from a place of wisdom—whose faces are “brightened” by the Spirit of the Living God—are a blessing. It’s not that the wise avoid folly altogether. They just learn from their mistakes. As Jesus-followers, if our aim is to pursue abundant life, our lives will be marked by years that smell like wisdom.\n\nIn the end, climbing a mountain on a 90-degree day probably wasn’t wise. While our faces may have glistened, it wasn’t from nearing the Mount of Transfiguration, but from perspiring pearls of sweat that mocked our foolish decision. You’d better believe we learned from that mistake and will only plan future hikes up paths that are intended for human recreation.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nA day will come for all of us when we are separated from the ones we love most. This is heartbreaking. It was never meant to be this way. Death was not a part of the design specs of the garden of Eden, and this is why death affects us so deeply; our minds and hearts were not engineered to handle the effects of death. But God has wisdom for us, and through Solomon, has given counsel for navigating “the vapor” that is life under the sun (Ecclesiastes 1:2–4).\n\nKing Solomon tells us to enjoy life while we’re living it. Plain, simple, to the point. We are to look at what God has given us—the blessings we acknowledge and everything we take for granted—and maximize our joy in those gifts from Him. We are to leverage them to care for His Church, and in the process, He makes us more aware of what we’ve been given: “The righteous, the wise, and their works are in God’s hands” (Ecclesiastes 9:1). Solomon tells us to savor our meals, to tell stories and clank our glasses with friends, looking into the eyes of our fellow image-bearers. Why? Because it won’t always be like this. These moments are fleeting, so grab them now.\n\nWisdom in this life involves more than just fighting sin; wisdom also means fully living the life God has given us. Because of Jesus’s death and rising, we realize it’s not unspiritual to enjoy life—it’s actually biblical—for the glory of God and for our good. Jesus defeating death shows us that God doesn’t ignore the beauties of physical human life; He redeems them. Therefore, we ought to enjoy them and give thanks for them in the moment, which is an act of those who are fully alive, “for the living know that they will die” (Ecclesiastes 9:5).\n\nThis does not mean that we can shirk our responsibilities in pursuit of our own personal pleasure and comfort—that’s worldliness. Disciples of Christ discover joy in the ordinariness of life. Today, resolve to be present and relish in what you have been given from God, enjoying and acknowledging “every good and perfect gift” from “the Father of lights, who does not change like shifting shadows,” despite our circumstances (James 1:17).\n\nWhatever you do in this life, do it all the way. Whatever it is that you’ve been called to do for work, family, church—do it with all your strength (Ecclesiastes 9:10). Life’s too fleeting for half-measures and good intentions. Both are ultimately empty acts, and Jesus came so that each of us “may have life and have it in abundance” (John 10:10). Love and live fully, laugh until you cry, embrace those around you. Enjoy life today, remembering that it is a vapor, but that in our God’s presence are abundant joys and eternal pleasures (Psalm 16:11).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\n“What should you do when you’re in a hole, son?”\n\nThis is the question I often ask when one of my four boys responds to correction by arguing or deflecting blame. They know the routine. The question interrupts their defense mechanisms. Most of the time, their little arms drop to their sides as they sigh and answer: “Stop digging.”\n\nIt’s a word picture Scripture gives us, and one I like to imagine David used as he corrected his son, Solomon. It was King David who penned, “He dug a pit and hollowed it out but fell into the hole he had made” (Psalm 7:15). Solomon repeated his father’s wisdom when he wrote, “The one who digs a pit may fall into it, and the one who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake” (Ecclesiastes 10:8). (Don’t you like how he added that last part?)\n\nI don’t know about you, but I don’t do a lot of pit digging, let alone snake-infested wall-breaking, for that matter. Without context, I might be tempted to race right past these verses thinking they don’t apply. But as we study Scripture’s Wisdom Literature, we see that neither David nor Solomon were warning against a literal pit, the kind that is dug with an actual shovel. No, this is a pit of trouble, and the shovel, in this case, is our words.\n\nIt was Solomon who reflected, “The words from the mouth of a wise person are gracious, but the lips of a fool consume him” (Ecclesiastes 10:12), and his father David who prayed, “LORD, set up a guard for my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips” (Psalm 141:3).\n\nIf you’ve ever felt buried under the weight of your foolish words, or wished there were a superglue that could seal your mouth shut, I’m sure you can relate. We all can. When our words have dug us into a pit of trouble, God’s Word and His Spirit remind us that wise words can only flow from a wise heart. When our speech reveals our folly we have a choice. Argue, deflect, defend, or stop digging and repent, asking the Lord to give us hearts more like His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nOne day after work, I stopped by a retail store on the way home. Everyone and their mother was in line waiting for this one poor girl to ring them up at the register. I couldn’t help but notice she looked upset—haggard, irritated, all the unhappy adjectives. My first reaction was to wish she had a better spirit of customer service, but then something softened, and I was convicted to strike up a conversation once it was my turn. The short story was this: No, she wasn’t having a good day, because her best friend had just died, and she was the one who had discovered the body. To intensify her grief, she couldn’t find someone to cover her shift that coming Saturday and had to miss the funeral.\n\nAs you can imagine, few words felt appropriate in this situation. Doing nothing felt cold, but offering words of false comfort felt colder. How would Jesus respond?\n\nLong story short, the Spirit prompted me to do something tangible for this girl—not to persuade her that everything would be okay or that knowing God would suddenly lessen the pain, but because the moments when I’ve felt most loved were moments when another human being did something unexpected to show God’s kindness to me. So, I returned to the store with a chocolate cupcake and a card that said this: “I’m so sorry you lost your best friend. Nobody should ever have to go through that. God sees you and grieves with you.”\n\nThe world encourages us to spend our days like money, trading them in for pleasure and recreation. But, friends, God urges us to invest our lives in the kingdom. He promises that we will reap a harvest one day (Galatians 6:9). We can’t guarantee that one conversation or random act of kindness will be the one to change someone’s life, but we can trust that God does not waste one moment of our lives. Ecclesiastes 11:6 says it this way: “In the morning sow your seed, and at evening do not let your hand rest.”\n\nEven while operating out of a focus on life under the sun, the writer of Ecclesiastes lifts his head for a moment to comment on what life looks like in the kingdom. He acknowledges there is a God, one who has the power to make what we sow flourish, as well as bring judgment on our actions.\n\nWe never know God’s timing or how He might multiply the work of our hands. So, we sink our teeth into each day. Investing, planting, watering, we pray for the flourishing of God’s movement in the world. But even when we don’t see the fruit, God is still trustworthy with the results.\n\n“Whatever you do, do it from the heart, as something done for the Lordand not for people, knowing that you will receive the rewardof an inheritance from the Lord” (Colossians 3:23–24).\n\nInstead of spending all our days like money, let’s look for ways to invest in life. Giving someone a cupcake to remind them that their grief isn’t insignificant feels so small—almost silly. But as I watched the girl behind the register run around the counter with a big smile and arms spread open, it felt like Jesus was up to something.\n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jessica Lamb\n\nMy second child recently turned seven months old. Though I experienced these same developmental milestones with my first, something about this second time around has left me even more in awe of how quickly babies grow and change. In his first few days, my son could only hold up his head for seconds at a time. When he came home from the hospital, he could only see about fifteen inches away, just far enough to make out my face as I held him and stared at his tiny features. He can now see me clearly from across the room and crawl toward me as fast as his not-so-tiny legs can move.\n\nI sometimes wonder if that’s one of the reasons he cries on occasion, even when every need I can think of is met. Because today, his world looks totally different than it did yesterday. The whole world is open for discovery, but that growth meant a sharp change in perspective.\n\nI imagined that sort of cry at the end of our reading today. The author of Ecclesiastes has been writing at length about life “under the sun.” A life where delight fades, strong men stoop, songs grow faint, and dust returns. A life where so much is “absolute futility.” Then, in the last few verses, there are these words:\n\nBe warned: there is no end to the making of many books, and much study wearies the body.When all has been heard, the conclusion of the matter is this:fear God and keep his commands, because this is for all humanity.For God will bring every act to judgment, including every hidden thing,whether good or evil (Ecclesiastes 12:12–14).\n\nFor almost the entirety of my professional career I have worked in publishing, and I always want to voice a hearty “Amen!” at verse 12. There is no end to the making of books, to writers and philosophers and poets and politicians and artists and parishioners trying to make sense of our place as humans in this world. But the path to seeing our days differently is made clear here, because there is more to see than we once thought. For every single one of us, the key to meaning is the same: fear God, and keep His commands.\n\nThis is for all of us, because God is for all of us. He is our Creator, whose eyes saw us while we were still being formed (Psalm 139). He is our Sustainer, who knows when a single sparrow falls, clothes the flowers of the field, and anticipates our needs and worries (Matthew 6:25–34;10:29–31; 1Peter 5:7). He is our Savior, who invites us to follow Him and be part of His kingdom work here and now. His Word equips us to see our world through His perspective, and recast all our days in light of eternity.\n\nSo remember your Creator, find your confidence in the Lord. He is the resurrection, He is the life. This is for all of us, if we’ll just take hold and believe it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hosea 1:1-11, Titus 3:4-7\n\nI spent many years being a wanderer. In many ways, I still am.\n\nMy heart is easily distracted by false loves, things I imagine will bring me life when all they really do is pry my eyes from the truer life I’ve already been given.\n\nWhen David and I got married, a family friend—a man his father’s age who’d known David since he was a boy—pulled him aside a day before the ceremony. The words he spoke were not merely advice; they were a mandate, an imperative. Be faithful to your wife, he said. You aren’t immune to infidelity; don’t give yourself the opportunity.\n\nNot a year goes by where we do not remember his advice, admitting our brokenness to one another and praying God’s grace on the promise we made all those years ago.  \n\nAt heart, I am Gomer. I am a woman who sabotages love in spite of what I know to be true. I did it when I was younger, “looking for love in all the wrong places,” as the old country song puts it. And I do it now, looking for love in the praise of others, in social media likes, and even in the refrigerator late at night. I hear the call of my false loves every day. And every day, I hear the faithful call of my One True Love, the God who made me for love in the first place.\n\nHere is what the Lord said to the prophet Hosea when Israel was going her adulterous way:\n\nGo and marry a promiscuous wife\n\nand have children of promiscuity,\n\nfor the land is committing blatant acts of promiscuity\n\nby abandoning the Lord.\n\n– Hosea 1:2\n\nThe word “promiscuous” here is a heavy word. Other versions translate it as “wife of whoredom,” “wife of harlotry,” or even “prostitute.” The woman God was calling Hosea to pursue was not just double-minded; she was actively and consistently deceitful, disloyal, and devious. She was all of us.\n\nIsrael was caught in a cycle of sin, and God was ready to get her attention. Hosea was to show Israel her sin, literally, by taking an unfaithful wife and being faithful to her.\n\nGod’s judgment on His unfaithful people was more than clear. They were not fit to be His people. They were not fit to be His, period. And yet…\n\nYet the number of the Israelites\n\nwill be like the sand of the sea…\n\nAnd in the place where they were told:\n\nYou are not My people,\n\nthey will be called: Sons of the living God.\n\n– Hosea 1:9-10\n\nThe Lord, the perfect and faithful One, would have mercy, grace, and compassion on Israel, the always-unfaithful ones. God said of Israel, “I will deliver them by the Lord their God. I will not deliver them by bow, sword, or war, or by horses and cavalry” (Hosea 1:7). This would be no worldly rescue. This would be the promised salvation of God’s people by the Almighty God Himself, a promise established from the first sin of the first man and woman in the first book of the Bible (Genesis 3:15).\n\nThe consequences of sin were real and painful, but the rescue would come—not by the merit of those being rescued, but because of the merciful grace of God.\n\nAnd that, friends, is the theme of this book we begin reading today. The book of Hosea is a treatise on the unworthiness of sinners and the graciousness of God. We are wanderers, all of us. We run after false loves while the Father runs after us. But, praise the Lord, His faithfulness is greater than our sin.\n\nHe saved us—\n\nnot by works of righteousness that we had done,\n\nbut according to His mercy,\n\nthrough the washing of regeneration\n\nand renewal by the Holy Spirit.\n\n– Titus 3:5\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Hosea 2:1-13, Ezekiel 21:1-7\n\nWhen I was in college, I volunteered as a Young Life leader. That meant I spent my afternoons driving to a local high school, only to awkwardly walk through the cafeteria, trying to befriend high school girls, and eventually, tell them about Jesus. \n\nEvery summer, we took hoards of high schoolers to a camp in Colorado, where we promised they’d have the “best week of their lives.” Midnight obstacle courses, pool parties, and delicious family-style meals were all punctuated by “club,” a gathering where we’d scream songs at the top of our lungs, and then later quiet down and listen to a speaker talk about God and this man called Jesus. About three days in, the speaker stopped talking about God and started talking about sin, something he told hundreds of teenagers they were powerless to fix.\n\nThat day was never fun. And neither is today’s passage from Hosea.  \n\nHad I read these verses a few years ago, I would have written a true but shallow reflection. Something about how angry God gets at our sin, and how grateful we should be for Jesus. Back then, I knew I was an adulterer theoretically. But practically speaking, I’d done a pretty good job of following the rules. \n\nNow, here I am, reading these verses with new eyes, on the other side of a marathon of misplaced affections. Angry at God and threatening to sabotage my relationships and even my marriage, I chased down false loves I knew were off limits to me: a job that took me away from home, clothes and experiences that were out of my budget, a belief that freedom existed outside the walls of my life rather than within them. I ran hard. God wasn’t giving me what I wanted, so I pursued other gods instead.\n\nNow, here I am, reading from God’s Word, “This is what the Lord says: I am against you” (Ezekiel 21:3). Are there any more terrifying words? But when I am pursuing sin, I need the Lord to oppose me. I need the Lord to intervene.\n\nOn a Saturday in April, sitting in a grassy field in the middle of Tennessee, I held a cell phone to my ear and cried my eyes out to a dear friend who had watched me choose that futile path. “I’ve been running for so long,” I cried to her. And her response came slowly, softly. “That’s the thing about God. When you’re running, He’s in hot pursuit. And He will take you down.” \n\nLet me say this from firsthand experience: getting taken down by God doesn’t always feel good. The New Testament tells us that God’s kindness leads us to repentance (Romans 2:4). But that kindness, in the moment, may not always feel so kind. It can be mortifying. Embarrassing. Oftentimes, it is public, because our Lord is the King of bringing things from darkness into the light (Luke 1:79). \n\nHe could turn us back to Him with a soft and tender hand, and often, He does. But sometimes, His kindness comes with thornbushes, with walls in our way (Hosea 2:6). With shipwrecks and blindness and the belly of a whale. He turns us back with Calvary—the bloodiest kindness of all. \n\nThat’s what made those days in Colorado so powerful: watching teenagers learn the joy of a grace that is greater than our sin. God has once and for all redeemed our lives with the cross. We are His. And because He is holy and loving, and because we are His children, He will not tolerate our false gods or sit idly by while we run from Him. \n\nPraise God, He takes us down.\n\n\n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nText: Hosea 2:14-23, 2 Samuel 12:1-10\n\nMan, I love being on the right side of an argument. \n\nBeing “righteously right” is more satisfying to me than a dark chocolate-covered pretzel (and those are pretty darn good). Sure, I’ll forgive you—just as long as you know I’m the one administering the mercy, and you’re the one admitting your shortcoming. It’s restoration on my terms and with my limits. You’re welcome.\n\nNot super attractive. Not to my kids, not to my husband, not to the people I work with, and not to the One seated on the Mercy Seat. \n\nBut mercy isn’t about our righteousness. We don’t grant mercy because we are more and someone else is less. We grant mercy because we have been granted mercy. Period. We watch God, in His Word and in our own lives, act in mercy toward us every day. He requires us to repent but He doesn’t make us grovel. He invites us, just like He invited Israel, to return from how very wrong we are. And He makes us right because He is righteous. Because we have been shown real mercy, we can begin to learn to show the same.\n\nDo you see the way God demonstrates mercy to His people in today’s reading? Israel is wronger than wrong—deeply unfaithful and offensive—and God makes plans to allure His unfaithful bride with tenderness. And my favorite: He promises to make the Valley of Achor (also known as the “Valley of Trouble,” a place synonymous with sin and death) into “a gateway of hope” (Hosea 2:15). Not even a gate—a gateway!\n\nGod makes it easy for us to come home too. He laid out the welcome mat for unfaithful Israel in spite of their wandering and unwillingness to return His faithfulness. God’s unrelenting love was just that—it never stopped inviting. And it never stops inviting and pursuing us. Not only does God’s faithful love save us, it also teaches us. It shows us how to show mercy—how to be unrelenting in our tenderness, offering gateways of hope because the same has been done for us. \n\nAs we read the book of Hosea, we learn no one is beyond the reach of God’s forgiveness. No one is too wrong to receive mercy. God may bring judgment and consequence for our sins, but His ultimate aim is restoration, as demonstrated even in the way He renamed Hosea’s children. \n\nHe calls us His people too. He calls you His person. His Word teaches us—from Eden’s fig leaves, to Hosea’s family, to the very line of David—that God is in the eternal business of turning condemnation into restoration. This restoration is for us to receive, and for us to offer to others. Being righteously right won’t get us anywhere, but joining the Father in His business of restoration is work worth doing well. Receive His invitation today, friend. Receive His mercy. \n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Hosea 3:1-5, Romans 5:6-8, Exodus 20:1-3\n\nIt started the way these things always do. I ate a cookie and wanted another one. \n\nBut here’s the catch: Although it tasted like gooey, chocolatey goodness, it was technically considered a protein bar, something you’d proudly toss in your workout bag. But delicious and permissible? These things do not just happen. I felt like I’d unlocked THE secret to eternal snacking bliss. \n\nGomer’s story starts the same way. She was hungry for love, and she had it in her husband, Hosea. But she wanted more. Her desire was delicious and permissible—until it wasn’t. And Hosea was left with something far from what he’d hoped for, not unlike the cardboard box that had arrived at my door a few weeks later. \n\nThat box was unexpectedly heavy, underscoring the compromises I’d made on flavor and price in exchange for a pantry filled with a lifetime supply of healthy “cookies.” As I opened the box, red and green labels signaled that my online order of “seasonal” and “limited edition” delights actually meant Christmas (it was May) and crusty (with mold, you guys). So here I am, stuck with a pantry full of rotten, non-returnable snacks. Incidentally, can I interest anyone in a “Snickerdoodle”? \n\nAlthough I’m unsure about their stance on snickerdoodles, we know the Israelites loved raisin cakes. They piled them high and gorged themselves full in observance of the law and idol-worship. We see an illustration of their rebellion through Gomer; their pursuits of dried fruits and her chase after pitted romance would not lead to the one True Vine. \n\nAs a result, Hosea and Gomer’s marriage exited the honeymoon phase quickly—but they aren’t the only ones. Before we point fingers or assign blame, we ought to remember this truth: God is in a terrible marriage, too—with us—one He should have divorced from long ago.\n\nHe loved us first.\n\nWe loved sin more.\n\nHe made us without shame.\n\nWe dirtied the white dress.\n\nHe gave us a covenant.\n\nWe didn’t show up to the altar.\n\nYou cannot know how many healthy cookie bars are stuffed in each of my kitchen cabinets, a daily reminder of my unexpected, unwanted purchase. I can’t help but wonder: Was Hosea filled with the same regret? Is God? \n\nHosea is fully aware of Gomer’s adultery, yet God tells him to pursue her still.\n\n“Go again; show love to a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, just as the Lord loves the Israelites though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes” (Hosea 3:1).\n\nHosea doesn’t have enough money to buy her back, so he pays for her with 15 shekels and 5 bushels—the price of a slave (Exodus 21:32). \n\nGod is all-knowing of our unfaithfulness, yet He pursues us still. He gives everything He has to buy us back, paying for us with His Son and a cross—the price for the ungodly (Romans 5:6).\n\nWe are His runaway brides, but He will not divorce us. May we return to Him with awe. Amen. \n\n“Then God spoke all these words: I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery. Do not have other gods besides Me.”\n\n– Exodus 20:1-3\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Hosea 4:1-19, Proverbs 19:2, 2 Corinthians 4:3-6\n\nI was raised in the church, which means I speak “Christian” rather fluently.\n\nTerms like “quiet time” and “sinner’s prayer,” or cautionary calls to “guard your heart” and “pray for a hedge of protection”—I know all the buzz words. When I went to seminary, I learned even bigger words like “sanctification” and “justification.” Between my background and my education, you could say I know a lot about the Bible. \n\nHowever, I need to confess something about all that “knowledge.” Sometimes, I coast on it. Sometimes, I rely on my familiarity with Scripture, instead of actually opening up God’s Word. Sometimes, I assume what Jesus’ response would be, instead of looking it up for myself. Sometimes, I quote verses that fit the situation, instead of exploring Scripture for a fresh perspective. And sometimes, I substitute vague, scattered prayers for intentional time in God’s Word.\n\nI can go weeks without actually reading the Bible, and no one will ever know. I can mask my neglected faith as a flourishing one, simply because I know the right answers. \n\nBut I can’t do it for long because I am a human being, and human beings forget. We forget God’s faithfulness and we forget His truths, which means we must return to His Word daily. Like water, like food, we must consume Scripture day after day, because our broken minds will struggle to recall it. No matter how familiar we are with God’s Word, we will forget it.\n\nThis is exactly what happened to the Israelites in Hosea. Israel was a people whose history was intertwined with God. His Word and His truth were written into their very identity. And yet, God had this against them:\n\n“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge” (Hosea 4:6).\n\nAccording to Old Testament scholar David Allan Hubbard, this “knowledge” refers specifically to the knowledge of God, a knowledge the Israelite priests had failed to pass on. The people of Israel had, collectively, forgotten who they were. They had forgotten whose they were. And throughout chapter 4, we see the terrible consequences of their forgetting. \n\nWhen you know a lot about God, it’s tempting to take that knowledge for granted. It’s easy to treat your soul like a hard drive, as if you can download the data and click “save.” But our hearts and our minds are more like leaky buckets. Given enough time away from the source, all the water eventually drains out. \n\nProverbs 19:2 tells us, “Desire without knowledge is not good, and whoever makes haste with his feet misses his way.” This verse discourages us from rushing to judgment, or letting our emotions carry us away, but it also has something larger in view. This verse is about the entirety of the Christian life. No matter your upbringing, no matter your desire to serve God, your soul requires daily doses of the knowledge of God. Without it, your heart will slowly wander astray. \n\nIn that sense, the story of the Israelites is a cautionary tale. The Israelites weren’t any different from you and me. They simply forgot. The truth of God, which gives freedom and life, was not a part of their daily diet, so their souls began to stray, and their lifestyles followed.\n\nI am always amazed at how easily we forget. No matter what God does, we forget. Without the “daily bread” of His Word, we can’t remember how to live. That is why, I suspect, there is a deeper invitation behind the simple words, “Hear the word of the Lord.” It’s not just a call to listen, but a call to life.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, and mom of two boys.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hosea 5:1-15, Isaiah 29:15-16, Revelation 3:19\n\nWe’d picked out the brown velvet curtains at Ikea not long after we got married, and hemmed them with the iron-on adhesive strip that came in the package. They hung in our first home and then in our second, even though they were about a foot too short with the higher ceilings and taller windows. I always meant to get around to changing them, or at least mending the falling-out hem; but come 2009, I decided I didn’t mind.\n\nShe was 2 years old that year, with wild, thin hair that stuck straight up and a smile so bright it could knock you out. Those too-short curtains were the perfect hiding place for her new favorite game: hide and seek.\n\nI have a few precious minutes of video of the usual scene: our little girl hiding conspicuously behind the brown dining room curtains, her pink sneakers poking out at the bottom and her giggle audible from the other side of the room. Her papa would sneak up slowly and the giggles would get louder, and she would squeal with delight as he threw back the curtain. Hiding was fun, but the true joy was being found.\n\nHosea chapter 5 is a painful read. Israel was playing hide and seek with her God, but this was no game. The people’s very lives were at stake, yet they kept turning to dead idols that reaped only destruction and desolation.\n\nGod warned them through the prophet. His tone, gentle and wooing in the first chapters, had become booming, insistent, firm. The call from the Lord was clear: Come back to Me. If you run, disaster awaits. I’m not saying it might destroy you; I’m saying it will.\n\nYet Israel was “determined to follow what is worthless” (v. 11). In verse 4, the prophet proclaimed:\n\n“Their actions do not allow them\n\nto return to their God,\n\nfor a spirit of promiscuity is among them,\n\nand they do not know the Lord.”\n\nThe sin did not disqualify them from returning and repenting; it kept them from returning and repenting. God’s warning to Israel was His mercy to them; so was His discipline. God turned away so that they might turn back to Him (v. 15).\n\nThe priests and the people of Israel hid in their idolatry and their sacrifices, hoping their rituals might hide their hearts. But there is no hiding from God. He sees all; and, even more, He knows all (v. 3). But as we often do, Israel hid anyway, their tell-tale sneakers sticking out from under the curtains of their sin. We hide, believing we know better, believing we and our “little-g” gods can outsmart the one true God.\n\nWe hide, but He seeks us out. He seeks us out so that we will seek Him.\n\nIsrael’s attempts at deceiving God resulted in her injury, just as He said it would. She turned to her little-g gods for healing (v. 13), and God kept pursuing. Like a lion, He prowled in guard of her heart, doing whatever it took to frustrate her desires for lesser loves, to thwart her attempts to run and hide (v. 14).\n\nAre you hiding today? I am. I feel the Holy Spirit calling my heart to return from places where I’ve gone to hide from my sin, to hide from my own brokenness. Hear our God speak words of hard, merciful truth to us, His children:\n\nI know you, He says. You are not hidden from me.\n\nYou turn to false loves, but they cannot cure you. They cannot heal your wounds.\n\nSeek me. Return and repent (vv. 3, 14-15, my paraphrase).\n\nDear friend, there is joy in having the darkest parts of our hearts uncovered by our merciful Father. Surrender to the knowledge that you are known. You’ve been found out, you’ve been found, and you are loved.\n\n",

I truly and passionately loved God, so if that’s where the faith-action was, then that’s where I wanted to be. \n\nTo a wide-eyed high-schooler, anxious for adventure and an uncommon life, the abnormality of mission work appealed to me. I was ready to sacrifice BIG for God. But if I’m honest, that was mostly because I thought a missionary life sounded kind of flashy—daring, and even religiously “successful.”\n\nI took a handful of short-term trips (which, in all reality, probably benefitted me more than the people I went to serve), but I never became a career missionary, not in the way I had pictured, anyway. I was willing, but God had a different plan for my life. Today, my “mission field” looks strangely more like my childhood home than the jungles of the Amazon. \n\nMaybe you’ve wrestled through that tension, too. Can we be faithful to God in the ordinary, or do we have to do “big things” for God for our faith to be legitimate? \n\nIn Ephesians 4:1, Paul urges believers to “live worthy of the calling [we] have received.” But what does that actually look like? Hosea 6:6 helps us: \n\n“For I desire faithful love and not sacrifice,\n\nthe knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.”\n\nThis verse shows us what God considers the highest devotion to Him, what He wants most: faithful love over sacrifice, a relationship with Him over our offerings.\n\nHave you ever had a nagging suspicion that giant sacrifices come more easily than quiet faithfulness? I have. It was easier to dream of living in a foreign land, leading whole villages to Christ, than it is to actually live a quiet, largely unknown, completely unflashy, but faithful life. To be loyal to God even when His plan for me doesn’t make for a great Christmas card.\n\nGod still expected the Israelites to bring the prescribed offerings and sacrifices to the altar. But those things weren’t what He wanted most of all. \n\nSo why would God prefer loyalty and faithfulness over big sacrifices? The answer is the echo of the love story woven throughout the Bible’s pages: God wants our hearts. He is jealous for our affection. He wants loyalty and faithfulness because that’s what you bring to the table when you are hopelessly in love with someone. He wants us to be head-over-heels for Him, and when we are, sacrifices will come easily. \n\nWhether our faithfulness takes us to the ends of the earth or leaves us right where we are, remember what He’s really after: us.\n\nJessie Minassian is an author, blogger, and speaker, who prefers to be known for her ability to laugh at herself, a weird obsession with nature-ish stuff, and a penchant for making up words.

Ephraim is unturned bread baked on a griddle. Foreigners consume his strength, but he does not notice. Even his hair is streaked with gray, but he does not notice. Israel’s arrogance testifies against them, yet they do not return to the Lᴏʀᴅ their God, and for all this, they do not seek him” (Hosea 7:8-10).\n\nHave you noticed something here?\n\nEphraim (the largest of the ten northern tribes, whose name is sometimes used to refer to Israel as a whole) has become an out-of-control, hot mess. Meanwhile, the people of Israel are so crazed with self-indulgence they can hardly tell what day it is. But I can’t help standing back a bit and noticing, in all of Israel’s wayward mindlessness as they run to Egypt and Assyria and every which way, God hasn’t changed.\n\nOh, He’s definitely watching. He sees them spiraling out of control, tossing their reputation out the window. He hears the other nations all whispering to each other about “God’s Chosen People” killing off their leaders, one by one, and getting fresh starts from their God, only to get all muddy again (Hosea 7:16).\n\nIsrael is two-faced and double-tongued.\n\nBut if we turn our attention from the squeaky wheel for a moment—if we tune out all the noise—we’ll notice this: God has not changed.\n\nHe has but one face and one tongue. One unrelenting love for His bride.\n\nWe want this passage to be about the rogue bride, or the prodigal son, and how Israel can’t seem to get it right. But it isn’t. It’s about God.\n\nGod’s character never changes. His one face is righteousness. His one Word is holiness. His one undying call to His people is love.\n\nAs the ever-faithful Groom, God remains. Even as His anger burns over the unfaithfulness of His bride, He forgives her. He provides for her. He gives her a fresh start. And in His severe mercy, He even withholds good things from her so that she might return to Him. While Israel hedges its bets on other gods, the Groom has all His focus on His one, true love.\n\nMaybe you don’t need me to spell it out for you today, but in case you do, hear this: you are His one, true love. Wherever you are, whatever you’ve done, whatever anyone else thinks of you, and however long it’s been since the last time you called Him your Groom—He hasn’t changed, and neither has His love for you. \n\n“But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us!”\n\n-Romans 5:8\n\n",

Pushing hard against a plow through air. Carefully planting seeds of air. Sweat beading down as you pull weeds from the air. No matter how determined and sincere the Israelites might have been in their efforts, they were applied to an absolutely immovable force: the wind, a force of nature. \n\nAll those miracles right in front of their faces, day after day, and still they were crouching out back, hammering little bits of metal together to fashion some other god to worship. It’s as if they were eager to put themselves in harm’s way, intentionally hunting down ways to insult and abandon the One who had loved and cared for and rescued them time after time. Israel was “a wild donkey wandering alone” (Hosea 8:9). They were a ridiculous people, trying to sow the wind.\n\nIn reality, we’re not so different from the Israelites. \n\nFear and pain and loss surround us. They threaten to rip out our hearts and swallow us whole. Daily we’re tempted to rely on our most sincere plans, determined to live out of our own strength. We strive hard to pile up some measure of security in an unstable world. Whether it’s on the job or in our relationships, we labor at the plow, striving to produce something—anything—that will prove our significance.\n\nWe avoid. We manipulate. We shop. We control. We produce. We sow the wind. We hope, but we hope in the wrong things. \n\nBut “this is what the Sovereign LORD, the Holy One of Israel, says: ‘In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength, but you would have none of it’” (Isaiah 30:15). The Israelites were sinners, just like me and you. But, praise the Lord, Jesus came for wind-sowers like us (Mark 2:17).\n\nYes, life is painfully hard and the giants in the land are real. We are not enough for any of it, but He is. He offers us rest from our endless plowing. He offers us Himself. \n\nOur wrestling and questioning may never end. Sin will continually call us back to our self-sufficient wandering. But when we turn to God and repent, we exchange our demands of Him for trust in Him. When we recall His faithfulness, we’ll see we can put down our idol-making hammers and put all our faith in Him. And faith in Him is never in vain. \n\nLaura Pierce is a homeschooling, public-schooling, and private-schooling mom to six kids, ages 5 to 17.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hosea 9:1-17, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, Psalm 51:1-12\n\nMy favorite room in our house is the dining room. True, it may be because we eat food there (and I do love food), but it’s more than that. It’s because of the way it makes me feel. I can’t put words to it exactly, but I knew it the first time I set foot in that room: it was home.\n\nThe intangible quality of feeling “at home” is as hard to replicate as it is to describe, but it is nonetheless deeply real—so real that we spend our lives trying to find it, create it, hang on to it. That’s why I can’t bear to change the color of our green paint-over-panel dining room walls. I want it to always feel the way it did the day I stood in the doorway and cried because I knew I was home.\n\nHosea chapter 9 is about home, but not the warm, fuzzy feeling I get when I walk into my green dining room at the end of a long day. Israel had forfeited all opportunities for true joy in their lives, in their families, and in their homes. Their blatant and persistent sin meant they were no longer welcome in God’s presence, not until they returned with repentant hearts.\n\nBut Israel was not interested in repentance. Instead, they settled into their sin, becoming at home in their shame. Listen to the sadness in the Lord’s description of their turning away from Him and unto their false loves:\n\nI discovered Israel\n\nlike grapes in the wilderness.\n\nI saw your fathers\n\nlike the first fruit of the fig tree in its first season.\n\nBut they went to Baal-peor,\n\nconsecrated themselves to Shame,\n\nand became detestable,\n\nlike the thing they loved.\n\n– Hosea 9:10\n\nGod’s people were called to be holy—set apart for Him alone. But they instead set themselves apart for Shame, the very opposite of their holy, just, and loving Father. What choice did He have but to kick them out of His house?\n\nI will drive them from My house\n\nbecause of their evil, wicked actions.\n\nI will no longer love them…\n\n– Hosea 9:15\n\nAnd that’s where the story would end without the gospel—with me, you, and Israel, sitting on the curb next to a heap of our idols, none of them able to save us or give us a forever home. There we would stay, bound to our shame and humiliation.\n\nShame is not the same as repentance, nor is humiliation the same as humility. It is not enough to be aware of our sin, wallowing in our brokenness. We must (and we may!) repent and return to our holy, gracious God.\n\nPraise the Lord, He loves even the wanderers. He seeks us out and beckons us home by the perfect sacrifice of His Son, Jesus. The Holy One invites us to exchange our worship of impotent idols for worship of Him, the only living God. He washes us of our guilt, breaks our chains of sin and shame, and binds us to Himself. Thanks be to God, we “who were far away have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah” (Ephesians 2:13).\n\nIn Christ, we are at home. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Hosea 10:1-15, Matthew 11:28, Psalm 25:12-22\n\nThere are some passages of Scripture that are really hard to read because they don’t tell us pleasant things. This passage in Hosea is one of them; it talks to us about sin and about its undeniable consequences.\n\nI like it best when I can imagine Jesus patting me on the shoulder, saying, “Well done, good and faithful servant” (Matthew 25:23). But instead of patting me on the back, Hosea 10 kicks me in the pants.\n\nWhy would God say all this to us? Why can’t we skip over the nasty parts and hear about something nice instead?\n\nThe truth is, we cannot fully understand the gospel without this very real and difficult realization of sin. The gospel isn’t a “skip over the difficult stuff” message. It’s the answer to an ugly, deeply rooted problem in our hearts. On their own, our hearts aren’t naturally inclined to seek the Lord and do what’s right.\n\nWe may like to claim a kind of made-up righteousness of our own, but those are “mere words” and “false oaths” (Hosea 10:4). In truth, apart from God’s bountiful grace, we are like Israel. Our actions reveal what we really believe, that “we do not fear the Lᴏʀᴅ” (v. 3). That’s frightening, because Hosea tells us where all this leads: shame, judgment, and war. \n\nBut even in this passage about the darkness of sin, God shines a light for us. When God calls us to “sow righteousness” (v. 12), He’s not simply commanding us—He’s also beckoning to us. God is throwing a rope down into the well to pull us up out of the darkness and muck of our sin. \n\nFrom the deep pit of our own destruction and despair, we hear a steady, loving voice calling even now: \n\n“Sow righteousness for yourselves and reap faithful love; break up your unplowed ground. It is time to seek the Lᴏʀᴅ until he comes and sends righteousness on you like the rain. . .  Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Hosea 10:12; Matthew 11:28).\n\nHosea is a book about God’s wooing of an undeserving people. While the reality of our sin may make us want to run from God, the reminder that He desires good for us, not destruction, draws us close. Difficult passages like this remind us that God longs for our wandering hearts to return to Him and receive His cleansing grace. \n\nLet’s not wallow in our shame, but instead run with abandon back to our loving Father. As we do, He will continue to pursue us as He always has, to rescue us from even the deepest darkness of our hearts.\n\n \n\n",

I brushed off each one, shaking out the pages as dust particles danced in the sunlight. That’s how I found it—a torn strip of paper sticking out of the top of an old paperback. The words were written in crayon, in my handwriting: Mama, we’re always in the family, right? \n\nAs soon as I saw it I remembered. It was about two years ago, and all three of our children had become adorably addicted to affirmation. When they got into trouble, or sometimes just because, they would ask the question again. I’d written it down so I’d remember.\n\n“Mama, we’re always in the family, right?” Yes, of course, we’d say. You will always, always be part of this family. \n\nThey haven’t asked the question lately, now that I think of it. I hope this means they’re learning what it means to be a beloved child. \n\nWe’ve come a long way in the book of Hosea. We’ve seen Israel struggle to believe that God is who He says He is. We’ve seen them struggle to repent and obey. And while the whole book makes us ache with recognition of our own sin, these verses at the start of chapter 11 have to be among the most heartbreaking. \n\nWhen Israel was a child, I loved him,\n\nand out of Egypt I called My son.\n\nThe more they called them,\n\nthe more they departed from Me.\n\nThey kept sacrificing to the Baals\n\nand burning offerings to idols.\n\nIt was I who taught Ephraim to walk,\n\ntaking them in My arms,\n\nbut they never knew that I healed them.\n\n– Hosea 11:1-3\n\nGod had been with Israel from the beginning—loving them, providing for them, healing them, leading them “with ropes of love” (v. 4). He was faithfully their Father, but they had forgotten what it meant to be His beloved children. \n\nIt’s not hard to imagine ourselves in Israel’s shoes. Those shoes are where we live. We forget. We are unfaithful. We ignore the hand who heals us. But our sin is not the headline here. The headline is God’s faithfulness. \n\n“How can I give you up?” He asked His children, while they continued to wander in their idolatry (Hosea 11:8). Jesus echoed God the Father’s heart in the Gospel of John: “Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never cast out… This is the will of Him who sent Me: that I should lose none of those He has given Me” (John 6:37, 39). \n\nGod’s people scatter in their sin, yet Christ will lose none—not a single one. I am not the exception to that rule. Neither are you. \n\nIt’s true that we are Israel-caliber sinners. We get lost, wandering through the wilderness of our idolatry. But even when we’re lost, He never loses us. The Lion of Judah will roar as necessary, and His children will return to Him, trembling (Hosea 11:10). Trembling, but at home. \n\nChild of the Father, receive this affirmation today from God’s Word. The One who was with you in the beginning, who has raised you up as His beloved child, will not forsake you now. The sacrifice of His Son has covered your sin, secured your standing, and sealed your hope (Col. 1:14, Rom. 5:17, 1 Pet. 1:3-4). \n\nWith Jesus as your Redeemer, you are always in the family.\n\n",

Moving from the flat Midwest to a state of unending mountains, there is a certain peer pressure to become a more outdoorsy girl—the type who likes to hike. The problem is that hiking sounds wonderful to me in theory, but the reality of slowly trudging up and up and up is not always as fun.\n\nSo a couple hours into a spontaneous hike with my husband, I was ready to be done. Tired, hungry, and lost, it felt like we were getting nowhere and only increasing our chances of being eaten by a bear. Growing “hangrier” by the minute, I convinced my husband—at this point, probably more afraid of being eaten by me rather than a bear—to head back. \n\nAbout 50 feet back down the worn path, a woman came walking in the direction we had just abandoned.\n\nThis woman had hiked these woods before and she knew the mountaintop was just out of sight, beyond the ridge. She assured us the view from there was absolutely breathtaking and worth every inch of hiking heartache. How could we give up now knowing we were so close? \n\nFeeling a bit foolish, we did a 180-degree about-face, and with renewed hope in our step, we ascended to a clearing. Sitting in silence, staring out at mountains for miles, I realized what we would’ve missed if that woman had not encouraged us to keep going.\n\nIn our walk with God, it can be just as easy to get distracted, tired, and lost along the way. \n\nDo you ever feel like you’ve drifted too far from God to ever come back? Maybe you’re lost in the forest and don’t know just how close the mountaintop really is.\n\nThe book of Hosea reminds us that even when we are unfaithful, God is faithful. Even when we’ve given up, God pursues us. Our God called Hosea to take up a prostitute as his wife and be relentlessly compassionate to her. This demonstrated God’s character and just how much He loved wayward Israel—how He loves us, too, rebellious sinners though we are.\n\nGod declares loud and clear that there is nothing you can do to lose the Father’s love (Romans 8:31-39). \n\nIt can be difficult for us to really grasp the unfailing love of God because it seems so counterintuitive to the way we operate out of our humanity. When we’re hurt, our instinct is often to hurt someone in return or withdraw our love altogether. When people disappoint us time and again, we start to give up on them. To think we can hurt and disappoint God endlessly, yet He still draws near to us, is unfathomable! \n\nOur Lord isn’t some begrudging judge, waiting for us to shape up on our own. He comes to rescue us, helping us turn back to Him (Hosea 12:6). He is the loving Father, running unashamedly toward His prodigal child (Luke 15:20). He is the Good Shepherd who goes off in search of just one lost sheep (Luke 15:4).\n\nSometimes the climb is tedious and disheartening and downright painful. In those moments it’s tempting to give up and turn away. But what we might not be able to see through the trees is the most magnificent view up ahead: our gracious Father, extending His arms and calling us home.  \n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

They should know better.\n\nThese people we’re reading about—the ones who “continue to sin” and kiss golden calves (Hosea 13:2)—are God’s people. The Chosen Ones. The ones He brought out of slavery in Egypt and provided for in crazy, miraculous ways. The ones He has been calling to Himself for whole chapters and books of the Bible, year after year, generation after generation. \n\nStill, thirteen chapters into the book of Hosea, no clanging cymbal or shockingly graphic simile is enough to shake Israel out of their sin and cause them to turn and repent. \n\nGod gave Israel food and water in the wilderness, but just as soon as they were satisfied, they forgot why they needed Him in the first place (Hosea 13:6). God is angry with Israel. Shoot, by this point, I’m angry with Israel.\n\nBut Ephraim isn’t the only chaff swirling around on the threshing floor (v. 3).\n\nThat’s me, too, Lord. Isn’t it?\n\nAnd so, our frustration with the Chosen People for being so maddeningly unfaithful to their Helper, turns inward. Their “He’ll be here when we need Him” attitude—putting God in a box on a shelf in case of emergency—sounds disquietingly familiar. \n\nEven waist deep into the book of Hosea, we may find we’re still not giving God the place He deserves in our lives—not up high on some shelf in a box, but on our door frames and at our tables and on our tongues (Deuteronomy 6:6-9). We belong in relationship with Him.\n\nWe may also realize that, like Ephraim, we sometimes talk about God’s grace like it’s a get-out-of-jail-free card (Romans 6:15). We can think of His anger as some kind of scare tactic, where we keep our heads down and toe the line. That might have worked for another generation, but it doesn’t really intimidate us anymore.\n\nBut God still knows us, even as we wander in the wilderness of our sin. He wants our hearts back. So He reminds us, “you know no God but Me, and no Savior exists besides Me” (Hosea 13:4). Amen?\n\nWe are broken, but He is faithful. We are rebellious, but He pursues. We stray. We become prideful and forget who He is. But our change doesn’t change Him. He still wants us back. And He comes for us. Oh, that we would always be amazed by His all-sufficient grace. \n\nWe are more unfaithful than we ever dared believe, but the God of Israel—and of our hearts—is far more faithful than we ever dared hope. Let’s go before our holy God today to thank Him for not giving up on us, even in our darkest moments.\n\n\n\n",

I’m a slave to affection, to being loved, to gaining approval. I am an apostate, abandoning my faith and refusing to believe the gospel’s fullness for my life and heart. I buy my way into the affections of others by being winsome, being faithful, being silent, being whatever they need in that moment. \n\nI make a mockery of it—of the extravagant act of mercy the Son of God made on my behalf—every time I go on sinning so that grace may abound (Romans 6:1). I play hard to get, while at the same time longing to be caught in His infinite love and grace. I know the Truth in my head and struggle to wrestle it into my heart. \n\nLike Gomer, what I fail to see is I am already caught. I’m already the bride of the King of the universe, and I bear His name (Isaiah 54:5). I twist myself to repent of my apostasy, yet God says He alone will heal it (Hosea 14:4). He doesn’t just undo my sin; He heals it because I cannot.\n\nHe loves us freely, without cost, without money:\n\n“Come, everyone who thirsts,\n\ncome to the waters;\n\nand he who has no money,\n\ncome, buy and eat!\n\nCome, buy wine and milk\n\nwithout money and without price.\n\nWhy do you spend your money for that which is not bread,\n\nand your labor for that which does not satisfy?\n\nListen diligently to me, and eat what is good,\n\nand delight yourselves in rich food.”\n\n–  Isaiah 55:1-2\n\nGod’s love is wholly distinct and different from ours. God is love, while Hosea can only give love. Love is who God is (1 John 4:8). He cannot help but love fully, without cost to those He loves, save one: His Son.\n\nThere is nothing that can be done to earn God’s love; this is the primary message of the book of Hosea. In the face of adultery, abandonment, idolatry, deceitfulness—His love remains, without cost, without money. He remains and He loves us freely. \n\nAs you finish reading the book of Hosea, the illustration of God’s extravagant love and our constant rebellion, lift up your eyes from your sin. See your God, your Maker, your Groom in the fullness of who He is and what He has done. Stop twisting yourself to win His affection, and stop trying to heal your own rebellious heart. He has already chosen you—yes, you—to be His bride. \n\nBe His bride. Be healed. Be loved, Beloved. \n\n“I trust in God’s faithful love forever and ever. I will praise You forever for what You have done. In the presence of Your faithful people, I will put my hope in Your name, for it is good.”\n\n-Psalm 52:8-9\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

Those who walked the streets with Jesus, who encountered His teaching in the synagogues, who witnessed Him healing the sick and eating with sinners—they were compelled to understand who this man was. That was 2,000 years ago. And here we are, asking the same question today.\n\nEven now, sitting in my Nashville office, surrounded by modern technology and Western comforts, I can think of no more foundational question to ask. The answer frames what I believe about God. It frames what I know about myself and how I view the world around me. And, on one hand, my response as a Christian is simple: Jesus is the Son of God. But because that is true, is there not infinitely more to know?\n\nTheologian Charles Hodge said, “The gospel is so simple that small children can understand it, and it is so profound that studies by the wisest theologians will never exhaust its riches.” I believe he’s right, and I believe the same is true with the central figure of that gospel, the person of Jesus Christ. We cannot exhaust the depth of Him, but we can know Him. \n\nThe Gospel of Matthew is a great place to start. \n\nBeginning with a genealogy, Matthew lays out his account of who Jesus is: the Messiah that the Jewish people—and the world—had been waiting for. He presents Jesus as the Son of God, born of the Holy Spirit, baptized by a prophet, and tempted by the devil. He shows Jesus as teacher, healer, servant, and friend—a man who walked the earth but was not bound by it. \n\nIn telling us who Jesus is, Matthew tells the story of our salvation. \n\nIt is a story written from the foundation of the world (Matthew 25:34). In these two chapters alone, our historian Matthew references five Old Testament prophecies fulfilled in Christ’s birth (1:22; 2:5, 15, 17, 23). He is Immanuel, “God with us,” the one who “will save his people from their sins” (1:23, 21). Jesus is not just part of this story—He is the story. \n\nI hope you’ll read along with us these next four weeks as we explore Matthew’s Gospel together and discover the true answers to that all-important question. Jesus is the Son of God. He is the Savior, the Christ, the Messiah. \n\nThis is the story Matthew tells. This is Jesus.\n\n \n\n",

While waiting for the exam, I looked at the framed diploma on the wall assuring me that this doctor had gone to medical school and successfully received her degree in ophthalmology. Can you imagine if instead of an ophthalmology degree hanging on the wall, it was a degree in something like culinary arts? I don’t want an eye doctor certified in making soufflés. I want an eye doctor certified in treating eyes. \n\nWhere someone’s authority comes from matters. It matters to us today, and it mattered to those present during the events recorded in Matthew’s Gospel.\n\nEveryone in the Galilee region was asking the same question: Who is Jesus? Some asked it aloud but probably all who came in contact with Him asked it to themselves. If Jesus was a rabbi or a prophet, that would have given Him some authority, but not authority over everything. However, if Jesus was the Son of God, that would give Him full authority. That would mean that everything He did was worth watching. Everything He said worth listening to and abiding by. \n\nThis is why the identification of Jesus in Matthew 3 is so pivotal to the gospel story. Present at Jesus’ baptism were those who were skeptical of Him, such as the Pharisees, as well as some who believed, such as John the Baptist. In front of them all, the Father answered everyone’s question: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased” (Matthew 3:17). \n\nThe declaration of Jesus’ authority mattered greatly that day. Jesus was beginning His ministry. He would go on to perform miracles and heal countless numbers of people. If He was doing so by any name other than the Father’s, if His miracles were performed through anyone other than the Holy Spirit, His authority during His ministry would be undermined, as well as the work that was done on the cross.\n\nAuthority matters. \n\nLater in chapter four, Satan tempts Jesus. What was Satan’s strategy? To question Jesus’ authority. You can’t turn this rock to bread…The angels don’t really answer to you…You are not actually in control of anything here. It’s the same strategy Satan uses to tempt us. He wants us to question Jesus’ authority, to look outside of Christ for guidance. To bow down to other idols. To look to fulfillment in other things. \n\nIf Jesus is not the authority in our lives, something else will be, someone else will be. \n\nScripture says the devil left Jesus when Jesus quoted these words from the law: “Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him” (Matthew 4:10). Satan knew he stood no chance against someone who was clear about the authority in His life. He stands no chance against us, if we are clear about the authority that is ours in Christ Jesus. \n\nWho is Jesus in your life? \n\nDoes He have authority? Is He the Son of God, or, when it comes down to it, is His role more that of a rabbi’s? A good teacher, but not the be-all-end-all? How we answer this question determines what or who has authority over our life. May it be the Son of God, and may we say with boldness today, “Him only do I serve.”  \n\n",

We clip our fighting short as we walk into the sanctuary; we can’t bring our pettiness into a holy place.\n\nIf only my day-to-day shenanigans really could be glossed over by washing my hair and putting clean trousers on the children every Sunday. If only our knack for welcoming visitors and taking communion would do the trick and show God how truly worthy we are.\n\nA few weeks ago, I stood in the sanctuary, hemmed in by my moderately clean children and propped up by my fashion-booties. We were singing hymns to the glory of God, and in the whirl of wrangling and worshiping I realized I was holding a child instead of the papers with the sheet music. Looking down, I saw that my papers lay under the delicately beautiful foot of an elderly woman on my left. You have to understand that I was in a hurry, wanting to keep on with the worshiping and the children and the swell of holiness.\n\nI had seen in the past magicians who could grab hold of one corner of a white tablecloth and quickly sweep it off a beautifully set table without disturbing the china or the candles that lay upon it. I had the idea that I could apply this same principle to my situation.\n\nKneeling down and holding the paper tightly in my fingers, I wish I had paused to consider that the success of the service doesn’t depend on me—we are the imperfect participants in a holy circus. Our antics are always going to be a little ridiculous. We try to do what is right, but still end up failing ridiculously, even at the moments when we should be at our very best.\n\nThe problem is that no amount of hand-waving hallelujahs, or giving of holy kisses, will make us what we ought to be. My own doings do not number me with the merciful, the peacemakers, or the pure in heart. It is tempting to think that by substituting my own Sunday morning showmanship, I can actually abolish the real law. But, as He stated in His Sermon on the Mount, Christ came to establish the law, and also to fulfill it (Matthew 5:17).\n\nAnd there is the answer: He fulfills it. Not me. He is the true peacemaker, the one who suffered for righteousness, the saltiness of the salt, the true light of the world. My antics, even at their highest and most “expert” level, are still filthy rags. Jesus laid it out for us, saying, “For I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven” (v. 20).\n\nAnd hallelujah to that. Those Pharisees worked harder than anybody at getting the holy hoedown exactly right, and even those perfectionists couldn’t do it. Thanks be to God that my salvation doesn’t depend on me.\n\nEven if I am careful, I can’t retrieve my worship folder without disturbing the ankle of a very elegant and elderly woman. But at the time, I didn’t think of all this, so I just gave it a sharp yank. We were both surprised and, I think, we were probably both a little disappointed in me. But then we sighed, raised our tambourine hands, and continued to worship. Our imperfection is written on our lips and our feet. But they are the tools we have, so we keep on worshiping.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:1-34, Matthew 7:1-29, 1 Chronicles 29:11-13, 1 John 2:28-29\n\nPull up a chair, girls. We’re going to have a conversation about intimacy. Yep—“husband and wife” intimacy. It may very well make you blush, but I promise to keep it PG, and I promise it’s all part of a very important point.\n\nThe Bible often refers to the Church as the Bride of Christ (2 Corinthians 11:2, Ephesians 5:22-33). Our relationship with Jesus is like a marriage—but in a perfect way. He makes us beautiful, then admires us as we walk down the aisle toward Him on our wedding day (Revelation 19:6-9). Perfectly pure. Impeccably white. Kind of awesome.\n\nSo now comes that part about intimacy.\n\nLet’s say, physically speaking, there are varying levels of intimacy. Those levels might begin with any sort of public display of affection and graduate all the way to the most intimate, behind-closed-doors, one-flesh moments meant to be shared only between a husband and wife. It’s really nobody’s business, and it’s deeply personal. A husband and wife are, indeed, one flesh. The intimate covenant they share, like Christ’s covenant with us, is sacred. \n\nWhen it comes to our relationship with God, it can be the same way. There’s PDA and then there’s sacred intimacy. There are grand public gestures of skywriting and singing telegrams (praying on the street corner “to be seen by people,” as Matthew put it in 6:5). And then there is knowing the love language of God: taking time in secret to show Him the only affections you’re chasing after are His. Pursuing Him privately, closing the doors, enjoying sacred intimacy.\n\nAny relationship that only goes as deep as public displays, or mere physical intimacy without an emotional bond and commitment, is not true intimacy. This is what Jesus warns the crowds about in Matthew 6:1, “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. Otherwise, you will have no reward with your Father in heaven.”\n\nJesus doesn’t want your love to be a spectacle. He wants it to be sacred. He wants you to seek Him and His kingdom first, before everything and everyone else (Matthew 6:33). \n\nIn a marriage—in any relationship that lasts past the honeymoon phase—intimacy takes intentionality. Sometimes it takes scheduling regular dates on the calendar, even committing to block out distractions and making space for, ahem, intimacy on a regular basis. Intimacy can be enjoyed organically, only when it is supported intentionally. Jesus told us this: “But when you pray, go into your private room, shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret” (Matthew 6:6).\n\nHow are you pursuing intimacy as the Bride of Christ? Are you intentionally closing the doors, scheduling dates, and setting aside time in order for your relationship to deepen? Or are you publically kissing Him, then living as strangers at home? Is your prayer life simply a spectacle, or is it spectacularly sacred?\n\nTo know Jesus personally is to be in loving relationship with Him, one where He longs to be gracious to us because He loves us (Isaiah 30:18). The God who calls us His treasured possession is also the greatest treasure our hearts will ever know (Deuteronomy 7:6; Matthew 6:21). The intimacy and acceptance we crave is waiting for us. \n\n“Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.” \n\n– Matthew 7:7\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 8:1-34, 2 Samuel 22:16, Isaiah 53:4-5\n\nReading Matthew 8 reminds me of Sunday School. Every story—six of them in just 34 verses—is familiar, conjuring up memories of flannel boards and coloring pages from my elementary school days. Jesus heals a leper, He calms a storm, He casts out the demons into pigs … it’s like a WOW! That’s What We Call Miracles Greatest Hits compilation. If you grew up in the Church, you know these stories. \n\nWhen we know Bible stories like the back of our hand, we risk missing the miraculous. Perhaps more importantly though, we read them as just that—stories. But these stories are true. And more than true, they are promises. Each story is not just a historical event, something that Jesus did. Rather, they are glimpses of everything that Jesus will do. \n\nIn his book The Reason for God, Tim Keller writes:\n\nWe modern people think of miracles as the suspension of the natural order, but Jesus meant them to be the restoration of the natural order. The Bible tells us that God did not originally make the world to have disease, hunger, and death in it. Jesus has come to redeem where it is wrong and heal the world where it is broken. His miracles are not just proofs that he has power but also wonderful foretastes of what he is going to do with that power. Jesus’ miracles are not just a challenge to our minds, but a promise to our hearts, that the world we all want is coming.\n\nThe miracles of Matthew 8 are about people in a specific place and time. They are about a leper, a centurion and his servant, Peter’s mother-in-law, the disciples on an angry sea, and two men with demons. But each miracle is also about the Israelites who wandered and trusted the God who promised them that one day their King would come. Each miracle is about the Jews, torn away from Jerusalem, listening to Isaiah prophesy that a Messiah would come to take on their illnesses and bear their diseases. And each miracle is about us, with our mix of ancient faith and modern doubt. Each miracle proved to the Jewish people then and teaches us now that Jesus is who He says He is, that He fulfilled God’s promises, and that He will fulfill them again. \n\nI risk reading this passage purely at face value: people needed help, they asked Jesus, and He helped them, healing the dying and rescuing the scared disciples. In my own life, I am tempted to pray with the same expectation for earthly healing and immediate help. Every prayer is my own version of “calm the storm, Jesus!” But my own experience has taught me that Jesus doesn’t always work that way. Matthew is telling us that while Jesus can do all we could ever ask or imagine, He may not always answer our earthly needs in the way we think He should. Is it enough for me to know that the One who makes even the winds and sea obey Him will also makes everything new one day? (Matthew 8:27; Revelation 21:5).\n\nSo I continue to pray for miracles, yes. I pray with faithful expectation, and sometimes, with honest doubt. I live in the tension of the already and the not yet. \n\nGod has already fulfilled His promises, and we know that we can trust Him. But He has not yet fully restored His kingdom—what Keller called “the world we all want.” So we wait and pray, hope and trust. And we read these stories about Jesus, and take heart because we know they were true then, and they are just as true for us today.\n\nMelanie Rainer is the director of content for JellyTelly, where she writes and edits family spiritual formation resources.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 9:1-38, Numbers 19:11-21, Hosea 2:19-20\n\nI committed an embarrassing crime in my favorite pair of boots. With double-knotted laces and heels worn from hopscotch, those shoes supported me during some of my best moments, from resting on foot pedals during piano recitals to walking across the stage to accept awards for reading and attendance. They were impressive shoes for an equally impressive first grader, or so I thought.\n\nAnd then one day, I stepped off the school bus and sat at the kitchen table to begin my homework. From here, the details get a little foggy. All I know is that a light-hearted family conversation escalated to a hearty quarrel when I stood up, angrily seeking my next victim. Without my brain’s permission, my foot swung backward to gain momentum and forward to meet a target. I kicked a hole in my parents’ couch—not a small one, either.\n\nWhile my parents were certainly less than pleased, they soon realized this deed came with a built-in punishment. After the couch had to be moved down the stairs, out the door, and across town to be repaired, I would have to explain to any guests why we temporarily had no place for them to sit.\n\n“Oh, the couch? I broke it.”\n\nWhen I remember this story, I sometimes wonder if we’re all walking around with our own versions of kicked-in couches, whatever they may be, always aware of our brokenness.\n\nMy family? We’re struggling.\n\nMy job? It’s difficult.\n\nMy body? It’s hurting.\n\nMy heart? It’s suffering.\n\nMy circumstances? They’re unfair. \n\nIn Matthew 9, we find person after person in physical suffering, and yet, Jesus’ response to each one is very similar.\n\n“Have courage, your sins are forgiven” (v. 2).\n\n“Get up and walk” (v. 6).\n\n“Have courage, your faith has saved you” (v. 22).\n\n“Let it be done according to your faith” (v. 29). \n\nHere, Jesus isn’t telling us to brush ourselves off from the hurt; He is showing us what it means to be whole again. It’s more than the healing of our bodies, our families, or any other shattered piece we may be holding. True healing can only be found through forgiveness, and ultimately, through Jesus’ broken body and shed blood. He knew that “it is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are sick… For [He] didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners (Matthew 9:12-13).\n\nJesus calls out a truth that maybe we’re too afraid or wrapped up in our circumstances to admit: Broken lives require faith. We may not know what to do with broken pieces and messy circumstances, but He certainly knows what to do with the bold faith of His children. Jesus uses the broken pieces to draw us to His wholeness. \n\n\n\n",

Many of us may recall the joy of receiving Christmas presents as a child. When you’re young there are no expectations of repayment; the gift is freely given, and certainly, freely taken. \n\nDo you also know what it’s like to receive a gift with strings attached? Maybe you “won” a free night at the hotel in exchange for a timeshare meeting, or your friend loaned you their car with an unspoken debt to pay. It’s not so fun to receive a gift and find out later it wasn’t really free.  \n\nThe gift of salvation can only be received freely like a child. “Life to the fullest” is free to us because our generous God paid the price with His own Son (John 10:10). Not to mention, we couldn’t pay the fair value for such a precious present, even if we tried. “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).\n\nWhen Jesus sent out His twelve disciples for the first time, He warned them about the quid-pro-quo economy of the world (Matthew 10). Jesus was well aware that when you start healing people, driving out demons, or raising people from the dead, there will be loved ones willing and eager to compensate you. \n\nBut Jesus does not want people to believe they can buy God’s love or favor. The Lord doesn’t want you to confuse the gospel with a bait-and-switch timeshare meeting. Christ warned the disciples against the temptation to take those payments. He reminded them that they had received spiritual gifts without paying for them, so they should not charge others. “Freely you received, freely give,” He instructed them (Matthew 10:8).\n\nWe might not expect our neighbor or coworker to pay us money for our encouragement or service, but do we secretly expect them to pay us back with social favors or reciprocated acts? Are there spiritual gifts the Lord has given you that He wants you to spill out onto others lavishly? If you’ve been given the spiritual gift of encouragement, encourage others in the faith freely. If God has given you the spiritual gift of service, serve with a heart of generosity. \n\nEverything we have has been given to us. When we remember that our salvation, financial resources, and spiritual gifts are purely by the grace of God, we become stewards instead of hoarders. As followers of Christ sent into the world, we are given the same instructions as the twelve disciples. Give away the most valuable gift of God’s love at no charge, because that is how we all received it—freely.  \n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 11:1-30, Isaiah 29:18-19, 1 John 5:3-4\n\nIt’s one of those moments so deeply seared onto my heart that I still glance at the memories and wince. I was in a Jamaican infirmary, tasked with offering some measure of comfort to the sick and dying housed there. Their beds were jammed together, packing every room. Conditions weren’t sanitary. Many patients wailed incessantly. My comfort-craving brain wanted to find the escape hatch, to look somewhere other than at the faces of these people I could do so little for. Maybe that’s why my eyes kept drifting out the windows at the sugary white sand and emerald blue Caribbean waters that sparkled just beyond the compound’s walls.\n\nThe juxtaposition of human sorrow and breathtaking beauty sticks with me still. Jesus was on the shore and in the suffering at the same time. We find a juxtaposition just as jarring in Matthew 11. \n\nJohn the Baptist was imprisoned for his faith, sitting on death row. Yet, Jesus was using John’s predicament as an object lesson for true discipleship when He delivered these comforting words:\n\n“Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls, For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (vv. 28-30). \n\nRest. Our bleary eyes and exhausted souls crave it, don’t they? And yet, John would remain in prison until his gruesome death. Humanly speaking, John’s yoke was not easy. His burden was not light. So, what did Jesus mean? \n\nI imagine John must have looked around his prison cell and felt tired from the weight of it all. He sent messengers to make sure Jesus had something better to offer (vv. 1-3). Our weary hearts often wonder the same thing, don’t they?\n\nJesus responds like this:\n\n“Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them” (vv. 4-5). \n\nRest from pain, suffering, and worry is certainly something we can all readily give our “Amen!” to. But then here comes that juxtaposition again—that same tension—when Jesus adds, “And blessed be the one who is not offended by me” (v. 6). \n\nWhen this world leaves me weary, I want to take a nap. But Jesus wants to give me a break from the tyranny of self. If the kind of rest Christ offers doesn’t look like I think it will, He must be promising so much more. \n\nIf a good night’s sleep and an easy life was all Jesus had to give John, it would not have been enough to keep him chained to Christ. John would die for his faith—not for a handful of miracles that had already happened, but for a tsunami of healing that was to come. Somewhere along the way, John must’ve resolved that the rest he needed most was not circumstantial. \n\nWe are all broken by sin, longing for a cure. Jesus walks among us, removing the yoke of sin that bends our backs and breaks our hearts. Suffering and sleeplessness may remain temporarily, but the burden of sin is no longer ours to carry. Jesus took that burden so we could know the kind of rest that seeps past our bones and into our weary souls.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

This made no sense to me.\n\n“Are you a vegetarian?” I asked, hoping to avoid a pitch to join the fold. (I love meat.) \n\n“Oh no,” he said. “I’m just taking a break. We went paleo for a long time and I kind of went overboard.”\n\nI laughed. Sure enough, a few years ago my husband and I decided to go Paleo too. This was before the “Whole 30” eating plan was a thing. We were simply trying to do something different with our diet, and quickly learned how easy it was to make a meal out of veggies and protein. But it was also easy to use the “Paleo” rules to fill our plates with nothing but pork, bacon, and ground beef.\n\nIt’s easy to follow the rules but ignore the spirit and intent behind them.\n\nThat’s the heart of Matthew 12. At this time in history, Pharisees were a group of devout Jewish men who had tried to keep every letter of the law. Scribes, mentioned later in the passage, were essentially lawyers—men who copied and interpreted the law of Moses for the people. Both groups knew the rules inside and out. And sure enough, they were right about the rules.\n\nIn the book of Leviticus, the Lord instructs His people not to strip the farmland bare, but to leave the final portion to the poor and to immigrants. In fact, in the book of Ruth, we see Ruth, a poor, barren immigrant woman, benefitting from that compassionate law, as she gathers grain from Boaz’s field. But intent on proving Jesus to be a hypocrite, the Pharisees point out that He was breaking two laws: the harvesting laws and the laws prohibiting work on the Sabbath.\n\nI can almost see their self-satisfied smiles as they imagine Jesus stuttering to respond. But He doesn’t miss a beat. He says He is Lord of the Sabbath because He created it (vv. 6-8). He defined rest.\n\nAnd yet, the Pharisees continue to press. Entering the temple, they point to a crippled man and ask Jesus a theoretical question, as if they can stump Him with a bit of moral philosophy. In order to accuse Him, they asked, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?” (v. 9).\n\nAre you kidding me? How prideful! How arrogant! As if they wanted to go around healing crippled people, but the Sabbath was all that was stopping them? If I were Jesus, I would have yelled, “You Pharisees couldn’t heal whether it was on the Sabbath or not! Shut your traps!”\n\nBut thankfully, Jesus is not me.\n\nHe doesn’t answer them while screaming and shouting like I would have. Instead, He exposes their hearts with a simple story that even a child could understand, making the truth abundantly clear: There is no prohibition against mercy. Only He can heal, and only He determines when to do it.\n\nScribes and Pharisees dole out burdens and rules and loopholes and philosophical arguments. Jesus delivers hope. May we put our trust in His name alone.\n\nClaire Gibson is a writer whose work has been featured in publications including The Washington Post and Entrepreneur Magazine among many others.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 13:1-52, 1 Corinthians 5:6-7\n\nUntil last year, I had never seen the movie Star Wars. This was the cinematic equivalent of blasphemy for my in-laws, my friends—pretty much everyone else in the world, really. Star Wars is part of our cultural lexicon, but when you’ve never seen it, most references to it go unnoticed. It’s as if fans of the film franchise speak another language when they talk about it. Sure, I was familiar with the line, “Luke, I am your father,” but anything more than that, and I was totally lost. I’d heard about Star Wars a lot, but I’d never understood the context of what I was hearing. And I certainly couldn’t contribute to the conversation. \n\nWhen Jesus taught in parables, He was speaking to two audiences. Some, like His disciples, understood what He was teaching. And if they didn’t understand, they would ask Jesus to explain. Others belonged to the “you will hear but never understand” camp (Matthew 13:14). Much like being a part of a conversation about a movie you’ve never seen or a book you’ve never read, the latter audience could tune out Jesus’ message. \n\nJesus knew that by speaking in parables, His message would get through to the right people—the people who would open their hearts to Him and who would work to see the kingdom of God flourish. He also knew that the people who were out to get Him (the Pharisees, the Romans) would not understand the parables, and so to some degree, parables were a protective measure. \n\nReading the parable of the sower, I wonder where I land on the spectrum of listeners. As Jesus sows the seeds of His message, how receptive are my heart and mind? Do I have a hard heart and closed eyes when I read Scripture? Do I read the difficult parts with the same rigor and delight as I do the easier passages? Do I cling to the Jesus who heals and pardons, and shy away from the Jesus who turns over tables and calls out sinners? Do I let the double-edged sword of Scripture do its good, sanctifying work in me? \n\nEugene Peterson wrote it this way in The Message: “They stick their fingers in their ears so they won’t have to listen; They screw their eyes shut so they won’t have to look, so they won’t have to deal with me face-to-face and let me heal them” (Matthew 13:15).\n\nI know my heart is rocky and full of weeds that choke out the Word. The parable of the sower exposes my idols, holding them up to the light of Jesus’ message about the kingdom of God, about the freedom and peace He, and He alone, brings. But I am tempted to fall away when trials come, turning to my own strength instead of the Word of God. I chase the material, the next-best, and the greener grass, instead of running relentlessly after Jesus alone. My faith is weak, even when I long for it to somehow be enough. \n\nThe remedy for my fallow heart is the Word. \n\nThe Apostle Paul tells us that “faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ” (Romans 10:17). May it be so with us. May we be eager listeners with hearts rich with fertile ground, anxious know His teaching, and ready to whatever He asks of us.\n\nMelanie Rainer is a bookworm from birth who makes her days writing, editing, and reading in Nashville, Tennessee.

It’s easy to dismiss them as a much needed encouragement, and little more. The disciples, after all, are frightened. They are stranded in a boat, far from shore, their vessel “buffeted by the waves.” Jesus “goes out to them,” walking across the water, which only stokes their fears more (vv.24-25).\n\nTo calm their anxieties, Jesus says, “It is I,” clarifying who He is. And immediately, Peter recognizes his teacher. \n\nThe climax of the story would seem to come later, when Peter joins Jesus in the waves. But the truth is, this verse is a bombshell. Jesus is making a statement of cosmic proportions, so it’s important not to miss what is happening. \n\nIn these five short words, Jesus is not merely identifying Himself, not in the usual way. This statement is not like announcing yourself at your parents’ back door: “It’s me! Just popping by!” Instead Jesus is making a monumental claim, one that Matthew’s Jewish listeners certainly would have noticed. Jesus is not just identifying Himself as the man they know and love. He is identifying Himself as God.\n\n“It is I”—translated from the Greek words ego eimi, which literally means “I am”—is a clear reference to an Old Testament story. Thousands of years earlier, God identified Himself to Moses in exactly the same way (Exodus 3:14). Theologian Stanley Hauerwas explains, “Just as God names himself to Moses in the burning bush, Jesus identifies himself as ‘I am.’ This is the ‘I am’ of Psalm 77:19, the ‘I am” who provides a way through the sea, a path though the mighty waters.”  \n\nIn other words, Jesus isn’t simply identifying Himself in the midst of the storm; He is identifying His place in human history. Jesus is not just another prophet. He is not just another priest. He is not just another rescuer. He is not just another king. Jesus is no ordinary “good person” who loves God and happens to know a lot about Scripture. Jesus is God Himself, the God who delivered the Israelites and parted the Red Sea. He is the God who is more than able to command the threatening waves below Him.\n\nIt’s an audacious claim, blasphemous even, had it not been true. And it’s a claim that continues to assert its power over our storms today, promising that Jesus is not simply with us, but as God of the universe He is reigning over all creation. We are guaranteed both the intimate presence of the Son, and the almighty authority of the Father. \n\nBoth then and now, we have this comfort and this truth. Jesus is not just our teacher, not just a good example, and not just a friend. Instead He declares, “It is I”:\n\nI am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I am the God of Moses—the God who heard my people cry, and delivered them. I am the God who sees, who knows, and who cares. I am capable and faithful, steady and good. I am not the God who was, or the God who will be; I am the God who is—unchanging, unshakeable, unfailingly compassionate and near.\n\nAnd I, Jesus, have another name: I AM.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 15:1-39, Matthew 16:1-28, Zechariah 12:10, 2 Peter 1:16-18\n\nI am very good at proclaiming things:\n\nI’m going to run a marathon!\n\nI’m going to take music lessons!\n\nI’m going to write one poem a day!\n\nBut these are things that are easier said than done; therefore, I say them, but do not really do them. I ran a half marathon, not a full. I took voice lessons for a few weeks, then quit. I wrote about six poems—over the course of an entire year.\n\nDeclarations are good, but in order to follow through with them we must understand their implications. \n\nIn Matthew 16, Jesus asks His followers, “Who do you say that I am?” And Peter has the right answer: “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God!” he declares (vv. 15-16). \n\nBut just a few verses later, we see that Peter doesn’t fully understand the implications of his declaration. When Jesus explains to His disciples what will eventually happen to Him in Jerusalem, that He will suffer on the cross, Peter is upset. “Oh no, Lord!” he says, “This will never happen to you!” (v. 22). \n\nAs my IVP Bible Background Commentary notes, “Peter had divulged Jesus’ secret identity yet had retained a faulty concept of what that identity entailed.” In other words, it’s one thing to say Jesus is the Messiah; it’s another to understand the implications this has on our lives. \n\nJesus proceeds to very clearly explain what it means to believe He is the Messiah, saying, “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me” (v. 24). Three things: deny yourself, take up your cross, follow Jesus. For those of you who’ve been on this Christian journey for a while, you might be thinking what I’m thinking: Easier said than done. \n\nAll three of these commands are incredibly counterintuitive to our sin nature. “Deny yourself” implies denying your selfish desires, ambitions, and needs. “Take up your cross” implies being prepared for the ridicule and scorn of others, even being prepared for death itself. “Follow me” implies allowing Jesus to be Lord of your life, laying down your control, and giving it to Him. \n\nI can declare that Jesus is the Messiah all day long, but do my actions reflect that I truly believe this? Have I denied myself today? Am I more concerned with what others think than I am with openly being a Christ follower? Am I allowing Jesus to control my life, or am I still gripping the wheel?\n\nBacking up a little in this passage we see that Jesus first asked His disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” (v. 13). He wanted to know what the disciples had observed others were saying about Him. Then He asks, “But you… who do you say that I am?” (v. 15). To me, it feels like the emphasis is on that second question. Jesus is more concerned with who His followers believe Him to be than what other men are saying about Him. \n\nWho we, as Christ followers, proclaim Jesus to be is critical for the world that is looking on. And how we act—much more than what we say—reflects whether or not we believe Jesus is the Messiah. \n\nWe can say and not do, proclaiming Jesus is the Messiah but never denying ourselves, never actually following Him. Or, through the power of Christ in us, we can proclaim and do, showing those around us who Jesus is. Pointing them to Him with our lives. Pointing them to the true Messiah.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 17:1-27, Matthew 18:1-35, 1 Kings 8:10-13, Jeremiah 23:1-4\n\n“Lord,” he said, “have mercy.”\n\nThis was the plea of a father made on behalf of his demon-possessed son. It is a request we have all cried out at one time or another, in different languages and circumstances. In big and small ways, we are constantly asking for mercy from the Lord and from each other. \n\nGive us more time!\n\nHelp us find her!\n\nDon’t lay me down for a nap!\n\n(And as the years pass…) Please, just let me rest!\n\nWhen Jesus healed the demon-possessed boy, His disciples gathered around to understand why they’d been unable to work the miracle themselves. \n\n“Because of your little faith,” he told them. “For truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed… nothing will be impossible for you” (Matthew 17:20).\n\nThe disciples were unable to give this man and his son the mercy they needed because their own faith was so small. While the disciples couldn’t heal the boy or cast out the demon, Jesus could. In fact, earlier in this chapter, the mere radiance of His glory sent them falling to the ground in terror (v. 5). Indeed, Jesus is set apart by His glory.\n\nAlthough there are certainly other times in Scripture when the disciples were able to perform miracles, this case is especially interesting because the man specifically asked for mercy, and the disciples were unable to give it. Later, in chapter 18, Jesus shared the parable of a servant who owes his master a huge sum—a sum so huge that he would need several lifetimes to pay it back. But then that servant turns around and finds somebody who owes him a couple of nickels, and starts choking him to give back his money (vv. 23-28).\n\nAlthough we don’t literally put our hands around the throats of those who owe us something, we do choke others with our lack of mercy and forgiveness. There is a great chasm of difference between God’s mercy and ours, between God’s faithfulness and our faithlessness, between God’s glory and our need. Jesus’ parable forces me to look at the truth: Even when I actually want to be merciful and forgiving, in my own strength, my best efforts prove my ability to forgive is forever lacking.\n\nThe vastness of God’s never-ending mercy shows us our need for forgiveness is enormous. Grasping that need is the first step to understanding the gospel. \n\nIt’s difficult to remember mercy when someone hurts us. Some of us have been hurt so badly it feels like everything is ruined, that nothing can restore what’s been taken from us. The very thought of the offense can fill us with fear and loathing. But we do well to remember this: In order to forgive us, Christ had to die for us. He took the curse that we brought to Him and gave up everything, so He could give us mercy (Galatians 3:13). This is staggering.\n\nTrue forgiveness costs everything. But God loves us so much, He freely gave everything. While this passage does remind us that we are like the unforgiving slave, the bigger truth here is that God is our compassionate Master, and He piles love and forgiveness on us all.\n\nThe gospel is true! God’s great love and mercy for us are greater than all our sins.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 19:1-30, Matthew 20:1-34, Deuteronomy 6:4, 2 Peter 3:10-13\n\nI am very hopeful that my one-day husband’s last name will begin with a letter in the first half of the alphabet. You see, while I love my last name with my whole heart, it begins with a “W,” which means the line for almost anything ends with me.\n\nDuring college graduation, I imagine that my friends whose last names fall at the beginning of the alphabet —Austin, Brock, and Chapman—were all halfway through their family celebration dinners before it was my turn to walk across the stage. I have very big ideas about what it would mean to be first in line.\n\nGetting ahead is the name of the human game. We want nothing more than to be picked first for the kickball team, secure the best seats at the movie theater, win the affection of our coworkers, achieve financial success, and ensure our security and worth at every turn.\n\nSo in Matthew 19, when Jesus says, “Many who are first will be last, and the last first” (v. 30), it may be our first instinct to picture a world where the underdog wins the game of getting ahead—the least athletic kid gets picked first for kickball, and those without savings accounts win the lottery. This is the illustration Jesus gives us, but its main purpose is to point to something even greater: His own measure of success.\n\nGod’s goal isn’t helping us to get ahead—it’s helping us get to Him. His redemption does not work within the constraints of the world’s standards, but within the bounds of eternity.\n\nIn the parable of the vineyard workers in Matthew 20, the workers hired at the beginning of the day are angry by the end of it. They are complaining because the other workers—hired hands just as they were—had done nothing, yet had been made equal to them. None of the workers were underpaid or overworked. Some of them had just experienced “undeserved” kindness, leaving others to feel less superior.\n\nAt least, that’s how it looks from our perspective. But these aren’t just rules and concepts Jesus wants us to unlearn from the ways of the world. Christ is showing us that His kingdom is wholly better. In it, we will be fully loved by Him, forever united. This is the message that all of Jesus’ teachings in these passages point to: unity over divorce, children inheriting the kingdom, poor over rich, last before first. Jesus came to serve the undeserving with kindness; this is the heart of God’s economy.\n\nAs Tim Keller says, “The gospel is this: We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than we ever dared to believe, yet at the very same time we are more loved and accepted in Jesus Christ than we ever dared hope.”\n\nKnowing all our earthly measures are off, let us look to Him, for we are worse and He is better than we could ever guess. May our deepest goal and desire be to find ourselves not first or last, but close to Him. Amen.\n\n",

The hosanna-shouters must have been shocked to see the man on the donkey driving the sellers out of the temple with such authority. “My house will be called a house of prayer,” Jesus said to them. “But you are making it a den of thieves!” (Matthew 21:13).\n\nBut it’s what He did next that was truly radical: He invited the least inside. \n\nThe blind, the lame, the children all came in and Jesus welcomed them, healed them, confirmed their place among Him (vv. 14-15). He cleared out those who had profaned the temple and ushered in those who humbly sought after God. \n\nWhen I picture the scene I can see myself in the wings, on the outside looking in. I am nervous, I am afraid, but I am drawn to this house of God, and so I watch and wait. Those inside seem to have it together, bringing riches rather than sacrifice, doing religion like a business. All I have is this humble offering in my hands, carried the long journey from my home, over rocky roads and mistake-laden miles. \n\nThen I see Him. And right before my eyes I watch Him turn it on its side, all the pretension and injustice and darkness that kept me at bay. He sends out those who’ve come not for God but for gods. \n\nAnd then? He looks me in the eye. Me. Lame, frightened, filthy from days of travel. He looks at me and sees me. He motions for me to come in and then He tells me I belong. \n\nI had cried out “Hosanna! Save me!” not knowing what I was really asking. And He rode on through the streets and into the city, knowing exactly what was coming. He would soon die, but not before He cleansed His house of prayer and invited me in. \n\nThis is our Christ! “The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone” (v. 42). He welcomes in the defenseless, becoming their defense. He brings the weak to Himself and makes them strong. He desires not the shiny sacrifices our pride wishes to bring, but only a heart that is stayed on Him. He saves us when we call out to Him.\n\nOnly He knows what our hearts truly need as we cry out, “Hosanna!” He knew it even then.\n\n \n\n",

Just the other day, I woke to the sound of my phone’s beeping alarm. Ugh. That was my first response. But as my feet hit the ground, something seemed off. Oh, that’s right. It’s Saturday, isn’t it?\n\nIt’s sad but true: I’ve been known to get so caught up in the daily grind that I’ve forgotten about the glory and goodness of the coming weekend. \n\nThe Sadducees didn’t just forget about the good news; they completely denied the possibility of life after death. Anyone remember singing at Vacation Bible School, “I don’t want to be a Sadducee, because they’re so sad you see”? Well, the reason they were “sad” is because their sect of Judaism had no hope for bodily resurrection. The Sadducees wanted to make the idea of the resurrection look ridiculous, and Matthew 22 recounts their attempt to trap the Messiah with a trick question.  \n\nHow did Jesus respond to their attempts at trickery? He lovingly responded to them in their own language, and then offered them a challenge. Because the Sadducees esteemed Moses over all others, Jesus quoted what Moses had to say about the resurrection. When God appeared to Moses in the burning bush, He said, “I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob” (Exodus 3:6). The Lord used the present tense—“I am,” not “I was.” \n\n“He is not the God of the dead, but of the living” (Matthew 22:32). Jesus confirms that Abraham is living, Isaac is living, Jacob is living. There is life after death. Hallelujah!\n\nIt’s easy for us to judge the Sadducees’ unbelief because we have the full and complete gospel in mind. We know that Jesus went down to the grave and rose again. Still, while we might not outright deny the resurrection, do we sometimes forget about it? It’s easy to get so focused on our everyday lives that we lose sight of our heavenly future. We live in fear, cling to earthly security, and fight for status. We may not deny the resurrection with our tongues, but we do with our thoughts and actions. \n\nChrist’s response to the Sadducees is a response for all of us. The Lord understands where you’re coming from and wants to lovingly speak to you about what’s to come. He knows exactly what makes you forget the eternal hope—whether you’re struggling with anxiety, exhausted by caring for children, distracted by work, or any number of other things. He gets it, but He doesn’t leave us there. He gives us true hope. \n\nJesus also challenged the Sadducees to know Scripture better. Could the same be said for us? When we lose sight of the good news, let’s fill our minds with the truth of God’s Word and open our ears to the Lord who speaks to us. May we delve into our Bibles for wisdom from above and hold fast to the living hope of the resurrection.\n\n“Because of his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you.”\n\n– 1 Peter 1:3-4\n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 23:1-39, Exodus 10:21-23, Romans 8:22-23\n\nToday’s passage is a doozy. In Matthew 23, Jesus holds nothing back, saving His harshest, sternest rebuke for two groups. \n\nFirst were the prideful Pharisees, who piled unnecessary burden onto the people. Rather than seeing God’s law as His love, the Pharisees used it as a weapon of position and power. Second were the sidelined scribes. They knew the law, but refused to speak up against the Pharisees’ hypocrisy, and therefore, became a part of the problem themselves. Fearful of the Pharisees’ power, the scribes kept silent, allowing the Pharisees’ perverted message to flourish. They could’ve been a voice for truth, but instead stood by and allowed the Pharisees to abuse the people.  \n\nJesus strongly condemned the Pharisees and scribes—but why?\n\nJesus saw their passion for position. The Pharisees were obsessed with increasing their own authority. They cared a lot about titles, requiring people to call them “Teacher,” “Master,” or “Father,” and racked up converts—not for the benefit of others’ souls, but for the sake of showing the power of their sect. They exalted themselves with false humility, and Jesus saw right through it. \n\nThe Pharisees perverted the Lord’s priorities. They were strict and precise when it came to small matters within the law, while being careless and loose about the things that mattered most. They pointed out small flaws in others while ignoring pervasive sin in their own hearts.\n\nJesus condemned the powerlessness of the Pharisees’ prescriptions. In their position of influence, Pharisees and scribes could have pointed people to deeper relationship with the Lord. Instead, they paved a road that led to destruction.\n\nThe Pharisees were preoccupied with perception. They cared deeply about what other people thought of them, wanting to be followed, trusted, honored, and revered. More concerned with their outward appearance than substance, they dressed to impress. In Deuteronomy, the Lord told His people to impress His commandments on their hearts, to “tie them on your hands and bind them on your foreheads” (6:8). Jews took that literally. During times of prayer, they tied small leather boxes called phylacteries onto their foreheads with Scripture verses hidden inside. The Pharisees made their phylacteries as large as possible, as if to say, “Look at how much Scripture I can carry on my forehead! More than you!”  \n\nBut does it really matter how beautiful you look on the outside, if you’re dying on the inside? Does it matter how beautiful the stone is, when all it marks is a grave?\n\nThe Pharisees were persistent in pride. They allowed themselves to carry on in the sin of their day, while still convinced they would’ve opposed the sins of their fathers. Jesus exposes their hypocrisy and self-deception under the microscope of truth. But the rebukes we hear in Matthew 23 aren’t angry rants—they are woes. Jesus feels deep anguish for the Pharisees and scribes, and for the people they are leading astray, to death. He isn’t smug. He’s not pointing fingers. He’s begging them to see the light. \n\nI imagine Jesus’ heart tearing in two as He speaks to them, longing for them to hear and receive the truth. He knows these are the very men whose hardened hearts will soon cry out, “Crucify!” These men and their pride, their empty passions—they will soon lead Jesus to the cross. \n\nClaire Gibson is a writer whose work has been featured in publications including The Washington Post and Entrepreneur Magazine among many others.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 24:1-51, Matthew 25:1-46, Daniel 7:13-14\n\nRather than organizing our lives into a zillion little categories like family and finances, work and leisure, God’s Word invites us to adopt a new filing system. Everything ultimately fits into one of only two categories: former things, which are destined to pass away, and forever things, which never will. There is no third option. \n\nIn language that feels equal parts inspiring and terrifying, Jesus reminds us to consider forever things here in Matthew 24 and 25. While the gravitational pull of our hearts is to spend our time thinking about the days on our calendar, Christ reminds us that a Day is coming soon that will forever sever our ties to the temporary.\n\n“Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with aloud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one of heaven to the other” (Matthew 24:30-31). \n\nWhen Christ returns a second time, the former things will be no more, and only forever things will remain. It’s a promise so spectacular our hearts can’t seem to absorb it. Jesus knows our tendency is to drop our eyes toward our navels rather than straining them heavenward, waiting for His return. In a parable designed to teach us how to wait well, He compares the Church to ten virgins waiting for their bridegroom. Five came prepared to wait as long as necessary. Five were foolish and did not (Matthew 25:1-12).\n\nJust like Jesus’ disciples who slept instead of standing guard with Him in the garden the night before He died, we are the sleepy virgins, prone to to become weary and distracted as we wait. But our Groom is coming. He’s already on His way. There’s still time to shift our focus away from bills and brokenness and toward our coming King. And while we do not know either the day or the hour, we do know that He’s called us to be alert and ready, waiting for Him with expectant hope of His return (v. 13). \n\nIn Revelation 21 we’re given a glimpse of what life will be like after Jesus rides in on the clouds. Jesus says, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God” (v. 3). Christ is coming back to save the Bride whose ransom He’s already paid. Our long separation from Him will finally come to an end. What then?\n\n“He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away” (v. 4, emphasis mine). Death, mourning, crying, pain—these will all become former things. As Christ teaches about His return, we find that it’s not that temporal things don’t matter, but a time is coming when they won’t. Jesus is coming back for us. On the timeline of eternity, it won’t be long now. May He find us waiting well.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

Judas plays his role, but Christ handed Himself over.\n\nWhat did it look like for Christ to give His life, while He still breathed, as He willingly walked to His death? He gives it away in so many big and small ways in this chapter alone, that I don’t have space here to touch on each. (If you can, take time to circle all the ways you see Christ giving away His life in these verses.) But we can look at a few here together.\n\nWithin the first two verses of the chapter, Jesus tells His disciples the exact day He will die. He specifies that it will happen in two days’ time. We don’t have a record here of their response, but judging from their other responses in Scripture, disbelief is a fair guess. Jesus gives His life by declaring His intention to do so.\n\nHe then allows the woman to prepare His body for burial. He defends her extravagance and celebrates her for seeing a small part of the truth of what would happen to Him, declaring her actions as noble (vv. 6-13). He knows what is coming, yet He doesn’t run from it. Jesus gives His life by preparing for His own burial.\n\nWhile He shares His final meal with the disciples, Jesus distresses His disciples by saying, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me” (v. 21). He suffers one of the deepest human sorrows: betrayal by a friend. In spite of their protestations, His disciples continue to betray Him as they fall asleep (vv. 36-46), desert Him (v. 56), and deny Him (vv. 69-75). Jesus gives His life by suffering betrayal.\n\nIn all these little ways and more, Jesus gave up His life for us. He suffered the whole gamut of human pain from heartbreak to torture. Reading all of this horror would feel gratuitous, except this is the narrative of our own happy ending. Because of Jesus’ thousand tiny deaths, and one literal death, we can live. We not only live, but we get to live happily ever after, with Him. This harrowing history is the key. He slayed the dragon of death and sin, and we can live in grateful joy for His precious sacrifice.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 27:1-66, Matthew 28:1-20, Psalm 22:7-8, 1 Corinthians 15:6, 2 Corinthians 3:18\n\nMy parents like to tell this story about me as a three-year-old.\n\nMy sister and I had a babysitter for the night, and my mom had made us brownies to have as a snack, with the instruction that we were each allowed one brownie. After the first brownie, I reached for a second. \n\n“No, Andrea,” said the babysitter. “You can only have one.” I looked at her, and with a scrunched up face and my hands on my hips, I declared, “You’re not the boss!” At the time, I had a speech impediment that softened my “R”s. So you can imagine how intimidating this sounded to my babysitter.\n\nI still have authority issues. Authority threatens my freedom. It says I am not in charge, not the boss of my own life. Yet, as Christians, we aren’t meant to live under the authority of our own rule. We have a King!\n\nThe Kingship of Jesus is highlighted in Matthew’s account of the crucifixion and resurrection. It was a Roman custom to name the crime of the offender on a plaque and place it above the criminal’s head as He hung on the cross. Because Pilate said Jesus had committed no real crime, he ordered this inscription instead:\n\n“This is Jesus, the King of the Jews” (Matthew 27:37).\n\nIt was a label given in contempt that could not have been more correct. \n\nScripture tells us Jesus is not only King of the Jews, but He is the King. As Revelation 19:16 says, “he has a name written on his robe on his thigh: King of Kings and LORD of Lords.” Still, I more often refer to Jesus as my Savior rather than my King. Charles Spurgeon says this is our tendency: “Men might be willing for Christ to save them, but not for Him to reign over them.”\n\nAcknowledging that Jesus reigns over me means acknowledging that I am not in control. But His kingship also means He is involved in the everyday—that His sovereignty covers even the nitty gritty of life. There is accountability that says we are called to a new, gospel way of living, and there is grace that says we aren’t doing this on our own. Both threaten our autonomy. \n\nSo we have to ask ourselves: Who’s the boss here? Me or Jesus?\n\nWhen we bow to Jesus as our King, we receive what we are most afraid of losing in the face of authority: freedom. Real freedom. \n\n“So if the Son sets you free, you really will be free” (John 8:36). \n\nThat’s the type of freedom I want. Not the kind that creates the illusion of my own control, but the kind that comes with the cross. The kind that comes with surrendering to the power that conquered death forever and rose victorious from the grave. \n\nThis is Jesus. He is the Son of God, the King of the Jews, the Savior of the world—and He is also the King of me. \n\nThe angel told the women, “Don’t be afraid, because I know you are looking for Jesus who was crucified. He is not here. For he has risen, just as he said.”\n\nMatthew 28:5-6\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nText: Mark 1, Nahum 1:15, Malachi 3:1\n\nI sometimes study best with a pen in hand. \n\nThere’s probably some scientific reason to explain the powerful connection between our hands and head as they interact with the same thing—or maybe I just made that up. Either way, it totally works for me. When I really want to learn something, I use a pen to help me make a visual map of the text I’m reading. The book of Mark calls for pen-in-hand reading; there’s a lot going on and it all happens very quickly.\n\nThe apostle Luke spends the first two chapters of his Gospel beautifully telling the story of the expectation and arrival of the baby Jesus. Matthew walks us through one long (and super important!) genealogy of Christ before any real narrative begins. And John takes time to establish Jesus as the Word who was with God and is God. All wonderful stuff, critical to the canon.\n\nMark, on the other hand, hits the ground running. And really, he never stops. Heavy on directional language and light on details, the first chapter alone includes at least ten significant plot points, all connected with words like “immediately” and “right away,” as we whiplash into yet another important scene. (You know I marked every one of them with my trusty pen. Pun intended.)\n\nNow, I’m not accusing Mark of writing like he’s running out of time, but there is an efficiency to his message that tells me there’s no time to spare. The gospel is urgent, and there is much Mark wants his readers to know about the Christ he loves and follows.\n\nStill, amid the rapid-fire storyline of the first chapter of Mark, the moments of stillness have a way of standing out. (And yes, I marked these too.) Juxtaposing all the noisy action on the page, Jesus retreats to the wilderness (v. 12), silences an unclean spirit (v. 25), does not permit the demons to speak (v. 34), goes away to a deserted place to pray (v. 35), tells the healed man to keep quiet (v. 43), and ultimately begins preaching in deserted places (v. 45). This many instances of quiet become too loud to ignore on a page with so much activity.\n\nMark doesn’t waste any extra words saying what he wants us to know. From the very first line, he gets straight to the point: Jesus is “the Son of God” (v. 1). Later, God Himself addresses Jesus as His “beloved Son” (v. 11), and even the unclean spirit says to Jesus, “I know who You are—the Holy One of God!” (v. 24). According to Mark’s Gospel, Jesus’ divinity is non-negotiable. \n\nYou can see why the book of Mark appeals to me as a student of the Word. But that doesn’t keep it from being tender to my heart as well. “This is why I have come,” Jesus tells His disciples (v. 38). Not to be flashy, not to draw big crowds, but to preach the gospel with a contagious holiness that could drive out demons and heal the unclean. Yes, there is a lot of action, but the message is simple, spoken from the lips of Christ Himself: “Repent and believe in the good news!” (v.15).\n\nAs we embark on this journey into another exciting book of the Bible, let’s take out our pens, connecting our hands to our heads. Let’s pay attention to the inspired, intentional way this very unique book was written. But let’s not forget to also lay our pens down and engage our hearts, remembering Christ’s simple call to “repent and believe” that the gospel is true—that it is good news, and it is for all of us.\n\n",

I’m not a fan of being the patient. \n\nI can always find a reason to avoid a visit. I’ll let an ailment linger for days, aiming to kick it with a home remedy or just some good ol’ fashioned pain tolerance. But a couple years ago, while living in downtown Manhattan, I couldn’t shake or will away an overwhelming, inexplicable illness. After writhing in pain for three days straight, common sense kicked in; I hailed a cab at midnight and headed to urgent care.\n\nDesperation will do this, when denial inevitably falls short.  \n\nThey gave me something to ease the immediate pain, and insisted I visit my primary care physician the next morning. We ran labs for three days and found that all my levels were off. I could barely walk, barely eat. I was coming off a season of constant adrenaline, and when the pace finally slowed, my body followed suit. I learned the hard way that forty years old is not equal to twenty. My top priority would become rest in order to give my body the healing it required.\n\nWhen I read the story of the paralytic in Mark, I’m struck by the desperation of his friends to see him healed. Perhaps he had suffered a lifetime of loss and missed opportunity. And since there was no taxi to be found at midnight, they simply needed to find a way to get him in front of the Great Physician.\n\nThere’s a crowd in the way? No matter. There’s a roof in the way? No matter. Nothing deterred them from getting the help they were seeking. Their faith in Jesus’ power to heal enabled them to break through any barrier—literally. \n\nTheir tenacity moved Jesus. Scripture says when He saw their persistent faith, He uttered, “Son, your sins are forgiven!” (Mark 2:5). Jesus started with the inner healing of the heart, but didn’t stop there. He then commanded the man to get up and walk so the resistant religious leaders could see He had the authority of God to not only heal bodies, but also to forgive sins. \n\nWe want the external; Jesus goes after the internal.\n\nWe want what is seen; Jesus goes after what is unseen.\n\nDid He want the man to walk? Absolutely. Did He go after the healing of his heart? Fundamentally. \n\nThe nature of Jesus never changes. He always heals, always redeems, always restores. Our role is to come. When we reach our moment of desperate brokenness, no longer denying our sickness of heart and mind, we will do whatever it takes to get well. There we will behold His face, hear His voice, and receive His healing touch. \n\nThat’s the gospel, simple and plain. Jesus said, “Those who are well don’t need a doctor, but the sick do need one. I didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners” (Mark 2:17). \n\nI want to be among the ones who know they are sinners—broken, weary, in desperate need of a Savior. I want to experience a break-through-the-rooftop kind of healing. I pray the Holy Spirit will convict me, moment by moment, again and again. His conviction is a grace, a kindness, and a revelation that all is not well. But the healing we need is found in the forgiveness of our Savior, Jesus.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Mark 4:1-41, Amos 4:13\n\nMy childhood house is on the market. (It still feels weird to say it.) On my favorite mountain, yes. On the street lined with elm trees, certainly. On school bus 24’s route, always. But on the market—for sale, like a cup of lemonade from the neighbor’s kid? No, thank you. \n\nThis is probably why homeowners aren’t invited to the Open House. It would just be too hard to let go. Still, I can’t help but want to give prospective buyers some helpful hints as to how to live in the house. Perhaps, I’d offer them a sticky note tour.\n\nWelcome to our—er, potentially your—new home! I’d write. Don’t worry about taking off your shoes; the puppy’s ruined the carpet already anyway. \n\nHere’s where we keep the plates. Silverware can be found in the drawer on the left, and the trash can’s under the sink. \n\nMy dad stoned in that fireplace the summer before I started high school, and my mom made the quilt draped over the couch the summer I graduated college.\n\nMake sure you leave this door open for the cat, and help yourself to snacks. (I hide the chocolate in the top right cabinet.) Keep the front door closed so you don’t let the raccoons in! (I’m serious.) \n\nIt’s then that I realize what I’ve tried so hard to forget: the house they’ll be moving into won’t have snacks or cats or hand-me-down china or my mother’s quilts. They won’t be joining my family in the house. After we move out, the sticky notes won’t make any sense. \n\nInitially, some of Jesus’ parables don’t make much sense either. As He talks about sowing and mustard seeds, I imagine the onlookers wondering how in the world any of it applied to faith. So, why did Jesus tell parables? Was He making His lessons easier to comprehend? Was He avoiding complicated theology? No, Jesus was actually choosing to not let them understand.\n\n“To those outside, everything comes in parables so that they may look and look, yet not perceive; they may listen and listen, yet not understand; otherwise, they might turn back—and be forgiven.”\n\n—Mark 4:11-12\n\nJesus’ instructions were meant for those living in His house—His Father’s house, the Kingdom of God. The secret of the Kingdom God isn’t a story or an equation, but a person. And a story without Him, the main character, isn’t a story, but a parable. \n\nWhen listeners don’t see Jesus as the entrance to the Kingdom, or are out to manipulate His words, He creates a fence around His house by telling a parable. Jesus proves that you don’t arrive at the Truth by becoming smarter, wealthier, or more important; you find Truth by following Him to His house! \n\nAs for His disciples, Christ never leaves them hanging. He’s always willing to explain the parables when asked and reassure them with Truth. Privately, He would explain everything to them (Mark 4:10). The Harvest has come. It is Me. I am here. Do not fear. \n\nAs Christ’s followers, we get to live in that house with a protective fence and no need for sticky notes because we have His Word, filled with all we’ll ever need know. Thanks be to God! \n\n“He is here: the One who forms the mountains, creates the wind, and reveals His thoughts to man, the One who makes the dawn out of darkness and strides on the heights of the earth.\n\nYahweh, the God of Hosts, is His name.”\n\n—Amos 4:13\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Mark 5:1-43, Acts 9:39-41\n\nThe sheer magnitude of Christ’s sovereignty is a general theme of Mark chapter five. He is a really big God! The “Giant Jesus” motif of Mark’s gospel account actually begins at the end of chapter four, where the Good Shepherd proves He’s large and in charge. In the middle of a storm, He stands up in a rocky boat on the Sea of Galilee to calm the seas with this concise command: Peace. Be Still. With those three little words He confirms His complete authority over the natural world. \n\nAt the beginning of chapter five, Jesus demonstrates His supremacy over the supernatural world (Mark 5:1-13), and then goes on to prove His Lordship over death (Mark 5:35-43). But in my opinion, the best part of this passage is a story-within-a-story, which illustrates not only the incomparable power of Jesus, but also the tenderness of our big God (Mark 5:21-34).\n\nThe woman isn’t named, but she is framed by the symptom of her malady—blood—which was a gross violation of Jewish propriety (Leviticus 15:19-33). If you had an open wound or obvious hemorrhage, you were barred from communal activity, including worship. Much like a leper, this bleeding woman was considered ceremonially ”unclean.” She certainly wasn’t supposed to be in a public setting potentially contaminating her “clean” neighbors. \n\nBut she was so desperate for relief from her suffering that she chose to risk weaving her way through the crowd in hopes of touching the edge, or even just the tassels, of Jesus’ robe (Matthew 9 depicts this same story with that particular detail). \n\nHer trembling alone might have alerted Jesus to her presence (Mark 5:33). I imagine her there, breathing fast and hiding behind her veil, scared someone in the crowd would expose her for trampling on Torah rules, inciting a stern rebuke from the local priest, if not a stoning by the whole community.\n\nYet our compassionate Redeemer doesn’t reprimand her for breaking the law. Instead He leans in and listens to her whole story. Can you imagine how long it took her to explain the 12-year saga of losing her health, wealth, relationships, and reputation? \n\nAnd don’t forget the context here: Jesus is on His way to the home of a prominent local leader to attend to his dying daughter—a medical emergency, presumably one with priority. Besides, this woman’s already been healed physically. She’s had her turn, so to speak. It would’ve been completely understandable if Jesus had just kept on walking toward the gated community where Jairus lived. But He didn’t; instead, He stopped and gave His complete attention to a seemingly insignificant fringe-grabber.  \n\nOne of my favorite living authors is a lovely, humble pastor named Max Lucado. I’ve had the joy of getting to spend a little time with Max and his family over the past fifteen years, but prior to the privilege of meeting them personally, a friend shared a heart-warming observation she made while at a large gathering in their home. \n\nOne of the Lucado girls, who was six or seven at the time, idled over to the piano to play a simple tune she’d recently learned. When Max heard the first note, he politely excused himself from a serious conversation with several important publishing executives. Then he walked over, leaned against the wall next to the piano, and watched her play with obvious affection. He made his little girl feel like the most important person in the room that night. And she was—to her daddy, anyway.\n\nMark chapter five reminds us that while Jesus is the King of all kings, He’s also a perfectly personal Savior who delights in listening to His kids play Chopsticks. The beyond-colossal Ruler of the universe bends down to prove He’s absolutely crazy about you and me. \n\nLisa Harper is a master storyteller with a masters of Theological Studies from Covenant Seminary. She’s lauded as an engaging, hilarious communicator as well as an authentic and substantive Bible teacher. She’s been in vocational ministry for 30 years and has written 15 books and Bible study curriculums but says her greatest accomplishment by far is that of becoming Missy’s (her adopted daughter from Haiti) mama! They live on a hilly farmette south of Nashville, Tennessee, where they enjoy eating copious amounts of chips, queso, and guacamole.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Mark 6:1-56, 2 Kings 2:11\n\nWhen Jesus invited His disciples to steal away, sit, and stop for a while, you can imagine how readily they took Him up on the offer. In a world where a young girl can ask for the head of a prophet on a platter, and see the king swiftly grant her wish for fear of looking like a fool (Matthew 6:24-26), Jesus’ followers must have wondered what they’d gotten themselves into. But they’d seen the Son of God in all His glory, healing and saving and bringing dead people back to life. They’d witnessed with their own eyes that He was who the prophet said He was. They believed! Most of the time.\n\nLife as one of the Twelve was certainly eventful. Some passages in Mark’s Gospel make it sound nothing short of chaotic. “Many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat,” Mark writes (v. 30). Sound familiar? The chaos swirls and the demands of the day rise like waves, ready to wipe out all our best intentions. But Jesus says, Come away. Find the quiet. Rest a while.\n\nThe disciples tried, but chaos followed. Jesus and the Twelve got into boats and sailed off “to a remote place” (v. 32). But someone caught sight of them and word spread, and there was a crowd waiting for them when they reached the shore.\n\nJesus, being the compassionate Son of God, got out of the boat and taught the people, right there at the edge of the shore, and kept teaching well into the night (v. 34). The disciples, naturally, got antsy. Send them away, they said. They must be hungry for dinner, they said. \n\nYou’re right, He said, You feed them. And when the disciples looked at Him like He was crazy, He gently nudged them forward to faith. He nudged them to believe.\n\nFeed them what? they asked. After all, He’d told them to bring nothing with them (v. 8). All they had was a few loaves and fishes… and Him.\n\nIt’s Me, you guys. Believe.\n\nAfter that miraculous feast, Jesus sent the disciples ahead again by boat, but chaos still followed—this time in the form of wind and waves. Jesus walked to them, holy feet on top of the water, and they cried out in fear at the sight. “Have courage!” He said. “Don’t be afraid” (v. 50).\n\nIt’s Me, you guys. Believe.\n\nAnd this would be the pattern. Where Jesus and the disciples went, a bluster of activity followed. People rushed through the streets to find Him, carrying the sick and ailing around on mats, hoping just to brush against the robe of the One who could heal. “And everyone who touched it was made well” (v. 56).\n\nThe Twelve saw it all; they were standing right there. Still, they struggled to believe. Still, Jesus had to constantly remind them that He was who He said He was.\n\nIt’s Me, you guys. Believe.\n\nWe’ve seen it, too, you know. Many of us have seen Jesus up close, in our lives and in His Word. We’ve seen Him change hearts and heal sickness and bring hope to the dark. And still, here in the chaos, we struggle to believe. \n\nBut the Son of God stands and calls to us, just as He called to the Twelve. He calls us to come away and rest for awhile, to remember He is who He says He is. Yes, we are weak and weary, but we are invited to stay near the very Son of God. We can rest in the knowledge that He still has the power to feed and calm and heal.\n\nIt really is Him, friends. We can believe. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Mark 7:1-37, Jeremiah 17:9-10, Hebrews 8:6-7,10\n\nThe heart is glorified in our culture. We sing songs about it. We talk about following it, as if it were a wise guide. We paint it onto greeting cards in February—beautiful, pink, and symmetrical. Can you imagine what a greeting card heart would look like if it were painted after the heart we read about in Mark 7? \n\nMaybe one side of it would be pretty and pink, but the other side? Scraggly, grey, ugly. A lopsided, scary-looking heart wouldn’t help greeting card sales, I know, but it would better match the heart Jesus talks about in this passage. He says that from our hearts come “evil thoughts, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders, adulteries, greed, evil actions, deceit, promiscuity, stinginess, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness” (Mark 7:21-22).\n\nThese evils are not caused by some outside force. They originate from within us (Mark 7:23). Nothing like being told your heart is the root of greed and evil actions to get your day going, right? But if we can sit with this truth for a little while, something very beautiful is revealed.\n\nI remember hearing my mom compliment her friend one time on how nice she looked. Her hair was fixed. She had on a new sweater. Her make-up was perfection. She looked lovely. \n\n“Thanks,” the friend said. “My mom always taught me that if you’re having a bad day, you can at least put on a cute outfit.”\n\nIsn’t this our natural response? To pull ourselves together from the outside in? We scrub our exterior as much as we can, hoping to fix what’s dirty and broken on the inside. This might look like a new outfit, or volunteering at church, or making sure you’re seen with the right crowd. None of those things are inherently wrong or bad, but when we do them in an attempt to heal something that feels broken, or to earn the approval of our Father, they begin to reflect what the Pharisees were doing: fixating on the law and rituals.\n\nJesus had something to say about these attempts of ours: “These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. They worship Me in vain” (Mark 7:6-7). Our rituals and outward behavior will not bring us into true communion with Christ because those things are not His primary concern. He is concerned with our hearts. He sees straight through the exterior into the real—into the dark, the grey, and the ugly.\n\nAnd here’s the beautiful part: Jesus chose to live right there, in our hearts, and to write the law under this new covenant. “I will put My laws into their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be My people” (Hebrews 8:10). \n\nThis is what makes the whole gospel thing such a life-changer. We don’t have to scrub ourselves clean. The blood of Christ has already done that.  \n\nIt’s all too easy for me to slide back into Pharisee mode, to put on a cute outfit and hope for the best. But Pharisee mode prevents true communion with Christ. Let’s not offer Him our perfectly-symmetrical-greeting-card hearts today. Let’s offer Him our real hearts and, in return, experience real worship.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText:  Mark 8:1-38, Mark 9:1, 2 Samuel 7:14-16, Daniel 7:13-14\n\nI love reading the book of Mark because he makes no apologies for Jesus’ seemingly oddball behavior. To bystanders, His acts might’ve seemed whacky or even alien—like He’s not from this world. You can see this so clearly in Mark chapter 8. \n\nAfter Jesus miraculously fed 4,000 people in the middle of nowhere and with next to nothing (Mark 8:17), He and His disciples boarded a boat. That’s where the disciples quickly realized they’d forgotten something essential: food. Somebody forgot the food!\n\nWhat follows might be one of the saddest statements recorded in the gospels. “Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: ‘Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?’” (Mark 8:17).\n\nHis statement was filled with great sorrow, not because the disciples were thick-headed, but because they were so deeply entrenched in the ways of this world that they still couldn’t trust the promises of heaven. Jesus wanted them to see that He is not bound by the limitations of the physical world, so neither were they. \n\nThe Son of God did not follow the rules of the world. Unconcerned about fame, He told those He’d healed to not to say a word (Mark 8:25). When His disciples professed their belief that He is the Messiah, Jesus told them to keep it under wraps (Mark 4:10-12). Jesus did the opposite of what someone trying to gather a following would do, because His fame was not bound to this earth.\n\nBut Peter desperately wanted Jesus to stay here on this earth. They were healing people, feeding people, changing lives! So when Jesus began to explain that He was preparing to die, it was no surprise that Peter told Him to stop talking such nonsense. After all, Jesus was only in His thirties. Death was a long way off. Wasn’t it?\n\nJesus’ words were a loving warning: “You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns” (Mark 8:33).\n\nWhat are your concerns today? Are you hungry? Are you deeply desiring a change in your life? Are you desperate for peace? Are you confused about which job to take, what city to move to, or how to discipline that child who just seems to laugh at you when you put her in time out? These are valid concerns. They are real. But they are temporary. \n\nLosing our life—picking up our cross to follow Him—doesn’t necessarily mean suffering death by political execution. As Christians, everyday life is our cross. We are called to live with God’s concerns at the forefront of our minds, even as the world is screaming its empty promises at us. \n\nJesus is calling us to believe that He is fighting for us while we are silent, while we are still (Exodus 14:14). He is inviting us to be whacky like Him—to be of another world altogether. Like our Messiah, we can hold loosely to this temporary life because we know there is another, more brilliant Kingdom that is our home. \n\nHis dominion is an everlasting dominion\n\nthat will not pass away,\n\nand His kingdom is one\n\nthat will not be destroyed.\n\n– Daniel 7:14\n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Mark 9:2-50, Philippians 1:15-18\n\nI love to get down to business. If we are in a swimming pool, I can’t handle any of that standing and splashing around nonsense. I’d rather accomplish something and swim. If I have something important to tell you, I’ll rush it every time, forgetting to shoot the breeze first. I just love to keep things moving along and attend to the business at hand.\n\nWhen Peter suddenly finds himself face to face with Jesus, Moses, and Elijah transfigured, he immediately switches on his “Let’s do something!” response. Just look at his reaction. He doesn’t know what to do or say, so he scrambles and offers to build a tabernacle. Never mind that he doesn’t have tools or supplies. He sees God incarnate and his natural response is,  “Let’s build a place to honor—and maybe hide—some of this awful glory.”\n\nJust like Peter, when I think of how to interact with the glory of God, I want to rush to fix things, to hurry and set up the proper structure for Him. I’m inclined to scramble when faced with His glory, because I’m usually only focused on my own role instead of His.\n\nWhen Jesus appears transfigured with Moses and Elijah, one of the many things He’s proving is that He is His Father’s Man. He stands illuminated with Moses, a symbol of the Law, and Elijah, a symbol of the prophets, and shows us that He is the literal embodiment of both. But Jesus is not just some symbolic fulfillment; His actual person fulfills the words of the prophets and the strictures of the Law (Matthew 5:17). He is doing His Father’s will, and it is blindingly glorious.\n\nIn the face of this shining glory we find Peter. He was chosen by Christ to be the rock of the church (Matthew 16:18)—he’s a big deal among the disciples. But Peter was still trying to figure out what it really meant for Jesus to be who He is. I imagine it’s hard to see all the might and power of the universe sitting on the shoulders of a teacher and friend. On the Mount of Transfiguration, Peter is trying his best to work it all out. But his best is still human understanding, and when it comes to the infinite, there’s a point where we just have to acknowledge our limitations.\n\nWhen we glimpse the glory of God, we’re often like Peter: ready to go build tabernacles (or whatever seems right for the moment) and get started right away. But God speaks and gently redirects us, saying, “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!” (Mark 9:7). \n\nLater, when Jesus heals the sick child, the response of the boy’s father is beautiful, yet simple: I do believe, but help me to understand (Mark 9:24, my paraphrase). Peter’s response could have been the same as that grieving father’s: Jesus! I believe. Help me to understand!\n\nIt’s not about me. It’s not about my belief or my ability to solve problems quickly. It’s about Christ revealed. God’s own glory is the centerpiece, not any human notion. \n\nFather, give us eyes to see as You see.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Mark 10:1-52, Isaiah 51:17, 1 Peter 4:13\n\nI’ll never forget the day Larry broke his neck. Wedged between cardboard boxes and covered in bubble wrap, my beloved rocking horse sat in the corner of a moving truck that would take him to my family’s new house, states away. \n\nMy dad dreamed up Larry shortly after I was born. He carefully calculated each detail, making sure it was short enough for my little-girl stature, wide enough to fill the empty corner of my bedroom, and colorful enough to make me cheer with delight. His creation was the perfect combination of mint green, pastel yellow, flowered harness, rope hair, and toddler joy. \n\nBut one sharp turn and a loud “crack!” later, Larry toppled into the truck’s side, breaking in two. I can only imagine the nightmares the poor truck driver probably still has after coming between a little girl and her rocking horse. \n\nAs I’ve become more aware of brokenness, I’ve realized it doesn’t always make a loud “crack!” As people fractured since the Fall, do we even notice the cracks? It’s easier to classify some things as broken: adultery, sickness, murder. But I’m slow to remember their opposites—marriage, wellness, friendship—are cracked too. Even our best is broken. \n\nC.S. Lewis reminds us that even our joy is broken:\n\n“We are half-hearted creatures, fooling around with drink\n\nand sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us,\n\nlike an ignorant child who wants to go on making\n\nmud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what\n\nis meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are\n\nfar too easily pleased.”\n\nFar too easily pleased. Friends, this doesn’t mean we’re low-maintenance children of God. Rather, we are refusing to believe God is the supreme good. \n\nIn Mark 10, the crowds are asking Jesus questions about the Kingdom of God, each one revealing their half-heartedness; they want His approval on matters of divorce, salvation, and money. God never approves brokenness, but He does send someone to heal it. How easily we forget this truth. Even our memories are cracked!\n\nWe are adulterers; He remains committed to us.\n\nWe want possessions; He calls us His.\n\nWe are broken; He is whole.\n\nThe crowd asks pointed questions as they pick up the earthly, broken pieces to see where they belong in the big puzzle of the Kingdom of God. In each of His responses, we see Jesus point to God’s divine creation (v. 6), joining together (v. 9), covenant promise (v. 39), and sacred union (v. 39). Jesus mends even the brokenness we cannot see. \n\nAlthough Larry’s neck is now held together by Super Glue®, I love him the same way I did right after the final coat of paint was finished and I could behold my dad’s complete and perfect work.\n\nDespite our false notions and obvious cracks, Jesus looks at us the same way, remembering His Father’s creation and perfect union. “Come, follow me,” He says (v. 21). Like the healed blind man who can now see, may we follow Him on the road to His Kingdom. Amen. \n\nWake yourself, wake yourself up!\n\nStand up, Jerusalem,\n\nyou who have drunk the cup of His fury\n\nfrom the hand of the Lord;\n\nyou who have drunk the goblet to the dregs—\n\nthe cup that causes people to stagger.\n\n—Isaiah 51:17\n\n \n\n",

One minute, there were four people in the room, and the next minute, there were five. The baby who was theoretically growing in my belly for nine months was an actual human being—he was here! He looked nothing like I’d expected, and his birth didn’t go anything like I’d planned, but he was here. I was shocked by how immediately I felt like a mother; the pride and protective instincts I felt for my child caught me off guard. The whole experience can only be described as astonishing. Unexpected, yet wonderful.\n\nFast forward six years. My baby boy was a kindergarten rock star, but one man hundreds of miles away made me feel fear like I’d never known. I was at the grocery store not far from my son’s school when I heard the news that Sandy Hook Elementary had been attacked by a gunman. Boys and girls my own child’s age were terrorized, injured, even killed.\n\nI’ll never forget counting the minutes until my little boy’s eyes met mine as he pounced, carefree, off his yellow school bus. He was fine, but I was not. I was not astonished that day; I was afraid. I wept into the night, praying for protection for my own son, and comfort for the mothers and fathers and children in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, whose lives would never be the same. \n\nAstonished and afraid. There’s a big difference, isn’t there? When I read Mark 11, I notice both of these reactions to Jesus upon His arrival in Jerusalem. Some were astonished and others were afraid.\n\nIn verse 18, just after Jesus overturned the tables and chairs in the temple, Scripture says the chief priests began “looking for a way to destroy Him. For they were afraid of Him.” But the crowd? In that very same moment, they were “astonished by His teaching.”\n\nLater, in verses 30-32, the chief priests weren’t able to give an answer to Jesus’ question about John’s baptism. Why? Because “they were afraid of the crowd.”\n\nThis dichotomy appears often in Jesus’ ministry—the crowds are astonished and the religious leaders are almost always afraid. In Mark 1:11, when Jesus cleansed a man of an unclean spirit, Scripture says the crowd was “astonished at His teaching because, unlike the scribes, He was teaching them as one having authority.”  \n\nThis dichotomy of astonishment and fear appears in our lives, too. We’re astonished at the skill of Olympic athletes, and we are afraid of heights. We are astonished by double rainbows, and we are afraid of loud thunderstorms. As we read the reactions of those who received Jesus’ authority and those who hoped to explain it away, I wonder, How do I react when I encounter Jesus’ authority in my own life? \n\nDoes it make me afraid? Does it compel me to hold tight to the things I love, lest He shake up my plans?  \n\nOr do I feel astonished at His power, the same way I was astonished at the wonder of meeting my baby boy? Am I surprised and delighted by the way Jesus works in ways I do not expect?\n\nAs we read the book of Mark today, let’s notice the authority with which Jesus rides into Jerusalem like the King that He is, how He surveyed the temple quietly in verse 11, then commanded the fig tree to wither in verse 14. Let’s watch the “unexpected, yet wonderful” way Jesus cleanses His Father’s house and answers the chief priests as they attempt to usurp Him. \n\nBecause Jesus is our King, and He is God’s Son, His authority doesn’t have to make us afraid. We can simply watch, astonished by the King of Kings, who has all authority in heaven and on earth!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Mark 12:1-44, Isaiah 5:1-5, 1 Peter 2:4-8\n\nMany of us have heard the parable of the tenants found in Mark chapter 12. The owner of a vineyard leases it to careless tenants who eventually kill his son in order to keep the spoils for themselves. It’s about God’s chosen people, the Israelites, the ones who thought the work of salvation would take gusto and bravado, laws and legalities. \n\nBut they forgot who owned the vineyard, the grapes, and the wine, and that He’d only allotted it all to them for a time. Then one day He took it back and gave it to the entire world: to the Gentiles, Samaritans, Romans—the ends of the earth—and now to you and me. \n\nSometimes I find myself still tending to the vineyards and missing out on the feast He’s preparing (Isaiah 25:6). I swat at the people He sends my way, kill the inklings of hope in His name, and fight off those coming my way only to serve. \n\nI try to sacrifice Christ again and again with my sore attempts at gaining my own righteousness. I try to produce prize fruit on the merit of my own labors. Because when I laid my crowns at the feet of Jesus, I certainly expected to pick them back up somewhere along the way.\n\nPaul warns Christians that, to be in relationship with Jesus, we’d actually have to fellowship in His sufferings, becoming like Him in His death (Philippians 3:10). I must not have understood this because I most definitely did not expect to be so trampled down (Isaiah 5:1-5).\n\nI am the irresponsible tenant and the wild, overgrown grapes. I have mistreated my Father’s things and I have grown wild in going my own way. I have turned away from His feast, certain I can prepare and keep a better one. I have not submitted to His pruning, certain I can handle the shears on my own. But the ruined vineyard and the irresponsible tenants are no match for the Vinedresser.  \n\nHe clears the field again, gathers those stones again, and sets in its corner a Stone greater than all the other stones (Mark 12:10). He resurrects it again—stone by stone by living stone—building it all together into a temple for the Holy Spirit, leveling it on the ground of His Son, solid and firm (1 Peter 2:4-8). And the vineyards within bear fruit in abundance—the work of the Holy Spirit, the Vinedresser, and the Son in unison with one another. \n\nThis is the work of fruitful farming in the field of faith: to know He will send friend after friend to help guide us back to the right path. He will trample to death that which doesn’t bear fruit and He will even prune what’s good to make it healthier—and sometimes we won’t know the difference. This is the work of faith, to believe and to tend, to submit and to bear fruit. But it’s all done under the watchful, caring eye of the Vinedresser, within the safe haven of the living stones, and on the bedrock of the Cornerstone, Christ alone.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

(NO TEXTING AND DRIVING!) It’s a map app that updates in real time when there are accidents or other hazards on the road. It even updates for speed traps. \n\nA few months ago, as I was driving back home to Nashville, the app sounded its alert. There had been a major accident forty or so miles ahead, meaning my trip would be extended by thirty minutes.\n\nI appreciated the alert, but didn’t love the news. \n\nWithin a few miles, the app beeped at me again with a new route. I was supposed to get off the interstate at the next exit and weave through backwoods Tennessee for thirty miles. I’d never been that way before, and I had no idea where I was going; but the app did, and that was enough for me. \n\nAfter doing the bob and weave down two-lane country roads, I began to run parallel to the interstate and could see it backed up for miles and miles. Cars were stopped dead in their lanes, and drivers were out walking among them as the highway was now completely shut down. Now traveling in a steady stream of moving cars tracing the back roads, I wondered if they all had the same app and directions as me. Soon our caravan of strangers got back on the interstate right past the overturned tractor trailer, giving us a clear path back to Nashville.\n\nI felt sorry for the people stuck in the traffic. They had no idea what was coming when they were casually driving up I-24. And while it wouldn’t have changed the situation (that poor, unfortunate tractor trailer strewn across four lanes of traffic), it sure would have changed their response to it!\n\nThat traffic app is kind, in a weird way. It sees what I can’t see, warns me of things I want to avoid. It makes me feel safer to have the information.\n\nMaybe that’s what Jesus was doing on the hilltop overlooking Jerusalem. He chose to protect and care for the disciples—and us—through very hard times, by warning us that they were on the way (Mark 13:5-8). \n\nEvery building will fall apart?\n\nWars and rumors of wars?\n\nKingdom against kingdom?\n\nIt sounds scary and dangerous and altogether bad. This could not have been the disciples’ favorite conversation they’d ever had with Jesus. But what might sound harsh and frightening is really an act of Jesus’ love and protection. \n\nDo these warnings ever terrify me? WELL, SURE. But they are not meant to bring fear or worry. They are Jesus’ kindness to us. He sees what we cannot see, and sprinkles in a new set of directions throughout the text. “Be on your guard,” He tells us. “I have told you everything ahead of time” (Mark 13:23). And for that, we should be so grateful. \n\nWe can trust Jesus, no matter what is coming around the bend. We may not avoid pain and suffering along the way, but He promises we will see Him in the midst of it—because He’s already there.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Mark 14:1-72, Isaiah 53:2-3\n\nWaste not, want not. Right?\n\nWhen the woman at Bethany cracked the expensive jar of oil and poured it over Jesus’ head, her relatives flared their nostrils and demanded, “Why has this fragrant oil been wasted?” It seemed like a good question because the jug of oil was worth 300 denarii (Mark 14:4-5). Considering a day’s wages in Palestine at that time was one denarius (Matthew 20:2), this woman poured out a year’s wages on Jesus’ head, and all she had to show for it was oily hands.\n\nBut Jesus wiped His eyes and celebrated her gift, announcing that she had anointed His body in advance for burial. Indeed, in this chapter, the longest in the Gospel of Mark, we see Jesus in the center of several kinds of preparation as He walked through the days that led Him inexorably to the cross. \n\nThe preparations began with a plot to kill Jesus (v. 1), followed by the parenthetical anointing to prepare His body (v. 8). This led to the disciples’ preparation for Passover (v. 12) and concluded with Jesus’ prediction of betrayal (v. 18). And in the middle of all this preparation and betrayal, Jesus stopped and instituted the Lord’s Supper. He was preparing them for life without Him. \n\nIt makes sense that this indelible sacrament—one of His dearest gifts to us—was given as He was surrounded by betrayal on one side and suffering on the other. But the gospel is only realized in suffering. In fact, there is no gospel apart from Christ’s suffering. \n\nAs He broke the bread and offered up His body, Jesus was really giving us His whole “person” (Aramaic), His entire “being” (Greek). He then took the cup and said to them, “This is My blood that establishes the covenant; it is shed for many” (vv. 22-24). The Last Supper is the truest representation of our fellowship with Christ, and in this meal we see that His gift to us was complete.\n\nThe guests at Jesus’ final table would go on to betray Him—and not just Judas. In the end, they all deserted Him (v. 50). But even the most evil plots of men are within the scope of God’s providence. Isaiah prophesied that Jesus would be “despised and rejected by men” (Isaiah 53:3), and so it is fitting that the Lord’s Last Supper was attended by traitors. \n\nThe Lord’s Supper is not a table of virtue; it is a table of grace. Even on our best days we cannot earn His gift. He invites us to partake just as He invited the disciples—in spite of our betrayals and scheming against Him. Apart from Christ’s suffering, there simply is no gospel. \n\nNone of these preparations or promises made sense until He went to the cross. The great mystery of the gospel is revealed in Jesus’ death. \n\nThe jar that was broken to anoint Jesus was a complete gift. No one could pick up the shards and piece the pottery back together for another use later; the jar was smashed and irrevocably given (Mark 14:3). Christ was crushed for us, and His sacrifice is also freely, entirely, and totally given. We remember this every time we partake of the Lord’s Supper (Isaiah 53:5). His extravagant gift to us was not wasted and has changed the world forever.\n\n",

Would you enter into this text with me?\n\nAt the start of this chapter, we find Jesus standing before a crowd of chief priests, elders, and scribes. These men, along with Pilate, do not believe Jesus is the Son of God, and they accuse Him of many things.  \n\nFrom there, Jesus is taken in front of an even greater crowd, a “multitude.” They, too, refuse to believe He is the Son of God, and demand for Him to die a criminal’s death.\n\nThen, the soldiers take Him away and clothe Him in a robe and a crown of thorns. “Hail, King of the Jews!” they yell (Mark 15:18). But they don’t actually believe Jesus is the Son of God, and so they mock Him, beat Him, and then lead Him away. \n\nNow, as Jesus hangs on the cross, the bystanders and passersby do not believe He is the Son of God. They blaspheme Him and taunt Him. \n\nIt seems everyone—Pilate, the chief priests, the multitude, the soldiers—has denied who Christ is. Nobody believes. All are blind and darkness consumes them, both literally and metaphorically. \n\nThis is our Good Friday sermon, and we know it well. We know we have to wait until Sunday, resurrection day, before we can talk about hope and life. But if we look closely at this chapter, we see a glimmer of hope begin to slide its way in, right here, in the ninth hour as the darkness lifts and Jesus cries out His final words: “‘Eloi, Eloi, lemá sabachtháni?’ which is translated, ‘My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?’” (Mark 15:34).\n\nUntil this moment, all we have seen and heard is denial, skepticism, and accusation toward Christ. Now, in the midst of all these voices, rises one who believes: “When the centurion, who was standing opposite Him, saw the way He breathed His last, he said, ‘This man really was God’s Son!’” (Mark 15:39).\n\nFinally, the truth is spoken about who Jesus really is.\n\nAfter the centurion, Mark mentions the other believers who were present, like Mary Magdalene, “many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem,” and Joseph of Arimathea (v. 40-41). The story is still dark, Sunday is not yet here, but as these people are highlighted amongst the unbelievers, we begin to feel all is not lost.\n\nWhen I read the centurion’s words, I am reminded that our disbelief can never be so strong that it will change the truth about who Christ is. In our darkest moments, when everyone around us—in our country, school, workplace, or home—seems to deny Him, Jesus will always be the Son of God. Nothing we say or do, no amount of denial, can change that. What God ordained from the beginning of time cannot be thwarted by a mob. That was true in Mark 15, and it’s true today. \n\nI am really anxious for us to get to the next part of the story, the beautiful resurrection and the hopeful ascension. But as believers, we know there is hope smack dab in the middle of the darkness. All we have to do is look up at the cross and declare what that centurion did so many years ago. Only this time, let’s use present tense: This man really is God’s Son!\n\n",

We saw Him stand on His feet before the chief priests and their accusations, with only silence and truth as His defense. We saw Him climb a mountain and walk on water.\n\nBut then, the Gospel of Jesus on His feet came to an abrupt halt. The Messiah was led to a cross and crucified. One day. Two days. Three days in the ground, and then He was up again. The stone was rolled away, and a man shimmering in white stood to greet the women in the tomb. There was no body for them to anoint; He was gone. Jesus had been raised from the dead.\n\nAnd that’s how the Gospel of Jesus on His feet resumes, right here in Mark 16. Only now, everything has changed.\n\nHere, at the very end of Mark’s Gospel, there is a crucial shift: Jesus had completed the work He came to earth to do. He had healed and taught and traveled and forgiven and died and risen. And then, He commissioned.\n\nJesus implored and empowered His disciples to continue the ministry He began—the same disciples who, even upon hearing eyewitness testimony of Jesus’ resurrection, still didn’t believe until they saw Him for themselves. He called them to preach the gospel. Now, you go, He said to them. You heal. You teach. You spread the message of the forgiveness of sins. Get on your feet and go.  \n\nJesus called His disciples to stand up and step out, and then He did something stunning: He sat down.\n\n“Then after speaking to them, the Lord Jesus was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.”\n\n– Mark 16:19\n\nStill today, Jesus sits at the right hand of His Father. He sits because the saving work He came to do here on earth has been done. He declared as much from the cross when He cried out, “It is finished” (John 19:30). The act of salvation is sealed and cannot be undone. Now, with the assurance that our Lord lives and reigns, we get to respond to His call: Get on your feet, and go.\n\nThe disciples were not alone as they went. Jesus had promised to go with them (John 14:26), and He did.\n\n“And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them…”\n\n– Mark 16:20\n\nFriends, the Gospel of Mark is not just the “Pedestrian Gospel” because of the action of the fast-paced narrative. The Gospel of Mark is the Pedestrian Gospel because it is the plainly presented message of the gospel of Jesus Christ—the forgiveness of sins accomplished in full by His life, death, and resurrection. It is the Gospel for all of us. For her and him, for you and me.  \n\nWe’ve not just heard about Him. We’ve seen Him. By His power and grace, let’s get up and carry His good news to the world. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nThe older I get, the more wary I am of getting my hopes up. I’d hoped to get the lead in the school play, but I got a secondary role instead. I’d hoped to get into a master’s program, but I didn’t. I’d hoped that relationship would work out, but it ended. Because of this, I have become very good at what I call “hope management.” I never let my hopes get too high. In doing so, when my hopes fall, the landing is softer.\n\nThis is why I can’t blame Zechariah for questioning the angel Gabriel when he tells him, “Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will name him John” (Luke 1:13). Zechariah protests. He was an “old man” and his wife, Elizabeth, “was well along in years.” Although Zechariah was clearly in the midst of a heavenly encounter, his question has undertones of disbelief: “How can I know this?” (v.18).\n\nThis tells me that Zechariah and Elizabeth had gotten their hopes up about a child before, and Zechariah can’t face the disappointment again. He can’t name another unborn child in expectation, only to have those expectations dashed. But as a result of Zechariah’s unbelief, he is unable to speak until the day his son is born and he sees God’s promise fulfilled.\n\nMary’s response to Gabriel is different. She is told something equally unbelievable––that she, a virgin, will conceive a child. Gabriel instructs, “You will name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end” (vv.31–33).\n\nBut Mary’s question is more logistical than it is incredulous: “How can this be?” (v.34). As the CSB Study Bible says, “The difference between Mary’s response… and Zechariah’s is that Mary asked her question not from unbelief but from puzzlement.”\n\nThe nation of Israel had high hopes for a Savior for generations. I would not blame Mary for containing her hope. But she does the opposite. While Zechariah’s mouth was closed, Mary’s opens in praise: “My soul praises the greatness of the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior” (vv.46–47).\n\nThese words reflect the type of unmanaged, unharnessed hope I want to have in response to the promises of God. Instead of reserving my hope, smothering it, not letting it get too high, I want to hold hope with open hands, believing the Lord will do what He says, that He will make good on His promise to save.\n\nWhat I have that Mary didn’t at this point in her life is the end of the story. I know God made good on His promise to save. When that is where my hope lies, I cannot be not disappointed, and instead, I can declare:\n\n“The Mighty One has done great things for me, and His name is holy. \n\nHis mercy is from generation to generation” (vv.49–50).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nWhat is a book you’ve read again and again? Or perhaps a movie you’ve seen more times than you can count? Or a song you’ve had on repeat for years? Though I’ve read the words of my favorite book or watched the same scene of my favorite movie a dozen times, I often react to it differently depending on the day I’ve had or the season of life I’m in. I may feel a lot of emotion, or I may feel inspired. Other times, I may simply want to listen, watch, and savor the story. Let the words and notes sink in.\n\nSomething I love about Luke’s narrative of Christ’s birth is the array of responses from those who witnessed the Messiah, either at His birth or soon after. From awe to silence to praising God, I think we can learn as much about the significance of the incarnation from these responses as we can from the details of the birth itself.\n\nMary’s response to her son’s birth is quiet and contemplative. While the shepherds, after meeting Jesus, ran off and told everyone about what they had seen, Scripture says, “Mary was treasuring up all the things in her heart and meditating on them” (Luke 2:19). She savored the moment, holding it near to her, letting it sink into her heart and mind.\n\nSimeon, the righteous servant of the Lord, responded to meeting the Messiah by praising God and declaring the mighty works Jesus would do. As he tells Mary, “Indeed, this child is destined to cause the fall and rise of many in Israel” (v.34).\n\nThen there is Anna, the prophetess. Her response to the Messiah’s arrival was gratitude and, like the shepherds’, to spread the good news: “At that very moment, she came up and began to thank God and to speak about Him to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem” (v.38).\n\nJesus’s birth evoked silent awe, praise, gratitude, and the need to tell everyone about it.\n\nMost likely, the story of Jesus’s birth is not new for you. You’ve probably read it or heard it told again and again. But I wonder, what is it evoking in you today? Awe, joy, gratitude, praise? Do you want to shout about it from the rooftops like Anna, or do you want to be still and treasure it in your heart, as Mary did? Though our responses will vary, we are united by the reason behind the coming of the Messiah. \n\n“God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law,\n\nso that we might receive adoption as sons” (Galatians 4:4–5). \n\nWe are redeemed. We are adopted. We are a part of God’s family. No matter what kind of day you are having or what sort of season you are in—quiet and contemplative or loud and joyful—let the story of Christ’s birth remind you of these truths today.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nFrom what I can tell, John the Baptist was a man to be respected. He spoke with authority. Others came to him to be baptized. They asked him for advice. They called him teacher. Many of them even wondered if he was the Messiah.\n\nJohn could have told the crowd anything by the Jordan River that day, and the people probably would have followed him, but John used his God-given authority to point them to Christ: \n\n“I baptize you with water, but one who is more powerful than I am is coming.\n\nI am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals.\n\nHe will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire” (Luke 3:16).\n\nSeveral years ago, I took a trip to Italy with some friends. We visited the Vatican in hopes of seeing the renowned Sistine Chapel, where Michelangelo painted the ceiling. Tourist-friendly signs dotted the Vatican campus with the words “Sistine Chapel” and an arrow pointing in its direction. Or so we thought. Many of the signs simply pointed us to the next sign that said “Sistine Chapel.” We followed sign after sign until we almost gave up.\n\n“The Sistine Chapel isn’t here!” we declared dramatically. “These signs are lying to us.”\n\nWe did eventually wind our way to the chapel and see what we had come to see, but only after several detours that took us by other Vatican sites and gift shops.\n\nAs Christ-followers, we have been given a similar charge as John the Baptist—to be signs pointing toward the coming Christ. And yet, how often do I squander this opportunity? How often do I use my voice to point first to myself, rather than Christ? Speaking with authority, I take friends and loved ones on a detour of my own gospel. I give them all of my advice and all of my opinions when really what they need first is the comfort of Christ, the love of the Savior. \n\nAt the same time, I have often been a sucker for the signs, looking to others’ authority before Christ’s,  settling for my favorite pastor’s, author’s, or podcaster’s words, rather than allowing Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection to have the final word. \n\nAs we see in the response to John the Baptist, we are a people quick to worship humans and look for guidance from earthly sources. Many people claim to have authority. Dozens of signs promise to get you where you want to go, but there is only one Christ, only one Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world—and that is not John the Baptist, but the One to whom he was pointing. \n\nMay we look to Christ alone as our authority, and may we point others to Him as well, always quick to say, “one who is more powerful than I am is coming.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nTo begin His public ministry, Jesus returns to His hometown of Nazareth and preaches in the synagogue. His homecoming message is so controversial, the townspeople—the people He had known since He was a child—“drove him out of town, and brought him to the edge of the hill… intending to hurl him over the cliff” (Luke 4:29).\n\nThe crowd is with Him for the first part of His message, when He quotes the prophet Isaiah, saying He had come to preach the good news and to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor (vv.18–19). But when He mentions the widow in Sidon whom the prophet Elijah helped, and Naaman, the Syrian whom Elisha healed, the crowd gets upset. These are stories of Gentiles who were shown favor above Israelites.\n\nThe crowd would have been familiar with these stories, and they would have known their meaning. This good news Jesus was preaching was for everyone, not just the Israelites but the Gentiles also—not a popular opinion among God’s chosen people, as we can see from their response.\n\nNow, I’ve had some difficult homecomings. I’ve had disagreements with friends and family from time to time, but none of them has ever been so displeased with me that they attempted to hurl me off a cliff.\n\nIn this passage and elsewhere in Scripture, we see a common response to Jesus: People wanted His miracles, but not His message.\n\nThe crowd is amazed when He casts out a demon in Capernaum. They bring their sick to Him to be healed. They follow Him around, hoping to see Him perform other miracles. But when Jesus preaches the truth in the synagogue? They want to kill Him.\n\nJesus’s miracles were amazing, yes, but His message was convicting. People like to be amazed. They don’t like to feel convicted.\n\nI know, in my own privilege, I often prefer the turns-water-into-wine Jesus over the seeks-justice-for-all Jesus. If Jesus is just a miracle worker, I can sit back and enjoy the show. But if Jesus is first and foremost a justice-seeker, I have to get in the ring and be about His work.\n\nJesus’s message in the synagogue proves His priority was not to amaze us with His power, but to redeem us—Jews and Gentiles alike—with His blood.\n\nI can see myself in the Galilean crowd that tried to keep Jesus from leaving so they could witness more healings. I need the reminder Jesus turned and gave them: “It is necessary for me to proclaim the good news about the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because I was sent for this purpose” (v.43).\n\nThis is our purpose too. May we seek after Christ because we want to do as He did, not watch from the stands. May we remember that Jesus is our Redeemer, not a performer. And while we can stand in awe of His power to heal and cast out demons, may we be most amazed by His power to save.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nIntellect and logic would have told Jesus’s first disciples not to follow Him. They hardly knew the guy. They had stable jobs as fishermen and tax collectors. By the world’s logic, they shouldn’t have left steady paychecks to follow a practical stranger! But Jesus told Peter, James, and John, “Don’t be afraid; from now on you will fish for people” (Luke 5:10 NIV). No questions asked. No curiosity expressed at the utter strangeness of this statement. What do you mean, “fish for people”?  The men simply “left everything, and followed him” (v.11).\n\nIt was the same with Matthew. Jesus hadn’t yet shaken Matthew’s hand before He was inviting the man along, saying, “Follow me!” Matthew’s response? Leaving everything behind, “he got up and began to follow him” (vv.27–28).\n\nAs a result of the disciples’ responses, they ended up on the adventure of a lifetime. Full of pain and heartache, yes, but oh, how it was worth it.\n\nWhile reading today’s passage, I found myself feeling jealous of the disciples’ seemingly easy faith—and resonating with the Pharisees’ suspicious and questioning attitude. In some seasons, faith is easy. My heart believes. I see God at work and can faithfully follow. These days, faith is not coming as easily. My head is loud: This isn’t practical! This isn’t logical! Make a better plan for yourself! My heart is afraid: What if this doesn’t work out? What if Jesus was wrong? What if this will all be for nothing? I am uncertain of taking the next step Christ is calling me to. I am wary of the unlit path before me, even with Christ beside me.\n\nBut what does Jesus say? Don’t be afraid. Follow me.\n\nPerhaps the disciples’ faith is not the point here, so much as Jesus’s belief in them. He had faith in Peter, James, John, and Matthew, didn’t He? He saw something in them they did not see in themselves, or else He wouldn’t have asked them to follow Him. Maybe when my faith feels weak, I do not need to muster more. Maybe it’s enough to remember I was called. Sometimes faith precedes the step. Sometimes it comes after.\n\nThe response to Jesus by these first disciples is immediate and whole-hearted. They leave everything behind. They follow Him—not because they are pious or perfect, but because Jesus is worth following. All they know at this point is they want to be near Him. So do I. Let’s surrender our hearts and our heads to Christ today. Let Him lead us on the unlit path. It may have pain and heartache, but oh, my friends, I think it will be worth it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nHave you ever missed the party while it was happening? Looking back, you realized, Oh man, that was it! The magic was happening right in front of me and I didn’t see it! I find myself in this situation again and again. Hiking on a mountain but missing the view on account of stinging flies. Or brushing off my children’s impromptu theatrical performances to keep to my own schedule. I even remember being so caught up in the minutiae of pins, flowers, and curling irons on my sister’s wedding day that I forgot to take in the simple beauty and goodness of my sister transformed into a bride until we found ourselves giggling in the bathroom at her reception.\n\nWe are all prone to miss the important things. In the moment, it can be tough to even know whether something is vital until it’s too late. The Pharisees are missing a tremendous moment that is right in front of them. Because Christ wasn’t what they expected, they turned off their sense of expectation. But that’s the thing: Christ does not appear as we want Him to. His law, His logic, His person, His actions, even His teaching, do not conform to man’s way of thinking or living. He comes as Lord of the Sabbath, and if we are caught up like the Pharisees in what we imagine that to be, we miss Him as He is.\n\nIndeed, He is Lord of a kingdom that cuts against the grain of every human inclination. When He calls the twelve, He doesn’t pick from among the great or accomplished. He chooses the lowly, the ordinary, even the despised. When He heals, He does not curry favor with the high and mighty, but heals foreigners and the weak. His Beatitudes and the woes that follow overturn every modern notion of morality, self-esteem, and success. His call not to judge, but to love even our enemies, runs counter to every inclination toward self-justification and vengeance.\n\nThere are only two foundations: the foundation of Christ or the foundation of man’s natural disposition, which crumbles and fails. Instead of depending on the foundations that we build ourselves, we can stand on the foundation of the Lord of the Sabbath and stand secure. If we’re expecting Christ to be our personal sentimental version of newborn baby Jesus, we are going to miss the majesty and truth of Him as Lord of All.\n\nHere is the good news: Though we are prone to hypocrisy, to blindness, to judgment and folly, Christ comes to us anyway; He comes, loving His enemies and doing good to those who despise Him. He makes us His, and we can take comfort in this promise: “Everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher” (Luke 6:40). Christ calls us away from ourselves to Himself, and in so doing, makes us like Himself. “We know that when he appears, we will be like him because we will see him as he is” (1 John 3:2).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nThis year, as part of our celebratory Christmas decorations, we set up a fantastic black-and-cream toy train under the tree. Once a day, I would let the kids play with it for a few minutes. They would sit on their tiny knees, leaning forward and exclaiming while the train made its allotted brave journey around the tree several times. Then I’d remind them to turn it off and move on with their day.\n\nOne of my best friends laughed at me for this, saying, “You’re limiting their Christmas magic so you don’t have to spend money on replacement batteries?!” Yeah, I guess I do tend to be a little parsimonious when it comes to… well, everything. Some of us are miserly with our resources. Maybe you are a bit freer with your spending; we’re all different. But if I had an alabaster jar filled with perfume I would reluctantly parse it out over many years, and I’d be hard-pressed to slop it all out in one afternoon over a stranger.\n\nWhether you are free or tight with resources, it’s important to know when it’s time to set aside your personal inclinations. Otherwise, we are like the Pharisee who invited Jesus to his house but held back on the hospitality. If the Pharisee had realized Who was sitting at his table, and what debt of gratitude he owed Him, would he have been so close-fisted in his actions? And centuries later, knowing Jesus’s purpose and intent, would we have washed His feet and offered Him a kiss? Unless we are aware of our great debt of love, it’s hard to remember who we are and what we are called to do.\n\nWhen we realize how much we have received—how much we have been forgiven—then everything comes into perspective. We too often hold back pieces of our lives for ourselves, because we fail to see how greatly we have been forgiven. If we were to comprehend the full abundance of God’s forgiveness, how could we hold back anything from Him? In Him we have received all things, beyond what we could ask or imagine.\n\nLike the woman in Luke 7, we who have been forgiven much can appreciate the depth of Christ’s love. The more we see our need of Him, the more opportunity we have for gratefulness and love for His deep forgiveness. He doesn’t speak of the woman’s shame, only of her love.\n\nIn John’s vision of heaven, the twenty-four elders cast their crowns at the feet of Christ, crying out: “Our Lord and God, you are worthy to receive glory and honor and power!” (Revelation 4:11). Everything changes because of who Christ is. By His sacrifice, He has given us abundant forgiveness and overwhelming love. He calls us to live our lives in thankfulness—and when we remember who He is and what He has done, how can we keep from falling at His feet in grateful love?\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Parables and Miracles",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nJesus used parables to teach both the crowds and His disciples. Typically, He first spoke the parable in the hearing of all, and then in private explained it to His disciples. But even the disciples were curious about this, and so they asked Jesus, “Why are you speaking to them in parables?” (Matthew 13:10).\n\nIt’s a funny thought. Why would Jesus want to make things more complicated? Isn’t the kingdom of heaven a sufficiently difficult idea to grasp without riddles? And isn’t it hard enough to comprehend what it means that Jesus is the Messiah, even when explained in plain Aramaic?\n\nYes! And here’s Jesus’s fascinating response, “Because the secrets of the kingdom of heaven have been given for you to know, but it has not been given to them” (v.11). What?! The disciples got secrets that everyone else didn’t get? But wait, there’s more. Jesus continued, “For whoever has, more will be given to him, and he will have more than enough; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. That is why I speak to them in parables, because looking they do not see, and hearing they do not listen or understand” (vv.12–13).\n\nThey think they understand, but they don’t. Now when we read Jesus’s parable of the sower and see the Word fall on unfruitful ground, we can see what He’s talking about. Some hearts are hard, and some hearts are not ready.\n\nChrist’s Word was at the center of His ministry. His Word is valuable—His Word is life—and not everyone understood it. We stand at a wonderful time in history because now we, like His disciples, get to be taken aside to hear Him explain His own Word. The messianic mystery is made even more understandable for us than it was for the disciples because we have access to the entirety of Scripture.\n\nLike the disciples, we need Christ to interpret His Word. Without the illuminating work of the Holy Spirit, we are like those who have eyes yet see not, and have ears yet hear not. Apart from Christ, we are unfit soil and will bear no fruit.\n\nLike the disciples, we are to listen attentively and carefully, seeking to know more. We are not to clutter our hearts with the vain loves and cares of this world. “Therefore, take care how you listen” (Luke 8:18). The light of the world has come to reveal all things, and in His light, nothing remains hidden. So let us look to the Lord and ask Him to give us eyes to see, ears to hear, and hearts to believe (Acts 28:27).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Take Up Your Cross",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nIn the quiet following the large-scale, miraculous feeding of the five thousand, Jesus asked His disciples, “Who do the crowds say that I am?… Who do you say that I am?” (Luke 9:20).\n\nEveryone had their own version of who Jesus was. Many, like Herod, were curious but perplexed. Others believed Him to be Elijah, a prophet of old, or a resurrected John the Baptist. And I can’t blame them, because even with all the prophecy and typology in the Old Testament, no one had ever seen the Messiah. Jesus as Messiah was a completely new kind of being.\n\nBut good old Peter jumps right in with the correct Sunday-school answer: “God’s Messiah.” Bam! Atta boy, Peter. But even Peter’s confession was revealed to him, not by flesh and blood, but by the heavenly Father (Matthew 16:17). Even Peter needed help sorting out the right answer.\n\nAnd who is God’s Messiah? What does this designation mean? The true Messiah would be the One who would suffer and die for the sins of God’s people, and after three days rise again, though not even Peter had understood that much. The Messiah was not merely one of the prophets, or Elijah, or John. He was the One for whom John prepared the way in the wilderness. We have the advantage of history on our side, knowing that Jesus did suffer, die, and rise again. And we can use that advantage to answer with Peter, “You are God’s Messiah.”\n\nWhat should we do with this information? Right away Jesus follows Peter’s confession with: “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me” (Luke 9:23). Since I don’t have a physical, wooden cross handy, I can’t help but wonder, What does it means to “take up your cross”? Jesus laid aside His glory to bear the cross to Calvary; this was His greatest act of self-denial and obedience to the Father. It is self-denial for the glory of God.\n\nIn the same way, He calls us to set aside our own wills and be fully devoted to the Father’s will. Here’s the sticking point: This is the hardest thing on earth to do. I love doing my own will. It’s my favorite thing. And Jesus specifies that taking up one’s cross is a daily action. With the apostle Paul, our response to the risen Messiah is to die to ourselves daily (1 Corinthians 15:31). So every day, we are called to do the absolute hardest thing in the world—die to ourselves and set aside what we want.\n\nWe’re all like Peter; we can blurt out Sunday-school answers, but the very next minute, we need someone to say to us: “Get behind me Satan!” (Matthew 16:23). We aren’t able to set aside our own will so easily. So how do we take up our cross? We simply take up Christ. We fall at the beautiful feet of the One who has brought us the good news of the gospel (Romans 10:15). We cling to Him, leaning on His perfect righteousness, day after day.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nHave you ever watched kids wait for the bus? Our kids wait at the end of a long driveway, and somehow that distance makes them think they are surely out of my eyeshot. They imagine themselves in a Lord of the Flies world, where no adult can see them, and a child would willingly bludgeon his brother for fruit snacks. They act like the bus stop is a land of limbo where perfect impunity reigns supreme. But our driveway is just not that long.\n\nDrinking my coffee, I watch from the window as my own children frantically blow through a punch list of morning offenses. They are in such a hurry to let it all hang out before they find themselves under the next authority: Miss Pitt, the bus driver. She will brook no nonsense in a moving vehicle. The world is a sinful place, though, and Miss Pitt isn’t always looking in her giant rearview mirror, telling them to sit back down.\n\nMy kids aren’t outliers. We all enjoy the luxury of being out from under authority, to cut loose and do what’s right in our own eyes. And we are the people the Christ came to save. Those of us who are giving noogies, slapping faces, and stealing cookies at the bus stop—those of us who are hiding our shame, returning to our sins, and feeling beaten down by what we’ve done. We are the people Christ came to save. We’re all in the same boat. We’re just better at hiding our misdeeds than children are.\n\nThe day after Jesus’s transfiguration, He came down from the mountain, into the adorable, unwashed fray of regular humans, and He immediately encountered our brokenness. “You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long will I be with you and put up with you?” (Luke 9:41). He knows that we are trying to hide from authority, but this is exactly why He came. He came down from glory to heal a broken world.\n\nEven in the midst of His longing for our redemption, Jesus was about the business of healing, saying to the man in the crowd, “Bring your son here” (v.41). While the crowd and the disciples worried about who was supposed to be able to cast out demons, Christ had fixed His eyes upon the redemption of all things. He knew about the glory of God and was not confused by squirrely, bus-stop shenanigans. He knows that we are broken and full of terrible nonsense, but Jesus understands who He is, who His Father is, and who we are. He is not surprised that we are getting it wrong; that’s literally why He came.\n\nJesus came to save the lost and the broken. He shows forth the glory and greatness of God. Be astonished today, not at the misdeeds of man—that’s not surprising at all—but at the greatness of God’s love and grace for us. His name is great, and He is greatly to be praised (v.43).\n\n",

My dad used to take pictures of me and physically mail them to his parents. According to family legend, when my grandmother opened the envelope, she would call my dad and ask, “Why did you mail me a baby picture of you?”\n\nMy grandmother kept pictures of her family everywhere, on almost every available square inch of her walls and tables. It was one of my favorite things about her house. Every time we’d visit, we’d look at the baby picture of me next to the baby picture of my dad and marvel at the similarity; I looked exactly like my dad as a baby.\n\nScripture tells us Jesus is the exact expression of God’s nature (Hebrews 1:5). He “is the image of the invisible God,” and all of God’s fullness—all of it!—dwells in Jesus (Colossians 1:15,19). Jesus reveals this to His disciples in Luke 10, giving them a glimpse into His divinity. Jesus was God in the flesh, walking around on earth—fully man, fully God. The invisible God (John 1:18) became visible, flesh and bone, to dwell with His people.\n\nThe technical term for Jesus’s humanity and divinity is the “hypostatic union,” the mystery of His perfect union of God and man. We don’t know how that union works; we only know that it does. Jesus also tells us why the Father it is a mystery: because the Father intended it to be (Luke 10:21).\n\nThe Word became flesh and dwelt among us… we have all received grace upon grace from his fullness… No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and at his father’s side—he has revealed him (John 1:14–18).\n\nJesus came because it was the Father’s good pleasure for the Son to dwell here, to live a fully human life, to stand in our place, and to take the punishment for our sin. Jesus came to reveal the Father’s lavish love and the riches of His grace. This Jesus, who loved sinners and outcasts, who died for His people to satisfy justice and turned over temple tables in perfect, righteous anger, who wept at the death of His friend and washed His disciples’ feet—this is our God incarnate, the full and perfect expression of who our God is.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nI was home alone one evening when someone started knocking at my door. We have a rather unwelcoming “No Solicitation” sign posted on our door, and it was past the time for a postal delivery. And yet, the knocking persisted. Generally, I don’t answer the door when I’m home alone, but I peeked around the corner and saw that it was our friendly neighbor, looking exceptionally apologetic.\n\n“Do you have a corkscrew we could borrow?”\n\nWe did, and I gave it to him, and sincerely told him to knock anytime.\n\nThe parable Jesus tells in today’s reading is about a persistent neighbor, only this one is knocking and knocking and knocking at midnight, after the whole house had already gone to bed. Some commentaries call this parable humorous, a quality we don’t always assign to Jesus’s words, but in this case, the story plays out a bit like a sitcom.\n\nA man and his family are asleep in bed, when a neighbor starts knocking. Eventually, the man gets up, begrudgingly, not out of the kindness in his heart, but because of his friend’s “shameless boldness” (Luke 11:8).\n\nThe point Jesus is making is not that we should be hospitable at all costs, even dragging ourselves out of a warm bed in the middle of the night to give our neighbor some bread. He’s telling us we should approach God with the same shameless boldness of the knocking neighbor in the parable. Some translations call it the neighbor’s “impudence,” or “shameless audacity.” These are not words I typically think of when I pray.\n\nI am learning, however, to be persistent in prayer, praying the same things over and over again—not out of disbelief, but out of belief and faith. Every night, I pray the same words over my daughters: “Please show them how much You love them. Give them hearts that love You, eyes that see You, ears that hear You.” It’s not laziness, but persistence. Over and over, I ask, seek, and knock at God’s door in prayer.\n\nJesus’s illustration of persistent prayer follows the Lord’s Prayer, a tangible example of how we should pray every day. His answer to the disciples’ request, “Teach us to pray,” is two-fold. First, pray for things like these. Second, pray persistently.\n\nYesterday, in Luke 10, we read about how Jesus came to reveal the Father. Today, He shows us how we can speak to the Father. Jesus invites us to know Him. And through Him, we’re invited to know the Father, too, to pray to Him without ceasing.\n\nMay we ask, seek, and knock with persistence and faith, knowing that God will always answer for the good of all those who love Him, and to make known the riches of His glory (Romans 8:28; 9:23).\n\nMelanie Rainer is a bookworm from birth who makes her days writing, editing and reading in Nashville, where she also joyfully serves as the editor of Kids Read Truth.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nMore often than not, there are times when anxiety feels like my closest friend. It greets me in the morning, my heart rate rising with the sun. It follows me to the mirror, to the breakfast table, to the car, to work. It is the shadow I can’t get rid of, an endless churning of guilt and shame and fear in my heart and mind. It’s a disease, a chemical imbalance, a generational struggle.\n\nThis particular passage in Luke features a lot of anxiety, from the revelation that nothing hidden won’t eventually be known, to the fear of death, to the “unforgivable sin,” to Jesus’s famous command not to worry because we are worth more than the wildflowers and the sparrows.\n\nI tend to read Luke 12 as if it’s all about me: what I worry about, what I value, what I should or shouldn’t do. Don’t be like the Pharisees; fear God. Don’t be afraid; acknowledge Jesus as the Christ and don’t deny Him. Don’t blaspheme the Spirit (which is considered the “unforgivable sin,” the denial of Jesus’s work to the point that one considers it to be demonic). Don’t store up treasure for myself. Don’t worry about clothes or food—and on and on.\n\nWhile I do think Jesus is teaching us a lot about ourselves, our worldly impulses, and the things we worry about, He is also revealing much about God, His character, and His work. There are three specific truths I want to rest in today: first, the sovereignty and care of the Father; second, the advocacy of the Son; and finally, the provision of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe Father: In Luke 12:6–7, we see a clear picture of the limitless power and the all-surpassing knowledge that God possesses. Everything hidden will be revealed. This would be terrifying if it weren’t for the next part. Even though everything awful we’ve ever done will made public, our belief in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus makes us clean before God.\n\nThe Son: In verse 8, Jesus tells us that if we acknowledge Him, He will acknowledge us in the presence of God the Father (“before the angels of God” is a reference to God’s presence). He is our advocate in prayer before God, but He is also our advocate for salvation before God, the righteous Judge.\n\nThe Holy Spirit: Verse 12 teaches that the Holy Spirit is our provider, who will give us the words we need to acknowledge Christ when we are persecuted. Jesus promises His followers that the Spirit will give them what they need to continue in faith.\n\nIn a passage known for its treatment of anxiety, Luke assures us that God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit are working together in perfect unity, to care for us in perfect knowledge, perfect advocacy, and perfect provision.\n\nI may battle my anxiety until the day I walk into glory, but the death of my anxiety is assured because of the life of Jesus. The more the book of Luke reveals to me about the beauty of the Son, the closer I feel to the heart of the Father.\n\nMelanie Rainer is a bookworm from birth who makes her days writing, editing and reading in Nashville, where she also joyfully serves as the editor of Kids Read Truth.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nIn Andrew Peterson’s beloved Christmas album Behold the Lamb of God, he sings the song, “Deliver Us,” based on Jesus’s lament for Jerusalem in Luke chapter 13. He sings, hauntingly,\n\nJerusalem, Jerusalem \n\nHow often I have longed\n\nTo gather you beneath my gentle wings.\n\nEven typing these words brings tears to my eyes. Peterson captures, in a way that only master songwriters can, the ache of the ages. The song ends with those lines, an answer to the previous verses that are sung from the perspective of God’s wandering people:\n\nOur sins they are more numerous than all the lambs we slay\n\nOur shackles they were made with our own hands\n\nJesus’s lament summarizes the history of God’s stiff-necked people. Jerusalem—used here both literally, in reference to the city, and also as a metaphor for God’s people throughout time—had a history of turning away from God and abandoning the prophets, judges, and even the Messiah God had sent to them. Even earlier in this chapter, we see a specific example of the Pharisees questioning Jesus’s miracles. The crowds believed, but the leaders rejected Him.\n\nDespite the innumerable sins of His people and their continuing self-imprisonment due to their own choices, Jesus weeps over the city and the people He came to save (Luke 19:41). God longs to gather His children, to protect them, to gather them under His wings (Psalm 91:4). Jerusalem is His greatest joy (Psalm 137:6), the people He will go to the greatest lengths to save. It is the promise of the whole of Scripture.\n\nJesus stands outside of the city where He will die, and His lament is not for His death. His lament is for the people He longs to save. He has just finished warning them, telling them that by not believing Him they will not join Him in the kingdom of God. But His lament shows us that He does not make these proclamations about the narrow way out of anger, but out of grief.\n\n“How often I wanted to gather your children together…\n\nbut you were not willing!” (v.34).\n\nEven in His lament over the past and current rejection of His people, Jesus knew He would be rejected yet again in Jerusalem. But the steadfast, faithful, persistent love of the Father through the ages, embodied in the person of Christ, never fails. Love would carry Jesus all the way to the cross, into the dark tomb, and ultimately, into the glorious resurrection—where He invites us to join Him, forever.\n\nMelanie Rainer is a bookworm from birth who makes her days writing, editing and reading in Nashville, where she also joyfully serves as the editor of Kids Read Truth.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nI am uncomfortable writing about pride and humility, precisely because I have too much of one and not nearly enough of the other. I dare say I’m not alone, either. I did a little bit of cultural research when I started writing this, because I wanted to see how other people talk about humility.\n\nFirst, I found a series of business articles in prominent journals about how humility is the secret to good leadership—including an article literally titled, “17 Reasons Humility Will Help You Get Ahead.” Later, I found an article about the power dynamics of choosing your seat in a business meeting, and research about the psychology behind your choice.\n\nWhat Jesus says in Luke 14:7–14 is exactly the opposite: “But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place” (v.10). When He tells this parable, Jesus isn’t teaching a large crowd. He is eating a Sabbath meal in the house of Pharisees, the group that would be largely responsible for later placing Him on trial.\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus confronts the Pharisees three times. First, He heals a man on the Sabbath, an issue over which the Pharisees had previously confronted Him. Second, having observed the Pharisees carefully choosing their seats at the Sabbath meal, He tells a parable about being humble and always choosing the worst seat. Third, He tells another parable about a wedding feast where none of the invited guests come, so the host extends the invitation to the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.\n\nThroughout Luke, we see Jesus inaugurating the kingdom of God and proclaiming its values. He challenges the Pharisees, and He challenges our hearts. The parables He tells are for His immediate audience, but they are also for us, showing us the way life should work in His kingdom. And in the kingdom of God, humility isn’t a tactic to get ahead. It’s not a carefully-calculated decision about where to sit in a meeting, or at a party.\n\nIn his book, The Freedom of Self-Forgetfulness, Tim Keller writes:\n\nGospel-humility is not needing to think about myself. Not needing to connect things with myself. It is an end to thoughts such as, ‘I’m in this room with these people, does that make me look good? Do I want to be here?’ True gospel-humility means I stop connecting every experience, every conversation, with myself. In fact, I stop thinking about myself. The freedom of self-forgetfulness. The blessed rest that only self-forgetfulness brings.\n\nI’ll pray through those words today, asking for self-forgetfulness and gospel-humility, asking for the Spirit to convict me when I put people and things before Jesus, and praying, inspired by the words of Paul in Romans, “Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud; instead, associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own estimation” (v.16).\n\nMelanie Rainer is a bookworm from birth who makes her days writing, editing and reading in Nashville, where she also joyfully serves as the editor of Kids Read Truth.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nIf you’re fortunate, it’s been long enough since you’ve experienced being lost, that you’ve forgotten the sheer terror of it. Dig into your memories and find yourself there again, tucked into a clothing rack at a department store, searching for signs of your mama, or wandering through an unfamiliar city without your GPS, and allow yourself to feel it anew. The sweaty palms, the dry mouth, the disorientation that comes from not knowing which direction to go, the desperation to find yourself safely tucked back into the arms of the familiar.\n\nWe can’t fault the Pharisees and scribes, not really. They saw Jesus breaking bread with the “lost,” and they forgot, bless them, how remarkable it is to be found. “And the Pharisees and scribes were complaining, ‘This man welcomes sinners and eats with them’” (Luke 15:2). And so Jesus lays out a series of lessons.\n\nHe starts with sheep, a relatively disposable commodity. As a sheep farmer myself, I can say with certainty that the flock matters, as do the individual hooves and horns that make it up, but a lost sheep or two is relatively minor. That is, unless you’re the Good Shepherd… or that one sheep who’s wandered off.\n\nAs the religious leaders listened to Jesus, perhaps they counted themselves among the ninety-nine, safe in the pen of rules and right thinking. And yet, whether in the pen or gone astray, the Good Shepherd deeply loves His sheep, all of them. Pay attention to the numbers in this first scene. The ratio of lost to found is one to ninety-nine, but Jesus is about to raise the stakes.\n\nConsider a woman with ten silver coins. One slips through her fingers. It’s lost but not forgotten. She searches earnestly until the coin is in her hands. In Jesus’s second story, the ratio of lost to found is one to nine. Perhaps the Pharisees were still stifling a yawn at this point. Who cares about a single straggling sheep or even a single roll-away coin? When it comes to livestock and treasure, value is all relative.\n\nBut what about a son? Would we disregard a lost son carelessly? A loving parent would exhaust every resource to bring their lost boy home. The ratio here is intimate. One boy at home and one gone astray, one obedient and one in rebellion. Each time the Lord teaches the principle, the margins narrow. Heaven can never become so full of the saved that the Lord will cease to care about the lost.\n\nThose who bear His image are not cattle to Him. He doesn’t think of us like pennies, barely worth being picked up off the sidewalk. We are His beloved children, the apple of His eye (Psalm 17:8). At the cross, He proved He would pay any ransom for us, even if we were the only one lost in the darkness of sin. What the Pharisees didn’t see was that Jesus wasn’t just eating a meal with the lost. He was searching for lost sheep, seeking missing treasure, and running to meet His beloved sons and daughters.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nWe tend to pluck out Christ’s teachings and deliver them as neat and tidy Sunday school lessons. Every word is true and useful (Proverbs 30:5; 2 Timothy 3:16), and yet, when we place ourselves in the sandals of the original hearers and listen as they would have listened, we discover a depth we might otherwise miss.\n\nLet’s use Luke 16 as our case study for this principle. Luke 15 sets the scene. A crowd of tax collectors and sinners had gathered around Jesus, annoyed that “this man receives sinners and eats with them” (v.2). The nerve! Jesus addressed their unrighteous indignation with a string of vivid lessons. If we were watching this text unfold as a theatre performance, our program might read something like this:\n\nScene 1: A sheep, a coin, and a son—three stories about the lost.\n\nThe curtains would then fall and rise again to…\n\nScene 2: A swindler, a beggar, and a rich man—two stories about true riches.\n\nChrist’s words, “One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much” (Luke 16:10, ESV), are scribbled into the bottom of my laundry baskets as a reminder that if Jesus can’t trust me to do laundry well and with joy, He surely can’t trust me with something more significant. Laundry aside, this is the point Jesus makes in the parable of the dishonest manager. Though at first glance it might seem Jesus holds up the manager’s swindling as model behavior, it’s not the dishonesty Jesus wants us to emulate; it’s that he views money as a means to an end. So should followers of Jesus; the accumulation of wealth should never be our goal, but if we can use earthly wealth for eternal good, we will prove ourselves faithful. “So if you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will trust you with what is genuine?” (v.11, CSB).\n\nFast forward a few verses. Jesus is still responding to the hard-hearted Pharisees (vv.14–15) when He tells the tale of a rich man and a beggar named Lazarus. Lazarus dies and is in glory; the rich man dies and is in torment. After the rich man pleads for Lazarus to go to his relatives and call them to repent, the lesson ends with these words: “If they don’t hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead” (v.31). God’s Word has been beating the same drum since the beginning: wealth might make things easier in this life, but it’s not what matters for the next. End scene.\n\nJesus was talking to people who valued wealth and saw it as a sign of God’s favor, but He reminds them that the kingdom doesn’t have quite the same economy. The faith of a child—not money or possessions—is all that’s needed. Money is alluring, but it is a master who ultimately disappoints. God looks at our hearts, not our bank account statements. “And he told them, ‘You are the ones who justify yourselves in the sight of others, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly admired by people is revolting in God’s sight’” (v.15).\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nI’ve sung the hymn “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing” nearly every night for the past decade. It’s the lullaby I sing over my children as I put them to sleep. I’ve spent thousands of hours rocking a swaddled cherub in my arms and softly singing these words:\n\nCome, Thou Fount of every blessing\n\nTune my heart to sing Thy grace\n\nStreams of mercy, never ceasing\n\nCall for songs of loudest praise\n\nI mean it. Deep down in my gut, I swear I do. And yet, in the light of day, when life is hard, my heart doesn’t turn toward praise quite so easily. The Lord described us perfectly when He said, “They always go astray in their heart; they have not known my ways” (Hebrews 3:10). There’s no sense in trying to sugarcoat it.\n\nThe prophet Isaiah declared, “We all went astray like sheep; we all have turned to our own way” (Isaiah 53:6). It’s why Robert Robinson, writer of the hymn I mentioned above, included these words, “Prone to wander, Lord I feel it. Prone to leave the God I love…” And why I sing them to my babes, knowing they inherited their wandering hearts from me. I’m so prone to wander toward fear, doubt, and worry, instead of trusting that God will come through. If the measure of my blessings hinged on the amount of my faith, I’d have to go without.\n\nFaith is the only gift we have to offer the Lord. It’s what the Samaritan leper brought Jesus in Luke 17, and it was enough. “And he told him, ‘Get up and go on your way. Your faith has saved you’” (v.19). But unlike faith, the grace of God isn’t measured in mustard seeds. The “streams of mercy” we sing about are more like a tidal wave, capable of washing away our sin and guilt (Zechariah 13:1), even when our faith is frail.\n\nPerhaps the reason I’m so comforted by the words of Come Thou Fount, is because of a story I once heard about its songwriter. As it goes, one day Robinson was riding in a stagecoach when a lady asked him his thoughts on the hymn she’d been humming. Robinson reportedly replied, “Madam, I am the poor unhappy man who wrote that hymn many years ago, and I would give a thousand worlds, if I had them, to enjoy the feelings I had then.”\n\nI’m so grateful for and encouraged by the disciples’ request of Jesus, found in Luke chapter 17. They asked, “Increase our faith!” (v.5). Their words remind me of the tender prayer of a father desperate to see Jesus heal his boy found in Mark 9:24, “I do believe; help my unbelief!”\n\nProne to wander. Lord, I feel it. And yet, we serve a God who is relentless in pursuit of us (Luke 15:4).

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nIn my high school youth group, we used to play a game I loved. The game was Bigger or Better, and the object was simple: keep trading up for the biggest or best prize. To start, we were divided into teams and each team was given a single paper clip. We were then unleashed on a neighborhood with a simple assignment: “Come back with something bigger and better than this.” We’d go house to house, making trades. At first, we’d trade in the paperclip for something smallish, like a cup or dish. We’d trade that in for something bigger… say, a basketball or framed piece of art. And on and on we’d go, until we were called back together to display our spoils.\n\nTrading up is always a thrill. This is the message the rich ruler seemed to miss during his encounter with Jesus. He had his eyes on the prize of eternal life, but he misunderstood the path to getting there. Though he recognized Jesus as a “good teacher,” he missed God’s heart. This ruler was a good child who turned into a good man, and he wanted assurance that he was good enough.\n\nJesus rattled off a few of the ten commandments: “Do not commit adultery; do not murder; do not steal; do not bear false witness; honor your father and mother” (Luke 18:20). To which the man had the audacity to respond, “I have kept all these from my youth” (v.21). But even if this man had been perfectly obedient with these commandments, keeping the letter of the law is not the same as following the heart of the God behind that law.\n\nJesus offered him a trade up.\n\nInstead of keeping all the rules, the man could sell all his belongings. You see, Jesus knew that despite his outward obedience, the rich young ruler was missing out. His money was in the way. Rather than asking the man to make a tremendous sacrifice—another religious task—Jesus was really offering the man his freedom. But it does not always appear that way to those of us who hear such offers. No wonder the crowds declared, “Then who can be saved?” (v.26).\n\nJesus’s response: “What is impossible with man is possible with God” (v.27).\n\nGo on, bring to the Lord whatever you hope will save you. Bring your good works and best days. Bring your charity and church membership. Bring your idyllic childhood and productive adulthood. And trade them in. He may not ask you to sell everything and give the proceeds to the poor, but He will ask you to part with anything in your life that’s keeping you from knowing the love of God.\n\nAccept Christ’s invitation to lay down your goodness for something better. It’s a trade up.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nOne of the great riddles of being human is what to do with all the waiting.\n\nWe wait for the seasons to change.\n\nWe wait for our hurts to heal.\n\nWe wait for our children to grow up… then wait for them to return home.\n\nWe’re all waiting for something, and as my favorite rocker, the late Tom Petty, liked to remind us, “The waiting is the hardest part.”\n\nPay close attention to what’s happening in Luke 19, and you’ll see that while Christ’s followers were celebrating His triumphal entry into Jerusalem, they were waiting too. Verse 11 reveals, “As they were listening to this, he went on to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem, and they thought the kingdom of God was going to appear right away” (emphasis mine).\n\nThe crowds were following Jesus, expecting Him to bring an end to their waiting. They thought He would enter Jerusalem, exile the government that had been oppressing them, and establish the glorious kingdom He’d been telling them about. This is the moment, they must have thought, when all the waiting—for freedom, for peace, for victory—will surely pay off. \n\nBut Jesus wasn’t about to stage a coup. He was marching toward the cross. The crowd’s hopes and dreams for the establishment of Christ’s kingdom on earth would have to wait. (At least for the kingdom the way they had expected it).\n\nFast-forward to today. You’re still waiting too. So am I. We want to see God move in our lives. We want to watch Him come in power and abolish everything that causes us pain. Instead of wringing our hands and pacing the floor, what can we do while we wait?\n\n“The whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen” (v.37). Though at this point the crowds still assumed Jesus was going to lead a military victory, they were right to rejoice over what they had already seen in anticipation of what was still to come.\n\nThe greatest indicator of what Christ will do is what He has already done. In every season of waiting we can join with the “multitude” of saints in declaring the victories He’s already given. The disciples had no way of knowing they were watching a preview of a future celebration of Christ’s triumph, when He will one day return in glory:\n\n“Then I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse. Its rider is called Faithful and True, and he judges and makes war with justice… The armies that were in heaven followed him on white horses, wearing pure white linen… And he has a name written on his robe and on his thigh: King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Revelation 19:11,14,16).\n\nCelebrate every promise you’ve seen Him fulfill, every victory He’s ever secured, every blessing He’s every poured out. They are the down payment for the moment when all of our longings will be fulfilled. May we worship while we wait.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nPatrick and I sat in a tasting room with ten strangers, drinking wine from delicate glasses. Before us, an expanse of windows revealed a golden hillside. Our host raised a bottle of cabernet and smiled. As he poured the red wine, he told us about the vineyard’s renowned owner, John Shafer, a man who, in 1972 had left a successful banking career in Chicago to purchase farmland in California. A pioneer in American winemaking, John Shafer’s wines helped put Napa Valley on the map.\n\nEnraptured by the tale and tastes, I almost didn’t hear the door open behind me. Turning, I saw an elderly man walk in, using a cane. Wrinkled but smiling, he had blue eyes and a faint suggestion of hair on top of his head.\n\n“Well, here he is,” the tasting host said, standing quickly from the table. “This is John.”\n\nI could tell from the flabbergasted look on our host’s face, that this was no normal drop in. At ninety-two years old, the vineyard owner rarely made appearances. For decades, he’d put in the hard work of tending grapes. Now, he trusted his sons and staff to maintain his legacy. As I stared at John Shafer’s face, I felt like I was in the presence of royalty. In his presence, I cared a lot less about the wine and a lot more about the man who’d made it.\n\nThroughout Scripture, a “vineyard” is used as a metaphor for the nation of Israel. In Luke 20, the crowd listening to Jesus’s parable would have recognized that symbol. With this story, Jesus proclaimed that if the Israelites rejected Jesus, the promises and inheritance of God would go to new owners. In other words, God was about to offer His grace, kindness, and salvation to the Gentiles. The chief priests, scribes, and elders reacted quickly, shouting, “That must never happen!” (v.16).\n\nImagine if John Shafer had turned to me, and right there in front of his employee, said, “Claire, I’d like you to take over the day-to-day operations of this place.” Consider if he’d smiled, raised a hand, and pointed to the land outside those shining windows. “The whole thing is under your management.” Do you think his employee would have raised a toast? Not likely. Instead, they would have thought the owner had gone mad.\n\nFor millennia, Jews held claim to the exclusive privileges of being God’s people. They couldn’t believe those blessings could extend to anyone else. Jesus’s presence, His kindness to Samaritans and women and disabled people, His claims to be the Son of God—threatened everything the Pharisees held to be true. They were in the presence of the vineyard owner, and yet they refused to release their death grip on the grapes. They couldn’t see the person because their eyes couldn’t look past their own power.\n\nIf I felt awed by the presence of John Shafer in a tasting room, how much more should I be in awe of Jesus, who hands me the keys to His kingdom? It’s a kindness so kind, it might be seen as irresponsible. He has given us an inheritance that is “imperishable, undefiled, and unfading” (1 Peter 1:4). Some may reject Him, but to all who receive Him, Jesus gives the right to become children of God (John 1:12).\n\nHe steps forward, points to the vineyard, and says, “My beloved sister, enjoy.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nOne of the great perks of being a novelist is the research. Recently, for reasons that are not fully apparent to me, I’ve been devouring anything I can read about Italian orphanages during and after WWII. I’ve even connected with an eighty-year old Neapolitan man through Facebook. Through Google translate, he’s shared about his experience growing up under the care of a Christian family, the Santis, who ran the only Protestant orphanage in Southern Italy, a place called Casa Materna.\n\nThough Casa Materna is now closed, I immediately ordered every book on Amazon about the place. In reading about the Santi family during WWII, I was struck by one situation in particular. Under constant surveillance by Mussolini’s fascist spies, Papa Santi, the founder of Casa Materna, was arrested for his activities and his preaching. At the trial, the judge asked him what he preached every Sunday at the orphanage. In response, Papa Santi began reading directly from the New Testament! His unjust persecution turned into an opportunity for unparalleled witness.\n\nFrom my position of safety and wealth, WWII might seem like ancient history. But I am really just two generations removed from that reality—a reality that may have looked a lot like Jesus’s prediction of the end of the age.\n\nJesus doesn’t sugarcoat the truth for His disciples. He explains that the future is going to be full of war, famine, plagues, and natural disasters. He describes the destruction of the temple, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the persecution of believers. It is a picture of great chaos. And yet! In the midst of that chaos, His followers are to stand firm and lift their heads.\n\nMuch like Papa Santi in the midst of the chaos of WWII, Jesus’s followers are not to be distracted by the chaos of the kingdoms of the world, but to keep their eyes focused on the kingdom that is coming, one that cannot be shaken. Jesus is our only hope, our only comfort. Despite the chaos of the world, He will still come back. The Son of Man will not leave us as orphans. He will come with power and great glory. He is coming back to rescue us. It is a certainty. He promises, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away” (Luke 21:33).\n\nWe shouldn’t expect our future to look much different from what Papa Santi faced in his lifetime. But what Jesus told His disciples is still true for us. We do not need to prepare our defense against the world; we need only to draw close to the Defender.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nWhen I was a freshman in college, I grew in my faith like never before. I became captivated by the gospel, thirsty for truth, and passionate about Jesus. It was one of the sweetest and most vibrant chapters of my faith, but this explosive growth was accompanied by one negative consequence: self-righteousness.\n\nWith my newfound convictions, I felt strongly about the way things should be done, and the way things should not be done. When I went home on breaks, I lectured my parents about our home church and the things that needed to change. I pronounced harsh judgments on friends who were not following Jesus. I frowned disapprovingly when my boyfriend’s parents drank wine with their dinner. I was, in a word, insufferable.\n\nThankfully, my parents were patient and wise. They listened and gently challenged some of my thinking, but they also recognized I was young and in need of shepherding. In contrast with my demeanor, they showed grace.\n\nI will never forget that season of my life, when my love for Jesus resulted in some very un-Jesus-like behavior. I will forever be humbled by it, because it continues to remind me of the truth that human brokenness and sin runs deep, perverting even our noblest intentions.\n\nIn Luke 22, this aspect of sin is on full display. First we have the chief priests, who oversee Jesus’s arrest. In his commentary, The Gospel of Luke, New Testament scholar Joel B. Green explains that these religious leaders “believe themselves to be serving God, yet unwittingly serve a diabolical aim.” Then, we have a disciple who, in his desperation to defend his teacher, draws his sword and cuts off the ear of a chief priest’s servant. Swiftly and sharply, Jesus condemns this violence (v.51).\n\nWithin this scene we see two different types of people who are trying to honor God and doing just the opposite instead. How can we avoid doing the same?\n\nFirst, we must admit that we will inevitably do the same, because we are human. The same brokenness that runs through the high priests, and the same brokenness that runs through the disciple (Peter, according to the parallel account in John 18) also runs through us. We will get it wrong, and that is precisely why we need a Savior. Even our best efforts can become mangled by sin. That said, the Lord’s Table—which sits at the center of this chapter—is a compass of sorts.\n\n“And he took bread, gave thanks, broke it, gave it to them, and said,\n\n‘This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me’” (Luke 22:19).\n\nWhen Jesus instructs His disciples to remember, He is not only talking about His death. He is also talking about the example He set throughout His life. Jesus is the Savior who does not need weapons or worldly power to achieve His means. Jesus transformed the entire world by humbling Himself and laying Himself down—first in a manger, and then on a cross—and this is the standard to which we are held. This is how we preach Christ, without opposing Him in the process.\n\n \n\nSharon Hodde Miller leads Bright City Church in Durham, NC with her husband Ike.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nOn September 11, 1934, theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote the following words in a letter to a friend:\n\n“We must finally stop appealing to theology to justify our reserved silence about what the state is doing—for that is nothing but fear. ‘Open your mouth for the one who is voiceless’—for who in the church today still remembers that that is the least of the Bible’s demands in times such as these?”\n\nBonhoeffer penned this plea as the Nazi regime was gaining power, the death toll was growing, and many of his fellow Christians remained silent. He watched in horror as the German church failed to speak up and do what was right, choosing instead the false innocence of silence.\n\nEighty-five years later, it is easy to look back and judge. It’s easy to wonder how Christians in Germany failed so miserably. And yet, to do so is to deny one of the most common tactics of sin: shifting blame.\n\nBlame-shifting is a thread that runs throughout Jesus’s trial in Luke 23. Pilate knows Jesus is innocent, and he does not want to execute him, and so he hands Jesus off to Herod (v.7). Herod, in turn, sends Jesus back to Pilate (v.11). Pilate then appeals to Jesus’s accusers, suggesting that a lesser punishment would be appropriate (v.16–20). But the crowds are unsatisfied. They will settle for nothing less than the death penalty. For a third time, Pilate pleads with the crowd to be reasonable (v.22), but they will not be dissuaded. Finally, Pilate finally hands Jesus over to them.\n\nIt would have been easy for Pilate to blame the crowd for Jesus’s fate. After all, he spoke up—multiple times!—but they insisted. What more could he have done? It also would have been easy for Herod to blame Pilate. After all, he didn’t kill the man. He simply handed him over to someone else.\n\nThis is what sin does. It shifts blame while insisting on its own innocence: So long as I wasn’t the one nailing Jesus to the cross, or rounding up my Jewish neighbors, or leading the lynch mob—I am innocent.\n\nHowever, when we read the story of Pilate, we are reminded that God holds us to a far higher standard. The story of Pilate chastens us with the truth that a holiness built on omission, inaction, and looking the other way is no holiness at all.\n\nIn Stuart Townend’s famous hymn, “How Deep the Father’s Love for Us,” he describes the events of Luke 23 this way:\n\nBehold the man upon a cross,\n\nMy sin upon His shoulders;\n\nAshamed, I hear my mocking voice\n\nCall out among the scoffers.\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine mocking our beloved Jesus. It’s nearly impossible to envision a time when we might look into His heartbroken eyes and jeer, impossible to imagine that we might be included among those for whom He prayed, saying, “Father, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing” (v.34). But the tragic story of Pilate reminds us that sometimes the loudest act of abandonment is choosing to say nothing at all.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller leads Bright City Church in Durham, NC with her husband Ike.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nThis year, my husband and I started a church, and in many ways it has been the most amazing adventure of our lives. We have seen signs and wonders, answers to prayer, supernatural provision, and the fruition of God-given vision. My husband and I have been awed and amazed, and truly, we will never be the same.\n\nAnd yet…\n\nAll along, during these months of amazement, I have noticed something funny in my soul. Call it an “inability to digest.” I have seen the miraculous with my own two eyes. I have experienced it, and I have lived it. And still, a part of me wonders, Really? Did that really happen? It’s as if my faith cannot catch up. No matter what God does, no matter how powerful and unforgettable, my brain struggles to wrap itself around the truth.\n\nThis is the dilemma of being a finite human being who worships an infinite God. As long as we live on this earth, we will struggle to grasp the ways of God. We observe this struggle in Luke 24. First, there are Jesus’s closest female companions, who have followed Him and supported Him all the way. By this point, they should have “gotten it,” yet when they see the empty tomb, they still have to be asked, “Why are you looking for the living among the dead?” (v.5). Then, in verses 36–37, when Jesus appears to the disciples, they assume they are seeing a ghost. Even after studying His hands and feet, they were still wrestling with disbelief (v.41).\n\nWhat this tells us is that faith is much harder than we often like to admit, and we see this theme woven throughout the Gospels. Over and over, Jesus’s followers fail to understand Him, and they struggle to believe. Whether it’s Jesus’s purpose, identity, or plan they’re misunderstanding at any given moment, they are consistently unable to keep up. Their faith never does keep pace with all that Jesus is doing.\n\nAnd I get it. This year, I have found myself in that place again and again, fumbling for a faith that matches the magnitude of all that God is doing around me. It’s humbling and convicting.\n\nThankfully, the good news of Jesus Christ does not rise and fall on the size of our faith. If that were the case, Jesus’s disciples would not have accomplished very much. Instead, the gospel of Jesus Christ rises and falls on the reality of His life, death, resurrection, none of which is strengthened or diminished by our ability to fully comprehend it.\n\nThis is the grace we have in Christ. Our faith will never match the size of His works. Our belief will never catch up to all that He is doing. But the story of Luke is the story of God using imperfect people with imperfect faith to accomplish Christ’s mission in the world. All that God requires is a willing heart—willing to try, and willing to fail—trusting Him to redeem the whole of it.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller leads Bright City Church in Durham, NC with her husband Ike.

We didn’t need another casserole or vase of sympathy flowers; we needed words. \n\nVoid of compassion, the blank document—an unforeseen obituary—stared back at us, wringing all adjectives of their meaning, one after another. Each suggested description seemed to shrink our beloved boy, the one who held the titles of both my best friend and my younger brother, into someone foreign and unrecognizable. The task of fitting all of his life and all of our love into one small newspaper column was exhausting, so we traded our pencils for pillows and gave up for the night. \n\nA few hours later, unable to sleep, I rolled over to see a small beam of light coming from downstairs, and decided to follow it. I found my sleepy-eyed father furiously scribbling notes on a stack of white index cards. Between the light blue lines were favorite stories, memorable quotes, and beloved quirks. My dad handed me a stack, and as the dark sky faded into morning, our collection of cards finally created the outline of something familiar—someone familiar. \n\nI imagine the Apostle John sitting down to translate the encounters he’d had with Jesus into suitable words. To him, Jesus was not a faraway character, but a trusted friend and beloved Savior. Writing these words, this Gospel account, John probably recalled intimate details about Jesus—the way He smelled, what His favorite foods were, the sound of His laugh. He could clearly call to mind the expressions his friend made when feeling tired or excited or somber. Yet, John undertook the task of assembling words to describe the heaven-sent Son of God to those of us who didn’t know Jesus in the flesh.\n\nJohn must have had a wealth of stories to choose from when deciding how to open his eyewitness account. But, through the Holy Spirit’s inspiration, this dear friend of Jesus begins his narrative with the thing that identified Jesus most: \n\n“In the beginning was the Word,\n\nand the Word was with God,\n\nand the Word was God.”\n\n– John 1:1\n\nAfter years of witnessing Jesus’ parables, miracles, and interactions firsthand, John presents Jesus as the Word—a tangible love letter from God. Jesus did not come to merely deliver a message from God—He Himself is the message. \n\n“The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.”\n\n– John 1:14\n\nThe Apostle John’s words are not only the beginning to another chapter in the Bible; they are the beginning to understanding who Jesus is. He is our promised Savior. He is the one who has been with God from the beginning. He is the Word.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: John 2:1-25, Psalm 104:14-15, 1 Peter 4:11\n\nI have always wondered why Jesus gave permission to not believe on account of Himself alone. After all, wasn’t it He, who claimed to be the way, the truth, and the life? That no man comes to the Father except through the Son? (John 14:6). Why then, did Jesus Himself say, “If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me; but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works” (John 10:37,38). Even if, Jesus said. Even if you cannot believe His words, believe the works of His hand.\n\nPastor and author Tim Keller calls Jesus the Lord of the wine, the feast, the party, and basically, the greatest time ever. We know this because His very first miracle—the first work of His man hands—was the turning of water into wine. Nay, the best wine. And the disciples marveled, John tells us; they believed in Him (John 2:11). It was because of a miracle that His disciples believed in Him, and it was on account of His miracles that many came to Him. \n\nI find it hard to trust sometimes. Don’t you? It seems sometimes that God is intricately interested in the plans and futures of so many others, while He feels far off from me. His presence feels not as near and His words sound not as bright. I find it hard to believe Him in those moments. It’s much easier to believe the God who answers my prayers, clears my ways, and makes straight my paths. It’s easier to believe the God who is there. \n\nI think Jesus knew this. In our common vernacular, I imagine His words sounded something like this: “If you cannot believe me (even though I’m doing these works right in front of you), can’t you believe on the evidence of me?” \n\nI don’t know whether Jesus was disappointed with the people for being incredulous at what played out in front of their eyes, in their skepticism and doubt. But sometimes, when God feels far from me, I remember the glory of Jesus and imagine these words to be more tender than perhaps He meant them. I imagine He knows to believe is hard enough, and even harder when our hearts have grown hard and our hearing dull, and this is why He worked miracles during His short time on earth. He wanted so deeply for the people to believe and see and understand and come and follow Him. \n\nRecently, at Christmas, we celebrated the coming of God to earth not only as man, but as baby. That baby grew into a man, changed water to wine, healed blind eyes, raised the dead, commanded the storm to be silent, and then He died an unjust and brutal death. But this can never be the end of our gospel story, because the most miraculous event comes after: His own resurrection and the proffered gift to us of eternity with Him. Jesus is one long succession of miracles, from birth until death and then life again. His glory is on display from the beginning of time until now, this very second, even in my doubt and my struggle with belief.\n\nI know so many of us struggle to believe with all our hearts that all Jesus’ words and love are true. But do you see His miracles? He didn’t do them for the healed, calmed, and raised alone. He did them for you and for me, and for all humanity. His best glory is the belief of His children.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner. She blogs at Sayable, tweets @lorewilbert, and posts photos @loreferguson.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: John 3:1-36, Ezekiel 36:25-27, 1 Timothy 2:5-6\n\nJohn 3:16 wins the prize for the most well-worn verse in the Bible. Scribbled on bathroom stalls, held high on signs at basketball games, or added to the gear of NFL quarterbacks, John 3:16 is seemingly everywhere. When things become familiar, they sometimes lose their ability to “wow” us. But we still need John 3:16.\n\nIn John 3, we find Jesus in a clandestine conversation with Nicodemus, a Pharisee and influential Jew (v. 1). Nicodemus was trying to wrap his well-educated, powerful brain around the fact that the Savior of His people didn’t look like, act like, or teach like Nicodemus thought he should. What Nicodemus was really wrestling with was the gospel. \n\nI’ve always had a soft spot for Nicodemus, probably because I’ve stepped into the ring and gone a few rounds with the gospel myself. There is a tiny corner of my mind and heart that gets it: I am a sinner, deserving of eternal separation from a holy God. Through His death on the cross, Jesus paid the penalty for my sin and made a way for me to be reconciled to the Father (Romans 6:23). But I struggle to convince my whole self that the gospel can be this simple. \n\nSurely, I need a lot of good works to save me.\n\nI mess up so often, God must have changed His mind about me.\n\nMaybe if I run myself ragged, involving myself in every possible ministry, I will please God.\n\nThese are the things I tell myself nearly as often as John 3:16 shows up on the side of a semi-truck. It’s what we see when we read between the lines when Nicodemus said to Jesus, “But how can anyone be born when he is old?. . . Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born?” (John 3:4). \n\nA few short verses later, we see Nicodemus finally collide with gospel truth: \n\n“For God so loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.”\n\n– John 3:16\n\nThis is so good! Let’s keep reading: \n\n“For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.”\n\n– John 3:17\n\nWhen I try to create a list of requirements for my salvation, I do so out of fear and forgetfulness—like Nicodemus. I’m fearful of being punished and forgetful of God’s character. But God loves us so much! That’s why He sent Jesus here—not to condemn us but to save us. His perfect plan for salvation is laid out for us in John 3:16-17. \n\nMay these words from our Savior never grow stale in hearts and minds, and may we never grow tired of hearing them.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nText: John 4:1-54, Isaiah 55:1-3\n\nI wonder if she spotted Him from a distance, a man sitting at the well alone—her well, the one she visited daily. I wonder if, as she drew closer, she could make out Jesus’ face and recognize His nationality. A man—a Jewish man—sitting at her well?\n\nShe approached, probably confused. Maybe even a bit afraid. Then, Jesus spoke to her.\n\nIn this story from John 4, Jesus broke through at least three cultural and social barriers of His time:\n\n1. He spoke to a woman, and traditionally, Jewish men were not to be seen conversing with women.\n\n2. He spoke to a Samaritan, and as the Scripture says, Jews had no dealings with Samaritans at the time (v. 9).\n\n3. He spoke to a woman He knew was an “adulteress”—a woman who had more than one husband and was with a man she wasn’t married to.\n\nYet, Jesus spoke to her. A woman. A Samaritan. A sinner.\n\nAnd He didn’t just say hello. Over the course of their brief and profound conversation, He offered her the gift of a lifetime: living water, eternal life. “But whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty again,” Jesus said to her (v. 14).\n\n“Sir,” she said, “give me this water, so that I won’t get thirsty and come here to draw water” (v. 15). \n\nThere she was, standing beside the Messiah in the flesh, and she didn’t fully understand what He was telling her. She took His offer of living water literally. She didn’t get it—not yet.\n\nI love this part so much because it paints such a real and beautiful picture of grace. You don’t have to fully “get it” to receive it.\n\nThat part is hard for me, a lifelong Christ follower, to accept. Unlike the Samaritan woman, I have the knowledge. I like to think that I know Jesus and His story, that I know the right answers and theology. But this story says the gift of Christ is for anyone who wants to receive it—no matter how little you know, how little you have been taught, or how wayward you have lived. Grace reminds us how level the playing field is. \n\nThe Samaritan woman wanted what Jesus offered. She knew this if she knew nothing else. “Give me this water,” she said. And that’s all she had to say.\n\nThat’s all we have to say, too. From the woman frantically checking all her Bible-study boxes to the woman buried under the weight of past sin and shame, this promise is for all of us. Because we’re all thirsty. We’re all weary. We are all desperate for the Jesus who stands at the well offering the exact and only thing we need.\n\nGive me this water, we say, breathless and tired. And He does.\n\n \n\n\n\n",

Scribble marks adorned two chapters in Luke—big loopy scribbles in permanent blue ink. “Oh, no!” reverberated within. This was my favorite Bible, the one I spent time with daily over a hot cup of coffee. I was learning to do inductive study with this Bible and marking key words with care. I’d cringe if I had to erase a bit of colored pencil, knowing it wouldn’t be clean. But this was more than a smudged word. Two entire pages had been ruined.\n\nI sat my little girl on my lap to explain gently that she couldn’t color in mommy’s Bible. She’d meant no harm, of course, but this was a teachable moment. She simply couldn’t go around taking pen to paper in books around the house.\n\nBut in that moment the Lord graciously spoke to my heart. My daughter hadn’t taken a pen to any other books, only this book. She was modeling what she’d seen.   \n\n“Sweetie, were you ‘studying’ like Mommy?”\n\nShe smiled, nodding her head big.\n\nIt became my teachable moment. Instead of focusing on “the rules” or my own angst over the pages, I could see the bigger picture. God had been moving in my little girl’s heart, drawing her to His Word. She wanted to interact with it in the only way she knew how. Lifting my focus helped me to see God at work, which changed everything.\n\nIt’s often easy to miss God’s hand at work, just as many did when Jesus walked the earth. I’m astounded when I read of the man Jesus healed by the pool of Bethesda, because of the scene afterward. People had seen this man laying around for thirty-eight years, and suddenly he was walking. Yet, no one said, “Wow! What happened? How were you cured?” No one praised God that he’d been delivered from decades of infirmity. Instead, the healed man is chastised for carrying his pallet on the Sabbath. And the Jewish leaders want to know, not who cured him, but who had the audacity to tell him to pick up his pallet and walk with it (John 5:12).  \n\nJesus, the Son of God, was there among them. A miracle had been done in their midst. Yet, focusing on the rules of the Sabbath, they missed the Lord of the Sabbath.  \n\nHow often do we do the same? How often are we so focused on one side of a circumstance that we miss God’s purposes altogether?\n\nJesus is the Author of life. And He brings not only life, but light, grace, and glory into that which seems dead, dark, and overwhelming (Acts 3:15; 2 Corinthians 4:6). We’re told to walk by faith and not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7) because when our eyes are faith-filled, we see the divine. We see God. \n\nJesus is always working, in every facet of our lives and the lives of those around us. Let’s pray to keep our eyes fixed on Him, so we can behold every moment.\n\nKim Cash Tate is the author of several books, including Though I Stumble (2016) and Cling:  Choosing a Lifestyle of Intimacy with God (2017).

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nText: John 6:1-71, Acts 3:22-23, Psalm 29:10-11\n\nThe day after Jesus miraculously multiplied loaves and fish, the crowd He fed went looking for Him. They loaded into boats and stalked Jesus across the Sea of Galilee. When they found Him, Jesus knew the real reason they had come: “You are looking for Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate the loaves and were filled. Don’t work for the food that perishes but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you” (John 6:26-27).\n\nThe crowds didn’t yet understand the meaning of the Bread Jesus spoke of, so they took Him literally and hoped He would perform the miracle again. They begged, “Sir, give us this bread always!” (v. 34).\n\nIt sounds demanding, right? A little superficial? How could these people stand before the Son of God who offered them eternal life and demand more barley loaves instead?\n\nIt sounds ridiculous, but it also sounds familiar. I’ve done this before with my prayers and requests. I have often begged for bread (and when I am asking Him for bread, it’s the lower-case bread). I am asking for what I want instead of Jesus Himself. Because, admittedly, what I want is often not Jesus.\n\nOur conversations might go something like this:\n\nMe: I want a new job! I hate this one!\n\nJesus: Here is contentment. It will put your soul at rest. This is what you need. Not a new job.\n\nMe: I want a husband now because everyone else I know is getting married!\n\nJesus: Here is trust. Trust in me and our relationship will deepen.\n\nMe: I don’t know what to do. Give me a sign!\n\nJesus: Here I am. My Spirit lives inside of you, guiding you all the time.\n\nI need the same explanation the crowd did that day when Jesus said, “I am the bread of life.”\n\nThe Bread of Life is so much more than the bread I ask for. It endures (v. 27). It gives life to the whole world (v. 33). It is given freely to those who believe (v. 29). Those who eat it will abide in Christ, and Christ will abide in them (v. 56).\n\nThe true miracle of the Bread of Life is that Jesus is all we need. All that other stuff we are hoping will fill our bellies up? It is nothing compared to Christ Himself.\n\nAfter a bit of refining and a lot of grace, my hope is that we will look up one day and realize that our prayers for perishable things can be simplified into one prayer. May we grow to want only one thing and passionately learn to pray, “Give us Jesus, always!”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: John 7:1-53, Leviticus 23:39-41, Joel 2:28-29\n\nWhen I was a young girl, I loved to visit my father’s elementary school. He was the principal, and being the principal’s daughter made me feel special. I especially loved the times he sent me on errands. I would walk into the cafeteria or library, looking like any other student. But when the staff learned who I was—and that I’d been sent by my father, the principal—it made all the difference. All that he represented was attached to me.\n\nI love that the book of John sets itself apart from the other Gospels in the way it showcases Jesus as the Son of God. While Matthew, Mark, and Luke together have a handful of instances in which Jesus refers to Himself as “sent” by God, John records more than thirty. As Jesus talked to the crowds—and in particular, to the Jewish leaders—He used some version of these words: “Him who sent me… the One who sent me.” \n\nJesus’ choice of words was purposeful. The Jewish people knew that God had promised to send a Savior. It’s amazing to me that Jesus would tell them so plainly, so many times, that He was the “sent” One. In chapter 7 alone, those words appear five times:\n\n“My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me” (John 7:16).\n\n“… but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him, He is true… ” (John 7:18).\n\n“I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me” (John 7:29).\n\n“For a little while longer I am with you, then I go to Him who sent Me” (John 7:33).\n\nAnd this one:  “I have not come of Myself, but He who sent me is true…” (John 7:28).\n\nGod the Father had been true to His promise. He had sent His Son for the salvation of mankind.  Yet, many who walked and talked with Jesus—who heard Him testify repeatedly that He was the sent One—did not believe.\n\nSo many precious truths are repeated this way throughout the Bible, and I can’t help but wonder at just how often I’m slow to believe them. For instance, while some version of “Do not fear” appears hundreds of times throughout Scripture, there are still countless circumstances arising in day-to-day life that tend to stoke fear deep within my heart. The Bible is replete with assurances of peace and joy despite what’s happening around us. But how long does it take to believe those assurances in a given situation? God trumpets His love for us, unconditional and eternal, a love unsurpassed by any human love we could ever experience. Yet, when we feel the sting of rejection from a friend or loved one, we suddenly feel alone.\n\nGod keeps His word. If a promise is given just once in the Bible, He is faithful to fulfill it. By His grace, He often repeats those promises, giving added assurance to our hearts. With faith, we can stand on those promises and believe, because there is another promise that’s often repeated: our God is true (John 7:28-29). \n\nNo matter how many promises God has made to us, they are all made complete in Jesus. He was sent from God for our salvation, making us daughters of the King. We can believe Him. And when we do, receiving His promises as His children, we bring Him glory (2 Corinthians 1:20). \n\n \n\nKim Cash Tate is the author of several books, including Though I Stumble (2016) and Cling: Choosing a Lifestyle of Intimacy with God (2017).

This year they’ve been abrupt, noisy, shoving—everything mornings should not be. I am disgruntled while I tie my shoes. It’s barely past 5am. I know mothers and wives and fathers and farmers and workers all over the world wake up this early, but I am self-employed and childless and have convinced myself I’m owed uninterrupted sleep until at least 6am. Our dog does not agree, and in fact, seems to think the fastest way to my heart right now is through her leash. She noses me until I relent and meet her at the front door.\n\nOutside, the moon is a pregnant belly, super and bright, shining the whole still-dark neighborhood over. How strange, I think, that the Son of God would call Himself the “light of the world,” when the most constant earthly source of light disappears every night, then reemerges as varying sizes and shapes, a mere reflection of the original source. \n\nBut this morning I remember the pillar of fire by night and the cloud by day (Exodus 13:21-22); I remember the star shining in the east (Matthew 2:1-2), the day the sun stood still (Joshua 10:12-13), and the day the earth went dark (Matthew 27:45-54). I think about how the God of the universe created the orbs and commands them even now. He is the One who sets clouds the size of a man’s fist in the sky and makes it rain for forty days and forty nights (Genesis 7:11-12). Storms cease at the sound of His voice (Mark 4:35-41). \n\nJesus tells us, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life” (John 8:12). But the kind of of light He offers, is not of the natural, earthly sort. His light is supernatural and He freely offers it to whomever would follow Him.\n\nYes, Jesus is the light of the world, but when our hope is in anything or anyone other than Him, the world can go grow terribly dark in a hurry. I tend to believe Jesus is near and present when I can clearly see His hand at work in my life. But when I cannot see Jesus at work in my life, He seems absent, distant and busy, too tied up with more important things—more important people—than me.\n\nBut this morning, the supermoon shines a deceptive light on my path, blue, dim, shadowed. Not sunlight, but still of the sun—whether I can see it or not. Walking with the light of the world is like that, too, I think to myself. I am still walking in darkness but I know the light exists. \n\nI come back home to a still, dark, quiet house, with a somewhat less rambunctious pup. She snores beside me on the floor and I drink my coffee slowly, quietly. I have the light of life, I think to myself, even today, in this season that feels dark in many ways. I have the light of life because I follow Jesus, and He never fails to shine, even when His light feels hidden by this world and the brokenness within it. \n\nHe is the One, true light of this world—the sun pales in comparison to the light of His presence. Even darkness is not dark to Him (Psalm 139:11-12).\n\nI light a candle and the room, once dark, is light again.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

I know He’s the only hope for those who are adrift from His love and truth. And yet, when it’s time to share the gospel, sometimes my palms start to sweat.\n\nWhat if I take a detour off the Romans Road?\n\nWhat if I create more confusion than clarity?\n\nWhat if I get snagged on questions about the finer points of propitiation?\n\nWhat then?\n\nTucked here in John 9, we find a remarkable story about hope, healing, and the beautiful simplicity of the gospel. At the center of the story is a man born blind. Surely, every time he glanced toward something his eyes could not see, he was reminded of his brokenness and need for a Healer. \n\nWhen we come face to face with our inability to be holy as God is holy, or to “fix” ourselves, we realize our need for a Savior. We try to go a day without sinning and fail before our feet hit the floor, once again realizing just how broken we are.\n\nThen the God who healed this man’s eyes lifts ours.\n\nAfter his miraculous healing, the man is pressed by the religious establishment about his encounter with Jesus. He doesn’t debate the points of the Law, or drop a truth bomb, leaving the room in stunned silence. He simply tells his story. Pay attention. It sounds like the chorus of one of the Church’s sweetest anthems.\n\nHe answered, “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.”\n\n– John 9:25\n\nThis man didn’t have Jesus all figured out. He couldn’t explain a God willing to break tradition on the Sabbath He created. He couldn’t reconcile the Pharisees’ perception of God with the reality of his encounter with Jesus, but he did know one thing: “I was blind. Now I see.” He was preaching the gospel. \n\nWhatever else the gospel is, it most certainly is this: “I am a great sinner and Christ is a great Savior.” \n\nThose words were penned by John Newton, writer of the hymn “Amazing Grace.” What the blind man said before the Pharisees, Newton transformed into an anthem for the ages. He cuts to the quick of both our deep need and our source of hope. Like dead eyes revealed this man’s need for a healer, our sin reveals our need for a Savior. Both needs are met Jesus in alone.\n\nThe Pharisees simply could not stand against the undeniable testimony of the the man who had been healed. So radical was his transformation that his friends and neighbors declared him a changed man, “No, he only looks like him” (John 9:9).\n\nFriends, the gospel is not a treasure to be hoarded. The call on each of our lives is to shout it from every rooftop, whisper it in every coffee shop, declare it to every fellow sinner (Matthew 28:16-20). But how? Maybe it’s as simple as Jesus rubbing mud on a blind man’s eyes. \n\nWhen we simply put the story of God’s grace in our own lives on display, we declare, “I was blind. But because of Jesus, now I see.” This is our anthem of hope, and it’s hard to deny hope. We don’t have to have all the answers; our explanations won’t woo others to Jesus. But the aroma of Christ Jesus in us will. It’s His healing presence in our own lives that draws the lost and the blind to the One who brings healing.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

Along with my two sisters and my mother, we followed my dad from station to station, Army base to Army base. We moved every few years from the time I was born until the time my father retired when I was sixteen years old. It was an adventure, a privilege, and at times, it was the worst. We didn’t get to follow orders when we wanted to; we followed them when they were given.\n\nWhen I think about my life as a Christian, I often assume it’s going to be like my life as an Army brat: God gives the orders; I follow. His leadership is cold, indifferent, and ultimately, His orders exist to serve His purposes alone, not my good. My feelings, fears, and preferences aren’t considered. I am not consulted; I am told, sent, and left to deal with the emotional fallout on my own. \n\n With that picture as my guide, my feelings toward God become a deadly cocktail of fear, hurt, and distrust. I’m left wondering if He even loves me.\n\nThankfully, through Scripture, God gives us an entirely different picture of how He leads us in this life. And that picture, time and time again, is not of a cold General leading unsuspecting troops into battle, but of a Good Shepherd tending to His flock, caring for their needs, guiding their grazing.\n\nI have to admit, I couldn’t tell you the last time I saw a sheep in a field. But a little internet detective work revealed this: sheep rely heavily on their incredible range of peripheral vision—they can even see behind them without turning their heads. But their depth perception is so poor, they literally cannot see what lies right in front of their noses.\n\nI can say with conviction that these things are true of me, too. It’s easy for me to look to the past behind me, and to the side at what other people are doing. But when I look out in front of me, everything is incredibly hazy. If I’m honest, most of the time, I have no idea where I’m going.\n\nGod knows this about me. He knows I have a weak sense of vision, and so He guides me with His voice. He speaks in many ways, and even when I fear He is silent, Scripture reminds me of just how near He really is: providing for me, leading, renewing, and comforting me (Psalm 23).\n\nThis is the love of the Good Shepherd in action. With Scripture as my guide, I can see God as He truly is. I can learn from the posture of the sheep: I can follow and rest. I can take in beauty and comfort, even in seemingly dark times. I can love the Shepherd, and trust that no one will ever snatch me from His hands (John 10:28).\n\nThere are times when I’d still prefer to follow a god who sends orders via envelope or email, telling me explicitly where to go and what to do next. But that’s not real relationship. The direction and assurance I seek—that each of us need—are found solely in Jesus, the Shepherd-God. \n\nWe move toward Him, not only because we want to, but because He is the only Way. His voice is the only one we were meant to follow.\n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nText: John 11:1-57, Daniel 12:2-3, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-14\n\nJohn’s Gospel invites readers to “come and see”—not just to hear Christ’s words, but to engage with Him, to “come and see” who Christ is. This was the way of Christ Himself. When His followers had questions, when they were troubled about the world, Christ invited them to come and see the answer: Him.\n\nWhat is the answer to sin, death and darkness? Christ. Won’t you come and see? \n\nThe phrase “come and see” appears four times in the Gospel of John, and the pattern that appears is this: when we see Christ and what He has to offer, we see life, but when we see what man offers, we see death.\n\n“Come and you’ll see,” He replied. So they went and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day. It was about 10 in the morning (John 1:39).\n\n“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Nathanael asked him. “Come and see,” Philip answered (John 1:46).\n\n“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did! Could this be the Messiah?” (John 4:29).\n\nIn all three instances above, we are invited to “come and see” Christ as the Messiah, to see what He is doing. In contrast, when we focus on what we see in the world, all we’ll find is death and darkness.\n\nIn John 11:34, Jesus asks after his friend Lazarus, saying, “Where have you put him?” “Lord,” they tell Him, “come and see.” But this “come and see” doesn’t point to Christ; instead it points to death.\n\nDeath is all this world has to offer. The only solution to sin and darkness is Christ Jesus. When Christ bids us “come and see,” He shows us life. When the world bids us “come and see,” we find a man laid in a tomb. We find death. \n\nThe next verse, verse 35, tells us that “Jesus wept” for his friend Lazarus. Death has struck a blow, and Jesus weeps to see sin and its consequences in a fallen world. But His tears are not an indication of defeat. Instead, there at Lazarus’s tomb, Christ wages war on death, arresting the powers of death and decay, and reversing them. \n\n“I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in Me, even if he dies, will live. Everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die—ever. Do you believe this?”\n\n– John 11:25-26\n\nThe raising of Lazarus from the dead is a foreshadowing of Christ’s work on the cross, which will come just a short time later (John 19-21). Defeating death once and for all, Jesus Himself is raised from the dead. This time, it is Mary Magdalene who weeps, while looking for the body of her Lord. Jesus asks what she is seeking, then simply calls her by name: “Mary” (John 20:16). He’s calling us too (Isaiah 43:1).\n\nWe have seen who Christ is. The light has come. “Life was in Him, and that life was the light of men” (John 1:4). The invitation is no longer just to “come and see,” but to follow Him, to walk with Him (John 8:12). Now that we have seen the light, we are called to abide in it and bear witness to its power and goodness. \n\nBehold Christ, the light of life. Love Him. Walk with Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: John 12:1-50, Psalm 118:25-26, Isaiah 6:10, Isaiah 53:1\n\nThere’s an old church joke that the answer to every question in Sunday school is “Jesus.” As I am trying to teach my boys the gospel, I’ve realized how true this is. The answer to almost every major question really is Jesus.\n\nUnfortunately, one of my sons has a terrible time remembering names. Our conversations might go a little something like this:\n\nMe: Who came to save us?\n\nMy boy: God!\n\nMe: Who died on the cross for our sins?\n\nMy boy: God!\n\nMe: And what’s God’s other name?\n\nMy boy: [Silence]\n\nI’m constantly wondering how he can possibly forget the Great Sunday School Answer. But when I read through John chapter 12, I’m see he’s not the only one.\n\nModern culture often wants to distance Jesus from God, to turn Jesus into a great teacher or a prophet. If He were just a good teacher, a great man—anything but the Son of God, and God incarnate—then we could pick and choose from what He said. We wouldn’t have to submit to Him.\n\nWhen we read the New Testament we see this is not just a figment of modern culture; it was a part of first-century culture, too. The religious elite attacked Jesus for blasphemy because they understood that He was claiming to be God. They knew what Jesus meant when He said He was God’s “only Son” (John 3:16), doing His Father’s will (John 6:38). Up until that point, no one else would have dared to call God their “Father” (John 5:18).\n\nIn this chapter, we again see Jesus fulfilling His calling as the Son of God: speaking life to all who will listen, shining light in the darkness, and bringing glory to God the Father. We even catch a glimpse of the relationship between God the Father and God the Son, as Jesus wrestles with what’s to come:\n\n“Now My soul is troubled. What should I say—Father, save Me from this hour? But that is why I came to this hour. Father, glorify Your name!” \n\nThen a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again!” (John 12:27-28).\n\nIt is a precious insight into the Trinity, our relational God. He has come at great cost to Himself in order to seek relationship with us, offering us the resurrection and the life. \n\nNo wonder Mary was led to worship Him. No wonder the Greeks wanted to see Jesus (John 12:20). No wonder the crowd sang, “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord” (Matthew 23:39). God—Jesus—truly is the answer to our most important questions, the remedy for our greatest fears.\n\nCarolyn Denny dabbled in the Navy, politics, business, and publishing before she discovered her true calling: household management (or so it seems as she raises three boys and a baby girl with her husband, Josh).

What comes out of our mouths when life squeezes us in its vise grip is the stuff we’re really made of. \n\nAt the Last Supper, we find Jesus in the tightest situation imaginable. He knows unthinkable suffering is right around the corner. Since His disciples are still presuming He is going to lead a government takeover, it’s a burden He must carry alone. Jesus knows there will be no military coup. He will secure the Kingdom victory, but through suffering—not conquest. \n\nIn that crucible of suffering, the real Jesus shines through. We don’t catch one hint of self-pity or bitterness in His words or actions. He would soon be poured out on our behalf, yet Jesus remained faithful to who He is and what He came to do.\n\nHe never stopped teaching. Using bread and wine for an object lesson of cosmic consequences, Jesus taught truths in advance that His disciples would not grasp until He was gone (John 12:16). As modern Christ followers, we have access to this Upper Room as a classroom. We’re able to wrestle with the lessons of His atoning sacrifice every time we come to take communion. \n\nHe never stopped serving. Knowing that within hours His own would be nailed to a tree, Jesus took the time to wash His disciples’ feet. “So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done for you” (John 13:14-15). This moment wasn’t mere ritual. Jesus was showing them how to care for one another after He departed.\n\nHe never stopped loving. When I study the Last Supper, I am most grateful for this truth: “Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end” (John 13:1). To the end. Our Savior never stopped loving the undeserving, helpless sinners He came to die for. He never chose hatred or contempt. He didn’t shame or ostracize Judas, the one who would sell Him out for a few silver coins. Instead of pointing His finger at him, Jesus offered him bread.\n\nWhen hard-pressed on every side, Jesus never resented the sacrifice He chose to make on our behalf. It was in His suffering that our Savior displayed His true strength.\n\n“But he was pierced because of our rebellion,\n\ncrushed because of our iniquities;\n\npunishment for our peace was on him,\n\nand we are healed by his wounds.”\n\n– Isaiah 53:5\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

Sometimes even a small decision can lead to an overwhelming list of pros and cons. In my heart of hearts, I know I want pizza for dinner, but maybe I should want the soup, or the salad… or the chicken. You’d think dinner would be a simpler decision. (The answer is pizza. Always choose the pizza!) When it’s so easy to complicate the tiniest of decisions, how do we come to any sense of peace and assurance about the bigger matters in life?\n\nThe Christian faith is simple and complicated at the same time. We are called to have faith like a child (Matthew 18:3), and also to grow toward maturity (Hebrews 6:1). In some places the Word of God seems so straightforward, and yet the psalmist declared some knowledge too wonderful and lofty to grasp (Psalm 139:6). The seeming contradiction between this simplicity and complexity speaks to the mystery of the gospel. But when it comes to our salvation, Jesus doesn’t want there to be any confusion.\n\nIt’s funny—and oddly reassuring—just how human the disciples were. By the time we come to John 14, they were well into their ministry alongside the Son of God. You would think after all the miracles and face-to-face teachings from Jesus, they would have learned the basics. But when Jesus talked about the way to heaven, the disciples seemed totally and utterly confused!\n\nSo, once again, He spoke clearly, telling them:\n\n“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. If you know Me, you will also know My Father. From now on you do know Him and have seen Him.”\n\n– John 14:6-7\n\nJesus spells it out for His disciples—and for us, too—so that there can be no misunderstanding. He is the way to freedom. He is truth and life.\n\nThere are parts of our faith that are truly complex because we love and serve an infinite God. There are some questions that don’t have simple answers. The gospel is like an intricately woven tapestry, with threads intertwining in hidden places, forming the most epic story of all time. God gives us minds to think and question and analyze these mysteries with humility, so that we might grow in our understanding and love.\n\nBut, some parts of the Word are crystal clear. \n\nJesus came to our world in the form of a man so that His followers could see, know, and touch the love of their Father. In a world full of confusion, God wants His people to know exactly who He is.\n\nIf you know Jesus, you know the Creator of all and the way to salvation. As you “work out your salvation with fear and trembling” (Philippians 2:12), may you find peace in the straightforward declarations and promises of our Lord.\n\n",

(Three compartments! You can understand my sadness.)\n\nAnd here, in John chapter 15, Jesus says this:\n\n“Remain in me, and I in you. Just as a branch is unable to produce fruit by itself unless it remains on the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without me”\n\n(vv. 4-5, emphasis mine). \n\nThis is what He says. But do you know what I hear? I hear, “Bear fruit.” Or, to be more specific, “Hey, you, why aren’t you bearing fruit?” I, the Queen of Focusing On The Wrong Things, read Jesus’ words and hear all of the goal and none of the grace. I want the end but forget the means.\n\nYes, bear fruit. Yes, love others. Yes, give grace to a world that will misunderstand and even hate us. But look back through John 15. Jesus is not commanding His disciples to bear fruit. The command is to remain. When we remain—when we abide in the never-ending, unconditional, forever love of Christ—then the fruit will come. \n\nWe bear fruit when, and only when, we are grafted into the True Vine. His Holy Spirit in us is the fruit producer; we are simply the branches who have the privilege of displaying His fruit.\n\nJesus Christ comes to make us new. He comes to redeem the dead branches that we are and give us abundant life! Remaining in Him—resting, dwelling, abiding in Him—is the only source of our strength, our goodness, our fruit. \n\nLet’s focus our eyes on the True Vine today. Let’s be about the business of remaining in Jesus, and trust His Spirit to be about the business of bearing fruit in our lives. \n\nLord, teach us what it means to remain when all we want to do is produce. Help us to rest in your never-stopping love. Amen.\n\n",

They know my name here. They welcome me in the door, ask how my writing is going, and never give me the slant-eye when my coffee goes cold, while I continue to suck electricity from their walls and Wi-Fi out of their air. Here, it’s easy to pretend that life is all lattes and progress.\n\nBut the reality is, everyone around me is experiencing their own pain. The girl who stops by my table just had a miscarriage. The grey-haired man eating his oatmeal while reading the paper just lost his wife last year. The exhausted, lonely mother at the register keeps trying to order her coffee, but stops to run out the door after her two-year-old escape artist. The newspaper sitting next to me screams its headlines of tragedy: War Rages On! Politicians Still Lie! Poverty Eats Away at the Hungry!\n\nWe’re all acquainted with our own brand of heartache. It’s enough to bring you to the same conclusion as Solomon in Ecclesiastes: “I observed everything going on under the sun, and really, it is all meaningless—like chasing the wind” (Ecclesiastes 1:14).\n\nThis view of suffering is the fare the world offers up to us for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The world tells us that if we’re hurting, it’s up to us to change our circumstances so we won’t hurt anymore. We’re to follow our heart, chase our dreams, and forsake everything—even our responsibilities, family, and God— in order to secure our own happiness in the world. But in the midst of all that noise, Jesus provides a much different view of suffering. \n\nWith some of His last words to His disciples, Jesus predicted that trouble was coming. He said they would be kicked out of the temple—losing the social center of their lives (Luke 21:5-6). They would be ostracized, killed, and separated from one another. But most importantly, He told them to expect these things, to not be surprised when they happened. Grief would be a part of their experience here on earth, just as it’s a part of ours. \n\nBut Jesus doesn’t leave us in our sorrow. He promises to turn our grief into joy (John 16:20). He tells us we’re to have courage because He’s already conquered the evil in this world (John 16:33)—and, in fact, He’s making us a new one (Isaiah 65:17).\n\nThe world tells us to break free from grief because our time here is limited. Jesus invites us to welcome our grief as the precursor to eternity. In that way, our pain is not a state of being that needs to be avoided; it is an access point to the throne of God.\n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

I feel upside-down in my sadness. Have you ever felt this way? Honestly, I wonder who hasn’t. What is your heart aching for today as you read these verses in John 17?\n\nSometimes when I find myself in the depths, cracking my Bible open is the last thing I want to do. But for some reason, today, I craved falling into Scripture. I felt that God had something for me here, in this passage. And oh, how rich this passage is, especially for the aching heart.\n\nThe hour had come for our Savior. As I read His prayer, I can almost feel His aching, His longing to protect those who’ve come to believe in Him. As He anticipated the events to come, He pleaded with the Father for the disciples He loved:\n\n“Now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to You, Holy Father, keep through Your name those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We are.”\n\n-John 17:11\n\nCan you imagine being in the presence of Christ as He is praying for you? Sitting in the same room with Him, hearing Him say just before, “in this world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world,” and then watching Jesus turn His eyes heavenward and, in prayer, put your life and soul into the Father’s care?\n\nWhen I read Jesus’ prayer today, something cracked open. I felt the fervent love He has for me, the fervent love He has for us all. Right after He prayed for the disciples, He prayed for those who will believe (John 17:20). Jesus prayed for you, and He prayed for me, too—for all who would come to trust in Him.\n\nHe knew this world. He lived it, walked it, saw the desperation and the brokenness. He knew what it would mean for us to be here—that we would face a seemingly endless stream of trial and tribulation. Knowing what was to come for His disciples and for who would believe, He said:\n\n“I am not praying\n\nthat You take them out of the world\n\nbut that You protect them from the evil one.”\n\n-John 17:15\n\nHe did not pray for our suffering to end, or for the pain and sorrow to cease. Instead, He prayed for our protection as we face these trials and circumstances. He prayed that we would not face them alone, but with the support of our community and our God.\n\n“May they all be one,\n\nas You, Father, are in Me and I am in You.\n\nMay they also be one in Us,\n\nso the world may believe You sent Me.”\n\n-John 17:21\n\nThe idea that Jesus is not only near us, but in us—not only for us, but a part of us—brings comfort to my heart as nothing else can. “I in them, and You in Me” (v. 23)—this is His will for the Church.\n\nWhatever you face today, we as believers are one in Him, and this oneness tells the world of the glory of God. Perhaps that is why writing this has felt so healing for me: it has reminded me that I am not alone in heartache. We are all still in this world, though not of it, and whether it is joy or suffering that binds us, God is glorified in our unity.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: John 18:1-40, Daniel 7:14\n\nThe hour Jesus was born for had finally come. He’d been predicting it, waiting for it, knowing what it would require of Him: arrest, pain, and death. For anyone else, this would be a crisis moment, to be sure. For the Son of God, it was an opportunity for the most profound display of obedience, love, and humility ever known.\n\nJohn’s account of this night shows us the holiness of Jesus, God incarnate—deliberate, powerful, wise, and gentle. Put simply, He is not of this world. But the people surrounding Him? They proved themselves to be oh-so very human.\n\nAt this point, Judas’ secret sin had finally consumed him. All those months on the road—stealing from the disciples’ treasury, betraying his friends—had prepared him for this moment, and he intended to capitalize on it. Jesus responded as only He can: by declaring His deity, revealing His glory, and protecting His disciples. And even as He submitted to His arrest, Jesus gave Judas one last chance to see His true identity.\n\nPeter was a man of action, refusing to sit around and wait for Jesus to die. He followed his heart, despite Jesus’ teaching and example—despite knowing better. First, he sliced off the soldier’s ear to protect his Lord, then he denied Jesus altogether. His Savior’s response was not one of condemnation, but of grace. He protected Peter, gently rebuked him, and restored him (John 21). He continued to build Peter’s faith, even in His darkest hours.\n\nAnnas was one of the richest, most powerful Jews of his time. There was no way he’d be willing to let some upstart from the outskirts destroy everything he’d spent a lifetime building. Believing Jesus was leading the people away from his agenda, Annas had no problem breaking a few laws to get rid of Him. But Jesus had nothing to hide, no secret life to reveal. So He turned the tables on Annas, subtly challenging the leader’s interrogation of Him (which had been done in secret, and therefore, was against their civil laws). \n\nAs for Pilate, he’d learned not to interfere in Jewish matters and had become skilled at shifting responsibility. To him, this was a Jewish problem for the Jews to work out amongst themselves. But to Jesus, this wasn’t just a Jewish issue but a human one, an eternal one. It was about a Kingdom impacting the whole world and beyond, a Kingdom rooted in Truth.\n\nIn this series of events, John’s Gospel makes one thing clear: our Savior is fundamentally different from this world. His response is never fed by deception or greed or fear, but rather by an otherworldly compassion for His people and command over all circumstances. He will always accomplish His gracious plan, often in unforeseeable ways.\n\nLike the events in John 18, life can seem like one long, dark night, leaving us feeling betrayed, wounded, and scared. It’s easy to relate to Peter’s impulse to fix the situation, or Pilate’s attempts to distance himself from it. But then I see Jesus walking into the darkness, knowing all there is to fear, yet bolstered by confidence in the Father’s plan to rescue all who love Him. \n\nIt’s tempting, perhaps even good, to feel inspired by Christ’s example. But I’m finding I don’t always have the wherewithal to follow Jesus’ lead. I need to lean on Him, push against Him, knowing He will never falter or fail. Seeing His response to such an array of broken people is healing and soul-nourishing for me, a sinner. Our Savior was gentle, trustworthy, and sovereign on the darkest night in history, and He will be so with us today, even now.\n\nCarolyn Denny dabbled in the Navy, politics, business, and publishing before she discovered her true calling: household management.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: John 19:1-42, John 20:1-31, 1 Peter 2:22-25, Psalm 22:1-8\n\nMy kids learned to fly kites this weekend. \n\nAfter much trial and error (and a fair amount of weeping and gnashing of teeth), all three of them experienced that exhilarating payoff of the kite string pulling tight in their hand and the wind lifting the cheap, plastic diamond high in the happy, flappy breeze. They stood outside for hours—5 hours, come to think of it—watching their kites soar in the air. They flew kites while singing songs. They flew kites while dancing. They flew kites while running in circles and they even flew kites while lying down. My personal favorite? When they flew kites while singing AND lying down.\n\nAs I sat on a blanket and watched the event unfold, it reminded me of a Billy Graham quote about the wind. You fellow youth group kids of the early 90’s know the one; I’m pretty sure it was spliced into the beginning of a DC Talk song: “Can you see God? You haven’t seen him? I’ve never seen the wind. I see the effects of the wind, but I’ve never seen the wind. There’s a mystery to it.”\n\nBelieving in what we cannot see can be downright hard. Even those who walked the earth with Jesus wanted to see more of Him in order to believe or hold onto belief. The crowds followed Him, pushing in closer and longing to catch a real, live glimpse of the Messiah in action.\n\nMary Magdalene was one who followed Jesus faithfully. Even after His death she went to the tomb, anxious to see the body of her Savior; and when He wasn’t there, she wept. \n\nMary needed to see Jesus. Then He appeared to her there where she knelt crying, and she saw Him and believed! \n\nThe disciple Thomas heard the news that Jesus had risen from the dead. “We have seen the Lord,” the others told him (John 20:24). But Thomas was a doubter, like I’m prone to be. \n\nThomas needed to touch Jesus. “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe” (v. 25). And Thomas touched his hands to Jesus’ hands and believed!\n\nWe can understand our sister Mary and our brother Thomas, can’t we? In the hurry and sorrow and uncertainty of this life, we need a hope we can see and feel. But unlike Mary, we don’t get to see Jesus face to face. And unlike Thomas, we don’t get to put our fingers on His nail-scarred hands. Yes, we can see God’s mercy at work in the world, making broken things new. We can feel the Holy Spirit changing our hearts, softening what once was stone. But the darkest valleys leave our eyes and hands searching for something we can’t seem to find. \n\nJesus knew this would be hard for us. It’s why He gives us faith—to believe. Paul tells us faith is a gift, not something we muster up on our own (Ephesians 2:8). And Jesus calls those who have it blessed (John 20:29). He has also given us His very Spirit to live within us (John 14:26), and His Word to guide us (Psalm 119:105). Though we can’t yet lay eyes on Christ, He lays His hand of mercy on us by the indwelling of His Spirit and the gift of His Word. \n\nThere will be times when we struggle to believe what we cannot see. But the risen Savior is ever near, as alive as He was the day He spoke to a distraught Mary, and the day He beckoned Thomas to touch His side. When we have trouble seeing Him in our lives, we can see Him here, in the pages of His Word. \n\n",

My brain was so clouded by pregnancy hormones and sleep deprivation that I didn’t know what I needed or how to ask for help. \n\nSo Mandy made me pancakes. \n\nMandy and I weren’t friends, exactly. We mostly smiled at each other in the halls of our church, but she called me one evening with this invitation: “Come over tomorrow morning, first thing. Bring your little guy and stay in your jammies. I’m going to make you pancakes.”\n\nNot typically the kind of gal to show up at a stranger’s house in my jammies, I’m surprised I accepted her offer. I’m usually more of a “spiff everything up and look like you have it together” kind of girl. Even so, the next morning we headed over to Mandy’s in our comfies. \n\nThose were the best pancakes of my life. Food eaten on dishes I didn’t have to wash was a lifeline of sorts. That moment of simple compassion stuck with me long after I cleaned (okay fine, licked) my plate and headed home. \n\nYears later I was surprised to find a similar story in John 21. \n\nAfter a night of fruitless fishing to punctuate the best and worst months of their lives, Peter, James, John, and a handful of other disciples found themselves staring out at the same waves Jesus had walked upon. Everything had changed since then. Jesus had been arrested, crucified, and buried. Their hopes were dashed and they scattered, fearing for their lives. Peter’s grief was compounded by the agonizing memory that he denied the Savior not once, not twice, but three times. \n\nAlmost immediately after everything went so terribly wrong, Jesus started setting it right again. His death was trumped by His resurrection. His scared disciples were refocused by His return. Even Peter’s denials got reversed. \n\nJesus called His fishing friends to the shore. Peter was so anxious to be with his Savior that he jumped right out of the boat fully clothed (John 21:7). When they got to shore, they found that Jesus had made them breakfast. It was a simple gesture that demonstrated profound care and compassion. In His glorified state, Jesus tenderly met His friends’ physical needs before offering an even better portion. \n\nDuring a post-breakfast stroll, Jesus gave Peter not one, not two, but three chances to declare his love. For every denial, Peter got to make a proclamation (John 21:15-17). Though sinned against, Jesus initiated reconciliation and offered tender mercies. \n\nIn this last chapter of John’s Gospel, we see the risen Christ doing more of what He’d done all along: love and serve, invite and forgive. In fact, John ends his account of Jesus’ life by stating there were so many more things that Jesus did, “if they were written one by one, I suppose not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written” (John 21:25). Volume after volume of love and service. Book after book of invitation and forgiveness. \n\nPerhaps emulating Jesus is simpler than we think. Offer grace. Pursue reconciliation. Forgive freely. Whenever possible, love others well by serving them. Pancakes optional.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 1:1-17, 2 Samuel 7:12-16, 2 Corinthians 5:17\n\nIf you could have access to only one book for the rest of your life, which would you choose? \n\nJudging from their devoted habits and bold commentary, it seems a great many theological giants in Church history would have made Romans their go-to text for a lifetime. Early church father John Chrysostom had the book read aloud to him once a week. Poet and preacher Samuel Taylor Coleridge called it “the profoundest piece of writing in existence.” The famous sixteenth-century Bible translator William Tyndale wrote of Romans, “It is the principal and most excellent part of the New Testament… No man can read it too oft.” Martin Luther, St. Augustine, and John Wesley all came to assured faith through the impact of Romans.\n\nWhat is it about this book that has captivated the attention of believers across the ages? What makes Romans so unique? \n\nAll Scripture is God-breathed and equally valuable—God’s special revelation given to us that we might know Him. But Romans is distinct in that it provides the most comprehensive expression of the gospel found in the Bible. This book reaches back deep into the Old Testament to walk us through the origin and problem of sin, the reality of guilt, and the impossibility of saving ourselves. And it presents, systematically yet succinctly, the ultimate rescue we’re given in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn short, Romans contains the essential gospel.\n\nFrom the opening statements of his letter, Paul makes clear his purpose for writing: to present and promote the gospel of Jesus Christ. He introduces himself as Christ’s servant, “set apart for the gospel of God” (Romans 1:1). He addresses the letter to “all who are in Rome, loved by God,” expressing his commitment to telling them “the good news about [God’s] Son” (vv.7-9). And he conveys how desperately he has desired to visit the city personally: “I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome” (v.15).\n\nPaul then turns from his brief introduction to make a stunningly clear pronouncement on where he stands when it comes to the message of Christ:\n\nFor I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.\n\n– Romans 1:16\n\nPaul was confident in his calling to preach the gospel because he was certain of the saving power of his God. I am a servant of Christ… I am an apostle… I am set apart for the gospel… I am eager to preach the good news… I am not ashamed. \n\nIt is with this unshakeable confidence that Paul, the self-proclaimed “worst of sinners” (1 Timothy 1:15), wrote to the believers at Rome—to explain to Jewish and Gentile converts alike what it means to believe in and be redeemed by Jesus Christ. For this is no metaphorical salvation; it is the real-life rescue of broken and complicated people by the all-powerful hand of a merciful God.\n\nLean in close as Paul presents his longest letter in Scripture, a sermon on what it means to be a Christ follower in this life. Listen as he tells of God’s holiness, justice, and compassion. Read this book as though it is telling a single story—the story of how God rescues us through the sacrifice of Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 1:18-32, Proverbs 1:7, 2 Timothy 3:1-9\n\nIn all of Paul’s letters, there are few bleaker passages than the one we encounter in Romans 1:18-32. Here Paul paints a picture of total depravity, gleeful rebellion, and blind rejection of God—all of which incur the deserved wrath of God. It’s dark and it’s grim, but there is one thing you especially need to know about it:\n\nIt’s your story.\n\nIf you’re like me, that might sound strange. Like many lifelong Christians, I was raised in the church, a rule-following “good girl” who never colored outside the lines. My life looks nothing like Paul’s portrait of self-destruction. And yet, his language is intentionally vague. He never specifies who this passage is about. Scholars have speculated—perhaps it’s about Adam and Eve, or perhaps he is describing non-Christians. But most scholars, like Dr. Douglas Moo, a professor at Wheaton College, interpret his words more broadly: “[Paul] has in view human beings generally, prone to turn away from God because of the original fall into sin.” \n\nIn other words, this passage is about us. \n\nPaul speaks of the “godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth”—the people who struggle with “envy, murder, quarrels, deceit, and malice” (vv.18, 29). And those people he’s describing? Well, they’re us—all of us. Paul isn’t singling out a particular group of people; he’s diagnosing the human condition. \n\nLeft to our own devices, sin distorts our souls like water-warped wood. For every human ever born, that is our story. At least, it would have been our story had God not intervened.\n\nWhat we see in Romans 1:18-32 is a vision of our fate, had God not planned our rescue. Without God’s grace we were all “by nature deserving of wrath” (Ephesians 2:3). To understand exactly what these harsh words mean, we must be careful not to confuse God’s “wrath” with human forms of anger. Theologian John Stott describes human anger as “irrational and uncontrollable emotion, containing much vanity, animosity, malice, and the desire for revenge.” God’s wrath, on the other hand, “is absolutely free of all such poisonous ingredients.” \n\nBy comparison, God’s wrath is His “holy hostility to evil.” This hostility is not arbitrary. God does not pick rules out of a hat, and smite those who fail to conform. No, God directs His hostility squarely at the destructive effects of sin. Sin steals, kills, and destroys everything it touches, including the crown jewel of His creation: humankind. It degrades and dismantles us, and God’s response to this cosmic terrorism is total opposition. God opposes sin because He is good and righteous and just. \n\nHe also opposes it because of His love. Like a father’s white-knuckle rage at his son’s addiction, or a mother’s howling grief at her daughter’s eating disorder, God’s wrath is an expression of His love. It is hostility towards that which devours His children whole.\n\nThis side of eternity, we may never understand the mysterious balance between God’s active condemnation and the natural consequences of human sin. But together, these two elements constitute God’s righteous wrath against all human sin. That is our story—every one of us. Apart from the grace of God, we would only choose death. \n\nWhenever we read these words, we must ask the Spirit to reveal ourselves within them, because we cannot have the good news without the bad news. We cannot call it “salvation” if we are not being saved from something—namely, ourselves. Self-ruin is the only place our sin will ever take us. But, thanks to Jesus, it doesn’t have to.\n\n\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

Confusion filled her dark brown eyes. “I don’t understand,” she said.\n\nI explained further. “The Chinese and Japanese character used to translate ‘sin’ is the word zui, which means ‘crime.’”\n\nShe nodded and motioned for me to continue.\n\n“I think that translation can be somewhat limiting. I imagine you haven’t really spent time in jail or committed a crime like robbing a bank. I imagine you consider yourself a pretty good person.”\n\nShe nodded again. \n\n“I used to think of myself as a pretty good person, too” I said. “But then someone asked, if a movie were made of my life, if there were certain scenes I’d want deleted. I knew exactly which scenes I didn’t want anyone to see. And these scenes were not just of the times I did things I knew I shouldn’t, but also when I didn’t do things I knew I should. Our sin problem shows itself in both ways—in the things we do and the things we don’t do. We all sin. No one lives a life free of scenes they wouldn’t want others to see.”\n\nPaul goes to great lengths in the first three chapters of Romans to help us understand the totality and consequences of our sin. He lists the manifestations of sin at the end of chapter one, then goes on to explain how his readers not only judge others, but also practice the very things for which they pass judgment. \n\nAnd it’s true: most of us consider ourselves “good” people, qualified to judge others for their many shortcomings—that is, until we place our own sin-plagued lives next to Christ’s righteousness. Jesus is the only one who lived a perfect, God-honoring, shame-free life. \n\nBoth Jews and Gentiles—and both you and I—fall short under God’s holy judgment. We are all guilty, often of the very same things for which we condemn others. But there is good news: \n\nFor God loved the world in this way. He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.\n\n– John 3:16\n\nWe are born spiritually dead, our sin separating us from a life with God. But God, in the person of Jesus Christ, has made a way for us to know Him, both in this earthly life and for all eternity (John 17:3). \n\nJust as God Himself provides the way for us to be reconciled to Him, He also does the work of revealing to us our sin—of showing us how our “goodness” falls short of His righteousness. The Holy Spirit does the convicting (John 16:8), which frees us to love and to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15).\n\nIn Romans, Paul writes systematically to knock away our sense of ever being righteous in and of ourselves. God’s invitation is not to mere ethics or manufactured goodness, but to the utter, complete transformation that takes place when we are made new in Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nMay God melt away our pride that keeps us from total dependence on Him. By His grace, may we love others, even as they fall short like we also do. And may we recognize and receive God’s kindness that leads us to repentance.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 2:17-29, Deuteronomy 7:25-26, Psalm 51:1-12\n\nIn one of my seminary classes, we were to read Athanasius’ On the Incarnation, as well as— according to the syllabus—the book’s preface written by C.S. Lewis. Paying close attention to the syllabus (thought not that close), I read both the preface and the introduction.\n\nA few weeks later, during his lecture, the professor pointed out that we technically didn’t have to read the book’s introduction, but he said if we’d been smart, we would have. He explained this had been his intention—even if the syllabus hadn’t spelled it out explicitly.\n\nWas he assuming we were mind readers? Not really. He just had expectations. \n\nAt some point, we all give instructions—to colleagues, to children, to friends, to husbands—that may not be perfect or exact, but we hope the recipient will pick up on our intent, on the spirit of what we’re asking them to do. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t. \n\nPaul is giving a similar instruction here to the Jewish Christians in Rome. He is echoing Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, asking Jesus’ followers to read deeper into the Law. Paul tells them it’s not about following the letter of the law. It’s about following the heart of the One who wrote it. \n\nPaul’s laundry list of law-breaking activities in verses 21-23, reads similarly to what Jesus said in Matthew 5:\n\nYou have heard that it was said to those of old, “You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.” But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment.\n\n– Matthew 5:21-22\n\nJesus preached these words to some who knew the Law backwards and forwards, but He was holding up a magnifying glass to their hearts. They weren’t out murdering people—they were law-following Jews, after all—but what was going on in their hearts? Were they angry with their brother? Jesus said then they, too, are deserving of punishment. The spirit of the Law was broken, even if the exact rule was not. \n\nPaul does the same for his readers. He questions their obedience to the Law, but then he reminds them it’s the posture of their hearts that matters most. These proud Jewish Christians came from a long heritage of trying to earn righteousness by following the Law. They too easily forgot that Jesus came to fulfill the Law for them, to make them righteous by simply believing in Him. \n\nIt’s not hard to see myself in the Jewish Christians of Rome, slipping back into trying to follow the rules rather than the One who wrote them. It’s easy to think my righteousness comes from  acting the right way, rather than from “the Way” Himself (John 14:6). But as the psalmist tells us, “would God not discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart” (Psalm 44:21).\n\nIf I’m honest, what’s going on inside my heart is usually much uglier than how I act on the outside. Thankfully, Jesus came to wash me clean from the inside out. This is the beauty of the cross and the gift of the Holy Spirit: to compel me to seek God’s heart first, and obey His law by the help of His Spirit.\n\n \n\nMelanie Rainer is the director of content for JellyTelly, where she writes and edits family spiritual formation resources.

He lived, died, and rose again for sinners. He forgives sinners. And sinners who place their faith in Him are welcomed into His family.\n\nThat’s really good news for sinners, right? And Scripture leaves no doubt. You, me, and every person on earth… we’re all sinners. That’s the bottom line Paul lays out in Romans 3:23.\n\nWe’re all broken, needy, and messed-up in a way that simply being “good” can never fix.  \n\nSince the Garden of Eden, our identity as humans has been marked by our tendency to rebel against God. That’s why we can never behave our way into a right relationship with Him. The most well-behaved, law-abiding, church-attending, choir-singing, modest-dressing, moralistic person alive, apart from Jesus Christ, is still dead in her trespasses and sins (Eph 2:1).\n\nThe heartbeat of the gospel is not, “Clean up your act, obey the rules, and God will forgive you.” That’s moralism, not Christianity. Any one of us who has ever tried to be a perfect person, even for a day, knows that approach simply doesn’t work. That false gospel stands in direct contradiction to the true one: Christ died for sinners. Because He loves us, remember?\n\nDo we encourage each other—and ourselves—to obedience? Absolutely! But let’s also remember that righteousness does not come through our obedience. Right standing with God comes only through faith in Jesus—His works and not our own. As Paul says in verse 24, “They are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”\n\nThrough Jesus, grace flows freely to sinners. Through Jesus, those guilty and condemned are declared righteous—justified by His sacrifice, by grace through faith. And through Jesus, polluted sinners exchange filthy rags for robes of righteousness.\n\n“I greatly rejoice in the Lord,\n\nI exult in my God;\n\nfor has clothed me with the garments of salvation\n\nand wrapped me in a robe of righteousness… ” (Isaiah 61:10).\n\nCarrie Gaul is a biblical correspondent for Revive Our Hearts. She and her husband Dennis have two married children and are enjoying grandchildren. Carrie has a deep love for God’s Word and a passion to see women grow in ever-increasing intimacy with Jesus through the study and application of His Word.\n\nEditor’s Note: In Romans, Paul is building a case for the good news that is ours in Christ by faith. He uses these early chapters to establish our guilt before God—which he does to establish our need for a Savior. One of the most challenging aspects of the gospel is that it is based on the death and resurrection of Christ, necessitated by our own sin. We cannot understand the depth of God’s love for us in Christ without understanding the depth of our need for that sacrifice and the sin it covers. Because of Jesus, our sin is not counted against us, so we are never just “sinners.” We are redeemed sinners. A new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). What an amazing gift it is to know that “God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).\n\nThis essay was revised on August 28, 2017. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 3:21-31, Ephesians 1:7-10, Colossians 1:13-14\n\nI love a good “before and after.”\n\nWhether it’s watching the last ten minutes of an episode of HGTV’s Fixer Upper or following a designer’s Instagram feed, I just can’t get enough of those visual transformations. Give me all the before-and-after shots of your kitchen, bathroom, closet—even your hair!—magically morphed from cluttered to clean. I never, ever tire of them.\n\nReading Romans 3:21-31 reminds me of my makeover obsession. These verses are all about our “after”—who we are because of God’s grace “by the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (v.24). The power of this passage lies in its contrast to the one before it. What would an “after” photo be if we never saw the “before”?\n\nA beautiful kitchen is a beautiful kitchen. But when we see that kitchen as it once was—dated tile, linoleum floors, and missing cabinet doors—compared to its transformed state of marble countertops and hardwood floors, we appreciate its newness and beauty that much more.\n\nSo let’s back up to Romans 3:20, our “before” shot that says, “For no one will be justified in his sight by the works of the law, because the knowledge of sin comes through the law.” That’s bad news for us. It means all the good stuff we did last week, all the good deeds and hard work—it’s all meaningless in itself.\n\nBut…\n\nBut now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the Law and the Prophets. The righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.\n\n– Romans 3:21-22\n\nThis, friends, is the good news! No, we are not justified by the law, but we are justified in Christ.\n\nGod presented him as an atoning sacrifice in his blood, received through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be righteous and declare righteous the one who has faith in Jesus.\n\n– Romans 3:25-26\n\nNow, imagine knowing this good news with no understanding of the bad news that preceded it. Imagine seeing the “after” without seeing the “before.” It wouldn’t really be good news then, would it? In light of the bad news, the promise found in verses 25-26 is that much brighter, more hopeful. The contrast is everything.\n\nOur before is not a pretty picture. It is devoid of God and, therefore, full of despair. As Paul quoted the Hebrew scriptures, “all have turned away…ruin and wretchedness are in their paths” (Romans 3:12,16).\n\nBut…\n\nThis passage today is our after. The ones who have faith in Jesus are righteous. Not the ones who do the most, achieve the most, or follow the letter of the law the best. Unlike those HGTV makeovers, it’s not the amount of work we put in that brings us from before to after; it’s Christ’s work on the cross that transforms us. He, and He alone, declares us righteous before the one true God.\n\nPerhaps this is why I love seeing visual transformations so much. They help me to remember the gospel’s redemption in my own life. It’s a reminder I desperately need to hear, over and over again. It was not our blood, sweat, and tears that brought us back into relationship with God. It was His.\n\nWe are forever grateful, Jesus.\n\n\n\nAndrea Lucado is a freelance writer, Texas native, and the author of the memoir English Lessons: The Crooked Path of Growing Toward Faith.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 4:1-25, Psalm 32:1-2, Ephesians 2:4-7\n\nLet me tell you what everybody’s talking about these days: kale. I know, first telegrams were all the rage, later to be followed by fast food drive-thrus, “The Electric Slide,” and space travel. But now we’ve finally peaked with an affection for curly leaves that sprout from the ground.\n\nAt first, I really thought I was missing out. Kale seemed to be every celebrity’s best kept secret, every magazine’s healthy choice, and every grocery cart’s consistent companion. So, I tossed a bunch of kale into my produce bag and raced to the checkout line, anxious to taste this treat of the century. In the car, I tore the stem off like a cupcake wrapper, stuffing a handful of leaves into my mouth. I wanted to like it more than anything, but friends, gag reflexes don’t lie.\n\nIn contrast to the controversial kale, it would be difficult to find someone who didn’t like Abraham. His popularity was well-deserved, his reputation flawless, his character impeccable. The Jews looked up to him as a forefather paving the trail of faith, a man whose righteousness, they hoped, would inspire their own. If they were anything like me, they’d stuff themselves silly with anything that promised a chance at gaining his status.\n\nPerhaps some Jews tried to duplicate Abraham’s righteousness with their own try-hard attempts at earning favor with God. But no matter their determination, the results would remain bitter and unsavory. Exhausted, they might look to him and wonder, How does he do it?\n\nI asked the same of my friend Amanda, who eats a salad for lunch every single day and, consequently, is very well versed in the area of all-things-kale. She laughed, explaining that no one eats kale plain. Apparently (you probably already knew this), you drench it in dressing, blend it in a smoothie, or soften it with olive oil. By itself, kale isn’t the star ingredient, but when covered in other flavors, it gets all the credit for being delicious. Abraham’s secret had a similar flavor: “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness” (Romans 4:3).\n\nAt first glance, it’s easy to assume that if anyone could achieve righteousness, it would probably be a guy like Abraham. But like you and me, he had sin pumping through his veins. And so Abraham is not the achiever in this passage—God is. Abraham simply believed God and His promises.\n\nNow to the one who works, pay is not considered as a gift, but as something owed. But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who declares the ungodly to be righteous, his faith is credited for righteousness.\n\n– Romans 4:4-5\n\nHear this good news, friends. Because Christ was righteousness in our place, we, too, are drenched in His goodness, credited with His coveted status—we’re the very fragrance of Christ before our Father (2 Corinthians 2:14). May we always believe with the faith of Abraham, receiving God’s promises with open hands and thankful hearts. Amen.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 5:1-11, Galatians 4:6-7, Ephesians 2:18-22\n\nSeven years ago I found myself so emotionally, physically, and spiritually debilitated that just getting out of bed in the morning was difficult. I’d never struggled with acute depression before, but after soldiering through the deaths of several of my loved ones and a cancer scare of my own, my get-up-and-go was totally gone. All I wanted was to wave a white flag at life and crawl under the covers, venturing out just long enough to grab another pint of ice cream.\n\nIf someone had given me some perky acrostic or suggested I listen to a sermon entitled, “Ten Things Victorious Christians Do to Kick Disappointment and Despair to the Curb,” I’d have kicked them in the shins. Fortunately, Lynn, the Christian counselor I’ve gone to for years, doesn’t prescribe the dangerous meds of “minimizing grief” or “multiplying guilt.” Instead, she was silent as I sobbed, empathetic as I lamented.\n\nLynn gave me this advice: “Cling to Jesus and do the next right thing.” \n\nShe told me to stop trying to tackle the troubles of an entire day, much less a week, month, or year. I was simply to move forward one step at a time. Some days I’d wake to the alarm clock only to be hit with a shock of emotion as I remembered my circumstances. And other days, just whispering the name of our Savior gave me enough grit to pull back the covers and get out of bed.\n\nDay by day, inch by laborious inch, Jesus led me by the hand through that dark valley of life— one step at a time. \n\nI know far too many people who have lost their joy and all but lost their faith in Jesus because endurance was an overlooked muscle group in their Christian vocabulary. And so they’d stop attending Bible study, then church, fading away from their faith community in the midst of their malaise. Some have been wounded by that very same community of believers. Others have simply lost the energy and will to put on a happy face, to pretend their get-up-and-go hasn’t left them too.\n\nSurely our Creator-Redeemer weeps over the gaping holes in the fabric of His covenant family. We weren’t created to be wincing, jaded isolationists. We were created in God’s image, in the image of the triune God who exists in perfect relational harmony with Himself as Father, Son, and Spirit (Genesis 1:26). We’re hardwired for relationship, for communing with others of the faith.\n\nWhen life leaves us disappointed, disillusioned, and despairing, we need to resist the urge to withdraw from the body of Christ. Instead, we need to move toward other passionate—albeit flawed—Christ-followers to walk with us toward healing. We need to be honest with them, with God, and with ourselves about the true state of our hearts. We need them circling around us, crying out, “Abba Father!” on our behalf, reminding us of the Truth: we are no longer slaves, but daughters of the one true God (Galatians 4:6-7).\n\nTogether, we can persevere toward the living hope of the Lord Jesus Christ to whom we’ve been called. \n\nOnly God can love us unconditionally. Hoping in Him will never disappoint us the way the world does time and time again. Because “God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit” we can learn to rejoice and hope again, even in our pain (Romans 5:3,5). But it’s only in clinging to Him that we will find the strength to move forward in faith, one step at a time.\n\nLisa Harper is a master storyteller with a masters of Theological Studies from Covenant Seminary.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 5:12-21, Genesis 3:17-19, 1 Corinthians 15:21-22\n\nSometimes, the weight of living this life just gets to us. It feels sticky and scratchy, less graceful and more gritty. We wander into and out of seasons that leave us asking where God is in the middle of grief or loss or emptiness. \n\nA few weeks ago, I lost my grandfather slowly and suddenly. He was tired one day and hospitalized the next. Not three weeks later, he was gone.\n\nIn those days between admitting him to the hospital and him meeting Jesus, I couldn’t seem to rectify the fact that what was happening felt so foreign and yet so expected. Death is a terrible reality that we live with, an awful and haunting sort of event that wrecks us. But, as we learn early on, it’s inevitable: death is a part of life.\n\nOne night, as I was adjusting his oxygen mask, my fingers combed through his hair, damp with sweat because his breathing was so labored. It reminded me of my nieces waking from a nap, their fine hair damp and sticking to their foreheads. And then I thought of my grandfather as a young boy, running around, playing and sweaty. His mother must have pushed his hair off his forehead, just as I was doing now.\n\nLater, after he was gone, a friend would remark to me, “You know, we labor into this world and we really labor out of it, too.”\n\nOne evening around dusk, I pulled him up to a sitting position, and together we shuffled over to a chair by the window. I sat in front of him, asking question after question about his life. The vesper light caught his eyes as he told me about a career of flying planes all around the world for the Navy. We both knew things were drawing to a close. Still, in that moment, I sensed a very real peace. We both did. It was as if we both understood that our bodies may break down, but Christ has given us life that will carry on for the rest of eternity.\n\nPart of me couldn’t believe his earthly life was coming to an end. But another part of me knew better: this is what happens. Sometimes, we live so deeply rooted in our fallen, fragile reality that we forget there is another, better, truer one.\n\nFor if by the one man’s trespass the many died, how much more have the grace of God and the gift which comes through the grace of the one man Jesus Christ overflowed to the many.\n\n– Romans 5:15\n\nWhen I’m in the throes of hospital visits and errands and trying to make the best of every moment, I can forget the truth. Because of Jesus, life is more than survival or death. It is eternal (Romans 5:20-21).\n\nThese days since my grandfather’s death, I’ve been thinking about how, as a Christian, I live a life marked by beautiful disagreement. Even when it seems death is the only option, the life and light of Christ finds a way to break through. Even when 21 shots are fired and a flag is folded graveside, there is still hope. Even as we watched the setting sun one last time together, we saw the beauty in the darkness.\n\nEven in death, grace reigns.\n\nMelissa Zaldivar is a social in the world of academics and an academic in the world of socials.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebekah Lyons\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 6:1-14, 2 Corinthians 5:18-21, Colossians 3:1-11\n\nMy daughter was baptized a few months ago.\n\nShe decided to follow Jesus in her elementary years, and considered baptism a long while until she entered middle school. The week prior, a pastor from our church sat down in our kitchen to talk to her about the weight of this decision. She was choosing to publicly testify Christ as her Lord to anyone who asked. This was a commitment to follow and serve Jesus no matter what, even when it was difficult.\n\nThe following Sunday she wrote a letter to Jesus, just between them, and pinned it to a wooden cross at the front of our sanctuary before taking her turn in the waters. As her daddy lowered her beneath the water he offered the words, “buried with Jesus in the likeness of His death, and raised to walk in newness of life” (Romans 6:4).\n\nScripture says we joined Jesus in His death when we were baptized. Death no longer rules over Christ Jesus, nor does it rule over those who believe in Him. What’s more, when we died with Christ, we were set free from the power of sin. “For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time.” As believers in Christ Jesus, we are to “consider [ourselves] dead to sin and alive to God” (vv. 9-11).\n\nBut if we’ve truly died to sin, why do we continue to live in it? The act of sharing in Christ’s death wouldn’t be a one-time thing any more than taking communion would be a one-time thing. In fact, we’re told to examine our hearts before we take the bread and the cup (1 Corinthians 11:27). We ought to examine our hearts in everything and invite God to search our hearts too (Psalm 139:23).\n\nWhen we take a lackadaisical approach to our sin, we give it room to rule over us, to distract us. As those who have been crucified with Christ, sin is no longer our ruler. We are not under the law but under grace (Galatians 2:20; Romans 6:14).\n\nThis begs the question: What in my life needs to die each day? What has become an idol, a security, a focus, or a prop that has pushed God aside? I never seem to see sin enter my heart until I hear it roll off my tongue—a little sarcasm here, a critique there. Then envy soon follows, before resentment settles in and camps out. \n\nFor starters, my pride needs to die. It needs to die a thousand deaths. It’s the temptation of the religious leader to get puffed up by our words, thinking the message is ours. But the truth is that God has planted His Word in our hearts (Hebrews 10:16). We are simply called to speak His Word when summoned.\n\nThere’s something else that needs to die for me in this season: production. It’s time for me to get quiet after a long season of pouring out. Making room for the death of an idol opens wide the gates for a new beginning, a new imagination for what God will bring about in the days ahead. I’m walking out these days with an expectant heart, putting my ear to the ground, and listening for a fresh refrain of reverence.\n\nI wonder, is there something that needs to die for you today? When you are joined in Christ’s death through faith, you are also raised with Him in newness of life. Laying down your idols will open the floodgates for freedom to reign once more, making room for new life to spring forth again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 6:15-23, Galatians 5:13-14, 1 Peter 2:11-17\n\nWhen I was in elementary school, I decided I was going to grow an apple tree in our backyard. I didn’t tell my family about it. I wanted to do it secretly so that one day when there was a blossoming apple tree growing out of my mother’s flower bed, everyone would be amazed and I could reveal that I had grown it.\n\nI hoarded an apple seed from an apple I had eaten earlier in the day and smuggled it into the backyard when no one was looking. I dug a shallow hole in the flowerbed, placed the seed inside, and covered it with dirt. Then I hoped for the best.\n\nIn our last Romans passage we learned that Jesus’ death and resurrection does not mean life is a free-for-all, or that we can live however we like because of God’s grace. It means our motivation has changed. We don’t live under the yoke of the law any longer; we live under the covering of Christ, and that gift of grace motivates us to live by God’s Word.  \n\nIn Romans 6:15-23, Paul gives us another reason why Christians should not continue to sin simply because grace is now at play: fruit.\n\nBefore you knew Christ, Paul says, you were slaves of sin (Romans 6:17). And “…when you were slaves of sin, you were free from allegiance to righteousness. So what fruit was produced then from the things you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death. But now, since you have been liberated from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification—and the end is eternal life!” (Romans 6:22).\n\nWhen we interpret the message of grace as permission to continue sinning, we miss out on living a life that bears fruit, and instead, we live lives marked by death, for that is what sin is. This is not only harmful to our own souls; it is harmful to our witness. First Peter 2:12 says, “Conduct yourselves honorably among the Gentiles, so that when they slander you as evildoers, they will observe your good works and will glorify God on the day he visits.”\n\nOur lives do not bear fruit in order for us to look good to others. Our lives bear fruit so that others will see it and know its Source. A fruitless life does not point to our Creator. A fruit-filled one glorifies Him with each step we take (John 15:8).  \n\nYou can probably guess what happened with my apple seed in the backyard. Absolutely nothing. While I had the big idea right—apple seed leads to apple tree—I went about it all wrong. If you really want to grow an apple tree in your backyard, it’s much more complicated than burying a seed and hoping for the best. I looked it up. The real process involves things like “germinating” and “grafting” and transferring the plant from various-sized pots until it is ready for the ground. Then maybe, hopefully, your tree will grow and bear fruit.\n\nI eventually forgot all about my apple tree. Days, weeks, and months went by, and since nothing was growing, I forgot about the seed and my little secret plan. It had been a fruitless effort because I had not properly cared for its growth.\n\nOh, that my Christian life would be the opposite of that poor, non-existent apple tree, that I would live motivated by grace so that others would see a life in full bloom, and that its beauty would point them to its source.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Annie Downs\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 7:1-13, Proverbs 1:19, John 14:6-7\n\nMy buddy Andrea wrote yesterday’s post, and I loved it. But no offense to her, sometimes real, live fruit can show up without much planning. Here’s what I mean.\n\nI follow one of my favorite Instagram accounts specifically for the Insta-stories. One account I adore is of an incredibly fun mom living in Florida. Last week, she did three or four videos of the same tree: an avocado tree. Hanging from the branches were dozens of avocados.\n\n“Look at these beauties!” she yelled to the camera, “And my husband takes all the credit for this tree!”\n\nApparently, a few years before, he’d planted the pit of an avocado there in the backyard, just behind the pool, and voila! AVOCADOS! He didn’t plan it or even care for it. Just planted the pit once the original avocado was eaten and then didn’t think about it again.\n\nJust a dead pit. Buried in the ground.\n\nWhat viewers like me saw was the tree—the product, the fruit grown from the death. But the part we didn’t see were all those days in the middle. The dead days. The days where nothing grew and nothing changed on the outside, but everything was changing on the inside.\n\nI need to see the avocados. And I need to see the dead days too. Because I feel them. Don’t you? There are stories in my life that just plain feel dead. It feels like I did all the work I knew to do, and yet nothing seems to be growing or changing.\n\nBut death brings life. So it is with us because of Jesus.\n\nTherefore, my brothers and sisters, you also were put to death in relation to the law through the body of Christ so that you may belong to another… (Romans 7:4).\n\nTo be a Christian means that we belong to Jesus. And He belongs to us. Our sin was there on the cross. Our flesh was crucified with Him. And when He went to the grave to conquer death, He took our sin—our past, present, and still-to-come-future sin—with Him and buried it all there.\n\nAfter those three dead days had passed, Jesus came back, fully alive, and brought us, His made-new creation, with Him (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nI’m not a huge avocado fan, but I can see an object lesson when it’s before me. So I went to the grocery store, found two avocadoes that felt ripe-ish, and bought them. I didn’t have a plan—I just knew I needed them.\n\nI got home, sliced one open, and no kidding, the minute I saw the pit I started crying. Because I saw it, right there in the middle, the death that had grown life and sustenance. I pulled it out with a knife, washed it off in the sink, and just held it. And prayed.\n\nI asked God about all the avocado pits I see in my life, things that look dead. And I asked if they were ever going to grow into something that mattered. Did they matter? Did He even see them?\n\n…You belong to him who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God (v.4, continued).\n\nWhile the Holy Spirit whispered truth to me, I already knew it; I saw it there in the avocado. Of course, He sees it all. He alone brings life from death, even when it feels like no new fruit will ever will grow in those dry, barren places.\n\nI breathed a prayer of thanks. And then I made guacamole.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 7:14-25, Galatians 5:16-26, 1 John 1:8-10\n\nSure, I was terrible. But it was the fruit flies’ fault.\n\nI’d been at war with them all week, using every trick Google assured me would work. Bowl of vinegar mixed with dish soap? Done. A trap made of fruit and plastic wrap? Yep. Pour diluted bleach down the drain and hope for the best? Affirmative.\n\nI’d done all the entire internet knew to do, to no avail. The fruit flies were multiplying, not disappearing, and I was over it.\n\nI was trying to cook dinner, plotting against the irritating insects in the interim as the pasta boiled and the sauce simmered. I was annoyed—and not just at the state of my kitchen, but at what seemed to be the state of my life. Why couldn’t I just get it all under control already?  \n\nThat’s when David walked in.\n\nI married a good man. He is kind and gracious and funny. And when he walked in the door during my fruit-fly and general-life crisis, I did what any human being would do: I let him have it.\n\nI was as passive-aggressive as I knew how to be and then some. I started slyly with some innocent questions, and then I went in for the kill, attacking his actions and decisions and, in the end, his character. It was awful. I was awful.\n\nHere is what I cannot for the life of me understand: I had no desire to treat my husband with such unkindness and disrespect. I did not stand there in my kitchen, stirring that spaghetti sauce and thinking, When he gets home, I’m going to give him a piece of my mind. Honestly, I don’t know that I’ve ever thought that about him.\n\nI love David. And I love how he loves me. I want nothing but the absolute best for him. But my best intentions were not calling the shots that night. My humanity was.\n\nI’m so grateful for this passage in Romans 7. I’m grateful that God not only knows us fully, but He reassures us of this in His Word. I’m grateful for Paul’s confession that so clearly articulates the struggle I feel in my own heart on a daily basis.\n\nI don’t want to sin. Really, I don’t. But I do it anyway.  \n\nI want to obey the Lord. Really, I do. But I disobey anyway.\n\nPaul’s description of his own sin struggle in Romans 7:14-25 can seem confusing at first read. But read it again, slowly this time. Read it aloud. Do you hear the desperation? Paul, like me (and like you?), does not want to sin. But in and of himself—in his “flesh”—he does not have the ability to be sinless. And he seems pretty frustrated about this. I am, too. Aren’t you?\n\nSin is a disease we are born with but cannot heal. Sin is a slavery we are born into but cannot escape (Romans 3:23; 1 Corinthians 15:22).\n\nSin is a condition we cannot fix. But Jesus can. He has.\n\nThe message of the gospel of Jesus—the gospel that causes Paul to cry, mid-frustration, “Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (v.25)—is that Jesus has rescued us from “this body of death” (v.24). We are more than just our weak-willed bodies; we are souls who have been redeemed by the sinless life and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\n\nYes, we struggle with sin. We struggle to “keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:25), to choose a moment-by-moment life guided by the Spirit of the Lord rather than our selfish desires. But we do not struggle in vain. Our struggle is a fight—a fight to live in the freedom that has already been secured by the Savior who defeated darkness once for all (1 Corinthians 15:55-57).\n\nThanks be to God, for He invites us into a life governed not by our wants or our whims, but by His truth and love.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 8:1-17, Isaiah 53:10, Mark 14:32-36\n\nIndoor plumbing was a luxury in the Haitian village where my adopted daughter, Missy, grew up. And soft, two-ply toilet paper—that was even more rare. When I brought her home to Tennessee, flushing the toilet with copious amounts of Charmin quickly became one of her favorite pastimes.\n\nHow darling!\n\nThat was my thought in those early days as I observed her wide-eyed delight at watching massive plumes of paper spiral downward. But after a while, wading through ankle-deep wastewater in my bathroom and writing large checks to repairmen lost its allure.\n\nSo I was at my wit’s end a couple months ago when I walked into my bathroom—past my innocent-looking daughter splashing in a bubble bath—slipped on the wet tile, and quickly discovered water gushing out of the commode like Niagara Falls. After a heavy sigh, I morphed into the put-upon persona my mother used when I did something especially naughty as a child:\n\nDoggone it, Missy, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU not to use giant gobs of toilet paper like this?!\n\nI angrily set about cleaning up the mess. The entire time I was plunging and fussing and mopping up that yucky pond with beach towels, I had my back turned to Missy.\n\nAs the water and my irritability subsided, I turned around to see my precious little girl staring at me mournfully, big tears streaming down her beautiful brown cheeks. I’d all but crushed her spirit over something innocent and insignificant. She wasn’t trying to cause a mess. She hadn’t been willfully disobedient or disrespectful. This was a plumbing issue—not a heart issue.\n\nI lifted her out of the tub, dried her off with our last dry towel, and rocked her back and forth until she stopped crying. I carefully explained that it was wrong for Mama to raise her voice, that I’d made a very bad choice, and that I was so sorry I’d hurt her feelings.\n\nThat night I called my contractor, who seemed perplexed when I asked, “Hey, Jack, you know those really powerful toilets on cruise ships that sound like they could suck your leg off when you flush them? Can you install one of those in my bathroom?”\n\nLess than forty-eight hours later, our brand-new supersonic vacuum version of a toilet was installed. I cheered so enthusiastically after Missy’s inaugural flush, you’d have thought she’d won an Olympic medal.\n\nOur recent toiletastrophes have reminded me just how much I love, value, and cherish my little girl. They’ve also reminded me of how God the Father loves, values, and cherishes me, His kid.\n\nI’m overwhelmed by the beautiful, redemptive ways He’s moved in my life. How He chose a former Haitian orphan, who lost her first mom to AIDS and never knew her biological father, to effectively rip out the last stubborn roots of the orphaned, fatherless spirit that have been growing in my own heart since long before I was Missy’s age.\n\nFor those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory\n\n(Romans 8:14-17, NIV).\n\nChildren. Heirs. Coheirs with Christ.\n\nGod continues to employ my unlikely, only-by-grace, position of motherhood as a constant, colorful illustration of how He cheers Himself hoarse over every ungainly cartwheel we do (Zephaniah 3:17). How He leans down and hangs on every word of our mostly narcissistic prayers. How—despite our proclivity to make huge messes—He is so completely for us.\n\nLisa Harper is a master storyteller with a masters of Theological Studies from Covenant Seminary. She’s lauded as an engaging, hilarious communicator as well as an authentic and substantive Bible teacher. She’s been in vocational ministry for 30 years and has written 15 books (her latest being, The Sacrament of Happy: What a Smiling God Brings to a Wounded World) and Bible study curriculums but says her greatest accomplishment by far is that of becoming Missy’s (her adopted daughter from Haiti) mama!

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebekah Lyons\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 8:18-25, Isaiah 65:17, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Revelation 21:1-6\n\nIt begins as far back as we can remember. Right before we run off to school, we smear on our mama’s lip gloss and clamp down as many hair clips as our endless bangs will allow. We hope for another attempt to fit in with the others, to measure up, to belong.\n\nGrowing up, I often found myself hanging in the balance between enjoying the moment and anticipating the next one. As a young child, my hopes centered around a 25-cent soft serve ice cream cone after church on Sunday nights. My hopes matured as I did—working to make the swim team, racing to the finish line at a track meet, striving to win an award. I hoped for slumber party invitations, a certain new sweater for Christmas and, of course, beating my brother at checkers.\n\nThose early years of putting my best foot forward, I hoped the appearance of having it all together would win me friends. But years down the line, the stakes of life loomed larger, and deep heartache entered in—nevermind the lip gloss or hair clips.\n\nIn truly tragic moments, our hope is put to the test. And if it’s misplaced, it will be found wanting. \n\nThe hope we read about in Romans offers us a greater understanding of the hope God offers. It takes us from tangible evidence we can see, and pushes us deeper into a faith that asks for what we cannot see. In fact, all of creation is wired for this. If something breaks, we are hardwired to figure out a solution. Most problems can’t be solved in a day, so we work and test and try until we receive the desired outcome. But there will always be a hope offered by God that requires all of Him, and no amount of our working and testing will bring it to pass. This is the hope of Christ, our Rescuer and Redeemer.\n\nBecause of Christ, we are free to hope in even the most difficult or uncertain circumstances. In the first chapter of his epistle, James tells us to “consider it a great joy” whenever we face trials because the testing of our faith produces spiritual endurance (vv. 2-3). Trials are accompanied by hope. Hope is a gift. Hope is critical, and the gospel gives it to us in unending supply.\n\nNow in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience (Romans 8:24-25).\n\nAny suffering we endure here and now is incomparable to God’s coming glory (Romans 8:18). The measure of trials we have endured directly relates to the measure of hope we offer the world. This is the beautiful gift of hope.\n\nOne day our groans will give way to glory. While we wait, we place our hope in Jesus.\n\nHe will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away (Revelation 21:4).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 8:26-39, Psalm 44:17-22, Philippians 1:6, 2 Thessalonians 2:14\n\nI hope your summer fun list includes a trip to an amusement park or two. Nothing gets the blood pumping quite like circling a track at 100 miles per hour while simultaneously crying, laughing, and screaming. That’s good stuff.\n\nBut before you fill the water bottles and load the kids into the minivan for a day of sweltering, screaming fun, I need to let you in on a secret your brain already knows.\n\nIt starts with a feeling sociologists call “museum feet.” It’s a phenomenon our brains experience when we’re in a big space like an amusement park or a museum. It’s a general sense of being lost or exhausted that comes from hanging out in such a large space.\n\n“Museum feet” could give park-goers a bad experience, causing them to leave the park and not return. But architects have learned that if they include a large visual landmark, we’re less likely to become overwhelmed. They’re looking out for us, and their bottom line, by ensuring we’re willing to stay on the grounds long enough to fork over the cash for overpriced lemonade and nachos.\n\nThink about it: Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World. Spaceship Earth at Epcot Center. The 150-foot “Big Wheel” Ferris wheel at Six Flags. Each offers their own brand of fun, sure, but they also give a reference point to come back to, something to focus on when we feel overwhelmed, overtired, or just over it.\n\nPaul never made it to Disney World, but he must’ve known a thing or two about feeling anxious, overwhelmed, or disoriented. Here, in Romans chapter 8, he shoots up a flare of truth for the believer to come back to every time we feel the same.\n\nAnd we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28).\n\nIf this is one of those feel-good verses that’s become so familiar you’re tempted to race past it—STOP. This is the mother lode, friends! If God can use all things for our good and His glory, nothing can knock us off kilter. He makes us sure-footed. It’s the kind of steady posture that caused Paul to restate the truth of Romans 8:28 for the church in Philippi.\n\nI am sure of this, that he who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus (Philippians 1:6).\n\nPaul is describing the process of redemption—that supernatural metamorphosis whereby God makes all things new. Paul was so anchored in the gospel that no wind could capsize him. That’s not new news, but this may be: the steadiness of Paul is possible for us too.\n\nGod’s promise in Romans 8:28 means He’s already at work, reshaping everything for our good. Tribulation, persecution, famine—God can redeem all of these and more (v.35). Nothing can stop the redemption process (vv.38-39). Not death, not life, not angels or rulers. Not this moment or all the tomorrows to come. Nothing can stop God from working all things for good—not even you.\n\nLife is big. It’s easy to feel lost or overwhelmed or like we want off the ride, but God’s truth anchors us against museum feet. The story of redemption gives us a point to come back to when we feel alone or afraid. The next time you feel overwhelmed, overtired, or just plain over it, look up. The same cross that steadied Paul in the face of unthinkable trials will steady you.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 9:1-19, Exodus 32:30-32, Ephesians 1:3-6\n\nYou’ve probably been there—that terrible moment when you feel like you’re watching a train about to wreck. Your roommate chooses to stay in a toxic relationship. Your child makes a series of self-destructive decisions. Your brother or sister persists in a state of total denial. Your friend walks away from God.\n\nHelplessness is a special kind of agony, especially when it comes to our loved ones. This is the agony Paul expresses in Romans 9 about the choices of Israel. Having had his eyes opened to the light of the gospel, Paul realizes with great anguish that many of his people—God’s people—have not awakened to the good news of Jesus Christ. Theologian N. T. Wright describes Paul’s reaction this way: “[Paul] was like someone driving in convoy who takes a particular turn in the road and then watches in horror as most of the other cars take the other fork.”\n\nPaul’s sorrow is so great that he would rather take their place: “I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the benefit of my brothers and sisters” (v.3). This chapter, then, is not a cold, calculating explanation of Israel’s history and fate. Instead, Paul is wrestling with the mysterious ways of God, and he doesn’t arrive at many neat and tidy conclusions.\n\nIn Romans 9, Paul engages some complex theological questions, but if we zoom in a bit and look at his heart, we might recognize our own. Most of us have walked in Paul’s shoes—grieving the rebellion, blindness, or self-destruction of someone we love. From Paul’s own wrestling with heartache, we can discern two spiritual principles:\n\n1. None of us can boast. None of us stands on moral high ground. God’s grace was not extended to us on the basis of human merit, but divine mercy. That is the principle Paul points to throughout the history of Israel: Isaac, not Ishmael; Jacob, not Esau. These men, these chosen ones who constituted the line of Abraham, were not selected because of their outstanding moral character, but because of the free compassion of God. As Paul explains, “It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy” (v.16). In other words, none of us can pat ourselves on the back for our good choices or our strong faith, while silently judging others. It is all a gift, so that none of us should boast.\n\n2. God is sovereign. The relationship between God’s power and our free will is a mysterious one, indeed. But when it comes to the decisions of a loved one, God’s sovereignty removes a great deal of weight from our shoulders. Namely, we cannot force someone to make the right choice. We cannot yell someone into wisdom. We cannot wrestle someone into agreeing with us. And we cannot compel transformation. There is only One who directs the streams of human hearts, and that is God alone.\n\nThe sovereignty of God does not permit us to become callous, nor does it permit complacency. Like Paul, we should mourn destruction whenever we encounter it. But it can relieve us of a burden we were never meant to bear.\n\nOnly God knows the whole picture and the entire story. Our task is to share the good news to the best of our ability, in humility, and then prayerfully leave the rest to Him.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 9:20-33, Jeremiah 18:1-6, Ephesians 1:11-14\n\nI did an internship in Washington D.C. the summer before my junior year in college. The job was good enough; I coordinated summer camp logistics for kids interested in politics. Yes, it was as nerdy as you’re imagining, and yes, I was a former attendee. But the best thing about that summer wasn’t licking envelopes and herding hormones. It was meeting a new group of friends at church.\n\nI don’t know if you’re familiar with the town of Stars Hollow from the TV show Gilmore Girls, but those quirky, fictional characters had nothing on my new, real-life friends. Despite the fact that I was a stranger in town, and only planning to stay for eight weeks, they grafted me in, constantly hounding me to join them for weekend adventures of camping, floating down rivers, or taking long motorcycle rides through the Shenandoah Valley. It was as dreamy as it sounds, and healing for my soul in many, many ways.\n\nWe talked about the gospel, too, and one of those conversations led to the topic of the providence of God—what some call “predestination.” The candor of the conversation shocked me. Who talks about this stuff anyway? And what does the providence of God even mean?\n\nI was kindly pointed to today’s passage in Romans, and from there one friend explained the idea that God knows, plans, and orchestrates everything. All the days ordained for me (and you, for that matter) were written in His book before one of them came to be (Psalm 139:16). We are God’s workmanship created to do good works that He prepared in advance for us to do (Ephesians 2:10). Salvation itself is a righteousness that comes by faith, and even that comes from Him.\n\nAt face value, the concept that God is in control of everything might seem offensive. We humans have a cosmic authority problem. We don’t like to believe that Someone else has the final say in our lives. When Paul asks in Romans 9:20, “Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’”, I want to scream, “Yes! That’s what my prayers to God sound like on a regular basis!” But if we are to take Romans 9 to heart, we have to concede that God is ultimately the one in control of His creation.\n\nIn the years since my dream summer in D.C., I’ve learned a lot about faith. I’ve read much more of the Bible. I’ve spent countless hours with Jesus. And despite all that, God’s providence is as mysterious to me now as it was then. But I do know this: I would rather believe in a loving God who is fulfilling His purpose for me, than a cosmic universe that is inflicting its chaos on me.\n\nI look at the seasons, coming and going in their time. I look at the ocean waves, which know their boundaries. I look at my face in the mirror—imperfect, yes, but a masterpiece in the Master’s hands. I look at the miracles of birth and life and death. None of it is a mistake. This beauty is His creation, and He is sovereign.\n\nIf we trust Him—if we believe His love—we can put away our questions of Why did you make me like this? and put on the posture of Thy will be done.\n\n Claire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

I was a senior in college, involved in campus ministry and leading a Bible study, and I enthusiastically updated her on both endeavors. I’d begun telling yet another story when she calmly interrupted me with a simple, matter-of-fact statement: “You believe in a works-based gospel.” \n\nWe’d known each other a while, and her statement stunned me. Was she serious? \n\nI quickly brushed it off in the moment. But later that week, I found myself kneeling by the side of my bed, soaking my plaid, purple bedspread with tears. She was right. \n\nThere I was, wallowing in my sin, wanting desperately to be back in the loving arms of my Savior. I had asked for forgiveness, but the relief wasn’t coming. As I poured my guilty conscience onto the pages of my journal, I was struck by one word: time.\n\nThat’s what I thought I needed: time. I didn’t really want forgiveness. I wanted time—enough time to fill my life up with the right things, the good things, to settle the score. It was salvation by works at its worst. \n\nAll my striving, all my desire to put time between myself and my mistakes, it was another attempt to earn my salvation through my own effort. Rather than trusting the work of Christ on the cross for my righteousness, I had become dependent on my own actions to save me.\n\nI was living exactly like the Israelites Paul describes in Romans 10:\n\nSince they are ignorant of the righteousness of God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to God’s righteousness (v. 3).\n\nAfter Christ’s death and resurrection, Israel was still working hard to keep the Law of Moses in order to gain righteousness. They were working to save themselves, forgetting that “Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes” (v. 4). \n\nThe law, our works, the right things—they were never supposed to save us. God had planned our salvation and redemption through Jesus Christ all along. Christ is the only perfect fulfillment, the only victory we have over sin and death. His perfect life allows us to be justified through our faith alone. Faith and nothing else, just Jesus—this is the message of Christ.\n\n“For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (v. 13). \n\nAs I knelt beside my bed that day, I realized Jesus truly was all I needed. His sacrifice covered me then, despite all my striving, and it covers me today. I need His righteousness, not my own. He is enough. \n\nFriends, no matter what our past, present, or future holds, the only work that can save us is the work Christ completed on the cross. May we call on His name.\n\nOne believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation (v. 10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 11:1-24, Hosea 14:4-7, Ephesians 2:8-9\n\nThe first time I read Romans 11, I saw God as very kind. \n\nBut today, that kindness seems far away—30,000 miles below me, to be exact. This time, I’m reading Romans from seat 12B, squished between two strangers. And the pilot has just warned us that “significant turbulence” is ahead. \n\nA hush fell over the cabin in that awkward “I’m playing it cool” kind of way. Because it’s totally going to be fine. I mean, how likely is that whole “unlikely” in-case-of-an-emergency situation, anyway?\n\nWe’re all eyeing the flight attendants to gauge their uneasiness.\n\nJust when you’ve settled into your seat and become comfortable with God’s kindness, the winds shift. His tender mercies can also feel severe. Regardless of how much we show it, we’re all afraid of crashing.\n\nThe Romans were afraid of this too. After all, Israel had taken a hard fall following God’s rejection, so it only seemed natural for this band of new believers to begin bracing themselves for a similar emergency landing. They were afraid that if God didn’t turn out to be who He said He was, they’d have to take matters into their own hands. \n\nIt’s in moments like these that sweet songs about God’s kindness and goodness do not trump the truth about His severity. Just like we need the fullness of God’s character, we need to know the fullness of His Truth.\n\nAlthough the pilot reassures us that everything is under control, I’m tempted to entertain anxious questions. Did they check the plane to make sure it was safe before we boarded? Is the pilot keeping something from us? Is everything really just fine?\n\nWhen bad things happen that we don’t understand, are we just naïve to keep hoping? Will God reject us like He rejected Israel? It’s when we face the unknown that we find out how well we trust God’s character… which brings me to Jello.\n\nCreated by pilot and therapist Captain Tom Bunn to illustrate turbulence, the Jello Exercise compares a plane’s high-traveling, air-thickening speeds to being encased in Jello. While turbulent bumps may make you feel like you’re falling from the sky, it’s actually more like tapping the top of a Jello mold: the plane can bounce up and down, but it cannot fall. In fact, it barely moves at all. Regardless of the bumps, the plane is sustained, completely, by a force we can’t even see. \n\nSo are God’s people.\n\n“Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, though a wild olive branch, were grafted in among them and have come to share in the rich root of the cultivated olive tree, do not boast that you are better than those branches. But if you do boast—you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you” (Romans 11:17-18).\n\nIt is by grace that we cannot fully comprehend what it takes to sustain us. Not only does God know exactly what it takes, but in His kindness He sent Jesus to endure the severity for us. When love isn’t taken lightly, grace must also be severe.\n\nIt takes an intense, thickening wind to keep a plane steady in the clouds. It takes a kind, severe God to sustain us for His glory. Today, He is not only kind, but also severe, and exactly Who we need.\n\n“The people will return and live beneath his shade. They will grow grain and blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon” (Hosea 14:7).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 11:25-36, Isaiah 40:13-15, 1 Corinthians 12:4-11\n\nPerhaps you’ve heard the not-so-fairy-tale-like stories of the children of Israel. Like the one where God rescued them from slavery, and they responded by grumbling about the flavors missing from their menu (Numbers 11). Or the one where they got impatient with Moses as he met with God on Mt. Sinai, so they decided to worship a golden calf (Exodus 32). Or the time when they came to the border of the promised land and listened to their knees knocking and hearts racing, instead of listening to the voice of God (Numbers 13).\n\nWhen we flip forward in our Bibles to the New Testament, we find God’s people still stuck in the ruts of rejection and rebellion. It was, after all, the Jewish leaders who led the charge to have Jesus arrested, tried, convicted, and crucified (Matthew 26:3-5). After the resurrection, they remained resolute in their opposition of Jesus, doing everything in their power to squelch the message of the Church. \n\nYet here in Romans 11, Paul reminds us that despite their chronic grumbling and wilderness wandering, despite their golden calf worshipping and Savior scourging, the Jewish people remain God’s “beloved” (v. 28). \n\nOur human logic may balk at this, but Paul warns against trusting only what makes sense to our brains (Romans 11:25). Try as we might, we cannot understand God’s love using our flawed standards for love and acceptance. Chapter after chapter, verse after verse, the story of God’s commitment to His chosen people doesn’t make sense. Human understanding leaves us wondering, Why did God choose them? But through the lens of the gospel, the story of the Jews suddenly makes sense. Look at Deuteronomy 7:6-8.\n\n“For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth” (v. 6).  \n\nLean in. Listen closely to this next part. \n\n“It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all the peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath he swore to your fathers. . .” (vv. 7-8).\n\nGod knew His beloved were weak and frail—incapable of keeping their side of the covenant. Still He chose them, loves them, and keeps His promises to them. \n\nThe Bible is not the story of a wayward people but of a faithful God. \n\nIn the shadow of the cross, we are God’s chosen people. Because of the gospel, our identity has been changed from “not my people” to “my people” (Romans 9:25). Christ’s sacrifice made a way for us to be among the “beloved.” The gifts God has lavished upon us are so extravagant, and we are so undeserving, that we sometimes worry He’ll take them back. But “God’s gracious gifts and calling are irrevocable” (Romans 11:29). \n\nThe depth of God’s wisdom is matched only by the depth of His love. He has promised unfathomable gifts to us and He will never snatch them back. If every one of God’s acts of love and faithfulness toward the Jewish people could be contained, they’d overflow the seas. We, too, can stand on the shore and see the unmistakable faithfulness of God. \n\nWe are weak.\n\nWe are wayward. \n\nAnd yet, the Prince and the kingdom are irrevocably ours.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

To put it another way, I stink at it.\n\nI’m the one in my family who excitedly asks, “Who wants to go get ice cream?” rather than stick to our sensible meal plan. I’m notorious for drafting a shiny new routine that lasts for three days before I’m ready for spontaneity again. Despite my best efforts to implement structure in my life, I’m all over the place. I’ve come to accept that flexibility is just part of who God made me to be.\n\nBut here’s the truth. For me, that acceptance spills over into a lack of spiritual discipline. The world tells us that fulfilling our every desire or whim in the moment is a sign of happiness, success, and freedom. But I can say from experience that ignoring spiritual disciplines only leads to chains, not freedom.\n\nPaul warns us, “Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,” and I find myself staring longingly at his words (Romans 12:2). I want that. I want my body—my whole self—to be “a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God” (v. 1).\n\nI tried renewing my mind by attending church, but I didn’t make time to engage with God at home. I’d sit half-dazed in front of my computer, reading about fall fashion trends rather than reading my Bible. I’d watch one more episode of my favorite show and skip my prayer time. I wanted to read my Bible and pray and live out Romans 12:2, but my propensity for distraction and gluttony grew. I couldn’t control them on my own, no matter how guilty I felt or how many times I vowed to change.\n\nI’d forgotten that only God can transform my heart. And that transformation takes place in the context of the body of Christ, His Church—not just out here on my own, accompanied only by my best intentions.    \n\nMaybe your struggle is the opposite of mine, and routine and productivity are the desires that take the place of true renewal. Or perhaps your days are bound by a structure that you don’t want God to bend, a rigidity where spending time with Him in Scripture and in prayer are items on a checklist rather than intimate interaction with your heavenly Father. Whatever your personality, spiritual disciplines are tools that lift our eyes from our circumstances and desires and focus our hearts on God’s presence. Prayer, fasting, Bible study—they’re all disciplines that renew our minds and refresh our spirits. But unlike a resolution, a diet, or an exercise regimen, they aren’t sustained by our willpower.\n\nTrue spiritual growth is rooted in the Spirit’s work in us, not in our effort. God is the Giver. We are the recipient. He empowers. We surrender. We do this individually, as God’s daughters and sons, and we do this corporately, as His children and Church.\n\nMay we truly worship the Lord today by offering Him our whole selves, surrendering our desires to His will and our efforts to His strength, “according to the grace given to us” (Romans 12:6). Amen.\n\nJill McDaniel is a northern girl who married a southern gentleman and settled in the Midwest.

Rid your life of hypocrisy. Love deeply. Outdo one another in showing honor. Do not lack diligence in zeal. Share with the saints. Pursue hospitality. Live at peace with everyone…\n\nWith everyone? Really?\n\nDude. Paul. I need some coffee. And also, when am I supposed to binge-watch my TV shows?\n\nIn all honesty, when I compare my life to the lives of the disciples, I begin to see why Paul fills 1 Corinthians 4:6-13 with so much irony. I practically live like a queen compared to Christ’s beloved friends back in the day, and compared to much of the world today. Most of my time is spent concerned about how I’ll choose to spend my time.\n\nI catch myself daydreaming about the life the world tells me I should have: a life with a passionate (never rocky) marriage to my soulmate, a clean and immaculate house, a career that’s advancing, children that are thriving, and plenty of time at the gym maintaining the body of a teenager. To top it off, the world tells me I need to portray this “perfect” life to the world on social media, to attract more followers.\n\nWith this world as my guide, adding Paul’s list to the mix is absolutely impossible. There are not enough hours in the day to do both what the world demands of me and what God desires for me. And so I have to choose.\n\nEvery single day I have to choose whom I will serve: my flesh or my God. Some days I make the right choice. Some days I make the wrong one. This is the life of a work in progress, one that God promises to bring to completion in His time (Philippians 1:6).\n\nPerhaps that’s why Paul tells us to “cling to what is good” (Romans 12:9). If good was an easy, simple thing to hold onto, why would he tell us to cling to it? I know that in my own life, if I’m not clinging to God, the natural inclination of my heart is one of jealousy, coveting, and destructive daydreams. So while it seems like what Paul is cautioning us to do should be obvious, I know it to be oh-so difficult to put into practice. Detest what is evil; cling to what is good. I know that If I’m clinging to something, then I’m desperate, grasping. I’m holding on for dear life.\n\nThese passages remind me that my very life is at stake, and that evil really is evil. Paul pokes at my carefully built life, reminding me that Christ’s path of goodness and stillness and quietness is the only route to peace. I can rest knowing that the battle is the Lord’s. But I can’t assume that rest and peace will come without effort on my part, without my choosing God. I must cling to Him and let go of everything else.\n\nDear Lord, help me to hold on.\n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 13:1-14, Daniel 2:19-23, Hebrews 11:32-40\n\nThe Bible is filled with the stories of people who have defied authority. Moses stood up to Pharaoh then led the Israelites out of Egypt. Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego all refused to worship any other god but Yahweh—and were then thrown into the lions’ den and fiery furnace, respectively. (Spoiler alert: God saved them all, and for His glory.)\n\nStephen defied the ruling Jewish Council, preached the gospel of Jesus, and was stoned to death for it. Paul and other apostles were martyred by the Roman government during the persecution of Christians.\n\nAnd yet this same Paul, who likely later died at the hands of his government, urges believers to honor and respect those in authority. Paul—who knew many examples throughout Jewish history of standing up to corrupt rulers—says to obey, seemingly without question. What are we to make of this?\n\nOf course, it’s natural to wonder, What if the government was urging murder, stealing, or some other form of not loving one’s neighbor? What if the ruling authorities were, as Nebuchadnezzar did, asking their people to bow down to another god? Or no god at all?\n\nScripture has given us plenty of evidence that Christ is the ultimate authority in heaven and on earth. Paul isn’t contradicting that here. What he is doing in Romans 13, is laying down a foundation for Christian living—reminding us that our ultimate authority is Jesus. Our first and truest loyalty is to Him.\n\nPeter gives a similar exhortation in 1 Peter 2. After telling the people, “you are a chosen race, a holy priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession” (v. 9), he says:\n\nSubmit to every human authority because of the Lord, whether to the emperor as the supreme authority or to governors as those sent out by him to punish those who do what is evil and to praise those who do what is good… Honor everyone. Love the brothers and sisters. Fear God. Honor the emperor (vv. 13-14,17).\n\nPeter starts by reminding believers of who they are: the body of Christ, a holy nation of God that extends beyond borders. This is a beautiful truth for us to cling to as well, especially in times of deep confusion, national partisanship, and turmoil within our own institutions.\n\nBoth Peter and Paul tell early Christians to honor their government, but they do so in the context of the whole story of Scripture (and their own writings), affirming that Jesus is Lord over all. Therefore, we obey the government when it doesn’t contradict God’s commands—and we do it joyfully, as a way of honoring God.\n\nJohn Piper says it this way: “And it is very important to stress that, just as we may have to disobey the civil authorities for Christ’s sake, so all our obedience should be for His sake as well. We never have two masters … Every time we say yes to any law, it should be a yes to Jesus.”\n\nOur every action should be motivated by our identity as followers of Christ and citizens of God’s kingdom:\n\nThe night is nearly over, and the day is near; so let us discard the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. Let us walk with decency, as in the daytime: not in carousing and drunkenness; not in sexual impurity and promiscuity; not in quarreling and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and don’t make plans to gratify the desires of the flesh (Romans 13:12-14).\n\nThe Bible offers many examples of what godly citizenship looks like in an earthly kingdom. Let us pray continually that we will seek first God’s Kingdom, listening to the promptings of the Holy Spirit as we engage thoughtfully with our own earthly governments. \n\nMelanie Rainer is the director of content for JellyTelly, where she writes and edits family spiritual formation resources.

Tonight my friends and I are headed to watch the Nashville Sounds play minor league baseball. There, I will hug everyone too many times, introduce friends who don’t already know one another, drink multiple Coke ICEEs, and maybe catch a foul ball. Then I will fall into bed tonight sure that I’m the luckiest woman alive.\n\nMy life is far from perfect. But the life I’ve spent 37 years putting together is turning out alright. Not perfect, not problem-free, but pretty awesome nonetheless.\n\nThe older I get, the more I draw boundaries in my life, making it the life I want to live. Some of my life rules wouldn’t work for you, and I’m okay with that. For starters, I’m dairy-free (it’s an allergy thing), but I wouldn’t ask you—or any of my friends at my birthday party—to live without milk, let alone eat cake WITHOUT ice cream. That beautiful stuff should never go to waste!\n\nThen there’s the matter of rest. My day off each week is almost always a Wednesday. That doesn’t mean it needs to be your weekly day to rest. It simply means Wednesdays work best for me.\n\nAnd then there’s the soccer. I watch it every chance I get. But you don’t have to do the same. Though, I’d highly recommend it because it’s just the best. Period.\n\n The beauty of maturing, and also growing up in my faith, is that I no longer want to look like you. In high school I wanted to look like you, sound like you, and like what you like. Not now. Now, I want to live MY life. I want to look like me—the best, healthiest, kindest, truest version of me. There’s this thing we get to do whenever we’re tired of comparing our lives to other people’s lives: we get to live our own.\n\n You know what it is? It’s the difference between bondage and freedom. Freedom is not a life without boundaries or borders or rule. It’s a life full of the good kind of boundaries, the kind that keep you healthy and strong, living the life God made you to live. It’s the life that is uniquely yours.\n\nFor none of us lives for himself, and no one dies for himself. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord (Romans 14:7-8).\n\nWe often think freedom as just wide open space. But I’ve never found that to be true. Real freedom is found in knowing Jesus. It is giving yourself permission to live wide open in the spaces where God has placed you and in the ways He has made you. My fences around my spaces are going to look different from yours, but there is such safety and health and permission inside the boundaries built just for you.\n\nScripture tells us that if we’re Christ-followers, then the life we get to live belongs to Him  anyway. Galatians 2:20 says, “The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.”\n\nThat right there—living for Jesus—is living your best life.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 14:13-23, 1 Corinthians 8:8-13, Ephesians 4:25-32, Ephesians 5:1-2\n\nI’ve always heard this passage in Romans 14 interpreted according to clothing, music, alcohol, smoking, and more—all in terms of “not being a stumbling block for others.” I was tender to my power to be a stumbling block of every sort, both to the believing and the unbelieving, checking over my shoulder to see the carnage I’d left in my wake. Truth was, I left hardly any, but it didn’t stop me from metaphorically cutting off arms and legs, gouging out eyes and the like, in pursuit of protecting my brothers and sisters.\n\nThe Christian life, I thought, was more about what I couldn’t do than what I could.\n\nHow glorious, then, when the true gospel began to take root in my heart. I began to understand that freedom in Christ meant I was truly free to live. As it turns out, Christ had declared me more than clean. He’d declared me redeemed.\n\nFor all the ways I’d formerly applied this passage, though, the one I’d not considered was food. I knew all food had been declared clean, that we’re no longer under the law of Moses in our dietary restrictions. But what I didn’t understand was the law of our current world with regard to food: the diet and exercise industry. Everywhere I look, the acceptable Christian message of caring for the temple of the Holy Spirit turns into what I imagine Paul might’ve called the “god of the belly” (Philippians 3:19).\n\nIn Philippians 3, Paul warns of the dangers of gluttony. But today, in modern culture, the opposing god—though a no less despicable one—is the one who demands less food, more restrictions, better supplements, flatter stomachs, tighter abs, and the list goes on. In an attempt to care for the temples of the Holy Spirit with eating and exercising, we can destroy our bodies (which are wasting away, whether we like it or not) and cause harm to the impressionable hearts and minds of others who jump on every new regime or diet we offer.\n\nWe want to be well, to eat healthy, whole, good food. We love the rhythms of feasting and fasting we see in Scripture. We want to move our bodies, staying limber and active. But we don’t want to destroy our hearts by lusting after what we don’t have: slimmer physiques and sculpted thighs. We don’t want to destroy our bodies by rebounding from one quick-fix supplement to another. We don’t want to destroy our minds by believing our approval comes from certain lifestyles or appearances.\n\nThere are countless difficulties in life, opportunities to be divided over race, gender, theology, and history. And food, instead of becoming a means to crush those divides—to draw near to one another, armed with soups, fruits, breads, vegetables, and meats—has become one more line of division.\n\nChrist died for all; this is what the Bible says. I don’t want to be known by what I eat or don’t eat. I want to be known by how I love and Who I’m loved by.\n\nSo then, let us pursue what promotes peace and what builds up one another. Do not tear down God’s work because of food (Romans 14:19-20).\n\nWhatever struggle you’re caught in the throes of today, know that you are loved by Christ. He spread His own body, bleeding and broken, to fit a cross you could never bear on your own. Don’t destroy your own body by what you do or don’t eat. Christ died for all—every curve, every bulge, and every stretch-mark—all of it.\n\nFor “the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit” (Romans 14:17). God gives us food as a means of provision, not division. Instead of fostering false divisions today, let’s bake a cake, make a soup or a sandwich, and share it with someone in the pursuit of peace.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

These memories are filled with flipping off the diving board, shouting “Marco Polo,” and of course, playing King of the Mountain. The goal of King of the Mountain was to be the only one on top of the raft, ruling your kingdom by any means necessary. Growing up with brothers, I had to be scrappy and strategic to win at this brutal game. From a young age, I learned that only the strong survive.\n\nI’m told that as a grown-up, it’s not cool to push people off rafts at the pool. The thing is though, we still want to be on top. We just have different rafts now, and we’ve learned to defend our turf in more covert, “polite” ways. \n\nSo much of how we respond has to do with the season we’re in. When we’re treading water, we hope and pray for a gracious hand to help us onto the raft. But when we’re on top, it’s easy to become prideful in our position. It gets especially ugly when we believe there isn’t enough room on the raft for everyone. Even in the Church, we can foster the belief that the kingdom of God only has space for the “good” people, whether we’re conscious of it or not. \n\nIn our reading for today, Paul was writing to a Roman church comprised of two very different people groups: the Jews and the Gentiles. Even from its earliest days, it seems there were divisions amongst the believers in that region. Those who were “strong” didn’t want to help those they considered weak. But Paul challenged the Romans to accept one another, just as Christ had accepted them (Romans 15:7).\n\nPaul points out that even the strongest among us, Jesus Christ, did not use His power to please Himself. If anybody had a right to boast it was the Lord, yet He took our weakness upon Himself to the point of sacrificing His very life. \n\nWe are all in need of God’s grace. In that humility we can seek to be like Jesus, freely passing on the strength and encouragement that has been gifted to us. If the Lord of the universe humbled Himself and bore our weaknesses, how much more eager should we be to do the same for those whom He’s placed around us?\n\nIn addition to following the sacrificial example of Jesus, Paul also calls the Roman church to accept one another for the glory of God. When we’re competitive and exclusive in our churches, how do you suppose we’re seen from the outside? Our witness is compromised by our selfishness. But if we’re a countercultural people and can demonstrate with love and sincerity that there is room at the table of God, then we will have something divinely different to offer.\n\nIt’s tempting to believe the lie of this world, that we must fight to be on top. But in the kingdom of God there is always enough for everyone. As believers, we’re called to lay down our lives for others just as Christ did, to love both the strong and the weak. If we stop trying to protect our little rafts, together we will glorify and join in celebration with the one true King, who lives and reigns over all the mountains. \n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

I think constantly about what works and what doesn’t. In short, plans are my jam.\n\nIn my final year of seminary, a job opportunity arose. It was one of those really great, safe jobs that worked in all the practical ways. I would have a plan—in case, you know, God didn’t come through. I walked through the interview process until the final meeting, when we were to discuss terms for my employment. That morning I confessed to God that I was more concerned about my five-year plan than His plans for me. Then I did what I knew I had to do: I walked into that last interview and said, “This is just not where I need to be.” \n\nAt first, I felt amazing, like that scene in The Devil Wears Prada where Anne Hathaway throws her cell phone into the fountain. Life felt extraordinary, like I was jumping off of the proverbial cliff of my ordinary, planned-out life into the unknown. Later, as I sat alone, it hit me: I had no backup plan and only a few months until graduation. Panic set in, and I did what most of us do in crisis. I told absolutely no one that I was struggling.\n\nOne Sunday, my friend Laura cornered me at church. She barely had to acknowledge the look on my face before I spilled my doubts and fears of being a failure and a fool. I felt shame. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t even know how I was going to buy groceries that week.\n\nLaura didn’t miss a beat. She saw past the facade and grabbed my arm, looked me in the eye and said, “I don’t have an answer for you. But I can tell you that God is with you. Even when you can’t believe that, I’ll believe it for you.” Laura reminded me of the blessing that is mine as a follower of Jesus—a peace greater than my plans. \n\nPaul’s life was filled with adventure and excitement (think: shipwrecks and jail time) but he, too, was created for community. In Romans 15:23-24, he writes, “I have strongly desired for many years to come to you whenever I travel to Spain. For I hope to see you when I pass through and to be assisted by you for my journey there, once I have first enjoyed your company for a while.” In these moments we catch glimpses of Paul’s ordinary life, even in the midst of extraordinary journeys. \n\nI imagine he felt lonely at times. I wonder if part of him didn’t want to admit his own struggles. \n\nIn a moment of need, I didn’t even have the words to ask my friend to pray for me. But Paul’s letter reminds me that gospel community is the life we’re called to. Paul knew firsthand that when we experience fellowship within the body of Christ, we are experiencing the very kingdom of God. “I know that when I come to you,” he said to his fellow believers in Rome, “I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ” (Romans 15:29). Then he asked for their prayers. \n\nMay we be a people who confess aloud how much we need Jesus, and push one another back into His presence. We don’t simply write postcards from a distance and wish one another luck or prosperity. No, we have the honor of inviting each other to encounter the living God, the giver of salvation and peace.\n\nMelissa Zaldivar is a social in the world of academics and an academic in the world of socials.

With brave intentions and shy tendencies, she’s perfected the art of introducing herself, yet allows her next-door neighbor to call her the wrong name yet again.

And her best friend, states away, knows she’s always on call for both late night and early morning pep talks.\n\nI’ve been the new girl enough times to know what makes her feel welcome. Paul has a pretty good idea, too. After all, he could have easily ended the book of Romans with chapter 15, one of the biggest mic-drop opportunities of all time. Instead, he reintroduces us to the gift God gave us in each other. \n\nAfter “amen,” Paul continues on with a crucial reminder: we are not alone. He introduces us to his friends by name, explaining their significance and telling us why we’ll love them. \n\nPhoebe, whom Paul reminds us is already our sister, is on her way to Rome (and may be the one carrying his letter!). He encourages us to befriend her and take care of her during her stay. Priscilla and Aquila, more dear friends, put themselves on the line for our buddy Paul. So, of course, we’re honored to greet them and their church. The list goes on and on, and as it grows, Paul continues to build up God’s people with encouragement, delivering each name as a lifeline to the full body.\n\nIn this intimate portrait of Paul and his fellow believers, we see a lasting truth: The body of Christ is a built-in reminder that redemption is an extraordinary reality for everyday people. \n\nIt’s easy to misread the Bible as “The Book of People Who Had It All Together,” when really, there’s only one Hero in this story. The simple truth is that we all need Jesus, and we all need each other. \n\nIn Romans, Paul emphasizes that God’s plan is good news. But his writing isn’t just for well-versed theologians—it’s for ordinary, faithful people living in small, unseen obedience. It’s for us. If you are in Christ, your name is written there among the greatness and glory of God’s plan.\n\nHere in our temporary home, we never stop being the new girl who needs to relearn grace and remember truth. But praise the Lord—we don’t have to do it alone. \n\nGreetings, friends. And peace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus (1 Peter 5:14).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 16:17-27, Matthew 7:15-20, Jude 24-25\n\nI took a personality test the other day, and I wasn’t thrilled with the results. It confirmed what I already knew: I avoid conflict like the plague. Put me in a tension-filled room and I’ll moonwalk away so fast, you’ll never even know I was there.\n\nI tell you this not to confirm that I was raised in the 80s (which I was), but so you’ll understand why I so desperately want to misinterpret today’s passage from Romans. I’ll show you what I mean.\n\nHere we’ve come to the close of the longest of Paul’s letters. We’ve heard him preach on sin and salvation, grace and faith, and now we’re leaning in to see how he’ll land the plane. What does one say to wrap up what would become known as the most comprehensive expression of the gospel in all of Scripture?\n\nHe begins his conclusion with a warning:\n\nNow I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who create divisions and obstacles contrary to the teaching that you learned. Avoid them… (Romans 16:17).\n\nThis is where my comfort-loving ears perk up. Steer clear of those who cause problems? Avoid conflict at all costs? If that’s what our friend Paul is selling, I’m buying in bulk. But he continues:\n\n…because such people do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites. They deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting with smooth talk and flattering words (v. 18).\n\nNo smooth-talkers allowed? Yep, works for me.\n\nIn my humanity, I want Paul’s words to leave me right where I am: a well-intentioned gal who doesn’t like to rattle or be rattled. I want a divine endorsement for a head-down, hands-off way of living. I want to look to the folks on my right and my left and say, I’m fine. You’re fine. Everything’s fine. In short, I want to read Paul’s words as permission rather than admonition.\n\nHe keeps writing:\n\nThe report of your obedience has reached everyone. Therefore I rejoice over you, but I want you to be wise about what is good, and yet innocent about what is evil. The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you (vv.19-20).\n\nCrushing evil is not a passive activity. Our holy and sovereign God is currently and constantly at work, overcoming darkness with light (John 5:17). As Christ followers, our work is not passive either. We are called to right doctrine and right living—to cling to Christ and to His gospel, shunning all false gods and gospels that beg our worship. This is Paul’s parting reminder.\n\nIt’s true that I’m predisposed to being a coaster—a person who’d rather stay the course than question questionable coordinates. But the gospel Paul presents in this letter is not a matter of right or left. It’s a matter of life and death. The mystery of Jesus Christ has been “revealed and made known through the prophetic Scriptures, according to the command of the eternal God” (Romans 16:26). Our Savior has come. He has opened the way to God, the rescue and restoration of our wrecked, restless souls.\n\nThe truth is, you and I are not fine. We “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). But in God’s great love and compassion, we have been “justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Romans 3:24). What’s more, “since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). \n\nThis is the gospel. This is our hope. \n\nThis is what we cling to, what we live by, what we fight for—to the glory of the One who created us, saved us, and calls us His own.\n\nTo the only wise God, through Jesus Christ—to him be the glory forever! Amen (Romans 16:27).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nNot everyone makes dinners from scratch. Nor do they set the table while singing folk songs in four-part harmony, no less. No, not everyone does these things. But the Trudeau family does. And years ago, when disease broke into their family, my friends still continued to welcome people into their home, investing great care and attention into making their space a refuge since so much of their time would be spent there due to illness. \n\nReceiving an invitation to dinner at the Trudeaus’ home is special because there are just so many things for them to juggle on an average night, let alone one with company—a warm hearth for cold bodies, hand-crafted dairy-free dressings, detoxifying herbal tea, gentle noise levels. But their home has always been a warm place because this family is the essence of hospitality. When you leave, it feels like you’ve actually been touched by grace and peace. Not merely abstract concepts on a page, grace and peace are felt in the Trudeaus’ home—as real as the gift of hospitality, evidenced by their thoughtfulness and intention, not to mention the gloriously sautéed pork chops or a round of acapella sing-a-longs.\n\nIn Paul’s letter to the Philippians, he begins by giving them something: “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (Philippians 1:2). It may seem like a simple greeting, similar to “Hello!” or “Nice to see you!” But the phrase carries more spiritual depth along with it. In Paul’s day, letters were the primary way to convey personal information from afar. It wasn’t like today, where you can text your relatives across the world or confess your love on Facebook Messenger and, best-case scenario, hear back within the hour. Because writing and sending letters required valuable commodities, there was often more intentionality behind it. \n\nPaul’s message to the believers in Philippi was even more important because his words were the closest he could get to being there with them in person. Being imprisoned, he wanted to thank this church for their financial support and faithful friendship, for being his partners in the gospel (Philippians 1:5). And after personally experiencing the grace of God and His peace that surpassed all understanding (Philippians 4:7), Paul desired for his brothers and sisters in Christ to experience these things too.\n\nWhen Paul wrote to the saints in Philippi, he extended a spiritual blessing. Both “grace” and “peace” were common salutations in Paul’s day, but he reimagined the phrase and used it to remind his readers of the gifts already imparted to them by God’s Spirit. By greeting fellow believers in this way, Paul encouraged them to remember what was theirs in Christ Jesus. \n\nMay we seize these blessings from Paul’s church greeting, remembering that grace and peace are real and active gifts that the Father gives to us through the Holy Spirit and makes accessible through His Son. They are ours today, if only we would receive them. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nEarly into this past Advent season, I wrote letters until the ring finger on my right hand blistered. For two days straight, I wrote cards of gratitude and joy for each of the volunteers in the children’s ministry I lead, followed by cards filled with stickers and sweet words for every child (ages three and over) in my ministry. In each child’s card, I wrote a variation on a similar theme, but all had the same conclusion: “I hope you always remember how much Jesus loves you.”\n\nI assume these cards were tossed aside in the holiday hubbub, or purged in the seemingly requisite January clean-out that most families undertake. As I wrote, I kept thinking, Do these words matter? Is it worth the time? Maybe the cards matter, maybe they don’t, but I know the words on them do. And every time I penned that phrase, I prayed the child who received the card would take it to heart. \n\nPaul’s letter to the Philippians starts with similar sentiments, echoing ancient truths and the hope that the words within the letter would sink down deep into the hearts of those who would read it. This opening exhortation to his readers in Philippi offers a template for godly relationships of believers deeply committed to sharing the love of Christ. Paul expressed gratitude for the Philippians, “for every remembrance” of them (Philippians 1:3), as well as their partnership in the spread of the gospel. \n\nPaul has a history with the Philippians, and it is on this rich foundation that he builds this really beautiful letter. In Acts 16, we see that when Paul first came to Philippi, a woman called Lydia was converted to faith, and then she and her family invited Paul to stay with them. Their generous hospitality was marked by open ears, open hearts, and open homes. \n\nLater in the chapter, Paul and Silas were arrested, and in the end, the Lord delivered them from prison. However, during their imprisonment, one of their jailers became a believer, and also welcomed Paul and Silas to his home: “He brought them into his house, set a meal before them, and rejoiced because he had come to believe in God with his entire household” (Acts 16:34). \n\nPaul seems to care very deeply for the Philippians. As modern readers, we know the rest of this letter will hold both caution and affection. But this beautiful opening reveals the heart and intent behind Paul’s words. We see in these verses how godly relationships work when they are anchored in love for the gospel; there is push and pull, earnest prayer, and deep care for one other’s true well-being and spiritual growth. \n\nAs I write, I see the faces of those believers who I know I can cling to with the same godly affection Paul has for the Philippians, who balance their love for me with their desire for me to grow more like Jesus every day. They aren’t afraid to whisper (or shout) rebuke in love, and they bathe their strong words in prayer for my sanctification. These people have partnered with me in the hard work of sharing the gospel with a world that has become increasingly hostile toward it. \n\nI am so thankful for these friends, and today I pray for them in the same way Paul prayed for his friends in Philippi: “that [their] love will keep on growing in knowledge and every kind of discernment,” and that they would “be pure and blameless in the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God” (Philippians 1:9–11). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nYears ago, I gave a talk about fear and anxiety. About thirty women settled into a cozy room as I began sharing some of my story. Looking back on my childhood, I see a little girl who wanted to play it safe, who perpetually problem-solved worst-case scenarios, one who felt shadowed by a vague sense of fear. This stream of anxiety ran steadily throughout my life, but no one would have known. I was the kid who easily made friends, loved school, and didn’t cause much trouble. I was the strong, steady one—until I wasn’t.\n\nIn my late twenties, in the midst of young marriage and new motherhood, the stream of anxiety became a flood. Panic attacks began to torment me. For the first time, my underground anxiety burst out and threatened to take center stage. I felt embarrassed and ashamed. I didn’t want to admit my confusing fears, and I certainly didn’t want others to see my struggle. After all, I was supposed to be the strong, steady one. \n\nAt this point in my talk, I told the women that I had a secret. I began unbuttoning my shirt. Awkward silence filled the room. Underneath my faded, denim top I wore a white t-shirt and cold, bulky metal chains. No one had suspected that I was wearing chains, yet they were there the whole time—pinching, constraining, and weighing me down. We don’t always know the chains people are wrapped up in, do we?\n\nThe apostle and missionary Paul wore chains too. In his letter to the believers in the city of Philippi, Paul explains that he is “in chains for Christ” as he endures house arrest (Philippians 1:13 NIV). For years he has been misunderstood, criticized, slandered, and beaten, and now he is jailed in Rome. \n\nSome could view Paul as a failure. Some could question his faith or even the power or goodness of God. Yet Paul is convinced that his current suffering is nothing to be ashamed of or to hide. On the contrary, he insists that his circumstances advance the gospel message. He tells the Philippians, “Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly” (Philippians 1:14 NIV). Even in jail, Paul rejoices that his guards are hearing about Jesus and that other believers are encouraged and empowered. \n\nWe may marvel at Paul’s perspective, but let’s not romanticize our chains. In 1 Corinthians 2, Paul reveals his weakness, fear, and trembling (v.3). We all chafe and wrestle with painful circumstances, those things we would never choose for ourselves, yet God still allows. \n\nWhat pinches you, constrains you, or weighs you down? Our anxieties, our fears, our sufferings are heavy and costly. But we don’t have to hide them or be ashamed. Even our struggles can deepen our dependence on Christ and point others to the one who walks us through our darkest valleys and who redeems us—chains and all. \n\nPatti Sauls lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband Scott and daughters, Abby and Ellie, where they serve alongside the people of Christ Presbyterian Church.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\n“So, have I missed anything during my Twitter vacation?” I asked my husband, half joking, half serious. Every January, I take an annual social media break. Whatever I call this—a fast, a disappearance, a protest, a spiritual practice, an act of self-care—I’m always astonished how the break makes my world feel quieter. It’s sobering to notice how I’m being shaped by the constant noise of life online. And I wonder how Jesus might be calling all of us to a better, humbler way.\n\nIn His letter to the church at Philippi, Paul has quite a bit to say on the subject of humility. He writes, “Consider others as more important than yourselves” (Philippians 2:3), before drawing comparisons to Jesus Himself in 2:5–7. \n\nIf this tempts you to empty yourself into silence or challenges your natural fighter instinct, please know this isn’t an invitation to be passive. Jesus was a man who frequently challenged power, debating religious leaders and touching the unclean, and defending the dignity of people on the margins of life. So no, humility isn’t about shrinking into invisibility. There are certainly things worth fighting for.\n\nPerhaps humility is more of a posture. And if humility is our posture and Christ is our example, then we can walk in love and know how to respond when we come up against the messiness of the world, acting from a place of love and security rather than reacting. We can know when to rage against the darkness and when to be still.\n\nWe can also learn when to sit and listen. We can fight the darkness while honoring each other’s humanity. We can acknowledge that even the corrupt and the cruel are loved by a God who grieves for them, who longs to lead them out of the darkness and welcome them as sons and daughters.\n\nSo, the social media thing? You don’t have to scroll far to see the human tendency to posture with pride. I see it when I ask a question and I’m already planning what to say next. I see it when my love for a person cools because I don’t like their behavior online. I see it when we slip into performative debates for the cultural currency of likes and retweets.\n\nIn life online and off, what would it look like to look out for the interests of others before my own? How might we learn to consider others with more importance, even when we disagree? What kinds of questions ought we learn to ask before we speak? And how will it empower us to know when our words really matter?\n\nQuestions like these might help to foster humility. And no doubt, we need the help because humility is a hard way. But it’s also one we don’t have to walk alone.\n\nJen Rose Yokel is a poet, writer, a spiritual director in training, and a contributing writer at The Rabbit Room.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nIt was an early morning in June when I logged into my work computer at our university library. I hadn’t been online for more than a minute before seeing tributes pouring in from church leaders, moms, and others whose lives have been enriched by this one woman and her heart for God. Elisabeth Elliot had died. \n\nElisabeth’s writing helped guide my spiritual formation after I stumbled across her work somewhere around the age of twenty years old. An American missionary, wife, author, and speaker, she was a modest saint, one who would never call attention to herself. She saw our lives as “chalices” or “empty vessels willing and ready to be filled with the life of God.” But on this June morning, people seemed to think it right to honor her long walk of faithfulness. \n\nDuring his missionary journeys, the apostle Paul honored his ministry partners in a similar way by speaking well of them. When he wrote to groups like the one in Philippi, he vouched for his friends and elevated their good qualities so there would be no question of their credibility. Timothy was a “like-minded” man doing the Lord’s work with “proven character” (Philippians 2:20, 22; 1 Corinthians 16:10). Epaphroditus was his “brother” who should be welcomed with “great joy” (Philippians 2:25, 29). Paul also asked these churches to recognize and hold in high regard those among them who were risking their lives for the kingdom (1 Thessalonians 5:12–13). \n\nJesus tells us, “You will have suffering in the world.” (John 16:33). I’ve always found it strange when we describe life as having seasons of trials and tribulations. Instead of life being a static plane of serenity with intermittent times of trial, it sometimes seems that life itself is the trial with intermittent times of serenity. One thing that gives us strength while following Jesus is our friendship with others and their encouragement on the journey. \n\nI hope people pointed out the good they saw in Elisabeth Elliot while she was alive. I imagine that her modest personality was challenged now and then by opportunities to focus on affirmation from others. But even if not, I hope her story inspires us to follow Paul’s model and affirm the God-honoring qualities we see in our brothers and sisters. This isn’t to draw self-serving attention or make them arrogant; it’s an opportunity to build up the Body of Christ in a world so often marked by anything but serenity.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nWhen my husband was in business school, he had to develop an “elevator pitch” as part of his job search. An elevator pitch is a fairly standard business practice with the goal of selling something (a business idea, a person for a job, or a product) in the amount of time it takes you to ride an elevator with someone. For my husband and his fellow students, the idea was simple. At career fairs with large companies who hired the best and brightest from top business schools, you need to make yourself stand out in thirty seconds or less: say who you are, why you are different, and why you can bring unique value to the company. \n\nIn the first eleven verses of Philippians 3, Paul offers his own succinct and beautiful elevator pitch for gospel transformation. He lays it all out, right there: who he was, who he is now, and why it matters.\n\nSo who was Paul? He was the Hebrew born of Hebrews, who said of himself, “If anyone else thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I have more” (Philippians 3:4). Paul, a Pharisee whose life mission was to persecute and kill Christians, had all the right answers. He followed the law, which he knew backward and forward and to the letter. \n\nBut when confronted firsthand and face to face with the truth of who Jesus really is, Paul declared, “Everything that was a gain to me, I have considered to be a loss because of Christ” (v.7). Despite the perfect resumé, the right pedigree, the unflappable credentials—Paul had nothing to offer before God. What a radical gospel transformation Paul experienced! It’s incredible, his confidence in the gift of grace that Christ offers to us. \n\nI often feel so very lost in the darkness of my own sin. I know I have nothing to offer, despite my best efforts. But this confidence Paul describes? I don’t always believe it is available to me, too. My brain and its twisted paths of anxiety, fear, too many words and not enough faith, often lead me down the road of relying on my own flesh. I reason, I’m not good enough for God, but if I work harder, read my Bible more, pray more, be nicer to people, maybe then I’ll become more like Christ.\n\nBut here, in his eleven-verse elevator pitch for the gospel, Paul reminds me again that those thoughts are not true. My righteousness cannot come from my own flesh or from the law, but only through faith in Christ (vv.9–10). Jeremiah 9:23–24 echoes the same promise: \n\nThe wise person should not boast in his wisdom;  the strong should not boast in his strength;  the wealthy should not boast in his wealth.  But the one who boasts should boast in this:  that he understands and knows me— that I am the LORD.\n\nHe is the Lord, mighty to save and full of abounding grace. What He requires from us is a desire “to know Him and the power of His resurrection” (Philippians 3:10), a power that is available to all who receive the gospel of grace. May we remember, and always be thankful for, the privilege of being able to stand on the merit of Christ alone. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nThere’s a quote attributed to Maya Angelou that somehow gives comfort to my inner critic: “I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.” I’m not sure if these are actual words written by Dr. Angelou or if it’s one of those quotes that has been passed around so much on Instagram nobody knows the true source. But wherever it comes from, I like it. Something in it resonates with me, an echo of much-needed grace.\n\nI’d like to think this is a message someone in the church at Phillippi needed to hear when Paul’s letter came to town. In Philippians, Paul isn’t writing to correct an issue or fight a dangerous teaching. Instead, he’s sent an extended thank-you letter, a note of encouragement, and a rally to keep going.\n\nMetaphors about running races and winning prizes aren’t all that unusual in Paul’s writing, but if we look a bit more closely, we’ll find the words of a gentle, loving coach here. His letter to the Philippians includes a heartfelt thank you for their support, and the reminder that there is still so much work to do for the kingdom (Philippians 1:21–24). He points to Jesus’s obedience unto literal death as the ultimate example of humility (Philippians 2:8), a stark contradiction to his own list of credentials for “confidence in the flesh,” which is enough to make any zealous striver or recovering perfectionist wither. It’s also a false confidence Paul now recognizes as utterly empty (Philippians 3:4–6). His priorities have changed. \n\nYes, there is work. There is effort. There is a goal to pursue, a race to run, a job to do (Philippians 3:12–13). But look for the grace between the words: there is no striving in his words. Paul calls this way of thinking a mark of maturity—the realization that all we need is God. This is not the anxious striving to appease an angry Father. This is not fearfully walking on eggshells. Instead, Paul appeals to his readers’ identity as “citizens of heaven,” and encourages them to “live up to whatever truth we have [already] attained” (Philippians 1:27; 3:16).\n\nAnd so, there is the tension: to work hard for God’s purposes, but trust that Christ has taken hold of us. To embrace our identity as kingdom citizens, while knowing we won’t live this life perfectly, nor could we ever earn our way back into a right relationship with God. To be content where we are while seeking to grow, and trusting that when the time is right, the Holy Spirit will reveal truth and nudge us in the direction that will lead us to look more like Jesus. “Forgetting what is behind and reaching forward to what is ahead,” we learn to pursue the ultimate prize: Christ Jesus Himself (Philippians 3:13–14).\n\nWe grow. We learn. We know better. We do better. Until the day we step into the kingdom and the breeze on our faces feels like home.\n\nJen Rose Yokel is a poet, writer, a spiritual director in training, and a contributing writer at The Rabbit Room.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nThe blaring siren and flashing blue lights jerked me out of my daydream. How fast was I driving, anyway? Turns out I was cruising along at 53 miles an hour in a 40-mile-an-hour zone. And it wasn’t the first time. There’s a reason my dad often told me I had “a lead foot.” This time, the police officer was firm yet gracious. He urged me to keep my speed down, but let me off with a warning instead of a costly ticket. \n\nI may sometimes be too speedy, but nothing compared to Mario Andretti, the professional racecar driver. He would regularly race at speeds over 200 miles an hour. When asked for a racing tip, he quipped, “Don’t look at the wall.” His point was that a driver’s car follows what he is focused on. Where you look is where you go. If you keep looking at the wall, you’ll crash into it.\n\nIn his letter to the church in Philippi, Paul is urging the impressionable believers to keep their focus on Christ. Paul longs for them to flourish in the faith, not to crash into walls of false teaching. In chapter 2, Paul warns the church against legalism. This deception rejected the sufficiency of Christ’s righteousness that comes from God through faith. Then and now, legalistic thinking insists that it’s a person’s best efforts and striving that make them right with God and with other people. I crash into a wall of legalism when I assume God merely tolerates me instead of remembering that He deeply delights in me as His beloved daughter. I crash when I’m critical and judge others for not meeting my personal expectations and preferences.\n\nIn chapter 3, Paul warns against another danger. While speeding away from the wall of legalism, some may over-correct and ricochet into the wall of licentiousness. This deception insists on throwing off moral restraint in hopes of satisfying all appetites and desires. “Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is their shame,” says Paul (Philippians 3:19). Licentiousness says “anything goes,” that if it feels good, you should do it. I crash into a wall of licentiousness when I pridefully believe that I’m above temptation and fail to recognize my need for God’s good boundaries. I crash when I foolishly allow my desires to drive me to do things that hurt myself and hurt others.\n\nAt the root of all legalism and licentiousness is a worship of self above all else. Paul is, in essence, warning, “Don’t look at the wall!” Where you look is where you go. When we focus on ourselves, it’s not long before we crash. But this does not need to rule us. We can stand firm in the Lord as we remember that our true citizenship, our true allegiance, is in heaven with God (Philippians 3:20). May the Lord capture our hearts and affections, enabling us to focus on Him, worshiping Him alone. The One who made us is also the only One who can save us. Only He truly satisfies our deepest longings and desires, and only He can safely lead us home.\n\nPatti Sauls lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband Scott and daughters, Abby and Ellie, where they serve alongside the people of Christ Presbyterian Church.

She gave me a hug and said, “Mom, look at the things you have finished, not the things you haven’t.” In essence, the Lord was graciously reminding me, through my daughter, to “rejoice in the Lord always”—in everything—even while in the midst of a list of to-dos (Philippians 4:4). \n\nAs daughters of the King, rather than living in worry and fear, we can rejoice in “the riches of his grace that he richly poured out on us with all wisdom and understanding” (Ephesians 1:8–9). I don’t know about you, but so often, I live in and wrestle with worry. When I hear that command to rejoice, I fall into discouragement because I know my life’s not marked by rejoicing. Paul was in prison when he wrote “Rejoice!” So why can’t I rejoice where I am today? I spin my wheels trying to figure out how to cultivate a life of joy and peace. Today’s reading reminds me that the answers to how we live this life of faith are found in God’s Word. \n\nGod knows how to bring us peace because He is the God of peace (Philippians 4:9). He knows what will bring us true joy. He is always near, and so there’s no reason to worry; His peace will guard our hearts and minds (vv.5–9). \n\nWe cannot add one moment to our days by worrying, and so we are to set our minds on the Spirit, who offers us “life and peace” (Matthew 6:27; Romans 8:6). Whatever is true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, commendable—these are the things we should dwell on (Philippians 4:8). All of these things and more we are able to receive through His Spirit and His Word; He uses both to draw us to Himself.\n\nWill we continue to worry, to set our minds on things of the flesh? Yes, we may always struggle with that. But we are saved by grace, works in progress; the One who’s begun a good work in us will carry it on to completion (Philippians 1:6). And that is truly a great cause for rejoicing, because “as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us” (Psalm 103:12). Wherever we find ourselves today—even in dark seasons and in overwhelming situations—we can rest in Him and rejoice because the gospel is true.\n\nKimberly Girard is a well-loved child of God, wife of an extraordinary man, mother of three amazing kids, and writer living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nSome call it “liminal space,” the time or space between what has been and what lies ahead. It might be a time of waiting or even transformation. These places can be painful or beautiful: a time of singleness or the joyful, anticipated waiting during engagement. The days of longing for children or the day after the youngest leaves for college. The darkness of depression or the lifting of anxiety. In these uncertain places, how can we learn to be content?\n\nIt’s likely that Paul wrote his famous declaration of contentment from inside the walls of a Roman prison, and yet his words brim with gratitude. His friends in Philippi were concerned, doing what they could to help him, and he acknowledged that just knowing they care is enough. He tells them, “I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I find myself. I know both how to make do with little, and I know how to make do with a lot” (Philippians 4:11–12). In other words, “Thanks for your concern, but don’t worry! I’m going to be okay.”\n\nIn this letter, Paul is warm and optimistic, shifting the focus off of himself to encourage a church. His words radiate joy and humility bound up in a deep truth. Contentment doesn’t lie in comfort, and it doesn’t even lie in freedom. In this liminal space between living free or dying a brutal death, Paul shares this secret from behind bars: “I am able to do all things through Him who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13).\n\nIn our own liminal spaces, maybe we can find a little bit of that strength too. Not in a naively optimistic way that ignores or denies reality, but in a solid confidence that someday this, too—everything, really—will be made right. And in this contentment, we can take the steps we need toward the changes we desire, from making friends in a new city, to scheduling a doctor appointment, to leaning on Him to get up and take each day one step at a time.\n\nConsider the journey of a caterpillar becoming a butterfly. This old metaphor of free-flying beauty springing forth from a squirmy, leaf-munching creature can sound a little cliché. But there’s a reason this image resonates and endures. The caterpillar doesn’t just spin a little capsule and pop out fully formed. It liquifies to a death-like state. It waits. It struggles to tear out of its chrysalis, strengthening its wings so it can fly. Stop the process too soon, or attempt to help a butterfly escape, and it’s over. Every step of the process is vital. \n\nPerhaps our own waiting spaces are like that. Changing, struggling, and finding contentment in the shelter of God—over and over again, until we are made completely new. But regardless of the space we currently inhabit, whether moving forward in a joyful burst of enthusiasm or in a seemingly endless season of waiting—we are not alone. “In any and all circumstances,” we already know the secret of being content: Jesus Christ is our peace. And by His Spirit we are strengthened and equipped, enabling us to do all things.\n\nJen Rose Yokel is a poet, writer, a spiritual director in training, and a contributing writer at The Rabbit Room.

As a senior in college I enrolled in a sculpture class—while majoring in German. I understand words, but I do not understand shapes. Trying to sculpt a three-dimensional representation of the human head turned out to be the only collegiate task that could reliably make me cry. I could not comprehend how to shape the turn of a lip or the curve of a nose. The rest of the class would talk about differing angles or closing one eye while looking at the model, but it was an impenetrable mystery to me.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews is trying to explain something completely different to an audience of Jewish Christians who were already being persecuted for their faith. Though they were believers, the concept of Jesus as Messiah was something would have been difficult to imagine until about 70 years prior, when Jesus was born. Some knew He was the Savior, although what that meant to them varied and was still largely misunderstood. The author is still trying to introduce us to this nearly incomprehensible concept: the God-Man. Without talking down to the reader, he explains clearly, from the very beginning, the nature of this strange and wonderful person who is both God and man.\n\nIn the first chapter of Hebrews, the writer essentially asks the question, What is the nature of the Son? and what’s more, Why does the nature of the Son matter? \n\nFirst, the Son replaces the prophets and fulfills their prophecies. He is both the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of God’s nature. Worthy of all worship, He is superior to the angels and remains the same forever (Hebrews 1:3–11). Indeed, God “has spoken to us by his Son” and “has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him” (vv.1–2). \n\nHow awesome is Christ, the Son! And yet this very Christ, the creator and sustainer of the world, is also the One who purifies us from our sin by His own sacrifice. He speaks directly to us and acts on our behalf—the same God whom all the fiery angels serve! Both the new covenant and the eternal priesthood of Christ are the unfathomable gift of God to a sinful people in need of a Savior.\n\nWithout Christ there is an overwhelming barrier between us and God, between our sinfulness and His holiness. But in Christ we find an even more overwhelming answer. We cannot comprehend the greatness of His glory or the awesomeness of His majesty, yet in Christ we are made daughters and heirs of His kingdom, having been washed clean by His blood.\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her five little people.

But today’s passage in Hebrews starts with a verse containing the conjunctive adverb, “therefore” (the CSB translates it “for this reason”), so a little grammar ditty may help remind us what exactly a conjunction is and, well, how it functions. \n\nLike a regular conjunction (such as “and” or “but”), a conjunctive adverb connects two words or clauses; however, it also shows the relationship between two ideas. Therefore, the author of Hebrews must be trying to draw a connection for us between two related thoughts. While we can assume the writer didn’t set out to begin the chapter this way (chapters weren’t added to the Bible until the 1200s), we can look back to the preceding chapter to see what the first idea is.\n\nIn chapter 1, the author establishes that Jesus is the Son of God, and that He is superior to the angels in authority, as Creator, and in His role as the author of our salvation. In chapter 2, we read that because Jesus is superior to the angels, believers should hold tight to their belief in Him (v.1). That while He is superior to everything and everyone we could ever imagine, He is also the God who remembers us and cares for us (v.6). \n\nAt the time of this letter, the original audience of Hebrews was in danger of walking away from their faith. They were persecuted, misunderstood, and targeted for their belief in Jesus Christ. And so the author is writing a book-long defense of believing in Jesus, beginning with this one conjunctive adverb: therefore or\n\nbecause.\n\nBecause Jesus is superior to the angels…\n\nBecause His gospel is better than the Law given to Moses…\n\nBecause Jesus is co-equal with God, but also because He became fully man…\n\nBecause of His signs and wonders and miracles…\n\nBecause everything is subjected under His feet…\n\nBecause of His suffering and death—\n\nListen! Don’t drift away. \n\nThe temptation to drift away was not just a concern for this audience of Jewish Christians; it is real for all of us, all of the time. From the ancient believers who found themselves facing death or being treated as outcasts because of their faith, to modern-day believers like us who struggle to believe for a myriad reasons, this passage in Hebrews reminds us that our faith is anchored in the person and work of Jesus. \n\nAll of Hebrews sings this song: Jesus is who He said He was, and He is who God promised He would be. Therefore, we believe.\n\nMelanie Rainer is a bookworm from birth who makes her days writing, editing, and reading in Nashville, where she also joyfully serves as the editor of Kids Read Truth.

We’d just made an offer on the place and were giving my husband’s family a tour when his grandpa (affectionately known to us as Papaw) said, “I remember when I built this house.” \n\nWe bumped into each other at the base of our oak staircase banister as if someone had just pulled an invisible emergency break, bringing the tour to an abrupt stop.\n\n“You built this house?” we asked, astounded. \n\nOur home was built long before either of us was born. Papaw was a much younger man then, running his own contractor business. We’d picked out our house online and made an offer on the spot without even considering who had laid the foundation so many years before. The idea that we had chosen a home carefully constructed by a man who chose to love us was a precious dose of unexpected grace.  \n\nPapaw is gone now and we are blessed to remember him every time we run our hands down the banister he installed, shuffle our socked feet across the hardwood floors he laid, or gaze out the large picture window he set into place. Our house is more sacred to us because of whose hands swung the hammer that put it together. \n\nIn today’s passages, the writer of Hebrews is asking his readers to lift their eyes off of Moses and onto the Greater One. We might not fixate so much on the greatness of Moses these days, but we do tend to treasure the wrong prize. A cosmic shift occurs in our souls when we acknowledge that everything we love and treasure ultimately belongs to God. It all matters because He matters so much. “Now every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God” (Hebrews 3:4). \n\nThis circles back and underscores a thought from the second chapter of Hebrews. We find it sandwiched between two commas, yet it deserves its own exclamation point: “For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, is bringing so many sons to glory…” (v.10). \n\nWe hear it in the words of Colossians 1: “For everything was created by him, in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things have been created through him and for him” (v.16). \n\nAnd we see it again in the first chapter of John’s Gospel. It reads: “All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created” (v.3). \n\nIt’s tempting to think we’re the ones buildings something here: We’re building a family. We’re building a career. We’re building a home. But all of these things are God’s handiwork; they are already His. He crafted it long ago—every beam, every person, every bloom. \n\nJust like the Hebrews, we tend to elevate the message over the Messiah, the prophet over the High Priest, the creation above the Creator. But Scripture pulls an invisible emergency break on this tour of our pride. How much better it is to trust in the Builder than in the building (Hebrews 2:13). Our lives become more precious and our hands more open when we acknowledge that it’s all His—made by Him and for Him, and given to us to enjoy as His beloved children. \n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 3:7-19, John 3:16-21, Romans 11:1-6\n\nHands down, my favorite day of the year during elementary school was field day. On field day, each class wore matching t-shirts and competed in outdoor events like the 100-yard dash, Red Rover, and the ultimate team challenge: tug-of-war.\n\nI always felt a rush of nerves as my class stepped up to the rope to compete against the other classes in our grade. I was tall and lanky, not the strongest kid, but I knew none of that mattered in tug-of-war, because it took everyone’s strength to win, not just mine. And when I got tired, I could loosen my grip knowing my classmates would pick up the slack.\n\nOur passage today points to this type of teamwork—not in the context of field day, of course, but in the context of faith and the community effort it so often requires.\n\nWe can assume some individuals from the community addressed in Hebrews had been loosening their grip on their faith, swaying toward unbelief, the type of unbelief that leads to rebellion against God. The writer warns, “Watch out, brothers and sisters, so that there won’t be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God” (Hebrews 3:12).\n\nAs God’s people, we have a long history of this type of unbelief. From the Israelites wandering in the desert, to the early church addressed here in Hebrews, to Christians today—our tendency is to believe in ourselves and our own way over God and His. Fortunately, the writer of Hebrews provides a strategy to guard ourselves against unbelief: \n\n“But encourage each other daily, while it is still called today,\n\nso that none of you is hardened by sin’s deception” (v.13).\n\nIn other words, if you want to stay away from unbelief, stay together.\n\nThe more I walk this road of faith, the more I realize how corporate the practice of faith must be if we are going to maintain it. The very nature of our faith is communal. We serve a triune God who from the beginning has been committed to communing with us. So much so, that He came to be with us in human form through the person of Jesus Christ, who then died so that we might commune with God for eternity.\n\nWe are not meant to believe alone. I think this is why the writer of Hebrews so earnestly warns against unbelief, and then in the same breath reminds us to encourage one another. When I am on the brink of unbelief, it is always community that pulls me back to the truth of the gospel. If I’d had to face the other team alone, I surely would have abandoned the rope long ago. But knowing I have others there who have strength when I don’t has provided the encouragement I’ve needed to stay in the game.  \n\nThis is why I find this passage so hopeful. Just as much as it is a warning against unbelief, it is also a reminder that we don’t have to go up against unbelief alone. Because our Messiah is our companion, we have companionship with each other.\n\nAndrea Lucado is a freelance writer, Texas native, and the author of the memoir English Lessons: The Crooked Path of Growing Toward Faith.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 4:1-13, Psalm 95:7-11, 1 Peter 1:3-5\n\nThe promised rest.\n\nIn today’s busy culture, especially in the United States, that phrase seems too good to be true. I tend to crave rest in different ways, depending on the season I’m in. When I was in college, running myself ragged, I would have given anything for a quick cat nap during the day, but now I just long for a solid eight hours of sleep at night. \n\nThe kind of rest described in Hebrews chapter 4 is not the nap our bodies beg for after a busy day. God invited the Israelites into His rest, into the Sabbath, when they were wandering in the wilderness. However, they rebelled and did not enter into His rest because of their disobedient, discontented hearts. We are offered this same rest; it is promised to us because of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross. But the full Sabbath, the truest rest promised to us by God, will not occur until we are face to face with our Maker in eternity. \n\nIn the meantime, of course, God gives us a Sabbath each week—a day to rest, reconnect with God, and recenter our lives around Him. But if I’m honest, a real Sabbath feels unattainable to me today. Maybe the busyness our culture has come to call “normal” speaks to our true priorities. Or maybe we’re just looking at the Sabbath through the wrong lens. \n\nWhat if practicing the Sabbath includes sinking our teeth into the things that provide us with a taste of heaven? What if it’s savoring the morning light as it streams through our curtains, or relishing the feeling of propping our feet up on the coffee table after a long day of work? What if rest comes in cherishing moments of laughter and tears with the people around us who pull us closer to Jesus? What if we were to breathe all of this in as it happens, thanking God for these things in the moment, with the knowledge that our ultimate rest—our eternal salvation—is secure in Christ?\n\nThe true rest we long for will not fully come this side of heaven. The author of Hebrews tells us “a Sabbath rest remains for God’s people” (4:9). He encourages us to “make every effort to enter that rest” (v.11). The price has already been paid by Jesus. The “effort” we now make is to remain in Him as He remains in us (John 15:4). So we continue the work He’s given us to do, living in the tension that the kingdom of God is here and now, but also still to come and greater than we can imagine. We keep leaning in to God for strength as He builds His kingdom through us. And we find Sabbath rest where we are, in the presence of God Most High.\n\nEllen Taylor was born and raised in sweet home Alabama, but has called Nashville home since 2013.

At one particular meeting, we listened to one of the “stars” of our youth group give a testimony about how he believed God was calling him to quit baseball and give all his time and energy to God. So he quit. His choice to make a big sacrifice was glorified and applauded. And I wondered, What is God calling me to sacrifice? What do I have to give up for Him to love me? What would be enough?\n\nOof.\n\nIt took me years to identify how traumatic that message was for me. Though I don’t aim to judge one person’s actions and how they follow the promptings of the Spirit, the glamorization of that choice was embedded in my mind. I lived in fear that if I didn’t sacrifice the things I loved to do or wear or make or buy, then I wasn’t doing enough for God. I thought He would punish me instead.\n\nAnd so I walked around afraid that God was going to take everything and everyone I loved away from me. I began to see my relationship with Him as a give-and-take where He only took, and I only gave. I didn’t know that is literally the opposite of what the Bible tells us.\n\nI didn’t understand that what I owe to God is more than I could ever give. I didn’t understand that “sacrificing” wouldn’t make me a better Christian. In fact, it wouldn’t make me a Christian at all. I didn’t understand that the debt I owe to God is because of my sin, and that Jesus is the only One who could pay it. Without Jesus, I was—and I am—helpless to stand before God.\n\nThe truth is God does require something for the payment of our sins, because His is a perfect justice. But thankfully, the balance of His mercy does not rest on me. It rests solely on Jesus, who “became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him” (Hebrews 5:9).\n\nThe closing verse of Edward Mote’s classic hymn, “My Hope is Built on Nothing Less,” says: Oh, may I then in Him be found, / dressed in His righteousness alone, / faultless to stand before the throne. Today’s passage from Hebrews beckons us to do the same, to “approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in time of need” (Hebrews 4:16).\n\nBoldness. Some translations say “with confidence,” which we have only in the security of Christ. We don’t have to approach the throne with fear, with everything we love bundled up to lay on an altar, thinking that what we have to offer is somehow going to be enough to pay for our sin—because it isn’t.\n\nOnly Jesus is enough.\n\nJesus is our Great High Priest (v.14). Traditionally, high priests would offer sacrifices to atone for the sins of the people and themselves, because they sinned too. But Jesus’s sinless perfection made His sacrifice the source of eternal salvation for everyone who would ever believe.\n\nThis is an eternal, unchanging truth: We are not enough. Only Christ’s righteousness allows us to approach God’s throne with confidence, to receive the grace and mercy He offers us.

I go to church (but only when all five of my kids aren’t sick). I read my Bible (unless I am very tired or very busy or extremely lazy). I pray (especially when I have lost my glasses). And I write about Scripture (because it’s my dream job and people pay me to do it). \n\nOkay, so I’m a great gal with some mixed motives. But here’s the trouble: It’s actually pretty possible to look like a believer, enjoy the fellowship of believers, and even do a lot of the right things externally, but still not touch the heart of the matter. It’s possible to do all of these things without maturing in the faith and truly knowing God. \n\nAll of these good works may make me think I’m a great gal. They can certainly look like the fruit of the gospel at work in my life. But Scripture tells us our works are dead when we depend on them for our salvation (Romans 3:27–4:5). The author of Hebrews is warning us to stop focusing on such “elementary teaching about Christ and go on to maturity” (Hebrews 6:1).\n\nNo matter how many orphanages you visit in Haiti, you cannot save yourself. No matter how many women you rescue out of slavery, you cannot rescue yourself. Christ alone saves us. His desire is that we grow in maturity by the Holy Spirit, working out our faith to full assurance, which is only found in Christ (v.11).\n\nIf we are keeping lists of our own merits, even if just in our heads and hearts, it is a real danger. We cannot work our way to righteousness. But the temptation to rely on our own merits is powerful. The Church is warned about this in no uncertain terms. If we seek after good works more than we desire Christ, we are in grave danger. Beware, lest we fall away and come short of salvation! Only Christ is sufficient to save.\n\nYet “God is not unjust; he will not forget [our] work and the love [we] demonstrated for his name by serving the saints—and by continuing to serve them” (v.10). When we look to Christ for our salvation, our humble doings flow from gratitude to the One who saves us. We love others because we imitate the One who is love (1 John 4:8). We serve because He is the servant of all. Our good works don’t earn our salvation; they are the result of our salvation, fruit born of the Holy Spirit at work in us (Galatians 5:22–23).\n\nLet us look beyond the work of our own hands and instead place our hope in Christ’s finished work on the cross. May we hear His call to daily repentance and obedience. And may our works flow out of total thankfulness to God, our Creator and Redeemer.\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her five little people.

Being in my mid-twenties, I’ve always believed this event would unfold naturally and gracefully decades from now, like a badge of honor for a seasoned and experienced woman. It did not happen that way. However, as I sifted through my dark brown strands to find the one that wasn’t, I couldn’t help but think of my grandmother. I’ve never gotten through a conversation with someone who knew Polly without mention of her rare poise, cheeks full of laughter, and of course, her beautiful silver hair.\n\nThere are some things I inherited right away from my grandmother, like the pearl earrings she’d received on a special anniversary and the cooking tools that still smelled like her house. I inherited her love for music, the same knack for penmanship, and a preference for extra-sour lemonade. And then there are things I didn’t know I’d get from Polly, even after she was gone—things like her fountain pen, which my aunt gave me because I became a writer, and the aforementioned early appearance of gray hairs.\n\nThere’s something about an inheritance that roots you in a sense of belonging. Or in some cases, you find out there’s been a place for you all along. In Hebrews 6, we find that our inheritance is both current and eternal. It is everything we need, exactly what we’d hoped, and all we never thought to ask for.\n\nI love how thorough God is in His promises. It’s as if He takes joy in watching His children read His Word and learn His Will, savoring each gift along the way. Two big themes in the book of Hebrews are revelation and redemption, and God’s covenant with His people is what bridges the two.\n\n“Because God wanted to show his unchangeable purpose even more clearly to the heirs of the promise, he guaranteed it with an oath, so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us” (Hebrews 6:17–18). Notice the two unchangeable things here: God’s promise and God’s oath. He wants to make doubly sure we know that our inheritance in Him is true.\n\nMaybe we don’t realize our inheritance through the way we age or through hand-me-downs in the cupboard, but just like He did for Abraham, God makes sure we know we’ve obtained the promise. He is the only One who can give us the sweetest inheritance of all: Himself. “We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure” (Hebrews 6:19). May we continue to hold fast to Him, our hope and our prize. Amen.\n\nKaitlin Wernet is a twenty-something who lives to tell stories with a backbone of hope.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 7:11-28, Genesis 14:18-20, 1 John 2:1\n\nI am raising four boys on a farm full of mud. \n\nThrough much threatening, cajoling, scrubbing and—okay, I’ll admit it—bribing, I can occasionally get everyone clean. But there isn’t enough soap and water in the universe to ensure that they will stay clean. Most often, we don’t even make it to the car before someone (or everyone) becomes more soiled than spiffed up. \n\nThe Levitical priests could surely more than feel my pain. Once a year they would go to great lengths to ask the Lord to clean out the record of sin accumulated by His people. After extensive preparations, a priest would enter the most holy place inside the veil to present a sin offering (Leviticus 16:2–34). Verse 30 tells us: “Atonement will be made for you on this day to cleanse you, and you will be clean from all your sins before the LORD.” And so when the priest exited, God’s people were clean. It was a holy scrubbing, but never a permanent one. \n\nYear after year, the priests would enter the tabernacle to atone for the people’s sins, only to return again a year later. This was not an exercise in futility, but God’s provisional means of covering their sin. It was also an object lesson for generations to come, teaching them that nothing we could ever do—no matter how meticulously planned and executed—to make these “filthy rags” clean. We can scrub and scrub and scrub and the muck of sin will stick to us, making it impossible for us to be in the presence of our holy, holy, holy God (Revelation 4:8).  \n\nSo we keep scouring, don’t we? Until our hearts and souls feel raw from the effort. We need the reminder that we cannot obtain perfection through human striving. God’s law doesn’t polish us up to a high shine; instead, it exposes every gritty imperfection (v.19). \n\nThe priests couldn’t keep us clean because they were stained by sin too. We’ve always been the blind leading the blind, the stained scrubbing the stained. We needed someone untarnished by sin to enter the Holy Place on our behalf. “For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens” (v.26). Christ is the true high priest, and His is the superior priesthood. He is the only permanent solution to our sin problem. His blood alone, shed on the cross, has the power to truly cleanse us. \n\nThe lyrics of Elisha A. Hoffman’s old gospel hymn, “Are You Washed in the Blood of the Lamb,” sum it up well:\n\nHave you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?\n\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?…\n\nAre your garments spotless?\n\nAre they white as snow?\n\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?\n\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is an invitation to stop our scrubbing and to bathe in the deluge of grace that flows from the cross. Our perfect Savior made a way for us to be cleansed—permanently. May we fully trust in His grace this hour, and the next, and all the ones to follow.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

To get there, we traveled to a remote location in central China on a bus that swayed along treacherous roads. I refused to look out the window for the majority of the drive because I was certain my gaze would draw us down to the canyon below. But soon enough a series of brown tapered roofs came into focus, hanging from the side of the mountain like an ancient rock climber with a strong grip. \n\nTo this day, Xuan Kong Monastery—also known as “the Hanging Monastery”—is one of the most interesting places of religious worship I’ve ever visited. Built 1,400 years ago, the walls and floors creaked with every step. My sense of awe may have actually been fear as I walked the narrow hallways, worried that at any moment the whole thing might crumble to the ground.\n\nNot too long ago, I read through a She Reads Truth study called See the Lord’s Salvation: A Lenten Study of Exodus, where I studied the God-given plans for another remarkable place of worship, one designed to honor God and built by His chosen people, the Israelites. (Go back to this study of Exodus to see the deep and intricate meaning of each detail in those plans.) But no matter how beautiful the tabernacle might have been, it was a human creation, a copy and a shadow of what was in heaven (Hebrews 8:5). Just like the Hanging Monastery in China, the tabernacle was fragile.\n\nOur churches and pastors and priests today are weak too. The walls creak. The leaders fail. Sometimes it feels like the sanctuaries do nothing more than remind us of our need. If that’s all they do, I’m okay with that. I need a better priest than the best on earth. I need a better temple.\n\nHere’s what’s amazing. “The true tabernacle set up by the Lord” (v.2) isn’t a destination with walls and nails. It is a communion we have with God in our hearts. For we are God’s temple and the Spirit of God lives in us (1 Corinthians 3:16–17). And Jesus, our High Priest and Good Shepherd, “is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises” (Hebrews 8:6). \n\nJesus is the kind of priest we need in a better sanctuary than we could ever build. He takes us with all our heartsickness, sin, and need, and gives us access to the Father. In that secret room, the one in our spirit, our Father waits, ready to meet with us. \n\nClaire Gibson is a writer whose work has been featured in publications including The Washington Post and Entrepreneur Magazine among many others.

It’s hard to imagine things will ever look much different than this, what’s right in front of us today. \n\nI doubt that even the most imaginative Israelites in Egypt could have fathomed their miraculous escape from slavery across the dry ocean floor (Exodus 13:17–14:31). The disciples huddled together in Jerusalem could not have foreseen the power of Pentecost, even in their wildest dreams. I mean, tongues of fire? Crazy! (Acts 2:3). And when we were slaves to our sin, we could not have comprehend being truly free (Romans 6:17; John 8:36). It seems our God is always moving us toward something better, something brighter—something more than we dare to ask, imagine, or hope for (Ephesians 3:20). \n\nThose who worshiped under the Old Testament covenant surely could not have grasped all that Jesus would usher in. That a day would dawn when sacrifices of animal blood were no longer required because Christ’s blood was sufficient to atone once and for all. That God’s presence wouldn’t rest between the angel’s wings on the ark of the covenant (Exodus 25:17–22), but would move freely in our hearts. That a time was coming when the law would not be written on slabs of stone, but instead on the hearts and minds of God’s beloved children (Jeremiah 31:33). That the curtain of the tabernacle would be torn in two, making a way for sinners to enter the presence of God (Matthew 27:51). \n\nYet, here we are, “speaking of a new covenant, [by which] he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away” (Hebrews 8:13). Today, we are the recipients of the avalanche of grace Moses could only dream of. We are free in a way even the Israelites who fled Egypt never knew. Under the new covenant, we have been saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. This is a gift from God by which all our wrongdoing is forgiven, our sins never to be remembered again (Ephesians 2:8–9; Hebrews 8:12).\n\nThe old is gone and the new, superior covenant of grace is better than our wildest hopes. But we are also broken people, still stuck in this broken world and so easily convinced that this is all there is. Yet God is moving us onward, toward something unthinkably good. All that we see is ready to vanish away because our God is making all things new (Revelation 21:1–5).\n\nMaybe you can’t quite picture it. Perhaps your heart doesn’t dare believe it, but that won’t stop the Lord from delivering it. The best is truly yet to come.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

It’s hard for me to remember that I have access to Him through the Holy Spirit at all times. It’s hard for me to remember that even when I don’t have the words to speak, He still listens.\n\nUnder the old covenant described in the first part of Hebrews 9, God’s people were unable to communicate with Him directly. While the priests could enter into the first room of the tabernacle to perform their ministry of sacrifices, God’s presence was contained inside the holy of holies of the tabernacle, a place only the high priest could enter but once a year, and only then to provide a sacrifice for himself and God’s people to cover the sins they had committed. \n\nThe author of Hebrews consistently uses Old Testament references and stories to tell his readers about the better hope they have in Christ. In referencing the old covenant, which they were undoubtedly familiar with, the author is reminding them of the freedom they now have in Christ—freedom to acknowledge God’s nearness and drink in His presence. Christ took the place of the high priest, entering into the most holy place, sacrificing Himself, and cleansing us with His blood (Hebrews 9:11–14). \n\n“[Christ] is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance, because a death has taken place for redemption from the transgressions committed under the first covenant” (v.15).\n\nChrist is the Great High Priest, and because of His sacrifice on the cross, God is ever-present with us. We don’t have to rely on a human high priest to go before God on our behalf; Christ does that for us. He looks at us and says that we are His children, His people—that nothing can separate us from His love (Romans 8:38).\n\nIt’s not always easy to remember that we have instant access to our Father. In situations where we don’t know what to say or pray or do, we feel alone. We forget He is already near to us—nearer than our very breath. But reminders of this new covenant ministry, a ministry we are now an active part of, keep us grounded in the knowledge that God is with us and for us.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 9:16-28, John 10:10, 2 Timothy 1:8-10\n\nWhat is the cost of forgiveness? \n\nI can forgive my husband for forgetting to feed the dogs and it costs me nothing. I can forgive someone for hurting my child, but it costs me a little more. I can even forgive the person who has hurt me most in this world, and it still costs me only the decision to forgive, even if I have to make the decision again and again. But what good does my forgiveness render? Certainly peace for me, and possibly some kind of peace for the one I forgive.\n\nOur forgiveness is vitally important, but there is a greater forgiveness that changes everything. Our forgiveness doesn’t actually yield eternal pardon for the offender, and that’s why it doesn’t cost us much. But in order to actually pay for one transgression of God’s law, someone has to literally die. That’s the deal. The wages of sin is actual death (Romans 6:23). A sacrifice must be made. But the sacrifice has to be totally without sin, so none of us can just valiantly die for our own sins. We need a sinless sacrifice. \n\nOur forgiveness is only possible because Christ is that sinless sacrifice. \n\nNow, because sin has been paid for, we have life and joy abundantly. By sacrificing Himself, He has removed our sins (Hebrews 9:26). When Christ comes again, He will come bringing the fulfillment of our salvation: everlasting life in glory.\n\nThis passage in Hebrews 9 seems to be about establishing the justice and legality of what Christ did. It is delivered in covenantal and transactional terms. Why? It is important to know that what Christ did, He did rightly. He didn’t cut corners, or sweep sin under the rug. He dealt with it fully, fairly, finally. Because of this, we can have great assurance and security in Christ. When Satan attempts to undermine our faith with doubt, we can lean on our righteousness of Christ. His payment for sin is fully sufficient. His grace is greater than all our sin, and nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews further his point with a comparison. The first covenant was also inaugurated with blood (v.18). But all the blood of bulls and goats could not fully satisfy the demands of justice. The blood of animals was sprinkled on the earthly tabernacle and its furnishings. But the blood of Christ, the only perfect and sufficient sacrifice, has purified even the heavenly things (v.23). His payment for our sin has paid our debt from the depths of earth to the heights of heaven.\n\nForgiveness requires the shedding of blood. And Christ’s blood has been shed for us. \n\nWhat then can man do to us? What can Satan say to topple such a salvation? Thanks be to God, we are secure in Christ. When Christ returns, we are told, He will come, not to pay a further debt (all our sins have been paid for!), but to bring salvation (v.28). Praise the Lord!\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her five little people.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 10:1-18, Psalm 40:1-17, 1 Peter 2:24\n\nTwice, my girlfriends have talked me into running a half marathon. And twice, my knees have revolted. Both times I hobbled across that finish line, I was so ready to be done. But can you imagine if I had decided to just keep running? I surely cannot. Yet, oftentimes in our spiritual lives we keep running a race that’s already been won. We keep thinking that if we just jog another lap, add on a few more miles, somehow we will be more qualified.\n\nThe thing is, Jesus ran the perfect race and won the final victory for us. With the sacrifice of His life He proclaimed, “It is finished” (John 19:28–30). So why don’t we accept the gift of grace? And if we have accepted it, why don’t we choose to live into it?\n\nGrace can be difficult to accept. While we all want forgiveness and unconditional love, the world has taught us that forgiveness is not easily won and love always comes with limits. It can be hard to live in the reality of God, in the truth of the gospel. We might picture our heavenly Father like an earthly one, disappointed or angry or withholding. We might think He judges us with a harsh eye. But God’s love is like nothing in this world, and until we open our hearts to His grace we will keep on needlessly trying to prove ourselves.\n\nUnlike the priests who had to daily return to their work, when Jesus offered His sufficient “sacrifice for sins forever, [He] sat down at the right hand of God” (Hebrews 10:12). He sat down. This symbolized completeness and finality. He didn’t pace around. He didn’t wring His hands. He didn’t find more busywork to do. He sat down at the right hand of His Father.\n\nChrist’s sacrifice is complete. It was also made “once for all time” (Hebrews 10:10), which means the gospel is always fresh. And because our hearts so easily forget this news that seems too good to be true, we need to be reminded again and again: every morning when we step out of bed, weary from a world we’ve barely woken to, every time we stumble and fall, and every time we believe the lie that we need to somehow earn the love of God. The repeated sacrifices of the old covenant can now be replaced with repeated proclamations of the gospel to ourselves and to our brothers and sisters.\n\nMaybe God is inviting you to sit down at His feet today—to just be with Him. To soak yourself in Christ’s finished work for you. You are saved, not by your own will or work, but by the perfect blood of Jesus. Rest easy in the presence of your Redeemer.\n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 10:19-39, Deuteronomy 32:35-36, Matthew 27:50-54\n\nThe universal law of cause and effect says that for every effect there is a cause, and likewise, for every cause there is an effect. Why am I giving you a refresher course in seventh-grade natural science? Because applying this law to our passage today is crucial in understanding hope in light of Christ’s faithfulness to us.\n\nHebrews 10:23 says, “Let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, since he who promised is faithful.” With “since” being the key word, we can determine that the law of cause and effect applied to this verse would go something like this:\n\nCause: He who promised is faithful.\n\nEffect: We hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering.\n\nWhat if we changed the placement of the word “since” to read, “Since we hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, he who promised is faithful”? It would entirely change our cause and effect, right?\n\nCause: We hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering.\n\nEffect: He who promised is faithful.\n\nIn the first set of cause-and-effect statements, we hold on to hope because Christ has been faithful to us. In the second, Christ is faithful to us because we hold on to hope.\n\nIf Christ’s faithfulness to me is contingent upon my hope, I’m in big trouble. My hope is not consistent. It varies from day to day, depending upon my circumstances, the weather, or how much coffee I’ve had. My hope can be high one hour and plummet the next.\n\nFortunately, Hebrews does not say we hold on to hope because we are a people who are so very good at hoping. It says we hold on to hope because Christ has been faithful. As the verses leading up to this one emphasize, “since we have boldness to enter the sanctuary through the blood of Jesus… and since we have a great high priest over the house of God… let us draw near… Let us hold on to the confession of our hope” (Hebrews 10:19,21–23).\n\nThe blood of Jesus, our Great High Priest, His faithfulness—this is why we hold on to hope.\n\nIt has taken me a long time to grasp this idea that living a life of faith is so much more about God’s faithfulness to me than it is my faithfulness to Him. To be honest, I still don’t think I completely get it. If I did, I would have far less anxiety, I would sin far less, and I would have much more hope. I need this reminder as much as the early Church did. When I feel hopeless, I need to repeat the cause again and again:\n\nSince He…\n\nSince He…\n\nSince He…\n\nHave hope today—not in your ability to hold onto hope, but in Christ’s faithfulness to you. It does not waver. It is the same day in and day out—yesterday, today, and forever. When we rely on His faithfulness alone, our posture toward life will be one of hope and not fear, of trust and not turning away. As the writer said, “We are not those who draw back and are destroyed, but those who have faith and obtain life” (v.39).\n\nAndrea Lucado is a freelance writer, Texas native, and the author of the memoir English Lessons: The Crooked Path of Growing Toward Faith.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 11:1-16, Psalm 33:6-7, John 1:9-13\n\nI recently read a novel by Min Jin Lee called Pachinko. Set in WWII, the story follows an immigrant Korean family that lives in Japan for four generations. The book chronicles their bold acts of faith, fortitude, and survival in the midst of oppression and racial prejudice. I won’t spoil the ending here, but rest assured the ending isn’t what makes the book worth reading. It’s the beginning, middle, and end, all woven together like a symphony. I’ve bought multiple copies, handing them out like candy.\n\nLikewise, the author of Hebrews recounts a family history. Our family history. Each tale is a marriage of belief and action—basically, faith and verbs. \n\nBy faith Abel offered.\n\nBy faith Noah built.\n\nBy faith Abraham obeyed and went.\n\nBy faith Sarah received.\n\nIt’s important to take a moment to really consider what those verbs cost our ancestors. Though Abel’s gift was accepted by God, he was still violently murdered by his brother. Though the ark provided rescue to Noah, he still suffered years of ridicule from his neighbors. Though God kept His promises to Abraham, Abraham still had to walk away from everything he knew and follow God into the desert. As the author of Hebrews says:\n\n“These all died in faith, without having received the promises, but they saw them from a distance, greeted them, and confessed that they were foreigners and temporary residents on earth. Now those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland” (Hebrews 11:13–14).\n\nI think the reason I like Pachinko so much is that it introduces a family seeking a homeland, experiencing rejection in the place where they live. As a Christian, I seek to embrace that same humbleness, embracing the truth that I am a temporary resident here on earth. This is not my final home. For that reason, I can sacrifice it all, including the comfort of home, if that is what God calls me to do. \n\nThese passages prompt me to ask myself: What are the verbs that God is asking me to act out in my life? Can I boldly trust that He will use those actions for His glory, no matter the cost? No matter the ending?\n\nOne thing is certain: God never spoils an ending. And He makes promises I can hold on to while I walk through the middle. I am chosen and never forsaken. God will go with me—He always arrives to the scene first, and acts as my rearguard. God promises He will complete the good work He started in me (Philippians 1:6). He promises that nothing will be wasted, but all things will be restored (Revelation 21:4–5). While I take these steps, any tears I shed will be like liquid words and God promises to read and store them all (Psalm 56:8).\n\nBut this is about more than just me and you. The author of Hebrews says that acts of faith make non-believers turn and watch. In other words, when we put our our faith into action, we create living proof to a dying world that God exists. Our “faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen” (Hebrews 11:1).\n\nThat is no small thing.\n\nClaire Gibson is a writer whose work has been featured in publications including The Washington Post and Entrepreneur Magazine among many others.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 11:17-40, Luke 13:34-35, James 1:2-4\n\nIt was my cab driver in Boston who lead me to the best cannolis I’ve ever had. “Skip the main bakery location downtown,” he suggested. “Walk a few blocks north and you’ll find the exact same thing without the wait.”\n\nIt was a shop owner in Austin who recommended I visit what I now refer to as “my most favorite bookstore of all time.” You could say I liked it, alright.\n\nIt was my friend in Chicago who knew precisely which building had the best views of the city skyline, and could tell me the history behind every structure and monument in sight.\n\nAnd if you visited my city, Nashville, I’d show you the live music venue with a back alley, so you can enter with the locals and avoid the throes of tourists. Oh, and I’d probably already have put in a request for your favorite song to make sure you sing karaoke before the night is over.\n\nRegardless of where you’re going, everyone knows the best way to find the best tips: ask the locals. Your server at dinner will have more insight than any guidebook you read on the plane, and the friend you’re staying with is guaranteed to keep you from going to the restaurants that didn’t live up to their online reviews.\n\nBut when it comes to faith, it’s even more important to have a guide. And when it comes to struggle or not knowing where to turn, the best thing to have on your side is someone who’s been through it before you. And that’s exactly what we’re given in Hebrews 11: examples of people who have lived by faith. “Faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen” (v.1), and yet, God is gracious enough to fill our eyes with hopeful images of our brothers and sisters who have successfully lived by the words He has promised.\n\nWe’re reminded of Abel’s sacrifice, Enoch’s protection, Noah’s motivation, Abraham’s obedience, Sarah’s conception, Isaac’s birth, Jacob’s worship, and Moses’s suffering—“all these were approved through their faith” (v. 39). But we’re given these examples not because we’re supposed to be more like each of these human men and women, but because they, too, were afraid. They, too, were unsure and doubtful and wondering if the things they were putting their trust in were actually real. They, too, hoped their faith was more than just wishful thinking.\n\nInside God’s Word, we get to learn from the locals, those who have gone before us and have seen the goodness and truth of our God in all things. But even better, we see time and time again that their go-to move isn’t to look to their own flesh for answers—it’s to ask their Creator. Their stories invite us to do the same, joining a long, tried-and-true legacy of faith.\n\nThe stories of God’s people point us to His face. May they continue to do so, and may our own stories be marked by faith as well. \n\nKaitlin Wernet is a twenty-something who lives to tell stories with a backbone of hope.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 12:1-13, Romans 12:18-21, 1 Timothy 2:5-6\n\nJesus invited His followers to take up their crosses and follow Him. From the outset of His ministry, He wanted us to know that the Christian life is not free from struggle. The writer of Hebrews encourages believers to “strengthen your tired hands and weakened knees” (Hebrews 12:12). Tired hands and weakened knees are not the result of a life on cruise control; they are the result of labor, opposition, and striving.\n\nSome of us may be all too familiar with this reality. Through trial and tribulation, we’ve become well aware that the way of Jesus isn’t always the smoothest path. Still, in times of plenty there is a tendency to brush over the hardships of faith and tough teachings of Scripture. In a comfortable season of life, we might be tempted to believe that our work as a “good Christian” means that God will bless everything we put our hands to. We can forget that walking in the way of Jesus is not without suffering and that, in Jesus, even our suffering has a redemptive purpose. \n\nListen to this encouragement from Hebrews 12:\n\n“Endure suffering as discipline: God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline? … Furthermore, we had human fathers discipline us, and we respected them. Shouldn’t we submit even more to the Father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time based on what seemed good to them, but he does it for our benefit, so that we can share his holiness. No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it” (vv.7-11).\n\nScripture is clear: God uses everything—struggle and hardship included—for the believer’s good (Romans 8:28). When we assume our way should be easy easy, we forget that Jesus promised the opposite (John 16:33). When we see all pain as a problem to avoid, we miss the opportunity to “rejoice in our afflictions, because we know that affliction produces endurance, endurance produces proven character, and proven character produces hope” (Romans 5:3–4). We miss the opportunity to become more like Christ.\n\nIt’s tempting to go through our places of struggle alone, not wanting God or anyone else to see us at a low point. But when we recognize dark days as an expected part of a life of faith, we can look to the One who has walked this road before. Jesus, our victor and champion, suffered betrayal, persecution, and excruciating death. A “man of sorrows” (Isaiah 53:3), He understands our pain. And He is with us through every hardship when we trust in Him. \n\nWhen your time of suffering comes, look to Jesus. \n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 12:14-29, Genesis 4:8-13, Isaiah 62:6-12\n\n“You don’t know what you have until it’s gone.” \n\nWe’ve all heard this old adage, or perhaps even experienced the painful truth of it at some point in our own lives. But it’s not really a case of not actually knowing what you had, is it? It’s more a matter of not appreciating that thing, that someone, that blessing—until it’s no longer yours. Maybe you never appreciated it because you never imagined a world in which you’d have to live without it.\n\nSuch is the case with Esau and the oh-so unwise forfeiting of his birthright to his twin brother for the immediate comfort of a home-cooked meal. Whether he truly “despised” his birthright or was merely indifferent to it, Esau did not place great enough importance on his blessing as Isaac’s firstborn son—the blessing that promised both divine protection and authority over other nations (Genesis 25:27–34; 27:29).\n\nWhile the Christians the writer of Hebrews was addressing weren’t merely fighting off hunger pangs, in the face of severe persecution they were tempted to forego their faith in Christ, exchanging the promises of the new covenant for the supposed comfort and familiarity of the old covenant. And so the writer of the book of Hebrews reminds the readers of what’s at stake, comparing the Israelites’ relationship to God at Mt. Sinai under the old covenant of the law (Exodus 19), with the blessings of salvation in Jesus Christ under the new covenant. \n\nThe comparison is a stark one. Their encounter with God at Mt. Sinai left the Israelites, and even Moses, shaken to the core (Hebrews 12:18–21). But that’s not the case for the Hebrew Christians, or for anyone whose faith is in Jesus Christ. \n\n“Instead, [we] have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God… to the assembly of the firstborn whose names have been written in heaven, to a Judge, who is God of all… and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant…” (vv.22–24).\n\nThe old covenant instilled a holy fear in the hearts of God’s people, putting a safe distance between them and God’s holiness. But the new covenant has torn away the veil separating us from God. Christ, our perfect Mediator and Judge (1 Timothy 2:5; 2 Timothy 4:8), put on skin and came down to endure the judgment of our sin. He eliminated the distance between God and His people, bringing us squarely into right and redeemed relationship with Him. “Our God is a consuming fire,” and His sacrificial love for us should should incite awe and reverence in our hearts, not indifference (Hebrews 12:29). \n\nTo know Christ is to be wrapped up in His grace—a hard-won grace that cost us nothing but did not come cheaply. It cost Jesus His life, the agony of bearing the weight of sin for all of humanity for all time and, for the first and only time in history, separation from the Father (Matthew 27:46). The writer of Hebrews is warning readers, cautioning us to not become hardened by persecution or indifferent to Jesus’s sacrifice, to the grace and salvation that can only be found in Him. “Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful” (Hebrews 12:28).\n\nKara Gause is an editor for She Reads Truth and happily resides in Nashville, Tennessee.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 13:1-25, Joshua 1:5-9, Matthew 25:34-40\n\nAfter thirteen chapters of establishing our great hope and exhorting us to godly living, Hebrews closes with a succinct reminder that all hope comes from Christ who is the “same yesterday, today, and forever” (Hebrews 13:8). The root of all godly living is the person of Christ. He is both our hope and our source of righteousness.\n\nAt the close of the this book, the author recommends a handful of what Matthew Henry calls “excellent duties”: show love and hospitality, care for the mistreated, honor marriage, eschew the love of money, and be satisfied with what you have. This final exhortation to contentment certainly loosens the reins and makes the other excellent duties easier. If one is content, the love of money can’t tempt and the shine of someone prettier or younger doesn’t lure.\n\nHave you ever known someone who is truly content? The author of Hebrews points us first and foremost to the example of Christ. But we are also encouraged to watch the fruit of other leaders and, if that fruit is good, imitate their faith. \n\nThe most contented person I know is Nell. You probably don’t know her; she’s not famous. I met her in college, but she wasn’t the first friend I made. She was quiet and I was so busy making sure everyone knew how much fun I was, I didn’t notice her.\n\nBut once I did notice her, I couldn’t stop. Nell doesn’t push, she doesn’t demand, even though she has stronger opinions than most. But she loves like a fountain, and she is content. These days she homeschools her six children in a small house by a river. She is teaching them the art of contentment by giving them what they need, but not what they demand. She shows them how to be content by being at peace herself. Instead of chasing the world, she has found that her rooms crowded with love hold the very best the world has to offer her.\n\nLight your corner of the world, friends—wherever it may be. And if these excellent duties of love and contentment seem impossible, do not fear; they are impossible. This is why the book of Hebrews was written: to point us always back to our need for Christ. He is our helper, “who promises to never leave us or forsake us” (v.5). \n\nLift your eyes to the eternal glory of Christ, for He is our hope in things both large and small. Any excellence and contentment that flows out of our lives will come from Him. Because of His sanctifying blood, we are made new creatures—creatures capable of hospitality and contentment. Jesus is our hope. He is our strength. And He is the same, yesterday, today, and forever.\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her five little people.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nScripture Reading: James 1:1-18, Jeremiah 31:7-14, Matthew 4:1-11, 1 Peter 1:6-7\n\nHave you ever noticed how in times of pain or trial, we comfort our friends, loved ones, and even ourselves, with words like:\n\n“You’re going to make it through this.”\n\n“Tomorrow will be better.”\n\n“What can I do to ease your pain?”\n\nOur endgame is an end to suffering. We pray for the bad times to go away. We beg that they would never come at all. A whole industry of mylar balloons and teddy bears exists bearing the sentiment, “Get Well Soon!” We ask the Lord to remove our thorns, to help us endure our hardships, and to bring us through suffering as unscathed as possible. \n\nBut Jesus’ brother James, the author of this short letter, has an entirely different take on trials.\n\n“Consider it a great joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you experience various trials.”\n\n– James 1:2\n\nDon’t get over them. Don’t rush through them or past them. Rejoice in them.\n\nJames tells us not to be so hasty to escape the faith-testing valleys because those valleys contain the fertile soil needed to produce steadfastness. And steadfastness—being immovable, unable to be shaken, deeply rooted—is perhaps the true “wellness” we should be seeking. \n\nAs Christians, we eagerly say we want to be like Christ. But many of us are really only asking for the good stuff. “Lord, make us loving and patient and joyful!” we sing in chorus and with enthusiasm. \n\nJesus was indeed all of those things, but He was also described by the prophet Isaiah as “a man of suffering who knew what sickness was” (Isaiah 53:3). Christ Himself learned obedience through His suffering (Hebrews 5:8). And so it is for us. It is from those dark yet fertile valleys that steadfastness begins to spring forth—first sprouting from faith, then budding into love, and flowering into patience and joy.\n\nToday, or tomorrow, or whenever you find yourself in a place of trial—do not minimize it or rush through it. Instead, give thanks to the Lord. Pray for endurance and steadfastness from the One who has already endured and proven Himself steadfast. \n\nAs backwards as it may feel, this difficult trial or painful suffering is a time to thank the Lord. This is the time to rejoice.\n\nWe do not rejoice because bad things happen, or because this poor, fallen world is full of death, injustice, and sorrow. No. We rejoice because the sovereign Lord calls us His own. He loves us enough to descend with us into the dark yet mysteriously fertile valleys, to produce in us a steadfastness which cannot be shaken.\n\nThanks be to God.\n\n“Blessed is the one who endures trials, because when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.”\n\n– James 1:12\n\n \n\n",

Perhaps it’s my nervousness that I’ve directed my stylist the wrong way, or that the color we picked won’t work at all with my skin tone. But beyond the anxiety that comes from letting someone else take control for a few hours, there’s a measured amount of discomfort that comes from looking at myself in the mirror for that long. \n\nEvery blemish seems to glow under the lights of my local salon. My eyebrows seem significantly more unruly than I thought they had become, and the makeup I had so carefully applied hours ago has mostly melted away, revealing the oh-so-telling dark circles under my very tired eyes. \n\nAnd yet when I leave, somehow I always feel so much better. I’ve been transformed—or at least my hair has. \n\nIt is transformation and the confidence that comes with it that James is urging us to seek through the reading of the Word. Of course, it’s much less superficial and quite a bit harder than sitting in a salon chair. James tells us that when we hear the Word of God and don’t act, then we are just like a man sitting in front of a mirror, seeing all his blemishes and yet walking away without caring, without doing anything. \n\nIf looking in the mirror is hard, looking deep into the Word of God is harder— especially when reading James’s words. They reflect back to me my own anger, my quickness to speak, my moral failures, my pride. \n\nBut being transformed by the Word means becoming a doer, not just a hearer. It means inviting the Holy Spirit to carve out those ugly places and fill them with the righteousness that Jesus gives, so that I might live out what James calls a “pure and undefiled religion” (1:27). The Word becomes more than a book to me; it is a means of grace, a tool of the Spirit’s sanctifying work in my heart. \n\nJesus said it this way: \n\n“Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.  And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.  And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.  And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”\n\n– Matthew 7:24-27\n\nJesus is the Word made flesh, sent to dwell among us. We are called to look daily not into a mirror, but into the Word—into the very face of Jesus. \n\nThe gospel-filled life Christ calls us to is not one full of quick and angry words, self-serving pride, or self-sufficiency, but of sacrificial love and humility. We are called to let the Word do its work inside us—to read it daily with fresh eyes as it, by the Holy Spirit, reads our hearts and transforms us, making us more and more like Jesus.\n\nMelanie Rainer is the director of content for JellyTelly, where she writes and edits family spiritual formation resources.

It caught me off guard—my sin of favoritism.\n\nHours before, I’d watched a video on discrimination alongside my ministry team. The clip highlighted how easily we can fall into judging and favoring others. To further illustrate the point, we were divided into two different groups based on one aspect of our lives, something we had no control over: our eye color. People with blue eyes were to be treated differently than those with brown eyes.  \n\nSoon comments and accusations were flying back and forth. The responses of those discriminated against felt strangely satisfying to me. One woman in particular spoke with such disdain; her condescending attitude only proved her lack of awareness of those who live in the margins every day. I confess I was happy to have her sit in the back of the room as a member of the “discriminated” group, so she could experience a lack of equity. \n\nThe next day, our group entered into a time of prayer, confession, and lament. That’s when God opened my eyes in a new way to Galatians chapter five, where Paul lists the works of the flesh: enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy. The very things our team had sought to address and combat head-on were now being revealed in my own heart. I had judged that woman, and in thinking less of her, I showed partiality toward others who appeared more self-aware and further along in their faith journey. \n\n“My brothers and sisters, do not show favoritism as you hold on to the faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ… haven’t you made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?”\n\n– James 2:1,4\n\nThis sin—my sin of judging some and favoring others—is cautioned against throughout Scripture. In His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus couldn’t be more clear when He says, “Do not judge, so that you won’t be judged. For you will be judged by the same standard with which you judge others, and you will be measured by the same measure you use” (Matthew 7:1-2).\n\nThe Lord is the only one worthy of being the Judge. He’s the only one capable of judging fairly. “For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7). It’s not our job to do the work of the Holy Spirit in convicting others of their sin, but we are called to respond to the Spirit’s conviction in our own hearts.\n\nWhen we try to take God’s place as judge and jury, perhaps it’s because we’ve lost sight of just how great a debt Jesus died to pay on our behalf. Now, God’s “mercy triumphs over judgment” (James 2:13); His justice has been satisfied once and for all who love Jesus (Romans 3:25-26). \n\nWe’re all on a journey, learning to honor the Lord through loving one another well. Daily, as we walk in step with the Spirit, may we speak the gospel into our waking moments. As sin is exposed, let us draw near to our Savior. Mercy triumphed over judgment when Christ died for us, sinners, and rescued us from deserved condemnation. And mercy triumphs still, as a holy God looks at us and sees the spotless image of His Son.\n\nVivian Mabuni is a speaker and author, and a sushi, white Christmas lights, post-its, and coffee-with-friends lover.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: James 2:14-26, Deuteronomy 6:4-5, Romans 3:23-26, Ephesians 2:8-10\n\nFor it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n\nI love that Christian freedom is based on this principle: free, radical grace exists for the undeserving through Jesus. There’s nothing we can do to receive it; there’s nothing we can do to reverse it. Incredible, wonderful, scandalous grace.\n\nThat’s why reading James’ words can feel confusing. Is he contradicting grace, saying we’re justified by our works—that without those good works, our faith is as good as dead?\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time grappling with these passages, asking God to open my eyes to what He was saying through these two disciples. On the surface, it seems like they are contradicting one another. Then He reminded me of a breakfast I shared with a friend recently. \n\nI’ve known this friend since I was ten years old. She’s gorgeous, extremely athletic, and was always popular in school. Over the twenty years we’ve known each other, we’ve stayed loosely in touch. Over coffee and eggs, she shared the circumstances of her life—mostly that it hadn’t turned out like she’d planned. \n\nAs we talked, I felt God pressing me to speak. It felt strange, so I hesitated, afraid of sounding cheesy or trite. I knew things between us could get awkward. But then I didn’t really feel like I had a choice. So I said it: \n\n“I don’t know why, but I really feel like God wants me to tell you that He loves you.” \n\nI cringed after saying it, wondering if I’d gone too far. But in that moment, something softened. Tears fell down her cheeks. Rather than turning awkward, the entire moment felt sacred. \n\nHebrews chapter 11 recounts the spiritual giants whose faith in God was counted as righteousness. But that faith wasn’t void of action. A quick perusal of the list and you’ll see it over and over again: verbs.\n\nBy faith Abel offered.\n\nBy faith Noah built.\n\nBy faith Abraham obeyed.\n\nOur God is a God of action. So if you have faith in Him, get ready to move. \n\nThis is the beauty of Christianity: our faith in Jesus saves us, and it also frees us from striving to be enough, trying to earn approval, stature, or recognition through what we do. I can do good works without having to worry about measuring the outcome. Faith in Jesus’ final, finished work gives me the security to do good without worrying that I’m doing enough.\n\nThis is where it gets crazy. My friend called me a few weeks later to tell me something had radically changed in her heart. From that moment we shared at the breakfast table, she’d felt God in hot pursuit of her. Since then, she’s been spending every morning in His Word, falling in love with Him again. \n\nIs it possible God can use us like that? Is it possible that I’d just experienced a good work He’d prepared for me in advance, one He’d planned for me to do all along? After all, the work isn’t really mine. I’m just His workmanship (Ephesians 2:10). I’m an instrument in His hands, playing an essential part in His eternal symphony. \n\nWhat a gift. \n\nTo be saved by grace.\n\nTo be invited into God’s work.\n\nTo see that, in the end, it’s all His.\n\n \n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: James 3:1-12, Genesis 1:26-27, Psalm 12, Matthew 12:36-37\n\nThe idea of “controlling the tongue” is not just religious-speak to me. It is not just a heading in my Bible or a topic that generates good, honest conversation at a Bible study. It is one of the most sincere prayers of my heart and one of the darkest manifestations of my sin.\n\nEspecially since becoming a mother, I’ve realized my words have the power to give life and hope or to steal them away. I’ll never forget the look in my young daughter’s eyes the first time I tossed sharp, careless words at her like a grenade and saw her wince at the explosion. I surrendered my tongue and its words to the Lord that day, and I’ve surrendered them countless times since.\n\nIn chapter 3, James describes the tongue as the epitome of hypocrisy. “With the tongue we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in God’s likeness” (James 3:9). And here’s the kicker: We are all guilty of this—every one of us, in every phase of life.\n\nJames does not give us a tidy “how-to” at the end of this passage, no foolproof answer for ending this struggle which takes place in each of us. Instead, he provides one analogy after the other, illustrating the way our words can bring life and direction, or death and destruction.\n\n“So too, though the tongue is a small part of the body, it boasts great things. Consider how a small fire sets ablaze a large forest” (v. 5).\n\nOur words have more power than we usually care to acknowledge. If we knew—really knew—the weight our words carry in each person who receives them, how would that change what we say? Would the flames of hypocrisy overcome us if we could see the fires we spark?\n\nThis forthright passage from James should bring us to our knees. Our struggle to control our tongues and rein in our thoughts should cause us to plead to the Father for wisdom in how to honor Him and build up others with our words. This is just what James encourages us to do in the first chapter of his letter: \n\n“Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God—who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly—and it will be given to him” (James 1:5).\n\nPraise God that He hears us! \n\nJust as grace pours into the darkest parts of our hearts, igniting the hope of the gospel, so does His grace pour over the fires we start with our words. The hope of Jesus and the forgiveness of the Father extend to this place, too. As a woman who’s flung more sparks than I care to admit, I am so incredibly thankful.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: James 3:13-18, Proverbs 11:18, Romans 12:9-21, Galatians 5:22-23, Hebrews 12:11\n\nYou could fill an entire library with all the bad dating advice heard around the world. As early as elementary school, girls are told to change their style or personality to woo a crush. In high school, magazines tell girls to pretend to laugh at his jokes or play hard to get. Even in our twenties, thirties, and beyond, the barrage of bad dating advice from media, friends, and professionals is inescapable. Advice rooted in jealousy, insecurity, and selfishness has engulfed our culture.\n\nWe’ve all sought advice from the world, whether on dating or some other aspect of life. We all face experiences that challenge and confuse us—they’re often the moments that grow us the most. As James says from the very beginning of his book, the trials of life produce maturity (1:2-4). But where we choose to turn with our questions when we’ve lost our way can dramatically change the course of our journey.\n\nAs a counselor, people often turn to me for advice and wisdom while in the throes of crisis. And the truth is, I don’t have all the answers or the perfect advice for every person. Thankfully, my work is more about supporting people along their journey, rather than telling them which steps to take. The desire for clarity isn’t wrong, but there is only one all-knowing and perfect Counselor—and it sure isn’t me.  \n\nWe need to be careful whom we trust to speak into our lives. Hear me on this: it is immeasurably valuable to open your life up to guidance from your trusted church community. But we need to remember that all of us are broken vessels, imperfectly reflecting the image of God. The Lord speaks through people (Matthew 10:20), but we must weigh the words of others with the help of the Holy Spirit to discern what God Himself is saying.\n\nJames does not take the matter of bad advice lightly, going as far as to call it demonic (James 3:15). Why is it such a big deal? Because bad advice can wound people and even destroy lives. There is a sharp distinction between wisdom from above, and wisdom from below. Knowing how serious the consequences can be, we need to be careful with both the counsel we take and the counsel we give. \n\nThankfully, James describes what godly “wisdom from above” looks like. Wisdom from God is “pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering without pretense” (3:17). \n\nInterestingly, those descriptions don’t sound anything like the most “influential” voices in our culture. But is there anyone that does come to mind when you read James’s description of wisdom? Those are the people we ought to turn to for advice, the people we should hope to grow more like over time. \n\nOf course, the life of Christ is the ultimate example of godly wisdom in action. If anyone knows what it is like to face trials, it’s Jesus before the cross. And ultimately who does He seek for comfort and wisdom but His Father? (Luke 22:39-43). This is God’s best for us too.\n\nIn times of crisis and pain, when we’re looking for direction, may our hearts learn to hear the instruction of the Holy Spirit. May we seek first the wisdom of our Heavenly Father. Even now, He longs to be gracious to us, to generously give us wisdom when we ask Him for it (Isaiah 30:18; James 1:5). We’ll know it’s from Him because true wisdom from above carries with it the sweet aroma of gentleness and peace.\n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

I didn’t really have a choice. I woke up before the sun, an hour from home, stared at the ceiling, and writhed in the sheets, trying to get out of my own skin. I didn’t want to be me anymore. “Me” had screwed everything up. I wanted to be someone else, or find a way to go back in time and undo all the wrong I had done.\n\nI wanted to start over.\n\nIf I could just go back to the beginning of the year. Or, no, the beginning of last year. Really, if I could go back to before college, that would be best. Or, possibly back to childhood. I was happy then, right? Maybe back then I was okay. I turned to punch my pillow. I know I can never go back far enough. I am who I am. Because of sin, there wasn’t a specific moment in time when things started to wrong. And that is humbling.\n\nI eventually got out of bed and got in my car to drive home. There was an accident on the highway—the kind that makes you put your car in park. I screamed and slammed the steering wheel and didn’t care who saw me in the next lane. The car was pointed home, but I didn’t know where I was going. I just needed to be alone with God and scream at Him and apologize to Him and beg for His forgiveness. Every twenty minutes or so, my mom called to check in on me. She knew I was in a dark night of the soul. “Keep screaming,” she said. “All God requires of us is to acknowledge we have done wrong and turn around.”\n\nThose words had never touched my soul so deeply. \n\nThis is the truth: The world seduces us with its material goods, its experiences, its flushes of beauty and its moments of lust. When we’re proud, we walk along that destructive path, trying to feign confidence. We fill our hands with the world’s pleasures, but like sand, it falls through our fingers. We dig and dig, but in the end, we’re left dirty and empty-handed. All the castles we build are eventually swept away.\n\nHumility is admitting the truth: I have nothing. That’s what I screamed to God in the car. That’s what James wants us to shout to the Lord, too. And thankfully, beautifully, God stands arms open wide, ready for us to turn to Him. He holds our hand when we let go of everything else.\n\nDo you know what’s amazing about this kind of humility? Letting go of the world actually gives us the power—God’s power—and strength to live in this world. It’s a paradox. When we put our entire identity in God, we are no longer slaves to the world’s trends or its approval. We can stand up for justice, at the risk of looking foolish. We can endure ridicule, rather than fight for our reputation. When we have humbled ourselves before God, we don’t need the world’s applause, because our treasure is in heaven.\n\nThank God for humility. And thank God that when we finally, finally, fall to our knees, screaming and ugly-crying before Him, He comes to lift us up.\n\nPunch a pillow today, friend. Tell God the truth about who you are. He already knows. Still He waits for you. He longs to hold you, even though you have nothing but yourself to give.\n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

(Incidentally, if you want a good laugh, go back to another season in life and read about what was important to you then.) Sometimes I mentioned an upcoming event or trip or a boy or some kind of debacle that I’d found myself in. But I always had some kind of a plan in motion.\n\nThe trend started early. I once found a to-do list from when I was about eight years old that included “play outside for 1.5 hours.” Because childhood is way more fun when you plan it.\n\nTo this day, my tendency to plan is in full effect. Each and every day starts off with a to-do list of what I want to accomplish. I even add the tasks I’ve already finished, just for the satisfaction of checking them off ‘the list.’ Anyone else?\n\nMy junior year of college, some of my dearest and I planned a retreat to the suburbs of Chicago. As we pulled onto the freeway, I was in the passenger seat in charge of navigation, giving me the much-appreciated perception of control. So you can imagine my surprise when I looked up from my map to see the car in front of us at a full stop—while we cruised along in pace with the rest of the highway. \n\nWhat happened next felt so slow that I can remember every moment, but it was, in reality, mere seconds. Everything became eerily silent. My last thought before impact was, You’re about to be in a car accident. \n\nCome now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will travel to such and such a city and spend a year there and do business and make a profit.” Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring—what your life will be! For you are like vapor that appears for a little while, then vanishes.\n\n– James 4:13-14\n\n Nothing prepares you for a crash. For the smell of exhaust. The sound of bending metal and shattering glass. The taste of airbag dust. The shock.\n\nAs things settled, I leaned my shoulder into the car door and stepped out of the wreckage into the stopped, shocked traffic, the Chicago skyline rising up around me. I brushed the airbag dust off of my shirt and cheeks and took a few shaky steps. For months, I would wrestle with the crash in my dreams as I waded through the feeling of helplessness.\n\nIt’s inevitable. We get phone calls or texts or emails that stop us dead in our tracks. The devastating news comes—on-screen, in a letter, or across someone else’s lips. Or maybe, like me, you’ve witnessed or experienced something horrific, something tragic or traumatic. Suddenly, your plans get pushed aside and those to-do lists get burned. You’re left raw and broken, trying to catch your breath.\n\nThat’s the moment when you remember the truth: you’re not the one upholding anything. You remember not to “boast about tomorrow, for you don’t know what a day might bring” (Proverbs 27:1). Christ alone holds all things together (Colossians 1:17).\n\nTomorrow could bring beauty; it could bring heartache. But as I’ve been reminded, even in my darkest moments, Christ holds me fast. Each moment is laced with His grace.\n\nMelissa Zaldivar is a social in the world of academics and an academic in the world of socials.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY She Reads Truth\n\nScripture Reading: James 5:1-6, Matthew 5:38-42, Hebrews 10:35-39, Revelation 20:11-15\n\nMy husband and I were on our way to a dinner party, when we cut through a neighborhood on the nice side of town. As we drove the luxurious streets, we stared out our windows at the soaring homes with custom architecture and perfectly manicured lawns. Each house looked like the perfect place to live, its own little heaven on earth. We drove in silence, until my husband turned to me and laughingly apologized, “I’m sorry I’m a pastor.”\n\nThis is a running joke between us, though I can’t help but detect a hint of truth in his voice. We have every single thing we need, and more, but that doesn’t stop comparison from knocking on our door. On more days than I care to admit, I peek over the fence into my neighbor’s greener pasture, and I yearn for it. \n\nDeep down, my husband and I both know that “more” will never scratch the itch of envy. More money, more house, more things will not relieve the pain—and the lie—of comparison. It’s a bottomless pit of need, with endless demands which are never satisfied. We know this, but we also need reminding. \n\nThis is the gift of James 5, which reminds us what is true about all our pretty possessions. Preached with the same fire-bellied conviction as the Old Testament prophets, James has harsh words for wealthy people who misuse their riches. According to New Testament scholar Douglas Moo, James is not targeting all wealthy people, but those who put their wealth to unrighteous ends. Or, those who are simply stingy with it. For those believers, James reserves his harshest judgments.\n\nHowever, James has a more universal message too. Whether we have wealth or we don’t, whether we misuse our money or we don’t, our possessions amount to very little. Drawing on earlier biblical imagery of moth and rust (Matthew 6:19), James reminds us that even our finest earthly possessions will one day be gone. Their Kingdom weight is slight. Their investment yields even less. Money and possessions cannot, and will not, give us what we want. \n\nSo, how do we escape the wretched emptiness this passage describes? \n\nFirst, feed on God, not things. Our pursuit of possessions is a lot like trying to satisfy deep hunger by eating a single lettuce leaf. It will not fill us. Our appetites can only be satisfied by the “bread of life,” Jesus Christ, who promises, “No one who comes to me will ever be hungry, and no one who believes in me will ever be thirsty again” (John 6:35).\n\nSecond, be generous. Too often, we resolve not to love our possessions too much, a mindset that is well-intentioned but without accountability or discernibility. The world will only know we hold our possessions loosely if we actually hold them loosely. This is why Jesus exhorts us to radical acts of generosity (Matthew 5:40-42). Jesus commands this, not simply because it’s a “nice thing to do,” but because it sets our hearts—and, therefore, our feet—on a different path, away from the destruction James describes. \n\nThese are truths we must speak over ourselves again and again. The sparkle and shine of worldly goods are a powerful illusion, but the more we return to these biblical truths, the more they will start to sink in. \n\nNow, whenever my husband apologizes for what we cannot afford, I turn to him and smile to say, “You know what, they don’t have anything we don’t already have in Christ.” \n\n \n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: James 5:7-20, Joel 2:23, Matthew 5:33-37, Hebrews 11:32-40, 1 Peter 4:7-11\n\nWhen I see the word “patience” listed in Galatians 5, along with the other fruit of the Spirit, I groan. I’m reading happily along with love, joy, and peace, and then… patience. Ugh.\n\nI know I’m not patient. Watch me try to fold a fitted sheet. But patience, as talked about in the Bible, is much more than remaining calm in the midst of fitted-sheet frustration.\n\nTake the new believers in the book of James as an example. These people were Jews recently converted to Christianity. Because of their new beliefs, they were rejected by their own people. They were persecuted by everyone around them, and James tells them to do what? \n\n“You also must be patient.”\n\n– James 5:8\n\nThe Greek word often used for patience in Scripture is makrothumeo, which means… well, it means words that make me uncomfortable, such as:\n\nLongsuffering\n\nSlowness in avenging wrongs\n\nSteadfastness\n\nForbearance.\n\nPatience is much deeper than something you practice when someone is hogging the bathroom. Patience—the longsuffering kind of patience—is something that arises when real trial strikes.\n\nA few months ago, my own longsuffering was tested. I wish I could tell you I turned to God, fully trusting Him during this dark time, but no. Instead, I shook my fist, and I shook it hard. I was angry at God, and I tried desperately to escape the anxiety and darkness by my own means.\n\nYou could say I was the opposite of longsuffering. I was short-suffering, tiny-suffering, microscopic-suffering. I realized in those few months that my pain threshold is nearly nonexistent and, even still, I know most of you reading this have weathered much worse. My life was not bearing the fruit of patience because somewhere deep down inside of me I didn’t trust my God. And somewhere even deeper inside of me, I had lost hope and convinced myself I was alone.\n\nBut there’s an amazing thing about the word longsuffering in the New Testament: it is almost always an instruction given in the context of hope.\n\nRomans 8 says, “For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together with labor pains until now. . . We ourselves who have the Spirit as the firstfruits—we also groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies” (vv. 22-23).\n\nAnd in Galatians 6:9, we’re told, “So we must not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don’t give up.”\n\nWe groan. But we don’t give up. Better still, we do not wait without hope! \n\nWe do not wait in vain. We wait for our God—the God who has promised and secured our full redemption through Jesus Christ.\n\nMay we do the same for each other in the face of our trials. Let’s practice longsuffering together. Let’s look at our lives with an eye to that glorious day in the future when suffering is but a long, forgotten memory of this earth.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nWhat do you do when God’s plans for your life unfold differently than you expected? \n\nThis question arises again and again throughout the Bible. Abraham is promised descendants, but then his wife is barren. Joseph is promised leadership, but then he is thrown into a pit. The disciples are promised a Messiah, but then He is arrested and killed.\n\nOver and over throughout the Bible, God’s people live in a tension between the promises of God and the reality of their present circumstances, and this tension is the context of Revelation.\n\nPrior to the writing of this book, the world had experienced an unprecedented outpouring of the Spirit of God. People saw miraculous signs and wonders. The gospel spread like wildfire. Thousands came to Christ. Lives were changed. It all must have felt fast and furious and wonderful.\n\nAnd then, as if someone had slowly turned off the faucet of God’s power, the revolution seemed to stall. In its place, persecution. Roman authorities increasingly pressured Christians to worship Caesar or face severe punishment. The hostility toward Christians intensified, and this left them wondering: \n\nWhere was God?  What happened to His promises? Is Jesus still coming back?  What do we do now?\n\nSooner or later, we all find ourselves in this place of uncertainty. We wonder if we misheard God or if we did something wrong to provoke Him—or if He is even there at all. And in this place of tension, it’s tempting for doubt to become our compass, instead of faith.\n\nThis is where the book of Revelation begins. The people of God are struggling, and the mission feels unclear. As a result, some Christians are compromising the truth of God’s Word and caving into the culture. Some are disobedient, while others are simply lukewarm. So God reiterates His promises with a “revelation” to John that is glorious and startling and surreal.\n\nIt’s easy to get lost in the imagery of this book, but the first chapter of Revelation holds the key. All we really need to know of “the First and the Last” (v.17) is that Jesus Himself is the definitive “revelation” for the world. Everything we need to know about God, we know through Christ. Everything we need to know about our past, we know through Christ. Everything we need to know about our future, we know through Christ. \n\nNot an inch of God’s Word or God’s plan is out of character with the Son of God, and this is the lens through which we should read everything contained in Revelation. It is tempting to be dogmatic about the meaning of these abstract images, but the point of this book is simple: to direct our trust toward the “Living One” who was dead and is now “alive forever and ever” (v.18).\n\nThis truth about Jesus—about His life, His death, and His resurrection—does not change with our circumstances or with our doubts. It holds. Whatever may come, Jesus is our unstoppable hope, from first to last. That is the message of Revelation, and the message for our lives.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Sharon Hodde Miller\n\n“Things are getting worse and worse.”\n\nWhen we look at the news, the culture, the entertainment, and even the Church today, it’s easy to feel as if everything is slowly getting worse. It’s tempting to believe that the world is gradually unraveling, and that we are moving further away from truth, instead of toward it.\n\nWhenever we feel this cynicism begin to creep in, the temptation is to idealize the generations that have gone before us. We think, Our parents’ generation, our grandparents’ generation, the earliest Christians—they had it all together. Things weren’t as bad back then!\n\nI struggle with this mentality often. There are days when I feel jaded about Christians and about the Church. I log onto social media and see division and in-fighting, or I read about a pastor failing his congregation and his family. I see name-calling and judgment and the drawing of big, deep lines, and my heart wants to harden toward it all.\n\nOn those days when we are tempted to dismiss the world with a flick of the wrist, when we find ourselves looking down on other Christians who “aren’t doing it right,” and when we despair that the Church’s reputation is hopelessly smeared, Revelation 2–3 has a word for us.\n\nIn these chapters, written just a generation after Jesus’s resurrection, many churches are distracted and lost. Although they are working hard and striving to be faithful, God also levels the following charges against them: \n\nThey had forsaken their first love (2:4).\n\nThey participated in pagan rituals (2:14).\n\nThey were sexually immoral (2:14).\n\nThey embraced false teaching (2:15, 20).\n\nThey had a reputation of being alive, but they were dead (3:1).\n\nThey were lukewarm, neither hot nor cold (3:16).\n\nAll this, only sixty years after Jesus walked the earth.\n\nWhat this tells us is that the world is not simply getting worse, and neither is the Church. Following Jesus has always been hard. Faithfulness to God has always come unnaturally. Ever since sin entered the world, human nature has found it difficult to obey. \n\nAnd that is exactly why we need a Savior. \n\nThe good news of Jesus Christ begins with the bad news that we are broken. We have always been distracted. We have always resisted the truth. It was true two thousand years ago, and it is just as true today. Therefore, these letters to the seven churches in Asia minor are important for us as well. “Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches” (Revelation 2:29).\n\nBut our brokenness has never stopped God. Our division, our fighting, our apathy, our immorality, even our bad theology—none of it has ever stopped God. So when we read Revelation 2–3, we can do three things. First, we can remember that humanity is not getting worse, and neither is the Church—the temptation to turn away from God and His ways has always been there. Second, we can welcome this list of rebukes as an opportunity to identify our own areas of need. \n\nAnd finally, we can hope. In Revelation 3:19, God says, “Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline” (NIV). When we see darkness in the world—no matter how great—we don’t have to despair, and our hearts don’t have to grow hard. Instead, we can consider the possibility that God is allowing us to see these things, so that He can redeem them. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nOne of my sons’ favorite bedtime stories is The Sword in the Stone. As a child, I grew up watching the animated version of this tale, in which a lanky, awkward boy named Arthur unwittingly prepares to become king. Set in twelfth century England, the legend describes a country in turmoil, where the king has died without an heir to take his place. In order to resolve this dilemma, a wizard named Merlin places a sword in an anvil with the following words inscribed upon it: “Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise King born of all England.”\n\nAs the story goes, plenty of strong men and mighty warriors attempt to remove the sword, but every one of them fails. That is, until Arthur. This young, scrawny, misfit approaches the sword and is able to pull it from the anvil, finally restoring order to the kingdom.\n\nThe legend of Arthur is only a myth, but it echoes a story that is not. In chapters 4 and 5 of Revelation, we encounter a similar scene, but in place of a sword we have a scroll (5:1). We don’t know what exactly is inside the scroll, but New Testament scholar N.T. Wright speculates: “We rightly guess… that it contains God’s secret plan to undo and overthrow the world-destroying projects that have already gained so much ground, and to plant and nurture instead the world-rescuing project which will get creation itself back on track in the right direction.”\n\nMuch like the sword in the stone, what is significant about the scroll is not simply what is inside of it, but Who is able to unseal it. Like the sword, there is only one who is worthy to unleash its power. That chosen one, we soon discover, is Jesus—the “Lamb,” the “Root of David,” the “Lion from the tribe of Judah” (5:6,5). Christ alone can initiate God’s plan to rescue and redeem the world. \n\nThat is how the two stories are similar. This is how they differ:\n\nIn The Sword and the Stone, Arthur does nothing to earn the title of king. Although legend holds that he was secretly a royal heir, Arthur’s worthiness (much like Abraham, Moses, and David) comes solely from the fact that he is chosen for the task. He does not earn it, and he does not deserve it.\n\nChrist, on the other hand, is a different kind of hero. He is not simply plucked from thin air. Instead, the Lamb is worthy for two important reasons. First, He is worthy to redeem the brokenness of the world because He is the only one who did not contribute to it. And second, He is worthy to rescue humanity because He purchased us by His blood (5:9). \n\nUnlike most of our favorite heroes, Jesus was not chosen in spite of Himself. Even our greatest heroes, our noblest heroes, our most perfect heroes are still only a shadow of the Hero we have in Christ. By virtue of His identity and by the power of His blood, He alone is able to open the scroll and initiate God’s plan to redeem the world.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nEvery year, wildfires break out on America’s west coast, decimating forests and grasslands, threatening homes, and turning the sunset skies into a haze of pink. The power of fire is terrifying and awesome, and we’ve all seen the danger it poses to homes and lives in its path. While fire holds a mighty power for destruction, the land on the west coast actually needs a certain amount of these fires; they clean forest floors, pare down the plants that consume the water, kill plant diseases, and release seeds from trees that require fire to start the next generation. Don’t let the power and terror of fire mask the severe good that it serves.\n\nThe coming of God’s judgment is a terror to the wicked, but it is a comfort to His children. God’s judgment is not blind punishment. It is the setting right of all things. God comes to judge sin and avenge injustice. And in Scripture we see that He holds back judgment for a time so that many more might come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). To those who trust in Him, His judgment is a refining fire that strips away sin and removes the sting of death. God’s judgment sets the world right again.\n\nHe comes to undo the curse and make all things new. God’s judgment carries this beautiful promise: “They will no longer hunger; they will no longer thirst; the sun will no longer strike them, nor will any scorching heat” (Revelation 7:16). What a joyful declaration! Our king will take away the curse of sin and death and bring us to a place of satiety and comfort. I love that the God of the universe cares whether or not I’m hungry or too hot. Our personal comfort seems so small on the universal scale of things. God’s concern for even our thirst is an indication of His tender, personal love.\n\nGod’s final judgment comes to reveal His reign. For all things are His. The whole book of Revelation (indeed the whole canon of Scripture) is about Christ, and this is what it says about Him: He’s seated on a throne (v.17); He is wise and powerful, never caught off guard (v.12 ); He shelters us, and we are safe in Him (v.15); and His gospel is true (v.10).\n\nThe burning fire of God’s judgment is unquestionably a terror to those who do not know Him. But to those who are called by His name—to His own children—the coming of His judgment heralds the setting right of all things. He comes to rescue His children and bring them home.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nThe language in today’s passage is full of rich imagery: a flaming mountain is thrown into the sea, a third of the stars are blackened, and crowned locusts ride horses with scorpion tails into battle. It’s both chillingly specific and massively cryptic—and why are there seven seals, anyway? Before we get carried away, we have to remember that Scripture must first be interpreted through the lens of Scripture. So where else in Scripture do we see the number seven? It’s a parallel to the seven days of creation, the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, Jacob’s seven years of service to Laban, the seven trumpets of Jericho, etc. In God’s Word, seven is a number of completion.\n\nIn all the swirling imagery, the central purpose of all Scripture is to teach the good news of the gospel: Christ has come to save. And the whole book of Revelation is just the same. These judgments show us the completion of God’s good work. And the end purpose of God’s work of salvation is that He should abide with us, and we with Him. He is our God, and we are His people.\n\nBecause we are His, we can rejoice at His coming, and at the restoration of righteousness. Judgment must come. Justice is necessary because He is justice. He will make all things right. He will not allow wickedness to go on forever. \n\nGod’s judgment is total, and our only escape is Jesus. For those of us in Christ, our judgment was paid by Christ at the cross. The weight of our judgment has already fallen on Him. Therefore, we should rejoice at God’s coming judgment, because it will restore righteousness.\n\nWe are His, and so we need not fear any present tribulation. The consequences of evil in this world are scary, and the threat to believers is real. But the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous (1 Peter 3:12). He is always with us, and He cares for us. His ears are open to our prayers, and He is not indifferent to our cries. Even in judgment, God is merciful to those who love Him. \n\nWe need not fear, because we are His. Instead, we can be people of hope, joy, and peace. This is cause for great rejoicing. His justice is ongoing, and this passage is not the final judgment but a picture of God’s ongoing work in the world. He is constantly doling out mercy to us, deferring judgment, calling us back to Him. His work is not done in our families or in our communities. Therefore, have hope for your children, for your parents, and for your neighbors who are not yet believers. God is constantly at work.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nThe Arctic Tern gets more sunlight than any other animal on earth. These birds migrate from pole to pole every year, covering about 25,000 miles. Summering at the north pole, they enjoy weeks of 24-hour sunlight, and at the other end of their migration, they bask in the same full-sun days at the south pole. They literally chase summer all over the globe. If it weren’t so hard, we might all be tempted to do it—imagine a beautiful summer that never ends.\n\nThe point of the whole book of Revelation is the glory of Christ. His glory is so big and so wonderful that I have to imagine endless, gorgeous, sunshine-filled days to get in the right frame of mind. We can’t even grasp what it would be like to live in the glow of His glory, but I know that it will be good. So good.\n\nWe get a glimpse of His glory in the mighty angel standing astride sea and land in today’s reading (Revelation 10:5). Based on the being’s majestic description, many commentators believe this “angel” to be Christ Himself. Regardless of one’s interpretation of this particular passage, however, the whole of Scripture points to this beautiful truth: Christ is worthy. The end result of the judgment and war brings us back to where we began: the Word made flesh mercifully for us.\n\nBecause Christ is worthy, we know that the nations and kingdoms of this world are only temporary. God’s kingdom is the only one that will last. The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever (Revelation 11:15). Christ receives all the kingdoms as His inheritance, which He delivers to the Father (1 Corinthians 15:24–28). And for those who love and trust in Him, the eternal kingdom becomes our inheritance in Christ (1 Peter 1:3–5).\n\nFinally, God finishes His work. “Then he said to me, ‘It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end’” (Revelation 21:6). There is no stopping or undoing what God has done. Our redemption is sure and complete in Christ. And He will bring to completion the work of sanctification and glorification when He comes again. And so we pray: “Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10).\n\nIn Revelation we see Christ, fully worthy and glorified. He is the beginning and the end of all our stories. And we will bask in the warmth and light of His glory for all eternity. It is more than I can imagine. Come quickly, Lord Jesus!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nOne of my favorite hymns is “For All the Saints.” I was reminded of it when reflecting on today’s reading. Every verse of the song compels us to cling to “our Rock, our Fortress,” and “our Captain” in the battle, as we keep our eyes trained toward a more glorious day yet to come. It echoes this truth from Revelation: God is and forever will be seated on His throne, and all the heavenly hosts give glory, honor, and thanks to Him. The hymn continues:\n\nAnd when the strife is fierce, the warfare long; Steals on the ear the distant triumph song.  And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.  Alleluia! Alleluia!\n\nThe strife really is fierce, and it has been since the serpent sowed deceit and destruction in the garden of Eden. Our fear of God, alienation from Him and one another, deceit and pride and endless greed—these things tore the fabric of our human existence before the curse was pronounced upon the serpent. \n\nAnd yet in the midst of Genesis 3, God declared a message of hope that has echoed throughout human history: the offspring of the woman would one day “crush” the serpent’s head (v.15). True, the serpent would “crush” (yes, it’s the same word in Hebrew) the heel of Eve’s offspring—a lethal blow, but one that would end in the greatest, most victorious event in human history: the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. \n\nThat malevolent serpent has since donned many hideous characteristics, and Revelation 12 does not mince words when describing the evil one. We read that the “great fiery red dragon” has been intent on devouring the woman (representing Israel, God’s people) and her Son, Jesus the Messiah. There is an appallingly fierce war in the heavenly realms, one we can hardly imagine. The grim powers of evil and the mighty forces of good tangle with each other. The dragon is identified as the ancient serpent, the devil, who leads the whole world astray. This is serious in the extreme, not to be dismissed with a wave of our enlightened hand. (We often do that.)\n\nIn other words, our battle here on earth is not done. We face the rage of the devil who knows his time is short and his end sure (v.12). But we also know the perspective from God’s throne:\n\nThen I heard a loud voice in heaven say, “The salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have now come, because the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night,  has been thrown down” (v.10).\n\nAs painful as our suffering here on earth is, victory is ours by the blood of the Lamb (v.11). We are empowered by and rest in the assurance that God has made us alive in Christ, that Lamb sitting on the throne. His shed blood has cancelled out the debt we owe, and the enemy has been disarmed completely. The serpent’s head has been crushed at the cross (Colossians 2:13–15). \n\nAlleluia indeed. \n\nElaine A.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nThere is just no way around it. The apocalyptic scene described in Revelation 13 is horrifying. It appears that every possible embodiment of sheer evil will be turned loose on the world—particularly against those who “hold firmly” to the testimony of Jesus (12:17). Add to that, supernatural deception and oppressive brutality will be the all-encompassing order of the day (13:13–17). Everything is utter calamity. How can we possibly face the prospect of such disasters? I don’t know about you, but I’d prefer to simply disappear before the catastrophe begins.\n\nBut what about today, here and now? As we consider our own times, what can we say to encourage God’s people who are currently facing such ferocious animosity? How do we pray for believers whose lives are threatened day in and day out by vicious, nearly unimaginable manifestations of hatred? While Revelation 13 may be part of a much more comprehensive and sober glimpse into the future, there are also crucial lessons for us today.\n\nBottom line for now: there are no easy answers when God’s people are faced with cruel injustices. There are no detours around the painful suffering brought about by those who practice evil. Instead, “this calls for endurance and faithfulness from the saints” (13:10). We are called to stand with those who are subjected to persecution, insults, and unjust treatment (Hebrews 10:33–34). \n\nAnd how can we best do that? With fervent intercessory prayer. Scripture tells us that God is always with us, but with fervent intercessory prayer, we can pray for His presence to be known and felt by those who suffer. We can cry out on their behalf, asking God to grant them peace. \n\nIn talking with friends and acquaintances whose suffering makes my own experiences pale in comparison, I have been both humbled and amazed by what their words have in common. As a result of their truly grim circumstances, they have come to know a deeper intimacy with God. May such be true for all of us!\n\nIt’s difficult to pray well, but it’s important to proclaim God’s “great and precious promises” (2 Peter 1:4) on behalf of those who need endurance for each coming hour. May they (and we) be assured that the One who is coming will not delay (Hebrews 10:37) and that there awaits us “a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 1:11, NIV). We cling to these truths even when everything else seems to give way at the very foundations (Psalm 46). \n\nThat “rich welcome” that awaits God’s faithful and enduring people has stayed generations of believers. The book of Hebrews assures us that we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses as we run the race set before us. I like to think of them cheering on God’s faithful people as we feebly struggle, yet keeping our eyes on “the source and perfecter of our faith” (Hebrews 12:1–2). \n\nElaine A.

We’re told there will be harvests—first the reaping of ripe grain and then the gathering of clusters of grapes for the winepress, God’s wrath. And while the image of God’s wrath and judgment seems unimaginable and terrifying, it’s actually good news: Those who’ve worshiped the beast, the embodiment of evil, and carried out his vicious schemes will one day drink the wine of God’s wrath (14:9–11).\n\nWine is an image reverberating out from Old Testament prophets (Isaiah 51:17–23; Jeremiah 25:15–31; Habakkuk 2:16), through Psalm 75:7–8, and into the garden of Gethsemane (Matthew 26). It’s there that Jesus, knowing full well what was coming, prayed that the “cup” might be taken from Him. Then in utter and complete submission to the perfect will of His Father, He said, “Yet not as I will, but as you will,” and took in the full cup of God’s righteous wrath (v.39).\n\nBut as the redeemed, we have hope, and this is where our hope lies: with the victorious Lamb who takes away the sin of the world and rescues us from God’s coming wrath (John 1:29; 1 Thessalonians 1:10). Until that day, we are called to remain faithful and endure (Revelation 14:12). Death has not yet been dealt its final lethal blow, but in the meantime, we trust in the promise that those saints “who die in the Lord” will one day find “rest from their labors” (v.13). \n\nLooking forward, the author of Hebrews assures us that we are headed for the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the living God. We are headed to the welcome of thousands upon thousands of the angelic host, as well as other believers, whose names are written in heaven. It’s there that Jesus, our perfect Mediator, faithfully intercedes for us, even today (Hebrews 12:22–24).\n\nSo let those who have been redeemed from the hand of the enemy—those gathered from all the lands, east, west, north, and south—give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! (Psalm 107:1–3). Let those from every nation, tribe, language, and people join in a mighty chorus of praise for the Lamb who has overcome. And let us join as a mighty chorus, praising and worshiping “the one who made the heaven and earth” and then redeemed them for eternity (Revelation 14:7).\n\nElaine A.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nWhen it comes to how to respond to the righteous judgment of God, we only have two options. We can worship in wonder or we can wave a rebel fist. There is no middle ground, no gray area, no third option. Just worship or rebellion, reverence or revolt. \n\nHere, in Revelation 15–16 we see a picture of the wrath of God poured out. It’s a terrifying image, bowls filled to the brim with the righteous judgment of God. As squeamish as God’s wrath may make us, deep down, we know He is justified. We look around at mankind and inwardly at our own wicked hearts and must repeat the cry of heaven: \n\n“They deserve it!”…  “Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, True and just are your judgments” (Revelation 16:6–7).\n\nNotice that in these passages, no one is arguing with God’s justice. No scales are needed to weigh and consider the justice of God. Over and over we read that these grisly judgments are in line with a fair and true God. This is justice in its purest form. And yet it’s possible, even when His justice is deserved and devastating, to choose insurrection over His goodness and mercy. Though the judgments certainly take center stage here, there is still an undercurrent of the people’s rebellion within these passages:\n\nThey “blasphemed the name of God… and they did not repent and give him glory” (v.9). They “blasphemed the God of heaven… they did not repent of their works” (v.11).They “blasphemed God” (v.21).\n\nConsider those pummeled by the final bowl of wrath. Though buried under hailstones weighing a hundred pounds, they still shook rebel fists at God. If we are honest with our own hearts, we see that our own rebellious streak runs just as deep. Our own eye for justice is just as distorted. \n\nBut God, in His infinite mercy has unclenched our rebel fists. We are shielded from God’s ultimate judgment and are now “hidden with Christ in God” (Colossians 3:3). Instead of continuing in rebellion, God’s grace has taught us to respond like Israel when the nation witnessed God’s wrath on Pharaoh and His men. \n\n“Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord. They said:\n\n ‘I will sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted; he has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea… \n\nLORD, who is like you among the gods?\n\nWho is like you, glorious in holiness,\n\nrevered with praises, performing wonders?’” (Exodus 15:1,11). \n\nGod’s righteous wrath isn’t all penned up for the Day of Judgment. Even now He judges the wicked. Even now He has the right to rule our hearts and lives. When face to face with His judgment we only have two options. Because He is so worthy, may we choose to worship the God who is just. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nJohn’s prophecy recorded in the book of Revelation is timeless. I am confident he wasn’t zeroed in on our current political climate when he described worldly leaders who were morally bankrupt and drunk on power. And yet, the shoe fits, doesn’t it? Sadly, since the fall of humanity in the garden of Eden, this shoe always seems to fit. \n\nHere in Revelation 17, we see humankind’s perversion of power personified in the prostitute. She is dressed to impress and mired in scandal. She is greedy, flashy, and horrid. I find it hard to look away. This passage has plenty of mysteries, and I won’t claim to understand them all. But life on planet earth has trained me to recognize the distorting effects of power. She is every ruler who has ever reigned and every heart twisted and broken by sin. \n\nShe is presidents and prime ministers, congressmen and counselors. She embodies parents and principals, laws and limitations. But one thing she is not—she is not the Lamb of God. Neither is the beast who is with her. Their rule and reign is fleeting. With that in mind, look closely at how the beast is described: \n\n“The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up from the abyss and go to destruction. Those who live on the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast that was, and is not, and is to come” (Revelation 8, emphasis mine).\n\nStack those words up against these descriptions of Jesus (again, emphasis mine): \n\n“Grace and peace to you from the one who is, who was, and who is to come” (Revelation 1:4).\n\n“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “the one who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty” (Revelation 1:8). \n\n“Each of the four living creatures had six wings; they were covered with eyes around and inside. Day and night they never stop, saying,\n\nHoly, holy, holy,Lord God, the Almighty,who was, who is, and who is to come” (Revelation 4:8). \n\nThe beast will reign until he doesn’t. The prostitute may have a moment in the limelight, but she cannot diminish the Light of the World by a single lumen. Every leader who has ever ruled, every king who has ever been crowned, every circumstance that has ever terrorized you—all will come to an end. But Christ will remain. Only His throne is established forever. \n\nPolitical leaders aren’t the only ones with power over me. If I keep looking inward, at my own power-hungry heart, I see some of me in the prostitute as well. I keep clawing my way back onto the throne that sits in my heart. I keep trying to take control away from the only One who is worthy to rule. Yet, the reign of sin will not last forever inside of me because brokenness won’t always be king of this world. \n\nBecause of Jesus, sin’s power is not ultimate. Sin was, but will be no more. Only the spotless Lamb and His Bride will remain. Long live the King of kings! \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nTheologians with far more degrees on their walls and books on their shelves than I have can continue to debate who Babylon represents in Revelation 18. I simply don’t have the brain cells to compete. But because of the wisdom granted by the Holy Spirit, I do have what it takes to read this passage and consider this question: Where is the redemptive hand of God in these verses?\n\nThe fall of Babylon, like so much of John’s revelation, is mysterious, but when we take a closer look, we see that the gospel thread is clearly present. God’s redemptive work, which stitches all of His Word together, is beautifully and unmistakably revealed throughout this book. \n\nConsider the angel’s loud declaration, “It has fallen, Babylon the Great has fallen!” (Revelation 18:2). And then compare that declaration to Christ’s quiet resolve at the crucifixion: “When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, ‘It is finished.’ Then bowing his head, he gave up his spirit” (John 19:30). \n\nBecause of what He accomplished on the cross, all evil will crumble, every Babylon will fall, all “injustice [will shut] its mouth” (Psalm 107:42). Anything that opposes God will fall. Babylon’s sins were piled up to heaven—so were mine, so were yours—“and God remembered her crimes” (Revelation 18:5). As well He should have. But our transgressions? Our sins? He has forgotten them. \n\n“For I will forgive their wrongdoing, and I will never again remember their sins” (Hebrews 8:12).\n\nI have to remind myself often that God won’t dredge my sin back up. Not now. Not ever. Babylon’s ending is not my own. My sins have been thrown into the depths of the sea. I will receive undeserved grace, but Babylon will receive deserved destruction, paid according to her works of evil, and therefore, earning a double portion of wrath. \n\nBut “He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began” (2 Timothy 1:9). We are spared because of Christ’s work—not punished according to our own. \n\nGod certainly could have wiped me out forever. Instead, He has rebuilt my life on the precious cornerstone of His grace. And so as Christ-followers, we are to “rejoice… because God has pronounced on [Babylon] the judgment she passed” on us (Revelation 18:20).\n\nWicked Babylon is a picture of the enemy’s schemes. Seemingly secure in his triumph, fortified by the forces of darkness, for a fleeting moment he, too, appeared untouchable. And yet, our enemy has fallen. Call it out in a mighty voice! In a single hour he became a defeated foe (v.17). In a moment, with the flash of an angel, the stone rolled away, and evil crumbled. God’s plans for our redemption could not be stopped. Not then. Not now. Not ever.\n\nThe world may weep and mourn when evil crumbles, but heaven will always rejoice. Ours is a God who triumphs over evil. He redeems us for His glory. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nAs most brides do, I had high hopes (and perhaps delusions) that my wedding day would be perfect. For me, it almost was. Almost. \n\nOn a steamy Saturday in May 2001, Chad and I were preparing for our big day. My bridesmaids and I drove to the church and went to the make-shift bridal suite to start getting ready. I don’t remember how long we there before one of my bridesmaids came in and said, “Whit, you need to get upstairs because there’s a massive storm headed our way. If we don’t get you into the sanctuary now, you may have to walk in the rain.”\n\nThe church where we were getting married had two separate buildings. And there wasn’t a way for me to get from where I was to the vestibule, where I would walk down the aisle, unless I went outside. This was our window to avoid the storm, and we needed to go now. \n\nWe gathered up all our stuff and made the trek up to the sanctuary. The gorgeous blue sky that had welcomed us earlier when we first arrived was now hidden by ominous, dark clouds. Yes, a storm was imminent. Happy wedding day to us.\n\nWe piled into the foyer, but quickly realized that it wouldn’t do for the bride to be standing there greeting all the guests when they arrived. The only option we had was to file into the ladies’ restroom. It was like a bad joke: “How do you fit a bride and ten bridesmaids into a bathroom the size of a mid-size sedan?” As it turns out, not easily. \n\nI spent my last hour of single life stuffed into a church bathroom. But through it all though, my bridesmaids— my best friends dressed in sea-foam green (bless them!)—were so kind, faithful, funny, and selfless. Missi, my college roommate, had me laughing. Meredith, my soon- to-be sister-in-law, kept refilling my water. Lori and Ashley were loyal lookouts, reporting back to me who had just arrived. It’s now one of the sweetest memories of my wedding day, each of my friends making sure in her own way that I was wedding-day ready—the most beautiful, confident version of myself I could be. \n\nThe Church, the global and eternal collection of God’s people, is Christ’s Bride, and her wedding day is fast approaching. Despite the gathering clouds of external opposition and internal grumbling, all who are made alive in Christ—single, married, divorced, or widowed—need to be doing our part to make Her wedding-day ready. \n\nIt is theologically true that we, the Church, are the Bride of Christ, beautiful and beloved by Jesus Christ, our Bridegroom (Revelation 21:2). And one day, our wedding and reception, called the marriage supper of the Lamb, will be the most perfect, extravagant party you can imagine (19:6–10). \n\nHowever, I think in some ways we serve another wedding day role: that of bridesmaids. Part of our job is to make sure that the Bride is as lovely and wedding-day ready as she can be. Our goal is for the Bride to look radiant. We are partly responsible for what those outside the Christian faith think of the Bride. \n\nThat might sound good, but maybe you haven’t seen much of the resplendent Bride. Perhaps you’ve been bulldozed by a bit of a Bridezilla instead. And to that, I can relate all too well; I know the pain the Church can inflict. I truly, truly do. But while she may be messy, she is also redeemed. \n\nEven when our hurts are legitimately and deeply wounded, our challenge is to remember that Jesus loves His Bride. He doesn’t ignore her flaws or shortcomings, and He never, ever condones abuse of any kind—but make no mistake, Christ loves the Church He died to save.\n\nToday, we are standing in the vestibule of human history. We can’t know for sure when the doors will swing open and we’ll see Jesus coming for us. Between now and then, let’s do all we can to be ready for our Bridegroom.\n\nWhitney Capps is a national speaker for Proverbs 31 Ministries.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nAs the consummation of redemptive history unfolds, God’s plan is nearly complete, and Revelation 21 and 22 tell us what will be regained and restored. But at this point in the narrative, it’s helpful to remind ourselves not just what we will gain, but what will be lost. \n\nIn the first garden, when sin entered the world, perfection was broken, marred and spoiled. A seemingly unbridgeable chasm was created between what God had intended and what humanity would now experience. Perfection was made imperfect. The devastating effect of our rebellion was all-encompassing, wrecking ourselves, our relationships, and creation. Nothing was left untouched. \n\nSin is the most aggressive of cancers. Let’s look at a few of its fatal symptoms.\n\nSin separates. The first and most catastrophic effect of the fall was how sin destroyed our intimacy with our Creator. Once His friends, we became His enemies. No longer able to enjoy intimate, unbroken fellowship with God, we hid. And as a result of our sin, we were ejected from the garden. In His mercy, God spared Adam and Eve from staying in Eden and eating from the tree of life, which would have left us forever broken (Genesis 3:22–24).\n\nSin sentences us to death. Expelled from Eden, humanity was lost, but not beyond restoration. There is hope for the fallen, but we are not spared death, which is the second consequence of sin. Every person will succumb. No one can escape it. Our bodies are breaking down. Death looms for us and our loved ones. Though we will be raised to life in Christ, most of us will mourn many times over before we see our Maker. Death, mourning, crying, and pain are the result of the fall, full of emotions we were never meant to experience. \n\nSin spoils everything. Not only does sin separate and sentence us to death, it spoils and ruins. Eden was pristine, peace-filled, and perfect. After the fall, what would have been eternally new was now destined for decay. Creation was fractured, and humanity was plunged into conflict with the rest of God’s creatures. Now creation groans and travails awaiting the restoration of what was lost. \n\nThis is the backdrop of Revelation 21. Separation. Ruin. Decay. Death. God isn’t just creating a new heaven and a new earth, glorious as that is. No, He is restoring perfection, ridding us of all the residue and side-effects of sin. Look at what He promises.\n\nWhat sin had separated, God rejoins. For the ancient Near East, water, particularly the sea, represented chaos and danger. Our new heaven and earth won’t have a sea. More profoundly, the chasm between Creator and creation has been closed. God now dwells with His people in a world where sin, decay, and death are no more. Where we once were destined for cyclical mourning, pain, and grief, we are now promised the joy and comfort of dwelling with God forever.\n\nWe were Adam and Eve’s co-conspirators, and we have lived with a death sentence ever since. But our God is now making all things new, putting an end to all that was broken. What we had forfeited, He has restored. \n\nHe was there at the beginning, our Alpha. And He is now standing at the End, our Omega. What He started, He is gloriously finishing.\n\nWhitney Capps is a national speaker for Proverbs 31 Ministries.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nRevelation 21 and 22 paint a lovely picture of the promised end of our story, but we are not home yet. Our destination is certain and secure, but friend, we have not arrived. There is still work to be done.\n\nBelievers living on this side of the cross live in a tenuous “now” and “not yet.” Because of the resurrection of Jesus and the indwelling of His Holy Spirit, we can experience some of the kingdom now. The fruit of the Spirit is a present promise for those of us who surrender to His Lordship. We can enjoy and display love, joy, peace, patience, and kindness today.\n\nWe can grieve in a unique and gospel-centered way. We do not grieve as those who have no hope (1 Thessalonians 4:13). We mourn, but we are comforted by the hope of heaven. We can live in a fallen and fractured world without succumbing to fear or a fatalistic perspective that nothing can redeem the brokenness around us. \n\nThe call to persevere is the command for us to live as sojourners who are passing through to our eternal Promised Land. But we don’t fix our eyes on Jesus, the author, source, and perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:2), to the exclusion of others. We cannot ignore those around us. Not at all. I believe this is why Christ commanded John to write instructions for God’s people before He unfolded what was coming. Revelation opens with a clarion call to the Church, and the letters to the seven churches (Revelation 2–3) should still be the filter through which we view this “end.” We have a job to do, and Jesus expects us to do it well. \n\nWe must persevere in the face of crushing secularism and punishing persecution, passionately clinging to the gospel. When we persevere, we live with the same kind of urgency that moved Jesus to say, “I am coming soon!” (Revelation 22:7). We stay mindful that none of us—not our lost neighbor, sinful co-worker, or rebellious family member—is promised tomorrow. We and the strangers all around us are walking toward a sure judgment. One day grief will be no more, but that day is not today. However, grief does serve a purpose. It arrests our hearts with compassion and compels us to action. We ought to grieve what is coming and then live a life that proclaims the hope that Jesus’s death and resurrection secured. \n\nYes, the kingdom is both now and not yet for you and me. We can experience it now, and we must proclaim it to those who have not yet received it. And whether they persist in doing evil, as Jesus says in Revelation 22, we stay the course in faithfully preaching of the gospel in word and deed. We preach it now because His return is not yet. There is still time, and we must steward it well.\n\nWhitney Capps is a national speaker for Proverbs 31 Ministries.

Hates it. Would rather overpay on taxes while drinking room temperature coffee with sand in his teeth than find himself in the exam room.\n\nBut, this fall I finally took the bull by the horns and made a call to schedule some long-overdue health maintenance checks. Y’all, they didn’t even know his name. He wasn’t in their system. He’d never been seen by a doctor since we moved to Nashville more than eight years ago.\n\nOnce the dates were finally on the calendar, he was really sweating it. Ryan lost sleep for an entire week worrying that the doctor would uncover some terminal illness or lecture him like he was a child about regular well-checks and diet and exercise. He’d waited so long, it felt awkward to show up. He set up camp at the intersection of “ignorance is bliss” and “I can’t bear the judgment” and lived there for years.\n\nI laughed at him then and I still chuckle about it now—so silly to be afraid to be seen by a caretaker. But when I zoom out to a larger picture I realize that, in a lot of ways, I’m just the same in my relationship with my Caretaker.\n\nLord, could we please postpone the “examine my heart” prayer until I’ve got something worth shining your headlamp on?\n\nFather, I’m a mess right now.

We hear each other saying, “I’m broken and guilty,” and we think to ourselves, “If only they knew – it’s me. I’m the worst.” We live in fear of shining a light on the very darkest parts of our hearts—afraid to whisper those dark parts by name, let alone hold them in our outstretched hands in plain sight of the One who bled and died to redeem them.\n\nJesus our Healer, says, “Come.” Yes, you are very sick, but that’s why I’m here!\n\nJesus our Justifier, says, “Come.” Child, you are ill, and I am the only One who can make you well.\n\nWe live in shame and fear, afraid to come into the light until we we know the Physician will be pleased with what He sees. We’re worried we’ve waited too long.

Something’s not right. So, I stop. And I take the time to gently restore each string to its right place so the song will be beautiful again.\n\nAnd, oh, how my heart needs tuning! I forget His goodness. I forget there are “streams of mercy, never ceasing.” I forget that I’m already accepted, covered, held, known, beloved. And when I forget that I’m His cherished daughter, I start hustling for my worth. Grasping for “good” as if I don’t already have access to the Giver of every good thing.\n\nProne to wander, Lord, I feel it.\n\nI’d never play a song with an out of tune guitar, but so often (too often) I am willing to live with a heart that is out of tune.

All because I don’t take the time to restore my heart to its rightful place, to a place of gratitude for a Love that will never leave me.\n\nIt seems that our work as followers of Jesus is to remember. To sing His grace over and over. And because of what He did on the Cross, it’s a song that will never grow old. We can’t sing it too much or too loudly. We can’t wear that record out.\n\nWhile we were still sinners, Love gave Himself up for us, and walked out of the grave, so that we could taste the sweetness of mercy and belonging. That song is powerful. Lord, would you help us to sing it?\n\nI need this hymn. I need the truth that it carries.\n\nIt calls me back to remembering the Fount of every blessing.\n\nIt beckons me to raise up Ebenezer stones. Rocks to remember how God has been my helper. Rocks to remember our Rock.\n\nBecause I’ve got nothing if I don’t have Him. And we HAVE HIM. He stands with open arms, ready to transform our hearts if we’ll but hand them over. Bind us to Your side, Lord Jesus.\n\nWhat might happen if we invited Him to tune our hearts to sing His grace today?\n\n \n\nCOME, THOU FOUNT OF EVERY BLESSING\n\nRobert Robinson, 1735-1790 \n\nCome, thou Fount of every blessing,\n\ntune my heart to sing thy grace;\n\nstreams of mercy, never ceasing,\n\ncall for songs of loudest praise.\n\nTeach me some melodious sonnet,\n\nsung by flaming tongues above.\n\nPraise the mount! I’m fixed upon it,\n\nmount of thy redeeming love.\n\nHere I raise mine Ebenezer;\n\nhither by thy help I’m come;\n\nand I hope, by thy good pleasure,\n\nsafely to arrive at home.\n\nJesus sought me when a stranger,\n\nwandering from the fold of God;\n\nhe, to rescue me from danger,\n\ninterposed his precious blood.\n\nO to grace how great a debtor\n\ndaily I’m constrained to be!\n\nLet thy goodness, like a fetter,\n\nbind my wandering heart to thee.\n\nProne to wander, Lord, I feel it,\n\nprone to leave the God I love;\n\nhere’s my heart, O take and seal it,\n\nseal it for thy courts above.\n\nFind an exclusive hand-lettered print with lyrics from “Come, Thou Fount” in the She Reads Truth shop!\n\nClick below to hear “Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing” on the She Reads Truth |Hymns Spotify playlist. \n\n\n\n \n\n",

And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God… \n\n– Job 19:25-26, ESV\n\nThe last few years had been pretty terrible for the man. He and his wife, Anna, had 4 beautiful children—3 girls and a boy—when scarlet fever stole the life of their only son. The boy was just four years old.\n\nThe family was wealthy; he was a successful lawyer with influential friends. The year after his little boy died, the man invested a sizeable portion of their money in northern Chicago’s growing real estate market. A handful of months later, it was gone—the property and the family fortune destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\n\nBut it’s what came next that undid him.\n\nThe year was 1873, two years after the fire. He sent Anna and their children (there were 4 girls now, one born since the loss of their son) ahead to England for a family holiday. He stayed back on business with the plan of following shortly after. Only, something went terribly wrong. The ship wrecked with another in the Atlantic, and the girls perished at sea. A grieved Anna reached shore and sent her husband a telegram: “Survived alone.”\n\nSurvived alone.\n\nHave you ever felt that sorrow, Sister? Have you ever found yourself standing, lost and suddenly alone, in the wreckage of what was or what might have been?\n\nWe know our Redeemer lives. We believe it, even when we cannot feel it. Yet grief is thick and tangible and our bodies pain under its weight. Whatever and whomever we grieve, the emotions consume and toss us like ragdolls in the waves and we have no energy left to swim. And so we do the only thing we know to do: we give the grief back to God.\n\nWhen a broken Chicago businessman named Horatio Spafford sailed past the very spot on the Atlantic where his baby girls breathed their last, he offered up these words of worship to the God who presides over all the sorrows and the seas, to the One who has borne the whole of our grief and our sin:\n\nWhatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,\n\nIt is well, it is well with my soul.\n\nYes, Lord, haste the day where our faith shall be sight. And may be spend all our days until then offering you our joys, our grief, everything we are. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nText: Isaiah 43:1-3, Psalm 66:8-12, Deuteronomy 31:1-8\n\nIt is the Lord who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed.” \n\n– Deuteronomy 31:8, ESV\n\nI’ll be honest. With everything in me today I want to respond to these scriptures and this incredible hymn on a joyful, super-tidy level. But every time I sit down to write—even in the in-between when I’m avoiding writing—I sense the Lord showing me something I’m not sure I want to see. He’s asking me to share something I’m not sure I want to share.\n\nI don’t want to write about it because it’s so honest it hurts. It’s my sin and it’s ugly and who wants to air that out in public? But as I confess this to the Father, I feel Him nudging me to share some dark-but-now-forgiven parts of me with you, and I hope they may help you feel less alone and confident to repent, too.\n\nThe truth is, I have such a difficult time trusting people that my insecurity can be downright paralyzing. Just last week I spent two full days in a gridlock of fear—unable to function, unable to carry out any of my callings, just a mess of a puddle on the floor. (The opposite of free, you guys. The opposite of joyful.) I struggled with insecurity about the position He’s given me in She Reads Truth and as a writer, I felt ill-equipped to teach anyone anything about God’s precious Word, and I was absolutely terrified that somehow, some way, I would be betrayed or taken advantage of because I just didn’t know any better.\n\nThat’s a lot of honest for one paragraph. If it didn’t pain you to read it, it super pained me to write it. There are seasons when I carry a crippling fear of betrayal around like an old heavy suitcase strapped to my back, and it goes with me everywhere and keeps me from living life the way I’m called to live it. I’ve walked through a number of unspeakable betrayals as a child and as an adult, and I’m sure that’s a lot of why I struggle with this. I tried to tie a neat little bow around it for my husband just the other day, confidently summarizing that I can trust the Lord with abandon, it’s just people that make me crumble sometimes.\n\nBut you guys, it’s still fear. And when my worst case scenarios are played out in my head—or out loud for a friend—at the end of the game I’m never without my Jesus. So do I even really trust Him?\n\nIf I do trust God, then I have nothing to fear and I have every reason for joy. And the question “But what if I suffer?” instead becomes “What am I so afraid of?”\n\nCharles Spurgeon says it this way:\n\n“…if it shall come to pass that for Christ’s sake and the gospel’s you shall endure suffering in any shape, shrink not, but rejoice in the honour thus conferred upon you, that you are counted worthy to suffer with your Lord; and joy also in this – that your sufferings, your losses, and persecutions shall make you a platform, from which the more vigorously and with greater power you shall witness for Christ Jesus.”\n\nWe’re all a mess and we know it. We reason with each other that we trust God, we just don’t trust people—or vice versa. But our Savior lifts our lowered eyes to meet His and says, What are you so afraid of? I will not leave you or forsake you. That’s a promise.\n\nHOW FIRM A FOUNDATION\n\nRobert Keene, 18th century\n\nHow firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,\n\nIs laid for your faith in His excellent Word!\n\nWhat more can He say than to you He hath said,\n\nYou, who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?\n\nIn every condition, in sickness, in health;\n\nIn poverty’s vale, or abounding in wealth;\n\nAt home and abroad, on the land, on the sea,\n\nAs thy days may demand, shall thy strength ever be.\n\nFear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,\n\nFor I am thy God and will still give thee aid;\n\nI’ll strengthen and help thee, and cause thee to stand\n\nUpheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand.\n\nWhen through the deep waters I call thee to go,\n\nThe rivers of woe shall not thee overflow;\n\nFor I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,\n\nAnd sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.\n\nWhen through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie,\n\nMy grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;\n\nThe flame shall not hurt thee; I only design\n\nThy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.\n\nEven down to old age all My people shall prove\n\nMy sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;\n\nAnd when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn,\n\nLike lambs they shall still in My bosom be borne.\n\nThe soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose,\n\nI will not, I will not desert to its foes;\n\nThat soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,\n\nI’ll never, no never, no never forsake.\n\nFind an exclusive hand-lettered print with lyrics from “How Firm a Foundation” in the She Reads Truth shop!\n\nClick below to hear “How Firm a Foundation” on the She Reads Truth |Hymns Spotify playlist. \n\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hebrews 4:15-16, 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, John 15:1-11\n\n“…apart from me you can do nothing.” – John 15:5b, NIV\n\nThe first time I can remember acknowledging feeling completely and utterly in need of Jesus — not just in theory or heart, but emotionally and physically “if you don’t come, Lord Jesus, I’m not gonna make it” in NEED of the Lord — was when my daughter was two years old.\n\nI adore my daughter. She is stubborn and kind and smart and just the right amount of crazy, and I’m in awe of the way God made her. But when she discovered the art of disobedience I thought it would be the death of me. We went head-to-head on a daily basis—me with my expectations and rules and her with her fearless, freakishly-strong toddler will—and more often than not I’d end up in tears.\n\nWhat was wrong with me? Why couldn’t I do this? Why was I so bad at patience and discipline and grace and having fun, and why was I so emotionally fragile that a two year old could push ALL MY BUTTONS?\n\nTo say this was a rough patch in my parenting career would be an understatement.\n\nOh, but that little girl taught me—teaches me!—what grace looks like. She offers it to me like candy, and I offer it back to her. We apologize a lot. We talk about how we want to love each other well and we ask Jesus to help us do that. We ask Jesus lots of things, actually.\n\nI ask Jesus to help me mother. I ask Jesus to help me listen to my friends and really love them. I ask Him to help me look strangers in the eye and really see them.\n\nI ask Jesus to care for all the people I love because there are so many I lose count and I don’t get to hug any of them as often as I wish I could. I ask Him to put a blanket of peace and comfort around my friends with achy hearts.\n\nI ask Jesus to fill in the gaps where I’ve been negligent. I ask Him to forgive me of the damage I’ve knowingly and unknowingly caused, to smooth it over with the holy spackle of His grace. I also ask Him to help me write true stories with odd metaphors.\n\nI ask Jesus for all the things, but I don’t ask Him enough.\n\n“Apart from me you can do nothing.” That’s what Jesus says about us in John 15:5. Do you hear the freedom in that today? You and I don’t have to manufacture our own goodness, our own enoughness. Everything good is from Him and for Him.\n\nThis hymn has always been one of my favorites, but this quote from author Annie Hawks sealed the deal.\n\n“One day as a young wife and mo­ther of 37 years of age, I was bu­sy with my reg­u­lar house­hold tasks. Sud­den­ly, I be­came so filled with the sense of near­ness to the Mast­er that, won­der­ing how one could live with­out Him, ei­ther in joy or pain, these words, ‘I Need Thee Ev­e­ry Hour,’ were ush­ered in­to my mind, the thought at once tak­ing full pos­sess­ion of me.”*\n\nIsn’t that typical of how God loves us? We’re busy doing life the best we can when God gently or not-so-gently nudges us to say, “I’m right here. Can’t you see? I’m what you need.”\n\nMay this hymn be the prayer of heart today and every day.\n\nI NEED THEE EVERY HOUR\n\nAnnie S. Hawks, 1872\n\nI need Thee every hour, most gracious Lord;\n\nNo tender voice like Thine can peace afford.\n\nRefrain\n\nI need Thee, O I need Thee;\n\nEvery hour I need Thee;\n\nO bless me now, my Savior,\n\nI come to Thee.\n\nI need Thee every hour, stay Thou nearby;\n\nTemptations lose their power when Thou art nigh.\n\nRefrain\n\nI need Thee every hour, in joy or pain;\n\nCome quickly and abide, or life is in vain.\n\nRefrain\n\nI need Thee every hour; teach me Thy will;\n\nAnd Thy rich promises in me fulfill.\n\nRefrain\n\nI need Thee every hour, most Holy One;\n\nO make me Thine indeed, Thou blessèd Son.\n\nRefrain\n\n*quote source: cyberhymnal.org\n\nFind an exclusive hand-lettered print with lyrics from “I Need Thee Every Hour” in the She Reads Truth shop!\n\nClick below to hear “I Need Thee Every Hour” on the She Reads Truth |Hymns Spotify playlist. \n\n\n\n",
