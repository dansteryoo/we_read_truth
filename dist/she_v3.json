    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nThere was a time when I was afraid to write. The act of etching my thoughts in ink onto a blank page felt like one of the riskiest things I could do—to declare who I am, reveal what’s inside of me, and then slide it across the table for the rest of the world to see. Even now as I type these words on my laptop in the comfort of home, I am prone to second guess every sentence, every word choice.\n\nSure, I like new beginnings in theory, but in practice they paralyze me. It might be a new calendar, an empty room, a first day, or a clean white sheet of paper staring back at me. Like a rookie film actor stumbling onto set, I’m certain I’ll flub the first take. \n\nBut Genesis is another story. It is the story—our story. The beginning of all beginnings, the book of Genesis is the true history of who we are and where we came from. The first book of the Bible, it is our first glimpse of God’s character in Scripture, of His creation and compassion and His covenant with mankind. And though, yes, we humans dove headlong into sin from the first, our faithful, holy, and steadfast Creator remains true. God is the author and star of this story, and He is the one who invites us in to make it our story as well. \n\nThe book of Genesis presents hard truths about human nature and the fallen world we live in, but it is ultimately a book of hope. God created us—each one of us—to bear His image, and He has not changed His mind (Genesis 1:27). Fear and fallenness plague us here on earth, but God will one day bring us home to the perfect peace of His presence. Until then, we are called to “be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it,” to extend God’s plan for Eden throughout the whole earth (v.28). \n\nOne day, we will know and experience our Creator’s presence face to face—in perfect peace, whole, and unashamed—just as Adam and Eve once did long ago (Genesis 1:25; Revelation 22:4). That is the life we were created for, the intimate relationship we were always meant to enjoy with Him. One day, even death itself will die, and we will get the fresh start we’ve always longed for—the perfect new beginning, free from fear. \n\nGenesis lays the foundation for everything else we read in Scripture. Our prayer is that this reading plan serves to draw you further into God’s Word, that it would bring you to a deeper knowledge of the God who made you and a deeper longing for His presence. He alone knows the end from the beginning, and we can rest in Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nWe have a painting in our home, one depicting a distraught Eve being comforted by a pregnant Mary, who is wiping away Eve’s tears. Her eyes focused on Mary’s belly, she reaches out to touch it, even as her own heel is trampling the serpent’s head (Romans 16:20). It’s an achingly beautiful, succinct depiction of what we lost in Eden, and of God’s never-ceasing pursuit to return us to right relationship with Him. \n\nGod’s pursuit of relationship with us is there from the start, in the beginning of His Word. From Genesis 1 and 2, we discover how God formed the earth and everything in it, including man and woman, who He made in His image (Genesis 1:27). He gives Adam and Eve the radical opportunity to rule over the world with Him, cultivating its growth. And out of His relational love for them, He gives them a choice about how they will live and work in this world: will they choose to follow God’s way and His wisdom and instruction for life, or will they choose a different kind of wisdom, one that relies on self-sufficiency and autonomy, apart from Him?\n\nGod has already provided Adam and Eve with everything they need to carry out this task, instructing them on what is good for them and what is not (“the tree of the knowledge of good and evil” [vv.16–17]). Prior to the serpent’s persuasive lie (3:4–5), enticing them to their own brand of knowledge, humanity dwelled in perfect harmony with God and one another. But after choosing to eat from the forbidden tree, “the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked” (3:7). From this point forward, discontent and shame would be a part of the human condition, disobedience would drive a wedge between creation and Creator. \n\nWhen God asked Adam and Eve where they were that day in Eden (3:9), He already knew, of course. It makes me think the question was certainly more for their sake than His—it had to be. He asks where we are, too, all the while knowing all the dark places we run to, the many ways we attempt to hide our hearts from Him. But He pursues us all the same, fully aware that while He will ultimately defeat the serpent, that same enemy still actively seeks to destroy us (John 10:10), to lure us away from the God who adores us.\n\nI looked at that painting again today. We’ve had it for maybe a decade, but to this day, if I look at it too long, it never fails to wake me to the indifference of my own sin, to the lie of self-sufficiency—it wrecks me. \n\nHonestly, that’s where I’m at today. What about you?\n\nIf God were to ask, “Where are you?”, what would you tell Him? Do you believe it’s safe to come out of hiding? Do you trust that our Creator knows what’s best for His own creation? The God of Genesis 1 and 2, is the same God here in chapter 3; He does not change (Hebrews 13:8). He is still in the business of covering our shame with His own righteousness—even when we disobey Him (Genesis 3:21; Romans 5:8,19). Wherever you are, He waits for you.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nMy children are currently in a difficult season of discipline. On a daily basis, usually multiple times a day, I dispense consequences for bad behavior, which are then met with responses of total shock and horror. \n\n“I didn’t do anything!”  “I didn’t know!”  “I didn’t hear you!”  “But his face ran into my fist!” \n\nLike generations of children before them—including myself!—my kids are gifted at playing the martyr. Rather than repent and ask forgiveness, they make excuses. And sometimes, they dig in their heels even deeper. \n\nHere in this story of the very first murder, we see where this blame-shifting began. And it all started very innocently. Two competitive brothers—one a farmer, one a shepherd—bring offerings to God. Cain brings the fruits of his soil, and Abel brings fat portions from the firstborn of his flock (Genesis 4:3–4). At first glance, it would appear that each brother brought what he had, but God does not see it this way. God looks with favor on Abel’s offering, but he withholds favor from Cain.\n\nWhy?\n\nIn their commentary on this passage, Tremper Longman and Scot McKnight explain the difference in their gifts: “Cain offered the ordinary and Abel the best, and of course the quality of their offering reflects the condition of their hearts. Abel is enthusiastic about worship, while Cain is basically disinterested.”\n\nCain is caught doing the bare minimum, but rather than humble himself, admit his spiritual apathy, and ask how he can do better, Cain digs in. He becomes angry. He throws a pity party. He nurses his bitterness until it culminates in murder, and even after all that he continues to play the victim: “My punishment is too great to bear” (v.13).\n\nIn these early chapters of Genesis, we are learning about the ways of God, but we are also learning about the ways of sin, and here we observe a major hallmark. Human sin is so utterly broken that it will even deny its brokenness. It will run, hide, make excuses, and lash out before taking responsibility and repenting, and this is an important thing to know about ourselves. When accountability comes our way, even if it comes harshly or imperfectly, our response determines the course of our lives. How we respond to sin sets our feet on one of two paths: back to God, or further away from Him. \n\nBut here is what else this story reminds us, and I hope this sets you free: sometimes we are the ones being confronted, but sometimes we are the ones doing the confronting. Sometimes, we bring truth to light and then, just like God does in this story, have to watch as a loved one hardens their heart all the more. This, we must remember, is not about us or our shortcomings or how we could have said it better. It’s about sin, and what it does to the human heart. \n\nThankfully, we have something that Cain didn’t have: the Holy Spirit. Through the gift of God’s Son, Jesus Christ, we have a helper and an advocate who is ready to work when repentance feels too hard. That is how good God is—even as He asks us to be faithful, He helps us to do it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nA couple years ago, God called my husband and me to something scary. Ike quit his secure church job with a regular salary and generous benefits to strike out and start a new church. We had no idea how it would turn out, whether we were adequately equipped, or whether it would succeed or fail. But we trusted God, so we obeyed and went. \n\nDuring that season, we relied on a number of stories in the Bible to buttress our faith. Whenever we needed a reminder about God’s gracious willingness to confirm a hard call, we read about Gideon. Whenever we needed to stand on God’s ability instead of our own, we read about Moses. And whenever we wrestled with the loneliness and fear of stepping into a seemingly illogical call, we read about Noah.\n\nNoah’s story is remarkable for two reasons, one which is obvious and one which is not. The obvious reason is Noah’s faithfulness in an unfaithful generation. Genesis 6:1–5 describes an era in human history that was so dark, so depraved, that it prompted God to declare “I regret that I made them” (v.7). The human race was unraveling, and yet there was Noah, “a righteous man, blameless among his contemporaries” (v.9), who managed to resist the moral current of his day. \n\nThis fact about Noah, on its own, makes him an exceptional person. But here is the less obvious, but equally remarkable truth about him: Noah was the first person recorded in Scripture to be asked to take a big leap of faith. To put it another way, Noah didn’t have the heroic stories of God to turn to that we do. No histories of God using the unlikely, or confirming a hard call, or rescuing a desperate people, or most importantly, sending a Savior. \n\nSo when God called Noah to something strange and nonsensical—building a boat, in the middle of the land, with no flood in sight—Noah had little to no record of God’s faithfulness in history. All he had was his own knowledge of God.\n\nBut how did he acquire it? \n\nGenesis 6:9 tells us that Noah “walked with God,” which is an intentionally active verb. He didn’t simply know God; he did life with God. He drew near to God, he followed God, he honored God, and he served God, and this was how he learned about God. He didn’t have a long historical record of the deeds of God, but he wrote one with his own life. \n\nMillenia later, as a people of God who possess generations of stories of God’s faithfulness to ordinary people, the witness of Noah reminds us of something important. As much as these stories are a gift and a help when faith is hard, one of the most important ways we know God’s character and get to know Him more intimately, is not simply by reading about Him. It’s through walking with Him. It’s through obedience. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nRecently, I met with someone who was agonizing over a big life decision. She wanted to make the right choice, and she was terrified of making the wrong one. But her fear was not simply about discerning God’s will. It was about disappointing God. Or worse, failing Him. If she made the wrong decision with the wrong motivation, she worried that God would punish her for it.\n\nThis is, not surprisingly, a common fear among Christians. Many followers of Jesus live with the unsettling worry that God will judge us for our sin, despite receiving His gift of grace and salvation. Either consciously or subconsciously, we operate out of a place of fear rather than love, and it’s often because of stories like Noah and the flood. \n\nThis fear of judgment would be understandable if the flood—or any judgment from God—were the end of the story, but thankfully, it is not. Instead, the flood is only a chapter in a bigger, redemptive plan.\n\nWhat we encounter in the chapters following the flood is a second story of creation. It’s as if God wipes the slate clean and begins again. In the same way God directed Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply, He commands Noah to do the same (Genesis 9:1). Noah is, in some sense, a new Adam. \n\nHowever, what is different from that first creation is the presence of sin. Humanity’s relationship with God has fundamentally changed, which makes this story fundamentally different. He explains what it means to be His people and what He expects of them, but He also promises never to rain down this kind of judgment again (v.11). \n\nGod calls these commands and His promise a “covenant,” which is significant. What God is offering is not a cold, legal “contract,” but a relational covenant that is instituted and upheld by God, and here is why all of this matters: In these opening chapters of Genesis, we are learning about who God is. God is just and He will not be mocked, and we see this in His judgments. But, God is also a rescuer and a redeemer who gives everything He has to deliver us. \n\nIn every story that follows, God affirms these two things: this covenant, and His commitment to preserve His people. And ultimately, He fulfills it in Christ. Jesus receives our judgment and achieves our redemption, and then makes this restoration available to all who enter this covenant through Him.\n\nThat is why we can read these stories of God’s wrath without fear. Sin has consequences and God is indeed just—but the judgment has been dispensed. Because of Christ, God looks upon us in all our weakness and mistakes, and promises, “Never again.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nMy dad is a talented woodworker, and one year he built my brother and me an elaborate treehouse in our backyard. It was the talk of the town. There was a fire escape pole, a sandbox, a gymnastics bar, and a slide. He built it so high it just fit within coding limits established by the California building department. While it may seem like his motivation was a defiance of building permits, it was really an extravagant gesture of love. He wanted our treehouse to be as big and awesome as a treehouse could be.\n\nIn Genesis 11, the motivation for building a really tall tower wasn’t quite as pure. After settling in Shinar, the people were afraid of being scattered throughout the earth (Genesis 11:2). Although God’s command to be fruitful and multiply implies expansion into surrounding lands, the people liked it right where they were. They didn’t want to leave and, instead, decided to construct a tower to “make a name” for themselves (v.4). They likely built a ziggurat—a temple that was supposed to bridge the gap between heaven and earth, a place where they believed they could communicate with the gods. This was a way for them to claim the territory as their own and, hopefully, avoid being scattered. \n\nIn contrast with this story, when Abram received God’s call of pilgrimage to a new land, he responded by building a stone altar (Genesis 12:1–7). Unlike the tower, this wasn’t a symbol of human achievement or possessiveness. It was an offering to the Lord. Although we find countless biblical characters building things—arks, walls, altars, towers—the inner motivation behind these outward acts is different in each case. Some are born out of self-protection. Others out of worship. \n\nIt’s so easy to become possessive, isn’t it? We find something we want, plant a flag in the ground, and we don’t let go. Understandably, we all long for something—a patch of land, a community, a reputation. But our desires can become all-consuming and corrupt when left unchecked. Suddenly, instead of surrendering those desires to God out of obedience, we fight tooth and nail to keep them. \n\nWhatever we’re building, may we work more from a desire to offer it all as worship to God than to protect our own self-interests.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nToday’s reading is packed with action: famine strikes, Pharaoh gets deceived, Abram is kicked out of Egypt. It’s the making of a great summer blockbuster. After Lot and Abram’s respective herdsmen begin quarrelling about their small quarters, Abram sets a boundary. In an attempt to maintain harmony, he gives Lot the hard truth and asks him to separate from the group and make his home elsewhere. “Isn’t the whole land before you?” Abram asks, perhaps with a sweeping gesture of his arm (Genesis 13:9). The surrounding plain of the Jordan River was lush and ready for the taking (v.10). \n\nAfter Lot gets himself in all sorts of trouble, Abram comes through and rescues him. I imagine he was a little agitated by his nephew’s actions, but it wasn’t in his nature to abandon him to his own folly. With the sweat and dirt of conquest still fresh on his clothes, he’s given bread and wine as the priest Melchizedek proclaims: “Abram is blessed by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth” (Genesis 14:19).\n\nWas Abram blessed by God because he was a victorious warrior? A protective uncle? Although, in this case, it may look like blessing is synonymous with circumstantial favor, we have to dig a little deeper. Abram isn’t necessarily blessed because He was delivered from his physical enemies. We know from other passages in Scripture that this predictable, cause-and-effect sort of way isn’t how God works. So, why does Melchizedek give him this blessing?\n\nThe second part of the message the priest brings is “blessed be God Most High who has handed over your enemies to you” (v.20). It appears that Abram isn’t the only one who is blessed—God is, too! Ultimately, God gets the glory for delivering Abram over to his enemies, and it’s His own power and blessing that covers Abram. \n\nJust as Abram was blessed by the God Most High, so are we. Our blessing isn’t dependent on releasing nephews from captivity (although I’d like to think we’d rise to the occasion), but just as Melchizedek came bearing bread and wine, Christ extends His own body and blood to us. When we accept His gift, we enter into abundant life. We are blessed not because of our own merit but simply because He blesses us. Today, let’s carry this story with us as a reminder that God is at work in our lives. Whether in physical circumstances or matters of the heart, He has called us blessed because we are first, and foremost, His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nIn his book, Beyond Words, Frederick Buechner says this: “Here is the world. Beautiful and terrible things will happen. Don’t be afraid.” Buechner is echoing Christ’s words in the Gospel of John, where we’re told to take heart because Christ has overcome the world (John 16:33). There are many times when personal loss makes it feel as if God has removed His provision, and sometimes it takes everything in me not to project the actions of others onto my faithful Father, who has proven His provision in the past. \n\nAlthough today’s passage records God’s covenant with Abram, I can’t help but notice the part Sarai plays in this story. First, she experiences the disappointment of infertility, fearing it to be God’s prevention of her potential family line. She takes action by asking her husband to sleep with their slave, Hagar, to produce an heir. “Perhaps through her, I can build a family,” she reasons (Genesis 16:2). So, not only must she endure her husband’s intimate relations with their slave, but she also grows to resent Hagar after the very thing she hoped for comes to pass—Hagar’s pregnancy. \n\nHer own infertility must have felt emphasized by Hagar’s growing body. I imagine Sarai looking at Hagar and thinking this new life should have her features, her hairline, her DNA. So, what did Sarai really want? Did she want Abram to push back against her plan? Go at it with God? As emotionally complicated as her situation was, in the end, it was only God’s plan that could ease the depth of Sarai’s distress.\n\nThere’s an eerie line in this passage after God reveals that Abram’s offspring will be as countless as the stars. It describes how, after the sun set, “a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the divided animals” (Genesis 15:17). After Abram sacrificed the animals that God requested, this strange apparition appeared. However, God’s presence was often associated with fiery images in the Old Testament, and according to the Faithlife Study Bible, that night “the passage of fire ratified the covenant.”\n\nThere’s a reason God often tells His followers not to be afraid. Famine and battles, new land ownership and elderly maternity, flaming objects that move on their own—these are not things you see every day. But these are the sort of plot twists God delights in using to develop trust in His people and further His kingdom. Still, He understood how alarming all this must have been for Abram and consoled him by saying, “Do not be afraid… I am your shield” (v.1). \n\nDo not be afraid, friends. God is our shield. Before taking matters into our own hands, let’s believe that God is for us, not against us. Let’s give Him the benefit of the doubt and wait for His redemptive movement in our lives (Romans 4:20).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nFour years ago, the university where I was working went through financial difficulties and laid off several recent full-time hires. I was one of them. It was devastating since our team was like a close family. After reestablishing financial stability, they extended an offer to come back one year later; and because I was juggling part-time gigs at the time, I accepted. Here’s the crazy thing: it was a far better role than before and wound up being the closest thing I’d ever had to a dream job. The experience led to one of those moments when you think: I sure wouldn’t want to go through that again, but I’m so happy things worked out the way they did. I couldn’t wait to share the good news with my family and, like Abram, say in amazement: “Is anything impossible for the LORD?” (Genesis 18:14). \n\nIn Genesis 18, both Abraham and Sarah laugh after the Lord says they’ll have a son in one year’s time. What a crazy claim! Being in their autumn years, how would they have the strength and endurance to raise a child? Abraham responds by laughing to himself and asking if a hundred-year-old man and ninety-year-old woman can have a baby (Genesis 17:17). It’s a legitimate question. But God isn’t even close to being done working the miraculous into Abraham’s story. \n\nGod came through for them. He gave them a son, demonstrating it had always been His intention to further their family line. And the story didn’t end there. God not only chose to make Abraham a father, but also the father of many nations and the root of Christ’s lineage (vv.4–5). It wasn’t about how tired or advanced in years the couple was now; it was about the kingdom. \n\nThe reason why it’s so important to remember how God worked for our good in the past is because it anchors our trust for the future. My story didn’t have to end with returning to that university, just like Abraham and Sarah’s story didn’t have to end with a male heir. God could shape us and build His kingdom in a million different ways. In the end, we’re left in awe and wonder, laughing and marveling, just like Abraham and Sarah. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nAs I read about the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, I couldn’t help but think of Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Toward the conclusion of the film adaptation, we see the Pelennor Fields lying in smoky ruins after battle. It’s a scene of utter and complete destruction. I remember watching this scene for the first time, wondering as the camera panned out if there’d be a familiar character still alive among the wreckage. I wanted to see a remnant of the good guys, to know that mercy had been shown to at least one person. Or hobbit. Or elf.\n\nMany of us hear words like “grace” and “mercy” and immediately jump to Jesus and the New Testament. But since we know that Christ is “the exact expression” of God’s nature (Hebrews 1:3), it won’t do to consider God in the Old Testament any less gracious or merciful.\n\nGod’s mercy is not hard to find in the Old Testament. It’s woven throughout the book of Genesis like a flowering vine, connecting the stories in Christ’s lineage. Even when people continue to make bad decisions that bring about their own demise or widespread catastrophe, God’s desire is for people to be saved (2 Peter 3:9). We see the ultimate display of God’s mercy in His Son, Jesus Christ; through the power of His resurrection, there is healing for the world (Isaiah 53:5). \n\nDuring his exchange with Abraham, God listens to Abraham’s plea and gives the people a chance. “The LORD said, ‘If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake’” (Genesis 18:26). They continue to talk, and that number of fifty is reduced to only ten (v.32). But sadly not even ten can be found. God still saves Lot—Abraham’s nephew and the familiar face Abraham knows and loves. God’s mercy is always there and greater than we expect, even when most people reject it.\n\nWithout Christ, it’s our own hearts that resemble that plain of smoking ruins. Even after receiving the Holy Spirit, we still wrestle with sin. We routinely choose to submit to our own will instead of the Spirit. Our sins may not seem as flagrant as those of Sodom and Gomorrah, but we are all sinners in need of grace. \n\nHallelujah! Christ has broken the curse of sin and death. Even now, Christ—the exact expression of the Old Testament God with whom Abraham bargained and pleaded for the lives of his community—invites us to accept the gift of eternal life. He is for us, and His mercy is greater than we think. Remembering this, may we echo Abraham’s plea for the redemption of our own hearts, our city, and our world. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nI’ve never been pregnant. I’ve come to terms with the fact that, like Sarah (or Rachel or Hannah) in the Bible, I have been given the burden of infertility, a weight that I’ve kicked and railed against and sobbed about and finally, dutifully picked up—mostly because I had no other option. I don’t know if I will ever have a child born from my own body, but I know that if I did, I would join right along with Sarah in laughing. \n\nGod’s timing is perfect, and sometimes, pretty funny too. To think, Sarah had waited her whole life to have children, and only once her family was in disarray, did God choose to follow through on His great promise. After everything that happened, why now? Because when she was at her weakest, once again, He showed His great strength.\n\nThe Bible is full of humans, not heroes. We see in Genesis chapter 20 a story of fear, when Abraham tries to hide and protect his wife Sarah by claiming that she was his sister, only to nearly cause a massive tidal wave of destruction for Abimelech. What follows in close succession is Sarah finally giving birth to the child God promised: Isaac.\n\nBut even amidst the laughter and celebration, a shadow hovers over this family. After all, they didn’t wait patiently for God to follow through on His promise. Earlier in their marriage, Sarah encouraged her husband to have an affair with Hagar in order to bear a child. Now, she can’t fully enjoy God’s faithfulness, because the proof of her unfaithfulness is right there, mocking her, at the party. \n\nAre we any different? When God is good to you, what do you focus on? Are you wholeheartedly clinging to His goodness, or do you still see, out of the corner of your eye, glimpses and reminders of your own sin, lack, and shame? After all, how good can He really be? We see the answer in the second half of chapter 21.\n\nEven when Sarah sends Hagar and Ishmael away in a fit of rage, God continues to be good to them. He is loving and saving and kind—because that is who He is. It doesn’t matter if you see yourself as a promised child or a child whose background is questionable. None of this is conditional on who we are or what we’ve done, but rather on who He is and what He accomplished on the cross. \n\nGod’s promises always come true. He has promised to forgive our sins and guide our hearts, leading wherever He pleases (Proverbs 21:1). He promises to give us everything we need for life and godliness (1 Peter 1:3). He promises to come for us, and not to leave us as orphans (John 14:18). The Lord did for Sarah all that He had promised. The Lord will keep His promises to us as well. That is who He is. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nI really didn’t want to be assigned this passage. I’ve been a Christian most of my life, and still, when I read this passage about Isaac and Abraham walking up the mountain, I simply want to throw my Bible across the room. Why in the world would God ask Abraham to do this?\n\nThere are a host of things that God asks His people to do—things that, without faith and understanding of context surrounding these passages, seem really wild. Earlier in Genesis, God asked Abraham to circumcise every man in his household, even his servants. Today, Christians are asked to live in obedience to a lot of biblical commands which make no sense to the world and its culture today. We’re asked not to have sex outside of marriage. We’re asked to think of others as better than ourselves. We’re asked to go out of our way to give to and love others—even our enemies. These commands might seem obvious if you’ve been in church for a long time. But outside of the lens of faith, they really make no sense at all. Only God can give us the strength and faith needed to obey Him. \n\nAnd so, I’m left to believe that God must have given Abraham the strength and faith to obey even this—this seemingly insane command. Why would God have Abraham sacrifice this child, who he and Sarah had waited and longed for throughout the course of their lives? Why this child of the promise? If you remember Genesis chapter 21, you’ll recall that Abraham had just sent his other child, Ishmael, away. So now, if he were to go through with the sacrifice of Isaac, he would have no children at all. \n\nBut Abraham trusted God. He trusted that God was good. Abraham had learned that obedience to God brings greater blessing than pain. So, if God was asking him to surrender to something painful—something as horrific as losing his only son—then there must be an even more abundant blessing on the other side.\n\nI’m not sure I would have had the faith to walk up that mountain. But because Abraham obeyed, we now get to witness, through Scripture, the first example of substitutionary sacrifice, as God provides a ram in the thicket. Do you know who else walked up a mountain that led directly to an inconceivable sacrifice? Jesus.\n\nOnly when Jesus walked to Calvary, when the Roman guard slammed hammer into steel, through flesh, there was no ram in the thicket (Genesis 22:13). Jesus, the King of kings and Lord of lords, became God’s autobiography on earth. And God’s nature is not punitive—it is sacrificial. Jesus willingly obeyed the Father to the point of death—even to death on a cross (Philippians 2:8). And because of His supernatural, unexplainable, indescribable obedience, we now have peace with God. Thanks be to God for obedience and the peace that comes with it—things that we may not be able to understand, but can only pray to the strength and faith to emulate. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nIn 2009, I moved to Nashville to take a job at a middle school that had no central heat or air. That summer was hot, and I spent day after day in my new classroom, cleaning out closets stuffed with books, mice feces, and dust. By the end of my first week in a new city, I was exhausted, friendless and scared that I’d made a huge mistake in taking this job. \n\nThat weekend, a friend reached out and invited me to a concert with a group of friends. “This guy Patrick is planning it,” my friend told me. “Here’s his number.” Maybe I was desperate for new friends. Maybe all that time in an airless classroom made me bold. But I called, and a man with a deep, soothing voice answered the phone. Patrick and I talked for a long time. When we met later that night, I saw in his eyes something familiar and kind. Much to everyone’s surprise, we were engaged five months later. People thought we were crazy, and for the record, let me say this: we were.\n\nIsaac and Rebekah have an even crazier origin story. Camels, water troughs, long distances across foreign lands, prayers to God—all accumulated to create an arranged marriage between two people whose lives God would use to change the course of history. Their story is full of the kind of inexplicable coincidences that help us see God’s hand at work. I mean, what are the chances that Abraham’s servant would arrive at this well, at this hour? He asks her for water, and waits to see if this young woman will offer to quench the thirst of his camels as well. He’s searching for kindness, for goodness, for industrious character. And he finds it in Rebekah, the very first woman he meets.\n\nWhat are the chances?\n\nAs a Christian, I believe that God is constantly at work, guiding His people in the way they should go. Scripture tells us that “a person’s steps are established by the LORD,” and that “all [our] days were written in [His] book” (Psalm 37:23; 139:16). “We are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works which he prepared in advance for us to do” (Ephesians 2:10). These are comforting truths when things seem to be going our way, but not so much when our circumstances seem to go awry, veering off into an unexpected direction. But even then, God is our protector, who never sleeps or slumbers (Psalm 121:4). He is always engaged with our lives, whether we realize it or not. \n\nAnd so it was with Isaac and Rebekah. Their story reminds me that God builds unlikely families, restores broken relationships, and heals us from what seems irreparable apart from Him. He promised to build a family through Abraham and his descendants, a family line that would eventually lead to the Messiah, our Savior Jesus, who was born into this world to redeem His own Bride, the Church. \n\nAfter pursuing and finding a bride for Isaac, his servant “knelt low [and] worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD,” the God of Abraham (Genesis 24:48). Jesus Christ pursued His own Bride, even to the point of death on a cross. May our response be to turn to Him in worship, thanking Him for His faithful love and mercies that never end (Lamentations 3:22–23).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nWhen I was seven years old, my family went to Disney World. At the time, we lived in Virginia, which meant that in order to get to Space Mountain, we had to drive from the D.C. area all the way to Orlando. To survive an eleven-hour drive with three daughters under the age of fourteen, my parents came up with a plan. They told us that when we got to Disney World, we would all get $50 as spending money, but that any misbehavior during the drive would lead to a deduction from that amount. And so the drive began.\n\nA few hours later, their plan had backfired. Rather than sitting quietly, trying to maintain our $50 allowances, my sisters and I had devised a game of our own, in which we attempted to provoke one another into losing more and more of their allowance. Anytime one of us misbehaved, my mother would take out her notepad where she was keeping track of deductions. While one sister sulked, the other two would pull down an imaginary lotto-lever and shout “cha-ching!” \n\nWe weren’t all that nice to one another. But our misbehavior pales in comparison to the sibling rivalry recounted in the story of Jacob and Esau, twin brothers who came out of the womb as enemies. And their parents were no help. From the beginning, Isaac and Rebekah chose favorites, and that favoritism only stoked the enmity between these brothers.\n\nAt stake in this passage is Esau’s birthright, the inheritance he stood to receive as the firstborn of his family. Knowing the value of that inheritance, Jacob plotted against his older brother, as if land and money were a finite resource. Meanwhile, Esau didn’t place adequate value on his birthright. He was “immoral and irreverent,” selling “his birthright in exchange for one meal” (Hebrews 12:16). Know this: favoritism and strife is not God’s plan. In fact, the Mosaic Law will later forbid a father from favoring a younger son merely because he comes from a preferred wife (Deuteronomy 21:15–17). But for now, we see that Jacob uses the means at his disposal to manipulate his way into wealth. \n\nGod is not interested in breaking up families over dollars and cents. Perhaps the greatest problem with Jacob and Esau’s behavior is that they both forgot God’s character. They forgot that the same God who blessed Isaac also blessed Ishmael. God never runs out of goodness. He does not “dock” us for misbehavior, nor will He look favorably upon those who provoke others into deceit. God’s goodness exists equally for His dearly loved children. We know this, because Jesus calls us His friends (John 15:!5). \n\nJesus, the most favored Son of all, gave us the right to become His brothers and sisters, His co-heirs to the kingdom (Romans 8:17). He is willing to share the blessing. He knows there is more than enough blessing to go around.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nThis morning, I opened up Facebook to discover that a celebrity picked my friend’s book for her highly influential book club. Rather than experience a surge of excitement for my friend, I felt the sinking pull of sadness. I didn’t even pause for a moment to feel happy for my friend; instead, I rushed to despondency, dejection, defeat. One question screamed loudly, over and over again in my mind: Why not me?\n\nPeople have plenty of conversations these days about the dangers of comparison, but I rarely hear the “j” word: jealousy. Jealousy is dirty. It’s dark and venomous and seeps into my consciousness like poison. In those moments, I’m not just wishing I had it better; I’m wishing that the other person had it worse. Yikes. I try to swallow the sadness—I leave a comment, I say congratulations—and I mean it… eventually. But my initial reaction isn’t charitable or kind. \n\nMy heart’s natural posture isn’t to hope for the blessing of others; it’s to hoard every good thing for myself. I have to keep that ugly truth in mind as I read today’s passage. I’m not all that different from Jacob. And if I had the chance to skew my future for the better, I might just put on some goatskins too. \n\nThe rivalry between these brothers, stoked by the favoritism in their parents, creates a toxic ripple effect that flows out for many generations. In yesterday’s reading, Jacob entrapped Esau, and Esau stupidly traded his birthright for a bowl of soup. In today’s passage, Jacob schemes with his mother Rebekah to steal even more from Esau: his father’s blessing. Words are powerful, but these aren’t just words. When Isaac speaks a blessing over Jacob, he’s passing along a divinely ordained covenant with Yahweh. He’s telling the family secret. He’s bringing Jacob into the Abrahamic covenant, and essentially saying, “Through your family, God will redeem the world.”\n\nI have to wonder why Rebekah was so adamant that Jacob become the favored, blessed son. Maybe Esau was not that bright? We know he traded a huge inheritance for a bowl of soup. We’re told his wives were a thorn in Rebekah’s side. Maybe she saw that Esau’s poor choices could negatively impact the future. But no matter what her reason for favoring Jacob, her methods to secure his position were totally wrong. She offers no directness, no honesty. She initiates no difficult conversations. Her only tactics are manipulation and deceit.\n\nThe Bible is full of humans, not heroes. And yet, God still fulfills His promises to His people. Despite the fact that Jacob is a master manipulator, God continued to work out His plan through these sinful people, moving history ever closer toward a Savior who could save us from our jealousy, our deceptions, our fears. \n\nJesus lived a perfect life. He didn’t have to scheme to receive anything, because He created everything. And yet, for the joy set before Him—including an eternity spent with you and me—He endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God (Hebrews 12:2; 1:3). And now, we have a brother in heaven. And He is the best brother, because He wants to share the gifts of His family with us (Romans 8:16–17). He hoards nothing.\n\nEven when I am faithless, He is faithful. Even when I am jealous, He is there, ready to forgive and put salve on those self-inflicted wounds. Even when I scheme to build my own earthly kingdom, Jesus gently turns my eyes back to the city with eternal foundations—the one built by God, and shared with me (Revelation 21:7). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nMy family recently subscribed to a new television streaming service, one that walks me down memory lane with beloved after-school TV shows and movies that I watched as a kid. Revisiting those stories, and sharing them anew with my daughters, has been so much fun.\n\nNarratives shape us. Good stories can awaken our desire for eternity, reminding us of the good in the world, while lifting the veil on the darkest parts of the human experience. \n\nI think the story of Jacob and his two wives, sisters Leah and Rachel, checks all of those boxes. It is a story brewed in brokenness and stirred with deceit, envy, and deep sadness. As a kid, I thought it was so very sweet, a little like a fairy tale: How romantic that Jacob loved Rachel enough to work for seven years to marry her! \n\nBut revisiting the story as an adult unlocks deeper truths about what I’m reading. Laban used his power to deceive Jacob into fourteen years of labor. Leah was cast aside and considered ugly, while Rachel gloated over her favor with Jacob—that is, until Leah bore sons, while Rachel could not. What a desperately sad story about two broken marriages, rival sisters, and a deceptive uncle who repeatedly manipulated his kin for profits. \n\nJacob was deceived. Leah was rejected and unloved. Rachel was emptied out by envy. Laban saw profits instead of people. \n\nWhen Leah bears Jacob’s sons, she names them Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah. With each son’s birth, she hopes that Jacob will love her. But by the time Judah is born, she seems to relent and refocus her affections on her God, saying, “This time I will praise the LORD” (Genesis 29:35). \n\nBetween Leah and Rachel and their servant women Bilhah and Zilpah, Jacob had twelve sons. These twelve sons would go on to be the patriarchs of the twelve tribes of Israel, and from the tribe of Judah, Jesus would be born. This son of the unloved wife would lead to the birth of the Messiah, who would bear the weight of every broken relationship. \n\nThe sad twists of this story lead us to look forward to the cross, because it is the only lens that allows us to see the grief and sadness that come from broken relationships more clearly. And yet, the good news of Jesus doesn’t change what we feel when we are mistreated, deceived, or utterly distracted with envy. \n\nEach of those scenarios tears at our relationships with other people, inevitably causing us to see people as less than the image-bearers God created us to be. We wound and are wounded. People become objects, wrong sources of our happiness (like Rachel was to Jacob), transactional sources of labor and economic gain (like Jacob was to Laban), or they make us the victim of our own disordered desires (like Rachel did to Leah). \n\nBut Jesus takes all of that–every objectifying, victimizing, heartbreaking, manipulative, broken interaction–and instead, offers us perfect healing and a gospel-paved way to reconciliation. As we read on, Jacob will experience total reconciliation with his brother Esau. While not every relationship experiences that kind of healing in this life, as we seek to treat other people the way Jesus treats us, we can lean on the shared gift of the gospel to be the common ground of grace. It is all we have to offer. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI love this story. I think it’s because somehow I missed it growing up, and when I read it as an adult, it moved me to tears. I remember hearing the part of Jacob’s story from the end of Genesis 32, where he wrestles with God, but I’d never really heard his story from chapter 33—and this story has a happy ending. \n\nWe don’t actually get to say that very often about many stories in the Bible, and certainly not the stories in found in Genesis. In fact, every story about Jacob leading up to this one hasn’t necessarily been fun to read. Following Jacob’s narrative, we see that he chooses to collude with his mother in order to steal the birthright from his older brother Esau. He goes on to be deceived into marrying a woman he doesn’t love. And he is exploited by his father-in-law, Laban, forced into years of servitude. \n\nIn Genesis 31, Jacob begins to journey back to his home where he will meet his estranged brother, Esau. In stealing Esau’s birthright, Jacob wronged his brother terribly. And now, he brings his wives, children, and livestock on a journey to meet him again. He packs up a massive gift offering, trying to win Esau’s affections (or tolerance) with whatever he can give. \n\nHere’s the stunningly beautiful, perfect portrait of God’s free grace to us: Esau runs to Jacob, embraces him, and says “I have enough, my brother… Keep what you need” (Genesis 33:19). Esau’s reaction moves me to tears and makes me want to shout out in celebration—all at the same time—because this story is a picture of what God offers me. Their reconciliation is just a foretaste of our own reconciliation with our God: a redeemed relationship that we cannot buy, we cannot earn, and we cannot lose. I have wronged God. Apart from Christ, I was estranged from Him. Everything that Jacob did to Esau, I have done ten times over to everyone I know. \n\nI can imagine myself before Him. I’m trembling as I hold out my “good deeds” as an offering to Him, a way to make our relationship right, and He responds by telling me He not only has enough—He is enough. \n\nGod provided redemption through Jesus for His children, and His work on the cross is enough to cover every sin. Jesus secured the redemption of those who believe in Him. And the Holy Spirit seals us for the day of redemption, when we will live with God forever. Thanks be to God!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nAfter being married just three years, my husband and I moved away from the city I grew up in, all our friends, our families, and our church community. We left to attend graduate school in a state five hours away, which isn’t really that far, but in the post-move shock of everything being so painfully new, I struggled mightily.\n\nTwo years later, we moved again, closer to home in proximity and yet every day we felt further and further away from relationship. While we now had a baby, I still had no friends, which left me a particularly unhealthy combination of angry, sad, and lonely. In the end, we limped home in a moving truck with a baby who had just learned to crawl. And as I stood there in our new apartment, finally holding the keys in my hand, I wept. God had called us back to the place we had ached to be for so long. \n\nIn Genesis 35, God called Jacob home to Bethel, where He had first appeared to him. In Genesis 28, Jacob saw a stairway to God in a dream. And God made him this epic promise: “I will give you and your offspring the land on which you are lying… All the peoples on earth will be blessed through your offspring” (Genesis 28:13–14). In response, Jacob named the place Bethel, declaring, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it … What an awesome place this is! This is none other than the house of God. This is the gate of heaven” (vv.16–17). \n\nSo when God called Jacob back to Bethel after many years away, Jacob reacted immediately. First, he told his family to purge their homes of any idols to false gods, promising to build an altar to worship the God who had been there in his “day of distress” and “everywhere” he had since gone (Genesis 35:3). When Jacob returned to Bethel, God gave him the new name of “Israel” and promised that both nations and kings would descend from him (vv.10–11). Jacob would set up an Ebenezer, a stone marker to remember and celebrate the Lord’s faithfulness in all circumstances.\n\nIn his hymn “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing,” a twenty-two-year-old Robert Robinson declared:\n\nHere I raise my Ebenezer;  Hither by Thy help I’m come;  And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,  Safely to arrive at home.  Jesus sought me when a stranger,  Wandering from the fold of God;  He, to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood.\n\nBecause of Jesus, we can claim the same promise of an eternal home, the door opened for us by His person and work on the cross. And we can pray, thanking, celebrating, and remembering the promises He has made to us in His Word, and that ultimately, our forever home is with Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nThe ugliest moments of my life have been marked by jealousy. It is perhaps my most defining sin, and it masquerades as pride, fear, insecurity, and relationship-crushing meanness. Envy dehumanizes everyone around me; it removes their own agency as creative, talented, smart image-bearers of God. I no longer see them as their own persons, but rather as measuring sticks for my own worth. Too often, I think, I’m better than so-and-so at that, but nowhere near as good as that other person. If jealousy is my economy, cynicism and narcissism are the currency I trade. If that sounds harsh or out of proportion, it’s not. I think that jealousy and envy are the root of most conflicts between people, and unadmitted jealousy festers and slowly destroys relationships. \n\nEnvy is threaded through the Bible, a throughline of sin from Cain and Abel, Rachel and Leah, Saul and David, the pharisees who watched Jesus draw crowds to Himself, and more. In history, art, and literature, examples are rampant. In Shakespeare’s Othello, Iago cautions Othello about such envy: “Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy! It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on.”\n\nJoseph is the victim of his brothers’ jealousy, which robs him of his family, his home, his dignity, and almost his life. His brothers strip him of his robe and would have killed him, but sold him to a band of traders instead. It was perhaps the equivalent of death in their eyes: they expected to never see him again, and delivered the news of his death to their father Jacob. \n\nAs modern readers, we know how the story goes: Joseph trusts the Lord, and the Lord protects him. He rises to power in Egypt and eventually saves his family from famine and forgives his brothers. But the moment we read about today in Genesis 37 doesn’t have any of that goodness— only pain. And by not reading ahead, we can force ourselves to sit in the devastation wreaked by Joseph’s brothers. Jacob mourns the loss of his son and cannot be comforted. Joseph is sold again, this time to an Egyptian official. No longer in control, Joseph has lost all agency at the hands of his jealous brothers. \n\nThis is that same “green-eyed monster,” and throughout Scripture, we are warned against its fallout. Proverbs 14:30 cautions that “a tranquil heart is life to the body, but jealousy is rottenness to the bones.” Ecclesiastes 4:4 tells us that “all labor and all skillful work is due to one person’s jealousy of another. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.” And James 3:16 advises that “where there is envy and selfish ambition, there is disorder and every evil practice.” \n\nScripture certainly doesn’t hold back about the consequences of jealousy, and neither should we. As I read about Joseph’s story, I’m aware that I should “let it read me”: Where is my jealousy hurting people that I love? Where is it corroding my heart and sowing disorder? Where is it disordering my priorities away from Christ and toward my own selfish gain? These are important questions to ask because jealousy isn’t something to be taken lightly. My prayer is that I never will.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nGenesis 38 breaks into the Joseph narrative with a bold, complicated, very broken story. Joseph is sold into slavery, and the very next verse we read is about his brother Judah. Judah was one of Leah’s sons, and Leah the wife that Jacob didn’t love. Judah was also the patriarch of the lineage of King David and Jesus. So this story, and Judah’s legacy, isn’t as much an interjection as an interlude that gives us a glimpse of God’s grace and the amazing ways His promises were fulfilled despite all sorts of human interference. \n\nSome cultural background helps this story, because it’s a rather tangled web of relationships. Levirate marriage was a practice in the ancient Near East that was later codified in Deuteronomy 25 as part of the Mosaic law. Basically, it meant that if a man died before he had a child, his brother had to marry his wife, and their first child would carry on the first (dead) brother’s name and place in the lineage. \n\nJudah had three sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah. Er married a woman named Tamar, and Er was so evil that he died. Onan married Tamar, but didn’t want to preserve his brother’s place in the lineage, and so he did not impregnate Tamar, and was killed for that sin. Judah had seen both of his sons die after marrying Tamar, so he hid Shelah away and kept him from Tamar. \n\nTamar, the widow who had the right to bear Judah’s eldest son’s child and continue the family line, responded. She dressed as a prostitute, tempted Judah, and conceived a child with him without him knowing who she was (Genesis 38:13–19). Later, when Judah found out she was pregnant, he threatened to kill her for adultery (against Shelah, whom she was technically betrothed to). When she revealed that Judah was, in fact, the father, he then admitted that he had wronged her. Tamar had twin sons, Perez and Zerah, and Perez continued the family line and his descendants included King David and Jesus. \n\nThat is a lot of background to unpack a story that is, at its root, a story of God’s faithfulness to a family. God had made a promise to Abraham. He made a promise to Isaac and to Jacob. And at so many turns, the promise appears threatened by someone’s sin. Judah almost destroyed what he should never have had in the first place: the blessing of the line of Christ. \n\nBut the author of this very complicated story is the Author of the ultimate story: the story where God wins, where His promises all come true, and we are given the free gift of grace purchased on the cross by Jesus, the Son of God who came to earth as a baby in the line of Judah. God can and does redeem the hardest, most impossible, most complicated stories. What a gift it is to be His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nAt first glance, Joseph’s story reads like a set of extraordinary circumstances lived by an ordinary man. If that’s the case, it would be enough to hold our collective attention for a moment, but not one second more. So why is it we are still talking about him?\n\nJoseph was the favorite son of Jacob (Genesis 37:3). You may have heard of his coat of many colors, or perhaps the time his brothers sold him into slavery (vv.3, 27–28). Joseph stood firm against the temptations of Potiphar’s wife, even though doing so landed him in prison. (Genesis 39). He’s the one who relocated the baby nation of Israel to Egypt and protected them from eventual famine (Genesis 47). \n\nThese are the facts we see on the surface, but look again. There is an undercurrent to Joseph’s story that points to a deeper truth. We see it written all over Genesis 39. We read that the Lord “was with Joseph,” and when his master realized this, he also saw that “the LORD made everything he did successful” (vv.2–3). The Lord remained “with Joseph and extended kindness to him,” blessing “the Egyptian’s house” and making everything he did successful (vv. 5,21–23). It’s clear that while on a human level Joseph’s life was marked by betrayal, fear, and desperate circumstances, on the supernatural level, his story is about so much more—because of God’s favor. \n\nWhen Joseph’s brothers plotted his death— God preserved his life.\n\nWhen the schemes of man made Joseph a slave and a refugee—God gave him favor in a foreign land. \n\nWhen he was falsely accused and thrown in jail—God infused Joseph’s prison time with purpose. \n\nWhen there was no way for Joseph to free himself from his shackles—God set Him free. \n\nWhen Joseph was cut off from his family—God made a way for radical reconciliation. \n\nWhen Joseph lived in a land of famine—God filled his storehouses. \n\nJoseph was a nobody. Just an overlooked kid with a string of bad luck. Nothing to see here—but God. God was using the circumstances of Joseph’s life to tell a bigger, more important story: the story about His glory. \n\nGod’s story of grace is the undercurrent of our lives too. He proves His own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). He remains faithful to us, even when we are not (1 Corinthians 10:13). He is “rich in mercy, [and] because of his great love that he had for us, made us alive with Christ even though we were dead in trespasses. [We] are saved by grace!” (Ephesians 2:4–5). \n\nThe reality of God’s grace turns every moment of rejection, every false accusation or overlooked achievement, every fear and every famine, into an opportunity to showcase His glory. He is the point—not us. Thousands of years later, we are still compelled to remember the story of a shepherd boy turned slave, who was transformed from a prisoner into a man of great power—not by Joseph’s strength of character or accomplishment, but by God’s design and power. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nOf all the drama and intrigue contained in Genesis 41 and 42, these four words capture my attention the most: “after two whole years” (Genesis 41:1, ESV). Joseph sat in a foreign prison, innocent of the crimes he was accused of committing—for two whole years. That’s a long time to wait for your rescue, a long time to wonder if a savior is coming, a long time to pray for God to come through. Except, on God’s redemptive timeline, it isn’t. When God decided to restore Joseph, it happened in the blink of an eye: “Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit” (v.14). \n\nThough I know the stories in God’s Word aren’t about me, I can’t help but identify with Joseph. I’d go all in on the bet that you can identify with him too. Here we sit, longing for our rescue. We’ve got heartaches and breaks we want mended. We’ve got needs we cannot meet for ourselves. We’ve got broken bodies, broken homes, and broken cultures. There are times our fallen world feels like a prison. In Christ, we have been made new (2 Corinthians 5:17), but it doesn’t always feel like it. We are still waiting for complete deliverance from our brokenness, and we have been waiting our whole lives. And yet… “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet… the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:52).\n\nWhatever it is that you’re waiting for God to do, whether you’ve been waiting two years or two decades and even when the wait feels like it will last forever, there is hope worth holding on to. Someday, when Christ returns for His bride, we will exchange prisons for the fullness of His presence, pits for His perfect peace. \n\nThe wait often feels like it’s lasting too long—except, on God’s timeline, it isn’t. Watch for Jesus with hope that is rooted in expectation, knowing that the wait, no matter how long, will not have the last word.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by geodes. They’re unremarkable on the outside; to the untrained eye, they just look like rocks (often ugly ones). But crack a geode open and you’ll find your breath has been taken away. Each one is filled with a tiny city of crystals that shine and sparkle in a spectacular variety of colors and formations.\n\nThere are many geodes in Joseph’s story, moments that are unremarkable at first, even ugly. But as the Bible cracks each one open and all is revealed, our breath is taken away by the beauty God brings about in the midst of the ugly and unremarkable.\n\nOne geode is the silver Joseph snuck back into the sacks of his brothers. Genesis 42 records: “Joseph then gave orders to fill their containers with grain, return each man’s silver to his sack, and give them provisions for their journey. This order was carried out” (v.25). For Joseph, this was a moment of generosity. He opted to give blessings to the brothers who had taken so much from him. But to the brothers, who could not scrub the blood of their brother from their hearts and hands, the money was a curse, highlighting their sin and guilt. \n\nThere are both blessings and perceived curses in our lives. We think we can distinguish the difference between the two. Blessings look and feel good. Situations that seem to be cursed, in our limited, human perspective, do not. But what if blessings and burdens are in cahoots? What if God can use the seemingly unremarkable and ugly parts of our lives to reveal His goodness and provision?\n\nWhen the famine forced his brothers to return to Egypt a second time to purchase grain for their hungry families, it was the silver in their sacks that brought them back to Joseph. Without money to return, surely they would have avoided the foreign ruler who imprisoned them, kept their brother Simeon, and ordered them to bring him their beloved baby brother. But once the geode was cracked open, deep beauty was revealed. \n\n“Then the steward said, ‘May you be well. Don’t be afraid.  Your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your bags.  I received your silver.’ Then he brought Simeon out to them” (Genesis 43:23). \n\nThey returned the silver, and brought their brother Benjamin to Joseph, and Simeon was returned to them. But look again. Standing in their brother’s presence, reconciliation was possible. The family was reunited and brought together to live in the thriving nation of Egypt.\n\nLook again. Crack open another geode. The events of Joseph’s story set the stage for Israel’s later enslavement by a new Pharaoh. That moment of history is ugly, but look at how God continues to work. Israel’s deliverance through Moses, the Passover, and the parting of the Red Sea. Keep looking. Keep cracking. From the nation of Israel came our Savior whose birth seemed unremarkable and death was horrific, but whose sacrifice granted us salvation—the greatest treasure of all. \n\nThere is no way to know the riches God can bring in the ugly, rocky places of our lives. We can trust the treasure is there and that in His timing, beautiful, sparkling gems will be revealed.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Jacob Comes to Egypt",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nSometimes the language of Scripture is so tender, I’m tempted to look away. We find such a moment in Genesis 48. When Jacob sent his favorite son on a simple errand to check the family pasture, that son, Joseph, was barely out of boyhood. Scripture tells us he was just seventeen years old (Genesis 37:2). But Joseph never came home. Jacob believed the story his other sons told him, that his favorite boy was dead. He must have mentally buried all of his hopes for Joseph’s future. \n\nIn the unbelievable providence of God, Jacob was reunited with his boy. But Joseph wasn’t a teenager anymore. The son Israel lost now had sons of his own, and Israel’s hopes for his boy were suddenly resurrected. You can almost hear the wonder and surprise in his voice when he looked at his grandsons for the first time and asked, “Who are these?” (Genesis 48:8).\n\nIsrael wasted no time on icebreakers. Seeing your children taken and returned has a way of cutting through the trivial. “Bring them to me and I will bless them,” he said (v.9). Scripture describes Jacob as a tired old man, with eyes that didn’t work like they used to (v.11), but he had seen enough in his life to know to hold his blessings close. Knowing this, these words in particular from this interaction put a lump in my throat: \n\n“Then Joseph took them from his father’s knees and bowed with his face to the ground… then [Jacob] blessed Joseph and said…  ‘the angel who has redeemed me from all harm— may he bless these boys’” (vv.12,15–16). \n\nThe image of Ephraim and Manassah sitting on their grandfather’s knee pulls every string in my heart. There’s such tenderness in this moment. Such precious, paternal prayer. The words of blessing Jacob spoke over his grandsons weren’t grandiose. Though Jacob wrestled with God to secure his own blessing (Genesis 32:22–32), for the next generation, he sweetly whispered “bless these boys.” It was a prayer God certainly answered—a prayer God is answering still. \n\nYou don’t have to strongarm God to get Him to listen. Brute force is not the secret to praying with power. Lift your babies onto your knee. Grab a friend. Pull her close. Simply ask God to bless the ones you love. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nAt the end of the day, and the end of our lives, we all want to be carried home. \n\nIsrael experienced the dysfunction and joy of family (Genesis 28 and 29), life and death (Genesis 29–30, 35:18), abundance and famine (Genesis 30 and 42). He wrestled with God and walked with Him. \n\nThere is typography to all of our lives, highs and lows, peaks and valleys, times when God’s blessings flow like roaring rivers, and times when they seem like a barely trickling brook. Each individual moment, experience, or circumstance is just a snapshot; only God has the 10,000 foot view. And at every elevation, He is wooing us back toward home. \n\nThough Israel met the love of his life and experienced smashing success in Haran, he never stopped thinking about Canaan. Though his children and grandchildren put down deep roots in Egypt, he never shook the pull of home. After calling them to himself to offer one final blessing over each of them, he gave instructions for his own burial—not in Egypt, where Joseph was interred, but with his forefathers, in the cave found in a field, in the land of Canaan (Genesis 49:29–30). He told them: “This is the field Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hethite as burial property. Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried there, Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried there, and I buried Leah there’” (Genesis 49:29–31). Israel wanted to rest with his people.\n\nWhether we are in a moment of success or failure, whether we find ourselves deeply rooted or adrift, whether in the highest of highs or the lowest of lows—our hearts ache for our true and future home. There is a longing, placed deep inside of each one of us, not for the land of our fathers, but the land of the Father. We know, deep down in our guts, that eternity with Him is where we belong. \n\nIsrael’s ache exists in each one of us. Like him, we want to know that we won’t have to stay forever in this foreign, broken land. In every peak and every valley, we can cling to this hope: in Christ, our homesickness will be satisfied. Someday soon—it won’t be long now—we, too, will be carried home. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Joshua 1:1-18, Deuteronomy 31:1-6, Psalm 1:1-3\n\nLike any reasonable person, I put no stock in fortune cookies. Still, I usually crack one open once I’m overfull from a generous plate of sesame chicken and rice. Despite my satisfied appetite, I nibble on a bite of the sweet shell while reading the words printed on the tiny slip of paper inside.\n\nI’m not sure why I have trouble resisting that treat at the bottom of my takeout bag. Maybe it’s my love of sugar, but I think it’s something more. In a world that seems to grow more uncertain by the day, we want a sure thing. We want to know what’s coming, what’s not, what’s next. We know a fortune cookie isn’t going to change our circumstances, but it’s fun to pretend, just for a moment, that it might.\n\nWhen the book of Joshua opens, the Israelites have come to the end of one long, unpredictable journey. Unpredictable as far as the humans involved are concerned, that is. The Lord—God Almighty, the Holy One—has been with His people each step of the way. He has never left them, never forsaken them, never taken back His covenant even when they gave Him a million sinful reasons to do so. And here, as Israel stands on the edge of the last leg of their journey to the Promised Land, He promises that His faithfulness will continue.\n\nListen to these phrases of certainty offered by both God and His newly appointed servant, Joshua, over the span of just 18 verses (emphasis mine):\n\n“I am giving [this land to the Israelites]” (v. 2).\n\n“I have given you [every place your foot touches]” (v. 3).\n\n“Your territory will be [where I’ve appointed it]” (v. 4).\n\n“I will be with you” (v. 5).\n\n“I will not leave you or forsake you” (v. 5).\n\n“You will distribute the land I swore to their fathers” (v. 6).\n\n“You will have success” [as you heed all of My instruction] (v. 7).\n\n“You will prosper and succeed” [when you observe My Word] (v. 8).\n\n“God is with you wherever you go” (v. 9).\n\n“You will be crossing the Jordan” (v. 11).\n\n“God is giving” [this land to you] (v. 11).\n\n“God will give you rest” (v. 13).\n\n“God will give you this land” (v. 13).\n\nAs profoundly complex as the situation seemed, it was also profoundly simple: God was keeping His promise, just like He always had and just like He always will.\n\nIsrael got the message, and they responded in kind: \n\n“Everything you have commanded us we will do, and everywhere you send us we will go. We will obey you, just as we obeyed Moses in everything” (v. 16-17, emphasis mine).\n\nIf you’ve read ahead, you know how this story ends. The God of Israel was completely faithful to His people. They did cross the Jordan, and they did take possession of the land He’d promised their ancestor Abraham 450 years earlier. You may also know that Israel did not hold to the “everything” and “everywhere” they’d promised. Yes, they followed Joshua. They heeded his instructions to prepare, to remember, to go (v. 11-13), but their faithfulness was only partial. Like a sieve, obedience slipped through the holes in their good intentions.\n\nTheir faith was not perfect, but God’s Word and faithfulness did not falter. \n\nThis Bible we open together today makes some bold promises. These are not fortune-cookie promises to be read one moment and tossed into the takeout bag the next. These are holy promises. These are true promises (Psalm 19:7). \n\nWhen we believe on Jesus Christ, we will be saved (Romans 10:9).\n\nThrough the gift of His Holy Spirit, Christ will never leave us (Matthew 28:20).\n\nBy His death and resurrection, Jesus has taken on our sin and granted us His righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21).\n\nWhen God says “I will” and “I have,” He will and He has. \n\nPraise the Lord, His faithfulness fills in the cracks of our obedience! Praise the Lord, we can walk with courage and confidence into the certainty of a tomorrow where God will never leave us or forsake us. Praise the Lord that as co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17), every foot forward is another step on the journey of coming home to a place we’ve never been. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Joshua 2:1-24, Joshua 3:1-17, Numbers 13:25-33, Hebrews 11:31\n\nWe’re in that phase of family where at least one, if not all three, of our children end up in our bed by the time the sun comes up. At some point in the night one of the little people in our home will inevitably wake. Rather than rolling over and going back to sleep, he or she will stand up, drag his or her sleepy self down the stairs, round the corner into our room, and climb into our bed, right between my husband and me.\n\nOther than the growing amount of room they take up in our comfy bed, there’s something else I’ve noticed about this nightly ritual. Our comfort-seeking kiddos always crawl in our bed and lie down facing their papa, every single time. Whether the culprit is a bad dream in their heads or a raging storm outside the window, their response is the same: they face their father.\n\nI love the juxtaposition of the stories we find in chapters 2 and 3 of Joshua. Two very different stories of God’s children choosing to face and follow their holy heavenly Father in the face of impossible circumstances. And in both situations, He proves Himself worthy of their unabashed trust and holy fear.\n\nRahab, a woman known primarily by her sin, met the one true God in a precarious time in the history of her homeland. She’d heard the stories of God’s stunning faithfulness to His people, and she knew they were coming to possess the land. Her neighbors were frightened by the evidence of His greatness; in Rahab’s own words, they were panicked (Joshua 2:9). But a different kind of fear was taking root in Rahab. She was coming to fear the Lord.\n\nBelieving the God of Israel was “God in heaven above and on earth below” (Joshua 2:11), Rahab risked everything to offer refuge to the two spies sent by Joshua into Jericho. In a culture of faithlessness, she dared to face full-on the holiness of God and follow Him in a bold act of faith. Later, her family would be spared because of it (Joshua 6:17).\n\nIsrael had seen God’s rescue not from afar but up close. When Joshua said to them, “The Lord will do wonders among you tomorrow,” they knew he meant it (Joshua 3:5). So Israel faced the ark of the covenant, which symbolized the very presence of the Lord (Joshua 3:10-11), and moved forward to take possession of the “land flowing with milk and honey” (Numbers 13:27). Even following the ark among the masses required faith. Surely the people remembered the time the scouts reported back to Moses, Aaron, and all of Israel that the promised land was inhabited by a people impossible to defeat. “They are stronger than we are!” the scouts cried out (Numbers 13:31). But they were not stronger than Israel’s God.\n\nIsn’t this what it’s like to follow the Almighty Lord? Sometimes, like Rahab, you walk the road alone, stepping out on nothing but faith and a holy fear of the God who rescues His people. Sometimes you move with the masses, direction clear as day, but a nagging doubt nonetheless. What if we aren’t strong enough? What if we’re defeated? Then the God of the impossible dries up a riverbed for your feet to walk across, just as He did when your wilderness journey began (Joshua 3:17; Exodus 14:22). \n\nFrom impossible to impossible, the road of faith is under the command of our sovereign God, beginning to end. A people with an impossible future and a harlot with an impossible past—both fixed their eyes on the only true God and neither were beyond the reach of His rescue.\n\nNo situation is beyond the sovereignty and strength of our God. He is the God of Abraham, of Moses, of Joshua, of Rahab. He is the same—yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8). Fear Him in His awesome glory. Face Him in His limitless compassion. Follow Him wherever He leads, no matter the scene to your right or left. Fix your eyes on His presence and His promises.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Joshua 4:1-24, Joshua 5:1-15, Exodus 25:10-22\n\nI think I have a super-nose. It has twice identified dangerous fires in the nick of time, once diagnosed an ear infection in a baby, and can always sense any change in my husband’s morning ablutions. The poor man can’t wash his face with a different soap without my nose sensing the difference. I’ve learned never to ignore a smell because scents yield up so much valuable information.\n\nOur sense of smell also delivers when it comes to evoking memories. I learned to depend on smell when I was still young, so when I found myself in a moment that I wanted to impress on my memory forever, I used a scent to anchor it. Over time, I amassed a rolodex of lotions and perfumes that I used as markers for memory; I needed only to breathe in the scent to remind me of those treasured days. The smell of lime conjures up the peak of the Kahlenberg looking over the Danube River, and the smell of strawberry reminds me of our first apartment.\n\nPurposeful, intentional memory building is not my own clever invention; God used markers in the Old and New Testaments to memorialize significant moments in the lives of His covenant people. Just like the Israelites, we are “forgetful hearers” and we need help remembering God’s past faithfulness and His future promises (James 1:25).\n\nIsrael had both God’s promises and His faithfulness to remember, and their escape from Egypt was bookended by two unbelievable river crossings: the Red Sea and the Jordan River. God taught them to remember by establishing an equally unbelievable monument. He commanded twelve men to heave giant river stones out of the muddy riverbed on their shoulders and carry them to shore. They muscled these stones into an heavy pile. As the slimy green algae dried on the rocks, they stood back, wiping their hands, to look at what they had done, and saw an impossible, otherworldly monument. These were rocks from the very bottom of the Jordan River. They never should have been seen, and yet, because God miraculously stopped the river, they were stacked on the shore as a reminder of God’s impossible miracle for generations.\n\nThis unlikely mound of river rocks was a testament and a signal that this was the end of an era. No more would they be wilderness wanderers; they had finally come home. “And the day after they ate from the produce of the land, the manna ceased. Since there was no more manna for the Israelites, they ate from the crops of the land of Canaan that year” (Joshua 5:12). God underscored the end of their travels by putting a stop to the manna. They could set up homes, and grow their own food on their own land.\n\nAs they settled in to this wonderful home they had never known before, it would have been easy to forget how they got there. Their legendary victories were only achieved when they walked in obedience, and their devastating failures were a direct result of failing to obey God. The people of Israel were inclined to forget the source of their help, and we lean right with them in that same direction.\n\nEven as we set up memorials, using the power of sight and smell and our other senses to remember our lives, Joshua drives us to remember those old and sure memorials of God’s faithfulness. Israel’s epic victories were not undergirded by their own doing, but by God’s faithfulness to His promises. \n\n“In the future, when your children ask their fathers, ‘What is the meaning of these stones?’ you should tell your children, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’ For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over. This is so that all the people of the earth may know that the Lord’s hand is mighty, and so that you may always fear the Lord your God.”\n-Joshua 4:21-24\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Joshua 6:1-27, 1 Kings 16:34, Colossians 2:11-12, Exodus 3:1-6\n\nMost people move into a retirement community later in life, but I’ve been a part of one since birth. My dad has always been in the business of caring for the elderly, and as a result, I’ve gained some serious benefits—mainly, a personal cheering squad. They are always up for a competitive card game or impromptu ice cream cone, and never forget to tell me how tall I’ve gotten. And boy, do these people know how to throw parties. I’ll never forget the Bon Voyage party we had for the chapel. \n\nYou see, the community was going through a huge, exciting expansion—new office buildings and homes going up left and right. There was just one problem standing, quite literally, in the way of those new plans: the community’s beloved chapel, the centerpiece of the campus. Instead of letting the bulldozer run its course, the community decided to uproot the chapel from its original location and transfer it to the other side of the property. There, it could continue to be enjoyed for years to come. \n\nThe day of the move, my parents let me miss a few hours of the second grade to witness it. We stood under the porte-cochere, eating cream cheese bagels while the community band warmed their bagpipes and trumpets. Surrounded by dirt piles and construction hats, it was hard to miss the shocking upheaval of the chapel’s uprooted foundation. Still, there was much to celebrate. The chapel itself, the very place where this community had regularly recounted God’s faithfulness, remained safe and sound. \n\nIn our reading today, we’re entering a different construction site together, one filled with its own upheavals and unknowns. The broad-shouldered city of Jericho is fearfully closed to the Israelites—no one goes out, no one comes in. Under the Lord’s direction, a curse is imposed on the city and its idol-loving inhabitants when Joshua and the priests begin to march around it. Carrying the ark of the covenant, they keep in step with God’s commands and watch as the walls around Jericho fall at their feet. \n\n“The people advanced into the city, each man straight ahead, and they captured the city. They completely destroyed everything in the city with the sword—every man and woman, both young and old, and every ox, sheep, and donkey.”\n- Joshua 6:20-21\n\nGod gave them the city. \n\nNow, I don’t know about you, but I’m not sure how I’m supposed to feel about this. Yes, justice was served. Yes, the good guys prevailed. And yes, God’s perfect plan unfurled as He’d promised. But that doesn’t change the fact that they were standing in a destruction zone, does it?\n\nSitting with the truth of crumbled walls and a city destroyed, I cannot help but wonder what this says about God. We readily cozy up to God’s promises of love, restoration, and peace, but what do we do when His promises include curses, death, and brokenness? \n\nWe trust Him still. From where we sit, it’s hard to understand the mind and ways of God (Isaiah 55:8-9). But the just consequences of sin do not lessen the sovereign goodness of our God.\n\nAt the intersection of God’s wrath and mercy, we find two constants: His kept promises and His unfailing love. To trust the fullness of His character, we need Him to be steady and sure. In chapter 6 we encounter God’s faithfulness, not only in the midst of a crumbling Jericho, but also in the protection of Rahab, who became part of the lineage of Christ (Matthew 1:5). \n\nBecause of who He is, we can always stare into the dark unknown of destruction to find an unchanging God. In the midst of every upheaval and replanting, He is faithful.\n\nPraise the Lord for every promise kept. \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nText: Joshua 7:1-26, Joshua 8:1-35, Deuteronomy 9:26-29\n\nWho of us has not lamented like Joshua, beating our breasts and rending our garments, surveying the landscape of darkness, rebellion, and fear in front of us? Many of us have fretted that God’s name will not be made great, but all too often we say, “What can we do to make Your name great?” Joshua, praise God, got the pronoun right: “What will You do for your own great name?” (Joshua 7:9, emphasis mine).\n\nIt’s strange, the knots we tie ourselves up in, the puzzles we struggle to fit ourselves into, the efforts we put forth to be the bringers of greatness to God. We want to be the world changers and the history makers, the people of God for God, with nothing standing in our way. But Joshua, in the face of Israel’s abundant sin, knew if God’s name was to be great, He Himself would be the one to do it—not man. \n\nWe think the world will be changed by our short-term missionary journeys, fiery sermons, and quippy books. We think we can bring glory to God’s name with our efforts of authenticity, by racking up social media “likes” and “followers,” by planting new churches, both big and small. We think we’ll glorify Him by performing awesome acts in His name and creating large gatherings for prayer and praise—by centering most things on the gospel, and relying on great graphics to take care of the rest. \n\nBut in Joshua chapter 7, here is how God chose to make His name great: \n\nJoshua lines up the twelve tribes.\nWithin those tribes, the clans.\nWithin those clans, the households.\nWithin those households, the men.\nThen one man: Achen.\n\nTo him, Joshua says, “My son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make a confession to Him. I urge you, tell me what you have done. Don’t hide anything from me” (v. 19).\n\nAnd here, among an entire nation, Achen is found out and then tells the truth: “I have stolen and I have hidden what I have stolen, and here is where it is” (vv. 20-21, my paraphrase).\n\nBut God already knew Achen and his actions. He knows ours, too. \n\nWhat if the way God chooses to make His name great is the difficult, relentless, painful, and excruciatingly long process of unearthing sin in our lives? What if the way God makes His name great is not through public acts of piety, but private acts of repentance? What if His greatest act of glory is in exposing the darkest of lies our hearts have clung to, only to replace them with the light of His mercy and Truth? \n\nAs Charles Spurgeon said, “It is far easier to fight with sin in public, than to pray against it in private.”\n\nToday, as you read this passage, do not ask how you can do great things for God. Instead, ask Him to unearth the secret sins in your heart, the places that need exposure to His light and healing in His presence. He knows them already and loves you still.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Joshua 9:1-27, Joshua 10:1-15, Ephesians 1:18-23\n\nNothing makes me hustle like a deadline. Seriously, mention one in conversation and I’ll be unable to hear you over the clock that starts ticking in my head. \n\nIn college, I worked for the school newspaper. The building was underground, beneath the university’s basketball court, filled with the sounds of screeching sneakers and jammed printers. Sleep was replaced by a steady stream of caffeine and adrenaline, while stories forcefully flowed out of our fingers to be placed in the hands of our readers a few short hours later. \n\nWe basked in the knowledge that news couldn’t become news without us. Everything was under our watch, from the latest rumors to the biggest announcements. The fluorescent hallway beams created a false sense of time, as we hibernated under the security of to-do lists and grammar rules. In the morning, we’d climb the stairs of reality, the latest issue in hand, to welcome the day. Before opening the door, we’d make bets on whether the sky would be dark or light, because we honestly couldn’t tell the difference from our journalism bunker. \n\nIn chapter 10, Joshua faces a firm deadline with a pretty serious agenda: save his people from the attack of five powerful kings. It’s a bleak situation until the Lord says, “Do not be afraid of them, for I have handed them over to you. Not one of them will be able to stand against you” (v. 8).\n\nIf God were to assign a project and a deadline to me, I imagine I’d descend the the stairs to the newspaper office and begin strategizing my next move, emerging with a plan in the morning. But that’s not what Joshua does. \n\nJoshua asks God to make the sun stand still, giving him time to fulfill the mission at once. And God does it. The sun stops in the middle of the sky, delaying its setting almost a full day and giving Joshua the time needed to accomplish His task. \n\nAs I think about what a sight this must’ve been, I can’t help but realize that, if it were me, I’d still be underground, oblivious to the stilled sun. Even worse than missing that newsworthy spectacle, I’d miss out on observing the intimate care of my Creator. \n\nWhile I no longer work for the newspaper and now spend most of my time above ground, I haven’t completely graduated from my own knee-deep ambition. I collect my cares and hide away from the very God who fought for Israel! But I don’t want to spend my days strategizing. I want to get busy living like God has called me to live. \n\nMay we ask the Lord for a faith like Joshua’s, boldly believing that God is in our corner. Let us stand and walk and live in the sunlight, knowing He is for us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Joshua 10:16-43, Joshua 11:1-23, Psalm 110:1-7, Ephesians 1:3-14\n\nI only watch action movies for the romance. You know, the love subplot, where the guy-and-girl tale is interspersed between all the scenes of war and gore. Battles don’t interest me, nor do bomb explosions, car chases, guns, or swords. No matter the era or context of the film, something in my brain shuts off when the action picks up, and then that something turns back on to watch love rise from the rubble.\n\nWhen reading Joshua, I find myself doing much the same thing. I’m tempted to glaze over the battle scenes, the names of the countries conquered, and all those kings’ names I can’t pronounce. Until I get to the “good stuff,” I tune out, then tune back in once I get to… well, Psalms.\n\nBut something interesting happened as I was reading over this week’s passage. At first, I only saw scenes of conquest, of Israel taking each and every enemy in its path—Makkedah, Libnah, Lachish—a slew of battle scenes depicting how God’s people took over the north and south territory of Canaan. However, as I read the passage again, I began to see that, in the midst of all the action, another plot emerges.\n\nThese verses are more than a retelling of conquest and victory. We see this when we pay attention to the repetitive language in the text—language that emphasizes God’s devotion to Israel:\n\n“And the Lord also delivered [Libnah] and its king into the hands of Israel” (Joshua 10:30).\n\n“And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hands of Israel” (Joshua 10:32).\n\n“Do not be afraid…I will deliver all of them” (Joshua 11:6).\n\n“And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel” (Joshua 11:8).\n\nSimilarly, repetitive language is used to describe Joshua’s devotion to God’s command:\n\n“So Joshua conquered all the land… as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him” (Joshua 10:40).\n\n“So Joshua did to them as the Lord had told him” (Joshua 11:9).\n\n“He utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded” (Joshua 11:12).\n\n“As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that the Lord had commanded Moses” (Joshua 11:15).\n\nAs the dust settles on the battlefield, look for it: the making and fulfillment of a promise. Devotion, obedience, and a commitment to one another, at all costs. In the midst of the struggle and the fear is this command: “Do not be afraid” (Joshua 10:25).\n\nIt sounds like a love story, doesn’t it? The love of God for His people—a love that spans much further than the physical territory Joshua conquered. It’s a love that would eventually come down in human form to save not only Israel from their enemies, but also you and me from a fate we surely deserved: “We have redemption in Him through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding” (Ephesians 1:7-8).\n\nI no longer want to turn my head from the battle scenes of Joshua. I see my own redemptive story in there now, woven in and out with the assurance of deliverance and of promises fulfilled. Victory is found in Christ alone. This is the greatest love story we will ever know.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: Joshua 12:1-24, Deuteronomy 29:7-8, Nehemiah 9:22, Psalm 136:16-21\n\nI’m not sure what prompted the woman in seat 4B to share such intimate details of her life. Her husband, a pastor, had been kidnapped and killed just eighteen months earlier. Dabbing her eyes with a tissue, she quietly described to me the sorrow her family had endured.\n\nMy mind struggled to comprehend her pain. Honestly, I wanted to race back to the airplane lavatory and bolt the door against the suffering that was so palpable in the seat next to mine. Instead, I managed to get this sentence past the lump in my throat:\n\n“Are God’s promises true?”\n\nThis was a woman who knew Christ and yet had truly suffered. I wanted to know—I needed to know—if God even climbed into valleys as dark and deep as this to keep His promises to His people. The woman’s response?\n\n“Every single one of them.” \n\nThis sweet stranger had come face to face with darkness and found that Jesus truly is the Light of the World (John 8:12). \n\nShe had walked through the Valley of the Shadow of Death and discovered Jesus is the resurrection and the life (Psalm 23:4; John 11:25). \n\nShe had buried her treasure but found that the treasure of God’s presence had remained (Matthew 13:44). \n\nGod’s faithfulness in her life helped me remember His faithfulness in my own. When circumstances cause my anxious heart to question if God’s promises are really true, I need look no further than my own life to remind myself of His faithfulness. \n\nThis is what we find God’s people doing in Joshua 12. They had seen the walls of Jericho come a-tumbling down (Joshua 6), then watched as the Lord stopped the sun in its track for an entire day and rained hailstones down on their enemies (Joshua 10). God had kept His promises to defeat Israel’s enemies and clear the path for them to enter into the promised land. But there were still many battles left to fight, “still very large areas of land to be taken over” (Joshua 13:1). \n\nI so often see myself in the stories of God’s people as they wandered. Like me, they were a wimpy-hearted bunch, prone to discouragement, defeat, and despair. Despite God’s unbroken track record, their confidence was easily shaken. \n\nSo here, in Joshua 12, we find a roll call of the kept promises of God: a list of the kings God’s people had conquered, the lands they’d captured. Each one is proof of God’s love and provision:\n\nThe king of Jericho, one.\nThe king of Ai, one.\nThe king of Jerusalem, one.\nThe king of Hebron, one…\n\nFor 31 kings, the list goes on. Over and over, God came through. There’s not a single example of Him dropping the ball. It was God’s track record, not their own, that emboldened God’s people to keep fighting, to keep walking toward the land they’d been promised. \n\nIt’s hard for fickle folks like us to fully grasp, but God is the promise keeper. Failing to come through is not in His nature. His faithfulness gives us the courage to keep moving forward, pressing on toward the prize (Philippians 3:13-14). And as we march toward the promised land, we can rest assured that He will keep His promises still. \n\nEvery. Single. One. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Joshua 13:1-33, Joshua 14:1-15, 2 Peter 3:13, Romans 4:13-17\n\nI grew up on old church hymns. I have vivid memories of me as a child and then a teenager, turning a purple hardcover hymnal to the page number specified in the bulletin. Sunday mornings and Sunday nights, donning a dress or jeans, I’d stand up straight in the pew and sing loud the songs that would become the sounds of my faith—my confession in a melody of sharps and flats (sung mostly on key).\n\nWhen I read the conquest and land allotment passages in Joshua, I find myself humming “Victory in Jesus” and remembering the pages of that hymnal. It’s a boisterous hymn—at least, our rendition was. The combination of the pounding piano chords and reverberating notes from the pipe organ made me lift my head a little higher and belt out Eugene Bartlett’s chorus a little louder. \n\nO victory in Jesus,\nMy Savior, forever.\nHe sought me and bought me\nWith His redeeming blood;\nHe loved me ere I knew Him\nAnd all my love is due Him,\nHe plunged me to victory,\nBeneath the cleansing flood.\n\nIt felt, well, victorious. The irony is that the actions expressed in these lyrics sound less like conquest and more like surrender. Being “sought” and “bought” and “plunged” into a flood is not congruent with my idea of winning. But in the gospel of Jesus, that’s exactly what it is. To be conquered by the grace of God is to be victorious.\n\nThe list of land divisions in Joshua 13 is more than just a test of our Old Testament pronunciation skills (a test I would fail with flying colors); it is a testimony to the precise, complete, and gracious fulfillment of God’s promise to Israel. Like every other promise God makes to His children, the boundaries described for each tribe were both fixed and fulfilled by God.  \n\nBut there’s even more to see here than the staggering detail with which the book describes the physical, promised land God gave Israel. Notice the phrasing used throughout chapters 13 and 14 for each portion of land. This land is their inheritance. It is a gift from the Lord, not based on merit but on identity. \n\nThe Israelites gained the land through conquest, but only with the one true God at the helm. Joshua’s people took the land, but only with the Lord of lords supplying the strength. This promised land was fulfilled because God secured it long ago as an inheritance for His children. The same is true of our eternal inheritance—our salvation.\n\nClifford in Shakespeare’s Henry VI declares, “God on our side, doubt not of victory!” And he was right. But this victory does not always look like we think it should. To be victorious in the Lord is to surrender what little might we have to the almighty One. To “win for Jesus” means losing ourselves in the flood of His forgiveness and grace.  \n\nWe are His children, His people, and He has granted us His very identity, sealed for us in Christ (Galatians 3:29). The new heavens and new earth are not yet ours to inhabit, but according to 2 Peter 3:13, the promise is ours now. The victory has been secured and the allotment has been assigned. \n\nYou and I don’t yet dwell in the new heavens with Christ. This fallen world we’re living in will never have the permanent “rest from war” we’ll enjoy in the new earth (Joshua 14:15). But Jesus dwells here with us—through the already-fulfilled promise of His Holy Spirit (John 14:26). “He is the down payment of our inheritance, for the redemption of the possession, to the praise of His glory” (Ephesians 1:14).\n\nThanks be to the Almighty God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Carolyn Denny\n\nText: Joshua 15:1-63, Joshua 16:1-10, 1 Peter 1:3-5, John 10:7-18\n\nGrowing up, Judah’s prospects looked pretty dim. Dysfunction? His family had it in spades. With all that family drama, it’s no wonder Judah ran away. Nor is it surprising that his problems continued to follow him. \n\nAfter marrying and having three sons of his own, the generational sin and chaos just perpetuated. Scripture tells us the first two were wicked and died young. The remaining son refused to care for his brother’s widow, Tamar; and while Judah was also responsible for her welfare, he refused to act on her behalf (Genesis 38:6-11). Eventually, Tamar used deceit to force his hand. Would Judah honor his responsibilities or run from them once again?\n\nWhen we look at Judah’s background, the answer seems obvious: Judah is not one of the “good guys.” He comes from one sinful mess and jumps right into another. Isn’t his course already set?\n\nThank God, the answer to that question is a resounding NO. Redemption is a constant refrain in the Bible: Your past does not define you (see Rahab). Your sin does not define you (see King David). Your family does not define you (see Ruth). Because of God’s love and mercy, Jesus Christ defines you. He calls you by name, and you are His (Isaiah 43:1). He alone created us, loves us perfectly, and saves us from our sin.\n\nJudah was not doomed by his past any more than you or me. God had great plans for him—plans to open his eyes to his own sinfulness (Genesis 38:26), plans to give him a new heart that could love well (Ezekiel 36:26), and even plans to reconcile his family and turn it into a great nation (Genesis 12:2). \n\nTamar’s trap became the turning point in Judah’s life. After he chose to take care of her, Judah returned to his father’s household, but this time as a sacrificial leader. By the time Judah received a final word from his father, it was a prophetic blessing: the future for his descendants would be long and bright (Genesis 49:10). This is the blessing we see unfolding in Joshua 15. Judah had become a tribe numbering in the thousands, and that tribe had arrived at the promised land to receive its inheritance.\n\nIn Ephesians, Paul wrote that God “is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us” (Ephesians 3:20). Do we really believe that? Or do we think it’s too late for us? Deep down, have we believed the lie that there are places God’s redemptive grasp can’t reach? \n\nWhen you feel stuck in dysfunction, or hounded by your past, remember Who defined Judah and his future. The tribe of Judah brought forth Jesus Christ, the “Lion of Judah” and the anchor of our true identity (John 1:12-13). He has an eternal inheritance for us beyond what we can imagine.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Joshua 17:1-18, Joshua 18:1-28, Hebrews 9:1-14\n\nAs much as I love traveling, there is nothing like coming home. Sleeping in my own bed, waking up to my own coffeemaker, hearing the familiar hum of traffic outside my window—home is truly a restful reprieve.\n\nIn Joshua chapter 18, we see a new home established for the nation of Israel at Shiloh: “Now the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of meeting there. And the land was subdued before them” (Joshua 18:1).\n\nThe tabernacle was the physical manifestation of God’s presence among His people. He dwelled in the innermost part of it, the holy of holies. In the midst of dividing territory and separating themselves physically from one another, it’s significant that the Israelites—all of the Israelites—now gathered in this one place to be in the presence of the Lord. God was the center, the core, of this people. And Shiloh would be His resting place for the next 300 years, until the Israelites were defeated by the Philistines.\n\nWhen I looked up “Shiloh” in Hebrew, I came across a couple of definitions. One was “a place of rest” and the other, “peace.”\n\nI don’t know that we can fully understand how the Israelites must have felt to finally settle and put down roots after years and years of traveling as nomads. An entire generation had been born and raised on foot, a generation that didn’t know what it meant to have a home—to have something to return to, a place to rest.\n\nThis is something we all understand: to have wandered far and long, to be weary and tired and thirsty, to desire peace—real peace. We all desire a place to call home.\n\nWhat this scene at Shiloh points us to is the place we, as Christians, now find our rest. “But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands. Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption” (Hebrews 9:11-12).\n\nThe atonement for our sin that was once achieved through sacrifice and ritual in the tabernacle, is now complete through Christ’s blood. He entered the Most Holy Place once, and for all. For me and for you. \n\nJesus is our Shiloh.\n\nAre you weary? “Come to Me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28).\n\nAre you thirsty? “Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty again” (John 4:14).\n\nAre you hungry? “I am the bread of life… No one who comes to Me will ever be hungry” (John 6:35).\n\nAre you restless? “Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7).\n\nIn Christ, we have rest and reprieve. In Christ, we have a home.\nLet us gather at Shiloh today and rest in that truth.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nText: Joshua 19:1-51, Genesis 49:1-28, Acts 13:16-25\n\nI was 10 or 11 years old when I first read Little Women. In the years before I opened that book, I thought reading and writing were “school” activities. I wrote stories because my teacher required it, not because I actually liked it. But Louisa May Alcott changed all that. She awakened something inside me, and I wanted in. So I pulled a blank notebook out of my desk, and I scribbled a story inside it.\n\nSince then, my heart has drawn ever deeper into writing. Writing about God’s Word, and teaching it to others, makes my soul sing. I’m certain it’s the thing I was created to do.\n\nHowever, it hasn’t always come easily. Around the time I dove headfirst into writing, God called me back to school. It felt like an obstacle to my dream, but not an insurmountable one, so I pressed on. Then, I got pregnant and had a baby. Then I got pregnant again and had another baby. All while I was still in school.\n\nBetween school and marriage and parenting, my attention was pulled in a lot of directions, and it wasn’t long before writing got put on the backburner. All the while, I watched as my writing friends achieved their own goals. One by one, they grew their ministries and published books, while I was lucky to steal an hour to write. My friends had reached the promised land, while I remained just outside it.\n\nWaiting is always hard, but it is made especially difficult by comparison. When your friends or colleagues attain the thing you want, it’s tough to hold on to contentment. The ache is somehow heightened by the sight of another’s success.\n\nWhen I read the story of Joshua, I wonder if he knew this ache. A skilled, lifelong warrior, Joshua wasn’t appointed to lead Israel until he was 90 years old. Then, he spent another decade guiding the Israelites into the promised land. After he accomplished all that, he dispensed the land to the twelve tribes of Israel. Only at the very end of the journey, and the very end of his life, after everyone else had received their inheritance, did Joshua receive his (Joshua 19:49-50). \n\nJoshua waited a lot, and I wonder how the story might have been different had he been guided by impatience. I wonder how his leadership might have been compromised had his spirit been discontent. Thankfully, Joshua succumbed to neither. He was a man who waited well. Rather than pine for the life he wanted, Joshua made himself available to the will of God. His waiting was both active and fruitful. \n\nI suspect Joshua did all this because he trusted God’s promises. He knew God would make good on His Word because He always does. From the start, God told Joshua what would be required to endure this particular journey: “Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them” (Joshua 1:6).\n\nGod always comes through. This was a truth that guarded the integrity of Joshua’s leadership. God promised to be with Joshua, to bring him success wherever he went (Joshua 1:7,9), and that’s just what He did. By trusting in God’s perfect timing, Joshua accomplished a lot through his waiting.\n\nThe story of Joshua reminds us that we don’t have to despair in the waiting. God’s promises are trustworthy, His plans are precise, and His timing is perfect—which means waiting isn’t a setback. It’s an opportunity. \n\nDon’t waste your waiting. Your story is much bigger than the ending.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nText: Joshua 20:1-9, Joshua 21:1-45, Exodus 21:12-14, Hebrews 2:14-15\n\nThe nation of Israel had been through a lot. \n\nThey conquered the land of Canaan, driving out existing nations and taking over the land. They crossed the raging Jordan River. Before that, they wandered in the desert for 40 years, waiting for God to signal when it was time to move. And before that, they were a nation of slaves, living in Egypt under hardship and oppression.\n\nYet God had His hand in all of it, like He does in our lives. In Genesis 15, God made a covenant promise to Abraham, spelling out exactly what would happen to his descendants.\n\nGod promised that Abraham would have numerous offspring. He kept that promise. The Israelites multiplied more and more the longer the Egyptians oppressed them (Exodus 1:12). \n\nGod promised Abraham that his descendants would be enslaved for 400 years. And they were. The Egyptians worked the Israelites ruthlessly and made their lives bitter (Exodus 1:13-14). \n\nGod also promised to judge the nation the Israelites served. Indeed, the Angel of the Lord killed all the firstborn of Egypt and passed judgment against the gods of Egypt (Exodus 12:12).\n\nGod promised that His people would leave the nation they served with overwhelming possessions. And they did. The Egyptians gave the Israelites silver, gold jewelry, and clothing as they left Egypt (Exodus 12:35-36).\n\nFinally, God promised to bring Abraham’s descendants back to the promised land. In Joshua, we see God drive out the inhabitants of Canaan and give the land to Israel (Joshua 21:43-44).\n\nWe serve the same God today. He makes promises to us as His children, just as He made promises to the house of Israel.\n\nHe will meet all our needs (Philippians 4:19).\n\nHe will provide for us (Matthew 6:33).\n\nHe will never leave us or forsake us (Deuteronomy 31:8).\n\nHe has a purpose for us (Romans 8:28).\n\nRemembering God’s faithfulness in our past helps us cling to His promises in our present. When I struggle to believe that He will provide for my needs, I remember how He provided that check in the mail at exactly the right moment. When I’m overwhelmed with loneliness, I think of the friendships He’s given me and how He Himself walked through dark moments with me. When I fear condemnation for my sin and mistakes, I recall the ways He’s already redeemed my past.\n\nGod’s promises are our foundation. He fulfills His every word. We can cling to His promises as we wander in the desert and fight the enemy. We can count on Him to be fully faithful (Joshua 21:45).\n\n“None of the good promises the Lᴏʀᴅ had made to the house of Israel failed. Everything was fulfilled.”\n-Joshua 21:45\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Joshua 22:1-34, 2 Corinthians 1:21-22, Psalm 7:8-11\n\n“I’ve never been asked to play Dixie® Cups before!” said my grandmother… and, well, most people. \n\nIt was my favorite childhood game: stealing the box of mouthwash cups from the bathroom, then dumping its contents onto the table and standing the paper cups to attention. \n\nIt was like playing a game of “Memory”—the object was to find the cup that matched the one in my hand. Except my game was better, because instead of only one possible match, there were probably twenty. Once a match was made, I’d add the pair to my prized, yet toppling, tower of cups. \n\nClearly my game did not require superior memory skills, but that little tower was a comforting sight nonetheless. I loved to remember that the odds were stacked in my favor. I needed to remember that. \n\nThe eastern tribes of Israel needed to remember, too. They’d wandered in the wilderness—twice!—but their journey was also bookended with two miraculous water crossings. As they crossed the Jordan River, they came across giant stones—ones they never would have seen without God making a way for them in the river. Marking each as a promise kept from the Lord, they began to stack them, creating an altar of remembrance. Each river stone said, God brought you out of the wilderness and carried you through this river. Remember this. \n\nThey were just rocks, and yet, they were so much more. Unlike an altar built for idol-worshipping, this was a token shouting out the one true God’s faithfulness, created in His presence and stacked high for all to see. \n\n“It is to be a witness between us and you, and between the generations after us, so that we may carry out the worship of the Lord in His presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fellowship offerings.”\n- Joshua 22:27\n\nA witness. The rocks their feet had walked across in obedience also bore witness to the grace of the Father, who makes small things significant and significant things small. \n\nMy Dixie cup towers were small yet significant, too—filled with joy, yet paper and disposable. It would’ve been easy for anyone to assume that my toppling tower was begging to be thrown away, when that wasn’t part of the game at all. Small and significant things are also easily misunderstood. \n\nWhen the western tribes of Israel encountered the eastern tribes’ altars of remembrance, they mistook them for a sign of aggression. They even began preparing for civil war! Oops. They couldn’t have known what the rocks meant. They couldn’t have seen their mistake. The Israelites, like you and I, were trying the best they could! But they were confused. \n\nDon’t worry—the tribes came together to discuss the matter, and fears fizzled as they recalled the Truth they held in common. “Yahweh is the God of gods! Yahweh is the God of gods!” (Joshua 22:22). They remembered what we are learning: The humans in the story may be confused, but the God of the story is sovereign and good. \n\nWhere there is human confusion, Christ is our resolve. Where we build towers, He seals hearts. While we build temporary remembrances of God, He has already created a permanent remembrance within us. “He has also sealed us and given us the Spirit as a down payment in our hearts” (2 Corinthians 1:21-22).\n\nWhether we walk in wilderness, or find a miraculous crossing, or build towers in His name, may we continue to put our trust and hope in God alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Joshua 23:1-16, Joshua 24:1-33, Matthew 11:28-30, Hebrews 4:1-13\n\nEven the greatest leaders die. As Joshua prepared for the end of his life, he addressed Israel—those people of God who had followed him through impossible circumstances to an improbable reward.\n\n“I am now going the way of all the earth, and you know with all your heart and all your soul that none of the good promises the Lord your God made to you has failed. Everything was fulfilled for you; not one promise has failed.”\n-Joshua 23:14\n\nIt was time for Joshua to go. In keeping with his steady voice as their leader, Joshua’s farewell address was a plea for Israel to do three things: Remember what God has done. Obey Him courageously and completely. Worship Him alone.\n\nI like to picture the scene as Joshua stood there in front of the tribes, relaying one last message from the Lord. I like to imagine the passion in his voice as he recounted their treacherous journey—how God rescued His people from generations of idol worship and multiplied their descendants, how He rescued them from slavery in Egypt and sustained them in the wilderness, and how He ushered them into the promised land, handing them every victory along the way. This line is my favorite:\n\n“I gave you a land you did not labor for, and cities you did not build, though you live in them; you are eating from vineyards and olive groves you did not plant.”\n-Joshua 24:13\n\nThe Lord did it all. And Joshua, with all the earnestness his 110 years could muster, was asking Israel to remember, to obey, and to worship the God of the Rescue.\n\nThis was not a call for arbitrary emotion or passive intention. This request was active and specific. Joshua gave the people instructions specific to their time and circumstance, but his admonition echoes even to us: “You are witnesses against yourselves that you yourselves have chosen to worship Yahweh” (Joshua 24:22). In other words, Don’t just say this. Mean it. Do it.\n\n“We are witnesses,” they said back to him.\n\n“Then get rid of the foreign gods that are among you and offer your hearts to the Lord, the God of Israel” (v. 23).\n\nI like Joshua’s style: “Okay then. Get on with it.”\n\nJoshua was a good leader. But even he did not perfectly fulfill the promises he solicited from the people. Even Joshua was a sinner in need of a savior. He was used by the Lord to secure a tangible inheritance for his people. But, like Joshua himself, that inheritance was only temporary. The rest from war would not last. \n\nNot even Joshua could bring God’s people salvation.\nJoshua couldn’t, but Jesus did.\n\nJesus obeyed perfectly and followed the Father faithfully. And when we did not and could not? Jesus satisfied God’s wrath for our sin and granted us the eternal benefit of His perfect obedience (Romans 3:25-26). Jesus has gone ahead of us into the very death that was ours and conquered it on our behalf (2 Timothy 1:10). Christ secured for us an inheritance that is eternal, a rest that will last (Hebrews 4:9).\n\nHere in the last chapters of Joshua, as we look back over the epic story of what God did for His people, we lean in and listen to the wise old man’s words: Remember what God has done. Obey Him courageously and completely. Worship Him alone.\n\nBe faithful to the God of the Rescue. And when your faithfulness fails, lean wholly on the grace of Christ. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 21:1-25, Deuteronomy 12:8-14, 2 Samuel 24:18-25\n\n“The Hollow Men” is a haunting, exquisite poem by T.S. Eliot. You may have heard the closing lines referenced in pop culture: “This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper.” \n\nI reread the poem after walking backward and forward through today’s passage in Judges, the final chapter of a brutal journey. We are trained, when reading stories, to settle into a conclusion not long after the climax. We long to be satisfied. The book of Judges doesn’t do that. \n\nEarlier in the poem, Eliot writes:\n\nThe eyes are not here\nThere are no eyes here\nIn this valley of dying stars\nIn this hollow valley\nThis broken jaw of our lost kingdoms\n… death’s twilight kingdom,\nThe hope only\nOf empty men.\n\nEliot’s “empty men” are a helpful comparison as we end our study of Judges. The weight and power of Eliot’s words capture, in ways I never could, the heart-wailing of the tribes of Israel. When death is the only hope, we are left in total darkness. \n\nWe know that Jesus is our conquering King, the life and light of men. But Judges doesn’t end with Jesus. Judges ends with a “valley of dying stars,” empty men grasping together at nothing. “In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes” (v. 25). As modern readers, we can read this last verse in Judges and know it’ll all be okay because Jesus is coming. Even though that is true, would you be willing to resist that temptation for closure with me today? \n\nLet us whimper. Let us feel the ache of the ages, the desperation for something we cannot name. The longing for a king that led the Israelites in caustic circles, is the same longing that leads us to fill our lives with stuff that distracts and tries to counteract that epic ache. \n\nThe inclination to grasp at goodness is the right response to reading the book of Judges. Our hearts are magnetized to light, not darkness. Judges provokes that tension in us, leaving us with an unsettled feeling. It is a historical book, a true tragedy tucked in the middle of the greatest book ever written. And yet, its darkness is unparalleled. Its darkness makes us crave light. \n\nChiaroscuro is an art technique that utilizes sharp contrasts—light and dark—for dramatic impact. Judges is a book of chiaroscuro. The whole picture of the Bible is made more vibrant, more impactful, more necessary because of these dark corners. We can thank God for the book of Judges, and we can thank Him for wiring our hearts to long for the goodness and light that only He provides.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 20:1-48, Deuteronomy 18:1-5, Proverbs 16:33\n\nIt all started with a little boy and itchy skin, which is honestly the worst way for anything to begin. He was my little brother, two years old at the time, and as the scratching continued, it became clear the cause was more than an irritation from running around in the grass or an aggravated mosquito bite. Still, my parents applied Cortisone cream and hoped for the best, leaving a message for the pediatrician to call in the morning.\n\nBut overnight, I, too, began to scratch my skin, and red bumps proved the cause to be more than an allergy to something we’d eaten for dinner the night before. By morning, my mom was also itchy, the final straw to explain our fate: chicken pox.\n\nSo there we were, all three of us, left to schedule back-to-back oatmeal baths, share anti-itch cream, take turns complaining, and inconvenience our one remaining caretaker, my father. To think this all started with a little boy and itchy skin.\n\nIsrael was quick to assume sin was a “someone else” problem, and if I’m being honest, I’m often guilty of doing the same. The crime at Gibeah? Certainly it was someone else’s fault. Surely, the people of Benjamin were the only ones who didn’t have it all together, and war needed to be waged against them to make everything right.\n\nBut first, God used the war against Benjamin to point out the ways Israel, too, was infected with sin. While these accounts are difficult to take in and unfold like a horror story, they all play a part in God reminding His children what happens when they forget Him and rely only on what they can see. Everyone was doing what appeared to be right in their own eyes, and that lead to death and destruction. \n\nThe Israelites first defeat at the hands of the badly outnumbered Benjaminites caused them to weep before the Lord and inquire of Him if they should attack again the next day. It wasn’t until their second failure that they turned to fasting and making sacrifices for their sins. It’s dangerous to keep on living in sickness, but unfortunately, many times it takes something truly terrible to recognize the destructiveness of sin.\n\nChapter 20 of Judges isn’t necessarily something you’d want to write on your dry erase board or commit to needlepoint, but it’s significant to the heartbeat of humanity. It’s been said that sometimes, to receive the depth of the good news, we must first be able to swallow the bad. And yet, here is my favorite part of this passage: God answered the Israelites, despite their sin. When they asked questions, no matter how infected their souls were, He answered. And that is the God we serve. \n\nWe may waver from Him and, for a time, commit to our own selfish ways, but by the grace of God, His commitment is to the changing of hearts. Our stories will all end with our sinful selves redeemed by the faithful Father. Thanks be to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Outrage in Benjamin",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nEditor’s Note: Some passages in Judges deal in subject matter that might be especially painful for some readers. Though many of the wounds we receive in this life are deeply personal and unimaginably painful, when they appear in God’s Word, we are reminded that He sees them. Whenever sin is addressed in Scripture—whether through teaching or story—it comes to us in the context of God’s unwavering commitment to bring an end to all evil in this world through the finished work of Christ (Revelation 21:3-4). We are praying for and with you as you read.\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 19:1-30, Jeremiah 8:18-9:3, 2 Corinthians 6:14-18\n\nThis is dark. I don’t like to think about horrible things. And I would like to think this story has nothing to do with me. Because I am A) not a terrorizer of women, B) not a concubine, and C) not a murderer. So I would like to be excused from this exercise and come back when we are talking about the wonderful grace of Jesus instead. Or maybe we could (please!) gloss over this and talk about how heaven will be paved with streets of gold. I’m here for all of that. \n\nBut perhaps we could be brave and try to look at this Judges 19 passage together.\n\nFirst, before we get too angry with the Levite for having a concubine in the first place, let’s consider what some scholars have to say about her: the concubine was probably the Levite’s wife, but was called a “concubine” because she was not endowed with a dowry. Either way, it looks like she was unfaithful to him and left him. \n\nThe delay caused by all the over-politeness in the house of her father meant that they stayed longer and later than intended. When they finally arrive in an Israelite city, there is only one man willing to take them in. Just as Lot was the only hospitable man in Sodom (Genesis 19:1–29), this old Ephraimite is the only refuge in Gibeah.\n\nThe men of Gibeah, like the men of Sodom, surrounded the house and sought to do great wickedness to the guests. The old Ephraimite, like Lot, offered a wicked substitution to preserve the Levite: he offered up his own daughter and the Levite’s concubine. The men of Gibeah took only the concubine, but abused her to death that night.\n\nThe Levite’s role that night seems to be one of passivity and cowardice. It is unclear how his action or inaction enter into the matter, although it seems his “eating and drinking” in this story are twice his undoing: first in delaying his departure from the house of her father, and second, in occupying him on this night of the wickedness of Gibeah.\n\nIn the morning, when he exited the house, he found his concubine on the steps, seemingly asleep. But when he found her to be dead, he took her up, returned home, and then sent out his bloody message to the chiefs of Israel, a testimony of the wickedness of Gibeah.\n\nThe Bible is brief and thrifty in its narratives. As with so much of Scripture, it comes to us in parables, in examples, often without explicit explanation of what we are to take away from it all. This passage, however, seems to give us direct instruction: “Think it over, discuss it, and speak up!” (Judges 19:30).\n\nWe are to be broken by the brokenness of this world, but not only of the world. We are to be broken by the brokenness of the Church, of God’s own people, of ourselves, and our own hearts (Jeremiah 8:21). Consider how profound a warning this story is against our passivity toward sin. Any sin, left to itself, can end in horrors unthinkable. \n\nMay we be broken over our own sin, over the sins of our people, and in the world! May Christ have mercy on us. May He deal kindly and gently with us, and give not to us as our sins deserve, but preserve us by His good will.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 18:1-31, Deuteronomy 17:18-20, Psalm 78:56-66\n\n“Just look away, look away. There’s nothing but horror and inconvenience on the way.” \n\nThis theme song plays grimly at the start of each episode of the television show, A Series of Unfortunate Events. Despite the warning, I kept watching and hoping the show’s main characters, three orphans, would eventually find relief. Each episode ended in dismay as the orphans’ lives spiraled further out of control. The story became more tragic at every turn. As I read Judges 18, the same theme song crept into the back of my mind: “Just look away, look away… ”\n\nIsrael’s story took dark turn after dark turn, as the people made bad choice after bad choice. Redeemed out of slavery, all their needs were taken care of by the Lord, yet they forgot their God and lost their way. Quickly they fell into sin and idolatry. We’re talking idol worship, murder, absolute lawlessness. How could God’s chosen people fall so far so fast?\n\nFrom the outside looking in, the Israelites’ missteps are plain to see. But in our own lives, it’s much easier to lose perspective. The Israelites thought they could run their lives better than God could. For example, we saw in today’s reading that God provided land for the tribe of the Danites, but they found a quiet town to conquer instead. Veering from God’s provision, they left behind a wake of physical and spiritual destruction. The Lord also asked the Israelites for their sole devotion, but the Danites opted for idol worship in instead (Judges 18:27–31).  \n\nThe Danites, a tribe of Israel, thought they could make a better, happier, more abundant future for themselves than the one the Lord had laid out for them. Sometimes I wonder, Am I guilty of this sort of arrogance too? Do I ever believe my plan is superior to the Lord’s? When I forget the goodness and wisdom of God, I’m likely to fall into the same trap of disobedience, foolishly thinking I can create a brighter future for myself than the one God has planned.\n\nWe choose our own plans because we don’t trust God’s plan is actually good for us. Or maybe, like the Danites, we forget that our God has the power to move mountains. Perhaps God calls us to give our money or time or energy, but we hold back. Or maybe He lays it on our hearts to repair a relationship, but we decide it’s better to sweep the issue under the rug. In the short term, we think our plan is less painful, more effective. But if we look at what happened with Israel when they forgot God’s instruction, it’s clear that a life of disobedience only brings pain and suffering.\n\nMay the Danites’ story remind us that we are all utterly lost without God’s guidance. We have access to God’s wisdom in Word and Spirit. Our Father in heaven knows what is best for us and works for our good. Placing our trust in the Lord and obeying Him will not always be easy, but we have a powerful promise of true life, flourishing, and full of purpose when we look to Jesus and walk in His ways.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 17:1-13, Leviticus 26:1, Hosea 11:1-12, James 3:9-12\n\nSometimes idolatry is easy to identify. For instance, when I find myself wanting to be more like my favorite Instagram celebrity than Jesus, I know I am idolizing the Instagram celebrity. Or, when I start prioritizing my body image over my spiritual health and well-being, I know I am idolizing how I look. But idolatry can also be stealthy, especially when it is disguised as piety. This is certainly the case for Micah, his shrines, and his priests.\n\nMicah’s story is a slow progression down a dangerous path. It begins with an offering to the Lord—the silver he had stolen from his mother. However, part of the offering is melted down and formed into an idol, something strictly forbidden by Hebrew law (Leviticus 26:1). This idol is then joined by other idols and set up as a shrine in Micah’s household. Micah even makes an ephod, which was a garment worn only by priests, and installs one of his sons as a priest to oversee the shrine.\n\nSlowly but surely, we see what Micah is doing: he is turning his home into a tabernacle. The transformation is complete when a young Levite shows up at his door. “Stay with me,” invites Micah, “and be my father and priest” (Judges 17:10). And the Levite stays, legitimizing Micah’s efforts. Then Micah says, “Now I know that the Lord will be good to me, because a Levite has become my priest” (v.13).\n\nThe elements are there—a priest from the appropriate tribe, the priestly garments, an offering of silver to the Lord—but Micah’s heart exposes his transactional relationship with God, and these motives reveal his idolatry: Now I know the Lord will be good to me.\n\nIdolatry in the name of the Lord is often the hardest to spot and the most destructive. I can easily idolize my religion over my Savior. I can lose trust in the promise of Christ and begin trusting in my church attendance or how often I volunteer or read Scripture. These rituals in and of themselves are good, but they are meant as an avenue to commune with God, not to be my own god. What often begins as an attempt to be near God can put distance between my heart and His.  \n\nMicah did not need to turn his home into a tabernacle and his family into priests, because God was already dwelling among the Israelites. In the same way, I don’t have to idolize my religion in an attempt to be nearer to God because He has already come near to me through the person of Jesus Christ, and He remains with me by the Holy Spirit.  \n\nMicah’s story proves that the line is fine between being active participants in our religion and idolizing it. What starts as piety can quickly slip into idolatry if we’re not careful. And in our attempt to be closer to God, we actually end up turning away from true and intimate relationship with Him.\n\nMay I heed the warning in Micah’s story and honestly examine my heart: Do I worship my religion, or do I worship the Lord, my God? \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Samson’s Defeat and Death",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 16:1-31, Jeremiah 15:15–16, Hebrews 11:32–38\n\nIt’s hard to know how to feel about Samson. Sure, he’s listed among the judges of Israel and later manages a nod in the Hebrews “Hall of Faith” (chapter 11). But every time I read his story, I scratch my head and wonder, Why?\n\nAfter all, he did sleep with prostitutes (Judges 16:1). His affair with Delilah was so toxic it reads like an episode of a certain popular dating reality TV series (vv. 4–20). He seems both arrogant and unwise, not exactly typical “man of God” material—not to mention all the killing. Isolated as a stand-alone narrative, this one feels like an outlier. But the flawed character of Samson (and the rest of the judges) is merely a lower layer of a greater story.\n\nThe heroes of our faith didn’t secure their status through flawless holiness. Every judge, every prophet, every disciple, and every deliverer had the same broken nature we do. From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible is the story of the most ragtag, rebellious, disappointing disciples imaginable—unless the story is not about them at all.\n\nThe stories of the judges of Israel, including Samson, and the stories of our own broken lives are merely footnotes in the bigger story—the story of a God who redeems, restores, and uses everything for our good and His glory.\n\nInstead of trying to convince ourselves that Samson is a worthy hero, we ought to let his flaws and failures remind us of the true Judge (Matthew 25:31–46), who rescues God’s people perfectly. Like a prism, let us hold Samson’s story up to the light, looking for the truth of who God is.\n\nSamson loved an undeserving woman who eventually betrayed him.\nJesus loves the bride of Christ, the Church, despite our long history of running from Him into the arms of other lovers.\n\nSamson was betrayed for a few pieces of silver.\n\nJesus was betrayed for an even lower price, His monetary value even less than a lustful, violent Nazarite.\n\nSamson was bound, humiliated, and tormented by the Philistines (Judges 16:19-21).\n\nJesus endured even worse for our sake (Isaiah 53).\n\nSamson’s enemies rejoiced too soon. The battle was not yet over. So must it have been with the powers of darkness, as Jesus lay dead and lifeless in a borrowed tomb. But just as Samson would rise again to bring down the house of his enemies, Jesus would rise from the grave on the third day to bring down the house on sin and death. Samson secured a limited and scandalous legacy (Judges 16:31). Not Jesus! He ripped history in two. Samson died among his enemies in a heap of rubble, while Jesus kept His promise that when His enemies tore down the temple, He would rebuild it in three days (John 2:19).\n\nSamson is a flawed frontrunner to our true Savior; therefore, Samson’s story is worth reading because it points to Someone so much better. God has provided something infinitely better for us in Jesus Christ (Hebrews 11:39–40), and because of Him, sin and death have been defeated once and for all (Romans 6:10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 15:1-20, Psalm 106:40-48, Isaiah 40:27-31\n\nGoodness, things just keep getting worse. \n\nReading Samson’s life story feels like watching a particularly dark television series. Death and destruction follow him everywhere he goes. In Judges 15, Samson sets fire to the tails of 300 foxes and sets the Philistines’ farmland and vineyards ablaze. His wife and father-in-law are burned to death in a gruesome retaliation. Men are ripped limb from limb. And when it’s all said and done, Samson, infused with the Spirit of the Lord, single-handedly kills 1,000 men with the jawbone of a donkey (Judges 15:16).\n\nWhat in the world is going on here? \n\nIt’s important to remember that in the midst of this bloody, heartbreaking story, God is still present, and that He has endowed Samson with great strength and fervor in order to free the Israelites from the Philistines. It’s also important to remember that redemption is never clean and simple. It is a bloody business. Samson is caught in a web of back-and-forth retaliation, and he knows in his heart that in the end, it is his job to rid the Israelites of their oppressors. \n\nWhen the Israelites find Samson hiding out in a cave, they do not join him to fight the way the Israelites have done in the past. No, they bind him and hand him over to the enemy. They cower. They see his strength, but they do not see him as a savior. Instead of recognizing Samson as a deliverer, they hand him over to the Philistines, bound and ready for death. But Samson inflicts justice on the Philistines through this small, weak weapon: the jawbone of a donkey. It is an unexpected, bloody redemption.\n\nDoes this story sound familiar at all? \n\nMany years after the time of the judges, God sent the Israelites a Savior who is one with God and full of the Spirit (John 1:1–18; Luke 3:21–22). Rather than recognize His strength, the Israelites handed Jesus over to their oppressors and Pontius Pilate to be crucified.\n\nBut this time—this final time—the blood that was shed was not of the enemy. God turned the story on its head. Rather than kill off the Romans, Jesus went to the cross willingly to shed His own blood for us. It is an unexpected, bloody redemption. \n\nThanks be to God for saving us from ourselves, our sin, and the schemes of the enemy. May we give thanks to His holy name, and rejoice in praising Him (Psalm 106:47).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Samson’s Riddle",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 14:1-20, Isaiah 11:1-5, Matthew 13:16\n\nA number of years ago, I met a famous person I had long respected from afar. This is always a tense experience, isn’t it? Most of us, I think, when we encounter famous people, get nervous to some degree. It happens to me less now than it did before because I have interacted with a number of “famous” Christians through my job. But still, especially when meeting some people, my palms get sweaty. Beyond that tension, I’m afraid that when I meet a famous person he or she is not going to be nice. Meeting someone we admire only to learn he or she is human is disorienting and disappointing.\n\nIn Judges 14, we continue to read about Samson, a judge appointed by God, a distinguished leader of God’s people, and a massive disappointment. We have already been exposed to Samson and his background, but it is here in chapter 14 that we see his disobedience. In verses 1–4, Samson disobeys the will of his parents and seeks a Philistine woman “because she seemed right to [him]”  (v. 7). This is a foreshadowing of his weakness. For all his physical strength, for all his natural gifting, he is proving to be weak in character. \n\nSamson shares a riddle with Philistine men at his marriage feast. He will pay them handsomely if they solve the riddle within a week, and they will pay him if they don’t. Because they have trouble solving the riddle, they threaten Samson’s wife, which leads her to squeeze the answer out of him, despite Samson not giving the answer to his mother or father. He loses the bet because his wife gives the Philistine men the answer. This leads Samson to kill thirty other Philistine men in order to pay up his end of the bet.\n\nFlashes of Samson’s strength, reliance on the Spirit of God, and anointing give glimpses of what the true Savior of God’s people, Jesus, would one day look like. Some may have thought Samson would be the deliverer of Israel, but unfortunately, he sought his own way and was undermined by his weakness. \n\nIn Isaiah 11 we read that the Savior of the world would shoot up from the stump of Jesse, in the line of David, and deliver the people of God from their disobedience and weakness. His justice would be righteous because His wisdom is from above. Jesus, our perfect Judge (Matthew 25:31-46), “will not judge by what he sees with his eyes, he will not execute justice by what he hears with his ears” (Isaiah 11:3).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 13:1-25, Numbers 6:1-12, Isaiah 9:6\n\nI have always wanted to need glasses. While my peers growing up feared being called “four eyes” as a result of their impaired vision, I teemed with jealousy over their newest accessory. While I’m, of course, very grateful for my 20/20 vision, I secretly fear reading glasses will no longer be in style when I actually (fingers crossed) need them one day. \n\nWhen it comes to this life, I think we all secretly hope that there’s more than meets the eye, that we aren’t quite seeing the full truth just yet. When we experience pain we don’t understand and our circumstances don’t turn out the way we’d hoped, we try to analyze things from all angles. How did this happen? Did I miss something? How could I have avoided all this suffering? Wouldn’t it be a huge relief to look through a viewfinder and have someone adjust things until they appear more clearly, until we’re able to make sense of what we see?\n\nThe gospel is the viewfinder through which all things make sense. Sin has damaged our vision for God’s goodness and plan, making it impossible for us to see with clarity until He removes the veils from our eyes in the heavenly realm. Then we will see the details that go into God’s promise to make all things new. Only then will we begin to fathom the lengths to which He’s gone to keep His promises. But until that time, life on earth is full of hoping and longing, and the occasional glimpse into God’s bigger story at play.\n\nAll throughout the book of Judges, it’s obvious that Israel is blinded by their own sin. In fact, this ominous phrase occurs for the seventh time in today’s reading: “The Israelites again did what was evil in the Lord’s sight” (Judges 13:1). Israel had come to trust only what their own eyes could see.\n\nImagine the surprise Manoah and his wife must have felt when, after years of barrenness, the angel of the Lord announced that they would have a son. It’s doubtful they saw this blessed, yet baffling, news coming. Many questions followed: How can this be? What will the boy’s responsibilities and work be? What is this angel’s name, who has brought us this great news? While they didn’t receive answers to those questions, the angel’s instruction made it clear that this son was to be set apart and “holy to the LORD during the time of consecration” (Numbers 6:8).\n\nClearly, there was more at work than what their human eyes could see. Samson’s impending birth was an introduction to the birth of new possibilities they never could have dreamt up for themselves, an unexpected form of redemption, bringing God’s heart a little more into focus. As God’s children, this is where we can settle our trust: Christ’s coming keeps us focused on hope. Even if all the other details of life seem blurry and unknown, we know we can put our trust in Him. May we view this story and our own as just a small piece of the grander reality of God’s great plan for His people. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 12:1-15, 1 Samuel 8:19-22, Ecclesiastes 5:4-7\n\nJephthah’s life is starting to unravel. Because of his rash vow, his daughter is dead and his family is broken. Jephthah was wrong to make that vow, and he was wrong to keep it. Because he was called into leadership by men instead of being raised up by God, he was man’s solution to a problem that can only be solved by God. And now, after a seemingly great victory over the Ammonites, the Ephraimites are pounding at his door and threatening to burn his house down over a ridiculous tiff.\n\nIronically, Jephthah’s house is really already on fire by the time the Ephraimites come for him, sharpening their flints. And the fire that burned was kindled by Jephthah’s very own hands and lips. It was the destructive fire of his sin. And he couldn’t keep the smoldering smoke a secret for long.\n\nThe Ephraimites have no good reason to pick a fight with Jephthah. They are angry because he didn’t summon them to help fight the Ammonites. Since he had been called to leadership by the Gileadites, Jephthah really had no authority to summon the tribe of Ephraim to war in the first place. But once they Jephthah is victorious over the Ammonites, they want a piece of that juicy victory and rise up against Jephthah.\n\nIn Shakespeare’s epic tragedy, Hamlet, Queen Gertrude groans, “When sorrows come, they come not as single spies, but in battalions.” In the same way, as Jephthah’s sins pile up, he continues to trudge forward in his own strength, his wrongs and sorrows compounding. Before he knows it, his own house is in shambles. A threat from foreigners to burn his house down is laughable because he has already burned what is valuable with his own actions. No amount of water could douse the flames ignited by the murder of his own daughter. This sin that was closest to his heart ended his career. His time as a judge was over. Jephthah was so burned by the evil that cauterized his family, he could not recover.\n\nOur darkest and most burning sins damage us in profound ways. But hope is never lost. Sometimes fire is the severe mercy we require. “This third I will put into the fire; I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will call on my name and I will answer them; I will say, ‘They are my people,’ and they will say, ‘The Lord is our God’” (Zechariah 13:9). Even if the house of your heart is on fire, call on His name and He will answer you.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 11:1-40, Leviticus 18:21, Leviticus 20:2-5, Matthew 5:34-37\n\nWhen God delivers His people, He “raises up” a deliverer to lead them. Take Moses and Gideon (Exodus 9:16; Judges 6:12), Othniel and Samuel (Judges 3:9; 1 Samuel 2:35), Jeroboam and Cyrus (1 Kings 14:7; Isaiah 45:13), and of course, Jesus (Jeremiah 23:5)—just to name a few.\n\nBut when we read about these deliverers in Scripture, we see that God’s people were often impatient, just like we so often are. And so instead of waiting for God to raise up a leader of His choosing for them, they would drudge up their own. They sought out their own solutions instead of seeking God’s perfect will. \n\nThat’s what’s happening in this passage with Jephthah. God didn’t raise up Jephthah to be Israel’s leader.  Instead Jephthah, who had surrounded himself with worthless men (Judges 11:3), got the call to lead from the elders. He wasn’t raised up by God—he was urged to leadership by men who were gripped with fear and desperation.\n\nThat should have been their first red flag: the desire to circumvent God’s way of doing things. David later explained it this way, “Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain” (Psalm 127:1). But it’s hard to wait on God, and it seems much easier to just get on with our own solutions. However, apart from God, our own solutions can go terrifically wrong. But God is also kind, and He often forestalls judgment as we find our way back to Him.\n\nJephthah wasn’t a totally bad guy. He knew the Scriptures, and he knew the history of Israel. He tried to get the land back and reclaim Israel’s territories. But, like you and me, while Jephthah loved goodness and sought to do right, he also had some sneaky, low-dealing tendencies.\n\nThe combination of human error and ignoring God’s way brings us to Jephthah’s horrifically rash vow. I don’t know if human sacrifice was on his mind when he made the extravagant promise, or why he persisted in carrying out the vow after he realized his daughter would be its victim. But it’s a chilling image of what can happen when a people ignore God’s way and stubbornly turn away from His principles. Jephthah took his bad promise too far, and a celebration was turned into a funeral.\n\nMay the Lord protect our hearts from rushing to do things—even good things—our own way and on our own terms. May He give us courage to relent and humility to repent when we make bad decisions. May we lean on His strength and His promises, not our own, and may our “yes” mean “yes,” and our “no” mean “no” (Matthew 5:36-37). We can stop and turn our hearts toward Him. Even when it seems like we are already too committed to our own way, God waits to lead us back to His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Wynter Pitts\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 10:1-18, Isaiah 30:15, Luke 15:11-32\n\nMy mother became a Christian when she was just a few months pregnant with me. I now realize she literally grew in her relationship with Christ while simultaneously teaching and leading me as she learned. In short, I grew up learning a lot about God. I participated in Bible memory contests, collected money for missionaries around the world, and had a part in both Christmas and Easter performances annually. My mother led me the best she knew how, yet I still rebelled.\n\nI knew biblical principles,\nbut I did not apply them to my everyday life.\nI knew the Bible as God’s Word, that He is the Creator of the universe,\nbut I did not honor Him as my Father.\nI knew Jesus lived a perfect, holy, and blameless life,\nbut I did not know He loves me even though I cannot do the same.\nI knew Jesus died to save the world from sin,\nbut I did not live as God’s forgiven daughter.\n\nHaving knowledge of God and choosing to live a life that honors Him are two very different things, and they will lead to two very different life experiences. This is exactly what is happening in today’s passage. There is no mistaking that the Israelites knew God. Judges 10:11 reminds us they had experienced His deliverance, His protection, and His love over and over again. Yet time after time they forsook the God they knew, preferring the comforts of what they could see and touch. They chose the false gods and cultural influences of surrounding nations over their faithful God. \n\nOur struggles today remain the same. While we may not be tempted to worship the god of Baal, our false gods are just as dangerous. The tangible items we are so tempted to chase—money, people, success—are just as dishonoring when worshiped in place of the one true God. God did not want the Israelites to simply know of Him. He wanted them to know Him personally, to trust Him, confide in Him, and find their lives in Him. God wants the same for us now; He wants His people to choose Him.\n\nIt’s easy to look at the stories we read in the Bible and wonder how God’s people could experience His patience, love, and miraculous intervention and yet still put their trust in other things. It’s easy to point the finger in judgment, but it would be far more beneficial for us to reflect on our own idolatry. In doing so, we will likely find places in our own hearts where we need to repent, seeking forgiveness and healing from the God who longs to be gracious to us (Isaiah 30:18). \n\nGod is compassionate and merciful. He provides leadership, guidance, and personal opportunities to experience His love. But as His children, we must take action, choosing to surrender to Him and worship Him with our lives. The ultimate provision of His faithful love comes in the very person of Jesus Christ—the sure image of the invisible God the Israelites so longed for and the Savior we all need. He alone stands by ready to rescue. In our surrender to Him, we will experience the deliverance, forgiveness, compassion, and rest promised to His children (Isaiah 30:15).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 9:1-57, Psalm 68:11-14, John 4:19-24\n\nThe book of Judges is bleak, but chapter 9 is particularly devastating. A passage like this forces us to see the devastation that bad men can wreak. Sometimes the only appropriate response to something like this is, “How long, O Lord?” That is my posture today. \n\nGideon died and the people of Israel once again worshiped Baal, the fake god. When he passed, Gideon left behind seventy (yes, 70) sons. Abimelech was one of those sons, born to a prostitute and bent on being king. So he killed all but one of his brothers (Jotham), and rallied the people of Shechem to make him king. \n\nAbimelech was awful and opportunistic, a greedy and prideful man. Knowing this, Jotham floated him a warning in the form of a parable: A forest of cedar trees wanted a king, and so they asked an olive tree, fig tree, and grape vine to do the job. All three declined, and instead asked the trees of the forest to consider what it would be like to no longer produce the fruit that pleases both people and God. \n\nTurns out the olive tree, fig tree, and grape vine knew their place and their calling; they were content in the roles given to them by the Lord. But the bramble, an opportunistic and destructive plant, said yes—he would be their king (vv. 7–15). One commentary I read compared the bramble to the Southern vine kudzu, which ruthlessly takes over anything in its path. Jotham knew Abimelech would do the same. \n\nGod sought vengeance for the murder of Abimelech’s brothers, sending “an evil spirit between Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem” (v. 22). A man named Gaal started a coup against him, and when Abimelech learned of the plot to overthrow him, he unleashed a violent terror against his people. He “razed the city and sowed it with salt” (v. 45), making it infertile land, destroying it not just for the present, but for generations after. To round out his wrath, he burned a tower filled with people, killing more than a thousand.\n\nAbimelech’s anger would echo for decades. We don’t know exactly how Abimelech salted the earth, but Scripture describes just how destructive this practice might have been, leaving behind soil as a “burning waste of sulfur and salt, unsown, producing nothing, with no plant growing on it” (Deuteronomy 29:23). \n\nThis is the definition of “scorched earth,” a turn-of-phrase typically reserved for military strategies. It is Sherman’s march to the sea in the Civil War and the campaign of Agent Orange in the Vietnam War. It is the devastation we see throughout both history and Scripture. It leaves us to cry out, “How long, O Lord?” \n\nSin has scorched the whole earth, and our whole hearts. It leaves nothing to satisfy us. We are only refreshed, rebuilt, and renewed when we look to Jesus. He is the only One who can water a scorched earth and a hardened heart, and He does. And He will. Thanks be to God. \n\n",

After all, “our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this darkness, against evil, spiritual forces in the heavens” (Ephesians 6:12). \n\nYes, we’re the sheep of God’s flock (Psalm 95:7), the tiny chicks He tucks up under His wings (Psalm 91:4) and His dearly loved children (Ephesians 5:1). But these tender images don’t tell the whole story. We are warriors, enlisted for battle against an enemy bent on rebellion against God and the destruction of His image bearers. Truth, peace, faith, and salvation are standard issue armor for Christ’s followers (Ephesians 6:14-17). Why fit us for battle if we’ll never be expected to fight?\n\nIn Judges 8 we find Gideon serving as the general of God’s army. He’s already led the charge in a battle that left the enemy bleeding and scattered (Judges 7:19-25). From our view on the sidelines, we wouldn’t have faulted this band of brothers if they’d simply let the remaining rebels limp away toward the hills. Instead we find them in hot pursuit. The front of darkness had been pushed back, yet they knew the fighting was not over. They were worn out, battle weary, low on energy and strength, and yet they pursued because there was still an enemy at large.\n\nThese words from Gideon’s story have sunk deeply into my gut: “exhausted yet pursuing” (v.4, ESV). They jar me into remembering that for the army of God, the orders haven’t changed. Until Christ returns for us, there will always been skirmishes between flesh and blood, good and evil, light and darkness. There will be times when God’s strength will empower us to push back the front of darkness, but the enemy hasn’t yet raised the flag of surrender. And in the words of Bible teacher Kay Arthur, “There’s no retirement in the time of war.”\n\nAs long as our enemy is on the run and still gunning for the people of God, retirement isn’t an option. Though we may find ourselves weary and worn out from the battle, or celebrating a God-given victory, let us not sit back and rest on our laurels. Let us raise our swords and keep fighting.\n\nFighting for truth.\nFighting for hope.\nFighting for love.\nFighting to make the gospel known.\n\nIn other words, “Let us not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don’t give up” (Galatians 6:9). Until the Lord blasts His trumpet, signaling the final fall of our enemy, may He find us like Gideon’s army—exhausted yet pursuing, and empowered by the strength of our Savior, who “is the power and the wisdom of God” (1 Corinthians 1:24).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 7:1-25, Isaiah 41:10, Ephesians 6:10\n\nWhen was the last time you were in a battle you could not win without divine intervention?\n\nIt’s hard for me to find an answer. Sure, I enjoy the occasional challenge, but I like to keep those challenges to a minimum, so I can feel capable and in control. And if I’m honest, I’m happy with this life of manageable risks—enough to create some drama, but not so much that it requires great faith. There’s an underlying pride to living like this, because when things go well, I can answer, “Oh that’s easy. I did it myself.”\n\nNews flash: God doesn’t need me, and He doesn’t need you.\n\nI know that sounds harsh, but that’s kind of the point of Judges 7. I wonder if that’s what Gideon told his men that day as they prepared to face down the greatest enemy of their time. “Are you scared? You can leave. God doesn’t need you.” In that one moment, two-thirds of Gideon’s army walked away. Can you imagine? You’re standing there, covered in armor, and the person to your left and your right both leave. The field must have felt very empty. \n\nBut God wasn’t done whittling down the troops. He told Gideon to take his men to the water and split them into “kneelers” and “lappers.” Commentaries disagree about the “How do they drink water?” test; some argue that it was an arbitrary way to narrow down the fighting force quickly, while others wonder if the “lappers” let down their guard. Could it be that God chose to use the most irresponsible men to make the victory that much more miraculous? Regardless, what was a force of more than 30,000 at the beginning of the day had been narrowed to just 300.\n\nWe know how this story ends, but the men in Gideon’s army did not. And as much as God reassured them, on paper it was a suicide mission. This risk didn’t require strength or chariots or better weapons or more “hustle.” It required faith in divine intervention. It required them to rely on God alone, to “be strengthened by the Lord and by his vast strength” (Ephesians 6:10).\n\nThe men who went into the valley needed faith, but the men who were sent away needed it just the same. I can imagine their startled disbelief as Gideon pointed them away from the water. “Wait! We’re the fearless ones! Surely God needs us!” But He didn’t, and those men needed to know where their power came from. For the men who left and the men who went down into the valley, God’s strength combined with their faith led to an epic victory.\n\nGod loves you, but He doesn’t need you. And that isn’t harsh news—it’s freedom. No matter how deep the valley, no matter how big the army you’re up against, He’s not waiting for you to build some spiritual muscle in order to handle that challenge. He already has the strength. All He needs if for you to have faith in Him—whether He’s calling you to face it or walk away.\n\nGideon wasn’t the only warrior who God sent seemingly outnumbered into battle. In the war for our souls, God sent His Son Jesus to take down humanity’s greatest enemy. Jesus went into the valley alone,  voluntarily laying down His life, taking the punishment we deserve, so we could claim His victory over death as our own. This is how strong our God is. Nothing can stand up to Him. Not even death itself.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 6:1-40, Psalm 127:1, James 1:16-17\n\nWhen we read Judges 6, we see that Gideon is certainly having a low moment. We find this youngest son from the weakest tribe crouching in the winepress trying to thresh wheat in secret, so the mighty Midianite army won’t get a whiff of his harvest and swoop down to steal it. All of Israel was feeling abandoned by God and their hearts were confused and resentful. Every time they tried to get back up, they were gleefully knocked down by some neighboring pagan army. God’s chosen people wondered if He had given up on them and chosen someone else to love, protect, and set apart for Himself.\n\nBut Israel wasn’t down because God had forgotten them. They were hiding in caves because they had stubbornly and persistently chased after evil for many years. They had established traditions and patterns that avoided God altogether. The paths their feet traced in their homes and in their towns led them in the ways of wickedness. They were in a rut, and it’s hard to look up and figure your way out of habitual sin.\n\nIt takes something dramatic to turn our hearts back toward God.\n\nGideon was trudging his sweaty rut like the rest of Israel, when an angel of the Lord appeared to him. Why would an angel appear to him? It wasn’t because Gideon was the one honorable man among thousands; it was because God’s time was right to raise up a leader in Israel. It is God who marks the seasons, who raises up leaders, and who brings down empires. “Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor over it in vain” (Psalm 127:1). All other planning and plotting is futile. \n\nI’ve never had to hide from an army, but I have had some low moments. I’m sure many of us can remember feeling confused and resentful at some point. In spite of our doubts and ruts, and the habitual trails that lead us to wickedness, God can lift us up to victory with Him. Gideon didn’t just decide to grit his teeth and pitch his military plan to the leaders. God chose him, called him, and promised him victory “as if Mideon were one man” (Judges 6:16).\n\nWhatever your circumstances may be today, don’t let them scare you. Don’t let the worn pathways of sin lure you into hopelessness. Don’t be deceived by the voices that tell you that your sin is too great, that your habits can never be broken. Our God can rescue and redeem even the most lost. He is light in the blackest night. Run to the One who controls the sea and the stars, and trust Him with your darkest secrets. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Emily Chapman Richards\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 4:1-24, Judges 5:1-31, Job 19:25-27, Psalm 68:7-10\n\nMy husband and I have the privilege of shepherding three little ladies through life, and our evenings often end with the same bedtime ritual. We read a story, pray together, and sing. For my middle daughter, it is quite important that we sing the same three songs every evening: “Before the Throne of God Above,” “Magnificat,” and “The Lord’s Prayer”—usually in that order. If I’m honest, this sometimes frustrates me. Why can’t we have some variety in our song choice? But, as I continued to think through today’s readings, I have come to see our same three songs in a new light. \n\nThe book of Judges recounts the tragedy of forgetfulness. It is a story of the Israelites’ downward spiral, culminating in Judges 21:25: “In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did whatever seemed right to him.” However, there is a momentary break in this downward spiral with the arrival of Deborah. \n\nWe first meet Deborah in Judges 4. She is sitting under a tree conducting business as usual, judging and prophesying. The Israelites, having suffered oppression at the hands of the Canaanites for twenty years, cry out to the Lord for deliverance. He inclines His ear, and speaking through Deborah, reveals a rescue plan by way of a woman named Jael, who ultimately kills King Jabin’s military leader, Sisera. This victory sets in motion the unraveling of Canaan’s defense and, ultimately, makes way for the Israelites to enjoy forty years of peace—double the amount of time they originally spent under King Jabin’s oppression. \n\nWhat is Deborah and Barak’s response? They break out into a victory song! They sing, detailing how God provided deliverance from their enemies. But their praise did more than serve as a celebration in that moment. It became a vehicle for future generations to remember God’s faithfulness. Compared to the rest of the book in its entirety, the song of Judges 5 interrupts the narrative flow, and is an intentional break in the story for the purpose of remembering. Like David in Psalm 68, Deborah and Barak are recalling and recounting the faithfulness of God. May we do the same. \n\nMay we remember what God has done: “God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the desert… You, God, showered abundant rain; you revived your inheritance when it languished” (Psalm 68:7,9). \n\nMay we remember what God is doing: “Israel’s leaders took charge, and the people gladly followed. Praise the LORD!” (Judges 5:2).\n\nMay we remember what God has promised to do: “But I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the end he will stand on the dust… I will see him myself; my eyes will look at him, and not as a stranger” (Job 19:25,27).\n\nWhich brings me back to those same three songs my family sings together at bedtime. We, like the Israelites, are tempted to forget, to lose sight of who we are and why we are here. It is our remembrance of what God has done for us that fights forgetfulness and propels us forward in our mission as followers of Jesus. May today, tomorrow, and all the days we’ve been given, be spent singing the praises of our holy, just, and infinitely loving God. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Lord Tests Israel",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 3:1-31, Psalm 91:1-16\n\nJust over a hundred years ago, a funny belief began to crop up among Western Christians. In Europe especially, Christians had enjoyed a long season of prosperity and peace, which began to shape their theology. They concluded that humans were evolving, outgrowing the bad habits of violence, war, and sin. Humans, they reasoned, were essentially good, and getting better with every generation.\n\nWhat these Christians developed was a weak view of sin and an idealistic view of human nature, and it remained popular for a while. It shaped Christians’ faith and the way they read Scripture, but it didn’t last very long. In 1914, the world was plunged into World War I, which shattered all of those illusions. As it turned out, humans were not evolving out of sin. In fact, we were no different than any generation before us. If anything, humans were only “advancing” in our technology for fighting each other. \n\nThis bit of Church history is good to keep in mind while reading the book of Judges, because it demonstrates a principle we will see again and again. Old Testament scholar Walter Brueggemann once wrote, “Prosperity breeds amnesia,” and there is perhaps no better description of what happened to Christians a century ago, and what happened to the Israelites in Judges. Every time the Israelites prospered, they didn’t simply forget God; they forgot what it means to be human in the world. They forgot their own sin. They forgot the world’s brokenness. And they forgot how desperately they needed God. So they lived as if they didn’t.  \n\nWe should never be too quick to explain the stories of violence and suffering in Judges. Neat and tidy answers almost always do a disservice to these difficult passages. That said, it is safe to say that the cycle of foreign invasions had an eye-opening effect on the Israelites, in the same way that World War I shattered the rose-colored glasses of idealistic Christians. When God tested “all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars” (Judges 3:1), you can’t help but wonder if this was another way of saying, “In the absence of war, the Israelites had forgotten. They had forgotten their weakness. They had forgotten their vulnerability. They had forgotten that they needed God.” \n\nIt was true then and it is still true today: prosperity breeds amnesia. In times of comfort, we do not simply forget God, but we also forget the seriousness of sin, the brokenness of this world, and why we so desperately need a Savior to mend it. That said, this kind of forgetting is one that most people in the world are never afforded. In regions of famine and civil war, it’s impossible to ignore that this world is not as it should be. But for those of us living in relative comfort, who rarely bump up against the jagged edges of this fractured planet, we can forget just how devastating the effects of sin have been.\n\nThat is one lesson we can take from Judges. It challenges us not only to remember God, but to remember our brokenness and the brokenness of the world. When we downplay sin, we downplay grace, and we downplay our dependency on it. So as ugly and horrible as suffering can be, and as much as it grieves God most of all, through it we can detect the still, small voice of the Spirit whispering to us: “This is why you need a Savior. This is why I came.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 2:1-23, Deuteronomy 4:9, 2 Timothy 2:2\n\nIn Judges 2, we read about two generations of Israelites: the Joshua generation and the post-Joshua generation. Joshua’s generation was faithful. Scripture says, “The people worshiped the LORD throughout Joshua’s lifetime and during the lifetimes of the elders who outlived Joshua. They had seen all the LORD’s great works He had done for Israel” (Judges 2:7).\n\nHowever, the post-Joshua generation was not faithful. After Joshua’s death and after the death of the elders who outlived him, this generation rose up as one who “did not know the LORD or the works He had done for Israel.” Therefore, they “did what was evil in the LORD’s sight” (Judges 2:10-11).\n\nOne generation had witnessed the great works the Lord had done for His people on their journey to claiming the promised land—the other had not. Because of this, this new generation turned from God to worship idols instead.\n\nIn graduate school, I had a good friend who was an atheist. We often talked about faith and Christianity. He thought it was odd that Christians felt the need to gather together once a week. “If the whole Jesus story is really true,” he said, “why do you all need to gather once a week to remind each other of it?”\n\nIt was a good question. At the time, I didn’t have a good answer, but I think Judges 2 speaks to this question. When we don’t remember the works of the Lord, we turn from him, and because we are made for worship, we look for other gods to worship. Like the children of Israel began to worship the gods of the Canaanites, we may begin to worship the gods our friends are worshiping, or the gods the media tells us to worship. We can easily lose sight of the one true God.\n\nThis is why Christians gather each Sunday and tell the same story again and again. This is why we drink from the cup and eat the bread. Jesus said, “Do this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19). He wanted us to remember, because He knew what would happen if we forgot.\n\nI don’t know what happened between Joshua’s generation and the next. Did they stop telling the story of what the Lord had done? Did this generation not hear about the parting of the Red Sea? The manna? The cloud that led the people by day and the pillar of fire that led them by night? Did they not heed this charge in Deuteronomy?\n\nBe on your guard and diligently watch yourselves, so that you don’t forget the things your eyes have seen and so that they don’t slip from your mind as long as you live.\n\nTeach them to your children and your grandchildren.\n- Deuteronomy 4:9\n\nWe don’t really know the answer. What we do know is one generation was faithful to God because they had seen what the Lord had done. The next generation was not, because they did not know what the Lord had done.\n\nHow grateful I am for those who’ve gone before me, telling their children of the great works the Lord has done. How thankful I am for those children, who then went on to tell their children about God, until the story trickled down through generations into a Church that is still gathering, still remembering, still passing the cup.\n\nLord, help us to remember your works and to never stop telling others about Your goodness. In continuing to worship You, the one true God, may we bring you glory, so the next generation might do the same.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessica Lamb\n\nScripture Reading: Judges 1:1-36, Genesis 49:8-12, Psalm 34:17\n\nI still remember the misguided giddiness I felt when my eighth grade English teacher announced we would be reading Romeo and Juliet. I knew little of Shakespeare at the time, beyond the belief that he was someone I should read and appreciate. All I really knew of the star-crossed pair was that they, and their love story, were famous. \n\nSo when I came to the end of the play, I was livid. Romeo and Juliet were both dead, and there was no happily ever after. What sort of love story was this? \n\nIt isn’t one, really. It’s a tragedy. Every twist and turn that leads to the demise of the young couple is meant to bring an ache to our hearts, because we realize how easily it could have been avoided. We’re meant to feel upset and distressed at the ending. That’s how tragedy works.\n\nThe book of Judges is the tragic, true story of the people of Israel ignoring God’s instructions, and then abandoning their faith to live like their pagan neighbors. After God’s people endured 400 years of slavery in Egypt, followed by forty years of wandering in the wilderness, Joshua led Israel into the promised land. Toward the end of his life, Joshua warned the Israelites to worship the Lord and serve Him only, and instructed them to drive the Canaanite people out of the land, so they would not be tempted to follow a false religion (Joshua 24:14-15). \n\nBut these opening verses in the book of Judges warn us that the Israelites didn’t obey. They repeated the sins of the Egyptians and enslaved the Canaanite people. They failed to drive the Canaanites out completely, and failed to fully establish a land of their own. And like the opening lines of Romeo and Juliet, we are warned that what we are about to read is a tragedy. \n\nIn Judges, the people of Israel forsake the Lord and adopt the worship practices of the Canaanites. They experience chaos and catastrophe in a time of unprecedented violence and oppression, led by mostly corrupt and cowardly judges. The Israelites become almost unrecognizable as the people of God. And then the book of Judges abruptly ends, with everyone doing whatever seems right to them (17:6). As readers, we’re left with a sense of longing for how things ought to be.\n\nBut God continues to work. The book of Ruth tells us that during this time, famine in Israel sent Naomi’s family to Moab, where her son married a woman named Ruth before he died. Ruth, a Moabite, pledged to stay with Naomi, an Israelite, and embrace the God of Israel. She went on to give birth to Obed, King David’s grandfather. From this lineage came Jesus, the Savior of the world. Our hope, the hope of all creation, is rooted in a foreign widow’s decision to follow God during the bleak time of the judges.\n\nI pray that as we read Judges, we will discover the source of true redemption, and turn back to the One who redeems. For when “the righteous cry out… the LORD hears, and rescues them from all their troubles” (Psalm 34:17).\n\nWe can draw hope from the fact that God continues to work through morally compromised, deeply flawed people and circumstances. He isn’t limited by our shortcomings. He isn’t stopped by the brokenness in our world. His story—and because of Him, our story—is not one of tragedy, but one of profound beauty and hope in Jesus Christ. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

Fox with feathered hair and a sweater vest. No? If you didn’t grow up under the tutelage of ‘80s sitcoms, all you need to know is this: Alex P. Keaton and family always had a little drama brewing. But, thirty minutes and some live studio-audience laughter later, things seemed to work themselves out. \n\nAlas, you and I aren’t living in an ‘80s sitcom. Real life is happening and we’re in the thick of it. Relationship issues don’t always resolve with a sincere side hug, and problems aren’t limited to finding a date for the school dance. \n\nLife is hard. It is beautiful, yes; but gosh, is it hard. Dear friends suffering from deep depression, family members whose loss stings as sharply as when their loved one first left, children who are hungry and enslaved around the world, and wars that rage on for reasons long forgotten. Not to mention the stack of dishes in the sink, the pile of unpaid bills on the counter, and the decision you just can’t bear to make. \n\nLife is hard.\n\nThe book of Ruth is a book about real life. It is the story of a family and of one woman in particular. She was loyal and loving, hardworking and humble—an ordinary woman who led an ordinary life. Ruth’s ordinary story is much like yours and mine; it bears the fingerprints of an extraordinary God. \n\nJust five verses in, the scene is set for the story, and straightaway you can tell it’s not a happily-ever-after kind of tale. Naomi has lost her husband, a loss with serious implications for a woman in her culture. Then, just ten years later, she loses both of her sons, too. Now, she is a childless widow, with no means for caring for herself or her two surviving daughters-in-law. \n\nThis is a real-life story of real-life suffering. And let’s be honest—doesn’t that bring you a little relief? It is not a story of kings or princes, great leaders or stunning turns of events. This is just the story of a family facing loss, grief, and uncertainty, and the God who cares intimately about it all, every single detail. \n\nLet’s venture into this story set in the very town where Christ would be born. Let’s enter into the life of this unconventional family, ordinary folk God would use to bring about the coming of His kingdom in Christ Jesus. And let’s see what God has to teach us about His faithfulness right here, in our hard and beautiful life. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Ruth 1:6-18, Hosea 2:18-23\n\nI did a terrible thing to my mother-in-law.  \n\nI took her son away. She and my father-in-law were very gracious, and they let him go. I understand that we raise children up to let them go. Indeed, I think few things are more joyful than to see children well-married. But now that I’m a mother of sons, I’ve got my dander up just thinking about some young floozy batting her eyes at my boys.\n\nI’m very fortunate to have a creative, intelligent, and godly mother-in-law. (She might read this, and she’s quite a woman, y’all!) Nevertheless, it’s not a relationship that comes easily. This delicate relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law doesn’t feel like home right away. \n\nRuth’s husband died; her beautiful boy was gone, and with him the tenuous thread that tied her to Naomi was poised to unravel too. Imagine Ruth, Orpah, and Naomi sitting around the metaphorical kitchen table, staring at their hands. Together, but alone, the bonds that held them together seemingly gone. Each wilting under her own personal loss. What happens next? How do we pick up the pieces from this?\n\nRuth chooses Naomi. That’s her next step. It’s so unexpected. She could have stayed in her hometown, with her own people. But no, she said, “Let your people be my people!” (Ruth 1:16). Imagine giving up your home and relocating across the country to live with your mother-in-law. It’s a bold move.\n\nRuth binds herself to her mother-in-law, vowing to do six things with Naomi: travel, dwell, claim her people, worship her God, die where she dies, and be buried where she is buried. Ruth is not messing around. She could have just said, “Okay, let’s go. I’ll check it out and see if it’s for me.” Nope, Ruth was ALL IN.  \n\nThis decision to stay with Naomi is so all-encompassing because it is a decision to follow the God of Israel. God uses this mother-in-law relationship unexpectedly, just as he plants Ruth quite unexpectedly in the genealogy of Christ. He used Naomi to woo Ruth to the one true God. She is in love, not with Naomi’s beauty, riches, or good humor, but her wisdom, virtue, and grace. Naomi preserves these in spite of the huge loss of her husband and sons.\n\nGod was doing a mighty work in Naomi.\nRuth didn’t want her brush with the God of Israel to end.\nSo Ruth clung to Naomi—the one person who linked her to the God of Israel.\n\nWhat kind of God is this who could draw us, against all odds, into what seems like the least comforting of circumstances? He is the God who offers comfort in sorrow, bread in a time of famine, blessing in a season of barrenness, and joy that overcomes all sorrow. He is the God of good news. This is what Ruth saw in Naomi and in Naomi’s God. This is why she joyfully concludes, “Let your God be my God!”\n\n",

Have you ever uttered “pray for me” and meant “pray instead of me, because I just can’t do it”? \n\nIf prayer is a picture of believers lifting one another before the Lord, there are times I have been full-on carried. I don’t mean they’ve just walked alongside me or encouraged me to go on. No, they have picked me up from the pit and held me high before the Lord, my spiritual self limp and lifeless, desperately in need of the life-breath of my Savior. It sounds melodramatic until you’re in the thick of it, too spent to sigh another “please” or “amen.”\n\nThis kind of spiritual and physical exhaustion is what I see when I picture Naomi walking into town that day, so affected by her suffering that she is hardly recognizable. The townswomen whispered to one another, shocked at the condition of the friend they used to know. Naomi quickly set them straight. “It’s over for me,” she said. “Don’t call me Pleasant. Call me Bitter” (Ruth 1:20, my paraphrase).\n\nNaomi’s circumstances were indeed awful. She’d buried her husband, lost two sons, and said goodbye to a daughter-in-law. She had no hope of a grandchild, no path of provision. “I went away full,” she told them, “and the Lord has brought me back empty” (Ruth 1:21). Yet, there was no fist-shaking at heaven. No renouncing her faith. Naomi believed God was sovereign, even in her tragedy. \n\nBut even this believing woman had trouble seeing past her circumstances. The hand was dealt, the credits were rolling. Naomi believed with her head that her God was sovereign, but she was too soul-weary to believe with her heart. And so she called it. Game over. Name changed. \n\nNaomi could not imagine being filled back up. She couldn’t picture her daughter-in-law remarried to an upstanding man who would welcome them both into his family. She couldn’t dream of holding a grandson in her arms. She couldn’t imagine how bitterness could become beauty, but her sovereign God could.\n\nNaomi named herself Bitter, but God names her—and us!—Blessed.\n\nHe names us Forgiven (1 John 1:9).\nHe names us Beloved (Romans 5:8).\nHe names us Redeemed (Ephesians 1:7).\n\nThese names hold true even when circumstances don’t, because ours is a God who is mighty over affliction and blessing, bitterness and beauty, past and future. \n\nThe same woman who walked into her hometown deflated of joy and hope, nevertheless trusted herself and her daughter-in-law to the Lord’s keeping. “Go ahead, my daughter,” Naomi said to Ruth, sending her out into the fields to gather up God’s provision. And provide, He would. Their circumstances were anything but good, but their God was always good. \n\nCircumstances change, but they do not change our God. And they do not change the saving power of Jesus Christ. We need not waste time shaking our fists at heaven when we can run full-force into His arms, trusting He can redeem even us, even this, even now.\n\nWe are not named by our circumstances. We are named by our good God. \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Ruth 2:4-17, Deuteronomy 28:8-9, Psalm 36:7-9\n\nI’m grinning as I sit in the coffee shop typing this. Thankfully, there’s no one at the table facing mine. \n\nI can’t help it. This story is why I can’t get enough of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Because do you know who is declared royalty in the eyes of God? A poor, Moabite widow gleaning barley. I can’t even stand it, I love this story so much.\n\nLet me back up and explain. Here we have our dear Ruth, busting her tail in the barley fields in an honest effort to keep herself and her mother-in-law alive. She “happened” into the field of Boaz. And he “happened” to take notice of her. And (spoiler alert) all these little happenings will end up with Ruth and Boaz at the marriage altar one day, a beautiful ending to an abrupt and terrible life twist. \n\nThe thing is, none of this was happenstance. The hand of a gracious God led Naomi back to Bethlehem and led Ruth to go with her. The hand of a gracious God led Ruth to Boaz’s fields that first day and turned Boaz’s heart toward the hard-working widow from a foreign land. What appeared as coincidence was God’s hand continually at work. \n\nIn the same upside-down way of the gospel, Ruth’s simple and consistent acts of faithfulness have Kingdom-size ramifications. \n\nRuth was not some long-time, super-religious believer who earned herself a spot in God’s capital-S Story (and even in the lineage of Christ!). She was just a young woman doing hard things because she believed it was what she was called to do. We don’t hear this in her words, but we see it in her actions. Her faithfulness is not bright and shiny; her work is not award-winning or perfectly planned. She was simply following God’s lead, taking the next right step.\n\nLike Ruth, we cannot see the whole of our story, let alone His Story. We aren’t meant to. But we can follow God’s lead, knowing that our yeses to Him make a Kingdom-size difference, even when no one sees.\n\nAre you sitting in a quiet apartment this morning, wondering if your next steps matter? Are you driving to an office where you’ll work tirelessly without thanks or appreciation, just like yesterday? Are you settling in for another day at home, serving little hearts in a million unnoticed ways? \n\nHear these words from Boaz to Ruth as my prayer over you today:\n\n“May the Lord reward you for what you have done, and may you receive a full reward from the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge.” – Ruth 2:12\n\nAnd as you do the work set before you, know this: Your small and steady acts of faithfulness are being used in big and beautiful ways in the kingdom of God.  \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Ruth 2:18-23, Deuteronomy 7:7-9, Psalm 41:1-3\n\nTo a kindergartener, riding the bus is no small thing. In fact, riding the bus seems to be the bookend horror of my education—terrifying when I was 6 and mortifying when I was 16. (Thanks again, Mom and Dad.) \n\nWhen I was in kindergarten, the buses weren’t identified by numbers, but by animals. I rode the squirrel bus—not to be confused with the chipmunk bus my best friend rode to her house on the other side of town—and was required to wear a luggage tag flaunting an illustrated picture of the animal on my backpack. \n\nEvery day at 3 pm, the school bell would ring and we’d file outside to our animal-specific location, and every day I remember the same tears, wailing, and resistance. One fellow kindergartener, a curly-haired boy with a blue backpack, was not happy with his assigned position in the bus-zone zoo. “I WANT TO RIDE THE MANATEE BUSSSS!,” he’d wail until his face matched the color of his backpack. \n\nNow, I don’t know if the appeal of this particular bus was the swimming sea cow itself (understandable), a cute passenger with pigtails, or a problem with the squirrel bus he’d been assigned to (also understandable). But one thing was clear: the boy was decidedly discontent. \n\nI may have kept my cool about the squirrel bus, but I, too, become decidedly discontent more often than I’d care to admit. This is especially true when it comes to the love story of Ruth and Boaz. I mean, promise me a Boaz and my single-girl self will run, not walk, to the closest field and gather grain just like Ruth did. That probably wouldn’t work for me, but does that mean God is a better provider to Ruth than He is to me?\n\nWe must decide a few things here: God is either the ultimate Provider, or not at all. He is either in the business of redemption, or He is off the clock altogether. His hand is either strong, or it is weak. He either chose us, or He rejected us. There is no sliding scale according to our worthiness. In fact, His love for us and devotion to us rests on His faithfulness, not ours (Deuteronomy 7:7-9).\n\nNo matter where our feet rest, we are always standing in the field of God’s provision. \n\nI’m reminded of the ways the teachers on bus duty tried to reason with Manatee Boy.  \n\nThey’d say, “That bus isn’t going to take you home, but here’s the one that is!” \n\nThe same is true for us. God’s provision is a vehicle to His perfect will. Maybe unexpected kindness comes to you in the form of a Boaz, or maybe it looks a little different—a new job, a needed friend, a resolved conflict. Either way, our strong Provider is always present, giving His children what they need.\n\nEither way, we’re all headed home.\n\n",

Right?  \n\nNaomi set Ruth up on an incredibly intimate and awkward first date. First of all, she tells Ruth to go to the threshing floor. In the ancient world, the threshing floor was sometimes like the middle school bleachers. In fact, the threshing floor was often a place where folks went to make whoopie (Hosea 9:1).\n\nBut whoopie was far from Naomi’s scheme for Ruth that night. There is no indecency in her set up. Rather, it’s a chaste plan to find Ruth’s kinsman-redeemer (Ruth 2:20). Naomi wants to find a husband for Ruth; she wants Ruth to be at rest. And with the right partner, marriage is rest!\n\nBoaz was a good guy. He was a farmer with weathered face and hands, and on this day he was winnowing. Winnowing means “party time” because it’s the final step in separating the barley from the chaff. The harvest was finally ready, and he and his workers were having a well-earned celebration.\n\nBoaz was a good boss. He worked with the harvesters, then ate and drank and celebrated with them. The boss doesn’t have to get his hands dirty, but great bosses aren’t too proud to serve when they are needed. Then he went to bed at a good hour, so that he was already asleep by midnight. He was all set to be ready for work again the next morning. Oh, Boaz—so responsible!\n\nBoaz was a plain man. He lay out in the barley that night, not because he didn’t have a bed, but to guard his harvest and to be close to work tomorrow. He was a man’s man. \n\nOkay, so are we totally in love with Boaz now?\n\nNaomi sends Ruth to him. And when you put a man and a woman together alone in the dark, it’s a risk, right? But Naomi knew Boaz was sober-minded and Ruth was chaste. Naomi trusted that Boaz would tell Ruth what to do. \n\nOur dear Ruth creeps onto his farm, uncovers his feet and lies down on the hard ground, waiting for Boaz to wake up and acknowledge her. This date is completely terrifying! She could’ve easily doubted the whole thing, wondering, “What if Naomi was wrong? What if Boaz looks at me and recoils in horror? What if he rejects me?”\n\nI imagine her lying there at his feet, watching the stars in their courses, listening to the wind in the barley, and awaiting either her doom or her redemption.\n\nShe calls to him, “I am Ruth, your maiden; take me under your protecting wing” (Ruth 3:9 MSG). And that night Boaz sends her away no less chaste but much happier than when she came. He gives her the promise of marriage and protection.\n\nWe, too, are sometimes on the cold, hard ground of life, putting our reputation at risk, waiting for our redemption. When we lay ourselves at the feet of our Redeemer, He does not recoil in horror. He does not reject us. He looks at us, small and shivering, and gathers us close to Him. He loves us.\n\nCall out to your Redeemer, who waits to take you under His wing. Lay at His feet and bask in your redemption.\n\n",

I have. I often start strong, feeling bold and excited, my heart ready and willing to obey. I can’t help but think, This is it! This is the moment life changes because I said yes! \n\nThen, inevitably, a bend or a bump in the smooth, straight road I envisioned leaves me doubting. But wait. I said yes. I was obedient. So why is this still so hard?\n\nRuth has said all the right yeses in her story. She has been faithful to her mother-in-law Naomi in many ways, but especially so where Boaz is concerned. Ruth has truly put herself out there in trust, and it seems everything has been leading up to this moment. \n\nWhat a surprise it must have been to be told simply to wait—and not for a certain amount of time, but indefinitely. (Indefinite waiting is the worst kind of waiting, if you ask me.) Ruth was instructed to wait until Boaz found the nearer kin, or redeemer, and ask if that man would marry Ruth, per the custom of their culture (Ruth 3:12-13). And who knew how long that would take or what would happen?\n\nWe aren’t told if this frustrated Ruth, but it frustrates me for her. This is the point where I’d likely throw in the towel, caught up in a thought spiral that goes something like this: Well, it’s all over now. I’ll be married to some man I’ve never met, these past few months will have been a total waste, and all I’ll have to show for it is a sore back and some barley. Perfect.\n\nBut Naomi—the same woman who once named herself “Bitter”—offered enough faith for the both of them. She encouraged Ruth, saying, “Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out” (Ruth 3:18).\n\nWait, and then wait again. Isn’t this the way of life? Nowhere are we promised an easy time just because we obey or come to what we believe is a capital-A Answer. But our Father waits too—both with us and for us. His Word says that He longs to be gracious toward us and show us compassion and mercy (Isaiah 30:18). “His steadfast love endures forever,” through all things, all the time, just like the psalm says (Psalm 118).\n\nThis doesn’t mean that things will turn out exactly the way we think they should. But it does mean that God’s hand is always at work in our story, even when we can’t see it. Even when we’re waiting. God’s plan would have still gone ahead of Ruth, even if Boaz came back to say he couldn’t marry her. She would still have been God’s daughter, and His covenant promise to her would still have been true. \n\nIn your waiting place, cling to the hope that God will not leave our stories unfinished or unredeemed. They may not look how we expected but, as with Ruth and Naomi, our story is His story. We can wait with hope, and we can trust and obey with confidence. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

(I say “our Ruth” because we all feel a little bit protective over her at this point, don’t we? Maybe we even see a little of ourselves in her.) And Boaz is pursuing a future with Ruth through the proper channels. He respects the law, and he’s demonstrating over and over again that he is an honorable guy. \n\nBoaz wants this to be legal—for the agreement to be made in plain sight, in the presence of elders. This is a particularly public scene, and it’s a cornerstone in the foundation of the most public scenes in Christian history.\n\nThis narrative almost makes me want to giggle with excitement and nod knowingly. When Boaz fairly and legally earns the right to take Ruth as his wife, the ten elders invoke this awesome, ancient blessing for fruitfulness on their union: “May the Lord make [Ruth] like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you be powerful in Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem” (Ruth 4:11).\n\nYou guys, it’s almost like they knew!\n\nGod reveals a peek at His awesome tapestry when we look at the bigger picture of Boaz and Ruth’s love story. We pull back the curtain and see that Ruth’s decision to follow Naomi was so much more than an address change; it is a tiny piece of God’s grand plan. \n\nThat blessing of fruitfulness would soon bring forth a son, Obed, who would be the father of Jesse. And Jesse’s son was David. (Yep, the guy who slayed Goliath, was anointed king, and wrote many of the Psalms.) David also happens to be the direct ancestor of a baby whose parents returned to their hometown, Bethlehem, to deliver Him in a manger.\n\nJesus. Renowned in Bethlehem, indeed!\n\nRuth and Boaz have an awesome family history of redemption. Even better, through this family tree, the Redeemer—our Redeemer—would come to buy back the world.\n\nChrist has redeemed us like Boaz redeemed Ruth. Their love story is our love story. In the most public way possible, Jesus redeemed us once and for all, a people for His own possession.  \n\nMay we go forward today knowing we are loved so genuinely and so incredibly by the One who redeemed us to be His.\n\nWe are loved, indeed. And we are His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Ruth 4:13-17, Psalm 127, Proverbs 24:27\n\nIsn’t it amazing? In just four chapters, we have seen two women move from overwhelming despair to incredible hope. Remember how Naomi interacted with her friends in the first chapter? “‘Don’t call me Naomi. Call me Mara,’ she answered, ‘for the Almighty has made me very bitter. I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty’” (Ruth 1:20-21).\n\nNow, in chapter four, her friends are surrounding her, praising God for the birth of Ruth and Boaz’s son, Obed, another potential kinsman-redeemer in her family tree. What was empty in Naomi’s life is now full, and her friends declare, “Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you this day without a redeemer” (Ruth 4:14). \n\nIn the midst of trial, I am always tempted to think the opposite of what Naomi’s friends declared—that the Lord has left me, and there will be no redemption to my story. We’ve all been there. You might be there right now. \n\nDuring these times, when I don’t know what the future holds, I often try and plan it out myself. Grasping for a sense of control, I make lists, imagine scenarios, send emails, do whatever I need to do to feel like I’m making progress, to feel like I’m fixing my problems, to feel like I am getting somewhere. This is what I would have done had I found myself in a Ruth-and-Naomi situation: widowed, childless, desperate, and staring at a shaky, unclear future. \n\nThe problem with my go-to method of scrambling and planning is not the plan itself, but rather, the overseer of that plan. Me. \n\nPsalm 127 says that when we are building our own house, our labor is in vain. When we are watching over own city, our watching is in vain. The Lord is the only one who knows the plan and has the power to put it into action. Try as we may, we simply get in the way.\n\nNaomi could not have foreseen the beauty that would come from her story of ashes (Isaiah 61:1-3). What God was building was beyond her predictions and planning. Though she lost her sons and her husband, as her friends reminded her, having Ruth as her daughter-in-law turned out to better than having seven sons (Ruth 4:15). \n\nJust as redemption was in God’s plan for Naomi, so is it in God’s plan for us.\n\nDown the bloodline from Boaz and Ruth and Obed is our Redeemer, Jesus. In Christ, there is no such thing as a story beyond redemption. There is only resurrection, restoration, and rejoicing, even in the most unlikely of circumstances and with the most unlikely of subjects. \n\nIf you’re wondering today if the Lord has left you, and the idea redemption at this point feels impossible, hold fast to the promise we see in Ruth and Naomi’s journey. Nothing is too much, too big, or too scary for our Savior. God has not walked away from you. He’s done the opposite. He has drawn near to you through His Son, Jesus. \n\nToday, let’s take a step back today from whatever it is we are trying to control our way out of. Instead of planning and building, let’s sit in the promise of our Redeemer, believing that God is sovereign and His redemption is already ours.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Ruth 4:18-22, Matthew 1:2-16, Romans 15:12, Luke 3:32-38\n\nHave you ever seen the Bayeux Tapestry? I haven’t seen it in person. It lives in Normandy, France—ooh la la! The tapestry narrates William the Conqueror’s victory at the Battle of Hastings. It’s very famous, very big, and sometimes very beautiful. The top side of it makes sense and tells a story. The underside is a hot mess and looks like the weaver didn’t have a plan.\n\nGod’s will throughout history is like a tapestry. We are underneath looking up, and all the random threads tied in knots and snarls don’t make sense to us. We can’t see the tapestry of history like God sees it. From His perspective it tells the story of His love and plan for mankind from the beginning of time.\n\nOur earthly perspective is limited. So, when God weaves together the family line of Christ, He uses people we would never expect. We assume the line of ancestry for the Son of God would be filled with “respectable” male leaders. But God used women, foreigners, illegitimate children, and a prostitute. (Sidebar: we live in a great world where women can be leaders, but Ruth lived in a world where leaders only looked like serious-faced, respectable men.)\n\nRuth was not only a foreigner; she was from an enemy country, Moab. The Israelites despised the Moabites. So when Ruth walked into town, that’s likely what they saw—a woman with the invisible label of “Moabite” hovering over her head. She herself wasn’t guilty, but she was an easy target for prejudice. And God chose to weave her into His Kingly line. See how the tapestry looks crazy from underneath?\n\nGod makes Ruth an ancestor of David and the Messiah. It is the greatest of  honors. This is the story God was penning all along, from the beginning of the book. \n\nLook at some of the names in Christ’s genealogy:\n\n\u2022 Perez\u2022 Hezron\u2022 Ram\u2022 Amminadab\u2022 Nashon\u2022 Salmon\u2022 Boaz\u2022 Obed\u2022 Jesse\u2022 David\n\nDo you know all the people on that list? I don’t. \n\nThe story of Ruth shows us that there are no insignificant people in God’s plan, even if we only know them as a name on a list. He takes the despised and the rejected, the lowly and the insignificant, even His enemies, and He binds them to Christ. \n\nWhat looks messy and meaningless to us is, from God’s perspective, an intentional and precise way He is working to establish His kingdom. He takes what appear to be loose, broken, and unrelated threads and reveals how He was weaving something eternally beautiful all along.\n\n \n\n",

The sweeping scores are fuel for my fingers on the keyboard, providing a level of focus and intensity I’m not sure I could achieve in silence. \n\nIn the same way that music brings words to life on my computer screen, the books of 1 & 2 Samuel lend new vibrancy to my reading of Scripture. These ancient words were breathed out by God and remain “living and active” (Hebrews 4:12). Even so, I forget. I can read the words yet fail to see the story. \n\nThis is the story of an eternal King and His eternal kingdom. The epic battles and legendary tales found in 1 & 2 Samuel wake me up to a reality that’s as true for me as it was for David: our God reigns. \n\nThe books of 1 & 2 Samuel tell the stories of Samuel, Saul, and David—three broken heroes used by God to establish a kingdom for His people. Samuel was the revered last judge, Saul the impressive first king of Israel, and David the flawed poet-warrior. But beyond the page-turning adventure of kings and battles and political gamesmanship, these books tell the story of a greater King. The life of David, his defeat of Goliath, and the epic victories of his mighty men all point to the coming of Christ—the true and forever-reigning King.\n\nAnd where does it all begin? With the desperate prayers of a heartbroken woman named Hannah. \n\n“Deeply hurt, Hannah prayed to the Lord and wept with many tears. Making a vow, she pleaded, ‘Lord of Armies, if you will take notice of your servant’s affliction, remember and not forget me, and give your servant a son, I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life…’” (1 Samuel 1:10-11).\n\nI read Hannah’s story and I see myself—not because our struggle is the same, but because our hearts are. Like Hannah, I long for what this imperfect life on earth does not give. Like Hannah, I want to be known and remembered by my God. And while all my prayers to Him are not answered with a “yes,” they are heard and I am known. I am remembered. Just like Hannah. \n\n“My heart rejoices in the Lord;\nmy horn is lifted up by the Lord.\nMy mouth boasts over my enemies,\nbecause I rejoice in your salvation” (1 Samuel 2:1).\n\nFirst Samuel begins with a beautiful picture of a heart bowed in earnest before the Lord of all creation, asking for what only He can give. And while all the stories in this study will not be quite so tender, they all point to the same reality. The Lord of Hannah—and Samuel, and Saul, and David, and Israel—is the Lord of you and me. He reigns throughout all generations. \n\nI pray our five weeks in 1 & 2 Samuel bring this truth to life for us as we read, ushering us into the knowledge of the truer kingdom and truest King. In Jesus, God has given us the only King who can satisfy our desire for protection, provision, and peace—a King whose throne cannot be defeated.\n\nOur King and His kingdom are forever. Thanks be to God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 3:1-21, 1 Samuel 4:1-22, Psalm 78:58-66, Acts 4:23-31\n\nCalling is rarely simple. I know this from my own life, but I’ve observed it in the lives of others as well. \n\nSeveral years ago, I sat down with women from several different seminaries to ask them why they were going into ministry. These interviews were part of my doctoral research in which I explored the experiences of women and personal calling. For most, their stories were complicated and full of self-doubt. Their calling didn’t necessarily make sense to them. It was a huge risk or a financial sacrifice. As a result, some had resisted the call, while others had rejected it outright. But for nearly all of them, their story of calling was neither simple nor clear.\n\nToo often, we assume calling is straightforward. If it’s really from God, there shouldn’t be any confusion, right? And yet, most biblical stories of calling are complex. Samuel’s is no exception. Three times the Lord called Samuel, and three times Samuel failed to recognize God’s voice. It was the fourth time, and only after receiving wise counsel from Eli, that Samuel finally came to recognize and answer the voice of the Caller (1 Samuel 3:10).\n\nThis is tremendously comforting to all of us who are discerning a call. After all, Samuel heard the literal voice of God, and still he was confused! This tells me that uncertainty, fear, and doubt do not negate the validity of a calling. Instead, they are the norm. In Scripture, nearly every person called by God for a task initially felt afraid, unqualified, or unprepared for the task. Few are the stories of confident leaders who trusted God without pause.\n\nSo, how do we discern God’s calling when it’s unclear? In their  commentary on 1 & 2 Samuel, J.D. Greear and Heath Thomas highlight four key obstacles to discernment: inexperience, expectation, unwillingness, and sin. Samuel was inhibited by the first two; he didn’t know the voice of God, and he wasn’t expecting to hear it. For some of us, it’s our own sin that blinds us; we’re too committed to our own security and comfort.\n\nNo matter the obstacle, Samuel’s story points to one great help in our discernment: wise counsel. Without Eli, Samuel might’ve circled the house twenty times that night, hearing the call but never recognizing it. Thankfully, Eli explained what was happening. Not only did he recognize God’s voice and know His ways, but he also named Samuel’s calling and instructed him on how to respond.\n\nThe women I interviewed reported similar counsel from pastors, parents, mentors and friends—individuals who were able to help them name their gifts, pointed them to Scripture, and encouraged them to boldly trust God. This is a blueprint for us all: it’s always best to discern God’s leading in the context of Christian community.\n\nThe good news is, our God is a pursuer. Over and over again, He called out to Samuel, and He does the same with us. God repeatedly beckons us in big and small ways until we hear and respond to Him. And all the while, He sends us the help of His Church, His Word, and His Spirit as guides. He does all this because no one is more committed to our God-given calling than the One who issues the call.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 5:1-12, 1 Samuel 6:1-21, Exodus 10:1-2, Leviticus 5:14-17\n\nI imagine the cassette tape is the kind of thing that will make my grandchildren’s eyes grow wide. They will giggle at these long gone, barely imaginable pieces of technology that have been replaced by something that is faster, smarter, and better. It will be to them what my own grandparents’ stories of their first radios and 45 records were to me.\n\nI could tell them how my brother and I used to make recordings of our favorite songs when they came on the radio, one of us pressing play on our tape recorder at exactly the right moment while we sat there, silent and completely still, for the entirety of the song. Despite our best efforts, these recordings always seemed to consist of muffled versions of our favorite tunes, featuring the sounds of our breathing and restless fidgeting. \n\nOur most beloved cassette tape not only included the theme from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but also the static of the television we recorded it from. We could never seem to get it right, but at the time, it was worth it for the chance to carry our favorite tunes with us, playing them over and over again.\n\nI can’t read about the Philistines carrying the ark with them without getting that same theme song stuck in my head. Of course, I could now easily pull the song up online to hear the track clearly and without distraction, but I like my crackly, static version just fine.\n\nIf I’m honest, I’m still easily persuaded that I can break God and His glory down into “good enough” pieces of religious comfort—pieces I can carry with me. The Philistines seemed to think this, too. The problem is, we’re not the ones in charge of the carrying.\n\nThe ark, roughly four feet long, was gold-plated and carried on poles that hung through rings on its sides. It was holy, created to house the tablets of the Ten Commandments and serve as a representation of God’s covenant with His people. As we read these passages together, we can all agree that things get pretty weird, right? Dagon, Ashdod’s idol-god, falls onto the ark, and then the city is afflicted with tumors (1 Samuel 5:6). Somewhere along the way, the Philistines began to believe they could move the ark however they pleased, that all of God’s goodness could be contained in a four-foot-long box.\n\nI wonder what kind of boxes we carry with us today. Maybe it’s containing God to a specific place or restricting His character to the confines of our own small experiences. Perhaps the problem is that we’re stuffing the box with selfish pride and hopeful gain but still calling it God’s will.\n\nRegardless, our boxes are all our own cheap versions of the one true Father, muffled by our sin and covered in the static of our humanity. Let us not mistake them for the substance of the Spirit. If we choose to carry anything with us let it be the full arc of the gospel story. Even better, let’s remember that we are the ones who need to be carried.\n\nThat’s what Jesus does for us. He carries us into the very presence of our God, in all His holiness. When the question is asked, “Who is able to stand in the presence of the Lord this holy God?” (1 Samuel 6:20), we can trust that Jesus has made a way for us to do just that. He stood in our place and died the death we deserved so that we could approach our holy God with confidence (Ephesians 3:12).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 7:1-17, 1 Samuel 8:1-22, Proverbs 1:29-33, Hebrews 1:1-3\n\nIn 1 Samuel 8, we find Israel rejecting their God, the One who rescued them from slavery, provided for them in the desert, and gave them victory over their enemies.\n\nIsrael instead demanded a king who would judge them, go before them, and fight their battles (1 Samuel 8:20). Ironically, the King they rejected was the only king to fulfill this request. God had already been their Judge (Deuteronomy 32:36), gone out before them (Exodus 13:21), and fought their battles (Exodus 14:14).\n\nBut they wanted a king “the same as all the other nations” (1 Samuel 8:5). So they rejected their true King, the God of heaven and earth. God granted their request and gave them over to their desires, but not without a warning. He promised to give them a king like all the other nations. He would give them one who was selfish, oppressive, and ruthless. They didn’t heed His warning.\n\nI want to be like everyone else, too. I want to look like everyone else, to be both beautiful and adorable, and so I make my appearance king. Then I find myself overcome by my obsessive eating habits and exercise routine. Turns out that king won’t provide what I need.\n\nI want to have what everyone else has, to feel important and sophisticated, and so I make my possessions king. I spend my time, money, and energy, filling my closet with pretty new dresses. But I’ll never have enough because this king demands more and more and more.\n\nI could go on, and I’m sure you could, too. \n\nOur individual kings demand more from us than we’d ever be willing to give. They lie and tell us that if we could have what the world has, we would have freedom. \n\nSecond Peter 2:19 warns against this:\n\n“They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption, since people are enslaved to whatever defeats them.”\n\nThis is what happens when we, like Israel, fall prey to the desire of being like everyone else. Instead of gaining freedom, we become slaves of corruption. When we turn from the wisdom of the Lord and His ways, we “will eat the fruit of [our] way” (Proverbs 1:29-33). In our efforts to be like the world, we miss out on what we truly need: freedom that can only come from submitting ourselves to the true King, Jesus Christ.\n\nBut God is rich in mercy. He pursues us and draws us to Himself until we long for Him again (1 Samuel 7:2,6). He even works through our rebellion, just as He did with Israel, providing what is truly best for us. God would later appoint David as king over Israel, and through his family, provide the true King in Jesus Christ. He is the One who ultimately goes before us and fights our battles (Revelation 19:11-16). He is all we need, and only in submitting to Him as King will we find freedom instead of slavery (Luke 4:18).\n\n",

Ten years ago, my husband took a shine to cycling. Bicycling. He hadn’t engaged in the sport before, but he knew how to ride a bike. And since riding a bike is literally a metaphor for something you can never forget, how could I possibly find a flaw in his plan? \n\nAs he researched the sport, he decided he needed vintage cycling jerseys. (I understand his wanting to look like an Italian racecar driver from the ‘40s. It’s a great look.) During these years we were poor school teachers, eating pasta for every meal. Extra purchases hurt us right in the grocery budget, but nevertheless, vintage cycling jerseys were purchased.\n\nWhen these gorgeous, fabled items arrived in the mail, we admired their magisterial purples and heraldic sables. But what came next, gentle reader, is what pains me the very most: he never wore them. It turns out my husband loves neither cycling nor the wearing of spandex-y garments. But since we shelled out so much money for them, we’ve held on to them for three moves. To this day, they remain stashed away in our attic, still in their original packaging. \n\nWe just had to have them. But we didn’t need them!\n\nIsrael asked for something they didn’t need: a king. They started looking around at their neighbors—the Philistines, Moabites, and the Ammonites—for a model of how they wanted to live. They wanted a king like all the other nations, but their misplaced trust in an earthly king was a foolish rejection of God. Israel were His chosen people; He didn’t want them to live like the rest of the world. But they insisted on getting their own way, and He gave them exactly what they asked for.\n\nSaul was a flashy, handsome guy who was physically “impressive” (1 Samuel 9:2), but spiritually dull and cowardly (1 Samuel 10:22). Of course, our inclination in reading this passage is to focus on Saul, just like Israel did. But the impressive and miraculous signs, even his prophesying, ultimately do not point to Saul’s fitness, but God’s.\n\nWhen those wicked men asked, “How can this guy save us?” they were doubling down on their doubt of God’s provision (1 Samuel 10:27). They wanted a king, so God gave them Saul—a man literally head and shoulders above all the rest in Israel—to rule over them. When he shows up, they still doubt. Ironically, this doubting of God’s provision would later be Saul’s undoing as well.\n\nWherever the Spirit of the Lord is at work, we ought never doubt of God’s provision. But if God’s Spirit does not lead the way, we ought not go forth. The real importance of this passage is simply this: God works His mercies by His Spirit, even amongst a rebellious people.\n\nThis theme should be familiar, because the real story of God’s Anointed One is not about Saul. Saul’s kingship was an ironic foreshadowing of the true Anointed One, Christ. May our hearts seek first His kingdom. May we look to Him to provide us with what we truly need, rather than trying to build a kingdom of our own making.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kim Cash Tate\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 11:1-15, 1 Samuel 12:1-25, Isaiah 5:8-12, Micah 6:1-5\n\nI still vividly recall my third year of law school, when graduation neared and I had no offer of employment. The plan had been to work at a Washington, D.C., law firm during the second summer and, by the end of my time there, secure a permanent offer to return upon graduation. But the firm suffered a financial downturn and could extend only two offers. (Another firm I’d turned down extended more than twenty.) Stressed out and covered in hives, I was sure I’d be forever unemployed.\n\nPlease, let me get this position. My heart uttered those words with every resume sent, every interview secured. Still, the rejections piled up. Then, one week before graduation, my resume found its way to the desk of a federal judge in Madison, Wisconsin. She conducted a phone interview, flew me out for a face-to-face, and offered a clerkship on the spot. It was one of the best jobs I could’ve gotten. And oh, how I celebrated, calling it as a blessing. \n\nA month later, my fiancé and I ventured to Madison to begin our careers. We rented an apartment and moved in together. I didn’t know the Lord at the time. I wanted His blessings, but I didn’t want Him as Lord and King over my life.\n\nSuch was the state of affairs in Israel during the latter part of Samuel’s time as judge. The people asked for a king to reign over them “like all the nations” (1 Samuel 8:5), thus rejecting God as King. They got what they asked for. God chose Saul to be their king, and, empowered by His Spirit, Saul led the people to a great victory against the Ammonites. And oh, how they celebrated. They had their king! They had victory over the enemy!\n\nWith such immense blessings, they surely felt all was well. Don’t we tend to think the same?  When we’re being blessed—especially if we’ve received the very thing we asked for—we don’t see “warning” flags. To the contrary, we feel good about ourselves and our situation, perhaps even about our relationship with God. After all, we must be doing something right in order for God to bless us, right?\n\nBut blessings have more to do with God than with us. They reflect His amazing grace and His long-suffering character. They flow from His lovingkindness and goodness. “For He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous” (Matthew 5:45). \n\nIn the midst of great blessing, our hearts can still be far from God. And apart from Him, blessings are merely temporal and empty.\n\nGod was gracious in pointing this out to the people of Israel. Through the prophet Samuel, He interrupted their revelry to remind them that they had rejected Him and to point to where true prosperity lay. \n\n“If you fear the Lord, worship and obey him, and if you don’t rebel against the Lord’s command, then both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the Lord your God.” (1 Samuel 12:14)\n\nMadison ended up being the place where I met the Lord, where He drew me to Himself and saved me. That was the true blessing—the greatest blessing. Now, when I think of that time, I’m reminded that no matter what is happening outwardly in our lives, whether hardships or joy, the true measure of our well-being is in the posture of our hearts before God. The ultimate blessing is in following Him and allowing Him to reign as King over our lives.\n\n",

Mostly I doubted my ability to do the job well—and our kids were only in first grade and pre-K. But despite my initial doubts, those early years turned out to be fruitful in numerous ways, not only for them, but for our family as a whole. \n\nStill, imagine my angst when high school neared. Yes, God had been faithful, but this was the big leagues now. The stakes were higher, and my own inadequacies might hamper their options for the future. Yet, as I write, our youngest has graduated from our homeschool and will be joining her brother at a wonderful university. Once again, God showed Himself faithful throughout the high school journey.\n\nMy propensity to stick with safety and comfort has reached well beyond homeschooling. Whenever I’ve sensed God’s call to embrace a new challenge, I’m never short on reasons why it won’t work. Or why I can’t do it. Or why I might be hearing God wrong altogether. In truth, I can identify with the King Saul we see in 1 Samuel 13 and 14.\n\nThough Saul had been given the Spirit of God, and had once called men valiantly to battle, his courage was diminished. The Philistines were an ever-present threat, occupying territory in Israel, and Saul seemed content to lay low. Perhaps if the Israelites didn’t kick up any dust and cause trouble, the Philistines would leave them be. Despite the power God had made available to him, Saul took to playing it safe.\n\nIn stark contrast, his son Jonathan embraced the challenge. Though the Philistines were superior in number and in weaponry, Jonathan went after them with just one other man. He said, “Come on, let’s cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps the Lord will help us. Nothing can keep the Lord from saving, whether by many or by few” (1 Samuel 14:6).\n\nWho puts themselves in a position to see God fight for them? Whose trust is that deep? God rewarded Jonathan’s faith, causing several Philistine men to fall and sending an earthquake that caused trembling in the camp.\n\nWhat stops us from trusting like that? As believers in Christ, we are indwelled by the Spirit of God, His infinite power and might. We are armed with the promises of God, among them being His promise to be with us, His promise to establish His purposes in our lives, and His promise to be faithful, always. We are assured that we have nothing to fear—and indeed, no matter what we may endure, it can’t compare to the “eternal weight of glory” to come (2 Corinthians 4:17).\n\nBiblical accounts such as Jonathan’s serve to stir up our faith and courage in Christ. Like Jonathan, we can believe God. We can embrace the challenges to which we are called. And we can witness God’s powerful hand at work.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 15:1-35, 1 Samuel 16:1-23, Ruth 4:18-22, Luke 6:45\n\nAbout the time my future groom and I started looking at rings, a story circulated through my college dorm that put many of us hopeful brides-to-be on high alert. Whether true or simply an urban legend, I can’t say. But long after my now-husband popped the question, the story has stuck with me. It goes like this…\n\nA handsome young man decided to propose to a beautiful girl. He told her that since they were poor college kids, he could not afford much of a ring. He proposed with a small cubic zirconia, a manufactured replacement for a real diamond. But secretly, he purchased a beautiful, expensive, whopper of a diamond and planned to have it put in the setting for their wedding day. But when the blushing bride-to-be discovered her ring was a fake, she demanded the real thing. The groom was so turned off by her shallow behavior that he broke off the engagement. Only then did the girl learn that he’d planned all along to take her breath away with a real diamond.\n\nIn 1 Samuel, we find a similar tale of fake worth and diamonds in the rough. Saul had been anointed as the first king of Israel. He seemed to have it all, but it didn’t take long for his façade to crack. Saul was deeply flawed. His dependence on the Lord turned out to be counterfeit, and in 1 Samuel 15, the Lord rejected Saul as king of Israel.\n\nIsrael’s prophet, Samuel, was grieved by Saul’s failings. I imagine he might have felt like that bride-to-be, who thought her boyfriend had bought her a diamond only to discover she’d been given a chunk of glass. But God was like the groom with something better tucked away. Despite Israel’s long history of doubting God, He planned to replace Saul with a king so good he’d become the measuring stick for all other kings to come.\n\nAt the Lord’s prompting, Samuel went to the house of Jesse looking for a new king. Jesse had  eight sons and he paraded all but the youngest in front of Samuel. Each time, the Lord said “no.” Samuel was baffled by God’s rejection of such strong, capable men. God’s explanation put a magnifying glass over Samuel’s heart.\n\n“But the Lᴏʀᴅ said to Samuel, ‘Do not look at his appearance or his stature, because I have rejected him. Humans do not see what the Lᴏʀᴅ sees, for humans see what is visible, but the Lᴏʀᴅ sees the heart.’” (1 Samuel 16:7)\n\nDavid didn’t look like a king. His father thought so little of him that he didn’t even bring him in from the field. But God chose him. Beneath an unimpressive exterior, God saw treasures in David’s heart. \n\nWe can’t polish ourselves pretty enough to create our own worth. But God mines for value in each of our hearts.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 17:1-58, Ephesians 6:12, Hebrews 2:14-18\n\nWe recently celebrated our 5th birthday here at She Reads Truth, and I’ve been feeling nostalgic about the early days. Thinking back over the years, I can remember a lot of mistakes I’ve made, not to mention the mistakes I made today. Seriously, I don’t seem to be able to make it though one day without putting my foot in my mouth just a little bit.\n\nBut I have learned so much, and there is one simple thing for which I am most grateful: I have learned about the Bible. The more I read, the more I’m able to make connections and see the echoes of one passage in another. More than the research and the commentaries, the focused act of reading my Bible has given me confident hope for the future.\n\nI have learned that my own resolutions to achieve and do better will absolutely come to nothing. I know that all good things come by the power of God’s grace, not the resolve of my earnest soul. I’ve learned that fear and worry serve no purpose in God’s economy. And another great perk of knowing your Bible is knowing what God has promised.\n\nThis is exactly where David was when he heard that Goliath the Philistine was threatening the troops of Israel. He was just totally outraged that no one had taken up the challenge because he knew that God had already promised to preserve and protect Israel. Not only that, but God had already delivered the giants into Israel’s hands before: when Abraham conquered Chedorlaomer (Genesis 14), and when Israel entered the land of promise (Numbers 13:17-33). \n\nDavid knew God’s covenant promises to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. He’d heard the stories of God’s amazing protection over Noah and his family. And he’d read the heroic tales of Joshua’s obedience to God. He knew, most of all, that God is faithful, and that He cannot be mocked (Galatians 6:7).\n\nDavid knew his Bible. He knew God’s promises. So when he was confronted with a threatening Philistine giant, he said, “ Today, the LORD will hand you over to me” (1 Samuel 17:46). Those sound like brave words if you don’t know the end of the story. But the pattern of redemption is always the same: the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain… but the Lord is enthroned in heaven (Psalm 2). The Bible tells us we will always have troubles, but Jesus is the hero and He always slays the dragon in the end.\n\nKnow His Word. Know who God is. Remember the history of His providence. Lay hold of His unfailing promises. David wasn’t doing anything new, but he was a man who knew his Bible.\n\nI don’t know that I’m ready to face any giants, but knowing God’s Word and His promises were exactly the foundation for David’s confidence before Goliath. It wasn’t his sling and stones, or his history of bear-fighting. It was simply God’s Word.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 18:1-30, 1 Samuel 19:1-24, Psalm 59:1-17\n\nIt all started with pride and a hankering for toast.\n\nWith a freshly ironed shirt and crisp college degree, I walked through the doors of my new job and stepped into a schedule full of meetings and a to-do list of fires to put out. Literally.\n\nSoon after becoming acquainted with the office kitchen and its various coffee creamers and water bottles, I found myself staring into a tiny toaster smelling very burnt toast. The piece of bread was mine, of course, but its transformation into unrecognizable burnt crumbles made me feel as if I had no business being near baked goods of any kind, ever. I looked around the empty room, wondering when the toast’s lunatic owner, ahem, would rescue it from the smoke-producing heat.\n\nI regularly find myself feeling neglectful like this in the kitchen, but I can also be careless with my thought life too. Envy starts a fire in my heart, causing my feelings to combust from the inside out. From seemingly nowhere, jealousy rears its ugly head, just in time for me to realize these terrible thoughts are unfortunately, actually mine (all mine!)—unlike my friend’s new engagement ring, vacation plans, promotion, or instagram attention, which caused my emotions to boil over in the first place. I truly want to celebrate these things for my friend (I do!), but turning away from my good intentions for even five seconds leaves these feelings to roast unattended over an open flame.\n\nEnvy might be the only sin that never feels good, not even for a moment. Other sins give us fleeting pleasure or empty promises, but envy hands us a box of matches and permission to light the fire. And before we know it, we’re in a room full of smoke.\n\nIn 1 Samuel 18, there’s a friendly celebration happening, the kind we intend to give the people we love as a way to congratulate them. Saul is great! David is great! We all have tambourines! But envy creeps into Saul’s heart when he hears, “Saul has killed his thousands, but David his tens of thousands” (v.7, emphasis mine).\n\nThe matches are lit, and Saul is off to kill David. That escalated quickly, didn’t it? I’m not sure Saul even knows how he got there, but then I remember my own failed attempts to rescue bread from the kitchen toaster. (I grabbed a paper towel to smother the flames, which of course, actually made them worse.) So, I can understand why Saul would want to get rid of any evidence pointing directly to his failures. \n\nI’ll bet Saul had one word ringing in his head that may sound familiar to you and me: mine. He wanted to claim it all as his—the glory, the credit, the recognition, the love. (Can anyone else relate?)\n\nAlthough David seemed to have it all together, he only had one quality worth envying: the presence of the One who actually does hold it all together. In these two chapters, we see the phrase “God with David” four times. This is what sets David apart. This is what Saul wants. This is what we all want. Our cries may say “Mine!,” but all we ever really want is for Someone to choose us, to adopt us as their own.\n\nThe glory, the credit, the recognition, the love—they’re all the Lord’s. And friends, so are we. He smothers the flames of envy by showing us we already belong. After all, it all started with love and a hankering for home.\n\n“You are my strength, I sing praise to you;\n you, God, are my fortress,\nmy God on whom I can rely.”\n-Psalm 59:17\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kim Thomas\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 20:1-42, 1 Samuel 21:1-15, 1 Samuel 22:1-23, Psalm 34:1-3, Matthew 10:34-39\n\nI don’t know if it’s because I’m the daughter of a Navy Captain, or because my heart beats to the rhythm of the tides, but I feel most settled at the ocean. Recently, on an early morning walk, I remembered a line from a poem I wrote in sixth grade: “the waves jump up and hit my face / in and out, like fancy lace…” Relentless and submissive, joyful and with full abandon, the waves come and serve themselves to the shore. They do not pause several hundred feet out to decide whether or not they should move forward.\n\nIf only making decisions came so easily for me.\n\nGranted, it’s their ontological design, so there’s that. But I still long for a simple, clear confidence of direction when making difficult decisions—especially relational ones that cause me to choose one loyalty over another. Or when things are simply inconvenient and I know the consequences will be costly. I confess I find it easier to hover out from the shore rather than risk crashing on the wrong one.\n\nI admire the clarity of mind Jonathan displays in 1 Samuel. Early on, he’s presented with a tangled, messy, relational situation, yet Jonathan honors his commitment to David without hesitation, promising, “Whatever you say, I will do for you” (1 Samuel 20:4). Boom. I can almost hear the splash and feel the spray on my face.\n\nIn that split second, Jonathan has committed to protect his friend David from his own father, King Saul. In doing so, he helps to preserve a kingship, which ultimately results in the Messiah’s arrival and our own salvation rescue. Jonathan couldn’t have known the long-range significance in the moment, or what the ultimate cost of such a commitment would be (1 Samuel 31). But he did know the next right thing to do, and he did it with moral clarity and a clear conscience.\n\nMy decisions aren’t usually life-and-death, and the accompanying narrative is not nearly as dramatic. But when it comes to decision-making in my own life,  I’ve experienced the tension between relational loyalties and moral clarity in more ways than I can count.\n\nTake the other night—a somewhat trivial, but practical example. We were sitting in our courtyard, as our neighbor’s two small dogs continued to bark… at 11 o’clock… pm.\n\nIt’s not a new issue for us; there have been conversations, requests, and reminders. We could’ve very easily called the police to come issue a citation. It would even be morally appropriate to do so. But I happen to know our neighbor is an older, divorced woman who lives alone, and those two dogs are her family. I also know she would nearly die if the police showed up at her door. So after hesitating for about 20 minutes, I texted her a kind but firm request that she bring her dogs inside since it was so late. She did, and the next day she sent me a heartfelt text of apology.\n\nLong-range significance? I’m not sure, except that she knows we pastor a church and pray for her regularly. But I do know it’s better to extend grace and compassion—overlooking my own temporary inconvenience—rather than risk whatever potential kingdom fruit may come from our relationship.\n\nMany decisions cost far more than this small disturbance in our neighborhood. But even in the small things, God is teaching me about His presence in all things. When my choices are guided by what will bring glory to God and grow fruit for His kingdom, the decisions come more easily, and with quicker clarity. As Jesus Himself tells His disciples in the last part of Matthew 10:39, whenever we lose our life for His sake, we will find it in Him.\n\nPerhaps there is a rhythm to be found here yet—like the waves.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 23:1-29, 1 Samuel 24:1-22, Psalm 54:1-7, John 19:10-11\n\nWhen righteous young David has the chance to take out paranoid, egotistical, narcissistic Saul twice and doesn’t do it, part of me wants to throw my hands up in frustration. That’s not how the story should go! The hero is supposed to seize his opportunity to conquer his enemy, then ride off into the sunset as the credits roll.\n\nInstead, David’s anti-climactic showdown with Saul reminds us who the real Hero is. In 1 Samuel 24, David and a small army of followers are on the run. Saul and an army of 3,000 soldiers are hunting David with the goal to kill him.  \n\nIn an ironic, almost comical twist, the paranoid king decides to relieve himself in the very cave where David and his men were hiding. If I’d been in David’s squad, I would’ve joined their rallying cry.\n\n“Look, this is the day the Lᴏʀᴅ told you about: ‘I will hand your enemy over to you so you can do to him whatever you desire’” (1 Samuel 24:4).\n\nTake your shot! He’s got it coming! Eliminate the threat! Instead, David sneaks up behind his archenemy and cuts off the corner of his robe.\n\nWait. What?\n\nDavid had already been anointed king, and clearly, Saul was no good for God’s people—his thirst for David’s blood was insatiable. So why then, does David opt to take a piece of Saul’s robe, as opposed to a piece of the man himself?\n\nHow could David be so bridled in the face of an enemy so bent on his destruction? It wasn’t that David didn’t crave relief from his enemy. He hadn’t assumed a position of defeat. He knew the battle ultimately belonged to the Lord.\n\nAt the mouth of the cave, David said these words to Saul:\n\n“May the Lᴏʀᴅ judge between me and you, and may the Lᴏʀᴅ take vengeance on you for me, but my hand will never be against you” (1 Samuel 24:12).\n\nWe don’t have to seek revenge or take out our enemies. David’s defender is our defender. When we find ourselves face to face with a threat, our Father’s advice is to respond with kindness and let Him do what He will (Proverbs 25:21-22). \n\nDavid’s restraint helps us grasp the big picture. If we widen the lens, we can see that the Lord has disarmed our ultimate enemy. God alone is the ultimate Authority and Judge in this world and the world to come (John 19:10-11). \n\nSo we don’t have to head into every fight with fists clenched. We don’t have to be the judge and jury in our search for justice. David’s defender is fighting for us. He is our helper, the sustainer of our lives, and our rescuer in every situation (Psalm 54:4,7). The battle belongs to the Lord!\n\n",

So I’m in dangerous territory from the start when it comes to her. And this year at school she shared a class with the prettiest, pinkest little bully I’ve ever seen. Every time a report came home of another petty injustice, I wanted to rise up and bring my considerable adult authority to the situation. My heart longs to exact vengeance on my own terms. And while there is certainly a place to stand up for what is right, vengeance enacted by me shouting at little girls just can’t be the answer.\n\nWe are inclined to take matters into our own hands, to avenge ourselves on others. In David’s case, it seems like David had every right to avenge himself. Nabal was a total fool (I mean, his name literally means “fool”) who had actually profited by the protection of David’s men, but who thanklessly despised his own protector. Not only this, but then his contempt for David and his men was expressed by uncontrollably raging at them. Sure of his own self-worth, greedy of his own possessions, he failed to acknowledge God’s gracious provision in David, his protector.\n\nWho could blame David for wanting to take vengeance? He was, after all, the Lord’s anointed. Surely he deserved at least civil treatment from Nabal. He had the manpower with him to attack and destroy Nabal and his family for the slight. But regardless of whether others deserve vengeance, it is not ours to mete out. Remember this uncomfortable, yet comforting verse: “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord” (Romans 12:19)?\n\nGod prevented David from sin through Abigail’s humility and discernment. She knew better than David her own husband’s perpetual folly, yet sought not her own ends, nor vengeance, nor the interests of any one person. Rather, she humbly defended a fool, courageously confronted a vengeful warrior, in order to keep all from evil. “May evil not be found in you,” she said to David (1 Samuel 25:28). Abigail’s words echo the righteous desire of God’s own heart, that His people walk in righteousness, seeking His glory above their own, and trusting all manners to His care.\n\nWhen David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the LORD who championed my cause against Nabal’s insults and restrained his servant from doing evil. The LORD brought Nabal’s evil deeds back on his own head” (1 Samuel 25:39).\n\nDavid was stopped that day from a folly equal to Nabal’s: that of assuming that our own good is in our own hands. But ultimately, David understood that only God is his defender (1 Samuel 26:10-11; 2 Samuel 1:14-15; 4:12).\n\nBlessed be the Lord! He alone is our sure defense, not only against the offenses made against us, but also from the folly from within our own hearts. Rest in His provision.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 28:1-25, 1 Samuel 29:1-11, Deuteronomy 18:10-12, Proverbs 1:28\n\nOne frigid winter evening when my husband was still in grad school, I tried to call him. He had been out with friends after finishing finals, while I was already home for Christmas, several states away. When he didn’t answer his phone around 9pm, I wasn’t too worried. I called again an hour or so later, just before I went to bed, and he still didn’t answer. Then I sent off a few texts, each more worried than the last, hoping he would respond. \n\nI darted in and out of sleep, checking my phone, calling, and texting, until about 4am, when he finally texted me back to say he had fallen asleep well before 9:00—the hard, deep sleep of a post-finals student who had forgotten to charge his mobile phone, rendering it useless. And while we were quickly able to laugh about it, I can still feel my heart racing when I think about how I felt that night, several states away, not able to get in touch with him for hours. I would’ve done anything for an answer, for the assurance that he was okay.\n\nSaul is in a frantic panic in 1 Samuel 28. He knows the Philistines are ready to fight at Mount Gilboa. He knows God has rejected him as king (1 Samuel 15:23). He knows Samuel is dead—Samuel, who had been with him since his anointing, who’d walked with him and guided him in the ways of the Lord. Desperate for answers, Saul has sought the Lord about how he should face the Philistines. But the Lord is silent because He’s rejected Saul, leaving him to feel very, very alone.\n\nAnd so Saul, the warrior king who’d chosen his own pride over the Lord so many times before, again seeks his own comfort and control first. He consults a medium—after declaring all mediums illegal and sending them out of Israel—for the answer he so desperately needs. He asks her to bring forth Samuel, who appears and tells Saul that he and his sons will die in the next day’s battle. \n\nI can hardly breathe if I put myself in Saul’s shoes. The desperation he must’ve felt before visiting the medium would have been silenced by that cold truth. He would lose the battle. He would no longer be king, nor would his sons inherit the throne. The years of turning away from the Lord and seeking his own glory had left him there, alone. \n\nWhen I think about how often I obsess over the future—running worst-case scenarios through my head, working myself into a panic—I realize that I’m tempted in the same ways Saul was. It’s so much easier to take matters into my own hands, to live for my own glory, and to forget about the Lord’s steadfast faithfulness. Perhaps if Saul had reflected on how faithful the Lord had been to the people of Israel, he would’ve trusted the Lord for one more day. \n\nSo the cup I have to drink today is the cup of the Lord’s faithfulness. It is to choose trust and faith over fear and control. It is to recite to myself the promise Moses made to Joshua in Deuteronomy 31:8:\n\n“The Lord is the one who will go before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or abandon you. Do not be afraid or discouraged.”\n\nThe Lord goes before me. He knows and numbers my days. And I have confidence through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus that God always keeps His promises. I may not face Philistines in battle, but I will face temptation, fear, and death as surely as Saul did. And so I pray that an unshakable confidence in Christ will be my only and blessed assurance each day.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 1 Samuel 30:1-31, 1 Samuel 31:1-13, Psalm 56:3-4, Luke 4:18-19\n\nYesterday we read about Saul’s moment of desperation. He knew he was facing a mighty battle against the Philistines, and he knew he was facing them alone. He was without Samuel, and he was without the Lord, who had turned away from him after his repeated disobedience. And Saul, who must have been near-crazed with fear, broke his own laws and the law of God by consulting a medium to try to find an answer. \n\nToday, we read about David in a similar situation. The Amalekites had raided the city of Ziklag, burned it, and captured all of the women and children. David and his army returned to Ziklag, but there was nothing left. In fact, they “wept loudly until they had no strength left to weep” (1 Samuel 30:4). That sentence strikes the deepest fear into my own heart, which is rather predisposed to fear and anxiety. I can’t imagine that kind of pain. \n\nAnd yet David responds with faith. Even though his wives have been captured, his city burned, and his army is threatening to rise up against him to stone him to death—David responds with faith. David is facing a loneliness and uncertainty perhaps even greater than Saul’s before the battle at Mount Gilboa. David has let his people down, the very people God has entrusted him to lead. But 1 Samuel 30:6 tells us, “David found strength in the Lord his God.” \n\nI am humbled by David in this passage. I am convicted by Saul’s impatience and need to control, but I am humbled and inspired by David’s faith and his generosity. His response to trial was to trust the Lord. And his response to great victory was to praise the Lord and share the spoils. David, who knew he would be king, claimed no victory outside of the Lord’s faithfulness. \n\nEven when I do choose the way of David—fragile yet desperately leaning on the Lord because I know only He can sustain me—I often forget His faithfulness when my moment of trial has passed. It is only when I intentionally take time to reflect on the Lord’s guiding, preserving hand that I remember to give thanks and to testify to His goodness. \n\nMy prayer today is not only to carry with me the confidence of faith, but to remember to testify to the Lord’s great faithfulness in my life. I can testify to His glory through my worship, His presence through my prayers, and His mercy through my actions toward others. I can testify to His grace in my quickness to forgive and His provision when I am generous. \n\nDavid’s actions remind me to not only rely on the Lord daily, but to also tell of His great deeds. When I live with gratitude in response to Christ’s love for me, I testify to the gift of His sacrifice on the cross and the unimaginable mercy of the gospel.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 1:1-27, 2 Samuel 2:1-32, Psalm 60, Romans 12:14\n\nHave you ever watched the 1950s movie, Sunset Boulevard? Norma, an aging Hollywood starlet, longs for a comeback. She’s deluded enough to think that by sheer force of will, she can break back into the business with a new movie. It goes horribly wrong for her, and the movie ends as she descends a staircase, guilty of murder, smiling and waving to the flashes of reporters’ cameras as she’s taken into police custody. Norma couldn’t loosen her vulture-grip on her own fame to see reality.\n\nNow, I’m not usually a wide-eyed crazy lady clawing at the scraps of my imagined life—or am I? Do I try to hold onto things that are gone and out of my control? Do I secretly attempt to force God to do my bidding? I suspect that because of our sin nature, we all try to control our own circumstances, instead of trusting God to go to bat for us.\n\nThe aging starlet reminds me of King Saul. While Saul was still in power, Samuel anointed David as God’s choice for king (1 Samuel 16:1). Instead of gracefully stepping down, Saul raged on, fighting for years against both David and the will of God.\n\nLook at the story from David’s perspective. He was the youngest and the least impressive of all his brothers. Although Samuel did have a small family ceremony after he anointed him, not much changed right away for David. He was still the little brother who had to tend the sheep. \n\nBut one very significant thing did change immediately: the Spirit of the Lord came upon David and departed from Saul, who was then plagued by an evil spirit (1 Samuel 16:14). Although David didn’t actually assume the throne for years after he was anointed, the Spirit of the Lord was with him. That was more valuable than 10,000 thrones. While Saul scraped and grasped to keep control of his kingdom, David waited on God’s timing and spent the years learning to listen to the Lord.\n\nDespite the Lord’s clear choice of David as king over Israel, Saul was unwilling to give up the kingdom. He knew David would be king, but he was unable to let go of his delusion of power before his death. \n\nDavid didn’t have to scramble and fight for the crown. The Lord chose him; He gave David the throne (2 Samuel 2). David didn’t have to take matters into his own hands. God had everything under control, and He still does. His faithfulness frees us to be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, and faithful in prayer. Like David, we are free to bless, and not curse, those who would seek to harm us (Romans 12:12,14). \n\nWe don’t have to claw, hustle, and scratch to make things happen in our lives. God is still sovereign. In spite of all Saul’s labors, his day was over as David’s was ready to begin. David waited patiently for the Lord, and we can, too, with confidence. God will defend and protect us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kim Thomas\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 3:1-39, 2 Samuel 4:1-12, Psalm 30:11-12, Jeremiah 16:5-9\n\nFor me, when studying Old Testament books like 1 and 2 Samuel, it’s best to do so with an understanding of context, time, and culture. Although the vitriol on display in the public square today—where we’ve lost the art of respectful discussion and disagreement—is not much more pleasant, the violence and carnage of the civil war stories found in 2 Samuel are indeed gruesome.\n\nWe begin with the end in mind: “During the long war between the house of Saul and the house of David, David was growing stronger and the house of Saul was becoming weaker” (2 Samuel 3:1). From there, the writer unfolds the machinations and details of kingdom intrigue for us. There are birth announcements, power moves, peace agreements made and broken, deceptions, murders, people wanting the right thing but going about it the wrong way. And in the middle of the bloodthirsty ambition surrounding him, David is becoming a leader.\n\nWhile he is not without shame, we do get to witness David’s growth as a man and king. Rather than the foolish mischief of those who would woo him towards calculated misdeeds to secure the throne, David is engaged with the ways of honor and justice, poetic lament and respect. These are things that honor his God and serve to build loyalty in his people: the right things, for the right reasons.\n\nAnd have you noticed David’s patience and trust in God’s promise? God spoke to Samuel, instructing that the young boy David was His choice, the one to be anointed (1 Samuel 16). But now, many years later, he is a grown man and still waiting. He waited through Saul’s manic ranting and reign, spending one minute in Saul’s good graces, and the next dodging Saul’s attempts to kill him.\n\nAt one opportune moment, when David could have ended Saul’s dangerous obsession with him, he submissively clips his garment rather than taking his life. Rather than seizing the opportunity to impose his own moment, he learns the patience that comes from belonging to a faithfully sovereign, promise-keeping God. David knew he was God’s anointed one, and he rested in that promise.\n\nNot once does he whine or complain. He doesn’t rehearse a martyr’s refrain or an entitled person’s manifesto. (I’d actually give him room to do any of those.) David has found an intimate place before the Lord where his soul rests and sings. Even in the midst of carnage and betrayal, David rests in knowing he was God’s anointed.\n\nThat’s my big takeaway from these verses, and it’s a big one. Though, I’m contextually without a monarchy and not bearing up under such gruesome circumstances as David’s. I’m just managing today and my own expectations—expectations of myself, people I love, opportunities I think should be mine (maybe a bit like Abner), and to be honest, my expectations of God. I’m afraid I’ve whined and complained out of a sense of entitlement. But I so want to live gracefully, daily trusting in the sovereignty of God’s faithfulness.\n\nThankfully, God’s promise-keeping did not end with David’s throne. The promised Messiah and Redeemer of the Davidic line has come (2 Samuel 3:18). When unrest shakes our souls, we can take refuge in our relationship with our Promise Keeper God. Abiding in His presence strengthens us so we can wait on Him, His perfect will, and His perfect timing.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 5:1-25, 2 Samuel 6:1-23, 2 Samuel 7:1-29, 1 Corinthians 12:12-20, Hebrews 10:19-22\n\nI’ve always assumed that a covenant is an if/then agreement. If you do x, then I’ll do y. If you fail to do x, then I’m entitled to y. Since dissecting legal mumbo-jumbo isn’t really my thing, the idea of a covenant always felt a little sterile to me. \n\nMaybe that’s why I typically paid little attention to the Old Testament covenants. God’s covenant promises are mentioned in many places, so I did plenty of glossing over them. The biggies include the Noahic Covenant found in Genesis 9, the Abrahamic Covenant in Genesis 12, and the Mosaic Covenant in Exodus 19. \n\nBecause I only skimmed these passages, I thought the covenants were cut-and-dried versions of this: If God’s people obey the law, they get blessed; if they fail to obey the law, they get cursed. Certainly, there are blessings that come with obedience, and consequences that come with rebellion—but that isn’t the bottom line. It’s not how God does business. \n\nGod’s covenants are not equal partnerships. God gives infinitely more than He ever plans to receive.\n\nWe see this clearly in God’s covenant with David (2 Samuel 7). God had been blessing David since childhood, but here, He makes it official. God promises David these things: fame and prestige, deep roots, safety and security, legacy, and a bright future. \n\nGod promised big! This is the “then” portion of God’s covenant with David. But what was the “if”? What did David have to do to earn these lavish gifts? Well, for starters he had to….\n\n(Crickets.)\n\nNothing. There is no “if” to qualify God’s “then.” David doesn’t have do his part for this covenant agreement to stand. God promises David that His “faithful love will never leave him” (v.15). He gives generously out of His extravagant love, not legal obligation. And David’s response is awestruck worship.\n\n“This is why you are great, Lord God. There is no one like you, and there is no God besides you, as all we have heard confirms.”\n-2 Samuel 7:22\n\nDavid enjoyed what I missed when I zoomed past the previous covenants: God doesn’t love us out of obligation. There is no way for the scales to be equal when man enters into a covenant with the God who created him. \n\nThe covenants of the Old Testament are like neon signs pointing to something bigger and better. They set the table for the fulfillment of God’s covenant of grace, perfected in the finished work of Christ on our behalf. \n\n“In the same way he also took the cup after the supper and said, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood; it is shed for you.” – Luke 22:20\n\nThe covenant Jesus offers us is this: we bring our nothing, and He gives us everything. The scales are forever tipped in our favor. May we learn to stop glossing over the goodness of our God. Instead, let us respond in worship to the God who gives extravagantly.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 8:1-18, 2 Samuel 9:1-13, 2 Samuel 10:1-19, Acts 4:24-28\n\nWhen I was 20 years old, I spent a semester by myself in Chile. I was an intern there—not part of a full study abroad program with tons of other college students. I lived with a host family and worked with other Americans, but there was no one else there in the same position. I found myself pretty much alone. \n\nOne day, my Spanish teacher invited me to an “asado” at her house. A Chilean asado is a backyard barbecue on steroids: hours and hours of food, drink, laughter, stories, and family. It’s a feast for the stomach and the heart. I didn’t have much going on during the weekends, so I went. I’ll never forget the feeling of overwhelming acceptance washing over me that day. I felt known and welcomed there. For one afternoon, I was completely enveloped into their family.\n\nI’ve never been in David’s shoes—a newly-crowned king looking to gain and maintain power. But I have been in Mephibosheth’s, feeling like the lonely outcast. Mephibosheth was the crippled grandson of the fallen king; all tradition and expectation would have been for David to ignore him at best, and kill him at worst. \n\nBut the victorious and powerful King David, remembering his promise to Jonathan and Saul, instead seeks Mephibosheth out and honors him. He restores the family land to Mephibosheth, and invites him to feast at his table. Even Mephibosheth can’t believe it. “What is your servant that you take an interest in a dead dog like me?” (2 Samuel 9:8).\n\nDavid’s kindness is not spur of the moment, either. He seeks out Mephibosheth to offer him “hesed,” the Hebrew word for lovingkindness. This word is found all over the Old Testament, used to describe God’s steadfast love and faithfulness to His people. In Exodus 34, God Himself uses hesed to describe His own character: “The Lord passed in front of him and proclaimed: The Lord—the Lord is a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love and truth” (v.6).\n\nWhat we see David give to Mephibosheth is the same lovingkindness that God offers us through His Son. David invited Mephibosheth to be “like one of the king’s sons.” \n\nIt’s impossible to read this story and not see myself—crippled in spirit, with nothing to give, and yet completely welcomed into Christ’s family because of God’s lovingkindness to me. I am Mephibosheth, Joseph’s brothers, Job, and the prodigal son all rolled into one. And God seeks me out, the way David seeks out Mephibosheth. \n\nJesus invites us to a feast far greater than King David’s, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink” (John 7:37). May we answer His invitation with thankful hearts, filled with the unsurpassed joy that comes from knowing our Father loves us with perfect, steadfast love.  \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessie Minassian\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 11:1-27, 2 Samuel 12:1-25, Psalm 51:1-19, Isaiah 42:1-4\n\nThe sins that tend to shock us most are the ones committed by those who know better. \n\nWhen we’ve walked with God a long time, learned from Him, depended on Him through dark valleys—when we’ve tasted and seen that the Lord is indeed good—and then choose sin instead, our fall feels twice as far and three times as hard.\n\nIf anyone were immune to moral failure, you’d think it would be the boy-turned-king who watched a giant fall at his feet. The one whom God miraculously spared from death and handed a kingdom. The one who wrote dozens of songs about his devotion to God, and God’s devotion to him. The one whom God specifically chose for his loyalty and obedience (1 Samuel 13:14; Psalm 89:20). But even great faith doesn’t inoculate us against temptation. \n\nWhen it comes to sin, we’re never more than a couple bad choices away from our worst moment. Humility must rule our hearts. Boundaries must guard our choices.\n\nDavid’s sin, much like many of ours, began as a slow slide. “In the Spring when kings march out to war,” David was home instead (2 Samuel 11:1). Apparently he felt his kingdom was secure enough that his right-hand military man, Joab, could take care of business on his own. Maybe he suffered from vocational boredom or spiritual apathy. Maybe he had a mid-life crisis, or he was just feeling lazy and lax. That’s when temptation came. Then justification. Then trespass.\n\nDavid’s sin left a wake of consequences that affected not only him, but Uriah, Bathsheba, an innocent baby boy, and an entire nation. But even with all that collateral damage, the real weight of David’s story wasn’t in his failure but in his restoration. God confronted, then offered forgiveness to, the man who undeniably “knew better.” \n\nThe implications are too beautiful to ignore: we may have to face natural or divine consequences for our sin, but God never refuses to forgive. \n\nBut there’s even more good news woven through this story. One sin—even a whole season of bad choices—doesn’t have to define our lives. Yes, David sinned. He sinned big. But long after David’s body turned to dust, God still measured other kings’ successes or failures by David’s heart (1 Kings 14:7-8; 2 Kings 14:3, 16:2), blessed generations for his sake (2 Kings 8:19, 19:34, 20:6), and made good on His promise to bring the Messiah through his descendents (Psalm 89:3-4; Ezekiel 37:25; Luke 1:69). \n\nDavid’s life was marked by faith and obedience—not just in spite of his biggest mess-ups, but also because of how he repented and walked through them.\n\nOnce again, God’s grace weaves through lives that seem beyond redemption: through David’s story, your story, and mine. But we can rest assured that He is bigger than our greatest failures.\n\nThanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 12:26-31, 2 Samuel 13:1-39, 2 Samuel 14:1-33, Leviticus 18:9, Deuteronomy 22:28-29\n\n“I want to see it, Mom. I’m old enough.” This is what our daughter said to us recently as my husband and I watched the news. We flipped the channel as she walked into the room, and she objected, claiming she could handle it. She wanted, needed, to know what was happening. \n\nIt’s a hard line to toe—the line between protecting and equipping—and not just when it comes to children. Even as adults, it’s difficult to know the difference between necessary and gratuitous knowledge. The world is dark. The world is broken. We know this. But knowing in theory is not the same as knowing in fact. It takes coming face to face with the depth and darkness of sin to understand that these are not problems that can be solved with pen and paper and policy. These are problems of the heart. \n\nI know myself. And I know—at least I think I know—the sin I am capable of. I know the darkness I’ve indulged, both in thought and in action, and this knowledge chills me to the bone. But I also know the sin that has been committed against me, sins I have rarely uttered and would be thankful to forget—injustices I may not see a reckoning for this side of heaven. Songwriter Ellie Holcomb sings a line that resonates deep within me, especially when those scenes from the past come calling on my conscience: “I need a rescue, I need a reckoning for all the things I’ve done and have been done to me.” \n\nWe all need a rescue. We all yearn for a reckoning. \n\nToday’s passage contains, for me, one of the most difficult in all of Scripture. I have tears brimming in my eyes even as I type this. Tamar’s story makes my insides burn with anger and weep with sorrow at the manifestations of sin. Yet with the fire and the sorrow, I feel the tender voice of the Holy Spirit whisper to my aching heart, “I see this too. In the darkest of the dark—I am here, too.” \n\nThese passages from 2 Samuel show us the ugly truth of sin. Sin is deceitful. It is born and bred in lies. Jonadab designed a web of deceit, and Amnon was all too willing to step into it and make it his own. Sin creates desolation—utter emptiness. Amnon’s pleasure became hollow in an instant, and his sin dragged others into this misery. Sin leaves a wake of destruction. What is done cannot be undone. Yes, there is grace for the repentant, but there are still consequences.\n\nI want to gather Tamar into my arms and tell her she is seen. I want her to know that though disgraced, she is valued. I want her to know that though discarded, she is wanted. I want her to know that though dismissed—the sin committed against her gone year after year unacknowledged—that she has a God who fights for her. I want to tell her all the things I wish I could tell myself every time I’ve felt disgraced, discarded, dismissed. \n\nOur God receives us, rescues us, and restores us. This is the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nAs we stand here at the end of these tough chapters of 2 Samuel, that is all I have in my hands today. I stand, weeping for the reality and consequences of sin, holding the knowledge that we serve a God who sees. He sees us in our struggle against sin, and He offers us His righteousness and strength (Romans 5:17). He sees us when we are hurt and hollowed out, and He offers us His unending, unbreakable love (Exodus 15:13). He sees the wrongs that plague this dark, sin-stained world, and He offers us His promise to make all things new (Revelation 21:5). He vows to dry our tears, not just with His compassion but also with His justice (Revelation 21:4). \n\nYes, this world is ever so broken. But God is here. He is the Healer and Redeemer, and He is with us. \n\nThank you, Jesus, for coming to dwell with us, for giving your life for the sins of the world. Thank you, Jesus, that the gospel is true.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 15:1-37, 2 Samuel 16:1-23, 2 Samuel 17:1-29, Psalm 96:10, Isaiah 11:1-5\n\nWe think of God’s favor as an endless river of glittering gifts, but that’s not the whole story. \n\nDavid shows us that God’s favor isn’t always an easy pill to swallow. Sure, he received a kingdom from the Lord (2 Samuel 7:8). That gift came with plenty of perks, but being a man after God’s own heart also came with challenges. \n\nWhen Samuel anointed David as king, I’m sure it was a happy occasion, mostly because Samuel never mentioned the possibility of facing down a giant (1 Samuel 17), potential death threats from the existing king (1 Samuel 18-23), and the massive temptations that come with being the most powerful man in the land (2 Samuel 11). Samuel certainly didn’t mention that David would have to fight his own beloved son to keep his kingdom.\n\nWe find the story of Absalom’s rebellion in 2 Samuel 13-18. The wheels started to come off the train when David’s son Amnon raped his half-sister, Tamar. Tamar’s brother, Absalom (Amnon’s half-brother), was enraged by his brother’s sin and eventually had Amnon killed (2 Samuel 13).  \n\nThis was a low blow for David, but the hits had just started coming. Absalom fled to live with his grandparents. During that long season of waiting, a bitter root started to grow in Absalom’s heart. Though his father eventually welcomed him home with a kiss, Absalom began to plot a coup to take the throne. He launched a PR campaign, tricked 200 men into joining his cause, recruited David’s advisers, amassed an army, and prepared to march on to Jerusalem.\n\nThe same David who had been promised a kingdom that would last forever put on a disguise and ran for his life.\n\nThough the battle cost him mightily—20,000 casualties, including his own son—David kept his throne, and God kept His promises. Yes, David was highly favored by God, but that didn’t vaccinate him from hard work and heartbreak.\n\nThis story reminds me of another hero who knew the gut-wrenching reality of God’s favor.  \n\n“And the angel came to [Mary] and said, ‘Rejoice, favored woman! The Lord is with you.” – Luke 1:28\n\nYes, Mary was a “favored woman” with reason to rejoice. But serving God also meant suffering. The angel didn’t mention that Mary would watch her miracle boy die a horrible death on the cross.\n\nWhen we confuse God’s favor with a free ticket to Easy Street, we can find ourselves easily blindsided. As God’s child, you are highly favored, but that doesn’t mean life will never throw you a curveball. Absalom’s rebellion shows us that suffering is not a sure sign that God’s favor has left us. \n\nWill we praise God, even when His favor comes with both victories and challenges?\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 18:1-33, 2 Samuel 19:1-43, Romans 5:7-8, 1 Timothy 1:12-17\n\nI have to admit I wanted justice to be done to Absalom. I remembered how he had treated David in prior chapters. He betrayed him. Tricked him. Risen up against him. It was wrong, and Absalom needed to be punished. Even though David had given his men strict orders not to hurt him, when Joab took advantage of Absalom’s vulnerable position and killed him, I thought to myself, Well, he deserved it. It gave me the same kind of satisfaction I have when watching a movie and the good guy finally finishes off the bad guy in the end. \n\nOf course, the Bible isn’t a movie. It’s real life. And a few verses later, I was reminded of this. When David hears of Absalom’s death, he cries out, “My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!” (2 Samuel 18:33). With those words, my sense of justice deflated and tears came to my eyes. \n\nAbsalom was David’s child. David had held him as a baby. He’d watched him grow up. He’d probably taught him to be the strong warrior he was. And though their story took a turn for the worse and reconciliation was needed, there was once a time when father and son ate meals together. They were family. \n\nWith David’s grief-stricken response to the news of his son’s death, this story of civil war  becomes a story of a father losing his son—a story not unlike our own. \n\nThe hard truth is that both Absalom and I deserved the same ending. I betray God with each sin I commit. I try to manipulate His will. I go my own way, as if I am the king of my life and He is not. \n\nThis is true of all of us. But this is also true: “God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). This is what changed the ending for us. We were headed toward a sure death due to our own sin, but God in His kindness sent His Son to die in our stead, so that we could be reconciled to our Father.  \n\nThe father-son story in 2 Samuel 18 is a tragedy. David never got to reconcile with Absalom. He did not get to give his life so Absalom could live. Though our story parallels Absalom’s, our ending turns in the opposite direction. Because of Christ, we are reconciled to our Father. Because of Christ, we have victory over death. Because of Christ, Paul’s words are ours too:\n\nChrist Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst. But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. –1 Timothy 1:15-16\n\n",

    "devo_title": "David’s Song of Thanksgiving",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 20:1-26, 2 Samuel 21:1-22, 2 Samuel 22:1-51, Psalm 89:29-33, Revelation 20:11-15\n\nChronologically speaking, David’s Song of Thanksgiving recorded in 2 Samuel 22 belongs earlier in David’s story, closer to the beginning of the book. David probably wrote this before he was king, around the time he had been saved from Saul and realized his place on the throne was eminent. \n\nDavid was in for an eventful forty-year kingship, filled with many highs and many lows. To name a few—\n\nHigh: David is crowned king of Israel.\nHigh: He moves the capital of Israel to Jerusalem.\nLow: He commits adultery with Bathsheba and has Bathsheba’s husband killed.\nLow: David and Bathsheba’s son dies as a consequence of David’s sin.\nHigh: God forgives David for his adultery and blesses him with his son Solomon.\nLow: His son Absalom kills his other son Amnon to avenge the rape of Absalom’s sister Tamar.\nLow: Absalom tries to take the kingdom of Israel from him.\nHigh: David’s men defeat Absalom’s men and the kingdom is restored to him.\nLow: Absalom is killed in battle.\n\nDavid’s problems did not end with Saul. A rollercoaster of war, death, family rivalry, and suffering would mark his days. And as his circumstances changed, so did his character. Faithful one minute, unfaithful the next. God’s character, however, did not change. He was David’s rock during a lifetime of shifting sand.\n\nThroughout the Song of Thanksgiving, David describes God with adjectives and metaphors of strength and consistency:\n\n“The Lord is my rock, my fortress, my deliverer” (v.2).\n“My shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold, my refuge” (v.3).\n“… the Lord was my support” (v.19).\n“And who is a rock? Only our God” (v. 32).\n“The Lord lives—blessed be my rock!” (v. 47).\n\nIf you were to write down your life’s list of highs and lows, it may not be as dramatic as David’s, but I’ll bet it’s just as inconsistent. Suffering, hope, despair, joy—our circumstances are constantly changing and with them, our hearts. Faithful today, unfaithful tomorrow. But just as God intervened in David’s life and pulled him out of deep waters (2 Samuel 22:17), so did He intervene in our lives by sending Jesus Christ, who entered this world to save us from the dark waters of sin. Christ is now the rock on which we stand. The winds will change and they will change us, but His faithfulness to us will not. \n\nI like that the writer of 2 Samuel placed David’s Song of Thanksgiving at the end of the book. The words were true before David’s forty-year reign, and they were true after it. David’s change in circumstances did not signify a change in God’s character. I wonder how often he went back to the words he wrote on that day of thanksgiving. I wonder if, in his darkest nights, he clung to what he knew to be true of God then, even if it didn’t feel true in the present moment. \n\nWhat aspects of God’s character did you sing yesterday that you need to remember today? In the midst of life’s changing waters, we can be sure that we have been pulled out of the depths. That is a consistent truth. \n\nLet’s be thankful today that our character and circumstances do not change who God is or what Jesus did. As we move through life’s highs and lows, we worship a God who is the same, all the time, even when we are not. He will not take His love from us, and He will never betray His faithfulness. Thanks be to God.  \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: 2 Samuel 23:1-39, 2 Samuel 24:1-25, Micah 1:2-3, John 2:19-22\n\nThey say that at the end of life, things will become clearer. Our priorities will crystallize and our discernment will sharpen. They say no one ever lies on their deathbed and says, “I should have spent more time at the office.” No one wishes they’d been less generous, less loving, less devoted to forgiveness and reconciliation. The secret, then, is to live now with the end in mind—to live now like we’ll wish we had then. \n\nThis is what they say. But what does the Bible say?\n\nScripture is filled with flawed humans who could have lived life better. Aside from Jesus, you’ll be hard pressed to find a person whose deathbed retrospective is free of wishes or regrets. Come to think of it, the idea of finding a “secret” to outsmarting our humanity is wholly absent in the 66 books of the Bible. \n\nInstead of giving us life hacks, God’s Word gives us a promise: our life here on earth exists within our truer, eternal life with God through His Son.\n\nWhen we reach the final chapters of 2 Samuel, at the end of David’s life, we don’t find him urging us to be our best selves. We find him composing a final poem—one last expression of what he knows to be true of God and his life with God. In it, David declares:\n\nIs it not true my house is with God?\nFor he has established a permanent covenant with me,\nordered and secured in every detail.\nWill he not bring about\nMy whole salvation and my every desire?\n–2 Samuel 23:5\n\nDavid’s dying thoughts don’t hinge on what he has or has not done, but rather on what God has done and continues to do. \n\nGod made a covenant with David and He ordered every detail, in David’s life and beyond, to uphold that covenant. The second half of chapter 23 gives us a glimpse into those details—a brief and profound look into God’s provision, for David and for all people of the covenant, through the exploits of David’s “Mighty Men.” \n\nThis group of more than thirty men were named and known, both by the Lord and by David. Their devotion to God’s anointed king was no accident, and neither was the bravery and might they displayed on David’s behalf. One, named Eleazar, fought until he quite literally could not go on. Verse 10 says he “stood his ground and attacked the Philistines until his hand was tired and stuck to his sword.” Even so, Scripture makes it clear that God brought about the victory that day (1 Samuel 23:10). Another, called Benaiah, “went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion” (v.20). A trio of men known as “the Three” risked their lives just to bring a thirsty, homesick King David a drink of water from his hometown well (vv.15-16). \n\nI circled their names in my study book—these warriors of the covenant who are known by name to the Lord and now to us so many generations later. It was the name at the end of the list that made my stomach lurch: Uriah the Hethite (v.39). The same Uriah who was married to Bathsheba. The same Uriah who was killed to cover up the king’s own sin. A mighty man snuffed out by a powerful one. \n\nOur stories, like David’s, are complicated. They are filled with things we did and didn’t do, things other people did and didn’t do, and the consequences that followed. We have days when we look like heroes and days when our hearts look as murderous and unfaithful as David’s did with Uriah and Bathsheba. The story told in 1 and 2 Samuel offers us only one faithful Hero—the Lord. \n\nGod’s faithfulness is the context of David’s story and ours. His sovereignty reigns over every plot point; His mercy is mightier than our regrets. By faith in God’s Son, Jesus, we can stand at the end of our days and say with David, “My house is with God. He has established a permanent covenant with me, ordered and secured in every detail. He will bring about my whole salvation.” \n\nAll glory be to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nBy whatever stroke of chance or luck (or the-opposite-of-luck), I’ve never had to follow in anyone’s footsteps when starting a new job. I’ve always stepped into an unformed role and had the joy (and challenge) of shaping it to fit the opportunities before me. \n\nBut a few months ago, that changed. I took a job that someone had held previously, and the awkwardness of learning to walk in your own shoes on someone else’s tightrope has required more grace and patience than I ever could have expected. It’s like constantly looking in a mirror but the reflection isn’t you. I feel like I’m tipping over all the sacred cows, even as I try to tread lightly while I also prove myself. It’s a mess of idols and pride, and it’s hard. \n\nDavid was the king. He was King David, a man after God’s own heart. He was King David, who brought the ark of the covenant back to Jerusalem. He was David, to whom God promised a descendant on his throne forever. The shepherd boy who became king, David was the standard against whom all other kings of Israel would be judged. Taking his place would have been daunting, but it would also lead to unprecedented power. \n\nWhen David was on his deathbed, two men believed they held claim to his throne: Adonijah and Solomon. Both wanted to step into his shoes, lead his people, and claim his fame. Adonijah was David’s oldest surviving son, but David had promised Bathsheba that their son Solomon would be the next king (1 Kings 1:13). Chaos ensued, with back-room conversations and an attempted coup. But David, when told that “the eyes of all Israel are on you to tell them who will sit on the throne” (v.20), affirmed that Solomon was his choice. \n\nChapter 2 opens with David’s charge to Solomon. It is full of encouragement to “be strong and be a man” (v.2), and admonishes the soon-to-be king to walk in God’s “ways [and] keep his statutes, commands, ordinances, and decrees” (v.3). David then reminds his son of the covenant promise God made to him: “If your sons guard their way to walk faithfully before me with all their heart and all their soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel” (v.4).\n\nOur privilege as those who hold the entire canon of the Bible is that we know how this story goes: Solomon didn’t always follow the Lord and His ways. His father David didn’t. Nor did the rest of Israel and Judah’s other kings. \n\nBut despite the failures of humankind, our God reigns. In Israel’s time of transition, God reigned. In every second before and every second after, God reigned, is reigning, and will reign forever. While our earthly leaders matter, our ultimate allegiance is to God’s Kingdom and to the perfect King of kings, Jesus. It means we can live lightly but intentionally, resting in the holy, sovereign kingship of the One who will make everything new as we advocate for His Kingdom to grow on earth here and now. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nFor a couple of years in the late ’90s, it was “cool” for girls to be ditzy. It was, like… so cute to act like you didn’t have a lot of common sense. This trend permeated culture with its linguistic “valleyspeak,” and was reinforced by iconic, pop culture movies like Clueless. As an awkward but intelligent middle school girl, I often bought into the false cultural narrative that smart girls aren’t as worthy or attractive or likely to succeed as the popular sort. I was tempted to “play dumb” in front of my peers, hoping they would like me more. It seemed (as it does so often today), that money and brands and clothes and cars were the most important things. \n\nThankfully, this phase–and middle school itself–didn’t last very long. I found bookish friends and kindred spirits, and we made it through high school with some confidence still intact. But the temptation to present myself as something more or different than who I truly am exists to this day. In every area of life, I believe I am not enough of what I ought to be, that there are things I can do to create an image of enough-ness. \n\nAfter Solomon inherited the kingship from his father David, the Lord appeared to him in a dream. God offered Solomon anything he wanted: “Ask. What should I give you?” (1 Kings 3:5).\n\nWhat temptation must have presented itself in that moment! I wonder how I would answer that question, but in my heart I know. I would probably ask for financial security, or health and safety for everyone I love. I would ask for everyone to love me. I would ask for freedom from fear and pain. I would ask for many things—all of them for me. \n\nBut Solomon asked for others, and he asked for an invisible thing: wisdom. “Yet I am just a youth with no experience in leadership,” Solomon said. “Your servant is among your people you have chosen, a people too many to be numbered or counted. So give your servant a receptive heart to judge your people and to discern between good and evil” (1 Kings 3:7–9). \n\nSolomon asked for a heart and mind shaped more by God than by the world. And God answered that prayer lavishly. Solomon gained supernatural wisdom but also fame, wealth, and honor worldwide. “Emissaries of all peoples, sent by every king on earth who had heard of his wisdom, came to listen to Solomon’s wisdom,” (1 Kings 4:34).\n\nWhen Solomon judged wisely, he didn’t claim the fame for himself either—at least, not at first. After the infamous baby cutting story (1 Kings 3:16–28), the glory was God’s. “All Israel heard about the judgment the king had given, and they stood in awe of the king because they saw that God’s wisdom was in him to carry out justice” (v.28). \n\nGod doesn’t regularly appear to me in dreams, offering me whatever my heart desires. But Scripture does tell me that when I petition the Lord, He hears me. “This is the confidence we have before him: If we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears whatever we ask, we know that we have what we have asked of him,” (1 John 5:14–15). When we seek wisdom, we should seek “God—who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly—and it will be given” to us (James 1:5).\n\nWhen I measure my prayers against Solomon’s, I see how material and vapid they tend to be. Yes, health, financial security, and safety are valid requests to bring to God. But the undergirding theme of my prayers should be about the shape of my heart, mind, and will, that they would be abounding with the wisdom of God and aligned with His mission to bring peace, shalom, and abundance to His people and His world. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI love looking at real estate online. I love flipping open an app and scanning houses both nearby and far away, homes that I might one day be able to afford (probably not), and dream about the parties I could host, the backyard adventures my kids could have, and the ideal life one of these houses would surely provide me. \n\nCurrently, I live in a very nice house that we built a few years ago. We chose the finishes and the floors, everything down to the grout. I love every room, and it is more than I ever could have imagined owning. And yet, I spend a lot of time window shopping for a new house. My heart beats to the rhythm of what’s next, what’s better, what would make my life more. More what? I don’t always know. But I am always chasing it. \n\nSolomon built an extravagant temple for the Lord. Every detail mattered, the length of the doorways and the beveled frames for each window. It mattered where the stones were finished (at the quarry) and how gold was overlaid on the interior walls. We know the details mattered because they are written in Scripture, in God’s revelation to His people. The temple was a stunning architectural achievement, built with detail for the holy God of Israel. \n\nAnd yet, Solomon kept building. This time, he built for himself. He was chasing more. It took twenty years to build God’s temple and then Solomon’s palace. Solomon’s story will unfold over the next few chapters of 1 Kings, but we start to see glimpses here of what is to come. Solomon’s itch for more—a bigger palace, more wives, places of worship for other gods—begins to present itself, and it will slowly unravel his kingship. \n\nKing Solomon was on top of his world. He was the most famous, wealthiest, wisest king in all the earth. But his need for more would eventually be his undoing. In 1 Kings 6:13, God made this promise to Solomon: “If you walk in my statutes, observe my ordinances, and keep all my commands by walking in them, I will fulfill my promise to you, which I made to your father David. I will dwell among the Israelites and not abandon my people Israel.”\n\nSolomon didn’t keep God’s commands, but the Lord did keep His promise. I think we will always itch for more until the fulfillment of God’s kingdom, when all tears will dry and we will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. That is the house I should crave, not this world’s version of a perfect home or false security. I want to crave the perfect peace, righteousness, and future that God promises me through Jesus. One day in His presence is better than a thousand elsewhere (Psalm 84:10). May God continue to make over my heart with a longing for Him and His house alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nOur house is a wreck. At the moment, each piece of furniture we own resides in the middle of its designated room, covered in plastic wrap. The master bathroom is halfway through a renovation, which means that it currently looks worse than it did before the hammer first fell. A crew of painters came last week and rolled our walls white. There are a few unfinished places: a patch in the living room, a circle around the dining room chandelier. Yesterday, our contractor went to open a box containing two porcelain sinks for the bathroom, and as soon as he touched the box, the contents inside clinked and scratched like a windchime. We knew they were broken. He laughed and wiped his nose. I, on the other hand, said some things I’m not so proud of.\n\nConstruction is not easy. But through it all, I’ve held onto the hope of what’s to come: a restful, fresh retreat for our family to enjoy for years to come. A place to connect with the people I love, where I will leave renewed to face the trials of the world. When it’s finished—God, please let them finish—I will be the first to sing, “Hallelujah!”\n\nThat’s what’s happening in today’s reading of 1 Kings on a far grander, more historic scale. King David dreamed of building a temple worthy of God’s glory—but God reserved the joy of building that temple for his son Solomon. Temple construction had ended, but Solomon knew the job wasn’t complete until the ark of the covenant resided inside. For context, keep in mind that, years earlier, when the Israelites moved the ark, someone died (2 Samuel 6). This was no laughing matter. And though Solomon threw an epic celebration to welcome the ark, no doubt the people trembled with fear and as it was moved into its rightful home. \n\nIt’s interesting to me that Solomon’s prayer of dedication addresses a list of worst-case-scenarios: When we are defeated. When there is a drought. When there is famine. If his prayer tells us anything, it’s that the temple wasn’t a magical place to avoid the pain of the world. It was a sacred place to be with God in the midst of that sorrow. He prays that God will forgive, save, and redeem His people, even in the midst of every possible catastrophe. Solomon’s prayer ends with a reminder of why they built the temple in the first place: so that “all the peoples of the earth would know that the LORD is God. There is no other!” (1 Kings 8:60). All this work was to remind the world of the truth: God wants to be with his people. \n\nAnd he wants to be with us too. So much so, that He didn’t stop moving toward us after Solomon built his temple. Several hundred years later, Jesus was born in Bethlehem. When He began His teaching ministry, Jesus shared radically great news—a time was coming when we wouldn’t have to go to a particular place to commune with God (John 4:21, 23). Because of Jesus’s work on the cross, God can commune with us always, without the barrier of a building. By God’s Spirit, we are welcome to be present in the holy of holies, near to God, sharing in Jesus’s glory right this second. \n\nHow do we know this is true? In His final prayer before He was betrayed and crucified, Jesus asks God the Father to be as near to us as He was to Jesus. Jesus asks for God to do a construction project in our hearts. He prays for us, saying, “I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them” (John 17:26).\n\nEven Solomon’s temple in all of its splendor wasn’t as remarkable as the temple that God occupies in the center of our spirit. God is where He wants to be: with us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nI recently discovered a website that sells bona fide designer items at discounted prices. (However, even at a “discount,” everything is still way out of my price range.) Surfing this site is like taking a sneak peek into a famous, wildly wealthy person’s closet. I’m not actually indulging. I’m just browsing! But the slope is steep. I know from past experience that I can easily go from browsing, to buying, to justifying in about two-point-five seconds flat. \n\nOur culture is obsessed with wealth, beauty, and sexuality. Social media influencers attempt to sell me expensive clothes, face oils, and procedures, showing me what life could look like if I had access to more—more money, more freedom, more of everything. And yet, for all their photos of fancy clothes, private jets, and exotic places, no one has risen to the level of King Solomon at the height of his wealth and influence. It was out of control and unfathomable.\n\nLong story short? Solomon got caught up in the things of this world, not only in the trappings of his wealth, but in the sexual power it gave him over women. The numbers are staggering: seven hundred wives, three hundred concubines— I mean, how would one even have the time for a thousand lovers? It’s safe to say that many of these women weren’t there by choice. The evil in many of Solomon’s actions would be hard to calculate in terms that would translate to today’s world. At the very least, he was an idolator and an adulterer to the highest degree. In the beginning, wealth gave Solomon freedom. In the end, it enslaved him.\n\nEvery time he added possessions and people to his entourage, Solomon believed he was gaining power. In reality, he was giving himself away. Bit by bit, the wisdom and character that had made him famous faded as his unfaithfulness to a faithful God grew. But it wasn’t wisdom and character or wealth that had built his kingdom—the Lord did all of that. While He did bless Solomon with “a wise and understanding heart” and even the “riches and honor” he hadn’t asked for, the blessing was always tied to Solomon’s commitment to walk in God’s “ways and keep [His] statutes” (1 Kings 3:12–14). In other words, Solomon would have to choose God’s wisdom over his own—every single day. Instead, “Solomon did what was evil in the LORD’s sight, and unlike his father David, he did not remain loyal to the LORD” (1 Kings 11:6).\n\nWealth has a way of making me believe the absolute lie that I don’t need God. I know the slippery slope firsthand. And while Solomon’s actions are unfathomable, if I had been given all the wealth in the world, I hope that my heart would remain pure. But I don’t know for sure. Solomon lost sight of his need for God. It’s easy for me to do the same. \n\nJesus, help me to fix my eyes on You. Close my eyes to anything that would give me the illusion of power, pleasure, or position. May my life remain fully dependent on You, the One who creates all, gives all, and has within Him the power, wisdom, and the right to take it all away.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nAs far as I know, there were no prophecies about me when I was born. I was one of those blissful “surprise” babies, a child that arrived into the world without permission from her parents. My mother has recounted the tale many times, and I won’t bore you with the details, but needless to say, many “security gates” were jumped in order for me to exist. Today, my mother tells me that, while they might not have thought they wanted me, God knew they needed me. And I believe her. After all, He went through quite a bit of trouble to make sure I got here.\n\nWhen I sat down to read this long passage in 1 Kings, I was immediately struck by the number of prophecies that are attached to this one family. How did they keep track? And when Rehoboam came to power after his father Solomon died, did he know that the Lord was about to tear his kingdom in two? \n\nImagine if he had known of the prophecy. Was his ego puffed up by fear, fueled by the prophecies—prophecies that were not in his favor? It would be a deadly mix leading to a whole lot of posturing, pretending to have strength, rather than turning to God to be strengthened by Him. After all, He is the source of all true wisdom and strength. \n\nRehoboam’s leadership style was vindictive and harsh, perhaps because he assumed that those qualities and that leadership style would translate into strength. Maybe he thought that if he took control of the reins, he could avoid the prophesied loss of power. Instead, his feigned strength led to the exact result he was trying to avoid. After watching his father Solomon rise in wealth and power, Rehoboam was cut down to size. \n\nWhat does this mean for us? And what does it tell us about God?\n\nFirst, we must see that God takes His vows seriously. What He says happens. There is no false posturing, no ego, no vindictive stripe in our God. He doesn’t punish in order to prove His power. He follows through on His word, because His word is good and always comes to fruition. Second, we must see that God holds a high standard for His people, one that requires our faith and trust be placed in Him alone. The division and destruction we see in 1 Kings happened because God allows it, but not because He wants it. Instead, He calls us to live “with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace” (Ephesians 4:2–3).\n\nGod wants His people to be united as one, and so, the Bible is ultimately a tale of restoration—how one man born of one tiny tribe, Judah, is the true and righteous King. He came not just for Israel, and not just for Judah. He came for the entire world.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nAt this point in our reading, the nation of Israel is divided into the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Both kingdoms and their kings are in political turmoil as they face mounting instability, warfare, revolts, and murder. The kingdoms are also in spiritual crisis. King after king “did what was evil in the LORD’s sight” (1 Kings 15:26). They endorsed detestable idol worship, which emboldened the people to set up poles and stones and high places for pagan gods and to engage in shrine prostitution, along with other evil practices. Verse after verse, we read of people who have forsaken the one true God in exchange for worthless, false gods. \n\nAs I read of one evil king after another, I find myself hoping that maybe, just maybe, the next one might be faithful. With that in mind, I find myself cheering as I finally read about Asa, King of Judah, a king who finally “did what was right in the eyes of the Lord.” He abolished shrine prostitution, removed idols, and directed his people back to the Lord’s laws and commands. Asa ruled for 41 years and promoted flourishing and peace for most of his reign.\n\nAsa’s life is a picture of the good, gracious provision of God. His father, Abijam, was not faithful to the Lord, “but for the sake of David, the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up his son after him and preserving Jerusalem” (v.4). In the midst of Abijah’s disobedience, God provided a righteous son who would lead his people. King Asa was a lamp shining God’s light and truth. Finally, a hero in this story!\n\nEh. Not so fast. In 2 Chronicles 16 we read that toward the end of Asa’s reign, as the northern kingdom was threatening Judah, he faltered and trusted in his own power and plans instead of relying on the Lord. Despite shining like a lamp of righteousness for a time, Asa would not even seek help from the Lord as he suffered at the end of his days. While Israel and Judah’s kings floundered in the face of their commitment to the Lord, He remained true to them, keeping this promise to David: \n\n“My faithful love will never leave him as it did when I removed it from Saul,  whom I removed from before you. Your house and kingdom will endure before me forever,  and your throne will be established forever” (2 Samuel 17:15–16).\n\nThe life of King Asa gives us a glimmer of the deliverance that we long for, as well as the realization that it’s futile to trust in kings, or anyone, really—even ourselves. But we sure do try, looking to friends and parents, pastors and employers and political leaders—only to be disappointed, because they stumble and fall and fail too. Though our hope is misplaced, it isn’t pointless; God plants this hope and hunger in us to point us to the King of kings, the ultimate hero, Jesus, who never falters. He is not only a lamp for Jerusalem, but the light of the world (John 8:12).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Patti Sauls\n\nCue the following: a wicked king, a brave prophet, provisions delivered by ravens, a showdown between heavenly powers, and divine fire and rain. Oh, and pass the popcorn, please.\n\nNo, this is not the plot summary of a Hollywood blockbuster. It’s a battle between idolatry and faithfulness found in 1 Kings. This account certainly doesn’t lack drama. The prophet Elijah has been called by God to confront King Ahab. Idolatry had infiltrated Israel as this unfaithful king promoted the worship of Baal, a pagan god of fertility and rain. \n\nGod chose Elijah, whose name means “Yahweh is my God,” to be His mouthpiece to His people. But Elijah’s name was also a heads-up, a signal to His uncompromising message: there is only one God, Yahweh, and only He should be worshiped.\n\nA clear line is drawn as the showdown reaches its climax. Two altars piled high with wood are assembled, and a sacrificial, slaughtered bull is placed atop each altar. One is presented to Baal and the other to Yahweh. Elijah instructs, “Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The God who answers by fire, he is God” (1 Kings 18:24). The false prophets of Baal call out to their god, shouting, dancing, and working themselves into a frenzy—but not a peep nor a spark comes from Baal.\n\nThen, to further prove his point, Elijah has his altar drenched with water three times before he humbly prays that God would answer and turn the hearts of the people back to Himself (1 Kings 18:37). Of course, the fire of the Lord does fall, completely incinerating the offering and its altar. But God does more than answer with intense fire; He releases a heavy rain, ending years of drought. The one, true God is revealed. At the same time, the false god of fertility is exposed as impotent, and the false god of storms is all washed up.\n\nWhat a picture of mercy! After their rejection of Him, God could have brought punishment, but instead He shows compassion. His people had turned from Him, forgotten His love and provision, and abandoned His commands. Yet, God doesn’t turn away, nor is He is silent or indifferent to them. He answers and gathers His people back to Himself. \n\nIf I’m honest, I can relate; I, too, can work myself into a frenzy seeking action from false, futile gods. I may not dance for Baal, but how often do I bow down to money, image, achievement, reputation, health, or people pleasing? Any and all things can function as an idol, if we place them ahead of God. But don’t be fooled: every idol demands worship, and in the end delivers nothing. God alone should be our source of identity and worth, safety and hope.\n\nI’m ashamed to admit that in the morning, before my feet even hit the floor, my mind spins with what I think I must accomplish. My anxiety about managing my world revs up. Ignoring God and depending solely on myself is as tempting as hitting the snooze button. I so easily forget God and His commands, promises, and provision. Is it any wonder that my efforts can seem impotent and my plans washed up?\n\nBut God doesn’t leave me with my head hanging down in shame. Instead of rejecting or abandoning me, He rains down mercy as He speaks to me through His Word and gently turns my face back toward Him. God is not silent, and He does not turn away. \n\n",

Ahab isn’t too fond of Micaiah’s prophesying, admitting to Jehosophat, “There is still one man who can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him because he never prophesies good about me, but only disaster” (1 Kings 22:8). \n\nKnowing this to be true, Ahab’s servant “who went to call Micaiah instructed him, ‘Look, the words of the prophets are unanimously favorable for the king. So let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably’” (v.13). The messenger wanted the Lord’s prophet to choose to side with the majority, to make things easy. But to Micaiah, the choice was not his to make. “As the LORD lives,” he says, “I will say whatever the LORD says to me” (v.14).\n\nAhab called four hundred prophets to assure him he would be victorious in battle—four hundred prophets who had been instructed by a lying, evil spirit to tell King Ahab what he wanted to hear: that he would be successful (vv.20–23). But Jehosophat, the king of Judah who’d been witness to all of this, did not trust them, which is why he’d asked to see “a prophet of the LORD” in the first place (v.7).\n\nUpon his arrival, “Micaiah told him, ‘March up and succeed. The LORD will hand it over to the king”—a message Ahab doesn’t believe because he doesn’t like the messenger (vv.15–16). And that’s when the Lord allows Micaiah to pull back the curtain to reveal Ahab’s true fate: “You see, the LORD has put a lying spirit into the mouth of all these prophets of yours, and the LORD has pronounced disaster against you” (vv.17,19–23). But Ahab does not listen, and he dies in battle (vv.29–38).\n\nMicaiah stood against the word of four hundred other prophets. He spoke the truth boldly to Ahab, who hated him. And he declared before them all, “I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and the whole heavenly army was standing by him at his right hand and at his left hand” (1 Kings 22:19). Micaiah chose to be obedient to the Lord who is enthroned above all kingdoms and rulers, all powers and principalities (Colossians 1:16; Ephesians 6:12; 1:20–23).\n\nThis is our reality as well, even when we choose to put someone or something else on the throne of our lives, elevating them above Him in our hearts. The truth of who God is does not change. He still graciously pursues us, drawing us into repentance, offering His mercy again and again, even in the midst of our sin (Romans 5:8). The one who has power over all shows compassion to those who fear Him (Psalm 103:12–13). “Bless the LORD, all his works in all the places where he rules. My soul, bless the LORD!” (v.22)\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nWay back in the Garden of Eden, our foreparents enjoyed a fleeting moment of sin-free existence. This meant, among other things, that separation was a foriegn concept to them. Adam and Eve were united with creation, united with each other, and united with their Creator. No sin was present to drive a wedge between their hearts and God’s. Unity was the natural order of things. In contrast, our lives are lived in the fallen world. Painful separations are nearly constant as a result. Sin separates hearts. Sin divides homes. Sin keeps us from Eden, pulling us away from perfect unity with our holy God. \n\nHere, in 2 Kings 2, Elisha was dealing with separation anxiety. His instincts told him he would soon be disconnected from his predecessor, Elijah. Everyone he met felt the need to confirm these suspicions but Elisha couldn’t seem to bear the thought. “Keep quiet,” he whispered when Elijah’s departure was mentioned (2 Kings 2:3)—as if failure to discuss it could have prevented him from losing someone dear. Every time Elijah tried to pull away, Elisha held on a little tighter. He refused to separate from his mentor one second before he had to. \n\nElisha must have known Elijah was heaven-bound. After seeing the ways God had used the life of his friend, he surely did not grieve without hope in God’s power and care. Any doubts that Elijah was heading somewhere better surely evaporated when he was taken up on chariots of fire within a supernatural whirlwind (vv.11–12). And yet, even when we know the promises of God to be true, even when we trust He has something more for us, separation stings. We simply weren’t built for it. \n\nWhen the moment of separation finally came, Elisha cried out, “My father, my father!” (v.12), tore his clothes, and sat down in the dirt, giving outward expression to His deep grief over the loss of Elijah. His words remind me of another moment in Scripture—the moment on the cross when the Son cried out in anguish to the Father:\n\n“About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out with a loud voice, ‘Elí, Elí, lemá sabachtháni?’ that is, ‘My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?’” (Matthew 27:46). \n\nJesus uttered these words right before the temple curtain was torn from top to bottom (Mark 15:38), an outward expressions of God’s power and His grace toward us. Jesus knew heaven was near and trusted the power and care of His Father, and yet, what He endured was tremendously painful. For once and for all time, our sinless Savior willingly endured the punishment for sins we deserved so that we might be united with Him again for all eternity.\n\nYes, this broken world is painful. We’re in good company if we respond with worried whispers and white knuckles when death comes for someone we love. But because of Jesus, separation is only temporary. Through the cross He built a bridge, a way back to Eden’s promise that someday we will be fully united with Christ, never to be separated again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nIn Genesis chapter 18, the Lord asked the patriarch Abraham this very important question: “Is anything impossible for the LORD?” (v.14). It was a rhetorical question, of course. I doubt that God was expecting Abraham to somehow calculate and answer Him based on some silly human formula. He was, after all, about to give Abraham a baby at the age of one hundred, and then use Abraham’s family line to birth both a nation and a Savior. \n\nThe answer to God’s question was “no,” of course—nothing is impossible for God. The angel Gabriel came right out with it when he told Mary she would become the mother of the world’s Savior (Luke 1:37). And Jesus Himself relayed the same truth in Matthew 19, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible” (v.26).\n\nA core belief in God’s unlimited power seems to be the backbone of Elisha’s ministry, a steel rod running through His life that allowed him to pray and serve with remarkable conviction, and with good cause. He had seen a number of astonishing miracles: wicked kings dethroned (1 Kings 22:37), armies consumed by fire from heaven (2 Kings 1:10), his mentor, Elijah, carried up into heaven in a whirlwind (2 Kings 2:11), and unhealthy water transformed into clean water with a pinch of salt (2 Kings 2:21–22).\n\nOver and over again, Elisha had a front row seat to the power of God. So when the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom commanded him to bring forth water from a dry ditch, Elisha’s faith was automatic, when he responded, “This is an easy thing in the LORD’s sight” (2 Kings 3:18).\n\nMaybe, like me, you’re tempted to compare notes with Elisha, to explain away weak faith with all you haven’t seen. True, I’ve never seen an army consumed with fire from heaven, and I haven’t watched anyone ride a whirlwind up to heaven. But I’ve seen the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living (Psalm 27:13). I’ve seen Him heal. I’ve felt His comfort. I’ve been transformed by His grace. \n\nWhen faced with the impossible, I press in to this truth: the greatest indicator of what God will do is what He has already done. He is a God who does not change, the healer who keeps healing, the deliverer who keeps delivering, and our Savior who keeps saving. \n\nGo on. Look around your life. Do you see the dry places where you need God’s Spirit to move? Dare to ask the angel’s question, “Is anything impossible for the Lord?” The answer is in every moment of goodness and mercy He has already shown you. May you pray with renewed confidence knowing that, whatever your need is, it is an easy thing in the Lord’s sight. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kimberly Girard\n\nWar, murder, and unthinkable tragedies are all a part of today’s reading. Yet even in the face of horrific evil, we see the Lord providing. From recovering an axe head to providing food to a starving people, the Lord provides again and again. The atrocities we see in the world around us, or even in our own hearts, can sometimes blind us from seeing the Lord at work on our behalf. But it is in the especially difficult seasons and situations that we need to pray, as Elisha did, that God would open our eyes to all the ways He provides for us.\n\nRecently, a good friend shared how, over the course of several weeks, she had prayed for eyes to see the ways the Lord provides for her family—and how He did just that, abundantly so. Her faith encouraged me to pray that the Lord would also open my eyes to see how He provides for my family. And it was unbelievable! He graciously revealed all the big and small ways He works to supply us with what we need, how He has been providing for us all along. In big and small and unexpected ways, I began to see that His provision was all around us—even in the form of a canceled baseball game that freed us up to enjoy a rare, unrushed afternoon.\n\nGod is in the details of our lives, just as surely as He was in the details of Elisha’s life. The prophet clearly saw the Lord’s provision, and He wanted his servant to see it too. \n\n“Then Elisha prayed, ‘LORD, please open his eyes and let him see.’  So the LORD opened the servant’s eyes,  and he saw that the mountain was covered with horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha” (2 Kings 6:17).\n\nWhen we are able to see beyond our myopic perception of the world—free to behold the reality of God’s glory and majesty, sovereignty and grace—that is a gift from Him. All Elisha did was humbly ask for God to open the servant’s eyes, to let him see God’s power in that moment, as it really is. \n\nSome days we may see huge, miraculous provision from Him, like those Elisha saw. Other days, we may see what seem like smaller glimpses of Him at work, and sometimes, we may be called to lean in to the promise of His presence. And on those days when we cannot see His provision at all, we are free to approach the throne of grace with confidence (Hebrews 4:16) and ask our Father to open our eyes, remembering that His ultimate provision for us is His Son, our Savior, Jesus Christ, who said, “Don’t be afraid, little flock, because your Father delights to give you the kingdom” (Luke 12:32).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Maria Furlough\n\nHow does it make you feel to hear someone blame God when bad things happen? Or when you find something difficult to understand or accept in Scripture—how does that affect you? For me, so many conflicting thoughts, theories, and perceptions can seep into my heart, creating doubt that threatens to weaken my faith. This is what I thought of when reading through today’s passages, when God calls Elisha to anoint Jehu as Israel’s king.\n\n“This is what the LORD God of Israel says: ‘I anoint you king  over the LORD’s people, Israel. You are to strike down the house  of your master Ahab so that I may avenge the blood shed by the hand of Jezebel— the blood of my servants the prophets and of all the servants of the LORD’” (2 Kings 9:6–7).\n\nI am so grateful that we know the context of all that came before this! Reading through 1 and 2 Kings, I am often reminded of why God’s story needs to be read straight through and in its entirety. Out of context, some pieces of the story do not fit, and can even seem to conflict. But with the whole story, we see God working in and through all things, which strengthens our hope in a powerful God, who is who He says He is and does what He says He will do. We see through the entirety of Scripture that God gives His people ample opportunities to reform, warning them that should they not repent and turn back to Him, the outcome will not be good. Still, they don’t always listen. \n\nBut rest assured, when God says something will happen, it will happen. In 2 Kings 9:22, King Jehu goes to Jezebel to fulfill what God predicted through the prophet Elijah fourteen years earlier (1 Kings 21:23–24). And so when Jehu obeys God’s command to kill Jezebel, who brought about “so much prostitution and sorcery,” his actions were “[fulfilling] the LORD’s word that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite” (2 Kings 9:36).\n\nThe God we serve is mighty and just. He cannot be overthrown and will not be mocked, yet He is gracious to give us fair warning as to where our sinful choices will ultimately lead us. Though these verses describing violent scenes might cause us to squirm, may we instead rest our eyes on our Savior, whose death and resurrection have brought us redemption and hope through His own blood being shed. These passages point to our need for salvation, our need for Jesus.\n\nThe God of Israel is the one “who does wonders… the whole earth is filled with his glory” (Psalm 72:18–19). Jehu trusted this, despite not fully understanding what God was doing. He knew that when God calls, you answer that call. When He commands, you obey. Through the difficult, uncomfortable, and hard-to-explain things of this life, may our devotion and zeal for the Lord sustain us in all situations (2 Kings 10:16).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Maria Furlough\n\nYes! The Israelites finally figured it out! God’s people are finally back in step with Him, and everything looks so promising (2 Kings 11:17). No more altars to worship Baal, no more Jezebel. Instead, a king has been appointed who will listen to instruction from the Lord’s priest. Israel has changed its ways! \n\nWe long for the complete demolishing of idolatry to be true in our own lives. Our very spirits grieve knowing that we were created for perfect unity with God, yet our sinfulness continually gets in the way. Like us, Israel doesn’t keep it together for long. “Throughout the time the priest Johoiada instructed him, Joash did what was right in the LORD’s sight. Yet the high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on the high places” (2 Kings 12:2–3). God’s people held on to just a few of their old ways. The Israelites wanted to serve God, but they wouldn’t do it fully. Old cultural habits would seep in and distract them and pull them away from worshiping the one true God. \n\nAt the onset, it’s tempting to judge the Israelites for their failures. We can look back and see all the ways God has proven Himself faithful. We see all the times they were warned about coming judgment and consequences, and we stand shocked at their perpetual disobedience. But are we really so different from them?\n\nIf I’m honest, sometimes I like a side dish of God while I leave the main course of my life to idol worship. I give my main allegiance to the high places I build up to worship such things as physical attractiveness, success, health, comfort, control, security, money. My altars may look different, but they still push God to the side. Still, God is faithful, even when I am not.\n\nGod never left Israel. Through all their division, defiance, and death, God always stayed true. He didn’t give up on them, and He will never give up on us. Despite their philandering hearts, “the LORD was gracious to them, had compassion on them, and turned toward them because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He was not willing to destroy them. Even now he has not banished them from his presence” (2 Kings 13:23).\n\nAt times we may become discouraged—sad that our world, our culture, our church, our neighborhood, or our school will never get it “right.” This sadness is right and good, because in our sorrow, we are agreeing with God that all is not as it should be. God knows this world is broken, and He knows us inside and out. He still loves us and always will. He pursues us with relentless passion. It is because of God’s determinate love that we have unstoppable hope. “Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion. It cannot be shaken” (Psalm 125:1). Yes, we should be diligent in tearing down any altars that threaten to lure our affection away from Christ—they all have to go—but our ability to trust in the Lord is sustained by Him alone. God’s story for Israel does not end in 2 Kings. It is only a part of God’s eternal love story with His people. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nEvery fall I get the strange urge to flip on a football game. Not because I particularly like, or even really understand, football. But because there is something cozy about a game playing in the background as I consume cheese-filled dips and nod off on the couch. Growing up, my family was into football, so I guess it brings a sense of familiarity. As one who doesn’t follow the sport with any real investment, I tend to cheer for whichever team is predicted to lose. There is just something compelling about an underdog. When all the odds are stacked against them, nobody believes they can pull it off. And yet, seemingly out of nowhere, they can make an interception and turn the whole game around in their favor. It’s not only the unexpected excitement of a good underdog story that I love, but also the perseverance of the team that I admire. \n\nThe Bible is full of underdog stories. One of the greatest underdog stories in the Bible is the story of Israel. God chose to perform His mightiest acts through a small, obscure people. In choosing to bless the world through the descendants of Abraham, the Lord backed the underdogs. Not the wealthiest or most powerful, Israel was ruled by broken rulers. Why would God choose this group of people? Perhaps so there could be no doubt about whose saving power was at work. \n\nDuring the reign of the wicked king Jeroboam son of Jehoash, the people were suffering, and “there was no one to help Israel” (2 Kings 14:26). God showed mercy to the Israelites because He had made a promise. And when God makes a promise, He does not break it. The Lord promised to preserve His people, so He saved them by the hand of their broken leader. It looked like they would meet their demise, but by the power of the Lord, the dry bones of Israel were given new life (Ezekiel 37:1–14).\n\nThis story should give us confidence in what the Lord has called us to. No matter what circumstances you may be facing, if the Lord has called you to a mighty work, He will see it through. You may feel like the underdog, with all the odds stacked against you, but you’re not in this fight alone. No, you have the great High King in your corner, and He cannot lose. You may be questioning the call God has placed in your heart, asking, Why would God choose me? But like Israel, God does not bestow His favor on those who are worthy, but on those whom He loves.\n\n“Let us not become weary in doing good,” but hold on to our hope in the Lord, continuing to fight the good fight (Galatians 6:9). God has the power to breathe new life into our bones, so me must drink deeply of His Spirit. In the end, we have nothing to sweat because Christ has already defeated death, and we will rise victorious by the power of His resurrection. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nMy first year of college I was blessed with a Southern roommate. We became the best of friends, but it wasn’t without some cultural clashes. One such example was when we stayed up late into the night debating the value of grits versus oatmeal, to the dismay of our third roommate. That year, I visited my friend’s childhood home over Thanksgiving break, and that is when my Yankee eyes were truly opened to the strong influences of the South. Surrounded by sweet tea, I found myself effortlessly adopting a phrase I’d sworn off completely: “y’all.” Not two weeks earlier, I’d argued, “It’s not even a real word!” Yet there I was, sounding as if I’d always been a Southern belle. \n\nIt’s a silly example of a larger principle. If we’re not careful, we can easily change our beliefs to fit our surroundings. This was certainly true for the Israelites. God established His covenant with them and taught them the right way to live, but they adopted the false gods of the nations they had defeated. They worshiped the idols around them even though they knew the one true God. The Lord warned them to turn back to Him through “every prophet and every seer” but they would not listen (2 Kings 17:13). And ultimately, God allowed them to become captives so they could realize their captivity. \n\nThere is a warning for us in this story—the question is whether or not we will heed it. We are all aware that today’s culture worships many idols: from financial status to career achievement, personal beauty to perfect-looking families. These things become idols when we bow down to them in worship. When we hang our happiness on their outcomes instead of turning to God for true joy. \n\nIf we’re really honest with ourselves, I’m guessing every one of us will find we struggle with some idol or another. None of us are perfect, and by the blood of Jesus, there is grace for that. But what should really scare us is that we so easily make the same mistakes Israel once made, when they “followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves” (2 Kings 17:15). \n\nIf we get so wrapped up in chasing the American Dream or building our social media platforms, we might look up one day and realize we’ve wasted our lives. We might find that we were only giving lip service to God, while giving actual power to much lesser things. Although the false gods of our culture don’t have literal golden shrines, they are very real and very seductive. And like Israel, we are at risk of ignoring the warning and willingly enslaving ourselves to idols that will never satisfy.\n\nLet’s not wait for the Lord to issue us a painful wakeup call before we turn back to Him. Let’s not waste weeks, months, or even years of our lives chasing idols that leave us wanting. Instead, may we listen to the warning from our God and direct our worship to Him. He alone can satisfy. He alone is good. “Let anyone who has ears listen” (Matthew 11:15). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nI remember waking up at night when I was a little girl and feeling the heat of a Florida summer in my grandparents’ house. Tiptoeing down the hallway that held childhood photos of my mom, her siblings, and a painting of Jesus (we’d always joke that He was the favorite child), I’d sneak into the bathroom for a sip of water, only to realize the adults were still awake. Quietly scurrying down the hallway and pausing where the carpet met the hardwood floors of the living room, I’d hide behind the entryway and listen in. \n\nMy Grandmother and Papa were almost always reading the Bible aloud to each other, taking turns reading chapters and nodding heads. Then, they’d bow their heads in prayer. I always felt an urge to leave when this happened, feeling that it was too intimate of a moment to secretly witness, but I was also extremely curious. What did adults talk about after the kids went to bed? What do they ask God for?\n\nSometimes I feel the same way when I read prayers in the Bible, and Hezekiah’s is no exception. He’d already declared, “Today day is a day of trouble” (2 Kings 19:3, NLT), and he was in deep mourning after receiving a report that confirmed the enemy’s dedication to to the destruction of Jerusalem. But as we read this account and get to peer into how someone else handles the darkness, there are two things that stand out.\n\nFirst, Hezekiah doesn’t sugarcoat his situation. He doesn’t ignore how bad it is or try to find the silver lining right away. He is in trouble, and he is honest about it. Second, he immediately takes it to the house of God. He doesn’t spend time strategizing solutions or wondering, Why me? He doesn’t try to clean up the situation before he invites God into the mess of it. \n\nGod does not call us to deny our circumstances, nor does He ask us to sit in them alone. The words of Hezekiah’s prayer weren’t as important as the act of his asking. The same goes for us when we want to take note of the eloquent phrases our loved ones use in prayer, or when we feel like we don’t have any words left. Prayer is not a one-sided speech; it is an ongoing invitation to conversation with God. May we approach our own prayers in the darkness in the same way. May we see them as an opportunity to invite God into our daily lives and ask Him to intervene on our behalf. And may we pursue God in prayer, seeking to glorify Him and acknowledge His goodness, even when both seem hidden to us. \n\n",

I don’t want to feel myself crying, and I definitely don’t want anyone to see my tears. \n\nOf course, most of the things we cry about are those we’d want to forget entirely, not write in a memoir. That was the case of Hezekiah when he became very ill, and while he prayed facing a wall (instead of in a parking lot), we can see that he, too, was in a very vulnerable position. In 2 Kings 20, we read the words of his prayer: “‘Please, LORD, remember how I have walked before you faithfully and wholeheartedly and have done what pleases you’” (v.3). And then he wept bitterly, and honestly before God. \n\nHezekiah’s prayer points to the old covenant, in which God blessed His people in response to their faithfulness to the covenant. In his most desperate time of need, Hezekiah asks God to validate whether or not he is worthy to approach the throne and ask for healing. And It’s easy to believe that this is the takeaway of Hezekiah’s story, that “good people” deserve good things. I don’t know about you, but that hasn’t always been my personal experience. \n\nThe most important part of this story isn’t Hezekiah’s healing, his ultimate death, or the end of his reign. It’s that under the new covenant, we no longer have to question our standing with God, because in Christ Jesus, we have been justified. Jesus died in our place so that, by placing our trust in Him, we could gain eternal life (Romans 6:23). \n\nThe Lord said to Hezekiah, “This is what the LORD God of your ancestor David says: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears,” (2 Kings 20:5). Because of Jesus’s work on the cross, the same God who acknowledges our every sorrow, is now present with us in all things (Psalm 56:8; John 14:15–31). Thanks be to God for all the ways He teaches us about our original sin under the old covenant, so that we may fully know the gift of His Son under the new covenant.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nHas anyone ever told you were were “too much”? I am such a shameless enthusiast that I often quietly remind myself to just calm down. Case in point: a few years ago I needed a juicer. But I couldn’t afford the one I wanted—nay, needed. Luckily I found one on Craigslist. Joy of joys! After exchanging about ten thrilling and delightful messages with the seller, out of the blue he hit me with this: “I am thinking there’s a game going on here. It would be better if you stopped emailing me, because you’re making this too hard. I won’t respond to you any more.”\n\nI blew the deal! All my overly enthusiastic nonsense pushed him away. Yes, it’s possible he wasn’t interested in hearing what I was planning to juice and for whom. Naturally, this wasn’t enough to deter me, so I asked my husband to reach out as a totally unrelated prospective buyer. They easily arranged the sale, and as my husband paid, the juice man confided, “You wouldn’t believe the crazy people I’ve had to deal with on Craigslist over this juicer!” To which my husband shook his head, “Don’t I know it.”\n\nMaybe I should calm down about juicing delicious fruits and vegetables and reserve my zeal for something that truly merits all my energy, but what if there were an appropriate reason to be “too much”? King Josiah would probably not be very popular today; in his day, some might have called him a fanatic. The kings of Judah before him just allowed the country to drift along in the idolatry of their neighbors. What’s more, even the kings that followed him fell back into the same pattern.\n\nBut the words of the Lord were real to Josiah, and he took them seriously. Josiah knew he had fallen deep into the idolatry of the world. The Word of God, like a two-edged sword (Hebrews 4:12), pierced Josiah with conviction and roused in him a zeal that may be foreign to many of us. Consider how fiercely and fervently he repented. If the Lord’s anger burned against it, Josiah was ready to smash it—idols, altars, towers, temples. He brought that same zeal to the whole of his kingdom, destroying every false idol and every false prophet in the land. He was a fanatic, and I think it’s safe to assume that many thought he was “too much.”\n\nBut look at the commendation he received from the Lord: “Before him there was no king like him who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength according to all the law of Moses, and no one like him arose after him” (2 Kings 23:25). Do you see it? He isn’t chided for overbearing zeal or reminded to calm down. Instead, he is lauded for keeping what Christ declared the first and greatest commandment: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength” (Mark 12:30). The first and greatest commandment is the territory of all us. And is this what it means to love the Lord with all your heart, mind, and strength—to give all your energy to the destruction of idols and the defense of God’s words? \n\nWhat if Josiah’s zeal wasn’t too much? What if it was the only right response to the conviction of God’s Word? The first and greatest commandment is the summation of the whole law of God, and it is this very commandment that Christ bids us to keep without wavering. Many of us live without much zeal, and some of us direct our zeal toward things that don’t matter. Instead, we should yield our hearts, all our enthusiasm—our heart, soul, mind, and strength—to the unchanging Word of the Lord. Go ahead and be “too much” for Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nAt the breakfast table this morning, I overheard a four-year-old eagerly explaining the key to getting what he wants: “I just ask, and ask, and ask, and ask until Mama says yes.” Okay, it was my four-year-old. And I usually do give in to him after he has asked seven times. Tired isn’t even the word for how this makes me feel. His simple solution to getting what he wants is actually a really terrible solution. What I want to teach my kids is this: ask, learn, and then obey. Let’s just say that his commitment to setting up his own standard of what is right and wrong is why he still has to take a nap every day.\n\nWe ask God questions all the time. And if we don’t like the answer we get, we ask, and ask, and ask, and ask again. But here’s the thing: God doesn’t get squishy and worn out and depressed about life situations—He is unchanging. So the hilariously pushy methods that sometimes work on parents (and teachers and bosses) don’t change eternal truth. We can’t insist on getting our own way with Him. In a culture that is driven by individualistic self interest, we are lured to believe the opposite—that we can choose what is right.\n\nBut the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). And even though God loved Judah, He sent them into exile and allowed Jerusalem to be destroyed (2 Kings 25:21). These same events are recorded in the book of Jeremiah. As one of the Lord’s prophets, Jeremiah warned Jehoiakim, who warned Jehoiachin, who warned Zedekiah—and he witnessed the judgment God brought against each of these kings. But folly came after folly, and they didn’t listen. \n\n“You have seen all the disaster I brought against Jerusalem…  because of the evil they committed to anger me…  So I sent you all my servants the prophets time and time again, saying,  ‘Don’t commit this detestable action that I hate.’  But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their evil” (Jeremiah 44:2–5).\n\nLike children, we want our own way and don’t want to listen. But we are called to heed God’s ways and His words. Don’t accept a sham when the truth is available to you. We don’t have to pretend to be Christians; we are His children. Jerusalem was on the road to destruction because they refused to listen to the Lord and instead substituted their own truth for the truth of God’s Word. \n\nBut we must be of good hope, because God does generously give us His answers and teach us about His ways and His character through Scripture. Listen today and pay attention. Why push your own truth forward when eternal truth is available to you? Write His words on the tablet of your heart and when you are in need—or busy or scared or overwhelmed or somehow “squishy” and not at your best—they will stay with you (Deuteronomy 11:18).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 1:1-11, Deuteronomy 30:1-5, Deuteronomy 30:11-15, Hebrews 7:25\n\nBack in 2014, when the She Reads Truth community was not quite two years old, Raechel and I felt called to something unexpected and, frankly, a little terrifying. Feeling a kinship to Nehemiah and his call to rebuild the walls of his city to establish a safe place for his people to gather and worship, we believed the Lord laid it on our hearts to build a Bible app with our Shes—a place for them read Truth together, every day. As that app was being built, the community read Nehemiah—some with the very first She Reads Truth study book in hand. \n\nToday, four years later, we are reading Nehemiah together once again. \n\nThe Lord has done remarkable things in this community of Bible-readers in those four years. So many women have opened their Bibles for the first time—or for the first time in a long time—and have kept coming back, day after day. Together, we’ve approached God’s Word again and again as days and weeks have stretched into months and years. And together, we’ve marveled at what we’ve found: God is still faithful, and His Word is still true. \n\nWhen Nehemiah heard that Jerusalem’s walls had been destroyed and her gates burned to the ground, he was devastated. As he wept for his home and his people, he did the one thing he knew to do: he sought the Lord. With prayer and fasting and confession, Nehemiah petitioned the Lord on behalf of Jerusalem. He declared God’s goodness and recalled God’s faithfulness. He spoke the Lord’s promises  back to Him, believing those promises to be true while also petitioning the Lord to act on them. \n\nNehemiah longed for his city to be restored, and we can guess from the gumption we’ll see from him in later chapters that he felt a fire inside to bring about that restoration with his own two hands. But before he put a hand to a hammer, he bowed his knees in prayer. In his humility we see a truth confirmed throughout Scripture: any sense of calling we have, even those directly related to our faith in Christ, rests on the strength, sovereignty, and grace found only in Him. Any good work is God’s work. He invites and equips us to participate in it, which we do by faith in Him, not in ourselves. \n\nAs we read this Old Testament narrative together over the next three weeks, we’ll see how God indeed called Nehemiah to lead the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s wall. But today, as we read this prayer from a broken man for his broken city, may we, too, begin with prayer and confession. Let’s declare God’s goodness and recall His faithfulness. Let’s speak His promises back to Him, knowing that He has both fulfilled them and is fulfilling them right where we are. \n\nMay the Holy Spirit teach us more about God the Father and Christ the Son as we read this book together. And may God give us strength and courage for whatever work He puts before us—both the grand endeavors and the single acts of faithfulness—to the honor and glory of His name.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 2:1-10, Psalm 137:1-9, Hebrews 12:18-24\n\nHave you ever been so worried you couldn’t do your job? You’re supposed to be watercolor painting, but all you can think about is the outcome of your mom’s surgery? Or you’ve tried to be present in a classroom full of third graders, but you can hardly see their faces because all you can think about is the broken heart of your sister? Beyond even these pains, have you ever felt a burning passion that you might be called to something else while you must continue to intone, “Thank you for your purchase, have a nice day”?\n\nI imagine this is how Nehemiah felt as he worked in the service of King Artaxerxes. He had a great job, but while working, he heard really terrible news from Jerusalem: The walls are down! The gates are burned! Our people are living in shame! (Nehemiah 1:3). This news was heartbreaking for him. \n\nThe first thing Nehemiah did was pray. But then he went back to work. For about four months, he showed up to work every day and did his job, not saying a word about his own personal bad news, even though his heart ached. It’s shocking how the world mercilessly grinds forward in spite of our personal griefs. Regardless, sometimes we just have to show up and keep on doing our work.\n\nDuring this time Nehemiah prayed continually and earnestly. And even though he hadn’t breathed a word of his personal anguish to the king, the king saw it written on his face and reached out to him, saying, “Why are you sad?” Nehemiah then confessed his heartbreak, to which the king immediately asked, “What is your request?” (2:2,4).\n\nAnd here is a wonderful moment. The very thing he had longed for—a chance to get exactly what he needed to rebuild Jerusalem—appeared right in front of his nose: a king ready to hear his request, with all the power of the Persian empire in his hands. What did Nehemiah do? Rush in with his five-year plan? Build a case to woo the king’s heart to support his passion project? No. None of that. The first thing Nehemiah did was pray. As my pastor, George Grant, would say, “Instead of running to the throne of the world, [Nehemiah] runs to the throne of the Lord.”\n\nNehemiah was a man committed to prayer. And once he had prayed, he was a man ready for hard work. He asked the king to send him to rebuild the city and a people. By trade, Nehemiah was a white collar palace worker; he attended the king and brought him wine. He wasn’t a city planner, and he didn’t have experience rebuilding walls. But God had called him to rebuild a city, and Nehemiah was a willing worker.\n\nWhether he was working for the king in Persia or rebuilding his homeland in Jerusalem, Nehemiah worked for the Lord. This can be such a difficult and painful thing to do. As the psalmist cries out, “How can we sing the Lord’s song on foreign soil?”(Psalm 137:4). How can we continue to praise the Lord when things are terrible, when everything has gone spectacularly wrong? How can we obey when obedience is the furthest thing from our hearts? By continually turning to the Lord in prayer. \n\nBefore we decide what to do: pray.\nBefore we do it: pray.\nAfter we begin: pray.\n\nIn this manner, our relationship with God is written on all the hours of our days. May we learn to humble ourselves before Him and submit our requests to Him, instead of bowing to the powers of this world. May our lives become a song of prayer unto the Lord.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 2:11-20, Isaiah 62:8-12, Ephesians 2:19-22, James 2:14-26\n\nAsk any of my friends and they will tell you this: I am terrible at the game of Jenga. It’s the one with wooden blocks stacked tall and intricately as a puzzle of sorts, criss-crossed in a stack that begs to remain unbroken. And yet, that is exactly the point of the game: taking turns slowly choosing just the right block to strategically remove, all while keeping the tower standing and intact. The first few rounds include some easy takeaways, but as the blocks continue to be removed the chances of the tower tumbling increase. And trust me, you do not want to be the one choosing the wrong block, causing the tumble, and ending the game. \n\nMany days, it feels as if tragedy is looming and pain is just around the corner. Afraid, we don’t want to be the one to make our joys tumble into sadness, or witness our hopes disintegrating into ruin. No one wants to fall.\n\nJerusalem’s wall fell. Torn down and destroyed by fire, the walls and gates surrounding Nehemiah’s beloved city whispered a disgraceful story of shame and abandonment. Like standing beside a spilled tower of blocks, Jerusalem was filled with nothing but past memories and lost hopes. That is, until Nehemiah showed up with plans only God could have laid on His heart: \n\n“You see the trouble we are in. Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been burned. Come, let’s rebuild Jerusalem’s wall, so that we will no longer be a disgrace” (Nehemiah 2:17).\n\nWhile we fear destruction and are anticipating all the ways we could mess things up, God has already planned restoration. Where we stand in ruin, He sees new creation. \n\nUnfortunately, I have a hard time remembering this truth when I’m in the midst of painful circumstances. And every time I choose the wrong Jenga block, so to speak, I vow to never play again, wondering what I could have done differently to avoid pain. The thought that doesn’t cross my mind so easily is this: rebuild. I don’t see the point in stacking the blocks up again, only to fall once more.\n\nBut rebuilding is not an afterthought to God. Restoration and redemption are His priority. By God’s mercy, He allows our eyes to see glimpses of the restoration plan and invites our hands and hearts into the work. Nehemiah trusted in the good work God was doing through him, even when he could not yet envision the final product. He knew the God of the heavens would grant them success (v.20).\n\nA new wall for Jerusalem meant much more than one more round of Jenga. The rebuilt walls protected a temple, creating a safe and sacred space for worship. In the same way, our God is always building us up to know and adore Him more. This is true restoration. Thanks be to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 3:1-32, Romans 12:3-8, Psalm 8:1\n\nSummer 2017 was a doozy for hurricanes. We could hardly flip on the television or open Twitter without seeing brutal images of destruction, people desperate for power and food, and endless press conferences from emergency officials. In Houston and Florida and Puerto Rico—the storms came in vicious waves.\n\nWhen the storms stopped, aid rushed in from all corners. The money came from donors big and small, celebrities and ordinary people alike. Houston Texans defensive end JJ Watt raised millions of dollars for recovery in Houston. Celebrity chef José Andrés and his non-profit cooked more than three million meals for people without power in Puerto Rico. Alongside many of his famous friends, Lin-Manuel Miranda—creator and star of the Broadway musical Hamilton—recorded a song for Puerto Rico and dedicated the profits to relief efforts.\n\nHouston and Puerto Rico are still recovering, and it will take decades to rebuild them both. I don’t want to assume the efforts of these varied groups of people allow us to tie these devastating events up with a pretty bow, or draw moralistic and clichéd conclusions about how disasters bring people together. These aren’t joyful barn raisings; they are the direct result of tragedy.\n\nWe see the same in the book of Nehemiah. Jerusalem was burned and pillaged by the Babylonians. God’s people had repeatedly turned away from Him, and they were displaced, their homes destroyed. But when the time came to return and rebuild, a diverse group of people banded together to do the work.\n\nIn Nehemiah 3, the author records at least 43 distinct groups or named persons who rebuilt the gates and the walls around Jerusalem. They were all types of people: the high priest Eliashib (v.1); the Tekoites (v.5); the daughters of Shallum, who was the son of the ruler of half of Jerusalem (v.12); Hashabiah, who was the ruler of his own district (v.17); temple servants (v.26); goldsmiths and merchants (v.31).\n\nThey were rulers and servants, men and women, tradesmen and priests. The work knew no distinction between rich and poor, the same way the tragedy of the exile touched every person in Israel and Judah. Tragedies flatten. They knock down walls and homes indiscriminately, across class, race, gender, and age. And when it comes time to rebuild, the work falls on everyone as well.\n\nNehemiah 3 is a story, not just a list of who did what while rebuilding the gates. It’s a story of a broken people finding their way home again, and then laying aside titles, traditional roles, and expectations to build the walls around their city. Not unlike the body of Christ the apostle Paul describes in Romans 12, those who rebuilt Jerusalem’s walls worked as one body with many parts (v.4).\n\nAnd while Nehemiah 3 isn’t really our story, one of the beautiful gifts of the gospel is that it is for everyone. We are all flattened by sin, by the tragedy of the fall. But rather than each of us doing the hard, back-breaking work of redeeming and rebuilding our own hearts, our story has a different ending. No matter how hard we work, whether individually or together, we cannot fix sin. Instead, we all have to rely on the power and work of one person alone: Jesus Christ. \n\n Thanks be to God!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Rose\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 4:1-23, Genesis 28:15, Ephesians 1:18-23\n\nIn my second year of college, I flunked out. Well, maybe not “flunked out,” but I was definitely placed on academic probation. I couldn’t take classes at the university for a full year. Humiliated and miserable, I returned home to wait out my year off. I took that year very seriously. With the help of a coach, I learned the value of delayed gratification and self-governance. It was the hardest work I’d ever undertaken, and that hard work paid off when I returned and graduated.\n\nA few years later, I decided I wanted to get healthy. Eating well and exercising were more challenging than I’d expected, and there were several times I wanted to give up. But each time I felt overwhelmed, I remembered the hard work of teaching myself to self-govern and to delay immediate gratification, and how those skills had earned me a diploma. Remembering these things spurred me on toward health. \n\nIn Scripture, the command to “remember” certain things is common. The Israelites were instructed to remember God delivered them from slavery in Egypt (Exodus 13:3), and they were charged with committing the law to their memory (34:27). Similarly, the New Testament church was instructed to remember the victorious work of Christ on the cross through observing holy communion (Luke 22:7-19). It seems that “remembering” is the bridge that connects the past to the future—a present action that recalls the past and serves to propel us into our future. \n\nThe author of Nehemiah is recounting an experience during the rebuilding of the wall, when the circumstances of the present seem to be overwhelming the promise of the future. External forces were devising a plan to obstruct the building of Jerusalem’s walls. The opposition first tried to plant seeds of doubt. They hurled taunts and ridicule as the Jews were beginning their work, yet the Jewish builders persisted. But when they were about halfway through, the naysayers decided to destroy the work. \n\nUnderstandably, the prospect of battle put fear in the hearts of the Jews who were working, and they began to doubt. Nehemiah assessed the danger and found that it was indeed very real. And so he told the workers to outfit themselves with the accoutrements of battle, and he directed them to “remember the great and awe-inspiring God” (Nehemiah 4:14). \n\nAnd remember they did. They remembered the battles previously fought and won with Jehovah as their commander-in-chief, and they prepared to fight to protect their wives, their children, and the future of their holy city, Jerusalem. The remembering brought them strength—not just strength to arm themselves, but strength to continue the work. \n\nToday, I’m encouraged to continue the work God has called me to, remembering His faithfulness in my past. The opposition of my present circumstances might be a very real threat—funky finances, a broken relationship, systemic injustice—but today I choose to remember the character and promises of the God I serve. \n\n“Look, I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go. I will bring you back to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”-Genesis 28:15\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 5:1-19, Exodus 22:25, 2 Corinthians 8:9\n\nI’m no bargain hunter when it comes to shopping and did not inherit whatever gene it is my grandmother and mother and at least three of my brothers seem to have. I want and weigh and debate and discuss until finally I buy at full price. There is one place, though, where I have no problem hunting for bargains: my standing before God. \n\nIt seems I’m always being measured and measuring myself up against the standards of others, and therefore, against the standard of God. Unconsciously, I list my good deeds against my less than good deeds and, finding myself short, try to make it up to God. \n\nI’ll be more faithful here.\nI’ll give more of myself there.\nI’ll be a better friend here.\nA better wife there.\nI’ll be quick to say I’m sorry here.\nAnd I’ll be slow to take offense there.\nSurely the scales will be weighed and I’ll not be found wanting?\nSurely my generosity must count for something?\n\nWhat I love about Nehemiah chapter 5 is that while Nehemiah is a man who is known and loved by God and loves Him in return, somehow he still feels the need to present his list of good deeds before God. It’s as if he is a small child who’s come in from a long day of playing outside to then dump out the contents of his pockets and present them as treasures before his father.\n\nI found this rock and this stick.\nLook at this leaf and this frog.\nI played with this boy and then we built this fort.\nCome see it…\n\nAnd instead of ignoring or rebuking the child for distracting him, the father delights in the boy’s account. This child is not earning the love of his father; he is simply overflowing with the gift of who and what he is—a child, about the work of being a child, doing the things a child does, and certain in the love of his father.\n\nIt is not a bargain Nehemiah is on the hunt for here. He’s not listing his deeds to God in order to gain His approval. He knows who he is and what he is called to do: rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and call the people to repentance. It is not scales on which Nehemiah lays the goodness of his deeds—it is for the delight of his Father. \n\nWe know that as children of God, our “good deeds” are like filthy rags before the goodness of Christ (Isaiah 64:6). We are fully covered in the sacrifice of Christ’s death; therefore, we can no more justify our good deeds or count our bad ones against us. Jesus’ work on the cross is complete, as is our justification through Him (Galatians 2:16).\n\nSo since we are children of God, as we go about our lives today, let’s not tally mark our good deeds or our  bad ones, but instead be about our Father’s business, being faithful with what He has called us to today. And at the end of the day, whether we’re tempted to feel self-sufficient and justified or ashamed and unworthy, based on what we did or did not accomplish—let us instead empty our hearts before the Father and show Him the treasures of a life lived in faithfulness for our joy and His glory.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 6:1-19, Isaiah 9:6-7, Jeremiah 23:5-6\n\nWhether it’s creeping doubts or, in the case of Nehemiah, a determined band of enemies with names like Sanballat (boo!), the work that Christ has for us rarely goes unopposed. \n\nAs I consider the ways God has used His Word to call me to serve and go and share, I am bolstered by Nehemiah’s tenacious faithfulness. Though his opponents sought to distract and discourage him, Nehemiah stood firm. His eyes were on the prize. His mission was God’s glory. His feet were firmly planted in the idea that he was building something bigger than himself. When his enemies accused him of plotting a coup to take the throne, Nehemiah simply sent this message:\n\n“I am doing a great work and I cannot come down” (Nehemiah 6:3). \n\nHis words have the power to equip and encourage us. As we minister, as we obey, as we ask God to shape us into the image-bearers we were made to become, the voice of the enemy will continuously ring in our ears. But we do not have to listen. Christ is doing an important work in us, after all. There’s more to see. Nehemiah is pointing us toward something bigger. \n\nFast forward nearly 500 years past the construction of Nehemiah’s wall. Jesus, our Savior, hangs on a cross. Just like Nehemiah, Christ’s enemies accused Him of vying for a human throne. A sign carved by hatred was placed above His head, declaring sarcastically, “This is Jesus, King of the Jews” (Matthew 27:37). Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and the rest stood at the base of Nehemiah’s wall and hurled insults. \n\nChrist’s accusers stood at the base of the cross and did the same. \n\n“He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him” (Matthew 27:42). \n\nJesus didn’t flinch. He didn’t rush to His own defense. He didn’t climb off the cross and put His opponents in their place, though He certainly could have. His eyes were glued to the Father, and His mission was our salvation. With His actions Christ was, in essence, declaring, “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down.”\n\nNehemiah rebuilt the temple walls, and Jesus rebuilt the temple. Nehemiah stayed the course until the wall was finished, and Jesus stayed on the cross until the veil was torn. Nehemiah couldn’t have known it, but he was declaring the gospel with his life and work. Because Jesus was not deterred by His accusers, we can declare the same.\n\nI reckon Nehemiah would tell us there is no cost to count when compared to the privilege of pointing to Jesus. And through His death, Jesus declares there is no cost too high to pay in order to ransom us. With the gospel as our grid, we can stay the course, embracing Christ’s words as He reminds us, \n\n“If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life because of me will save it” (Luke 9:23-24).\n\nPick up your cross. Tune out the enemy. Let’s keep building.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 7:1-73, Exodus 28:29-30, Psalm 34:19-22\n\nYES! Genealogies!! Who needs stories when you can just cozy up with a good list of who begat whom, am I right? I bet you love them just a little bit too. I mean, who hasn’t gotten the chills from the genealogy at the end of Ruth, when you realize she fits right into the line of Judah and became the great grandmother of King David? That list prompts the realization that God had a plan for our sweet Ruth all along. Genealogies show us God’s sovereign plan for our salvation and His intimate love for individual people.\n\nWhen Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem, he needed to do more than stack bricks and hang gates; he needed to rebuild a people. These people were born into exile. They had never actually seen Jerusalem. They’d only heard stories about it. All they knew was life without a home, without traditions, and without community. They had nothing. So as Nehemiah began to rebuild Jerusalem, he also had to learn how to rebuild a people. And each one of those people mattered. \n\nThis genealogy in Nehemiah chapter 7 is a list of the Israelites released by Cyrus from exile in 538 BC. It’s a wonderfully meticulous list that even includes the number of mules that moved back to the city (there were 245). More importantly, it tells us a lot about who these people were, and how much people matter to God. In verse 7, twelve leaders are listed, and those twelve are representatives of the twelve tribes—showing us that they’re not just a part of the covenant, but are once again whole and entitled to the full blessings of God’s covenant promises.\n\nEach family’s descendants are also counted. Some families were massive (Senaah had 3,930 descendants!), and some families’ reunions were more modest (Beth Azmaveth had only 42). Regardless of how large or small, they were counted as families and not all heaped together, because individuals and families matter to God.\n\nPriests, Levites, musicians, and gatekeepers were also counted, indicating that our callings matter to God. Temple servants are listed using their foreign names because they were not Hebrew-born, having joined with Israel through conversion to their God. Because God redeems the lives of His servants (Psalm 34:22), He makes them equal inheritors of the covenant with those who could trace their lineage all the way back to Abraham.\n\nAnd finally, there were some who searched the records but were unable to discover their heritage because their families had been so torn apart by the exile. These, too, are listed, and their value is not diminished. Children born into captivity are valued just the same, regardless of their parentage.\n\nFrom there, the people settled back into their towns and began to knit their lives together. That’s as close as we get to “happily every after” in the book of Nehemiah. But in reading this book, we see that God’s eye is always on His people, restoring not just a broken city, but a broken people as well. He cares about each one of us, our families, our homes, and our lives. And if we are in Christ, we are co-inheritors of His covenant blessings just as much as any son of Abraham. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 7:73, Nehemiah 8:1-18, Romans 1:16-17, 2 Timothy 3:16-17\n\nDo you remember the first time you understood a crucial part of the gospel? The day something just clicked? You knew the words of it one day, but in that one moment you understood the absolute truth of it. For me one of those “Aha!” moments happened when I came to understand the Bible wasn’t primarily a book about me, but rather a book about God. \n\nThat may seem silly to some. It may be something every Sunday School kid armed with The Jesus Storybook Bible already knows. But for me, as a 30-year-old woman, it was astounding to realize that my entire life I had read the Bible one way, when it was intended to be read an entirely different way. It changed everything for me. It made the gospel come alive to me. It made Scripture come alive to me. It made Jesus come alive to me. \n\nBut it also made my sin more real to me. \n\nI was rejoicing because this book held the words of life, but I was weeping because this book also showed me my sin. It wasn’t just a book about how if I did good things, good things would happen in return for me. It wasn’t just a book of stories about that “nice man” Jesus. It wasn’t a book that held the key to getting an eternity with God. It was a whole book that had to be believed in its entirety—even the really hard bits.\n\nI imagine this is how the Israelites felt when the book of the law was read to them. The weightiness of all the ways they couldn’t measure up were read clearly to them so the people could understand it fully. And as we would expect, they wanted to mourn and weep, because who could keep a law like this one? But look what Nehemiah says to them—and to us, who still sometimes buckle under the weight of a law fulfilled: \n\n“Do not grieve, because the joy of the Lord is your strength” (Nehemiah 8:10).\n\nThe same strength given to those who did not yet have full understanding of God’s redemptive plan is given to us today when we understand the full weight of Scripture, our sin, and the Savior’s sacrifice. The joy of the Lord is our strength when under the weight of conviction and in the midst of mourning our sin. \n\nThe joy of the Lord, the goodness of His sovereign plan and His deep love, His careful attention and His unmerited mercy—these are why we can rejoice in the face of what seems terribly, terribly hard, irrevocably broken, or unattainably high. We can trust in the joy of the Lord.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 9:1-37, 2 Corinthians 1:20-22\n\nThe last thing you want after a long week away is a bad ride home from the airport. But that’s where I found myself last week, hailing an Uber ride from the arrivals entrance. A frequent traveler, I typically enjoy these modern-day “cabs.” The driver who came to pick me up late that night was kind and hospitable, hoisting my luggage into the trunk and respecting my lack of desire to make small talk. Like I said, it had been a long week, and I was grateful for the relative quiet.\n\nMy ride home from the airport should have been simple—one I could probably drive with my eyes closed. That’s why I noticed the two U-turns, the missed stop sign, the turnaround in a grocery store parking lot, and the driver who became increasingly silent. Maybe I should have spoken up sooner, but when I finally asked, “Where are we?” it was because I already knew the answer: we were lost. Very, very lost. The driver had missed the intended destination entirely. \n\nThe word “sin” comes from the idea of failure, “the act or state of missing the mark.” I confess that every time I sin, I am acting out of my humanity and turning my heart away from my Father. I turn away from the intended place He has created for me: living in His presence and in relationship with Him. In day-to-day life sin can become much more than just my actions; it can begin to feel more like my permanent residence. \n\nLike the embarrassed apology my driver made when we finally made it home, returning to the reality of my sin always makes me feel ashamed. But in Nehemiah 9, we have an opportunity to reframe this together, watching as the children of Israel gather together to confess their sin. However, instead of being driven by guilt, they are empowered by celebration. Just days after the feast of the tabernacles, one of the most joyful parties they’d ever had, they paused to realign their hearts with God’s—not because they were hurt or afraid, but because they were thankful.\n\nIt is a grace that God “[acts] faithfully, while we have acted wickedly” (Nehemiah 9:33). It is a gift that He keeps covenants, even when we do not. At the intersection of our lack and His goodness, may we return to Him, remembering and cherishing what it is to be considered His. All promises are “yes” in the Savior who calls His wandering children home, again and again (2 Corinthians 1:20).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 9:38, Nehemiah 10:1-39, John 14:15, Hebrews 4:15\n\nFind me managing a tantrum in the middle of the bread aisle and I might sing a different tune, but I want more from my children than blind obedience. I don’t want them to toe the line based strictly on fear of consequences. Our home is not a police state, after all. I want my children’s obedience to reflect the condition of their hearts, for their actions to be a response to the love and care they’ve been given. \n\nAs I consider my role in the family of God, I know the Father wants the same from me. As an unbeliever, I couldn’t work up the oomph to care much about what God said about how I should live. At best, He seemed like an aloof father figure, and at worst, an unreasonable tyrant. Like a toddler determined to have her own way, I rebelled. \n\nAs a new believer, I swung the pendulum of obedience to extremes. I wanted to obey all the rules, do all the right things, avoid all the wrong ones. I saw God as a hyper-attentive helicopter parent. I lived in constant fear of disappointing Him. But I’ve been walking with Christ for twenty years now, and a beautiful shift has transpired. Much like what happened with my earthly parents as I hit my mid-twenties, I want to please God—not because of fear of consequences, but because He is so clearly worthy of my unequivocal devotion and respect. Rather than being motivated by fear, my obedience has become the way I say “thank you” for all He has done for me. \n\nHere, in Nehemiah 9-10, we see God’s people growing up, maturing. They’ve been through a rebellious phase, and it has cost them dearly. In the eras preceding Nehemiah’s day, God’s people saw Him as an oppressive and unreasonable Father, and their warped view of Him fueled generations of rebellion. But because He is a loving Father, He graciously gathered them together again. He reminded them of His expectations and gave them another chance to get it right. They looked around at their scattered tribes, their rubbled city, their fallen comrades, and their perspective shifted. \n\nGod is good.\nHis ways are best.\nRebellion leads to destruction.\n\nFor all of chapter 10, God’s children declared what they would and would not do in response to God’s love. We’ve heard it all before, but the tone is different here. Just like the children I tuck into bed every night, they would not obey perfectly, but their hearts had changed. For the first time in a long time, they wanted to obey their Father. In all things, they were determined to “not neglect the house of God” (Nehemiah 10:39).\n\nLove and obedience are tied together with a sacred cord. That’s why Christ cut to the chase with these words: “If you love me, you will keep my commands” (John 14:15). Author Paul David Tripp puts it this way: “Obedience is not what gets you grace. It’s the evidence that grace has gotten you.” Belief leads to obedience, because when we see who God really is, we want to live like He asks us to. It is our loving response to the God who is Love.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 11:1-21, Deuteronomy 7:9, Hebrews 11:13-16\n\nTwo summers ago, one of my best friends went to Greece. He didn’t go to see the Acropolis or the Parthenon, or to eat feta and olives by the handful. Instead, he spent several months on the island of Lesbos tending to thousands of refugees who had flooded there from war-ravaged Syria.\n\nHe sent pictures of little children, of lines of people waiting for blankets and clothes, of tents, of towers made of life jackets used to keep people afloat after their lifeboats sank. And he sent one picture of a fence post with these words scribbled across it, a holy graffiti: On earth as it is in heaven.\n\nEvery text, every story, every picture made me catch my breath and whisper a prayer. If you search online for his camp, you see headlines with words like “trapped” and “welcome to prison,” “horrific” and “languishing.” A few months after he left, his camp burned to ground. Tears flow as I write this, just thinking about it.\n\nThe people of God were hardly strangers to displacement. I hesitate to pull a direct parallel to the refugees from Syria, because in reading Nehemiah 11 we see a cautious return to their forsaken home. The Syrian refugees haven’t had that yet (and may not), and it feels odd to use them as an illustration here without being able to do something to ease the tragedy of their situation. But I believe we have to sit in that together, and feel the unease and discomfort.\n\nWe know that God’s people felt the pain of being dispersed during the exile. They were torn apart from their families, and they watched their cities burn. But now, at the end of Nehemiah, Jerusalem was ready. The walls were strong again. And yet, the people didn’t come willingly.\n\nNehemiah 11:1-2 tells us that they had to cast lots to decide who had to live in Jerusalem. They blessed the people who volunteered to live there. Why? Because Jerusalem would be the target of all of Israel’s enemies. John Wesley described the situation so poetically in his commentary on Nehemiah, saying, “This city was the butt of all the malicious plots of their enemies.” The return to David’s holy city wasn’t marked by a parade, by triumphant singing, or by celebration. It was marked by trepidation, a slow and careful entrance into the city that God had given them once again.\n\nI can imagine the Israelites were tired, limping across a finish line that still didn’t seem ideal. They were home, but they still had only the Lord to keep them safe. They knew the walls of Jerusalem had been burned once, and they could be burned again.\n\nLike the Israelites, we are still seeking a safe haven, a homeland. We, too, serve a God who is preparing a city for us—a heavenly city, where there will be no need for walls to protect us because we will dwell with God in perfect peace forever (Hebrews 11:16).\n\nThese promises from God remind me of the hymn “Guide Me O Thou Great Jehovah.” It is the mournful cry of a pilgrim people who know that one day, we will be home.\n\nWhen I tread the verge of Jordan,\nbid my anxious fears subside.\nDeath of death, and hell’s destruction,\nLand me safe on Canaan’s side.\n…\nLand me safe on Canaan’s side,\nbid my anxious fears,\nbid my anxious fears goodbye.\n\n",

It wasn’t because I was a bad reader. In fact, I always read a bit faster than everyone else, skipping ahead to read a paragraph or two before the rest of the class. But even still, I was constantly nervous I would say something wrong or lose my place in the reading, and as a result, make a fool of myself if called on by the teacher. \n\nIt’s easy to get lost in this passage from Nehemiah 11 and 12, because it’s full of the names of people and places that are hard to read and even harder to pronounce. It’s also easy to acknowledge that there are a lot of names, decide they’re too difficult to pronounce, and then skip ahead to the more interesting part of the story. \n\nBut names are important. The names in this passage are the names of the priests who came back to live in Jerusalem. At the time, Jerusalem wasn’t exactly the hip, new place to live. It was dangerous to the point that the people had to cast lots to see who would go back and build their lives there. The names of these priests listed in Nehemiah 11 and 12 are the priests who took the risk, voluntarily or not, because the people moving to Jerusalem needed priests too. \n\nThese lists tell us more than just who these people were; they tell us where they came from, their history. There is a lot of interest nowadays in finding out more about your ancestry. You send in a sample of your DNA, and some laboratory sends you back a full report of your global ancestry. Human nature leans toward wanting more knowledge, more information, which is probably why these kinds of tests have become so popular. We just want to know what we want to know. \n\nThese lists of priests serve a similar purpose: to help future generations of priests know where they came from. When we know where we come from, it’s easier to know what we’re moving toward, to take a glimpse at the bigger picture. But our full understanding of where we come from lies in the knowledge and belief of this truth: our citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20). \n\nOur most important family name is the one given to us as children of God. We are His sons and daughters, and He is our Father. We belong to Him. He is our ancestry. He is our past, present, and future. Our citizenship and our family name rests fully with Him, and Him alone.\n\n",

New baby, new job, new spouse, new house, renovated house, new car, reupholstered car, birthday, anniversary, church holiday, national holiday—doesn’t matter. I’m here for the celebration. There’s something special about gathering with a group of people for a purpose that isn’t work-related, where the only objective is to have a great time. I have to admit, I’ve walked past a group of strangers having a party at a restaurant and secretly wished I could take part in their merry-making. \n\nIn reading today’s passage, I was happy to see I’m not the only one who likes to have a good time. When the wall was completed and the time came to dedicate the fruit of their labor to the Lord, the Jews held nothing back—and they were well within their rights! “On that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy” (Nehemiah 12:43). \n\nThe wall had been rebuilt despite external threats and internal fatigue. And chile, if those folks didn’t rejoice! There were choirs and cymbals and harps and singers rocking the house with their jubilant praise. The people sang and offered sacrifices to God with great joy—praise that was heard far and wide.\n\nIt’s a sincere prayer of mine today that I would learn to look on achievements, victories, and answered prayers with that same exuberance. I don’t want to look back on an answered prayer and think, Welp! I’m glad that’s over with! and quickly rush on to other matters. I want to see every triumph for what it is: a victory won by my great and glorious God. I want to take time to honor God by celebrating His works and plans and victories well.\n\nAnd Scripture tells us the Jewish people did just that, rejoicing like wild over a wall. They lifted a resounding praise that neighboring cities could hear because of a wall. To those other cities and nations, rebuilding a wall might have been an insignificant accomplishment, maybe something to jot down in a history book for posterity’s sake, but nothing major. But for the people of God, the rebuilding of the wall meant something. \n\n\u2022 It meant increased protection from enemies who would try to conquer Jerusalem.\n\u2022 It meant that their God hadn’t forsaken them, even though they’d sinned against Him.\n\u2022 It meant that He still dwelt in their holy city and would continue to fight for them.\n\nI’m assuming that, after years in exile, that kind of knowledge was life-giving and joy-fueling for God’s people. I imagine it continued to bring them joy as they remembered it years later. This passage makes me want to do the same, to consider and reconsider God’s hand in my life, to look again and again for His goodness and power at work on my behalf. It also makes me want to learn how to celebrate—really celebrate—those victories, achievements, and even (seemingly) unanswered prayers in such a way that my joy can be heard far and wide.  \n\nBecause if my joy can be seen or heard coming from a mile away, my neighbors and friends will start to wonder, What’s she so happy about? Which may just lead to, How can I have the kind of joy she has? And when asked, I can confidently point them to the great and glorious God who gives me the victory in Him, again and again and again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Nehemiah 13:1-31, John 14:2-3\n\nThe Tower of London was built around the year 1000 AD, and it still stands on the banks of the Thames River today. But a castle that old needs tending to keep looking good, no matter how many famous ravens live there. The regular maintenance is never finished, and every task, once complete, needs to be done again every 75 years. The old castle is never really “finished.” It’s just going through its stages of the 75-year upkeep plan.\n\nWhen Nehemiah returns to Jerusalem, the walls are still standing, but the people have fallen apart. They have forgotten who they are and what God has called them to do. It’s so discouraging after the celebration and commemoration ceremonies in the previous chapters. We all want a happy ending for these people who worked so hard and endured so much.\n\nOn this side of heaven, things will never be perfect. Because of the curse of sin, we will always struggle. But there are three things I think we can learn about the gospel from this passage.\n\nFirst, notice what Nehemiah does before he lets his righteous anger fly. He gathers the whole community and reads the book of Moses. I think it’s safe to say that he read the Pentateuch—at the very least, the Ten Commandments, and at the most, he sat them down for hours and read the whole thing. Either way, before He brings them to justice for breaking God’s law, he reminds them of God’s law. He establishes their common ground. When we are struggling, we must return to God’s Word to remember who we are and to whom we belong.\n\nSecond, remember that Nehemiah is a man of prayer. He prayed before he even answered the king. He is a steady and continuous man of prayer. While he brings judgment to the people, he keeps stopping to pray. He cries out: “Remember me for this, my God, and don’t erase the deeds of faithful love I have done for the house of my God and for its services… look on me with compassion according to the abundance of your faithful love” (Nehemiah 13:14, 22). It’s clear that prayer is an integral part of Nehemiah’s actions. When we find that we are inadequate, when things have gone wrong, we must turn to God in prayer.\n\nFinally, let’s notice that even Nehemiah, the guy who is known for prayer and Scripture reading, couldn’t get it perfectly right. He was a great leader and a true man of God, but he still wasn’t able to create a perfect city. He couldn’t totally stamp out corruption. He couldn’t get people to follow the rules. The people fell into the same sins that sent them into exile in the first place, and Nehemiah couldn’t fix them.\n\nChrist is the only One who can complete the work. He changes hearts, He mends families, and He is making all things new. We are called to read His Word, submit ourselves to prayer, and realize that no matter how dedicated or good we think we are at self-maintenance, we cannot achieve a perfect utopia. We can barely keep the Tower of London from falling down! So we ought to do the work He has called to do, and rest in Christ who is the only One who can truly call a task finished.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy She Reads Truth\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 1:1-22, Psalm 32:7, Daniel 6:8, Daniel 6:13-18\n\nThere’s an old saying that goes, “When God closes a door, He opens a window.” Perhaps you’ve heard it? But God’s work in the lives of His people is far more magnificent than that. \n\nEven better than closing doors and opening windows, what we find in the book of Esther is the active, invisible, and preemptive hand of God at work in the most unexpected places. \n\nToday’s reading sets the stage by casting an ominous shadow over a seemingly happy time of feasting and abundance. The king throws a party meant to last for 180 days, but when he summons his queen so that he might show off her beauty to his guests, she refuses to come to him. This decision has repercussions that will reverberate throughout the kingdom, kicking the rest of the story into motion. \n\nReaders respond in different ways to this conflict between the king and queen. How are we to view her defiance? How should we measure his reaction? But whether we interpret Vashti’s actions as brave or bad, the larger truth of this book remains unchanged. This story is about God and His providential care for His chosen people in exile. In the book of Esther and throughout all of Scripture, God is the main character of every story. \n\nThough His name is not directly mentioned, God’s presence is evident in this Old Testament book. And His sovereignty and goodness are not dependent upon our reactions and interpretations. When faced with an unexpected turn of events or unwelcome challenge, most of us turn to scheming and problem solving, trying to figure things out and then “fix” them as we see fit. But the book of Esther shows us that God does not go around simply reacting to whatever we throw at Him. He doesn’t work that way. No, He acts first. His rescue plans are already in place—even before danger comes our way.  \n\nGod’s involvement in our lives is so much better than closed doors and open windows. In the story of Esther, and in our story of salvation, God designs our deliverance even before man begins to devise our destruction.\n\nThe book of Esther is short, rich, and ultimately points to Christ overcoming death by giving His own life—a ransom for us all. As you read, look for the active, invisible, preemptive hand of God. Consider the ways God has designed your own deliverance, and imagine the invisible ways He is caring for you even now. \n\nGod is good. And He is at work.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 2:1-23, Proverbs 31:10-31\n\nWell, I have to admit; the circumstances of Esther’s appointment as queen are a bit… gritty. \n\nI wish I could say that everything in the book of Esther is beautiful because it’s in the Bible. But the truth is, the Old Testament is filled with the stories of ordinary people who make extraordinarily bad choices. Yes, “All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching” (2 Timothy 3:16), but clearly, we aren’t meant to emulate the idol-loving Jezebel, the jealousy of Joseph’s brothers, or the murderous Cain. \n\nIt’s not Esther I take issue with; it’s her circumstances. I can’t help but read her story and feel a little disturbed by the idea of a young woman kept in a harem. It’s creepy to imagine a king trying out different women until he picks his favorite. And it sure seems like Esther was beloved largely because of her looks (Esther 2:15). I suppose that makes her sound eerily similar to a contestant on some reality television show. It makes for an entertaining show, but it’s surely not showcasing the most life-giving way to date in real life.\n\nSo then, what can we learn from Esther’s appointment as queen?\n\nFirst of all, it is good to remember that God works through imperfect circumstances. I don’t know about you, but that’s a huge relief to me. Contrary to the gospel of social media, we don’t need to have perfect lives for God to move in our lives. Esther was a persecuted orphan girl living in a brothel, but the Lord used her to save His people in a big way. \n\nThe heart of the Father is to bring beauty from ashes (Isaiah 61:3). This is demonstrated in His redeeming work again and again, through the imperfect circumstances of Scripture’s heroes and heroines. Esther is a godly woman who’s called to act in a precarious situation. What you might notice is that Esther took the wise counsel of those she trusted, keeping her ethnicity a secret until the right time as Mordecai advised, and adorning herself as the king’s eunuch instructed. \n\nSure, Esther could have been prideful, determining she ultimately knew best. She could have blurted out her secret and chosen her own fashion statements. But had she gone that route, it might have changed the king’s reaction and the entire story. \n\nSo was Esther passive or humble? Weak or wise?\n\nWhile the circumstances surrounding Esther’s story may raise a few eyebrows in today’s culture, the woman herself seems to be an admirable and fierce role model. Esther knew that “charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting,” but the wisdom found in learning to fear the Lord does not fade (Proverbs 31:30). Out of wisdom and humility, she sought the help she needed. And through that counsel, God gave her the courage to walk into a life-threatening situation on behalf of His people.\n\nEsther trusted in her God and in His perfect will. Through her story, we are reminded that our pasts are never too crooked, our circumstances never too disappointing, to take part in the world-changing work of our heavenly Father.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 3:1-15, Psalm 68:20, Proverbs 16:33\n\nAt times, my life can feel like one of those “Choose Your Own Adventure” books I used to read back in the fourth grade. I find myself at a fork in the road, worrying that if I make the wrong choice the plot will be ruined, the protagonist (i.e. me) won’t be rescued, and my story won’t ever be worth reading. \n\nBut the Bible is a different kind of book. God’s Word is uniquely able to lift my eyes off of the decisions that paralyze me, and instead refocus them on the “author and perfecter” of my story, and of your story, too—of the bigger story that has already been written (Hebrews 12:2). \n\nHere in the book of Esther, the storyline of God’s people takes a desperate turn. Fueled by ego, power, and a desire for revenge, Haman is “filled with fury” (Esther 3:5) and plots the genocide of the Jews. He’d already decided to destroy the Jews, but he waited to show his hand until the “signs”—the casting of lots (v.7)—seemed to confirm that this was more than vindication, that it was a divine assignment. \n\nCasting lots looked much like rolling a pair of dice, and was often used as a way of seeking divine guidance. Joshua cast lots to divide up the promised land among the tribes of Israel (Joshua 18:6). The apostles cast lots to find Judas’s replacement (Acts 1:26). Here, King Ahasuerus’s officials cast lots in his court, and Haman tasks himself with interpreting them. \n\nOn the day Haman chose to move forward, an edict of death was signed and delivered throughout the land, seemingly sealing the doom of God’s people. But their story isn’t determined by a single decision or a lone madman. Our lives are not a Choose Your Own Adventure book where we sink or swim, survive or die, based solely on our ability to make the right choice. \n\nGod’s people would be spared, not because they did everything right and Haman did everything wrong. The edict of death would be repealed, not because Haman didn’t have the power to enforce it—he did—but because there is a stronger hand writing the story. \n\nThere is no rolling the dice with the sovereignty of God. “The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD” (Proverbs 16:33). His plans cannot be thwarted. His story cannot be edited. His people cannot be ripped from His loving hand. \n\nThe story God writes in Esther ultimately points to Jesus. Again, wicked rulers, high on power and poisoned by jealousy, sought to destroy God’s Chosen. Again, the government officials issued decrees that seemed to seal a deal with darkness. Only this time, the edict was not repealed. Christ was killed for our benefit. And once again, the lots were cast: \n\nAnd they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take (Mark 15:24). \n\nGod is sovereign, capable of having His way in our lives and in our history books. While Roman soldiers cast lots to divide up Jesus’ bloody robe, He was already at work making all things new. No man can stop Him. No plot can take Him out. In His sovereignty, He rescued the Jews from Haman’s hatred, just as He rescued us from our sin. Truly, “Our God is a God of salvation” (Psalm 68:20).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 4:1-17, Isaiah 15:1-3, Romans 5:6-11\n\nRachel is a scourge to the devil in Vienna.\n\nEvery time I saw her she was flushed with excitement over a recent chance to share the gospel. Any encounter on the subway, any phone call, and every relationship irresistibly impelled her to tell people the good news. Although she was a gifted linguist with a degree from Cambridge, she carried Bible tracts in her pockets and she wasn’t afraid to use them.\n\nNo amount of poor or sad or weird was enough to keep Rachel from befriending strangers and reaching out to them with hope and love. She was inspiring and a little overwhelming.\n\nOne afternoon, Rachel invited me to a street music event she was staging on Kärntner Straße. She is a classical violinist and had gathered other string musicians to play a concert and share the gospel on that ancient, black stone street.\n\nFeeling both a little shy and peckish, I got a gelato and went antique shopping instead.\n\nI missed an opportunity. God didn’t need me to help share His gospel; His gospel will go forth whether I stand up and speak His name or not. In fact, if I can’t muster a good word about the Lord, Scripture says even the stones will cry out in my place (Luke 19:40).\n\nGod invites us to join His work, not for His sake, but for ours. God invited Esther to join Him in saving the Jewish nation. If Esther had refused to go to the king, God still would have saved His people, but she would have missed an opportunity. As Esther’s cousin Mordecai said: \n\n“If you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jewish people from another place, but you and your father’s family will be destroyed. Who knows, perhaps you have come to your royal position for such a time as this.” –Esther 4:14\n\nOur refusal to take part in God’s work doesn’t thwart God. It limits our privilege to take part in what He is doing. God can even use unrepentant sinners to achieve His good purposes. Consider Pharaoh, Caiaphas the high priest, and Pontius Pilate (Exodus 9:12; John 18:14; John 19:5-16). “But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).\n\nGod’s providence is comprehensive, wise, and holy. His timing and calling are no mistake, and just as He did with Esther, He has placed us here and now, for such a time as this. \n\nWe, like Esther, can have courage, comfort, and peace. From a human perspective, our lives and circumstances can seem totally out of control and scary. But we can rest in God’s providence, knowing that He is working. \n\nLook for God’s invitation to join Him in His work. Have courage, comfort, and peace—you can join Him now! You can always go get a gelato later.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 5:1-14, Proverbs 16:18, Mark 6:14-29\n\nIt was a dinner party with an enviable guest list. Sitting at the head of the table were hosts Michael Eisner, former CEO of Disney, and his wife, Jane. In charge of passing the bread baskets was their friend George Lucas, creator of Star Wars, as well as Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, the guests of honor.\n\nIt was sometime in the ‘80s and there was reason to celebrate. Dick and Jeana had just become the first people to fly around the world without stopping.\n\nAfter the dessert had disappeared from their plates and they’d heard story after story about Dick and Jeana’s worldwide adventure, Jane Eisner raised the question many of us would have asked. “Well, now that you’ve accomplished the pinnacle of your aspirations, what could you possibly do next?”\n\nWithout hesitation, Dick responded, “I’m going to Disneyland!” Without hesitation, Jane responded, “That’s a good slogan.” And so it was.\n\nFrom the 1987 Super Bowl on, the answer to, “You won! What are you going to do now?” became “Disneyland.” And yet, when we watch sports reporters ask this question, it always seems a little silly, doesn’t it? Because after the Gatorade coolers have been thrown, and the trophies have all been shined, the athletes already have exactly what they were after in the first place: victory. What else could a Super Bowl champion possibly need?\n\nIn the books of Esther and Mark, we find two very different women who happen to have their king’s ear—Esther and Herodias’s daughter. Both women are asked a remarkably similar question: “What is it you want? Whatever you want, even if it’s half the kingdom, will be done” (Esther 5:3; Mark 6:23, my paraphrase).\n\nThe similarities between their stories stop there. Overwhelmed with possibility, Herodias’s daughter consults her mother, asking what desires she ought to demand, and they soon decide on their perfect request: John the Baptist’s head. On a platter. Perhaps she believed that for them, the most beneficial and powerful thing that could happen would be the destruction of God’s people. Her choice reeks of pride.\n\nPride comes before destruction, and an arrogant spirit before a fall. –Proverbs 16:18\n\nEsther, on the other hand, asks the king and Haman to attend a banquet where she herself will be the one preparing the platters. This probably seemed like a strange request, even to Esther. But instead of dreaming about the riches that could be hers, she keeps her heart close to the Lord’s. Esther believes the most beneficial and powerful thing that could happen to her is the rescue of her people—of God’s people. Her request is steeped in humility.\n\nEsther lives from a rooted belief in the kingdom that’s already been won for her. She makes choices based on riches she’s already received. Because she trusts in the King on High, she takes joy in making herself low. What else could a beloved daughter of the King possibly need?\n\nMaybe we need to be asking each other new questions as we gather around our own dinner tables. After all, we’ve already been given the kingdom. Now, how will we act? What will we do next?\n\nMay those questions lead us to respond with humility. May they lead us back, again and again, to the heart of the Father.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 6:1-14, Proverbs 26:27, Isaiah 52:1-2\n\nAren’t we all born with a strong sense of justice? From a young age, we tattle on the wrongdoers and we vehemently defend what we call “ours.” We fight for what we believe to be fair. As we grow up, we hopefully mature in our understanding of right and wrong, just and unjust, godly and ungodly. \n\nThis sense of justice is the reason Mordecai’s honoring and Haman’s humbling is so satisfying as we read on in the book of Esther. We want the good guys to win and the bad guys to lose. We tend to like it when people get what is coming to them. As Proverbs 26:27 puts it, “The one who digs a pit, will fall into it.”\n\nIs it a coincidence then, that King Ahasuerus cannot sleep, and so he asks for the daily events to be read to him? No, this event demonstrates God’s sovereignty. In fact, the book of Esther is filled with “coincidences” and fortunate turns of events, making it evident that God is in control and actively working on behalf of His people. During a time of exile and suffering, God rescued His children through an unlikely orphan girl, enacting justice on their behalf. \n\nUnfortunately, the world is still a place of injustice today. We see the bad guys winning. We see evil, hate, death, and disease infecting the world. Life is far from fair for most—something we’ve probably all been told at some point. \n\nWe still cry out when someone wrongs us. We grieve when a devastating attack occurs somewhere in the world. We cannot accept the imperfection and pain of this life. C.S. Lewis said, “If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world.”\n\nWhen our hearts cry out for justice, for good to prevail over evil, our hearts are really crying out for heaven. We long for Christ to come back and make things right once and for all. We long for the new heaven and the new earth (Isaiah 65:17). \n\nIn the stories of Esther, Joseph, Moses, and others, God intervened to save His people because He loved them and He cared about their plight. The greatest demonstration of God’s love was certainly when the Father sent His own perfect Son to die in our place so that justice could be satisfied. We were ransomed because of how much God loves us and loves justice.\n\nWhile we wait for the second coming of the Lord, all is not lost. We have been called to join in the work of kingdom building with Christ even now (1 Corinthians 3:9). Although our final home is not here, we’ve been instructed to pray for God’s will to be done “on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10).\n\nEsther’s story was one of encouragement to the Jewish people in the midst of exile. It was a story to remind them that God is over all and God is good. In a less than perfect world, let Esther be a story of encouragement to all who believe.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 7:1-10, Psalm 91:2-3, Revelation 20:11-15\n\nLately, I have been in a season of waiting. There is a lot of transition and change happening in the coming months, but at the moment, I feel stuck—like I’ve been running full speed, but I’ve had to come to a sudden stop. There’s a huge ravine in front of me, and I’ve reached as far as the current path will take me. I have to wait for a bridge to be built before I can cross to the other side. \n\nBut I don’t want to wait for the bridge. Waiting for the bridge to be built takes too long; it takes away my power. Still, I know with absolute certainty that I cannot build the bridge by myself; I have to wait for the Creator to build it and show me the way. Yet even with the humbling knowledge that I cannot do it on my own, I am impatient. I want the control. \n\nAt this point in her story, Esther had been doing a lot of waiting. She had to wait and see if she would be chosen queen. She had to wait for the king and Haman to come to her banquet, and then she had to wait for her second banquet before asking if the king would save her people. Esther had to wait on God’s timing instead of relying on her own.\n\nIn a book where the name of God is never directly mentioned, God’s providence and all-encompassing power appear time after time. Esther goes before King Ahasuerus, nervous and unsure, but God’s presence went before her, as it does with us (Isaiah 45:2). God continues to be our refuge and our fortress in times of uncertainty and distress (Psalm 91:2). \n\nThough God’s presence was not explicitly stated in this scene with Esther, King Ahasuerus, and Haman, it is evident that He was there. He was there when Esther invited them to the banquet, there when she asked King Ahasuerus to save her people, and He was there in the midst of Esther’s fright and uncertainty. \n\nPerhaps when Esther first heard of Haman’s evil plot, she might have felt as if she were standing at the edge of a ravine. Unsure of where to go next, she simply had to wait for God to build the bridge and show her the way.\n\n And He did. He built the bridge, He led Esther across it, and He worked through Esther to save His people. God took Haman’s disastrous plan and turned it on its head, destroying Haman and restoring full life to the Jews so that they may proclaim His glory throughout the nations.\n\n",

My to-do list gets too long, and instead of just chipping away at it one item at a time, my stomach starts to hurt, my neck gets tight, and I just go back to bed. The rational thing to do is to simply move forward, pay the bills, write the essay I’m avoiding, and buck up. But I find that sometimes I just can’t muscle through. I find that my nose is raw from so much keeping to the grindstone. I can’t move forward for good or for ill. I am paralyzed.\n\nWe can get frozen in place when there’s too much to do, or even when there’s nothing to be done. In either case, panic and flight are the natural human responses to unfavorable circumstances. Both solve nothing, and both betray a lack of faith that God is in control. We find ourselves in that terrifying state of freezing indecision, yet He really only desires one thing: that we turn to Him in trust.\n\nTrust doesn’t mean we have to remain inactive. Often, trust means we must act. In those situations, God calls us to simply do the next right thing, and for the rest, cast our cares on Him (1 Peter 5:7). Do you have a ten-year plan? Good on you. Do you have no plans at all? That’s okay, too; start with the next right thing.\n\nEsther didn’t have a ten-year plan. Her future plans risked her neck, so she had every reason to be paralyzed by fear and indecision. But instead she cries out in agony, “How could I bear to see the disaster that would come on my people?” (Esther 8:6). Even though her enemy Haman had been dealt with, his evil plotting left behind a huge disaster and danger. Lives were at stake. How could her people be saved from destruction? In Esther’s case, King Ahasuerus turned matters over to Esther and Mordecai. \n\nThroughout Esther’s story, we have seen that so much has rested on favor. The favor the king showed Vashti, the favor he showed Esther, the favor the king showed Haman, the favor he showed Mordecai, then the favor he showed the Jews. This favor, of course, is often reversed. The king’s favoring of Vashti ended. Esther favored Haman by inviting him to the feast, but it was to his destruction. Mordecai was ignored, then favored. And finally, the Jews, once despised, were now favored of the king.\n\nAll of this favor is out of our control. Amidst flatteries and reversals, however, God’s favor for His people endures. The story of Esther is ultimately the story of God’s favor toward His people. It’s the story of Psalm 30:11-12: “You turned my lament into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness, so that I can sing to you and not be silent.”\n\nGod’s favor is the greatest surety there can be. We are called to trust Him and walk in obedience. We don’t need to give up and confine ourselves to bed, paralyzed by fear and indecision. We can move forward in confidence of God’s promises. If we trust ourselves to His care, we need not fear or be anxious. Though the whole world heave against us, or when everything is shrouded in darkness, He is King.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Esther 9:1-22, Nehemiah 8:10, Luke 1:46-55\n\nWhen it comes to a blockbuster movie experience, I like to feel a tinge of tension. I don’t mind my emotions being pushed to the brink of disaster before the hero swoops in and saves the day—that is, while I’m sitting in a comfy seat with a jumbo tub of popcorn (extra butter, please). But in real life? Oh no. I’d rather play it safe. \n\nI don’t want to even come close to disaster, disappointment, or despair. I’d prefer to see God’s hand rescue me as soon as the thought that something could go wrong enters my mind. Wouldn’t you?\n\nGod knows this about us, and He knows what we need. His plan is always right on time. Never early. Never late. We see this play out among God’s people in the book of Esther. Haman’s evil edict of death was issued on the thirteenth day of the first month, sending God’s people into a panic (Esther 3:15). But deliverance did not come until the thirteenth day of the twelfth month. The only thing worse than panic is prolonged panic. Am I right? \n\nFor twelve long months God’s people must have pleaded with Him to rescue them. They must have worn paths in the kitchen floor pacing with worry. They must have resisted a million urges to run and hide the little ones they knew Haman had ordered to be killed. They must have fretted that God would not come through, worried they’d misunderstood His plan for them, or felt abandoned by the God who promised to protect them. \n\nDeliverance did not come twelve months early, or twelve weeks early, or twelve days early. \n\nDeliverance came “on the day when the Jews’ enemies had hoped to overpower them, just the opposite happened. The Jews overpowered those who hated them” (Esther 9:1). \n\nThat very day. \n\nThe second they arrived at the juncture they’d been dreading, the switch flipped, the tables turned, and their Great Deliverer delivered them from destruction. God’s people stood, ready to fight, eyeball to eyeball with their worst nightmare. God has promised He will care for us, but we cannot put grace to the side, storing it up for a moment we don’t want to face. \n\nWhen our enemies come for us, God will stand beside us. When our hearts are broken, God will be near (Psalm 34:18). When we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we will see His hand (Psalm 23:4). But we may find ourselves closer to suffering than we’d ever want to be, on our knees praying until they ache. Like Israel did as they fled their Egyptian oppressors (nearly 1,000 years before Esther pleaded for her people to be spared), we may feel the sting of a raging sea before us and hear the pounding of enemy chariots behind us before we are able to see God make a way. \n\nSo what do we do as we wait for our rescue? We stand firm in God’s promises, trusting that He will deliver us at exactly the right moment. We wait for His rescue. We wait on Him. Our God is able to shift our sorrow to gladness and our mourning into celebration (Esther 9:22). He will do it right on time, every time.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThings don’t always go according to plan.\n\nTake the summertime of 1812, for example. Paris was warm and beautiful, and Napoleon’s army was 600,000 men strong. He was on top of the world, but Russia’s Czar Alexander was really starting to get on his nerves. He ignored French trade embargos, and worse, refused to let Napoleon marry one of his sisters. Frustrated but confident, Napoleon made his most ambitious plan yet: take Moscow and show Alexander once and for all who was the greater ruler.\n\nNapoleon crossed from Poland into Russia, his vast army advancing deeper and deeper into the countryside as the Russian forces burned their crops and fled before him. But as he advanced, Napoleon’s supplies and men began to dwindle. And although he did finally limp into Moscow in October, the wind and snow had started to swirl and bite—winter was coming. With only a sixth of his men remaining, Napoleon had to retreat, defeated not by Russia’s military, but by her freezing, obliterating winter.\n\nIf you’ve ever engaged in a land war in Asia, or even parented small children, you know things hardly ever go as planned. So why do we continue to believe we can control our circumstances? History and personal experience prove God alone is in control. The Red Sea parted, Jericho’s walls collapsed, and fire fell on Mt. Carmel—we are not the ones running the show.\n\nHaman planned to crush the Jews (Esther 9:24). He wanted to destroy them. We’ve seen examples of this kind of horrific racism all throughout history. In every era, men have shown this evil instinct to destroy other men for being different. They lay their evil plans, perhaps prevailing for a time, but in the end, their plans fall flat. They may cast the dice, but God alone controls the outcome.\n\nIn our own failed Napoleonic aspirations we are quick to become frustrated, lamenting, “Nothing ever goes like I plan!” But every failed human plan is actually cause for thanksgiving, because all things happen according to the good pleasure of God’s will (Romans 8:28). Likewise, when the enemies of God approach, armed with malice and intent upon blood, we can still give thanks. God Himself is our defense, and we should not fail to celebrate His good providence in all things.\n\nAt the end of the book of Esther, the Jewish people celebrate God’s deliverance. They not only celebrate in the present, but they vow to celebrate in the future—to remember who they are and what God has done:\n\n“These days are remembered and celebrated by every generation, family, province, and city, so that these days of Purim will not lose their significance in Jewish life and their memory will not fade from their descendants.” –Esther 9:28\n\nMay we also remember. May we remember, with Solomon, that “The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps” (Proverbs 16:9). May our hearts respond in thanksgiving because He alone is God, and there is no one like Him (Isaiah 46:9). May we celebrate our freedom in Christ by remembering what we’ve been saved from, and Who has saved us from it.\n\nMake your plans, but rejoice and remember: it is the Lord who had a good plan for us before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4). Glory be to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI’ve always been afraid of the book of Job.\n\nI’m afraid of Job’s story, the way I’m afraid of Abraham’s, and Mary’s, and the disciples’. I’m afraid the cost of following Jesus will be too much for me—unlike Abraham, who obeyed God and prepared his son for sacrifice; and Mary, who was willing to face scandal as an unwed mother; and Jesus’s first disciples, most of whom died as martyrs. I’m afraid that, when faced with the sharp rock of suffering, my faith will shatter like glass. I don’t trust my flesh, which I know will fail. I’m afraid to live fully, to love completely, and trust wholly. I am afraid to suffer.\n\nOf course, I have suffered a variety of wounds, as we all have. If there is a more common thread to humanity than suffering, I’m not sure I know it. And so Job’s story is, naturally, my story. And your story, and your neighbor’s story, and every member of your family’s story, and that person who served you coffee this morning’s story too. In chapter 42, Job’s story ends with the same stunningly beautiful conclusion we are all offered: repentance and restoration.\n\nJob cries out, “I know that you can do anything.… I reject my words and am sorry for them” (Job 42:2,6). He knows that God is just, merciful, and mighty to save. Job doesn’t expect to be made whole, to have everything and everyone he’s lost restored. It is enough for Job to know that God is God and he is not, and to repent of his own pride.\n\nIn chapters 38–41, God speaks. He proclaims His power, His justice, His righteousness, and His sovereignty over all things. It’s a “mic drop” moment, one that needs no punctuation, no follow up. But after Job’s cry of repentance, God responds once more to Job in a manner so kind and lavish that we are compelled to react with just as much awe and wonder as we did when we read that He breathed all creation out of nothing. Yes, God is mighty, unrivaled in power. Yes, God is sovereign, unrivaled in His commitment to justice. But also, Yes, God is good, and He promises us bountiful restoration.\n\nJob received restoration in his lifetime—his fortunes returned, his flocks and herds multiplied, his home filled with new children. Our suffering may not, and often does not, end with restoration in this life. Death wounds us, sickness steals from us, broken relationships limit our ability to trust, and tragedy on a global scale haunts even our happiest days. Our hope is not in the here and now. Ours is a future hope, formed and grounded in God’s Word, molded by His mercy, and secured by His Son.\n\nWe will experience the restoration and renewal of all things, as promised in Revelation 21:3–5. It is the only ending that makes sense to our stories of suffering, the kind and lavish response of a loving Father who promises, one day, to wipe every tear from our eyes.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nIn Night, the seminal autobiographical novel about his experience in Nazi concentration camps, writer Elie Wiesel says this: “Some of the men spoke of God: His mysterious ways, the sins of the Jewish people, and the redemption to come. As for me, I had ceased to pray. I concurred with Job! I was not denying His existence, but I doubted His absolute justice.”\n\nBecause it deeply resonated with his own experiences with tragedy and suffering, Wiesel publicly lectured on the book of Job throughout his career as a professor and Nobel Prize-winning author.\n\nAs I was researching Wiesel’s work on Job, I remembered reading Night in middle school. Then, I had a second thought, one that made my stomach drop and my eyes flood with tears. I realized that one day, my daughter is going to read Night. One day, she is going to find out about the Holocaust. She’ll read about about slavery and Jim Crow and 9/11. She’ll find out about war, famine, genocide, opioid overdoses, and school shootings. One day, she will learn about suffering. And even harder still to imagine, one day, she herself will suffer.\n\nWhere will God be when she learns about these things? And can I trust Him not only with my own suffering, but with my precious baby girl’s?\n\nWhen my heart wavers and falters on the edge of faith, brought on by suffering and fear, I know I cannot stand on my own feelings. I must stand in faith, which is a gift of the Spirit, and I must pray unceasingly for Him to strengthen it. I must stand on the unwavering, infallible Word of God. Here is what it teaches me:\n\n1) God is just and good. He controls the wind and waves, the leviathan and behemoth, and every living creature.\n\n2) His Son Jesus, who is God incarnate, knew suffering here on earth, just as we do. But the suffering He endured was infinitely greater than anything we might bear, as He took on the weight of the world’s sins.\n\nSuffering belongs to all of us, through all time. One of the gifts that comes with reading Job through the lens of the New Testament is knowing that his story of suffering is our story and that Jesus came to secure true righteousness for all who believe in Him.\n\nGod’s justice is absolute. In the depths of suffering, it is no wonder we question it. God speaks to Job, “Would you really challenge my justice? Would you declare me guilty to justify yourself?” (Job 40:8). Would we?\n\nWe can trust God with our suffering because He is the Creator and King of everything. But we can also trust God with our suffering because Jesus suffered, bearing all of our sorrows to the cross.\n\nHe himself bore our sicknesses,\nand he carried our pains;\nbut we in turn regarded him stricken,\nstruck down by God, and afflicted.\nBut he was pierced because of our rebellion,\ncrushed because of our iniquities;\npunishment for our peace was on him,\nand we are healed by his wounds (Isaiah 53:4–5).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nA few days a week, our notoriously chaotic and tardy household experiences a mini miracle. Somehow, we make it downstairs in time to eat breakfast, and inevitably, my four-year-old daughter asks to listen to her favorite catechism songs. And before I’ve had one sip of coffee, it starts: kid voices, electronic synth background music, and “GOD IS THE CRE-A-TOR OF EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING!” Then it repeats, and repeats again, and even in my pre-caffeinated state, I’m aware and grateful that this will be the song my girl has stuck in her head all day.\n\n“What is God?” The answer to this question, in some form or fashion, is foundational to every Church creed. It’s also touched upon in the very first sentence of Scripture. Everything started from God, who has no beginning and no end. And implicit in the story of creation is the sheer goodness, creativity, and affection of our Maker.\n\nThis is the truth God thunders from the whirlwind when He appears to the long-suffering Job. His speech in chapters 38 and 39 hearkens back to the story of creation in Genesis chapter 1: God created the earth and sea, the light and dark, the weather, the stars, and the animals (Job 38:4–39:30).\n\nGod presents two challenges to Job during His speech, and these two chapters contain the first. God is essentially asking, Do you understand how all this was made? How it all works? He is challenging Job’s finite understanding with all these questions. He’s challenging Job’s focus on himself.\n\nGod is not finished with His speech, but the start of it is more than enough for Job to fall back into his place. He has been reminded of Who he is speaking to, and just what the Maker of heaven and earth is capable of doing. And we, like Job, can marvel at His majesty and find our provision in His mercy.\n\nThe Heidelberg Catechism, written in 1563, poses this question and answer about the first line of the Apostles” Creed:\n\nQuestion: What do you believe when you say,“I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth”?\n\nAnswer: That the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who out of nothing created heaven and earth and everything in them, who still upholds and rules them by his eternal counsel and providence, is my God and Father because of Christ the Son. I trust God so much that I do not doubt he will provide whatever I need for body and soul, and will turn to my good whatever adversity he sends upon me in this sad world. God is able to do this because he is almighty God and desires to do this because he is a faithful Father.\n\nGod is almighty and faithful, full of mercy and majesty, creativity and care. As He declares His infinite holiness in these chapters, He does so to one man, Job. But God’s message is an eternal, cosmic truth, an invitation for each of us to rest in the security of knowing that we, too, are intimately loved by our Creator.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nToday’s readings are about mercy and majesty, two perfect descriptors of our perfect God. He is indeed merciful, and He is the King. But toward the end of this book about suffering, these two truths stand on trial. God has yet to show mercy to Job. If He is King, and sovereign, and has dominion over everything, why has His faithful servant suffered so much?\n\nLike God Himself, weather is unpredictable, wild, and powerful. So when Elihu describes the power of God, he talks about the weather. “He says to the snow, ‘fall to the earth,’” and “Ice is formed by the breath of God,” and “He saturates clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.” The wild, untamable weather that, despite our most advanced radar and predictions, never does what we think it will—this weather is controlled by God, a testament to His sovereignty and majesty.\n\nI write this while most of the United States is gripped by deadly freezing temperatures, the lowest in a generation. I write this after seeing our local weather-people get utterly destroyed on Twitter because they missed a forecast for snow. And always, their defense is simply this: weather is WEATHER. It is, by its very nature, impossible to control. We can read the radar, the charts, the signs, but at the end of the day, weather does what weather wants. Or rather, weather does what God wants.\n\nBut God’s majesty does have boundaries, lines drawn by His character and His goodness. In 37:13 we read, “He causes this to happen for punishment, for his land, or for his faithful love” (emphasis added). In verse 23, we are told, “The Almighty—we cannot reach him—he is exalted in power! He will not violate justice and abundant righteousness.” God may be utterly other, higher than anything we can fathom, but He has bound Himself by His character. And His character, proclaimed by Elihu and written throughout the Scriptures, is steadfast and faithful love, justice, and abundant righteousness.\n\nThe answer to the question, Can we trust God in our suffering? is yes, because of His abundant righteousness. Yes, because of His perfect will and His unbreakable commitment to His people, to us.\n\nThe psalmist wrote:\n\nI wait for the LORD; I wait\nand put my hope in his word.\nI wait for the Lord\nmore than watchmen for the morning—\nmore than watchmen for the morning.\nIsrael, put your hope in the Lord.\nFor there is faithful love with the LORD,\nand with him is redemption in abundance (Psalm 130:5–7).\n\nWe can wait, and we can hope, even in the deepest suffering, because there is faithful love and redemption in abundance in the arms of our good Father.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nWhen I was a child in Sunday School, someone once told me that God answers our prayers in three ways: with a “yes,” a “no,” or a “not yet.” To be clear, I don’t think God’s answers are nearly as neat and tidy as that. His ways are mysterious, far bigger and more cosmic than we could ever perceive. As I look back on that teaching now, I wonder, What about when He just doesn’t answer? or What if His “answer” comes as painful, intense, soul-crushing silence? As for Job, he begins to wonder if God even hears him: “If only I had someone to hear my case! Here is my signature; let the Almighty answer me” (Job 31:35). But Job is not the only figure in Scripture who felt the absence of God.\n\nIn John 11, Jesus delays going to heal His friend Lazarus, who then dies. In response, his sister Martha tells Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died” (v.21). Martha had sent for Jesus, and His delay was silence in her ears.\n\nIn Psalm 13, David cries out, “How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?” (v.1). But in Psalm 55, David speaks with confidence that God really does hear him, even when he feels alone: “I complain and groan morning, noon, and night, and he hears my voice” (v.17).\n\nIn these chapters from Job, the young counselor Elihu is responding to Job’s cry for God to answer. He challenges Job’s pride, suggesting that God’s silence is in response to Job’s pride-filled assertions that he is righteous and does not deserve his situation. Elihu isn’t exactly compassionate toward Job, but he does speak some important truths about God.\n\nSometimes God is silent. Sometimes He speaks. But He is always just, the standard of all that is good and holy and right. He is the Almighty, the all-knowing, the only Author and Creator and Sustainer of our faith. As Elihu says, “It is impossible for God to do wrong, and for the Almighty to act unjustly” (Job 34:10).\n\nReading through the book of Job, this question has come to me again and again: Do you trust Him—even when He seems silent? My honest answer is that I try, but most of the time I fail.\n\nI see myself in Job, as he protests, “But I did everything right!”\n\nI see myself in Martha, blaming Jesus for not doing exactly what she wanted Him to do.\n\nI see myself in David, crushed by sin and desperate to see the Lord.\n\nIn all things—even His silence—do I trust that He still holds all things together? After all, He is God, and I am not. Therefore, “when God is silent, who can declare him guilty?” (Psalm 55:17). He does not answer to us.\n\nSo do I trust the One who spun out the stars, who exhaled Creation and all its glory? Do I trust the One who was born into the dark and cold, who wept blood in Gethsemane, who died a brutal death for me? My only response to His love is to offer mine in return, despite what I see or understand. I believe that one day, I’ll stand before my God in perfect peace, and all the fear and unbelief will be gone. Until then, His Word tells me that He is worthy of my hope and trust. He hears my cries and is not indifferent to my suffering, even when He seems silent.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nI recently had a conversation with a friend who is facing a trial at work. A co-worker spread a false rumor about her, and now my friend must defend herself and her character to her boss. We talked about how lonely and powerless the business of defending oneself can be.\n\nAt this point in Job’s trial, prosecutors Bildad and Eliphaz are winning. Although they have no evidence, they have made a strong case that Job has sinned and earned the punishment he is now suffering. Job has done his best to be his own defense attorney, defending his character to his prosecutors as well as to God. But his case is weak in the face of his dire circumstances, and the verdict seems to be leaning one way: Job has done something to deserve this punishment.\n\nEnter Elihu. Young in years but wise in spirit, Elihu pauses the impending verdict and suggests another way: “If there is an angel on his side…to be gracious and say, ‘Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom’” (Job 33:24–25).\n\nAfter reading those words, I breathed a sigh of relief. Finally someone is suggesting that Job doesn’t have to do anything to get himself out of this situation. He doesn’t have to plead with God or somehow correct the unrighteous behavior we still have no proof of. There is a third way in the form of ransom.\n\nElihu speaks of a gracious and loving God in these chapters, one who is willing to forgive, keep us from death, and ultimately restore us to righteousness (v.26). This is the God I have come to know through Jesus Christ, who is more than an angel—He is my Savior.\n\nWhereas both Job and my friend were innocent, the case brought against me is true. I have done wrong. I have sinned. There is no defense I could muster against that prosecution. Yet, by the blood of Christ, I have received the same ransom Elihu suggests here. Jesus is my defender so that I don’t have to defend myself.\n\nBecause of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ, Elihu’s hypothetical scenario is our everyday reality. We have a defender. We have a good Judge who has restored us to righteousness. Because of this, we walk in grace, not judgment. And we step forward without fear, knowing that when we one day see His face, it will be “with a shout of joy” (v.26).\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nAs if Job’s suffering isn’t enough, he must now endure the scorn of onlookers, men who spit on him and openly despise him, simply for the suffering that’s befallen him. Worse, these onlookers were once far beneath Job on the social, economic, and moral ladder (Job 30:1). Now, they’re mocking him. Job falls into a unique type of despair caused when you are suffering but those around you are not.\n\nNo one was literally spitting on me, but I have certainly experienced scorn for my suffering from those around me. I experience it most on social media. Whenever I see a friend post about something she has that I don’t, but wish I did, I feel the scorn. A husband, a child, another book coming out—posts about these things can strike a sensitive nerve in me, a place that quietly suffers from loneliness, longing, and lack. Because of this, a simple engagement announcement, wedding photo, or book-cover reveal can feel like torture to my heart.\n\nUnlike the wicked men in our reading today, this mocking is completely unintentional on the part of my friends, but it still has the power to deepen my despair, not only because comparison is the thief of joy, but because the voice of the mockers convinces me that I am alone in my suffering. Everyone else’s life seems to be moving along according to plan. Mine is not.\n\nI wonder if Satan sent the mockers to Job, and I wonder if he did so knowing how frail we humans are in the face of loneliness. Suffering is difficult. Suffering alone is unbearable.\n\nPerhaps this would be Job’s tipping point. I would have understood if it was, but Job still cries out to God. It is a despairing cry, but a cry nonetheless: “I cry out to you for help, but You do not answer me” (Job 30:20). His words foreshadow the ultimate cry of despair when Christ hangs on a cross and asks, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” (Matthew 27:46).\n\nChrist suffered. Christ was mocked in that suffering. Christ felt forsaken by God. All of Christ’s work and ministry led to those hours of scorn on the cross. And yet, I continue to sit in my suffering, I look at the thriving lives of those around me, and I convince myself I am alone when the exact opposite is true.\n\nThis is why the companionship of Christ and the knowledge of His suffering are so important to hold onto in our darkest times. If we do not listen first to these truths, we will only hear the voices of the mockers telling us we are alone.\n\nBut you are not. We are not. Not in this. Not ever. Jesus has cried out on our behalf, and because of Him, we are not forsaken, not abandoned, and never forgotten in our suffering.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nI have a new addiction, and it’s called YouTube. A couple of weeks ago, my doctor prescribed a new diet for me. I got on YouTube to see if anyone had tried it and had any meal ideas. Approximately two-hundred million people have and they do. I watched approximately two-hundred million of their videos. Each day I visit again, hoping to learn more.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with looking up a recipe on YouTube, but when forty-five minutes have passed, and I’m still watching people talk about “What I Eat in a Day” or “How I Grocery Shop,” it could be that I am looking for more than a simple recipe. Like the gold and silver miners Job describes, I am probing the “dark recesses” for something valuable.\n\nIn today’s reading, Job describes the difficulty of finding and attaining wisdom. According to him, wisdom is invaluable, almost impossible to find, and only known to God (Job 28:20,13,23).\n\nThe way to wisdom. That is the ultimate aim of my search. To know what is good, right, and wise. And yet, I am looking for it in the wrong place. I am mining for gold, not wisdom.\n\nDo you know what happens after I spend forty-five minutes watching videos of chefs and health gurus? I don’t actually get more knowledgeable. I get more confused. With so many different opinions about what to eat and when, I don’t know whose voice to heed.\n\nJob’s quest for wisdom does not lead him to a certain location or web address. It leads him to Almighty God: “The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom. And to turn from evil is understanding” (Job 28:28).\n\nThough the internet will convince us otherwise, as Christ-followers, we have access to this wisdom and understanding. As Paul told the church in Corinth, “But it is from Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became God-given wisdom for us” (1 Corinthians 1:30).\n\nChrist is the physical manifestation of God-given wisdom, and with our knowledge of the Word and by the power of the Holy Spirit, we have access to this wisdom. The Gospels tell us how Jesus ministered, prayed, made decisions, and treated others. The Holy Spirit indwells us so that we can discern how to use Christ-like wisdom in our everyday lives.\n\nGod-given wisdom does not leave us confused. It does not make us question whose voice to heed or what to do. God-given wisdom is clear. It is written in the Word, and it has been written on our hearts. This is why forty-five minutes spent reading the Gospels does not create the same angst and confusion as forty-five minutes spent online.\n\nAs we venture out on our quests for wisdom, let us seek true, God-given wisdom. Let us turn first to the life of Christ. For if He is in you, so is wisdom.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nMy experience in the Christian life often feels like being on a train that’s traveling through the mountains. One minute the view out my window is crisp and clear. I am certain of how to do right in the eyes of God. But the next minute, I am in a tunnel, and the once-clear view goes dark. Life gets complicated, and I am not sure how to navigate it in a righteous way. In these times, I have often asked the questions that Bildad did: “How can a person be justified before God? How can one born of woman be pure?” (Job 25:4–5).\n\nInstead of directly answering Bildad’s question, Job replies with a list of acts that exemplify God’s power: “By His power He stirred the sea… By His breath the heavens gained their beauty” (Job 26:12–13). Similar to our reading from yesterday, it seems that Job is asking a better question now. Instead of how—How can man be righteous?—he asks who—Who is God? These questions might seem unrelated, but one must be asked before the other can be answered.\n\nA few years ago, during a tunnel season of intense anxiety, I felt like I could not see up from down. I wasn’t sure what I was doing right and what I was doing wrong. Thinking and analyzing my way through things wasn’t working; it simply increased my anxiety. Finally, I turned to what I knew. Each morning, I wrote down five things I knew to be true about God, even if I only believed it that day. I scrawled truths like, He is fighting for me. He is my Creator. And eventually I began to write, He is good.\n\nThis was not a quick fix for my anxiety, but it helped me weather the season until I came out the other side, and it taught me that when it comes to our own righteousness, the question is not how but who. When I am asking what to do, what is right, I need a friend to tell me, as Job told Bildad, “I will teach you about God’s power” (Job 27:11).\n\nThis is where our rightness begins, with a God who loves us, and in that love sent His Son to make us righteous. If we stand any chance of doing good on this earth, our actions must be motivated and sustained by that love—the love of Christ and of the Father who sent Him. It is the who that makes us good, not the how. And while the how may change as we grow and learn in faith, the who never does. The truth of Christ remains the same.\n\nMay we rest in God’s goodness today and let go of the quest for our own. For in the end it is all by His power; it is all by His breath.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nIn Eliphaz’s third and final speech, he accuses Job of wickedness. Grasping for a reason behind his friend’s suffering, Eliphaz must believe his friend has done something to deserve this. If he hadn’t, surely God would not have allowed this amount of suffering to befall him.\n\nHow quickly our faith reduces to a formula when in crisis. If I do good works for God, God will bless me, right? Job knew that no matter what he did or did not do, God “is unchangeable, who can oppose Him? He does what he desires” (Job 23:13). Which leaves us wondering, if the outcome will always be the same, why even bother with trying to do good?\n\nI recently moved into a house with a newly remodeled kitchen. It is neat and pristine on the surface, but I have learned that the pipes beneath it are not. Previous owners committed the cardinal sin against sinks. They put grease down the drain, and now I’m dealing with a clog.\n\nAs several different plumbers have come in and out of my home, I have learned that a beautiful kitchen is worthless if the pipes are bad. When it comes to kitchens, it is only what’s beneath the surface that allows everything to function, flow, and thrive. When it comes to us, it is the same.\n\nTo the church in Galatia, Paul wrote, “For whatever a person sows he will also reap, because the one who sows to his flesh will reap destruction from the flesh” (Galatians 6:7–8). For whatever a man puts down the drain, he will also see it come up again.\n\nGod cares about our good works, not because they affect His will—He is unchangeable, who can oppose Him?—but because they affect who we are. As Paul continues, saying, “the one who sows to his flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit” (v.8).\n\nWe must not get tired of doing good, not because our good deeds will lead to good circumstances, but because sowing goodness leads to a life of trusting in the Spirit—the type of life that can withstand trials with faith.\n\nJob seems to have the opposite problem of my kitchen. His life is in shambles, his kitchen a disaster zone, but the plumbing is clear. He is asking why, as we all would, but he is also asking a better question: where? Where is God in the struggle? “If only I knew how to find him,” he pleads, “so that I could go to His throne” (Job 23:3).\n\nThrough our great High Priest Jesus Christ, we have direct access to the throne room Job seeks. Because of this, although we can’t always be confident of the why, we can be confident of the where. Where is God in our suffering? Right there with us in the midst of it.\n\nWhatever suffering befalls you today, know that God is near. And His Spirit is allowing you to do good, so that even if your physical life is in shambles, you can be confident the life inside of you is eternal. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\n“Why do bad things happen to good people?”\n\nThis is a question we’ve all asked at some point in our lives. And up until this point in our reading of Job, it’s been the essential question. In other words, how else could Job’s excruciating circumstances be explained here, “on the ground”? (Job 1:20). No one sitting around Job had access to the heavenly scene you and I read in chapters 1 and 2, so how else were they to understand the human wreckage sitting right in front of them? As far as Job’s friends were concerned, the only possibly explanation was that Job must have committed some egregious sin.\n\nJob and his friends did have the same fundamental theological framework. With this in mind, they reasoned that if people are good, they can expect God to be good to them in return. (This also sounds an awful lot like a message from today’s culture.) Sinful behavior, on the other hand, results in disastrous consequences. (We see this laced throughout God’s instructions at Sinai, emphasized by the prophets, and threaded throughout later books as well.) But this a human expectation. We believe life is supposed to be fair. Turns out, it’s not—which is why we hear the steady drumbeat of this question throughout Job: “Why do bad things happen to good people?”\n\nIn this chapter, that question gets turned somewhat on its head, inverted: “Why do good things keep happening to bad people?” Why are some wealthy and seemingly untroubled while others struggle day in and day out? In our cultural terms, we wonder how someone can afford to travel abroad to exotic places while others have to work three jobs, struggling to keep food on the table. Why do some people seem to lead such peaceful lives? How do some get away with blatantly rejecting God? None of it seems fair.\n\nZophar’s emphatic response was this: the sinful may lead lives that look just peachy on the outside, but it’s all fleeting (ch. 20). Those who mistreat the poor and greedily hoard everything in sight—in the end, they will be crushed under God’s judgment and end up in the terror of utter darkness. Job’s response to this? Basically, “Yeah, right.” From what he had seen, the lives of immoral people were often golden. Their families were fine, they lived in security, and they were prosperous.\n\nLetting the wicked get off scot free is not justice, Job reasoned. Most of us would agree with him, I suspect, as we watch all kinds of contemporary injustices parade across our television screens daily. But Job’s observations—while spot-on, to be sure—are not the only perspective. Scripture gives us another view, another way to regard the wicked who seem to flourish in this world. As the psalmist declared, it is only for a season. Those who wait on the Lord, those who hope in Him, will see justice (Psalm 37:34–36). And it is in the waiting that we, like Job, must trust in God and His righteous character, rather than trusting in what we perceive with our own eyes.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Bildad’s Second Speech and Job’s Reply",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nIn the wake of Bildad’s second speech (Job 18)—a terrifying description of the darkness, entrapment, and utter destruction awaiting the wicked—Job lamented. He returned his focus once again to how God had destroyed him in every way. He mourned his lost hope and the feeling of being trapped in his circumstances (Job 19:10,12). He lamented that he was a physical wreck and that all of his household—relatives, guests, servants, and even his own wife—now despised him (vv.13–19,20).\n\nIn other words, Job’s extreme suffering continued. But now it was interlaced with crushing social abandonment. Nevertheless, what Job said next stands as a radical alternative to despair:\n\n“But I know that my Redeemer lives” (v.25).\n\nA “redeemer” was a family member who bought back persons or property that had been lost to the family due to poverty. We know the practice well from the selfless action of Boaz, when he redeemed the property of Naomi’s family and married the widowed Ruth. We know of the redemption and deliverance of God’s people Israel from their enslavement in Egypt. And we remember how Isaiah repeatedly called the Lord “God of Israel,” “the Redeemer,” and “the Holy One of Israel.”\n\nJob’s own declaration about God is woven within this same rich tapestry of faith. Having just said that his own relatives, or “kin,” had completely deserted him, Job fully affirmed that his “kinsman-redeemer,” his God, would not fail to rise up to vindicate and buy him back. “But I know” tells us something about Job’s confidence in God—so much so, that he asked that his words be inscribed as a witness for the future (vv.23–24)—and so they were!\n\nJob’s profound vow of hope continues on as he proclaims that he will see his Redeemer:\n\n“Even after my skin has been destroyed,\nyet I will see God in my flesh.\nI will see him myself;\nmy eyes will look at him, and not as a stranger.\nMy heart longs within me (vv.26–27).”\n\nPerhaps he was echoing the symbolism of dust from Genesis 3, or maybe he anticipated restoration from his present illness (2:8;7:5). Regardless, his words are telling: he knew God would remain faithful. The bottom line is this: Job affirmed that he would see God. He was clinging to the truth that he knew. Seeing his Redeemer was what Job wanted more than anything else, and indeed he did, as we will read later in the book (ch. 38–41).\n\nThe beauty of this beloved passage lies in a paradox. On one hand, we see the ambiguity of never really knowing how or when our pain, suffering, and weariness will end. But on the other, we see Job’s fierce, unwavering hope. Hope compelled him forward, re-anchoring and recentering him to his faith. May we learn to do the same. Let us trust in the name of the Lord, relying on Him alone (Isaiah 50:10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nHow many times has some very well-meaning person tried to assuage your heartache with words, saying something along the lines of this: “God will comfort you and see you through this. He always does.” Or this: “Just hang in there. Evil people always get what they deserve.”\n\nLook closely, and you’ll see those two sentiments are basically parts of Eliphaz’s second conversation with Job. So why are they a problem? Well, for one thing, the latter suggests that Job must be evil too—why else would he be suffering badly? Their conversation leads to the question: How do we truly weep with, mourn with, and comfort those who are broken? How do we become true comforters? (Romans 12:15).\n\nFirst, we need to read and truly absorb Job’s scorching honesty in chapters 16 and 17, where the stakes are even higher. Just a reminder: God refused to allow Satan to take Job’s life, which means Job’s torment was as bad as it could possibly get with no relief anywhere, falling just short of death—and Job couldn’t exactly turn to morphine to numb the pain. So now the question becomes one of self-reflection: If we are the ones in the fiery furnace, how do we cling to our relationship with God when it feels as if it is all going up in smoke?\n\nThese two questions are tied together, because those who weep and mourn most effectively will have climbed into that fiery furnace of suffering in some way. In doing so, they join the “Jobs” of the world. So for both situations, we wonder:\n\n\u2022 What does true faithfulness look like, both for the one who comforts and the one who suffers? n\u2022 What part does prayer play in our suffering? n\u2022 What does it mean to bring all our emotions—even our anger, doubt, and feelings of betrayal—before God?\n\nAfter all, Job’s protests were laced with accusations. If his suffering teaches us anything, it is to strip away all pretenses—physical and spiritual. God had worn out and torn up Job, seized him by the neck and dashed him to pieces to the point that Job’s face was red from weeping (Job 16:7–9,12,16). His dark anger boiled over in agonizing questions, as he protested the stony silence of God.\n\nStill, more than anything else, Job longed for his shattered relationship with God to be mended. He’d already sought out a mediator to bring them together (9:33–35; 16:21). He also repeatedly begged to talk with God—which he ultimately did in the most extraordinary of circumstances. Most importantly, Job returned to this understanding: his “advocate” and “witness” were set apart on high (16:19). Job remembered who he was and who he was not—he was not God. All of this points to Job’s faithfulness and his very real relationship with God.\n\nSo how do we sit with someone in their despair? How do we pray in the midst of others’ suffering, as well as our own? In my own experience, words like “Lord have mercy! Christ have Mercy!” bring me back to the truth of God’s character, of both His unfailing lovingkindness and ultimate sovereignty through Jesus Christ. Our Savior reaches through our blinding pain to comfort and deliver us. Our prayer for mercy, offered with humility and hope, binds us together before the God who comforts, even from on high.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nWhere does Job’s hope lie, and where does our own?\n\nPause for a moment to reflect back on one of your darkest times. Perhaps you tossed and turned for sleepless nights, futilely attempting to unravel the tangled web created by bad decisions. Perhaps you agonized over a bitter and angry child. Perhaps physical pain incessantly pierced and jabbed at you. Perhaps… Perhaps. No matter what our individual calamities, each one of us has been (or will someday be) there with Job, drained of strength and courage to face even the next hour. Where can we turn? Where can we place our hope? And how?\n\nWe may have to venture outside Job chapters 13 and 14 to knit together those slender strands that constitute hope, especially in the midst of the unrelenting pain that chews away at every part of our lives. At this point in his terrible journey, Job contrasted human hope (quite unfavorably) to a chopped down tree. Even though the tree had been destroyed, it sprouted again when watered—not so, with those who sleep in death (14:7–12). With great courage, Job had previously declared that he was prepared to defend himself before God, knowing full well that no godless person could stand in His presence (13:15–16). But like most of our courageous statements, Job’s expectations faded almost as quickly as he spoke them. He was back in the gloom of his torment and suffering. For Job, the steady and irreversible disintegration of mountains and rock in the natural world were a fitting metaphor for the erosion of his hope (14:18–19).\n\nOf course, that is not the end of Job’s story—or ours. We affirm with saints through the ages that our faithful God does restore our lives and comfort us in our pain (Psalm 71:20–21). We believe we will be carried through the deep waters and the ravaging fire (Isaiah 43:1–2). We hold fast to the hope that Jesus is the resurrection and the life (John 11:25–26). And we believe God has the power to do all He’s promised to do (Romans 4:20–24). This means that if we are in Christ Jesus, we have crossed over from death to life—even now! (John 5:24–25). Did you catch that? It’s a truth worth repeating, this time with the apostle Paul’s words, who tells us that right now, this very moment, we are seated in the heavenly realms with Jesus (Ephesians 2:6).\n\nHow do we respond? I confess I’m tempted to be a bit skeptical from time to time. You too? Thankfully, there is another path on which to set out at this point. Even from the crucible of our suffering and discouragement, we can take up the mantle of the psalmist. We have the privilege of declaring God’s goodness, of proclaiming the richness of God’s immeasurable and precious grace, and of being increasingly thankful (Psalm 71:14–18). Gratitude trumps grumpiness—every time, in all circumstances. The Apostle Paul affirmed that as well, saying, “Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus” (1 Thessalonians 5:18).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nHere’s a question: Can anything good come out of the mouths of Job’s friends? I don’t know about you, but I occasionally find myself thinking (dismissively), “Yes, but one of Job’s friends said that.” The subtext is that we can safely skim over what they said and then move on. The three friends, however, had some extraordinarily good theology; it just happens to have been misapplied.\n\nThe three “friends,” “comforters,” or whatever we label those well-meaning fellows, arrived from afar in order to weep, mourn, and sit silently with Job. Their intentions were noble—until they started to speak! After they sat silently with Job for a whole week, Job set them back on their heels with a deeply troubling lament. In response, the first two friends tried to cajole Job into confession and repentance, but he would have none of it. His response was to ask why God was so cruelly oppressing him, which had left him longing for the darkness of the grave.\n\nWhat do we say in response to that kind of raw pain? When we find ourselves in such circumstances, we stumble about, trying to be “meaningful” in our comforting. Toward that same end, Zophar ventured in, declaring that God is utterly transcendent and all-powerful beyond the highest heaven and the depths of the grave. This is true, but a gnawing question remains: how can we really wrap our minds (and hearts) around this majestic, sovereign transcendence of God? And then how do we talk about it, especially when we are face to face with seemingly interminable agony? How can we assure suffering friends that our God is both exalted far above all earthly powers and, at the same time, relentlessly and intimately loving? What comfort lies in that combination?\n\nZophar’s next words head down the path we so often take. Having professed the mystery of God’s ways, Zophar proceeded to speak for God, promising an array of hopeful results—if Job would just confess his sins!\n\nIt is no wonder Job was unimpressed. At the same time, he picked up on the most important part of what Zophar said and fleshed out his own perspective on it. Job indeed knew that nothing in God’s universe was outside God’s control, but he had come to know the dark side of that—devastation of land, degradation of the rich and powerful, whole nations destroyed and dispersed. The upshot for Job was that God was responsible for his suffering in that He allowed it. This is bold honesty. And that is where we need to be, frightening as it might actually be to say (and hear) these things. But we must remember that in the end, God affirmed what Job had said (Job 42:7–8). May that be a profound encouragement to us as we wrestle with how to express the truth of suffering.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nOne of my kids got into trouble last week, and it was that kind of interesting trouble all the other kids love to talk about. Juicy trouble is everyone’s favorite kind of trouble. So his siblings talked, and he was furious at the humiliating injustice of being talked about. I overheard my husband trying to explain to him that if he had acted justly in the first place, the others would have nothing to say.\n\nMy little fella isn’t alone. We are all inclined to think that we are right and everyone else is wrong. We like our own version of justice. We are quick to condemn the faults of others and justify ourselves. But we cannot be our own standard of justice, because we are finite and fallen.\n\nThis is why it’s hard to understand the book of Job. Bildad’s perspective is more familiar than Job’s, because like Bildad, we redefine righteousness to suit our own ends and try to treat justice like karma. Want to know who has sinned? Look and see how they “got what was coming to them.” But justice isn’t karma. It’s a mistake to assume that when something good happens to us, it is because we’ve been good. When we hum along with The Sound of Music’s Fraulein Maria, saying, “Nothing comes from nothing… I must have done something good,” we are singing the same tune as Bildad.\n\nInstead of basing our outcomes on our actions, Job points out two things. First, justice is God’s, not ours: “Even if I were in the right, I could not answer. I could only beg my Judge for mercy” (Job 9:15). God is the righteous one. When He acts, no one can condemn Him. No one can contend with Him. This is uncomfortable, because we like justice to be defined our way.\n\nSecond, God is sovereign. Whether things go right or seemingly wrong for us, God is still in control. Nothing happens outside of His will. “If it isn’t he, then who is it?” Job asks rhetorically (v.24). We’ve already glimpsed into the heavens at the beginning of Job, where God gives Satan permission to torment a righteous man. God’s sovereignty is uncomfortable, especially when the wicked seem to succeed and the righteous suffer.\n\nSo we struggle with questions like these: “Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?” (8:3). The clear answer is a resounding “No!” God’s thoughts are higher than ours, and His ways higher than ours, and we cannot answer or contend with Him (Isaiah 55:8–9).\n\nLike Job, we want to know why God allows bad things to happen (Job 10:18). But there are a lot of things we don’t get to know in this life. It shouldn’t surprise us that we cannot fully comprehend the Almighty, that He doesn’t bow to our will. But there is good news: God is good, and we are safe in His care (v.12). We need not fear. When we, like children, don’t see the whole picture, we can still trust that God’s justice is good because He is good, and He cares for us.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nOne of my favorite lecture series from my first seminary experience (I’ve recently begun a second seminary adventure at the “mature” age of 55!) was about having a “high view” of God. We had lively discussions in class regarding how, in our modern era’s quest to make the gospel relevant, we’ve all but lost the kind of deep reverence prophets like Isaiah and psalmists like David displayed toward God. In our bumper-sticker theology, “God is my copilot” culture, we’ve unwittingly minimized the omniscience and omnipotence of the Alpha and Omega in an attempt to make Him more accessible.\n\nI remember being so convicted during those classes, realizing I didn’t revere God the way I should. I committed to being more circumspect in how I addressed Him in prayer and even how I carried His Word, holding my Bible as a precious treasure instead of carelessly shoving it into a suitcase or tossing it into the back seat of the car. I still hold to those convictions.\n\nHowever, as I look back over my walk of faith in the 20-plus years since that class, it’s clear I’ve often overcorrected, swinging into the opposite side of the doctrinal ditch. I didn’t always have the spiritual maturity to understand that having a high view of God doesn’t mean we need to have a degrading view of ourselves. Of course, humans are wicked and depraved apart from divine grace, but after we put our faith and hope in Jesus Christ, we’re allowed to shrug into His robes of righteousness, knowing we have been adopted into the family of God as full heirs! (Romans 8:14–17). A high view of God should open believers’ hearts and minds to what our heavenly Father says about us, His beloved children.\n\nNow, if we give Job’s three friends a big benefit of doubt, we can assume they had mostly good intentions when they delivered their self-righteous lectures. However, like a young seminarian armed with more head knowledge than spiritual maturity, their arrows missed the mark by a country mile!\n\nJob understands the situation well. He says, “What strength do I have, that I should continue to hope? What is my future, that I should be patient?… Since I cannot help myself, the hope for success has been banished from me” (6:11,13). Job cannot change his bleak situation, despite his innocence.\n\nBut that’s the point. Job’s friends recognized the frailty of humanity and our propensity to sin, but their view of God is way too small. Without the context of God’s redemptive grace, we still make everything about us! In Romans 8, Paul points to the future, complete redemption of all creation as our hope in the midst of present suffering. Though we are currently “subject to futility,” all things will one day be fully “set free from the bondage” into “glorious freedom” (Romans 8:20). This is our hope.\n\n“Now in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience” (Romans 8:24–25).\n\nJob’s friends got the frailty of humanity part right, but their concept of God’s attention missed His compassionate heart. The Lord was Job’s only hope, just as He is ours. With Christ, our mere humanity is transformed into glory befitting children of God, no matter what suffering we may be experiencing at the moment.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nSoon after my parents divorced, Dad remarried. Then, he moved out of the city to forty-two acres of flat, cactus-dotted pastureland in Central Florida to pursue his dream of becoming a cattleman-rancher. I loved helping Dad take care of our small herd, especially a solid black calf we named “Inky,” whose mama died while giving birth to him. I nursed Inky with a bottle until he got strong enough to fend for himself. But it wasn’t long before that baby Hereford bonded to me and no longer wanted to stay in the pasture with the rest of the cows. Instead, he followed me around like an oversized puppy, curled up and sleeping outside the house with the our pack of snoring dogs, who completely accepted him despite the fact that he mooed rather than barked.\n\nWhen my sweet baby bull was about a year old, Dad told me it was time to assimilate him back into the pasture with the herd. I cried, insisting that he didn’t know how to be a cow anymore because he’d become part of our family. But Dad gently encouraged me to think of what was best for Inky, and so I relented. Sadly, not long after we transitioned him from pet back to farm animal, a pack of rabid dogs attacked and killed several cows in the herd, including Inky. And while Inky was a yearling big enough to defend himself, he probably didn’t because he saw dogs as friends, not as potentially dangerous foes. I was inconsolable, devastated by the realization that had I not turned Inky into a pet, he might not have been savagely attacked and killed. My less-than-tender stepmother, however, was annoyed at my grief over a “stupid cow.”\n\nI was just an 11-year-old girl at the time of that mini-tragedy, but that’s when I learned that grief is not an inclusive emotion. Deep ache tends to be an isolating event, and despair tends to put uncomfortable distance between the heartbroken and observers—especially if those observers haven’t processed their own grief and loss. It reminds me of American poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox’s most observed and enduring line: “Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep, and you weep alone.”\n\nJob certainly walked “the narrow aisles of pain” in solitude. Before the prologue of his story was even finished, he’d lost almost everyone who really mattered to him, except for his wife—who was more salt-in-his-wounds than a comfort at this point—and three so-called friends (Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar), a trio who quickly revealed their distaste for Job’s honest despair, distancing themselves from the awkward messiness of his grief with condescending admonitions. The low-blow gist of his loquacious buddy Eliphaz in chapters 4 and 5 is this: Job, you obviously have hidden sin in your life. That’s why you’re in this pit of destruction. So you may as well quit whining, because no one’s even listening to your prayers!\n\nWhen my stepmother callously referred to Inky as a “stupid cow,” she was technically correct; bovine creatures don’t have nearly as high of an intellectual capacity as humans. However, she was oblivious to the fact that I had a real bond with that baby bull, which is why she could so easily dismiss my grief as adolescent drama. And that’s essentially the chasm that becomes apparent between Job and his three miserable comforters. Not all of what they say to Job is technically wrong. In fact, most of what they say about God’s inscrutability is accurate in principle. But the spirit of their preaching is crooked because they ignore the fact that Job has a real relationship with God. And the messy, wildly honest grievances he airs actually prove the very real existence of that bond.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nI once had a surgeon tell me I wasn’t a very good patient because I tried to “gut it out,” instead of being honest about the pain I was experiencing. Apparently, it’s hard on a healer when a patient masks their symptoms; making a diagnosis can become a bit like trying to shoot at a moving target.\n\nMy doctor believed my stubborn refusal to admit pain reflected my lack of trust in his competence as a physician. In Job chapter three, we see that Job is honest about his own pain, which is a clear indicator that he truly wants to be healed and trusts in the competence of the Great Physician. It would take me a long time to learn that instead of exacerbating a painful experience, honest tears and the acknowledgment of pain can actually serve as a soothing pressure relief valve.\n\nBy contrast, between the amped-up sensation of reality television, the shrieking discord of current political affairs, and the twenty-four/seven barrage of social media that has saturated our culture, it’s entirely possible for real trauma and suffering to go unnoticed and untended. We rush to triage emotional hangnails but completely ignore the people around us who are bleeding out. Silence doesn’t always indicate bravery, but it is a pretty good indicator that we might not notice when someone is truly suffering.\n\nJob’s outburst is a healthy reminder that our Redeemer doesn’t rank our emotions on a scale from good to bad, allowing only “good” emotions like joy and peace while barring “bad” emotions like grief and disappointment. We do not have to censor ourselves before the God who knows our hearts better than we do. Scripture doesn’t instruct us to smile on the outside while we die on the inside—just the opposite, in fact (see 1 Samuel 1). Frankly, I believe one of the biggest fallacies perpetrated in communities of faith is that the closer we get to Jesus, the more we need to keep a lid on it. Stoicism is not a spiritual gift, y’all!\n\nWe need to understand there’s a colossal difference between disagreeing with God and denying His existence altogether. Job cursed the day he was born and expressed confusion, frustration, and even anger, at God over allowing tragedy to befall him—but he did not reject God. In fact, the tormented exasperation Job hurls toward God proves that he is anything but an atheist! He knows God holds all things together.\n\nFaith powered by God can stretch us far beyond our own capacity to endure. Still, it’s not our anguish that distances us from God; it’s our apathy. The main takeaway from Job chapter three: we can and should continue to bring all of who we are—including our anger, confusion, and disappointment—before God. We can trust Him with every piece of our hearts.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Setting of the Test",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nDealing honestly, wisely, and compassionately with human pain is an integral part of our job description as followers of Jesus Christ. No one gets through this life unscathed. Everyone deals with pain and suffering at some level. If someone insists she hasn’t, she’s either lying, in denial, or has amnesia. And since God’s second most important command is for us to love our neighbors as we love ourselves, it behooves us to learn how to better comfort ourselves as well as our neighbors—both those we rub shoulders with daily, and also our global neighbors, who make up the lost and dying world we’re called to care for.\n\nBut let’s deal with the proverbial bull in the china shop, which is the fact that what happened to Job wasn’t what we like to think of as “fair.” I mean, goodnight! The very beginning of this Old Testament book describes Job as a really good guy who was doing really good things with his life. The mention of Job rising early to pray for his kids (Job 1:5) is a common Hebrew idiom denoting a conscientious habit, which means praying for his family was something he did consistently.\n\nReading about this righteous guy losing pretty much everything—his wealth, his health, and all ten of his children—it’s like biting into a warm brownie and breaking your tooth on a rock. This “divine test” is surprisingly unfair. Surely Job didn’t deserve such devastating loss.\n\nIn the New Testament, Jesus blows the idea of human deservedness right out of the water. In His Sermon on the Mount, He teaches that God throws fairness out the window to bless even the unrighteous (Matthew 5:43–45). In another place, He explains that bad things do indeed happen to good people (Luke 13:1–5). And in His parable about the workers in the vineyard (Matthew 20:1–16), He thoroughly deconstructs any notion that we can earn God’s blessings.\n\nThe bottom line is this: No matter how many Bible studies we’ve done, or meals we’ve served to the homeless, we cannot earn one of those immunity sticks like they do on Survivor. None of us can get “good enough” to shield ourselves and those we love from suffering. Job proves that “good” people, including people of faith, can and do experience horrific things through no particular fault of their own. And if you want to really blow your mental hard drive, reread Job chapter 1, which suggests that while Job’s faith was truly strong, it did not safeguard him from hardship (v.8).\n\nIn the economy of God, Job’s suffering was an honor, a privilege. After all, “should we accept only good from God and not adversity?” (2:10). Our Creator and Redeemer handpicked Job for the honorable position of carrying the weight of pain. While God is not the author of evil (Psalm 5:4), He did choose Job with the foreknowledge that he would carry suffering well, because even our pain is a great conduit for God’s glory.\n\nCan you imagine how different our lives could be if we began to view some of our pain and disappointment as a divine privilege? What if we saw a difficult journey as one God handpicked us to take, knowing that He Himself would strengthen us to make the trek, and more importantly, that His glory would be illuminated through our efforts? Changing our perspective on suffering—viewing it as an honor instead of dumb luck or cruelty—could absolutely change the course of our lives and deeply impact the world around us.\n\n \n\n",

It is a way we walk through life, seeking not only to know, but to interact with the truths of God. Folly, in the biblical sense of the word, is to hold the love and pursuit of truth in contempt by choosing to make our own path. A life of wisdom or folly comes from more than just the quality of the individual decisions we make. It comes from how we approach the journey of life as a whole.\n\nThe Way of Wisdom\n\nAsk:\n\nQ. These words come near the beginning of the Book of Proverbs as a way to help us read everything that follows. What do these verses suggest is the goal of growing in wisdom?\n\nQ. According to these verses, what does wisdom give us?\n\nQ. What do you hope a month of studying God’s wisdom will produce in you?\n\nThe Way of Folly\n\nAsk:\n\nQ. Proverbs 9:13-18 describes folly as being secretive about our sin. Why is being secretive about sin foolish, and what is the value of letting trusted friends know the secrets in our lives?\n\nQ.

To truly know God, and therefore truly walk in wisdom, we must know not only what God loves, but also what He abhors.\n\nAsk:\n\nQ. Why do you think there are so many proverbs that talk about what God hates? Why is this important for us to know? \n\nQ. God hates abominations, but loves sinful people.

Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere flea bites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.” \n\nThe wise person assumes the battle between humility and pride is always raging in our hearts. These proverbs help us understand that fight.\n\nAsk:\n\nQ. Where does pride have its strongest hold on you? \n\nQ. What is the difference between self-deprecation and humility? Why do you think we employ false humility in the ways we relate to others? What do we want it to do for us? \n\nQ. In these proverbs, humility is associated with wisdom, honor, and riches. Pride, however, is associated with shame. Do you functionally live as someone who accepts these connections or as one who rejects the idea that they are related? \n\nQ. We should be people who seek to praise God for the work He is doing in us. The gospel tells us that the Holy Spirit works in the lives of believers to make us more like Jesus (Philippians 2:13). This means He is working to cultivate humility in us. Name a place in your life where you can thank God for bringing you true humility? \n\n",

What are some present-day comparisons you could make between the woman in this passage and a godly woman today? \n\nQ.

Few relationships carry greater room for pain or influence than the parent-child relationship. \n\nThe Book of Proverbs does not assume this relationship is easy, or that its health is automatic. But it does acknowledge that this relationship, potentially more than any other, has the capacity to shape a young person’s life in beautiful and lasting ways. \n\nThe wisdom given here looks very much like what Jesus described as the greatest love there is—one person laying down their life for another (John 15:13).\n\nAsk:\n\nQ.

Sometimes the seductress described in this text is a particular person (man or woman) who tries to lure another person into infidelity. But sometimes the seductress in this passage can be the unchecked longings and unaddressed pains in our own hearts, calling to us from within to succumb to temptation with the promise that it will bring us happiness. \n\nAsk:\n\nQ. Why do you suppose this passage is so personalized and told like a vivid story, as opposed to being a list of reasons why adultery is wrong? \n\nQ. Describe the temptress wooing your heart in this season of your life. \n\nQ.

It has to do with our ability to practice the fruit of the Spirit, self-control—an essential component of generosity.

    "devo_title": "A Song of Love",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Song of Songs 1:1-2:7, Psalm 45:1-17, Isaiah 11:1, 1 Corinthians 13:1-13\n\nI am such a fan of love poetry. At root, all love poetry is aiming for the same thing: connection. Although ancient love poetry has a different flavor than modern love poems, we can see the same longing for intimacy in both.\n\nFor centuries, Song of Songs was primarily read as an allegory for Christ’s love for His Church. And while a purely spiritual interpretation of the poem certainly does seem possible, we can also see from other passages of Scripture that God celebrates married love (Ephesians 5:25), and He values our human connections (John 15:17). So it is safe to read this poem as a human love story, while also noting that we can only love because we are loved by Christ (1 John 4:19). And indeed, in the history of Israel, the theme of marital unfaithfulness is a common one.\n\nAs we look at this poem, it’s helpful to have a little roadmap to give structure and understanding. Many Bible commentators point out that Song of Songs was written using a chiastic structure, meaning the poem sort of mirrors itself when it’s folded in half. So the first day parallels the last day, beginning and ending with an invitation to enjoy a spring day and culminating in the middle with the marriage.\n\nBeyond that, this love story is also structured like a play, with speakers given for each role. As you read, it might be helpful to imagine this as a stage play and see each of the speakers as characters distinct from the others.\n\nAnd finally, we can consider Song of Songs in light of God’s covenant with King David, who was Solomon’s father. God had promised David that his people would be God’s people.\n\nUnfortunately, his son Solomon didn’t have a great reputation when it came to fidelity. But through Solomon’s marriage to Shulamith, she was joined to the same covenant God had promised to David. Once an outsider, she was brought into the fullness of all the blessings afforded to David’s people, and therefore, God’s people. In this way, the poem also illuminates the beauty of God’s covenantal blessings.\n\nThe layers of imagery and complexity are rich indeed. But even without all these tools, we can  look into this intimate love poem between two lovers who lived thousands of years ago and find the truth, goodness, and beauty of the gospel. \n\nHow wonderful that God tells us the story of His love for us not only in commandments, in teachings, in lessons of history, and in the very person of His Son, but also in a love poem. God’s design for love is both intimate and grand in scale, presenting love in the context of marital fidelity and covenantal blessing. The central idea is an intimate tie: “I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine.” He protects us under His banner, and that banner is love (Song of Songs 6:3; 2:4).\n\nIn this Song, God provides us with a rich celebration of faithful love between the bridegroom and the bride. It’s about a couple on their wedding night, and it’s about a God who loves His people more than they can understand. “It is a profound mystery,” the love Christ has for the Church (Ephesians 5:32).\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: Song of Songs 2:8-17, Isaiah 62:5, Ephesians 5:31-33\n\nI had a death grip on my husband for the first decade of our marriage. So desperate was my craving to see us through “till death do us part” that I white-knuckled it in our relationship. I was determined to hold on tight enough for both of us. \n\nBut I could never fully grasp the security I craved so deeply. Holding on that tightly squeezed the love and fun out of our relationship. \n\nSince marriage is ultimately a picture of Christ and the Church, this approach to covenant love has also caused strain in my relationship with Jesus. Always secretly fearful that He would change His mind about me, I have tried to keep us glued together with works well done and duties faithfully fulfilled. \n\nBut as desperation and anxiety couldn’t bolt the door on my marriage, striving couldn’t make Jesus love me more. Through years of tender care and collisions with His Word, I am learning that security flows out of devoted love, not anxious control. \n\nIn Song of Songs, Shulamith is the soon-to-be bride of wise King Solomon, and she has her own need for security. Right before the wedding, she says these words:\n\n“My love is mine and I am his.”\n–Song of Songs 2:16\n\nBut, as Shulamith and Solomon’s love story unfolds, her tone begins to shift. After the wedding she says, “I am my love’s, and my love is mine” (6:3). Then, as Shulamith and Solomon mature into an old, married couple, she says, “I am my love’s and his desire is for me” (7:10). \n\nLet’s drag a magnifying glass over this subtle progression. \n\nAt first, Shulamith’s security is found in knowing that her man belongs to her. Her possession of him is primary; his possession of her is secondary. (As I’ve already mentioned, I’ve seen what this looks like in real life. It’s not pretty.) Then, after the wedding, Shulamith’s possession of Solomon was secondary: “I am my love’s, and my love is mine.” And finally, it’s gone altogether: “his desire is for me.” \n\nIt took decades for the bride in this story to understand that her security did not come from her possession of her groom, but from his devoted love to her. \n\nSong of Songs is much more than a human love story. As is the case throughout Scripture, God uses marriage as an illustration for the love between Himself and His people. God is always represented by the groom and we are always the bride. His love hinges on His faithfulness, not ours. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Song of Songs 3:1-5, 1 Kings 4:20-34, Isaiah 55:1-13\n\nFriends, we are so close to the wedding scene, the main event of this beautiful poem. But first, before he details wedded bliss, Solomon details the night before. After all, before the morning must always come the night. \n\nOut of the entire Song of Songs, this passage might be the one I resonate with most. Many commentaries suggest this portion represents a dream Shulamith has the night before her wedding in which she is separated from her beloved. She resolves to get out of bed and seek after him. The repetitive language shows the desperation of her quest: “I sought the one I love; I sought him, but did not find him… I will seek the one I love. I sought him, but did not find him” (Song of Songs 3:1-2).\n\nThat frustration of knowing what it is like to be united with your love, and then being suddenly separated—it is anxiety-inducing. It is frightening. The night feels dark without him. You feel lost without him, and you are not at rest until you are in his arms again. \n\nThis, I would say, is what most of our time here on earth feels like—like the night before the dawn, the night before the reuniting. We feel afraid and lost and desperate. We feel like something—someone—is missing, and we begin this search until we find it. \n\nChrist, our Beloved, has come and He is coming again. But until He does, the night feels long. \n\nSomething I like about Shulamith’s quest is how focused it is. She is looking for one person and one person only: her beloved. She doesn’t get sidetracked or distracted; she knows her heart only beats for one man. \n\nI cannot say so much for myself. Though I know what I ache and long for is actually my Savior, I have often set off on quests in the wrong direction, believing maybe this relationship or that person’s approval is actually what I need. I spend money on what is not bread and my labor on what does not satisfy (Isaiah 55:2), instead of going to the living water that has promised me life. I get confused in the night and restless, and too often this results in seeking the wrong person, place, or thing. \n\nShulamith eventually finds her love, and when she does, she holds on to him and does not let him go (Song of Songs 3:4). Think about that. When your desperate nighttime quest leads you into the arms of Christ, and you recognize Him as what your soul has been longing for this whole time—as the redemption you are so undeserving of, yet so in need of—you do not let go. You cling to the cross and thank God that the night is almost over and the morning is near. You’ve been reunited with your love, your Savior.\n\nFor now, we cling to Christ in the night. His return has not yet come, but it soon will. And when it does, the final union between us and our Bridegroom will be even more wonderful and holy and beautiful than Solomon’s poetic words can capture. Until then, may we continue our quest in the night, and may it lead us to the arms of Christ. \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Song of Songs 3:6-11, Psalm 144:1-15, Luke 12:22-31\n\nThese are the unforgettable words my best friend chose to exchange with me, her maid of honor, before walking down the aisle:\n\n“Don’t faint up there…or else.”\n\nWhile most would have taken these words as a warning regarding the air conditioning-less chapel we’d soon be standing in for the ceremony, I knew we were both bracing each other for something else. The incoming emotional swell that would accompany this banner day was headed straight for us, and we weren’t quite sure where it would land. Maybe on tear-stained cheeks or sweaty palms, or in the excitement of our hurried steps?\n\nBefore we could manage to prepare for its arrival, it was my turn to walk down the aisle, followed closely by hers. The swell arrived as a flurry of tissues and gasps overcame the guests, each as bewildered as I was by our luck at witnessing such a glorious event. \n\nHer face was ablaze with joy, but the feeling didn’t culminate until I glanced over at the flame’s source—her groom. His stance remained as steady as the stream of tears that fell from his face. It was the day of his heart’s rejoicing, and his joy caused a swell in our own hearts too. \n\nI brace myself with this same kind of anticipation when we get to Song of Songs 3. Scripture tells us the wedding guests participated in Solomon’s own rejoicing as his attendants rose from the wilderness like clouds of smoke and his mother placed a crown on his head. Beauty and nature linked arms for this lavish celebration of love and promise, every detail covered and each onlooker provided for. \n\nI hope the wedding guests didn’t miss it. I hope they turned their heads to behold the groom’s face, the evidence of his heart’s rejoicing. I hope we don’t miss our Groom’s joy, either. As we observe the details of this elaborate wedding day, we may feel like we’re only onlookers of Solomon and Shulamith’s vows. But we forget, the same vows have been made to us by God. \n\n “Consider how the wildflowers grow: They don’t labor or spin thread. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was adorned like one of these! If that’s how God clothes the grass, which is in the field today and is thrown into the furnace tomorrow, how much more will He do for you—you of little faith?”  -Luke 12:27-28\n\nNot even the day of Solomon’s heart’s rejoicing compares to the way our own hearts rejoice— partly now, in knowing Christ, and fully then, in seeing Christ (1 Corinthians 13:12). This passageway called Earth is the aisle we walk to our perfect love, perfect peace, perfect Prince. May we never take our eyes off Him, acknowledging the way His heart rejoices over His bride. Amen. \n\nHappy are the people with such blessings.\nHappy are the people whose God is Yahweh.\n-Psalm 144:15\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Song of Songs 4:1-16, Proverbs 4:23, Revelation 22:1-5\n\nI once had a box of love letters that I kept way past their expiration date.\n\nThe author of the letters was a boy I knew when I was a teenager. We lived in different states, met at a church event, and “dated” – or something? – long distance for a while, seeing each other only a handful of times. This was back when high school kids didn’t have email addresses and dinosaurs roamed the earth, so letter-writing was our primary means of communication. You know—paper and pens, envelopes and stamps. \n\nI kept those letters long after the boy and our young relationship faded away, and thinking back on it, I’m not exactly sure why. It wasn’t because I was pining for the boy himself—I hardly knew him, after all. I think I kept them because of my feelings for feelings.\n\nI liked remembering the anticipation the distance between us created, and the way my stomach did flips each time his handwriting appeared in my mailbox. I liked recalling the connection I felt as I read his letters, even though they were about normal things like school or work or car trouble. (He drove an Acura, my high school dream car. You can see the appeal.)\n\nLove—even faint glimpses of it—forces us to feel. Romantic love awakens our senses, making us keenly aware of our built-in longing for intimacy and connection. Maybe this is one of the reasons God included this human love letter in the middle of His divine love letter to us: to wake us up.  \n\nAs we read today in Chapter 4, Solomon could hardly contain himself when it came to Shulamith. He enthusiastically praised every part of his beautiful bride, comparing her hair to “a flock of goats,” her brow to “a slice of pomegranate”—even rejoicing that she has all her teeth! We roll our eyes at the absurdity of his metaphors because we know his bride was human and imperfect, but at the same time, we get it. Whether we’ve experienced the thrill of romantic love firsthand or just blushed at the thought of it, we can imagine the weightless feeling that comes from a stolen glance, or the electricity of a first kiss.\n\nReading this love song out loud makes me uncomfortable, like I’m eavesdropping on a private conversation. But you know what? It does not shock or embarrass God. He created us for relationship and established boundaries in which those relationships can flourish and honor Him. Solomon is finally joining with his bride, and we don’t have to be embarrassed about it. The Bible celebrates it! \n\nLove, relationships, and yes, even sex, remind us that we are alive—created by a God who loves us, and created to love each other. We misuse and abuse His gifts—and pain, tears, and shame result when we do—but the gifts themselves are good. Solomon is right to rejoice.\n\nLove and its songs are grand, but there is only one love that fulfills our expectations. Christ’s love for the Church has no blemishes or flaws; He never falters or forgets. And while love here on earth comes with its share of heartache and tears, the fulfillment of our heart’s truest desire will not disappoint. “He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There won’t be death anymore. There won’t be any grief, crying, or pain, because the first things have disappeared” (Revelation 21:4).\n\nThere will be no more eye rolling, no more shame—only the ultimate joy and perfect peace that comes from being in the presence of God. We are most alive when we are joined with Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Song of Songs 5:1-16, Psalm 128:1-6, Colossians 3:12-17\n\nLove makes me uncomfortable. It makes me feel vulnerable and exposed, like the whole world can read my innermost thoughts. Love catches me off guard, it clouds my decision-making, it questions my motives. Love causes me to frantically build walls, and then love tears them all down. Love feels risky. I’m uncomfortable with risk.\n\nIn chapter 5 of Song of Songs, our young couple is newly married and experiencing all the highs that come with that emotional milestone. But, as is true with human love, the highs are accompanied with lows, the pendulum of emotion often swinging dramatically between the two.\n\nMany scholars believe this passage to be the description of a dream. So while Shulamith may not literally be searching the street for her love or beaten by the city guards, her vivid description helps us understand her emotional state. Her deep love for Solomon makes her feel euphoria, that “intoxication” with love promoted by the narrator in 5:1, as well as desperation, the lovesickness that comes with these overwhelming feelings (5:8).\n\nThe part that intrigues me most about this passage is what Shulamith does with this range of emotion. She does not camp out in either extreme, but rather chooses to confirm, once again, her love for her beloved. Even amid her emotional struggle, she recounts her bridegroom’s attributes, summing them up in one telling declaration: “This is my love, and this is my friend” (5:16). She returns to and affirms their love, despite the vulnerability it demands.\n\nIs this picture of the “work” of love—this constant turning and returning when emotions run awry—what we expect when we think of love and happiness? I’m not sure it is. Take Psalm 128, for example. Too often when I come to Scripture, I want to sit in a safe place like verse 2: “You will be happy, and it will go well for you.” Great! Let’s stay here, yeah? But the psalmist makes it clear that true happiness is not a destination, a place where we arrive and set up camp. Instead, he exclaims, “How happy is everyone who fears the Lord, who walks in His ways!” (v.1).\n\nHappiness involves a posture of fearing and following God. He is the God who teaches us that love is active, not passive; the God who made the ultimate demonstration of His love by laying down His life for ours (Romans 5:8).\n\nThis world is passing away, and even those vows exchanged between a couple hopelessly in love, like our bride and groom in Song of Songs, aren’t certain (Matthew 24:35). Promises of love and the realities of relationship involve emotional and circumstantial trials, with bright highs and dark lows. Only the vows made by God Himself are certain to last.\n\nThe good news is, God did make vows to us. Those vows are called a covenant, and Christ is our down payment of its fulfillment (2 Corinthians 1:21-22). We can love one another because He loved us first (1 John 4:19).\n\nGod’s love for you and me is more than a feeling; it is a choice. He planned, from the beginning of time, to rescue us from sin and darkness, from false loves and shame. Even in our most intimate of relationships, we rely on Christ’s perfect love to enable us to love—today, and tomorrow, and all the days after that. Thanks be to God.   \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Song of Songs 6:1-13, Psalm 48:1-14, Romans 12:1-2, 12:9-13\n\nThe word “garden” gives me heart palpitations. Although I come from a long line of green thumbs, I only remember to water the plant sitting on my coffee table approximately once every three weeks. The friends who gave it to me as a birthday gift promised it was a low-maintenance variety, heavy on the grace. Unfortunately, I’m heavy on forgetfulness.\n\nWe seem to be doing okay so far, this little plant and me. But the thought of having a whole garden has me pre-grieving the blooms that would be under my care. I did once live across the way from the most wonderful garden—one that made me set aside my preconceived notions and wish for a greener thumb. It was in the center of a thriving artist community, and quickly became my favorite place to gather my people. We spent afternoons sprawled out on blankets, surrounded by those who came to make art with their hands, their paintbrushes, or their conversation.\n\nGod loves to gather His people in gardens, too. And not only that—it’s also where He does His best art, growing up glory as only The Creator God can. From Eden, the garden of sin; to Gethsemane, the garden of suffering; to Golgotha, the garden of victory; and to eternal paradise, or “garden of delight”—we see that clearly, God faithfully waters what He plants. \n\nMatthew Henry tells us, “Christ’s church is a garden enclosed, and separated from the open common of the world; it is his garden, which he has planted as he did the garden of Eden, which he takes care of, and delights in.” I think that was my favorite part about my own neighborhood garden: because someone else delighted in it and cared for it, I could enjoy its beauty. I’m still in awe of that individual who was so fruitful in an area where I was so lacking. \n\nWhile gardens are a recurring theme in Scripture, Song of Songs highlights just how lush and beautiful gardens—and love—can truly be.\n\nMy love has gone down to his garden,\nto beds of spice,\nto feed in the gardens\nand gather lilies.\nI am my love’s and my love is mine;\nhe feeds among the lilies.\n-Song of Songs 6:2-3\n\nThe garden is a delight, but what we see happening inside its walls is even more beautiful. The couple is lavishing honor on one another, making clear their love by the way they hold one another up above themselves. The self-sacrifice of the One who is love does the same for us—His bride, the Church. He cares for us and tends to us, but even more than that, He reconciles us to Himself. \n\nIt was in a garden that paradise was found and lost.\nIt was in a garden that we are lost and found.\n\nIn gardens, God calls His Beloved in and teaches us about Himself. He reminds us of the ways He has provided for the soil, so that we might remember He is also tending to our hearts. Only when we learn more about the Gardener and the soil of redemption we’ve been planted in, do we begin to see that our broken seeds of faith will grow into holy and living sacrifices after all (Romans 12:1). \n\nWe are His Beloved, and His faithful love endures forever (Psalm 118:1).\n\nHallelujah.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Song of Songs 7:1-9, Ephesians 5:22-30, Revelation 19:6-10\n\nI have to admit, today’s reading was a hard one for me, and not because of the descriptive language. As it’s been said throughout this study, Song of Songs can be read as an allegorical text—a poem that parallels God’s love for Israel and points toward Christ’s love for the Church. When I read Song of Songs 7:1-9 in light of Ephesians 5:22-30, I noticed a depth to Christ’s love for us that I hadn’t really considered before, and, if I’m being honest, am still grappling with now.\n\nFor some reason, it’s easier to formalize Jesus’ love for us, the Church—to think of Him as a benevolent politician who cares for His people. It’s easier for me to keep Christ’s love at a distance, to imagine Him standing at a podium, rather than by my side. But this is not the type of love we see in Song of Songs. \n\nIf the way Solomon speaks of his bride is any indication as to how Christ views us, His bride, then He’s in no way a distant politician waving to a crowd. What we see in Chapter 7 is a deep, intimate, and passionate affection.\n\nSolomon and Shulamith have been reconciled after a time apart, and upon their reuniting Solomon praises his bride’s body and character. He knows every inch of her, every curve and feature. Not one part of her goes unnoticed, unpraised, or unaccepted. Solomon has nothing to say about Shulamith but adoring words of love, devotion, and awe. She is “the handiwork of a master” (Song of Songs 7:1).\n\nThis is what made me feel uncomfortable while reading these verses. To allow yourself to be loved in this way takes an incredible amount of vulnerability. To be examined and aware of your every flaw and sin, then be told you are the exact opposite of how you see yourself—that you’re actually the beloved and beautiful handiwork of a master—is a truth that can sometimes be harder to live with than the lie of shame.\n\nYet, this is what Christ’s passionate affection means for us. As Ephesians 5 says, “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless” (Ephesians 5:25-27). \n\nBecause of Jesus’ atonement for our sin, this is who we now are: holy, blameless, without stain or wrinkle. \n\nThere is an element in our relationship with Christ that requires great vulnerability from us if we are to fully experience His great love. For the striving, earning, and achieving Christian—as well as the guilt-ridden one—this may be one of the greatest challenges of the Christian life: to let ourselves be loved by Him. To allow Him to examine us and declare us good and right and lovely in His sight. \n\nI wonder what would change in your life and mine if we allowed ourselves to bask in Jesus’ love for us, as Shulamith does in Solomon’s—to just sit in it and learn to accept and embrace it. I wonder how we would see ourselves, those around us, and how it would change our relationship with our Savior. \n\nI pray this is the new truth we walk in today: that we would see the purity and passion in Christ’s affection for us, and that we would walk in confidence as His beloved. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Song of Songs 7:10-8:4, Genesis 3:14-19, Psalm 85:10\n\nWhen asked how he and my grandmother met, my grandfather would tell us, “I came to town and asked where the prettiest girl lived.” The rest, as they say, was history. \n\nAlthough I never learned the actual details of their first date, I can imagine Papa was far more nervous than he’d let on, and that Grandmother had spent the afternoon prior positioning the rollers in her hair just so. I don’t know what they ate for dinner or what jokes made them laugh, but I do know it led to a second date, and that Papa became a regular visitor and eventual husband to the prettiest girl in town. What began as an invitation to dinner became a call and a promise to choose their relationship again and again.\n\nInvitations are exciting, but second invitations are better. In Song of Songs, we see Solomon and Shulamith enjoy a spring day together twice, but much has happened between these two significant days. This is where, if we were to fold Song of Songs in half, the two spring days would serve almost as a call and response. \n\nThe first spring day, in chapter 2, is during courtship—Solomon invites Shulamith to leave her house and enjoy a spring day with him, and concludes with a request to hear her voice (2:14). The second, in chapters 7-8, is during marriage, and this time it’s Shulamith extending the invitation to enjoy a new spring day, concluding with a request for intimacy (8:14).\n\nAren’t you glad Solomon didn’t stop with their “happily ever after” wedding? The second half of this book is filled with the good stuff, the kind of stories their grandchildren got to witness. Shulamith’s invitation is also extended to us, an opportunity to see a past the lavish celebration to what’s next. There, we find that though the lovers find themselves in a “new” spring season, the covenant has come with them, just as they promised. They kept choosing each other.  Self-sacrificing love has built the trustworthy covenant borders in which intimate love can reside. \n\nWe’re not told precisely what kept their love alive day to day. Maybe one offered to do dishes and the other loved to put away laundry. The Song gives us tiny glimpses into their trials, but a little research behind their names may give us a clue as to how their partnership worked. “Solomon” means “peace-giver,” and “Shulamith” means “peace-receiver,” illustrating the active ebb and flow of an intimate relationship. \n\nActive, too, is the relationship between Christ and the Church. He gives peace; we receive it. As Solomon and Shulamith remain belonging to one another in their faithfulness, so we remain Christ’s in His faithfulness to us. \n\n“Faithful love and truth will join together; righteousness and peace will embrace.”   -Psalm 85:10\n\nGod is actively keeping His promises to us. He continues to invite us into His covenant, reminding us of His faithful love again and again. We’re invited to enjoy fresh mercies and kept promises with Him today, tomorrow, and forever. Thanks be to God. \n\n",

Can you remember a time you blushed with delighted surprise? Sometimes I blush over gifts and sometimes I blush about compliments, but my cheeks were at their rosiest when I first met my love. There’s a certain look he used to give me that told me he was utterly slain by me—and, oh, how it made my cheeks burn. The surprises of love, the power of love, and love’s delights are the sweetest things I have ever experienced.\n\nGod didn’t have to allow us to fall in love with each other. I imagine that we could theoretically procreate, carry on the species, and get our jobs done without love. But God is love, and He gave us the subtle delights of love to hold all of life’s pieces together. Love elevates the mundane to magical. \n\nEarly on in our relationship, I remember us sitting in a car together; we talked and he touched my fingers—that was all. But when the car door opened for me to get out, I literally fell on the ground, I was so incapacitated. God didn’t have to let us fall ridiculously in love with each other. But He made us for love!\n\nSong of Songs makes me blush. In fact, it makes me blush like a wedding night makes us blush—at the surprise and joy of intimacy.\n\nThere are two beautiful parallels between Christ as the bridegroom to the Church and the husband as bridegroom to his bride that stand out: People who love each other desire time together, and they pursue that time with one another in spite of obstacles.\n\n“A huge torrent cannot extinguish love.” Have you ever longed to be with your beloved? We desire that Christ will write our name on His heart and in His book. He has done this, saying, “look, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands” (Isaiah 49:16). And He invites us to write His name as a seal on our own hearts (Song of Songs 8:6-7).\n\n“Rivers cannot sweep it away.” Have you ever loved in spite of obstacles? Just as the pains of disappointed love are like a death, the love of Christ for the Church is as strong as death. Our love for Christ makes us dead to everything else. Indeed, we cannot be separated from the love of Christ even by death (Romans 8:38, Song of Songs 8:7).\n\nWithout love we have nothing (1 Colossians 13:1). God’s intimate adoration cannot be bought or traded; we can’t earn it. It is impossible, inexplicable, and overwhelming. Just like falling in love.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hosea 1:1-11, Titus 3:4-7\n\nI spent many years being a wanderer. In many ways, I still am.\n\nMy heart is easily distracted by false loves, things I imagine will bring me life when all they really do is pry my eyes from the truer life I’ve already been given.\n\nWhen David and I got married, a family friend—a man his father’s age who’d known David since he was a boy—pulled him aside a day before the ceremony. The words he spoke were not merely advice; they were a mandate, an imperative. Be faithful to your wife, he said. You aren’t immune to infidelity; don’t give yourself the opportunity.\n\nNot a year goes by where we do not remember his advice, admitting our brokenness to one another and praying God’s grace on the promise we made all those years ago.  \n\nAt heart, I am Gomer. I am a woman who sabotages love in spite of what I know to be true. I did it when I was younger, “looking for love in all the wrong places,” as the old country song puts it. And I do it now, looking for love in the praise of others, in social media likes, and even in the refrigerator late at night. I hear the call of my false loves every day. And every day, I hear the faithful call of my One True Love, the God who made me for love in the first place.\n\nHere is what the Lord said to the prophet Hosea when Israel was going her adulterous way:\n\nGo and marry a promiscuous wife\nand have children of promiscuity,\nfor the land is committing blatant acts of promiscuity\nby abandoning the Lord.\n-Hosea 1:2\n\nThe word “promiscuous” here is a heavy word. Other versions translate it as “wife of whoredom,” “wife of harlotry,” or even “prostitute.” The woman God was calling Hosea to pursue was not just double-minded; she was actively and consistently deceitful, disloyal, and devious. She was all of us.\n\nIsrael was caught in a cycle of sin, and God was ready to get her attention. Hosea was to show Israel her sin, literally, by taking an unfaithful wife and being faithful to her.\n\nGod’s judgment on His unfaithful people was more than clear. They were not fit to be His people. They were not fit to be His, period. And yet…\n\nYet the number of the Israelites\nwill be like the sand of the sea…\nAnd in the place where they were told:\nYou are not My people,\nthey will be called: Sons of the living God.\n-Hosea 1:9-10\n\nThe Lord, the perfect and faithful One, would have mercy, grace, and compassion on Israel, the always-unfaithful ones. God said of Israel, “I will deliver them by the Lord their God. I will not deliver them by bow, sword, or war, or by horses and cavalry” (Hosea 1:7). This would be no worldly rescue. This would be the promised salvation of God’s people by the Almighty God Himself, a promise established from the first sin of the first man and woman in the first book of the Bible (Genesis 3:15).\n\nThe consequences of sin were real and painful, but the rescue would come—not by the merit of those being rescued, but because of the merciful grace of God.\n\nAnd that, friends, is the theme of this book we begin reading today. The book of Hosea is a treatise on the unworthiness of sinners and the graciousness of God. We are wanderers, all of us. We run after false loves while the Father runs after us. But, praise the Lord, His faithfulness is greater than our sin.\n\nHe saved us— not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to His mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit. -Titus 3:5\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: Hosea 2:1-13, Ezekiel 21:1-7\n\nWhen I was in college, I volunteered as a Young Life leader. That meant I spent my afternoons driving to a local high school, only to awkwardly walk through the cafeteria, trying to befriend high school girls, and eventually, tell them about Jesus. \n\nEvery summer, we took hoards of high schoolers to a camp in Colorado, where we promised they’d have the “best week of their lives.” Midnight obstacle courses, pool parties, and delicious family-style meals were all punctuated by “club,” a gathering where we’d scream songs at the top of our lungs, and then later quiet down and listen to a speaker talk about God and this man called Jesus. About three days in, the speaker stopped talking about God and started talking about sin, something he told hundreds of teenagers they were powerless to fix.\n\nThat day was never fun. And neither is today’s passage from Hosea.  \n\nHad I read these verses a few years ago, I would have written a true but shallow reflection. Something about how angry God gets at our sin, and how grateful we should be for Jesus. Back then, I knew I was an adulterer theoretically. But practically speaking, I’d done a pretty good job of following the rules. \n\nNow, here I am, reading these verses with new eyes, on the other side of a marathon of misplaced affections. Angry at God and threatening to sabotage my relationships and even my marriage, I chased down false loves I knew were off limits to me: a job that took me away from home, clothes and experiences that were out of my budget, a belief that freedom existed outside the walls of my life rather than within them. I ran hard. God wasn’t giving me what I wanted, so I pursued other gods instead.\n\nNow, here I am, reading from God’s Word, “This is what the Lord says: I am against you” (Ezekiel 21:3). Are there any more terrifying words? But when I am pursuing sin, I need the Lord to oppose me. I need the Lord to intervene.\n\nOn a Saturday in April, sitting in a grassy field in the middle of Tennessee, I held a cell phone to my ear and cried my eyes out to a dear friend who had watched me choose that futile path. “I’ve been running for so long,” I cried to her. And her response came slowly, softly. “That’s the thing about God. When you’re running, He’s in hot pursuit. And He will take you down.” \n\nLet me say this from firsthand experience: getting taken down by God doesn’t always feel good. The New Testament tells us that God’s kindness leads us to repentance (Romans 2:4). But that kindness, in the moment, may not always feel so kind. It can be mortifying. Embarrassing. Oftentimes, it is public, because our Lord is the King of bringing things from darkness into the light (Luke 1:79). \n\nHe could turn us back to Him with a soft and tender hand, and often, He does. But sometimes, His kindness comes with thornbushes, with walls in our way (Hosea 2:6). With shipwrecks and blindness and the belly of a whale. He turns us back with Calvary—the bloodiest kindness of all. \n\nThat’s what made those days in Colorado so powerful: watching teenagers learn the joy of a grace that is greater than our sin. God has once and for all redeemed our lives with the cross. We are His. And because He is holy and loving, and because we are His children, He will not tolerate our false gods or sit idly by while we run from Him. \n\nPraise God, He takes us down.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Hosea 2:14-23, 2 Samuel 12:1-10\n\nMan, I love being on the right side of an argument. \n\nBeing “righteously right” is more satisfying to me than a dark chocolate-covered pretzel (and those are pretty darn good). Sure, I’ll forgive you—just as long as you know I’m the one administering the mercy, and you’re the one admitting your shortcoming. It’s restoration on my terms and with my limits. You’re welcome.\n\nNot super attractive. Not to my kids, not to my husband, not to the people I work with, and not to the One seated on the Mercy Seat. \n\nBut mercy isn’t about our righteousness. We don’t grant mercy because we are more and someone else is less. We grant mercy because we have been granted mercy. Period. We watch God, in His Word and in our own lives, act in mercy toward us every day. He requires us to repent but He doesn’t make us grovel. He invites us, just like He invited Israel, to return from how very wrong we are. And He makes us right because He is righteous. Because we have been shown real mercy, we can begin to learn to show the same.\n\nDo you see the way God demonstrates mercy to His people in today’s reading? Israel is wronger than wrong—deeply unfaithful and offensive—and God makes plans to allure His unfaithful bride with tenderness. And my favorite: He promises to make the Valley of Achor (also known as the “Valley of Trouble,” a place synonymous with sin and death) into “a gateway of hope” (Hosea 2:15). Not even a gate—a gateway!\n\nGod makes it easy for us to come home too. He laid out the welcome mat for unfaithful Israel in spite of their wandering and unwillingness to return His faithfulness. God’s unrelenting love was just that—it never stopped inviting. And it never stops inviting and pursuing us. Not only does God’s faithful love save us, it also teaches us. It shows us how to show mercy—how to be unrelenting in our tenderness, offering gateways of hope because the same has been done for us. \n\nAs we read the book of Hosea, we learn no one is beyond the reach of God’s forgiveness. No one is too wrong to receive mercy. God may bring judgment and consequence for our sins, but His ultimate aim is restoration, as demonstrated even in the way He renamed Hosea’s children. \n\nHe calls us His people too. He calls you His person. His Word teaches us—from Eden’s fig leaves, to Hosea’s family, to the very line of David—that God is in the eternal business of turning condemnation into restoration. This restoration is for us to receive, and for us to offer to others. Being righteously right won’t get us anywhere, but joining the Father in His business of restoration is work worth doing well. Receive His invitation today, friend. Receive His mercy. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Hosea 3:1-5, Romans 5:6-8, Exodus 20:1-3\n\nIt started the way these things always do. I ate a cookie and wanted another one. \n\nBut here’s the catch: Although it tasted like gooey, chocolatey goodness, it was technically considered a protein bar, something you’d proudly toss in your workout bag. But delicious and permissible? These things do not just happen. I felt like I’d unlocked THE secret to eternal snacking bliss. \n\nGomer’s story starts the same way. She was hungry for love, and she had it in her husband, Hosea. But she wanted more. Her desire was delicious and permissible—until it wasn’t. And Hosea was left with something far from what he’d hoped for, not unlike the cardboard box that had arrived at my door a few weeks later. \n\nThat box was unexpectedly heavy, underscoring the compromises I’d made on flavor and price in exchange for a pantry filled with a lifetime supply of healthy “cookies.” As I opened the box, red and green labels signaled that my online order of “seasonal” and “limited edition” delights actually meant Christmas (it was May) and crusty (with mold, you guys). So here I am, stuck with a pantry full of rotten, non-returnable snacks. Incidentally, can I interest anyone in a “Snickerdoodle”? \n\nAlthough I’m unsure about their stance on snickerdoodles, we know the Israelites loved raisin cakes. They piled them high and gorged themselves full in observance of the law and idol-worship. We see an illustration of their rebellion through Gomer; their pursuits of dried fruits and her chase after pitted romance would not lead to the one True Vine. \n\nAs a result, Hosea and Gomer’s marriage exited the honeymoon phase quickly—but they aren’t the only ones. Before we point fingers or assign blame, we ought to remember this truth: God is in a terrible marriage, too—with us—one He should have divorced from long ago.\n\nHe loved us first.\nWe loved sin more.\nHe made us without shame.\nWe dirtied the white dress.\nHe gave us a covenant.\nWe didn’t show up to the altar.\n\nYou cannot know how many healthy cookie bars are stuffed in each of my kitchen cabinets, a daily reminder of my unexpected, unwanted purchase. I can’t help but wonder: Was Hosea filled with the same regret? Is God? \n\nHosea is fully aware of Gomer’s adultery, yet God tells him to pursue her still.\n\n“Go again; show love to a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, just as the Lord loves the Israelites though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes” (Hosea 3:1).\n\nHosea doesn’t have enough money to buy her back, so he pays for her with 15 shekels and 5 bushels—the price of a slave (Exodus 21:32). \n\nGod is all-knowing of our unfaithfulness, yet He pursues us still. He gives everything He has to buy us back, paying for us with His Son and a cross—the price for the ungodly (Romans 5:6).\n\nWe are His runaway brides, but He will not divorce us. May we return to Him with awe. Amen. \n\n“Then God spoke all these words: I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery. Do not have other gods besides Me.”\n-Exodus 20:1-3\n\n",

    "devo_title": "God’s Case Against Israel",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nText: Hosea 4:1-19, Proverbs 19:2, 2 Corinthians 4:3-6\n\nI was raised in the church, which means I speak “Christian” rather fluently.\n\nTerms like “quiet time” and “sinner’s prayer,” or cautionary calls to “guard your heart” and “pray for a hedge of protection”—I know all the buzz words. When I went to seminary, I learned even bigger words like “sanctification” and “justification.” Between my background and my education, you could say I know a lot about the Bible. \n\nHowever, I need to confess something about all that “knowledge.” Sometimes, I coast on it. Sometimes, I rely on my familiarity with Scripture, instead of actually opening up God’s Word. Sometimes, I assume what Jesus’ response would be, instead of looking it up for myself. Sometimes, I quote verses that fit the situation, instead of exploring Scripture for a fresh perspective. And sometimes, I substitute vague, scattered prayers for intentional time in God’s Word.\n\nI can go weeks without actually reading the Bible, and no one will ever know. I can mask my neglected faith as a flourishing one, simply because I know the right answers. \n\nBut I can’t do it for long because I am a human being, and human beings forget. We forget God’s faithfulness and we forget His truths, which means we must return to His Word daily. Like water, like food, we must consume Scripture day after day, because our broken minds will struggle to recall it. No matter how familiar we are with God’s Word, we will forget it.\n\nThis is exactly what happened to the Israelites in Hosea. Israel was a people whose history was intertwined with God. His Word and His truth were written into their very identity. And yet, God had this against them:\n\n“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge” (Hosea 4:6).\n\nAccording to Old Testament scholar David Allan Hubbard, this “knowledge” refers specifically to the knowledge of God, a knowledge the Israelite priests had failed to pass on. The people of Israel had, collectively, forgotten who they were. They had forgotten whose they were. And throughout chapter 4, we see the terrible consequences of their forgetting. \n\nWhen you know a lot about God, it’s tempting to take that knowledge for granted. It’s easy to treat your soul like a hard drive, as if you can download the data and click “save.” But our hearts and our minds are more like leaky buckets. Given enough time away from the source, all the water eventually drains out. \n\nProverbs 19:2 tells us, “Desire without knowledge is not good, and whoever makes haste with his feet misses his way.” This verse discourages us from rushing to judgment, or letting our emotions carry us away, but it also has something larger in view. This verse is about the entirety of the Christian life. No matter your upbringing, no matter your desire to serve God, your soul requires daily doses of the knowledge of God. Without it, your heart will slowly wander astray. \n\nIn that sense, the story of the Israelites is a cautionary tale. The Israelites weren’t any different from you and me. They simply forgot. The truth of God, which gives freedom and life, was not a part of their daily diet, so their souls began to stray, and their lifestyles followed.\n\nI am always amazed at how easily we forget. No matter what God does, we forget. Without the “daily bread” of His Word, we can’t remember how to live. That is why, I suspect, there is a deeper invitation behind the simple words, “Hear the word of the Lord.” It’s not just a call to listen, but a call to life.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hosea 5:1-15, Isaiah 29:15-16, Revelation 3:19\n\nWe’d picked out the brown velvet curtains at Ikea not long after we got married, and hemmed them with the iron-on adhesive strip that came in the package. They hung in our first home and then in our second, even though they were about a foot too short with the higher ceilings and taller windows. I always meant to get around to changing them, or at least mending the falling-out hem; but come 2009, I decided I didn’t mind.\n\nShe was 2 years old that year, with wild, thin hair that stuck straight up and a smile so bright it could knock you out. Those too-short curtains were the perfect hiding place for her new favorite game: hide and seek.\n\nI have a few precious minutes of video of the usual scene: our little girl hiding conspicuously behind the brown dining room curtains, her pink sneakers poking out at the bottom and her giggle audible from the other side of the room. Her papa would sneak up slowly and the giggles would get louder, and she would squeal with delight as he threw back the curtain. Hiding was fun, but the true joy was being found.\n\nHosea chapter 5 is a painful read. Israel was playing hide and seek with her God, but this was no game. The people’s very lives were at stake, yet they kept turning to dead idols that reaped only destruction and desolation.\n\nGod warned them through the prophet. His tone, gentle and wooing in the first chapters, had become booming, insistent, firm. The call from the Lord was clear: Come back to Me. If you run, disaster awaits. I’m not saying it might destroy you; I’m saying it will.\n\nYet Israel was “determined to follow what is worthless” (v. 11). In verse 4, the prophet proclaimed:\n\n“Their actions do not allow them\nto return to their God,\nfor a spirit of promiscuity is among them,\nand they do not know the Lord.”\n\nThe sin did not disqualify them from returning and repenting; it kept them from returning and repenting. God’s warning to Israel was His mercy to them; so was His discipline. God turned away so that they might turn back to Him (v. 15).\n\nThe priests and the people of Israel hid in their idolatry and their sacrifices, hoping their rituals might hide their hearts. But there is no hiding from God. He sees all; and, even more, He knows all (v. 3). But as we often do, Israel hid anyway, their tell-tale sneakers sticking out from under the curtains of their sin. We hide, believing we know better, believing we and our “little-g” gods can outsmart the one true God.\n\nWe hide, but He seeks us out. He seeks us out so that we will seek Him.\n\nIsrael’s attempts at deceiving God resulted in her injury, just as He said it would. She turned to her little-g gods for healing (v. 13), and God kept pursuing. Like a lion, He prowled in guard of her heart, doing whatever it took to frustrate her desires for lesser loves, to thwart her attempts to run and hide (v. 14).\n\nAre you hiding today? I am. I feel the Holy Spirit calling my heart to return from places where I’ve gone to hide from my sin, to hide from my own brokenness. Hear our God speak words of hard, merciful truth to us, His children:\n\nI know you, He says. You are not hidden from me.\nYou turn to false loves, but they cannot cure you. They cannot heal your wounds.\nSeek me. Return and repent (vv. 3, 14-15, my paraphrase).\n\nDear friend, there is joy in having the darkest parts of our hearts uncovered by our merciful Father. Surrender to the knowledge that you are known. You’ve been found out, you’ve been found, and you are loved.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessie Minassian\n\nText: Hosea 6:1-7:2, Matthew 12:1-8, Isaiah 26:16-19\n\nAs a church culture kid, brought up on the lap of youth group events, Christian concerts, Bible camp, and the Awana Olympics, I somehow got the impression that overseas mission work was the highest calling a Christian could have. I truly and passionately loved God, so if that’s where the faith-action was, then that’s where I wanted to be. \n\nTo a wide-eyed high-schooler, anxious for adventure and an uncommon life, the abnormality of mission work appealed to me. I was ready to sacrifice BIG for God. But if I’m honest, that was mostly because I thought a missionary life sounded kind of flashy—daring, and even religiously “successful.”\n\nI took a handful of short-term trips (which, in all reality, probably benefitted me more than the people I went to serve), but I never became a career missionary, not in the way I had pictured, anyway. I was willing, but God had a different plan for my life. Today, my “mission field” looks strangely more like my childhood home than the jungles of the Amazon. \n\nMaybe you’ve wrestled through that tension, too. Can we be faithful to God in the ordinary, or do we have to do “big things” for God for our faith to be legitimate? \n\nIn Ephesians 4:1, Paul urges believers to “live worthy of the calling [we] have received.” But what does that actually look like? Hosea 6:6 helps us:\n\n“For I desire faithful love and not sacrifice,\nthe knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.”\n\nThis verse shows us what God considers the highest devotion to Him, what He wants most: faithful love over sacrifice, a relationship with Him over our offerings.\n\nHave you ever had a nagging suspicion that giant sacrifices come more easily than quiet faithfulness? I have. It was easier to dream of living in a foreign land, leading whole villages to Christ, than it is to actually live a quiet, largely unknown, completely unflashy, but faithful life. To be loyal to God even when His plan for me doesn’t make for a great Christmas card.\n\nGod still expected the Israelites to bring the prescribed offerings and sacrifices to the altar. But those things weren’t what He wanted most of all. \n\nSo why would God prefer loyalty and faithfulness over big sacrifices? The answer is the echo of the love story woven throughout the Bible’s pages: God wants our hearts. He is jealous for our affection. He wants loyalty and faithfulness because that’s what you bring to the table when you are hopelessly in love with someone. He wants us to be head-over-heels for Him, and when we are, sacrifices will come easily. \n\nWhether our faithfulness takes us to the ends of the earth or leaves us right where we are, remember what He’s really after: us.\n\n",

Ephraim is unturned bread baked on a griddle. Foreigners consume his strength, but he does not notice. Even his hair is streaked with gray, but he does not notice. Israel’s arrogance testifies against them, yet they do not return to the Lᴏʀᴅ their God, and for all this, they do not seek him” (Hosea 7:8-10).\n\nHave you noticed something here?\n\nEphraim (the largest of the ten northern tribes, whose name is sometimes used to refer to Israel as a whole) has become an out-of-control, hot mess. Meanwhile, the people of Israel are so crazed with self-indulgence they can hardly tell what day it is. But I can’t help standing back a bit and noticing, in all of Israel’s wayward mindlessness as they run to Egypt and Assyria and every which way, God hasn’t changed.\n\nOh, He’s definitely watching. He sees them spiraling out of control, tossing their reputation out the window. He hears the other nations all whispering to each other about “God’s Chosen People” killing off their leaders, one by one, and getting fresh starts from their God, only to get all muddy again (Hosea 7:16).\n\nIsrael is two-faced and double-tongued.\n\nBut if we turn our attention from the squeaky wheel for a moment—if we tune out all the noise—we’ll notice this: God has not changed.\n\nHe has but one face and one tongue. One unrelenting love for His bride.\n\nWe want this passage to be about the rogue bride, or the prodigal son, and how Israel can’t seem to get it right. But it isn’t. It’s about God.\n\nGod’s character never changes. His one face is righteousness. His one Word is holiness. His one undying call to His people is love.\n\nAs the ever-faithful Groom, God remains. Even as His anger burns over the unfaithfulness of His bride, He forgives her. He provides for her. He gives her a fresh start. And in His severe mercy, He even withholds good things from her so that she might return to Him. While Israel hedges its bets on other gods, the Groom has all His focus on His one, true love.\n\nMaybe you don’t need me to spell it out for you today, but in case you do, hear this: you are His one, true love. Wherever you are, whatever you’ve done, whatever anyone else thinks of you, and however long it’s been since the last time you called Him your Groom—He hasn’t changed, and neither has His love for you. \n\n“But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us!” -Romans 5:8\n\n",

Pushing hard against a plow through air. Carefully planting seeds of air. Sweat beading down as you pull weeds from the air. No matter how determined and sincere the Israelites might have been in their efforts, they were applied to an absolutely immovable force: the wind, a force of nature. \n\nAll those miracles right in front of their faces, day after day, and still they were crouching out back, hammering little bits of metal together to fashion some other god to worship. It’s as if they were eager to put themselves in harm’s way, intentionally hunting down ways to insult and abandon the One who had loved and cared for and rescued them time after time. Israel was “a wild donkey wandering alone” (Hosea 8:9). They were a ridiculous people, trying to sow the wind.\n\nIn reality, we’re not so different from the Israelites. \n\nFear and pain and loss surround us. They threaten to rip out our hearts and swallow us whole. Daily we’re tempted to rely on our most sincere plans, determined to live out of our own strength. We strive hard to pile up some measure of security in an unstable world. Whether it’s on the job or in our relationships, we labor at the plow, striving to produce something—anything—that will prove our significance.\n\nWe avoid. We manipulate. We shop. We control. We produce. We sow the wind. We hope, but we hope in the wrong things. \n\nBut “this is what the Sovereign LORD, the Holy One of Israel, says: ‘In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength, but you would have none of it’” (Isaiah 30:15). The Israelites were sinners, just like me and you. But, praise the Lord, Jesus came for wind-sowers like us (Mark 2:17).\n\nYes, life is painfully hard and the giants in the land are real. We are not enough for any of it, but He is. He offers us rest from our endless plowing. He offers us Himself. \n\nOur wrestling and questioning may never end. Sin will continually call us back to our self-sufficient wandering. But when we turn to God and repent, we exchange our demands of Him for trust in Him. When we recall His faithfulness, we’ll see we can put down our idol-making hammers and put all our faith in Him. And faith in Him is never in vain. \n\n",

I can’t put words to it exactly, but I knew it the first time I set foot in that room: it was home.\n\nThe intangible quality of feeling “at home” is as hard to replicate as it is to describe, but it is nonetheless deeply real—so real that we spend our lives trying to find it, create it, hang on to it. That’s why I can’t bear to change the color of our green paint-over-panel dining room walls. I want it to always feel the way it did the day I stood in the doorway and cried because I knew I was home.\n\nHosea chapter 9 is about home, but not the warm, fuzzy feeling I get when I walk into my green dining room at the end of a long day. Israel had forfeited all opportunities for true joy in their lives, in their families, and in their homes. Their blatant and persistent sin meant they were no longer welcome in God’s presence, not until they returned with repentant hearts.\n\nBut Israel was not interested in repentance. Instead, they settled into their sin, becoming at home in their shame. Listen to the sadness in the Lord’s description of their turning away from Him and unto their false loves:\n\nI discovered Israel\nlike grapes in the wilderness.\nI saw your fathers\nlike the first fruit of the fig tree in its first season.\nBut they went to Baal-peor,\nconsecrated themselves to Shame,\nand became detestable,\nlike the thing they loved.\n-Hosea 9:10\n\nGod’s people were called to be holy—set apart for Him alone. But they instead set themselves apart for Shame, the very opposite of their holy, just, and loving Father. What choice did He have but to kick them out of His house?\n\nI will drive them from My house\nbecause of their evil, wicked actions.\nI will no longer love them…\n-Hosea 9:15\n\nAnd that’s where the story would end without the gospel—with me, you, and Israel, sitting on the curb next to a heap of our idols, none of them able to save us or give us a forever home. There we would stay, bound to our shame and humiliation.\n\nShame is not the same as repentance, nor is humiliation the same as humility. It is not enough to be aware of our sin, wallowing in our brokenness. We must (and we may!) repent and return to our holy, gracious God.\n\nPraise the Lord, He loves even the wanderers. He seeks us out and beckons us home by the perfect sacrifice of His Son, Jesus. The Holy One invites us to exchange our worship of impotent idols for worship of Him, the only living God. He washes us of our guilt, breaks our chains of sin and shame, and binds us to Himself. Thanks be to God, we “who were far away have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah” (Ephesians 2:13).\n\nIn Christ, we are at home. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Hosea 10:1-15, Matthew 11:28, Psalm 25:12-22\n\nThere are some passages of Scripture that are really hard to read because they don’t tell us pleasant things. This passage in Hosea is one of them; it talks to us about sin and about its undeniable consequences.\n\nI like it best when I can imagine Jesus patting me on the shoulder, saying, “Well done, good and faithful servant” (Matthew 25:23). But instead of patting me on the back, Hosea 10 kicks me in the pants.\n\nWhy would God say all this to us? Why can’t we skip over the nasty parts and hear about something nice instead?\n\nThe truth is, we cannot fully understand the gospel without this very real and difficult realization of sin. The gospel isn’t a “skip over the difficult stuff” message. It’s the answer to an ugly, deeply rooted problem in our hearts. On their own, our hearts aren’t naturally inclined to seek the Lord and do what’s right.\n\nWe may like to claim a kind of made-up righteousness of our own, but those are “mere words” and “false oaths” (Hosea 10:4). In truth, apart from God’s bountiful grace, we are like Israel. Our actions reveal what we really believe, that “we do not fear the Lᴏʀᴅ” (v. 3). That’s frightening, because Hosea tells us where all this leads: shame, judgment, and war. \n\nBut even in this passage about the darkness of sin, God shines a light for us. When God calls us to “sow righteousness” (v. 12), He’s not simply commanding us—He’s also beckoning to us. God is throwing a rope down into the well to pull us up out of the darkness and muck of our sin. \n\nFrom the deep pit of our own destruction and despair, we hear a steady, loving voice calling even now: \n\n“Sow righteousness for yourselves and reap faithful love; break up your unplowed ground. It is time to seek the Lᴏʀᴅ until he comes and sends righteousness on you like the rain. . .  Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Hosea 10:12; Matthew 11:28).\n\nHosea is a book about God’s wooing of an undeserving people. While the reality of our sin may make us want to run from God, the reminder that He desires good for us, not destruction, draws us close. Difficult passages like this remind us that God longs for our wandering hearts to return to Him and receive His cleansing grace. \n\nLet’s not wallow in our shame, but instead run with abandon back to our loving Father. As we do, He will continue to pursue us as He always has, to rescue us from even the deepest darkness of our hearts.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Hosea 11:1-12, John 6:32-40, Matthew 23:37\n\nThe books had gathered dust in the corner of the room for too long, and I was finally putting them in their rightful place on the hallway shelf. I brushed off each one, shaking out the pages as dust particles danced in the sunlight. That’s how I found it—a torn strip of paper sticking out of the top of an old paperback. The words were written in crayon, in my handwriting: Mama, we’re always in the family, right? \n\nAs soon as I saw it I remembered. It was about two years ago, and all three of our children had become adorably addicted to affirmation. When they got into trouble, or sometimes just because, they would ask the question again. I’d written it down so I’d remember.\n\n“Mama, we’re always in the family, right?” Yes, of course, we’d say. You will always, always be part of this family. \n\nThey haven’t asked the question lately, now that I think of it. I hope this means they’re learning what it means to be a beloved child. \n\nWe’ve come a long way in the book of Hosea. We’ve seen Israel struggle to believe that God is who He says He is. We’ve seen them struggle to repent and obey. And while the whole book makes us ache with recognition of our own sin, these verses at the start of chapter 11 have to be among the most heartbreaking. \n\nWhen Israel was a child, I loved him,\nand out of Egypt I called My son.\nThe more they called them,\nthe more they departed from Me.\nThey kept sacrificing to the Baals\nand burning offerings to idols.\nIt was I who taught Ephraim to walk,\ntaking them in My arms,\nbut they never knew that I healed them.\n-Hosea 11:1-3\n\nGod had been with Israel from the beginning—loving them, providing for them, healing them, leading them “with ropes of love” (v. 4). He was faithfully their Father, but they had forgotten what it meant to be His beloved children. \n\nIt’s not hard to imagine ourselves in Israel’s shoes. Those shoes are where we live. We forget. We are unfaithful. We ignore the hand who heals us. But our sin is not the headline here. The headline is God’s faithfulness. \n\n“How can I give you up?” He asked His children, while they continued to wander in their idolatry (Hosea 11:8). Jesus echoed God the Father’s heart in the Gospel of John: “Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never cast out… This is the will of Him who sent Me: that I should lose none of those He has given Me” (John 6:37, 39). \n\nGod’s people scatter in their sin, yet Christ will lose none—not a single one. I am not the exception to that rule. Neither are you. \n\nIt’s true that we are Israel-caliber sinners. We get lost, wandering through the wilderness of our idolatry. But even when we’re lost, He never loses us. The Lion of Judah will roar as necessary, and His children will return to Him, trembling (Hosea 11:10). Trembling, but at home. \n\nChild of the Father, receive this affirmation today from God’s Word. The One who was with you in the beginning, who has raised you up as His beloved child, will not forsake you now. The sacrifice of His Son has covered your sin, secured your standing, and sealed your hope (Col. 1:14, Rom. 5:17, 1 Pet. 1:3-4). \n\nWith Jesus as your Redeemer, you are always in the family.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nText: Hosea 12:1-14, Psalm 135:13, Isaiah 63:11-14\n\nI am a recent and reticent convert to hiking. Moving from the flat Midwest to a state of unending mountains, there is a certain peer pressure to become a more outdoorsy girl—the type who likes to hike. The problem is that hiking sounds wonderful to me in theory, but the reality of slowly trudging up and up and up is not always as fun.\n\nSo a couple hours into a spontaneous hike with my husband, I was ready to be done. Tired, hungry, and lost, it felt like we were getting nowhere and only increasing our chances of being eaten by a bear. Growing “hangrier” by the minute, I convinced my husband—at this point, probably more afraid of being eaten by me rather than a bear—to head back. \n\nAbout 50 feet back down the worn path, a woman came walking in the direction we had just abandoned.\n\nThis woman had hiked these woods before and she knew the mountaintop was just out of sight, beyond the ridge. She assured us the view from there was absolutely breathtaking and worth every inch of hiking heartache. How could we give up now knowing we were so close? \n\nFeeling a bit foolish, we did a 180-degree about-face, and with renewed hope in our step, we ascended to a clearing. Sitting in silence, staring out at mountains for miles, I realized what we would’ve missed if that woman had not encouraged us to keep going.\n\nIn our walk with God, it can be just as easy to get distracted, tired, and lost along the way. \n\nDo you ever feel like you’ve drifted too far from God to ever come back? Maybe you’re lost in the forest and don’t know just how close the mountaintop really is.\n\nThe book of Hosea reminds us that even when we are unfaithful, God is faithful. Even when we’ve given up, God pursues us. Our God called Hosea to take up a prostitute as his wife and be relentlessly compassionate to her. This demonstrated God’s character and just how much He loved wayward Israel—how He loves us, too, rebellious sinners though we are.\n\nGod declares loud and clear that there is nothing you can do to lose the Father’s love (Romans 8:31-39). \n\nIt can be difficult for us to really grasp the unfailing love of God because it seems so counterintuitive to the way we operate out of our humanity. When we’re hurt, our instinct is often to hurt someone in return or withdraw our love altogether. When people disappoint us time and again, we start to give up on them. To think we can hurt and disappoint God endlessly, yet He still draws near to us, is unfathomable! \n\nOur Lord isn’t some begrudging judge, waiting for us to shape up on our own. He comes to rescue us, helping us turn back to Him (Hosea 12:6). He is the loving Father, running unashamedly toward His prodigal child (Luke 15:20). He is the Good Shepherd who goes off in search of just one lost sheep (Luke 15:4).\n\nSometimes the climb is tedious and disheartening and downright painful. In those moments it’s tempting to give up and turn away. But what we might not be able to see through the trees is the most magnificent view up ahead: our gracious Father, extending His arms and calling us home.  \n\n",

They should know better.\n\nThese people we’re reading about—the ones who “continue to sin” and kiss golden calves (Hosea 13:2)—are God’s people. The Chosen Ones. The ones He brought out of slavery in Egypt and provided for in crazy, miraculous ways. The ones He has been calling to Himself for whole chapters and books of the Bible, year after year, generation after generation. \n\nStill, thirteen chapters into the book of Hosea, no clanging cymbal or shockingly graphic simile is enough to shake Israel out of their sin and cause them to turn and repent. \n\nGod gave Israel food and water in the wilderness, but just as soon as they were satisfied, they forgot why they needed Him in the first place (Hosea 13:6). God is angry with Israel. Shoot, by this point, I’m angry with Israel.\n\nBut Ephraim isn’t the only chaff swirling around on the threshing floor (v. 3).\n\nThat’s me, too, Lord. Isn’t it?\n\nAnd so, our frustration with the Chosen People for being so maddeningly unfaithful to their Helper, turns inward. Their “He’ll be here when we need Him” attitude—putting God in a box on a shelf in case of emergency—sounds disquietingly familiar. \n\nEven waist deep into the book of Hosea, we may find we’re still not giving God the place He deserves in our lives—not up high on some shelf in a box, but on our door frames and at our tables and on our tongues (Deuteronomy 6:6-9). We belong in relationship with Him.\n\nWe may also realize that, like Ephraim, we sometimes talk about God’s grace like it’s a get-out-of-jail-free card (Romans 6:15). We can think of His anger as some kind of scare tactic, where we keep our heads down and toe the line. That might have worked for another generation, but it doesn’t really intimidate us anymore.\n\nBut God still knows us, even as we wander in the wilderness of our sin. He wants our hearts back. So He reminds us, “you know no God but Me, and no Savior exists besides Me” (Hosea 13:4). Amen?\n\nWe are broken, but He is faithful. We are rebellious, but He pursues. We stray. We become prideful and forget who He is. But our change doesn’t change Him. He still wants us back. And He comes for us. Oh, that we would always be amazed by His all-sufficient grace. \n\nWe are more unfaithful than we ever dared believe, but the God of Israel—and of our hearts—is far more faithful than we ever dared hope. Let’s go before our holy God today to thank Him for not giving up on us, even in our darkest moments.\n\n",

I’m a slave to affection, to being loved, to gaining approval. I am an apostate, abandoning my faith and refusing to believe the gospel’s fullness for my life and heart. I buy my way into the affections of others by being winsome, being faithful, being silent, being whatever they need in that moment. \n\nI make a mockery of it—of the extravagant act of mercy the Son of God made on my behalf—every time I go on sinning so that grace may abound (Romans 6:1). I play hard to get, while at the same time longing to be caught in His infinite love and grace. I know the Truth in my head and struggle to wrestle it into my heart. \n\nLike Gomer, what I fail to see is I am already caught. I’m already the bride of the King of the universe, and I bear His name (Isaiah 54:5). I twist myself to repent of my apostasy, yet God says He alone will heal it (Hosea 14:4). He doesn’t just undo my sin; He heals it because I cannot.\n\nHe loves us freely, without cost, without money:\n\n“Come, everyone who thirsts,\ncome to the waters;\nand he who has no money,\ncome, buy and eat!\nCome, buy wine and milk\nwithout money and without price.\nWhy do you spend your money for that which is not bread,\nand your labor for that which does not satisfy?\nListen diligently to me, and eat what is good,\nand delight yourselves in rich food.”\n-Isaiah 55:1-2\n\nGod’s love is wholly distinct and different from ours. God is love, while Hosea can only give love. Love is who God is (1 John 4:8). He cannot help but love fully, without cost to those He loves, save one: His Son.\n\nThere is nothing that can be done to earn God’s love; this is the primary message of the book of Hosea. In the face of adultery, abandonment, idolatry, deceitfulness—His love remains, without cost, without money. He remains and He loves us freely. \n\nAs you finish reading the book of Hosea, the illustration of God’s extravagant love and our constant rebellion, lift up your eyes from your sin. See your God, your Maker, your Groom in the fullness of who He is and what He has done. Stop twisting yourself to win His affection, and stop trying to heal your own rebellious heart. He has already chosen you—yes, you—to be His bride. \n\nBe His bride. Be healed. Be loved, Beloved. \n\n“I trust in God’s faithful love forever and ever. I will praise You forever for what You have done. In the presence of Your faithful people, I will put my hope in Your name, for it is good.”\n- Psalm 52:8-9\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Joel 1:1-14, Isaiah 17:10-11, Acts 2:17-21\n\nHave you ever done something that was honestly deplorable, something you felt desperate to take back as soon as it was done? Even the memory of it can grind you down and make your fingers ache with regret. Shakespeare calls this “an expense of spirit in a waste of shame.”\n\nThe Minor Prophets show us the result of expending our energy to pursue sin: a locust-eaten wasteland of emptiness and shame. Joel’s assessment of sin is bleak: “Indeed, human joy has dried up” (Joel 1:12). It’s a prophecy similar to that of the other prophets. In a nutshell, he’s saying: “you have forgotten the God of your salvation”—repent and return (Isaiah 17:10).\n\nBut instead of just handing it to us in a nutshell, God shows us in sobering terms the plagues, wrath, and judgment that come from our sin. It is utterly devastating. When I read these words I know deep in my bones I can’t shoulder the weight of such miserable punishment. I can’t take my sins back. \n\nIgor Stravinksy devastatingly said, “Sins cannot be undone, only forgiven.” He’s right. We can’t unsay and undo the shameful things we’ve done. But the minor prophets give us real hope. The judgment for our sins is massive, but that is precisely the judgment Jesus paid on our behalf.\n\nGod the Father levies judgment against us because of our sin, and then takes that punishment on His own shoulders in the person of Christ. The tsunami of judgment that reared up and threatened to obliterate us splashes harmlessly back into the ocean because of Christ Jesus.\n\nWhen we read prophecy, it’s important to ask ourselves, What did it mean to them then? and What does it mean for us now? Joel was preaching a specific message to Israel in the midst of a locust crisis, and he is also preaching to us in the midst of our own crises, today. But in this case, his message is really the same: repent and return to your first love.\n\nThen and now, God is in a relationship with His people, censuring our sins with judgment, calling us to repentance, and extending His forgiveness. He is actively doing it all, all the time. We can respond by crying out to Him with deep thankfulness. \n\nLord, we cry out to you. Forgive us, and teach us to forgive.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Joel 1:15-20, Joel 2:1-11, Psalm 43:4, Romans 10:13\n\nYou’re probably tired of hearing about the locusts. Welcome to the club.\n\nWell, I’m definitely not interested in talking about “cicadas,” a term which, until today, I thought was Southern slang for the locusts we read about in Joel chapter 1: “What the devouring locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten…” (v. 4). For the record, they’re not the same. But they’re still creepy and crawly, and although I’m probably hurting a scientist’s feelings right now, they’re the same in my book.\n\nNot long ago, the 13-year cicadas took over our city, which is why I can say for certain that the worst part about these little pests is the swarming noise. And while we’ve moved on in today’s Scripture passage without mention of locusts, that doesn’t mean they aren’t there. We’ve just needed to focus on other things Joel tells us will signal the day of the Lord—and it’s quite a list. Compared to food shortages and moaning cattle, the locusts are nothing.\n\nThat’s what I was beginning to think a few week’s into our recent cicada invasion: Maybe things weren’t so bad! In fact, the swarming sounds were sometimes soothing, like white noise, compared to newer frustrations like recent headlines, car repairs, and dental surgeries. Then, just when I was beginning to consider the cicadas old news, someone sent a mass email to our neighborhood with the subject line, “High-Pitched ‘Whirring’ Noise Throughout Neighborhood.” It read:\n\nDoes anyone know where the noise throughout the neighborhood over the past few days has been coming from? It’s loud over here! Hoping it will cease in the near future, but just wondered if anyone else is aware of the source?\n\nI’m not sure how our neighbor had successfully avoided them for weeks. But as I recalled my own miserable first encounter with the swarming bugs, I felt the urge to send her a sympathy casserole. \n\nWith the ever-increasing list of destruction headed our way in Joel, I think we, too, need a reminder of exactly how bad things actually are. Sin is real, and it is devastating. \n\nSomething I’ve learned about the locusts in Joel, versus the cicadas of my own experience: their swarming results from a collective desperation to be fed, and it is extremely damaging to crops in their path. The hungrier they get, the louder they become.\n\nIsn’t it the same for us? We are willing to destroy almost anything in the name of satisfaction. We are are willing to worship almost anything for a promise of fulfillment. Sin rages, and we continue to turn up the volume. \n\nWe cannot be counted on to stop and listen on our own, which is why it’s so beautiful that, above all the terrible noise we’ve grown accustomed to, God still makes Himself heard.\n\n“The Lord makes his voice heard\nin the presence of his army.\nHis camp is very large;\nthose who carry out his command are powerful.\nIndeed, the day of the Lord is terrible and dreadful—\nwho can endure it?”\n-Joel 2:11\n\nHe doesn’t just make His voice loud as the day of judgment approaches. He makes sure it’s heard by those who love Him, and beckons to those who don’t yet know the sound of His voice. Upon hearing Him, may our hearts respond in love and in praise, echoing the sentiment of the psalmist:\n\nThen I will come to the altar of God,\nto God, my greatest joy.\nI will praise you with the lyre,\nGod, my God.\n-Psalm 43:4\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nScripture Reading: Joel 2:12-17, Zephaniah 1:7, Romans 5:18-21\n\n“Repent and believe.” \n\nThese are the words Christ uses in the Gospel of Mark to begin His earthly ministry (Mark 1:15). But isn’t it funny how quickly we skate past that first part? Believing is beautiful, but repentance is less glamorous. Yet, right out of the gate, Jesus’ ministry began with a call for us to repent of our sin and believe He came to save us.\n\nIf we skip repentance, what do we believe He saves us from?\n\nI spent thirty years hearing the story of the prodigal son one way: a young foolish son squandering his inheritance, only to crawl back home when he had nowhere else to turn. To me, the story was always more about the father. I assumed the lesson here was that I should be as forgiving of foolish people as he was. Years passed, and now when I read that same story, I realize I’m not the father in this scenario. I’m the young fool. The story is as much about repentance as it is about forgiveness. \n\nScripture tells us the son came to his senses. He found clear eyes to look around and see the mess he’d made, then delivered a simple yet profound confession and repentance to his father: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I’m no longer worthy to be called your son” (Luke 15:21).\n\nRepentance wasn’t easy. The son wasn’t even sure if his father would take him back. But the father received him with open arms as a beloved son.\n\nIf Christ calls us to repent and believe, let’s not skip the first step. In doing so, we miss the fullness of the gospel. Let’s listen closely and hear the call to repentance spoken by the prophet Joel on behalf of God Himself:\n\n“Even now—this is the Lᴏʀᴅ’ꜱ declaration—turn to me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning. Tear your hearts, not just your clothes, and return to the Lᴏʀᴅ your God. For he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in faithful love, and he relents in sending disaster.” -Joel 2:12-13\n\nLet’s rend our hearts, like the prophet Joel said. But let’s do so with the confidence that we are returning to a Father who will receive us with open arms and forgive us. He will rejoice over us with singing” (Zephaniah 3:17). As my pastor sometimes says, when our repentance is at its deepest, the joy of our salvation is at its highest.  \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Joel 2:18-32, Zechariah 10:6, 1 Thessalonians 5:2\n\nIt feels like I am always waiting for the Holy Spirit to move, and I have grown weary in my waiting, angry with my unmet expectations of Him. I have distrusted Him and come to believe He has poured out Himself on every son and daughter but me. \n\nFor many years I believed the Spirit was a second blessing, the first being salvation alone through faith alone, and the second coming only through the laying on of hands and impartation of the gift. But when I began to read my Bible I began to see the gift of the Holy Spirit was not a second blessing as much as a coupled blessing: my salvation came with a built-in helper and comforter and teacher, just as Jesus promised it would (John 14:15-31). \n\nMy stumbling block then, it seemed, was struggling to believe this and live as though it were true—to live as though the Spirit Jesus said He would send had indeed come and lived within me, empowering me to bear His fruit, speak His truth, live in His fullness. Because I did not believe the Spirit came with my salvation, I had spun my wheels for years waiting for something. But what? More? Some evidence that I was a true believer? \n\nI believed I was not enough of anything for the Lord of the universe to condescend to me and give me gifts. I had read Joel 2:29 and the quoting of it in Acts, but had never noticed the words, “Even on my male and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit” (Acts 2:18).\n\nEven on.  \n\nThose two small words began to shift something in my belief about my salvation and story. God, the Creator of all, who came in the form of Jesus to earth, and left His Spirit to lead His children into all truth, had not omitted the male and female servants from the gift. He had not passed over the lowliest and poorest. He did not have levels of Christians or levels of the Spirit to give to those Christians, because the ground before the cross of Christ was level. \n\nJesus is not merely a respecter of persons but a hunter of faith. Faith is the only prerequisite for the gift of the Spirit. Faith alone, and nothing else. \n\nI know there are many views on the role of the Holy Spirit, and maybe you’ve felt confused by what you’ve heard. Today, if you’re wringing your hands and waiting, hoping and praying He won’t pass you over, I want to assure you that, if you are His child, He has not passed you over. He has given His Spirit to even the male and female servants, everyone who belongs to the household of God—no matter how long or short your walk of faith has been. \n\nIf you have trusted in the work of Christ to save you, the Holy Spirit is the seal of God upon you, helping and comforting you, strengthening and encouraging you, and empowering you for the work of God. He is the seal that was promised to the all the children of God, and if you are God’s, you have been given the seal, the guarantee, of redemption. Therefore, we need not fear, but rejoice and be glad. For the Lord has done astonishing things (Joel 2:21); He has come to rescue the souls of even you, and even me.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Israel Blessed",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Joel 3:1-21, Isaiah 33:20-22, Jeremiah 33:1-11\n\nWhenever we witness injustice, or experience injustice ourselves, it feels as if vindication cannot come quickly enough. Whether it’s a friend who suffers character assassination, a neighbor who is victimized by crime, or children who are targeted by war—all of these injustices create a deep sense of urgency. We pine for justice, for God to make things right again, and in the meantime, every passing moment can feel like an eternal delay. \n\nThis is one of the most gut-wrenching challenges of being a human in a broken world. Jesus will come back one day, but that day is not here yet. And until then, we must wait for justice with all the agony of a woman in labor. \n\nThis agony is one the Israelites knew well. Joel 3 catalogs a long list of unspeakable suffering: young boys traded for prostitutes; young girls sold for wine; a people scattered from home and subjected to the torment of their enemies. Without a doubt, Israel longed for the day of restoration, the day when God would intervene on behalf of His people and bring an end to their misery. Surely there were days when they wondered if God’s justice would ever come.\n\nBut Joel 3 is the Lord’s response to Israel’s questions and longing: justice is indeed coming. One day, it will come like a roaring lion. All will be made well again. God’s people will be restored. Vengeance will be swift. “Shall I leave [my people’s] innocent blood unavenged? No, I will not,” He proclaims ( Joel 3:21). Because the Lord is, and always will be, a refuge for His people.\n\nThis is the promise of Joel, but it is also the promise of eternity. In Joel we see the character of God and the arc of human history, which guarantees two things:\n\nFirst, God’s justice is coming. Throughout Scripture, God promises that justice is coming. Sometimes the wait is long, but the promise is sure because we can trust the Promiser. As Christians, we bear witness to God’s in-breaking justice when we advocate for justice in the world, but on those days when evil seems triumphant and justice escapes us, we can have confidence that this is not the end of the story. We do not have to grow cynical or despair, because hope will have the final word.\n\nAnd second, God’s restoration is radical. It would be easy to read Joel as a story of two sides: God’s people versus the world. Throughout this chapter, God condemns “the nations” (meaning everyone who is not Israel), and He promises their demise. Destruction would seem to be their fate.\n\nBut if we zoom out and consider God’s heart for the nations, we realize this is not a story of “us versus them,” or “the good guys versus the bad guys.” In Isaiah 49:6, God tells Israel, “I will make you as a light for the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.” In other words, God intends restoration for Israel, but He intends restoration for their oppressors as well.\n\nThis truth is radical, because it means God’s vision of restoration is much bigger than us and our individual injustices. While God promises vindication for the hurting, He desires restoration for all. \n\nThat is both the promise and the character of God. We can trust His justice and live in the hope of it, but His character also calls us into a vision of restoration much greater than ourselves. God’s plan of restoration—the good news of Jesus Christ—is so radical that it even lays claim to our enemies. Without a doubt, God intends to restore us, but He also intends to restore the world.  \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Amos 1:1-15, Amos 2:1-16, Psalm 33:13-22, Isaiah 42:10-13\n\nI have a kid who causes me to say things I never imagined myself saying. I wear myself out shouting unheeded warnings like, “Don’t make new friends in the men’s bathroom! Never ride on a bicycle without a seat! Don’t run your hands on the wooden railings!” Needless to say, when he gets a splinter in his hand, mama is not surprised.\n\nThis leaves me muttering to myself about punitive vs. natural consequences. The punitive variety means I have to impose a punishment, whereas a natural consequence means… if you walk off the edge of a cliff you naturally fall into the gorge below. It feels like a more just outcome when the judgment he needs results in a natural consequence. Then I believe the world is on my side, that he’s getting what he naturally deserves. \n\nIn the first chapter of Amos, the prophet pronounces judgment on somebody else: all the neighbors. Israel knew their neighbors were doing wrong, but did they listen? No, and now they were all going to get their just desserts. Sure, it was a pity, but there you have it: bad people getting in trouble for doing bad things.\n\nMaybe they felt relieved, because this prophecy begins with a judgment of all their neighbors. Finally! They’ll get what they deserve. Our God is going to send fire and break down their gates. I mean, it’s a shame, and we feel bad for them. But better them than us.\n\nBut in the second chapter of Amos, God turns His wrath toward His own people. One by one, He lists the regions of judgment: Judah, Israel, Nazareth. Suddenly, both empathy and Schadenfreude, the feeling of happiness over another’s misfortune, are out the window.\n\nThe judgment is crushing, and of course, much deserved. It is tempting, seeing God’s judgment against sin, to howl in despair. Wait—us, too, Lord? And, if judgment were the end of the story, there wouldn’t be much else to do.\n\nBut the darker it gets, the bigger the cross appears. The words of judgment Amos delivered were designed to drive us to the end of ourselves, to realize that we are just like the nations—just like our neighbors, just like naughty little boys—justly deserving God’s wrath. But this should not drive us to despair, but to Christ.\n\nTake hope, and “look, the Lord keeps his eye on those who fear him—those who depend on his faithful love” (Psalm 33:18). It is His faithful love we must look to, not ourselves. It is neither our own faithfulness, nor our own miserable failures that have the final word. All things are designed to drive us Christ-ward.\n\nMay your faithful love rest on us, Lord,\nfor we put our hope in you.\n-Psalm 33:22\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Amos 3:1-15, Amos 4:1-13, Psalm 65:5-8, Romans 11:1-6\n\nThe summer camp where I worked in college enforced a strict “no sweets” rule. The rule’s purpose was to prevent ants, attracted to the sugar, from invading our camp and overrunning our cabins. Therefore, if your mom mailed you a Tupperware container of brownies during the week, you had to abstain from eating them until Saturday, our day off. This posed a challenge to my demanding sweet tooth.\n\nOne afternoon, a package of brownies was delivered to a fellow camp counselor. A few of us gathered around the forbidden Tupperware, looking at it longingly. \n\n“I’m eating one,” I finally said, defiantly. I could not deny my sweet tooth for one more moment and, I reasoned, no one would know. What harm could it do? But just as I was raising the brownie to my mouth, the camp director—our boss—walked by. I paused.\n\n“You gonna eat that?” he asked.\n\nHe won’t do anything to me, I thought. I’m a great counselor. I’m responsible. He likes me. I’m above the rules. \n\nWith this confidence, I took a bite. Right in front of the camp director. Guess who had to spend her Saturday morning power-washing the bathroom floors?\n\nMy attitude in front of my camp director that day is not unlike the attitude of Israel we see described in Amos 3 and 4. Israel was prosperous during this time. They were victorious in their military pursuits and had grown wealthy, acquiring “great houses… inlaid with ivory” (Amos 3:15). But instead of using their wealth and status to do good, they oppressed the poor and crushed the needy (Amos 4:1), directly defying the law that enforced caring for the vulnerable (Deuteronomy 15:7). \n\nIsrael had let their status go to their heads and had begun to consider themselves above the rules. As a result, they slid deeper and deeper into sin. They needed to repent. They needed to change their behavior, and most of all, they needed to remember who God was. \n\nThe biggest pitfall when considering yourself above the rules is that you also begin to consider yourself above the rule-maker. And if you are above the rule-maker, you will naturally tend toward acts of defiance, for there is no longer anyone to defy. This is why I chomped on a forbidden brownie right in front of my camp director that summer. I incurred punishment as a reminder of who was in charge.\n\nIsrael would do the same. \n\nAmos reminds them in these chapters who their rule-maker is. No matter how successful Israel’s military pursuits had been, no matter how prosperous they had become, God still sat on His throne, and “the God of Armies is his name” (Amos 3:13). \n\nI often grow comfortable in my position as God’s child, adopted by the blood of Christ. But this does not set me above the rules; this sets me directly beneath the authority of Jesus, the King of kings. It is now His rule that I follow and not my own. \n\nLet’s praise the God of Armies today. He is the one “who forms the mountains, who creates the wind, and who reveals his thoughts to mankind, who turns dawn to darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth” (Amos 4:13). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Amos 5:1-27, Micah 6:8, Philippians 4:8-9\n\nI am a first-born, Type-double-A achiever, fluent in the languages of performance and gold stars. Grace, on the other hand, consistently boggles my mind.  \n\nI can think back to one such moment several years ago. My husband was on staff at a small church. I did everything I could to partner with him in the ministry that became the functional nucleus of our existence. Ministry is time-consuming and, at times, gut-wrenching. And while my husband seemed to feel a tinge of external pressure, I faced a daily temptation to spontaneously combust. That’s what happens when you try to earn something that has already been freely given; things become volatile in a hurry. \n\nI was serving my guts out for all the wrong reasons, trying to earn God’s favor through church attendance and program planning. I was living for the gold stars that I hoped existed on a cosmic sticker chart in heaven. It’s not that anything I was doing was “wrong” or “bad.” It was just an outflow of a heart tied up in self-inflicted knots. The carrot that was always in front of me was the false gospel of good deeds, not the true gospel of Jesus Christ. That experience taught me that false gospels are terrible taskmasters—cruel, demanding, and ultimately hollow. \n\nGod’s people find themselves whipped by such a taskmaster in Amos 5. Instead of seeking the Lord, their hearts chase wildly after everything else. Amos promises destruction in return for their rebellion. God’s people find themselves fallen, forsaken, and on fire (vv. 2,6). And then comes the wailing, mourning, and lamenting (v. 16).\n\nAs dramatic as this sounds, it feels like the same old same old. God’s people turn to idols and He raises up a prophet to yank them back from the brink of judgment. But this time things are different. There is no golden calf, no Asherah poles, no altar set up to honor a pagan god. Instead, God is enraged by their offerings of “good things,” given for all the wrong reasons (Amos 5:21-23).\n\nGod’s people were following the rules. They gathered like He commanded them to (Exodus 12:16). They faithfully brought their offerings, just like their righteous forefathers had (Genesis 8:20, 22:3; Leviticus 1:3). They even held spirited worship services. What gives? \n\nI think back to that season of ministry and know there are no gold stars in heaven. There is only grace. And grace can never, ever be earned. So Amos might as well have been preaching to us because our hearts are not unlike those of the Israelites: our motives are misshapen, our goal is our own glory, and our worship is all wrong. \n\nYet, even as God breathes out judgment upon His people through Amos, He also offers redemption. He calls out to us even now, saying, “Seek me and live!… Seek the Lord and live” (vv. 4,6).\n\nWorship and sacrifice are meant to be an exclamation of God’s goodness toward us, not a means to try to grab more from Him. If we find our hearts tied up in knots, worrying that we  haven’t earned the gift He freely offers, then we must look for the thread of salvation woven into every tapestry of God’s judgment. \n\nIf you are tired and worn out and empty from striving and performing, look once again to Jesus. It’s His love and devotion—not ours—that turn our hearts back toward Him. \n\nSeek Him and live. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Amos 6:1-14, Amos 7:1-17, Psalm 47:1-9, Acts 4:13-20\n\nIt’s hard to read Amos without squirming. \n\nThroughout this short book—chapter 6, in particular—Amos paints a scene of extravagance and wealth. Israel is at the height of its splendor. Riches, comfort, leisure, and affluence are all theirs for the taking. They are privileged to the extreme, a portrait that sounds quite a bit like many countries and cultures we inhabit today.\n\nMistakenly, the Israelites hoarded their opulence as “blessing.” They saw the provision as an end in itself, a gift from God to be indulged. They also drew security from it. They took pride and comfort in being more powerful than the countries around them. They measured success by having more of it than their neighbors. \n\nGod rebuked them for their greed, and in the strongest possible terms, because He viewed blessing quite differently than the Israelites. God did not intend for the Israelites to prosper simply to luxuriate in it. He did not provide them with wealth simply as an assurance of security. And He did not allow them ease of life simply to grow complacent. The blessings of God were never meant to be stored up like grain. In the wake of God’s judgment on Israel’s pride, Amos cried out, “Lord God, please forgive!” (7:2). \n\nThousands of years later, Amos’s words are as relevant as ever. We continue to live in a world of vast economic disparity. From country to country, and even community to community, the range of prosperity is wide. In some cities, multi-million dollar homes sit within miles of homeless shelters and housing projects, and Christians populate them both. And so, wherever we fall on this spectrum of wealth, Amos challenges us with this question:\n\nWhat are we to do with our blessing? \n\nWhatever the size and the shape of our privilege, how are we to use it? Amos compels us to consider this question, but so does the witness of Christ. Jesus, after all, “did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,” but “took the form of a servant” (Philippians 2:6-7), meaning He leveraged His privilege for others. Jesus denied Himself comfort and set His splendor aside out of love for God and the world. We cannot claim to follow Him without following Him in this also.\n\nJesus’ handling of His own privilege is the standard passed down to us. When we want to know what to do with our blessing, we look to Christ. When we enjoy success, gain, or even a leg up, we are never meant to hoard it for ourselves. Rather, as followers of Jesus, we are meant to leverage our blessing for others, just as He did for us.\n\nThis is radical. Even in the Church, this is radical. When blessing comes our way, it’s easy to receive it as a personal reward for faithfulness. Or it’s tempting to store it away for the sake of financial security. Neither response is wrong in itself, but our vision should always be bigger than ourselves. God’s intention for blessing is never individual; He always has a broader blessing in view. \n\nJust as Israel was meant to be a light to the nations, and the Church a light in the world, everything we are given has a greater purpose. May we steward our blessings accordingly.  \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Amos 8:1-14, Amos 9:1-15, Psalm 53:6, Ezekiel 37:25\n\nI live on the west side of a Civil War town in middle Tennessee. Our kitchen windows face the setting sun, the view framed by tall oaks and the distant red barn that sits on a neighboring horse farm. My mornings begin with coffee at the table, as I watch the settled fog lift to show the glory of the day; evenings end with the sun sliding behind the treeline, welcoming the scattering of stars. \n\nBut many summer afternoons, a strong wind comes and chases away the sun, and from the west we’ll see gathering clouds that can only mean one thing: a pop-up storm. Almost without warning, it will rain so hard we can’t see past our fence. The thunder will rock the ground, and lightning threatens to strike closer and closer with every bolt. \n\nWhen I read Amos 8 and 9, I feel the heavy heartbeat of a summer thunderstorm. I can imagine Amos, seeing the clouds gather, trying to warn the people that the storm of God’s judgment is coming and it will not miss them. \n\nAmos shows us a portrait of an angry God we often shy away from as the God of the Old Testament, as if we are any less culpable than the Israelites who repeatedly turned away from Him. This passage is an important reminder that who God is will never change. His hatred of sin, His anger at those who turn against Him—these are the hard mysteries of His glory, the things we have to wrestle through as we fight our way to the New Testament where we find the unfathomable, gracious, merciful gift of Jesus. \n\nBut we have to weather the storms with our ancestors in faith. We have to feel every thunderclap and lightning bolt to understand the power of our God, which makes His great mercy and faithfulness that much more unimaginable, His promises that much more precious.\n\nBecause after all of His promises of judgment, God makes another kind of promise in chapter 9, verse 11: \n\n“In that day I will raise up the booth of David that is fallen, and repair its breaches, and raise up its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old.”\n\nGod promises Israel that they will never be uprooted from the land He has given them. The storm will end—maybe not for these Israelites in their lifetime, and maybe not for us in ours. The brokenness of the world walks in lockstep with the calendar, each day bringing its own grief and reminders that Christ has not yet come again. But as God promised the Israelites at the end of Amos, restoration is coming. We will not be uprooted. We know the rest of the story. We know our pure, holy, and just God could never be content with the evil and brokenness of sin. But it’s His anger toward sin that led to the greatest mercy of all: the gift of His Son Jesus Christ. \n\nWhen those afternoon storms pass, our backyard is left in the humid haze of the setting sun. The world is clean, the earth watered and refreshed. God has not promised us a life free from storms, but He has promised that one day the storms will end. It’s then that we will dwell with Him in perfect peace forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Obadiah 1:1-21, Genesis 27:41-42, Ezekiel 25:12-14\n\nI am reading Obadiah from the front porch swing just before dark. It’s raining, as it has been all afternoon, though from my last glance at the forecast, I would have sworn today would be sunny and warm. That’s the way forecasts work—for weather and politics, finances and medical prognoses. They are guesses, by definition. But I still check the weather each day when I wake, to see if something bright or somber brews beyond the clouds. \n\nWe’ve heard that knowledge is power, so we look to those with more wisdom and experience than us to divvy out the forecasts. We look to them to tell us what to do, how to think, how to prevent, how to plan. And most of them do their honest best to deliver. Even so, not a single soul can keep the rain from falling. \n\nNo meteorologist can predict the path of every storm. No politician has perfect policy. No surgeon can conquer every cancer. No matter how lofty our intellect and noble our cause, none of us is God. \n\nWe know this in our heads, but sometimes—oftentimes—our hearts forget. \n\nThe Minor Prophets in the Old Testament proclaim God’s judgment on many nations, but the tiny book of Obadiah calls out only one—Edom. Edom is the nation descended from Esau, son of Isaac and twin brother of Jacob. And though Edom’s sins were surely many, Obadiah’s prophecy focuses on one sin that seems to be the root of all their others: pride. \n\nYour arrogant heart has deceived you,\nyou who live in clefts of the rock\nin your home on the heights,\nwho say to yourself,\n“Who can bring me down to the ground?” (vv.3-4).\n\nEdom had grown haughty in their position and power. They felt—and acted—untouchable, invincible. And while they indeed held a privileged position among their neighboring nations, they were not beyond the reach of the sovereign Lord of all nations. \n\nThough you seem to soar like an eagle\nand make your nest among the stars,\neven from there I will bring you down.\nThis is the Lord’s declaration (v.4).\n\nHistory, Scripture included, is filled with rulers and nations like Edom who failed to wield their power wisely. King Saul was lauded as a wise and good king at the start of his reign, but he later turned his back on God, endangering his people and losing his throne (1 Samuel 13). King David was beloved by his people, but his moral failure had disastrous consequences and his own son led a rebellion against him (2 Samuel 11). King Herod was so disillusioned by his power that he ordered a massacre of children in his kingdom (Matthew 2:16). \n\nThese examples may feel extreme or distant to our modern sensibilities, but they point to a truth that still stands: There is only one God worthy of our trust, one King worthy of our worship. \n\nThe Lord promises that Edom—and all nations—will get their due. They’d mocked their neighbors in distress; they’d lorded their position of power over others; they’d failed to offer justice and compassion. Perhaps we have, too. Thanks be to God for Jesus, the one who lived a life of justice, compassion, and righteousness in our place, then took the punishment for our injustice, pride, and sin upon Himself. Only in Him can we find the peace others seek in power, policy, health, and wealth. Only He gives the blessing and home our hearts long for. \n\nHumans will fall and plans will fail, but the kingdom will be the Lord’s. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Jonah 1:1-17, Psalm 104:24-26, Matthew 12:38-42\n\nPulling the coarse blanket tighter and rolling over, Jonah sighed as he sank deeper into sleep. The warm dark cabin around him creaked and groaned as the waves outside surged with increasing intensity. The sailors above deck scanned the horizon and glanced anxiously up at a grey sky heavy with the strength of the Lord Almighty. God was coming for Jonah.\n\nThe prophet was running away, but God pursued him like only the Creator and Lord of the sea could: with a furious ocean tempest. Jonah tried to flee from the very presence of the Lord, thinking he could hide if he found an old boat heading in a new direction.\n\nBut God is fierce and awesome in His pursuit. Jonah never had a chance of hiding. Even the inanimate dice the sailors used to cast lots pointed him out as the one running from God (Jonah 1:7). God had called to Jonah, “Get up! Go” (Jonah 1:2), and now all creation seemed to be shouting, “Return!” God uses wind and waves, even dice—everything in creation stands by to obey its Creator. In the face of the deafening storm and sure signs, the sailors feared for their lives, and looked to Jonah with eyes of blame and hands ready to heave-ho. \n\nGod’s pursuit is relentless exactly because He is so loving. He could’ve crushed Jonah under a tremendous sea surge and found another man. Jonah had his chance, and he clearly took the coward’s way out, right? God gave him a clear instruction (something we all long for), and Jonah ran like a frightened child in the other direction. Why didn’t God give up on Jonah?\n\nGod wanted Jonah. Goodness, isn’t that amazing? I sometimes feel like I’m a substandard version of the person who should actually be living my life. And the truth is, I do fall short. I do worry that there is someone who would be a better mother to my kids, wife to my husband, friend to my friends. But despite my imperfections and failings, I am the best mother for my children, wife for my husband, and friend for my friends. God gives specific callings to specific people (Ephesians 2:10). That means God wants me for my particular calling and life.  \n\nWe can’t escape God and His storm gale of purpose. He pursues us with love that is filled with a beautiful intensity unlike anything else we have ever known.\n\n“Where can I go to escape your Spirit?\nWhere can I flee from your presence?\nIf I go up to heaven, you are there;\nif I make my bed in Sheol, you are there.”\n-Psalm 139:7-8\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Jonah 2:1-10, Psalm 88:4-5, Hebrews 4:16\n\nIf you had to choose a ride at Disney World to be stranded on, which would it be?\n\nOf course, the resounding answer is none, but if you really had to pick, would you choose one that didn’t go upside down? Would you pick your favorite? Maybe you’d go with one that at least overlooks a pretty view. My guess is you wouldn’t pick The Haunted Mansion, filled with ghosts and zombies and who-knows-what around the corner—the name speaks for itself.\n\nYet, speaking from experience, I’d give it five out of five stars. I would definitely recommend getting stuck on The Haunted Mansion. Because, here’s the thing: Florida is eleventy-billion degrees every single day of the year. The Haunted Mansion is dark. The seats recline. It is air conditioned. In fact, I think the best nap of my life happened on those plastic seats when the ride shut down unexpectedly. But if you’d told me this before I buckled my seatbelt, I never would have agreed to get on the ride.\n\nI bet if Jonah had known beforehand that he would get swallowed by a fish, he never would have stepped foot on that boat. Many of the places God brings us to are ones we would never choose for ourselves. But that is the point: When we stop trying to find ourselves, we can see that we’ve already been found.\n\nPastor and author A.W. Tozer said, “In every generation, the people who have found God have been those who have come to the end of themselves. Recognizing their hopelessness, they have been ready to throw themselves on the mercy and grace of a forgiving God.”\n\nThis is why Jonah’s prayer is so surprising to us: it doesn’t sound like Jonah. He hasn’t shown interest in obeying God up until this point, and although he didn’t drown, things aren’t looking especially bright for him. But when stripped of the stories he’s told himself, he sees clearly: Death is not the worst-case scenario; life without God is. \n\nThis is what grace and mercy sound like in the face of death:\n\n“Then you raised my life from the Pit, Lord my God!\nAs my life was fading away,\nI remembered the Lord,\nand my prayer came to you,\nto your holy temple” (Jonah 2:6-7).\n\nOf course, we don’t want to walk through storms and sit in darkness and sleep in the underbelly. But what if we remembered these are the places where grace usually meets us? Sometimes grace is messy and dark. Sometimes mercy is painful and scary. God does not need perfect circumstances to bring us closer to Him. In fact, it’s usually the opposite.\n\nLet’s not overlook that Jonah thanks God for raising his life from the pit while he is still in it. May we do the same today, allowing grace to meet us and mercy to surprise us. We can trust that even as we cry out to God in our distress, He is faithful to answer our call (Jonah 2:2). Thanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Jonah 3:1-10, Jeremiah 18:7-10, Nahum 1:2-11\n\nNineveh was the worst.\n\nA chief city in the already brutal and wicked Assyrian empire, Nineveh removed the noses and ears of their prisoners to mark and maim them for life. And like most Mesopotamian civilizations, their culture was immoral and generally terrifying—temple prostitution, child sacrifice, and infanticide. \n\nI love my ears and nose, so I understand why Jonah didn’t want to go.\n\nThese are the people who heard God’s call to repentance. They listened to Jonah and to God. And they repented. They stopped, tore their clothes, rubbed ashes on their faces, and gave up eating. They were desperate to get God’s attention.\n\nGod had mercy on even these most wicked people. They didn’t know they were that wicked until God arrested them in their sin. But this story is only marginally about the repentant Ninevite hearts. Primarily, this is a story about God’s mercy and forgiveness.\n\nGod calls them to repent, and they respond by fasting.\n\nFasting hurts. It is tangible and practical repentance, and repentance must change how we live our lives. We turn from the things that give us false comfort, and only have God. \n\nFor the Ninevites, fasting meant giving up their means of power and energy, and depending only on God for power in a very real way. They humbled themselves publicly and didn’t hold back for pride or fear of what others would think. Even the king—who held an almost god-like status in the culture and had everything to lose—humbled himself, bowing before the one true God. It was a culture-wide repentance, extending from the greatest to the least.\n\nTheir repentance was not chiefly about how sorry they felt, but about casting themselves wholly upon God’s mercy. It wasn’t about what they could bring to the table. Rather, they said, “Who knows? God may turn and relent” (Jonah 3:9). They recognized that repentance is about what God is doing, not what we can do to gain any kind of merit. \n\nMercy is not a matter of merit; it is God’s gift. When we call out earnestly to Him in repentance (Jonah 3:8), He “is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).\n\nEven though Nineveh was awful by any standard, God had mercy on them. This is good news, because the truth is we are all more like the Ninevites than we are like God. I know I am. I don’t gouge eyes out, yet pride, envy, and wrath are always within arm’s reach for me.  \n\n“But I received mercy for this reason, so that in me, the worst of them, Christ Jesus might demonstrate his extraordinary patience as an example to those who would believe in him for eternal life.” -1 Timothy 1:16\n\nThe story of Nineveh’s repentance is about God’s perfect patience, His deep mercy, and His profound forgiveness. Call out earnestly to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Jonah’s Anger",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Jonah 4:1-11, Acts 11:15-18, Romans 5:6-11\n\nThe final chapter of Jonah gives us a unique glimpse into a conversation between God and His prophet. The majority of prophecy depicts the prophets relaying God’s message. Here, we get to see the struggle between the reluctant prophet and a faithful God. I’m almost uncomfortable with Jonah’s level of irreverence, confessing he is angry that God has been merciful. It’s cringe-worthy.\n\nAnd yet, Jonah was not the first, nor would he be the last, to express discontent with God’s mercy toward a wayward people. In fact, Scripture is full of stories like this. The older brother in the parable of the prodigal son is angry at his father for throwing the rebellious sibling a party (Luke 15:11-32). The Pharisees are angry at Jesus for not following the law like they think he should (John 9:13-16). The disciples are concerned when Jesus addresses a Samaritan woman, someone whose ethnicity and gender signified a person to avoid, not converse with (John 4:1-24). \n\nWe like to belong, and we like to decide who doesn’t belong. They deserve God’s mercy. They don’t. They do. They don’t. Maybe this is why I cringe at Jonah’s anger; because I’ve seen that same anger in me. I’ve seen it on a personal level when blessing and favor are poured out on someone’s life whom I don’t feel “deserves” it. I’ve also seen it on a more global level when I generalize an entire people group as “evil” or “lost,” beyond God’s redemption. \n\nThis sin tendency was in Jonah, and it is in me too. \n\nHow quick I am to forget that I was an outsider once! As Romans says, “For while we were still helpless, at the appointed moment, Christ died for the ungodly” (Romans 5:6). I was ungodly—as evil as a Ninevite. It is only because of God’s mercy through His Son Jesus that I am now in the family as an adopted child of God.\n\nI think it’s interesting that God has the last word in the book of Jonah. We don’t know what Jonah’s response was to God’s question, “Should I not care about the great city of Nineveh…?” (Jonah 4:11). But we know what Jonah’s answer should have been. We see it modeled much later in the story, in the book of Acts. \n\nPeter is trying to convince his fellow Jews that Gentiles can indeed follow the way of Christ. He tells the group that he saw the Holy Spirit descend on a group of Gentiles, just as it had descended upon them. When Peter’s audience heard this, Scripture says, “they became silent. Then they glorified God, saying, ‘So God has granted repentance resulting in life even to the Gentiles!’” (Acts 11:18). \n\nPerhaps they fell silent in awe. Perhaps they fell silent in skepticism. We don’t know. What we do know is ultimately, instead of feeling anger toward God, they glorified Him. They rejoiced that His mercy reached further than they had ever fathomed it could. \n\nOh that our response would be the same. That we would never underestimate the breadth and depth of God’s mercy. That we would rejoice every time His mercy blesses someone around us, remembering that it was this same mercy that welcomed us into His family. And that it is only by grace that we remain.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Micah 1:1-16, Micah 2:1-13, Psalm 46:1-11, Hebrews 6:13-20\n\nOur air conditioner broke this week. I’m from the far north, where central air is a foreign thing and window units are turned on maybe thrice a summer. I live in Texas now, though, and while a heater is a thing you could maybe do without, an air conditioner is not optional. My husband called me today and gave me the estimate of a new system and I felt my stomach drop into my pinky toe. \n\nHow much? I asked him. This much, he said. My mind immediately turned to our savings account. Finally, after a year of beginning to accumulate some savings, we were hoping to have enough to repair our foundation or put some equity into the home itself. WelI, I said, there goes that.\n\nA year ago this month we had a colossal financial loss. It was a perfect storm of sudden job loss, multiple moves cross-country to and from high-priced cities, the sale on our house falling through five times before (finally) selling at nearly a $100k loss to us. We hemorrhaged money for nine months until there was nothing left. I felt as physically defeated as I have ever felt, and our bank account actually was. \n\nIn that space, God did not come through with astounding miracles or great hurrahs. He came in quietly, through a sentence from a friend or a glimmer of hope—for months and months and months. I ached, but I began, eventually, to ache toward healing. He began to hem me in, though in an even a greater way than before, so I could learn to rest in His protection and care for me.\n\nAnd with that healing I imagined God would deeply plant the lessons I’d learned in the process, that I would never have to repeat the same struggle to the same degree. Surely, I knew now that God was my provider, my shepherd, my caregiver? And because I knew it, I assumed He would never take the time to prove it to me again.\n\nI sometimes believe we’re alike, God and I. I reason that because my mind changes, His must too. I’m positive He’s scheming a switcheroo, some grande finale where I’ll be the one left on the outside of the fence. I mistakenly believe I’m saved upon my own merits; the things I have learned or the lessons I have accumulated. I begin to believe I bring myself into the fold and am not simply brought in by Him.\n\nBut God, in His goodness, swore by Himself that He’d bring me in (Hebrews 6:13-20). From the get-go and from the start, before the foundations of the earth, before Eve ate the fruit, before the twelve tribes scattered, before the cross of Calvary, He counted me in. He gathered me in, “like sheep in a fold, like a flock in its pasture” (Micah 2:12)—kept, secure, and protected. \n\nSheep can still get hurt in the fold. They can still sprain a leg or trip over a stump. Today I’m reminded of that as I sit directly in front of my oscillating fan and try hard not to think about our savings account. But sheep in the pasture have a Shepherd who is near to them—caring, attentive, and present. I sometimes begin to believe God has ousted me when things are going badly, that I have sinned too grievously or disappointed Him too greatly. But, the God who does not change, brought me in, and there I remain, His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Micah 3:1-12, Micah 4:1-13, Psalm 25:8-9, 1 Corinthians 10:31\n\nThe book of Micah is a cry for justice, with a pattern of rebuke and restoration throughout its chapters. Micah reads as a defense of justice, and a judgment of those in Israel who do not practice it. \n\nMicah chapter 3 begins with a stunning, almost disgusting, rebuke of the powerful leaders, using cannibalistic metaphor to charge them with oppressing the poor. The prophet spares no words, addressing them as those who “hate good and love evil” and “abhor justice and pervert everything that is right” (vv. 2, 9).\n\nIn his book Generous Justice, Tim Keller writes: \n\n“It is the generosity of God, the freeness of his salvation, that lays the foundation for the society of justice for all. Even in the seemingly boring rules and regulations of tabernacle rituals, we see that God cares about the poor, that his laws make provision for the disadvantaged. God’s concern for justice permeated every part of Israel’s life. It should also permeate our lives.”\n\nMicah’s words—and Keller’s—are disquieting because of how easily I see myself in the oppressors. I have lived a fairly fortunate life, physically and monetarily, and it is so natural to continue to live my fortunate life, day to day, without seeing the ways people are oppressed around me and all around the world. And even when those blinders fall off, it’s easy to merely throw money at a good cause or say an earnest prayer. But both can be done without engaging my heart. \n\nThankfully, we can read on to Micah chapter 4, and see that true justice and knowledge comes from the Lord—not from us. We can go to the mountain of God, where “he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his path” (v. 2). \n\nThis is a beautiful passage, full of some of the most well-known images of peace and prosperity found in the whole Old Testament. From a promise that the people of Israel would be able to turn their swords and spears into plowshares, to the picture of sitting peacefully under vines and fig trees, Micah reveals the end result of loving justice and living God’s way. \n\nMicah’s vision of justice is a vision of the restoration of shalom, God’s original design for the world. In his book Not the Way It’s Supposed to Be, Cornelius Platinga describes shalom as a “universal flourishing, wholeness and delight—a rich state of affairs in which natural needs are satisfied and natural gifts fruitfully employed.” This is the world as it ought to be, as God intended it to be. \n\nMicah shows us two very different visions of the world. Chapter 3 shows us the consequences of not pursuing justice, mercy, and loving our neighbors. And then chapter 4 shows us a restored, peaceful world where we walk with God and in His ways.\n\nMy heart longs for the redeemed world Micah describes, for God’s creation to be restored. This longing makes me want to walk in His ways. It leads me to pray He will rewire my stubborn, entitled, fortunate heart toward justice, to ask that He give me His eyes to see the poor and oppressed. With the Lord leading, the pursuit of justice and shalom becomes a daily endeavor, one we pursue with our Creator God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Micah 5:1-15, Psalm 72:1-11, Luke 1:26-33\n\nThe weight of the gospel sunk deep into my bones when I started looking for Jesus on every page of His Word. Sure, He’s in the Gospels. Paul mentions Jesus often in his letters too. I even knew Jesus got the occasional Old Testament shout out in places like Isaiah chapter 9: “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given…” (v. 6).\n\nBut as God graciously grew my understanding of His Word, He also helped me see that the gospel is the thread stitching the entire Bible together. Jesus weaves in and out of every book. He is the point of every chapter and verse. \n\nSuddenly, I saw Jesus at creation when the Godhead declared, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” (Genesis 1:26, emphasis mine).  \n\nI recognized Him at the first Passover (Exodus 12). As the Israelites sprinkled their doorposts with the blood of a spotless lamb, they were acting out the gospel. When the angel of death passed over God’s people because of the blood of that lamb, God was shooting up a beacon of hope throughout history. Jesus’ blood would soon save us from death’s wrath in much the same way. Our sin would be passed over because of Christ’s sacrifice on our behalf. \n\nAs I read about the scarlet cord Rahab the prostitute threw from her window as a sign of deliverance (Joshua 2), I saw the gospel thread there too. For I am a sinner who deserves destruction, yet Christ’s blood is the symbol that I shall be delivered from my enemies and some day live at peace with God’s people in the promised land. Here, in Micah 5, we find a prophet picking up the needle and threading it with the gospel story once again. \n\nWe’ve seen enough kids’ Christmas programs to recognize the significance of Bethlehem. It is the spot on the map where Christ was born in a stable “for there was no place for them in the inn” (Luke 2:7). We’ve probably also seen Jesus painted as a shepherd in a Sunday school classroom or two. There are enough dots here for us to connect and realize that Micah is prophesying about Jesus. But let’s look at Micah’s words again, searching for every fray of that gospel thread. Don’t race past this. The implications are too wonderful: \n\n“But you, O Bethlehem… from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from old, from ancient days… and he shall be their peace.” -Micah 5:2, 5\n\nJesus was always at work to come and rescue us, from the moment He poured the foundations of the earth. Way back in the ancient of days, He was already riding toward us with redemption on His mind. Christ’s sacrifice for the sins of man was always Plan A. No Plan B is necessary. \n\nWhen I worry my sin might make the gospel give way, when I secretly fear I’m the one sinner whose brokenness grace isn’t big enough to cover, I can open God’s Word and trace the gospel thread back to the start. There I find Jesus, the Hero throughout the ages, who always had a plan to win me back, and I see that hope was always on the way. We were never for one nanosecond without the promise of it.\n\n",

Unfortunately, no one relayed this message to my kerchief-wearing, popcorn-selling, Eagle Scout of a little brother.\n\nWith socks to his knees and badges across his chest, he’d proudly hold up his fingers, reciting the Boy Scout motto every night before brushing his teeth. His newfound pack became his identity, and while it didn’t earn him a swarm of girlfriends, it certainly brought the shy boy out of his shell. He threw himself into first aid, emergency preparedness, environmental science, and camping, checking off as many merit badge requirements as possible.\n\nIn Micah 6, that’s exactly what the Israelites were hoping for: a checklist for how to please God. They had failed at manufacturing goodness for themselves, and their idols hadn’t produced any fruit. Assuming the answer was to work harder, they wondered when God would ever be satisfied with what they had to offer.\n\nIsrael wanted to earn their ranking in faith through burnt offerings, year-old calves, rams, and streams of oil, but even these expensive gifts were not an equal trade for righteousness. And the instructions God provided were not what they expected. \n\n“Mankind, he has told you what is good\nand what it is the Lᴏʀᴅ requires of you:\nto act justly,\nto love faithfulness,\nand to walk humbly with your God.”\n-Micah 6:8\n\nUpon hearing these words from the prophet, I bet the Israelites were ready to tie their kerchiefs around their necks and get to work achieving their merit badges with God. But looking at the specific commands, we can guess they became a little confused when they realized everything had already been accomplished. Their assigned tasks were not primarily about their own sacrifice, strength, or anything else the Israelites could offer. They were simply called to mirror the character of God. \n\nInstead of just giving them rules to follow, He pointed forward to the work He’d later accomplish on the cross.\n\n\u2022 We, like Israel, forget that the only merit we have is the blood of the Messiah.\n\u2022 We can only act justly because we have been justified through Christ.\n\u2022 We can only love faithfulness because He defined it for us on the cross.\n\u2022 We can only walk humbly because His footsteps went before us.\n\u2022 We can only be with our God because Christ joined us to Him.\n\nThe only thing left on our to-do list is to worship the God who does not change. May we fear His name alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Micah 7:1-20, Psalm 103:8-9, Romans 6:12-14\n\nBoth my husband and I are mostly unemployed. I’m trying not to be anxious about it. We are here on purpose. We left our jobs so we could have freedom to spend time with our kids and create art together. And we have a lot of ideas, but nothing has panned out yet. As I watch our savings descend further and further from black to red, I try to stay focused on positively creating something new instead of choking with panic and imagining my children begging for food.\n\nWhen we try out a new idea, and it doesn’t yield any results, we feel defeated and isolated. Defeat and isolation are paralyzing emotions we all feel in different ways. One of my smallest sons feels total defeat when he gets shampoo in his eyes, and deep isolation if everyone else has already had a snack without him.\n\nWhether you are looking for a job or a snack, feeling alone can be terrifying. And Micah’s isolation was chilling on both a physical and spiritual level. He actually had real and profound reasons to feel alone. He believed there was no one left, and howled out, “Faithful people have vanished from the land; there is no one upright among the people” (Micah 7:2). He felt defeated and searched for a few good men, but he couldn’t find even one.\n\nMicah saw corruption in every corner. You know the old saying about “they get you coming and going”? Micah must have felt the same way—like there was no safe place, no one he could trust. When he reaches out to the best men he can find, he discovers them to be more like razor blades than friends (Micah 7:4).\n\nRemember how Elijah, after his victory at Mt. Carmel, looked around and despaired, believing that he was the only faithful man left in Israel. While he felt alone, God assured him that there were yet 7000 left in Israel who refused to bend their knees to Baal (1 Kings 18:16-45). Still, for both Micah and Elijah, the skies looked very dark, their hearts felt alone, and their vision felt dim. But darkness is not dark to God. He does not leave His people alone, and His vision never falters. No matter how alone we feel, there is still hope.\n\nEven in his darkness, Micah knows the truth. He declares that our only hope, our only safe confidant is the Lord (Micah 7:7). And we know that He cares, not just abstractly or on our birthdays, but presently. He invites us into ongoing relationship with Him even now (Micah 6:3-5). He does not leave us alone, even at night, even when we’re unemployed, even when we’re hungry.\n\nMicah urges those who still sit in darkness to cling to the God of salvation, the God who hears. No matter how dark the night, hope is close at hand: “though I sit in darkness, the Lord will be my light” (Micah 7:8).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessica Lamb\n\nScripture Reading: Nahum 1:1-15, 2 Kings 19:8–19\n\n“God is great, God is good, let us thank Him for our food.”  \n\nI don’t remember when I was first taught this prayer, but I do remember spending my childhood cheerfully chanting it each week in Sunday School over clear Dixie cups half filled with trail mix and graham crackers. This simple prayer was replaced by others as I grew older, but the essential truth it teaches about God in its opening line remains the same.\n\nGod is great. He is powerful, sovereign, and holy. We see this on full display in the opening verses of Nahum. Back in the book of Jonah, we read about Nineveh—how God responded with forgiveness and grace when the people of the city humbled themselves before God and turned away from their evil deeds.\n\nBut in the years after that deliverance, Nineveh, a city in the brutal, domineering nation of Assyria, had turned turned back to its sin. The redemptive work of God in their city was forgotten. In 2 Kings 2:10, we read how their king, Sennacherib, mocked the living God and His promises with a taunt: “Don’t let your God, on whom you rely, deceive you… will you be rescued?”\n\nIn Nahum chapter 1, the prophet shares God’s response to the actions of this unrepentant people: judgment will come to Nineveh. Our great God is just, slow to anger but righteous in dealing with sin, oppression, and plots against Him (vv.3,9).\n\nI sometimes feel whispers of Sennacherib’s taunt slipping into my thoughts as I read the Minor Prophets. The descriptions of the greatness of God remind me of my own rebellion, my own sinful nature. And so I wonder, Is this God I claim to rely on really to be trusted? Will I really be rescued? But the declaration of Nahum 1:7 drowns out those whispers:\n\n“The LORD is good,\na stronghold in a day of distress;\nhe cares for those who take refuge in him.”\n\nThis verse reminds us that God’s greatness is entwined with another essential truth: God is good. He is close to His people, a stronghold in days of distress. He is compassionate and gracious, abounding in mercy and kindness (Psalm 86:15). He is faithful even when we are not (2 Timothy 2:13). Through the work of Jesus, God invites us to know Him and belong to Him—extending the invitation even while we were sinners, rescuing us from suffering, despair, and the punishments our sins deserve (Romans 5:8). \n\nThis is our God, and He is always fully Himself. While passages like the judgment of Nineveh in Nahum show us the devastating consequences of sin, they also paint a picture of a God who is fully just, fully loving, and fully good in His response to wayward hearts and brokenness. \n\nAs we read through these Minor Prophets, we’ll read about God’s character, how He is present and active. He mourns, hurts, and acts in righteous anger. He comforts, rebukes, and restores. God reveals all this and more to us through His Word, which has the power to change us as we reflect on who He is: a God who is great, good, and fully invested in His people.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Nahum 2:1-13, Nahum 3:1-19, 2 Chronicles 32:9-23\n\nThe book of Nahum is the second act of a well-known story—the story of Jonah, a prophet chosen by God to go to the city of Nineveh to call its unrepentant people to God. But despite God’s calling, Jonah did not go to Nineveh; he went to the sea, was swallowed by a fish, and was eventually regurgitated. THEN he went to Nineveh, told the people to repent, and they did.\n\nHowever, the Ninevites’ repentance didn’t last long. Nineveh was the capital of Assyria, and Assyria was a terrible place. In an effort to describe Assyria, biblical scholars and historians have used words such as “cruel” and “arrogant,” “violent” and “tortuous.” This was a nation founded on bloodshed and established by massacre.\n\nAssyria had conquered Israel, the land of God’s people. The Israelites were exiled, their cities burned, and they were filled with sorrow and lament. All the while, Assyria’s power grew through oppression and violence. It was a superpower standing on a terrible foundation.\n\nNahum prophesies the destruction of Assyria in this short book, full of vivid images of violence. His sarcastic tone emphasizes his mocking of the Assyrians and is punctuated by the joy of the people who would “clap their hands” at the news of Assyria’s destruction (Nahum 3:19). Their oppressors would be destroyed.\n\nWhich is why, as hard as it is to remember, God had sent the Assyrians to overtake Israel initially. We see it in 2 Kings 17:6 and again in Isaiah 8:6–8:\n\n“Because these people rejected\nthe slowly flowing water of Shiloah…\nthe Lord will certainly bring against them\nthe mighty rushing water of the Euphrates River—\nthe king of Assyria and all his glory.\nIt will overflow its channels\nand spill over all its banks.\nIt will pour into Judah,\nflood over it, and sweep through,\nreaching up to the neck;\nand its flooded banks\nwill fill your entire land, Immanuel!”\n\nIsrael felt the consequences of their disobedience. And then their oppressors felt the wrath of God. The through line here is that God demands justice. Ecclesiastes 12:14 says, “For God will bring every act to judgment, including every hidden thing, whether good or evil.” The Old Testament sings of His faithfulness and mercy but also His impervious commitment to justice. God’s justice is bound up with His holiness and is part of the fabric of His universe. And His justice is satisfied in Christ alone.\n\nIn Isaiah 9, right after God’s declaration to send Assyria to overtake Israel, He makes a promise: a child would be born, a son would be given. A promise of a government and peace that would have no end (v.6).\n\nGod knew that the only way to satisfy His desire for justice was to send His Son—Himself—to stand in the place of His people. The God who warned, “Beware, I am against you. This is the declaration of the LORD of Armies” (Nahum 2:13), would turn that anger against Himself. His need for justice would be satisfied once for all time in the death of His Son. That Son would rise again, defeating death, with a promise to return and bring a peace that will have no end.\n\nCome, Lord Jesus!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Habakkuk 1:1-17, Psalm 13:1-6, Acts 13:40-41\n\nIt wasn’t until I was in college studying grammar and literature that I realized something: the word “wait” is an action verb. Something is happening, something is in motion—even when the word itself implies stasis. To wait on someone means to serve them by being actively present, even without words. In Habakkuk 1, waiting abounds. The people of God are waiting for an answer, and God is waiting until the time is right. Neither wait is wrong, still, or without action. \n\nHabakkuk says the law is “paralyzed, and justice never goes forth” (1:4, ESV). To God’s people, it feels as though they are stuck in the perpetual motion of law-keeping, not seeing any hope of the future God has promised them. They stand, waiting and begging, imploring the God of the universe to hear and answer and save. \n\nGod is also waiting, and His waiting is perfect within His predetermined time. He is not being pushed to any limit, and He is not worried about being too early or too late. He is present, even though He may appear silent. And His waiting is good, even though it may feel punitive to His people. \n\nI’m sure you’re waiting for something today. Just in the time I’ve written these last three paragraphs, three different individuals I know walked up to me here, at the coffee shop where I’m working. Each lamented different things they have begged God to see and act on, yet they feel He has remained silent toward their suffering.\n\nI am waiting for things, too. We are all waiting for something, and it can be very tempting to believe we are the only ones waiting. We can feel paralyzed in the waiting, left feeling that God is either ignorant of our pleas or intentionally avoiding an answer for us. But wait is a verb, and it is not one without action. God is at work in your waiting, and you are at work in it, too. Cry out to Him like Habakkuk, asking:\n\n“How long, LORD, must I call for help\nand you do not listen\nor cry out to you about violence\nand you do not save?” (v.2).\n\nDo not be afraid to bring Him your questions and emotion. God can handle your fear. He is rock solid and unchanging, but He is also acting, right now, on behalf of His children.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Five Woe Oracles",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Habakkuk 2:1-20, Proverbs 29:18, Hebrews 10:32-39\n\nLet’s be honest. Sin can be entertaining as a spectator sport. There’s a certain draw to the grit and gore of sin in the lives of other people, isn’t there? At first glance, Habakkuk 2 reads like a cage match to me. God calls out a series of sins, and we’re tempted to sit on the sidelines, cheering, while munching on popcorn. \n\n\n“Woe to the thief and extortionist!” (v.6, my paraphrasing).\nGet em, God! we cry\n.\n“Woe to the crook in his big, fancy house!” (v.9).\nTake him down a few notches! we say with a smirk.\n\n“Woe to the murderers and crime bosses!” (v.12).\nMake them pay! we heckle.\n\n“Woe to the drug dealer, the keg provider, the predator!” (v.15).\nLet ‘em have it! we roar.\n\n“Woe to the mystic!” (v.19).\nWe’re right, and they’re wrong! we boast.\n\nBut wait—look again. This passage isn’t punctuated with the celebration of the “righteous.” There are no “Atta, girls!” for us here. God follows the woes with a dose of truth, one that makes my eyes drop to the floor and my knees weak:\n\n“But the LORD is in his holy temple;\nlet the whole earth\nbe silent in his presence” (v.20).\n\nThe holiness of God is a spotlight none of us can bear. It isn’t just pointed toward the crooks and the cowards. It illuminates our sin, and then suddenly we don’t feel much like cheering anymore. Coming face to face with God’s holiness, His righteousness, we are silenced by the weight of our sin and our desperate need for mercy. Instead of screaming, “Woe to you!” our sin compels us to respond more like the prophet Isaiah: \n\n“Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty”\n(Isaiah 6:5, NIV).\n\nWe are a people prone to rebellion against the loving laws of God. We are more likely to obsess over our own reflection than the image of God we bear. We are selfish, self-reliant, and scared. We are shattered by sin, and there is not enough glue in the universe to repair us. And no matter how hard we try, we cannot clean ourselves up or drum up enough righteousness to stand before a holy God. Woe to us. \n\nThat’s the truth we must acknowledge before we can truly live out of the forgiveness and grace of our Savior, the grace we all need so desperately. Thank God, He gives it so generously to all nations and people groups (Titus 2:11). One day the whole earth will know the Lord’s glory (Habakkuk 2:14), but the ground will always be level at the foot of the cross. The gospel bids us to gather there—the thieves and the theologians, the swindlers and the savers, the predators and the preachers. We are all guilty, and our sin levels the playing field. But so does God’s grace. \n\nWe are sinners turned saints, orphans turned heirs. We were unrighteous, but now we are clothed in Christ’s righteousness. Blessed are we! The new covenant silences us once again, but this time our mouths aren’t silenced in fear. Instead, we are made speechless by the goodness of our grace-giving God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Habakkuk 3:1-19, Psalm 17:1-15, John 1:14-18, Galatians 3:11\n\nThe Broadway show, Mean Girls, is a spectacle. Hot pink and glitter, blonde hair and high-pitched voices—I saw them everywhere under the stage’s bright spotlight. As the play began, my eyes landed on Regina’s mother (played by Amy Poehler in the movie version). When her “Queen Bee” daughter arrives home with friends, the mother says: “There are no rules in this house! I’m not like a regular mom. I’m a cool mom.” Then she winks.\n\nRegina’s mother is a laughing stock. Out all of the kids in the movie, Regina needs a strong parent the most. And in trying to be the “cool” mom, she’s actually no mother at all. Her well-timed wink is proof of her weakness. \n\nI say this because we live in a time that would very much like for God to be a “cool” God. If He is all-forgiving, we suppose He is all-accommodating too. But we don’t have a God who winks at evil. In this passage in Habakkuk, we’re given explosive imagery, like a fresh pair of glasses with which to see God. Take the time to read the passage out loud and really envision the scene. \n\nAs I read this chapter, I imagine God standing in the midst of a city, turning His head back and forth, searching for something. He stomps through the earth, on the hunt. His brilliance is like light. Rays are flashing from His hand. Pestilence surrounds His feet. As I read Habakkuk 3 with this image in mind, a picture of God, I wonder, Should I fall in love with Him, or should I be afraid of Him?\n\nI think the author of Habakkuk wants us to feel that tension. Because God is attractive, He draws us to Him. But He is also terrifying. Whether we’re about to be saved or destroyed, the same thing is true: God is worthy of our awe (Habakkuk 3:2). In His presence, our mouths should drop open; He is worthy of our rapt attention.\n\nBut what is He doing in this passage? What is He after? Our answer can be found right in the middle of the chapter where the prophet tells us why God is on a rampage: “You come out to save Your people, to save Your anointed” (v.13).\n\nIn this book of poetry, I see God as a fierce fighter trampling wickedness, turning His head to the left and right, all in order to find and save me. This is such great news! God is not angry with me; He is angry with evil. God is not on a mission to destroy me; He is on a mission to destroy His enemies. That is why the last few verses of this chapter are so very powerful. Can I write my own version? Can you?\n\nEven if cancer takes the ones I love away\nEven if my marriage falters and fails\nEven if the house is empty of children forever\nEven if my career is cut short\nEven if my bank account is nearing zero\nEven if all I see is sorrow and pain and destruction—\nEven then I will rejoice in the Lord.\n\nI will trust Him.\n\nI will wait quietly for God to do His work, confident in His goodness and His timing.\n\nNo, God does not wink at our sin. But He loves His children, and He holds us in His arms, even as His feet stomp out the worst of the evil in this world.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Great Day of the Lord",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Zephaniah 1:1-18, Romans 9:19-24, 2 Peter 3:8-10\n\n“The day of the Lord…” \n\nThere are lots of passages throughout Scripture pointing to “the day of the Lord” as judgment, like Isaiah 13:6, which instructs the reader to “Wail! For the day of the LORD is near.” The instruction to “wail” suggests some sort of reckoning. But there are other passages that speak of a joyous day: “Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God, because his judgments are true and righteous” (Revelation 19:1–2).\n\nThe day of the Lord seems to be a culmination of things, when God will set all things aright. It is a day of judgment against wickedness—those who will not humble themselves will be humbled—and a day of salvation for those who love God. So our understanding of this event really depends on which camp we’re in; it all comes back to the saving grace of Jesus.\n\nThe prophecy we read in Zephaniah 1 is deeply troubling, thick with wrath, destruction, and a distressing commentary on our inability to save ourselves. The prophet’s words remind us of the great and awesome nature of God; He is not to be trifled with, and He will not be mocked. He will not leave sin unpunished, nor will He be placated with cheap offerings or empty lip service. He is a holy God, and He will purify all creation from the stain of wickedness. When the day of the Lord comes, those who have given their hearts over to the things of this world will be brought low.\n\nThat’s an uncomfortable idea. It requires us to examine our own hearts and ask ourselves, Am I like those who pledge loyalty to the Lord, while at the same time pledging loyalty to the world? Do I really long to see the goodness of the Lord above all else? We simply cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24). When we consider the day of the Lord, we ought to be driven to repentance.\n\nI am struck by these words in Zephaniah 1:7: “The LORD has prepared a sacrifice; he has consecrated his guests.” This would have been a familiar image to the Jews, because they understood what regular sacrifices in the temple entailed. Each sacrifice was a twofold sign: an image of God’s holy burning wrath against sin, and a reminder that God would provide a substitute payment for His people. Here, even in the midst of Zephaniah’s terrible warning, is a reminder of God’s just wrath poured out on Christ. \n\nThat was a day of judgment, of wrath and distress, of darkness and gloom, when Christ’s blood was poured out on our behalf. Even now, “the great day of the LORD is near, near and rapidly approaching” (Zephaniah 1:14). May knowing this truth lead us to repentance. May it lead us to Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Zephaniah 2:1-15, Psalm 27:7-10, Romans 11:1-6\n\nOftentimes, I find myself deeply influenced by other people rather than by Jesus. I scroll Instagram and find new recipes, new decorating tips, new fashion ideas, and myriad examples of my self-assigned inadequacy. It’s dangerous, because it draws me deeper into the trappings of this world and further away from pinning all my hope on the person and work of Christ. \n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with Insta-inspiration or the longing for beauty that it stirs up within me. But that longing for beauty will never be satisfied outside of eternity, outside of the God who created beauty.  \n\nZephaniah chapter 2 opens with a call to repentance for the people of God, who had succumbed to the lure of the idols of their pagan neighbors. The passage addresses Israel but focuses on the impending judgment of Israel’s enemies. The first two verses strike straight into my heart: \n\n“Gather yourselves together;\ngather together, undesirable nation,\nbefore the decree takes effect\nand the day passes like chaff,\nbefore the burning of the LORD’s anger overtakes you,\nbefore the day of the LORD’s anger overtakes you.”\n\nIn the original Hebrew text, the word “goy” is used for the word “nation”—a word typically used to identify nations other than Israel. We know, however, that in these verses, the prophet is addressing Israel, specifically. So why use “goy”? Because Israel had become so influenced by the surrounding pagan nations that she had become like one of them: more pagan than godly. \n\nThe lure of idols brought Israel to the brink of destruction. My idols are not made of gold, nor do I worship them in pagan temples, but I am so desperately drawn to the fleeting beauty of the material world. I chase after it. I demand it. I see what my neighbors have, and I want more and better. From the outside, I’m sure I appear more worldly than godly—an assertion I really cannot deny. \n\nGod set aside the people of Israel for Himself, for His glory. But they turned away from Him and toward the gleaming idols of their pagan neighbors. He has called me to Himself. I am so thankful He did, and I’m grateful for the reminder today to keep my heart focused on Jesus and His glory, not the glories of this world.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Zephaniah 3:1-20, Isaiah 30:18, Hebrews 7:22-28\n\n“Woe to the city that is rebellious and defiled, the oppressive city!” declares Zephaniah (3:1). Woe is a scary word, isn’t it? It is a word used to indicate deep grief and calamity. It is a declaration of impending ruin, tidings of bad times to come. Who wants to talk about woeful tidings? I’d rather talk about joyful ones (Isaiah 9:6). But here in Zephaniah 3, the word woe is offered as a relief because it signals the end of injustice and the dawn of righteousness and hope.\n\nGod’s rebuke of Jerusalem centers on its inversion of justice and injustice. Leaders, prophets, and priests are supposed to uphold justice, not instigate injustice, right? But that’s just what they are guilty of, and so God’s rebuke is followed by a series of specific indictments. The rulers of the city are characterized as lions who devour, rather than shepherds who protect. The prophets are reckless, not wise. The priests are profane, not holy. And when God confronts them, their response is not repentance, but increased corruption. All of this sounds a little convicting and familiar.\n\nBut God “applies his justice morning by morning; he does not fail at dawn” (v.5). He cannot abide continuing injustice, but restores righteousness. Woe to those who persist in doing injustice! The final fulfillment of God’s promise is found in Christ, who is the true King, Prophet, and Priest—just, wise, and holy.\n\nHis restoration, however, is not only a resetting of the social order; it’s also the transformation of a people, who will be marked by pure speech and wholehearted devotion to the Lord. Their sins will be washed away, and they will walk in humility, meekness, righteousness, and truthfulness before God. On His holy mountain, they will dwell in peace and security.\n\nThe contrasting images of woeful ruin and righteous security are often hard for us to grasp simultaneously, but we find them perfectly pictured in the image of God as a warrior who saves. His warfare is the warfare both of justice and of salvation. But He is not just a warrior who saves—He is a warrior who sings. In one of the most beautiful verses in the Bible, we read: \n\n“The LORD your God is among you,\na warrior who saves.\nHe will rejoice over you with gladness.\nHe will be quiet in his love.\nHe will delight in you with singing” (v.17).\n\nYou! With all your injustices and vices, and in spite of your failings—when God looks at you, He sees Christ’s perfect righteousness. He rejoices over you with gladness, delight, and singing. Thanks be to God for both His justice and His love. Hear His faithful promises today, and let your heart be quieted and calmed by His love.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Haggai 1:1-15, Ezra 4:24-5:5, Ephesians 2:19-22\n\nPractically speaking, the Israelites had good reason to put off building the temple. It wasn’t too far in the past that Babylon had burned the first one to the ground. They feared that if they put all of their time, money, and political capital into rebuilding it, it might end up being a waste in the end. What if someone else came and destroyed it again? In response, they lived safe, small lives that created little of lasting value. But then Haggai arrived with a word from the Lord, and twice he says to God’s people, “Consider your ways” (Haggai 1:5, ESV).\n\nConsider your ways. Think carefully about what you do and why you do it.\n\nWhen I consider my ways, I realize that like the people of Israel, I spend time farming in fields that bear no real fruit in my life. I pour money and resources into things that are temporary—things that, though opulent, never feel like enough. I dress my spiritual wounds with consumer comforts. I go to quick-fixes, partly because they seem to temporarily work, and partly because I’ve been conditioned to reach for them without even thinking. I spend a lot less time considering, and more time acting out of compulsion. Much like the Israelites, I often feel like my money goes into a “bag with holes” (v.6). \n\nYikes. Sorry, God. \n\nIt would be easy to stop there and conclude that this passage is meant to encourage me to be more holy with the way I spend money. But is that what Haggai is saying? Is the point to give more to charity and stop wasting time? Maybe. Lord knows I have work to do in those arenas. But I think there’s more to what God is saying here. Over and over again throughout Scripture, the Lord invites His people to give Him everything—not because He is angry with them or needs something from them, but because He wants to prove Himself trustworthy. \n\nIn this story, God doesn’t leave His people to build the temple alone. He gives them His presence. He tells them, “I am with you” (v.13), and He doesn’t stop there. Along with His presence, He provides for them abundantly. Though the Israelites are willing to sacrifice their hard-earned money to build the temple, God works a bureaucratic miracle, and King Darius ends up paying for the whole thing!\n\nThough it is terrifying to risk everything, our God delights in filling our empty hands. God didn’t need Israel’s finances—He wanted their faith. He was less concerned about their wallets and more concerned with their willingness to take Him at His Word. He pointed out the powerlessness of their pennies in order to wake them up to their purpose.\n\nAt the beginning of this story, the Israelites looked at rebuilding the temple like powering through a spreadsheet, a to-do list. By the end, they’ve experienced what it’s like to live with the resources of a holy, all-powerful God. It’s exciting to serve a God this big, this extravagant and trustworthy. He asks me to consider my small ways, and then He invites me into His bigger, more miraculous plans for my life. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Haggai 2:1-23, Romans 8:9-10, Hebrews 12:26\n\nI suppose we’re all a little skeptical in the promises department. We feel like we need some collateral when someone makes one. But as a woman, as a Christ-follower, and as a broken person in desperate need of healing—nothing has changed me more than the Word of God, and more specifically, His promises to His people.\n\nAs the scattered Israelites stared at their ruined temple, God’s promises, voiced through Haggai, must have seemed impossible. And yet He fulfilled His promises in ways they never could have fathomed. Jesus would one day restore the temple. In fact, He would become the temple (John 2:19). \n\nHe will keep His promises to us too. Everywhere we see destruction in our lives, we will one day see restoration. Where we feel only brokenness, we will one day experience healing. The grief we know so intimately now will one day be replaced with deep, lasting joy. Right now, this very moment, Jesus is working to make all things new. It won’t be long now. \n\nDeath will die. Tears will dry. All brokenness will mend. And where we currently see rubble, we will see a world re-built on the bedrock promises of God. \n\nWhen? In the words of the Lord Himself, “in a little while” (Haggai 2:6). The time between this moment and the fulfillment of the beautiful promises of God is short. On the radar screen of eternity, the time between now and the realization of His promises is just a blip. And as we wait, He tells us, “My Spirit is present among you; don’t be afraid” (Haggai 2:5; see also Romans 8:10). His words are not just an encouragement, but a promise too.\n\nBased on the evidence of their current circumstances, the Israelites had reason to believe that God had abandoned them and reneged on His promises. Yet through the prophet Haggai, God reminded them to get their eyes off the brokeness because He is a God who comes through. If they’d only turn toward Him, they would see it! The call is the same for us, to lift our eyes from the brokenness inside us and all around us. We can look forward with great hope because God’s promises are true! \n\n“For people swear by something greater than themselves, and for them a confirming oath ends every dispute. Because God wanted to show his unchangeable purpose even more clearly to the heirs of the promise, he guaranteed it with an oath, so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us” (Hebrews 6:16–18). \n\nHung on a cross, Jesus chose to die for us. His finished work there is our collateral. We are a broken yet redeemed people, stitched together with a promise. There is something better coming. It won’t be long now. Just a little while. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nFrom beginning to end, the Bible tells the story of God’s redemptive plan. Zechariah’s prophecies anticipate the grand culmination of history, describing a coming glorious king and a world where everything is set right. While Zechariah prophesies judgment for the wicked, his message is filled with hope and glorious promises for God’s people.\n\nZechariah’s eight visions portend restoration for the righteous and punishment for the unrepentant. At the heart of these prophecies is the promise that the Lord is the one who enables repentance. The message of Zechariah’s first three night visions amounts to one urgent directive: repent.\n\nFirst, we see an angel (some scholars suggest this is a figure of Christ) standing among the myrtle trees, sending out messengers to do His will, speaking words of comfort and love for God’s people. He promises restoration and mercy, offering an invitation to come back to Him: “Return to me… and I will return to you” (Zechariah 1:3). \n\nSome people hold up an image of the God of the Old Testament as being angry all the time, but that’s a false image—one that’s quite inconsistent with Scripture as a whole. No matter where we turn in the pages of the Bible, we will find a God who is holy and who hates evil, but simultaneously loves His creation and offers abundant mercy to all who will heed His tender offer. And that’s what we see in Zechariah.\n\nThe second vision is of the might of Judah’s oppressors, which appear as horns. But their oppression is short-lived, as craftsmen approach and quickly dismantle their power. The third vision is of a surveyor, measuring the city of Jerusalem, the city of God’s people. Here, we again see God’s abundant mercy and blessing, as God’s people, set free from their captivity, have their dwelling place with God.\n\nIf we’d lived in Zechariah’s day, we, too, would have a long list of grievances to call our courage into question. The temple, whose foundations had been laid by the returning Jewish exiles, remained incomplete—a seemingly hopeless, abandoned project. Prophets had come and gone, but their words had made little effect. The people of Judah still did not seem to have a vision for a restored kingdom, and instead intermingled with the world around them. \n\nHave you also looked about and found discouragement in your world? Have you seen a lackluster church or half-hearted believers? Perhaps you have found these same roots of a sluggish faith in your own heart and are discouraged. Here is the good news: Christ, the Lord of Armies, comes to us, riding on a white horse. He has come to unseat the power of the oppressor and to set free the captives. He beckons to the sluggish, Come out of Babylon! (Zechariah 2:7). Christ the Lord of hosts has come to dwell with His people, bringing joy and gladness! (v.10).\n\nOften our great discouragement comes from fixing our eyes on the woes of the world and the trepidations of our heart, rather than fixing our eyes upon Christ. The anger of the Lord of armies is a call to bring us back home. Zechariah reminds us that our vision is to be fixed upon Him alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nWe adopted two of our sons from Ethiopia nine years ago today. It has been a long journey for all of us, and I am so glad that I’m nine years down this road and not back at the starting line. As soon as we leapt over that starting line and landed on the ground in Africa, I thought I was probably going to die. We later realized I was just pregnant with baby number four. When the nannies thrust two sweet, sad, screaming boys at us we realized we were massively unprepared. \n\nThe early part of our adoption story is filled with diapers, fungi, and giardia. I remember how I longed to have all of the filth removed from my children and my home, but it seemed an unending struggle. And our boys couldn’t fix it themselves. Those sweet babies needed love, and sometimes latex-gloved hands, to help them out.\n\nJust like helpless, sick toddlers from an orphanage with no running water, we, too, came to Christ dressed in filthy clothes. And we couldn’t get free of it on our own. Notice that in the fourth vision from today’s reading, the Lord doesn’t say to Joshua, “Get yourself cleaned up!” but instead “Take off his filthy clothes!” (Zechariah 3:4). He needed someone to do it for him, and so do we.\n\nChrist removes our iniquity, and then He clothes us in festive robes (v.4). I love how the gospel gives us a total turn-around. He could have replaced filthy garments with a reasonable and sensible second-hand T-shirt. That’s certainly better than where we were. But Christ loves us and dresses us in the best He has to offer. He washes us clean and elevates us from the gutter to His right hand, like true sons and daughters.\n\nNot only are our filthy rags removed, but we are made to dwell in the shadow of His covering, where we, now filled with the joy of the good news of the gospel, may invite our neighbors to also find rest (v.10). And as sons and daughters, we are invited to walk in His way and keep His mandates (v.7). \n\nJust as we are unable to make ourselves clean by our own scrubbing, we are also dependent upon Him and His constant character. Our newness of life is achieved “not by strength or by might, but by my Spirit” (Zechariah 4:6). God is the one who makes the mountains a plain (v.7) and removes all obstacles. In this case, Zechariah prophesied the seemingly impossible completion of the temple. But in its true fulfillment, Christ establishes His temple and makes the mountains into plains (Isaiah 40:4). He alone breaks down the barriers of sin, and declares us righteous, a fit dwelling place for His Spirit. \n\nAnd, newly cleansed, we will see that just as the temple completion in restored Jerusalem was the work of God alone, so also the conversion of our hearts and the cleansing of our guilt is achieved through grace (Zechariah 4:7).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI definitely do not want my living room to be visited by a giant flying scroll. I do not want to see a shrine built to the basket o’ wickedness. And I feel quite uneasy about dappled horses patrolling north, west, east, and south. The visions God gave to Zechariah can be both creative and terrifying. They reveal how God shows kindness to His people while bringing judgment to the wicked. Puritan commentator Matthew Henry reminds us that while the pillar of fire in Egypt was a beacon of promise to Israel, it was a swirling black portent to the Egyptians.\n\nWe tend to think of judgment as only that which follows sin, but whenever God allows people to devote themselves to wickedness, that also is a judgment. God sends the basket of wickedness to Shinar—the land of Babylon—and it is placed upon a shrine to be worshiped. In other words, He is telling His people that if it’s evil and wickedness they want, they can return to Babylon. But make no mistake: there is no good thing in that basket, only wickedness. Or they can choose to stay in Judah and return to the Lord. He is coming, and He will keep His promises.\n\nVisions and prophecies are difficult to interpret—that is one thing commentators and biblical scholars can agree on. However, one thing is clear: The Lord is the Lord of the whole earth. All the lands are His, and His ministers roam to and fro, doing His bidding. He alone is Lord and God. And that is truly comforting to His people, because He is a good God.\n\nZechariah looked to see what was approaching, and though the images are striking, the substance of His visions fits with what we already know of the gospel. The final image here is of the crowned priest-king who “will build the LORD’s temple; he will be clothed in splendor and will sit on his throne and rule… People who are far off will come and build the LORD’s temple, and you will know that the LORD of Armies has sent me to you (Zechariah 6:13,15). The reign of righteousness established by the Branch is a foreshadowing of Christ, the true Priest-King, who alone “fully obeys the Lord” (vv.9–15). No matter what our circumstances might look like, no matter what disappointments surround us, no matter how we’ve failed, our only hope is Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThis passage in Zechariah is beautiful. The people of Israel, just like all of us, keep missing the heart of the matter. For example, when I apologize to my husband for, say, driving the wheels of our bus into the tiny wall that separates the road from a 400-foot cliff drop in Glacier National Park, I’m tempted to just make a legalistic show of it. Once I’ve said the words, “I’m sorry,” I expect him to snap out of it, get back on the bus, and forgive me for my adventurous driving maneuvers. (The road was very narrow, you see.) We teach children this same formula of repentance: \n\n“Say you’re sorry.” \n“I’m sorry.” \n“Okay, I forgive you.”\n(Transaction complete.)\n\nBut just going through the motions of repentance does not true repentance make. In today’s passage, the residents of Bethel come to Jerusalem to ask about an upcoming fast. They’re prepared to go through the tired motions of keeping it, but they don’t mean it. Have you ever fasted “unto the Lord” but really just with an eye on your swimsuit-season prospects? Have you ever, like me, apologized with the goal of just getting on with it, instead of engaging in true sorrow and repentance over hurting someone?\n\nWe’ve all been on the receiving end of bad repentance and know what a mockery it is. Yet are we foolish enough to think that, somehow, by going through the motions, we can appease a holy and almighty God. God sees right through all of this, of course (Zechariah 7:5). He’s obviously not fooled by the sorry recitations of His people. But here’s the unexpected gorgeousness of His goodness: He doesn’t want to keep us fasting and dredging and reciting forever—these are just training tools. He wants to bring us into feasting and celebration. He wants us to reap goodness and abundance (8:12).\n\nThis is precisely why He calls His people to repent. Genuine repentance is never mere lip service. It is a transformation. It is a turning of heart, soul, mind, and strength from the folly and filth of sin to the hope and goodness of God. When the Lord of Armies declares His zeal and His jealousy for Jerusalem, it is a zeal and jealousy not only for His glory, but also for our good! The justice and mercy of God are not a contradiction, but a harmonious accord. Because of His faithful love, He would have us also “show faithful love and compassion to one another” (Zechariah 7:9). He comes to transform us, that we may be like Him, that we also may “love truth and peace” (8:19).\n\nHe is calling us away from fighting over the cereal on the floor under the kids’ table to join Him for the real meat and drink at the feast. He transforms us from petty and insincere beggars to dear children who dance and play in the congregation of His people (Zechariah 8:3–5). The fasting of genuine repentance, in God’s economy, always produces the joyful feast of salvation.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI like to be right. But it’s not always enough to be right. \n\nAs a child, I would pertly correct my little sister with bits of wisdom such as, “Frankenstein is actually the name of the doctor, so the monster could more accurately be called ‘Frankenstein’s monster.’” After that, my mom patiently explained to me that there is a difference between being right and being obnoxiously right. It’s important to know the difference, because even if the proper pluralization of “cul de sac” is actually “culs de sac,” you still kinda want to roll your eyes at someone for pointing it out. We’ve probably all been on the receiving end of someone else’s unsolicited commentary that is so obnoxiously right that they’re just wrong.\n\nChrist, on the other hand, is always right. He is the definition of right. But—and this is the amazing part—He is graciously right. The Lord conquers graciously. He does not conquer us and then commence with trash talk or years of making us feel inadequate. To be conquered by Him is to win the greatest victory of all time. Remember Jacob, wrestling the angel of the Lord at Peniel—he was injured but that was the only way to win the victory (Genesis 32:22–31).\n\nIn Zechariah 9, we see how the word of the Lord promises to come against the lands that surround His people, places renowned for their wickedness, like Tyre and Sidon. Though these nations and peoples have gathered temporal wealth, God will strip it all away. Though they have amassed the might of violent arms, their pride will be destroyed. Their wealth will be cast into the sea, and they will be “consumed by fire” (v.4). This is the language of God’s judgment against the wicked. \n\nBut a striking thing happens: when their kings have been removed, their strength has been destroyed, and their hope has failed, then God will turn and be gracious. He will even make of them a remnant, as He had with the clan of Judah.\n\nThe image of the great King of Zion, riding on the colt of a donkey is the perfect depiction of Christ, who wages war with an offer of peace, and destroys His enemies with His own death. He confounds the wisdom of the world, and undoes the reasoning of our own hearts. \n\n“Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion!  Shout in triumph, Daughter Jerusalem!  Look, your King is coming to you;  he is righteous and victorious.”  –Zechariah 9:9\n\nAll too often, the Old Testament judgments of God are misunderstood and characterized as vindictive and punitive. But Zechariah 9 is a reminder of the true nature of His judgment. While He does indeed detest idolatry and wickedness, His judgments cannot be separated from His love. \n\nI am reminded of C.S. Lewis’s statement in The Problem of Pain: “If God were proud He would hardly have us on such terms: but He is not proud, He stoops to conquer, He will have us even though we have shown that we prefer everything else to Him, and come to Him because there is ‘nothing better’ now to be had.” \n\nThe Creator of the universe has donned the garb of a servant to humbly wash the filth from our feet. As He did with Saul on the road to Damascus, our God comes to convert enemies into beloved children.\n\nHe stoops to conquer our hearts. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nReading well is all about understanding contexts. That’s what I tell my students. Otherwise, how are we to unpack images asking for spring rain, when we really think April showers have been a little too abundant this year? Why be concerned about not having a shepherd? You could just hire one from the local Christmas pageant. Even more puzzling: How do we muster up the imagination to envision a docile, aimless little flock of sheep turning into a mighty steed? And what about cornerstones and tent pegs? Needless to say, these aren’t typical, daily ponderings for most of us. \n\nBut before we get sidetracked by these images themselves, let’s remind ourselves of the main message behind them: No matter what, God’s people are to trust Him—specifically, to trust that He will bring us home. And that is what we’re longing for: home. We’re longing for stability—maybe that’s what the cornerstones and tent pegs are all about. We’re longing for families reconciled. (Did you notice the “houses” of Judah and Joseph coming together after long centuries of hostility?) We’re longing to be brought safely through troubled waters to arrive at home. \n\nThe first image drawn directly from Zechariah’s geographical context is embedded in numerous prophetic messages. In a part of the world where it generally rains only between October and March, those extra showers in April were (and are) a gift. In response to Israel’s obedience, God promised rain in its season, even mentioning the autumn and spring rains (Deuteronomy 11:13–15). Drought and famine, however, were always lurking around the seasonal corner if God’s people were disobedient (vv.16–17). \n\nThe invitation to ask God for the blessing of rain is followed by warnings against sliding into the deceitful orbit of household gods (teraphim) and diviners. We should not be tempted into thinking this warning was just for Israel—that is was their problem and not ours today. But not so fast. Sure, teraphim and diviners don’t show up much in our social media feeds these days, but the misplaced hope the people wholeheartedly placed in those practices is a little too familiar. \n\nDivination had everything to do with determining if the gods were going to show favor to them. Magic meant manipulating those presumed deities to get them to be favorable, to meet the people’s desires. The household gods were part of this network, too. Zechariah called them out on their behavior, telling them their self-serving “trust” lay in the wrong places. \n\nThen and now, it is God who gives blessing and assurance, with the ultimate purpose that we be a blessing to others. Diviners, whether ancient or modern-day, produce only emptiness and deceit. How about us? Where do we focus our attention as we seek a good and secure life? What are our cornerstones and tent pegs as we try to hold our fragile life structures together? Can we truly say that God indeed is our Cornerstone? That is essential to coming home and walking securely in the name of the Lord (Zechariah 10:12).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nWe have a tough lesson coming up, no matter how we try to soften the blow. When leaders neglect their responsibilities, the consequences are grave—for everyone, in every time and every place. The opening imagery of this chapter sweeps through mighty cedars, majestic cypresses, sturdy oaks of Bashan, and the thickets of the Jordan. All have come crashing to ruin, and how great is their fall! \n\nAgainst that devastating backdrop, the images shift to shepherds, a common figure for leaders in the Old Testament. It is important to make that connection because our “church-shaped” lens has relegated shepherds to the margins of society, which is where they had landed by the time of Jesus. Centuries before, however, shepherds in the ancient Near East had significant power and status because they controlled extensive sources of income: their flocks. \n\nZechariah’s bad shepherds—there were more than one—were missing some critical character traits. Good shepherds invested days and months of arduous labor as they migrated great lengths with their flocks to find food and water. In order to protect their sheep from threats of all kinds, they watched over them for long stretches of hours at a time. They cared for those that were diseased, and knew each sheep by name and touch. The shepherd’s staff was a symbol of care, giving assistance and direction, and of leadership and rescue. As Timothy Laniak states in his book While Shepherds Watch Their Flocks, good shepherds were skilled and trustworthy, “willing to take responsibility for the work,” whatever it may entail. \n\nThis description is a stark contrast to Zechariah’s harsh indictment of the shepherd God would appoint to bring judgment on the wayward people. He “does not care for those being destroyed, or seek the young or heal the maimed or nourish the healthy, but devours the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hooves” (Zechariah 11:16, ESV). No wonder the chapter ends with a pronouncement of woe over that shepherd who deserted the flock and gave up on them, in essence, saying, “let them all die or destroy each other” (v.9, my paraphrase). He broke his staff called Favor (symbolizing the end of covenant compassion and rescue), and then demanded his payment: thirty pieces of silver. Judas betrayed the ultimate Good Shepherd for the same price (Matthew 26:14–15; 27:3–10).\n\nThis is heart-wrenching for what it says about the human condition behind the imagery. Those who bought and sold were only concerned with the profit. It’s hard not to think of the modern-day scourge of global human trafficking. Which begs the question: How can thoughtful and compassionate leaders intervene to stop the utter dissolution of social structures originally designed for our protection? \n\nWhile this is a gloomy picture, to be sure, it would be incomplete without returning to the words of the Good Shepherd: “My sheep hear my voice, I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27). Jesus assures that no one is able to snatch those sheep out of the Father’s hand (vv.28–30).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nWhen we are being swept away by uncontrollable and terrifying circumstances, we search for an anchor, a declaration of truth, something we can cling to. This is true even when frightening events are relatively brief; their impact is felt long after that initial experience. The full force of this reality wallops us in this chapter of Zechariah. Jerusalem’s agony is palpable—a city in the path of violence, under siege, and attacked by all the nations. It’s hard to imagine the abject horror of their situation, especially for those of us who are blessed to live in peaceful, secure environments. \n\nIt’s no wonder then that the identity of the mighty Master of the Universe is pre-eminent. It is the Lord who stretched out the heavens, gave the earth its foundation, and shaped the spirits of humans, unpredictable though we may be. The clans of Judah, acting as a protective envelope around Jerusalem, emphatically restated this truth: “‘The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the Lord Almighty is their God’” (Zechariah 12:5). This is a perspective worth seizing, worth holding onto with all our might, especially when we feel beaten up. Our strength lies only in the Lord our God. \n\nThe people of Zechariah’s day knew their own recent history. Jerusalem had been under siege and the people had been taken captive to Babylon. This was the broken Jerusalem over which Jeremiah lamented (Lamentations 1:1–17). Some seventy years later, life in Jerusalem was still precarious. Even so, the prophet’s vision ranged far forward to a day of salvation and glory for Judah, for the house of David, and for Jerusalem. In the meantime, while Jerusalem would indeed be severely attacked, the people of the city would also be “a cup that causes staggering” and “a heavy stone” to all the surrounding nations (Zechariah 12:2–3). It’s a not-so-subtle warning to consider the consequences before attacking Jerusalem. \n\nBut now the picture takes an odd turn. The house of David and those who lived in Jerusalem would be compelled to plead for mercy as they look upon the Lord, the one they had pierced. That piercing reverberates into the crucifixion of Jesus (John 19:36–37). This sense of calamitous loss and deep need for repentance overwhelms any triumph that might have surfaced in the immediately prior events—and that is as it should be. \n\nJerusalem and the whole land would mourn, but the greater emphasis is on each “house” by itself—the house of David and his son, Nathan; the house of Levi and his descendant, Shimei. Echoes of kings and priests. Women, traditionally the mourners (Lamentations 2:5; Jeremiah 9:17–22), were intentionally separate and profoundly engaged in the repentance necessary for the forthcoming cleansing fountain (Zechariah 13:1). And clearly, there is more to come.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nAs you read this chapter, do you notice a radical shift part way through? First, the esteemed person of the prophet comes under fire. Then the focus swivels back to the enigmatic figure of the shepherd. Zechariah pronounced judgment on the prophets with just about the same contemptuous tone as he treated idols. Why take prophets to task in the first place? These, after all, were the men and women who were called to preach God’s revealed Word to the people, both to warn and to encourage them. It seems, however, something had gone awry. \n\nTo help us process this, we can easily look to our own contemporary churches. No, it’s not my intention to pummel the church with criticism. Instead, I’m just curious to discover good aspects of ministry that can go off track for one reason or another. Taking a closer look might just help us to be on guard in our home churches.\n\nTwo things come to mind. First, is music ministry, which has a long tradition of well-trained practitioners that can be traced back all the way to the excellent preparation of the Levites in ministry (1 Chronicles 25:1–7). The second is preaching, which carries on the same prophetic tradition mentioned above.\n\nSadly, lots of “stuff” often gets in the way of accomplishing good and noble goals—stuff that tends to revolve around egos and crowd-pleasing. Of course, we all suffer from these same kinds of human pitfalls in one way or another, so please know that I’m not trying to hunt down specks in the eyes of sisters and brothers in ministry while remaining blind to my own sin.\n\nBut back to the point: Do you see the connection, how these same nagging traits contributed to the rejection of the prophetic ministry we encounter in Zechariah? The prophets’ bad reputation was a carry-over from the steady stream of deceit uttered by false prophets in Jeremiah’s day, lulling the people to sleep instead of issuing wake-up calls. These false prophets told the people what they wanted to hear, which undermined Jeremiah’s warnings and pleas for repentance. At this point, you could say that parts of Jeremiah 23 sound a lot like Zechariah. Seventy years later, following a brutal exile, God’s people were still trying to put their lives back together. (May God spare us all from the sober consequences of crowd-pleasing preaching!) \n\nWith the dismissal of the prophets, the shepherd surfaces again. No longer called “worthless,” he is now close to the Lord Almighty. The next words from the Lord are the command to strike the shepherd, followed by the observation that the sheep would scatter, and the warning that God’s hand would be turned against those little ones (see Matthew 26:31). \n\nThis is difficult to read. Nevertheless, two allusions restore our hope. First, from our New Testament perspective, we know that the Good Shepherd promised to lay down His life for His sheep (John 10:11–18); Jesus said it four times. Second, even though the final image of the refining fire is terrifying, the end products are purified silver and gold. And through it all, we are God’s people, and He is our God (Zechariah 13:9). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nHonestly? I don’t know what to do with this chapter. From pillage to plague to panic—turns out the challenges for Jerusalem were not finally resolved in chapter 12. Attacks against it continue to ratchet up, but not for long. There is hope ahead: The Lord stands victorious on the Mount of Olives; a major seismic event shifts the mountain; there is strange, indescribable daylight; and water flows from Jerusalem east and west in all seasons. Echoing Ezekiel, pointing back to Eden, and looking forward to Revelation, this is the river of the water of life, nurturing fruitfulness and healing, and ending the curse (Ezekiel 47:1–12; Revelation 22:1–5).\n\nSomewhere along the way, Jerusalem will be secured—for good—and survivors from the nations that were attacking the city will experience an about-face and will come to Jerusalem every year to worship! It’s no wonder their minds were changed; the plague unleashed against them is hideous to behold. Their journey to Jerusalem will be a pilgrimage, coinciding with the Feast of Tabernacles, and former enemies will now be part of that annual celebration! (See Deuteronomy 16:13–15.) \n\nThink of a possible connection to the Gospels. This final appearance of the Lord on the Mount of Olives, linked with the Feast of Tabernacles, may underlie one of Peter’s irrepressible outbursts. Upon seeing Jesus transfigured before his very eyes as they were on a high mountain, he offered to make three tents (tabernacles) for Moses, Elijah, and Jesus (Matthew 17:1–4). The former two make their final Old Testament appearance at the end of Malachi, anticipating the coming Day of the Lord. Peter expressed his Messianic expectations, lodged in a fabric of biblical allusions.\n\nIt seems that what I initially dismissed as a hodgepodge of imagery in Zechariah 14, is actually spot-on. The Lord will appear! How will we possibly wrap our minds around everything that will be part of that marvelous spectacle?\n\nOne thing is certain: The Lord will be the one and only King over all the earth—even cooking pots and horse bells will testify to that truth as they will be inscribed with “holy to the Lord.” Everyone and everything will bow in allegiance. This will be a radical shift away from the culture of today. It makes me wonder how we will even handle what’s to come. \n\nIndeed, we are left with questions. That’s the way it should be when we are privy to even the smallest hints regarding the unknown future. How could we possibly tie it all up in a tidy package? Nevertheless, here’s a safe and familiar resting place: we trust in the Lord who was, and is, and is to come. He sits on the throne alongside the Lamb, and we will see His face in the new Jerusalem (Revelation 22:1–5). Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI am indescribably lucky to have the friends that I do. Describing us as “friends” seems too weak, in fact. We’ve been friends since college, and some of us since middle school and even earlier. We are in each other’s lives daily: in the good and bad, the clear and the messy, and everything in between. There are almost twenty of us, married couples and singles, brothers and sisters, roommates and travel buddies. We float in between one other’s homes, dropping our kids and our stuff here and there. We’ve swapped house keys and life stories, and we hold them both with the fiercest grip we can. \n\nI think what makes this particularly strong group of friends so secure is not that we all think the same way or like the same things. We don’t. And it’s not that we root for the same teams or go to the same churches, or laugh at the same jokes. What makes us us is our history, the steadfast faithfulness of friends that have linked arms and stood down the hardest—and celebrated the best—of what this world has to offer. \n\nWhen I read the first verses of the book of Malachi, I think about my friends and our history. (Malachi is a book of prophetic satire, written in the form of questions-and-answers between the Lord and His people.) When the Lord says, “I have loved you,” and the people scoff back, the Lord reminds them what it means to be loved by Him.\n\nBeing loved by God didn’t mean that the people always followed Him. It didn’t mean that He didn’t follow through with His promise to exile them when they turned away (see Deuteronomy 30:4–6). Being loved by God didn’t mean everything would always go right, but it did mean that He would bless them because of the promises He made to Abraham and Jacob (Romans 9:6–13). \n\nMalachi contrasts their fate with Edom’s, the group descended from Esau, who was not chosen by the Lord in the same way Israel was. Edom would be destroyed completely. Israel had felt destruction during the exile, but had been restored. \n\nThe opening disputation of Malachi (there are six that we will read this week) is a reminder, a wake up call to a lackadaisical people. They are loved, have been loved, and will be loved by the Lord. Forever.\n\nWhen we look to the grand narrative of the Bible, we see the continued faithfulness of the Lord to His people. In the Old Testament, it is to His chosen people in Israel, the sons and daughters of Jacob. In the New Testament, Jesus brings the message of hope and restoration to all people, Israelite or not. My faith finds its footing in these stories, in the reminders of the book of Malachi and in the testimonies of God’s steadfast faithfulness throughout Scripture and history. I am loved, I have been loved, and I will be loved—forever. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nWhen my daughter was first learning about sharing with other people, she used to say the funniest things. She would say, “I AM sharing. Sharing with ME.”\n\nWe’d laugh it off, and thankfully as she’s grown she has become an incredibly kind, encouraging, and giving person, willing to share with whomever is around. But when she was little, those feeble attempts at “sharing” were empty gestures. She wasn’t really sharing; she was just saying the words. \n\nIn the second disputation in Malachi, we see the Lord call out the Israelite priests for the same type of behavior. They were sacrificing, yes, but they were sacrificing blind and lame animals. Some animals were stolen, and some were sick. Not only were the priests violating the Mosaic covenant (Leviticus 22:18–25), but they dismissed the Lord’s accusations. \n\nThe Lord is righteously angry with the priests. The system of sacrifice He had established to make a way for unclean people to be clean was breaking down. The priests disregarded the law, made nonchalant offerings, and then claimed, “What a nuisance!”\n\nThe priests weren’t really sacrificing. They were going through the motions, but not experiencing the fullness of what the Lord had intended for them. They took His name and presence for granted. Contextually, it’s hard to imagine. The people of Israel had already been exiled for this exact behavior: ignoring the Lord, following other gods, not taking His name seriously. But the Lord had restored them. They were home. And yet, again, they were falling back into the same sinful patterns.\n\nThe book of Malachi is unique, a set of prophecies written after the return to Israel. But its warnings feel deeply personal to me. Am I really living in the fullness of what the Lord intended? Do I go through the motions without feeling the cost of following Him? Am I taking His goodness, presence, and mercy for granted? \n\nI love how the sharply-wielded critique of a thousands-year-old prophet can cut me down to my knees. It’s the power of Scripture, the words of the holy Lord of Armies, reminding me that He alone is God, and His name will be feared among the nations. I’m thankful for that promise, and the reminder that the center of my universe is not me and my sad attempts at sacrifice, but rather the God who made it all.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nOh, Israel. \n\nWith the book of Malachi, we’ve reached the end of the Old Testament. For 38 books prior, we’ve seen the Israelites flounder. Malachi’s sharp wit pierces the stale narrative in new ways, but it’s the same old song. The Israelites turn away from God, marry foreign women, defile the sacrifices, and get called out for it. In today’s reading, the table is turned to the Levitical priests. \n\nThere is no loyalty in the heart of Israel, no fidelity to the God who made and called His people into relationship with Him. Malachi reminds them of the covenant God made with the line of Aaron, the first high priest sons of Aaron (the first high priest), were promised in Jeremiah 33 (a reminder of God’s covenant with David) that the “Levitical priests will never fail to have a man always before me” (v.18). \n\nThat reminder came before the exile, and God restored the Levitical priests to their stations after the Israelites returned home. But, as we read yesterday, they treated their role flippantly. “You have caused many to stumble by your instruction,” the Lord said in Malachi 2:8. This contrasts with how the Lord describes the role of the priest in the verse before: “For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should desire instruction from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the Lord of Armies.” \n\nIn the whole of Israel, the Levites were ordained as a special class: the priests. Their responsibility was great, but they failed over and over again. God needed a new covenant with His people, one dependent solely on Him. A covenant that would seal His people to Him forever, no matter their fickle hearts and minds. \n\nHebrews 8:7 reminds us, “For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second one.” It wasn’t faultess, because it depended on us. \n\nIn Matthew, the next book of the Bible and also the first of the New Testament, God sends His Son to be our Great High Priest, our Savior (Matthew 3:16–17; Hebrews 9:11–15). The new covenant through Christ would secure God’s promise to His people: “I will be their God, and they will be my people” (Hebrews 8:10). \n\nReading Malachi, like reading so many other books of the Old Testament, is not meant to be a discouragement, but rather, one of deep encouragement. God’s chosen people failed and still do. His special priests failed. But God Himself will never fail, and for that we give thanks.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI love to barbecue. Two or three times a year, I make pulled pork. It takes me three days, give or take: a wet brine, a dry rub, slow smoked on the grill, and then finished in the oven. The first bites of sweet-spicy bark are heavenly, a combination of loving preparation and long-suffering. \n\nWhen pork shoulder reaches approximately 160 degrees, it enters what is known as “the stall.” The stall can last hours and can be paralyzing for the barbecuer: the temperature gauge does not change. It sits at 160-ish degrees for hours and hours. The stall is a scientifically-studied phenomenon during which the melting fat in the meat leads the moisture in the meat to evaporate, which cools the meat. Basically, the fat is rendering and the meat is slowly, steadily becoming pure, tender deliciousness. The meat is being refined and purified by the heat. \n\nThe three disputations in today’s chapter in Malachi are about this very thing: the cost of refining. The Lord promises to send a messenger who will “be like a refiner’s fire and like launderer’s bleach” (Malachi 3:2). The messenger will “purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver. Then they will present offerings to the Lord in righteousness” (v.3). The messenger is dual: it refers to John the Baptist, who will prepare the way for Jesus, the messenger of the new covenant—the one who will go through the refining fire and be the refining fire for all of us.\n\nIn Malachi, we see the calling-out of the people and priests who tried to shortcut their way through the fire, or who claimed what they had already done and been through was enough. But the sacrifices were not about the animals, and the behavior modifications were not about performing just right, and the exile wasn’t a punishment that would wipe their sin away for good.\n\nProverbs 17:3 says, “A crucible for silver, and a smelter for gold, and the Lord is the tester of hearts.” Our hearts are just as in need of refining as the hearts of the wayward priests in the book of Malachi. Sanctification, the lifelong process of being made more like Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit, is often painful like fire as it burns away our sin. \n\n“No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it” (Hebrews 12:11). This training is hard. I can count a thousand ways the Lord is burning away the dross in my life today, and there will still be a lifetime of work to do. Asking for His refining love is the most daring and terrifying thing I can pray, but it is also the safest because of His sweet and abiding love for me.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI don’t know about you, but I’ve really enjoyed the deep dive into the book of Malachi this week. I’ve not ever read Malachi before (don’t tell my Old Testament professor!), or at least not in this sort of detail, and it’s quite the surprising and enjoyable little book tucked at the very end of the minor prophets. \n\nMalachi is a series of warnings and disputations between the Lord and His people, but there is a sharpness of wit and sarcasm that makes it stand apart from the other minor prophets. It’s a fitting end to the Old Testament, an exclamation point on the prophets that have scolded the Israelites and cried out for the Messiah. Malachi does both, though with less drama and weeping than some of the others. There are surprisingly irreverent moments, about wiping the faces of the priests with animal waste (Malachi 2:3), and others more lyrically poignant, like when Malachi describes the priests covering the Lord’s altar with tears (2:13). \n\nMalachi reminds us that the world is broken, and we are broken. Even God’s chosen people, armed with God’s precious covenants and blessings, led by the chosen Levites, have failed to sow seeds of goodness, justice, righteousness, and love. As go the Israelites, so go the rest of us: bought with the blood of Christ, but still tilling in rows of brokenness and waiting for the harvest. \n\nMalachi ends with a promise, a promise whose roots stretch all the way back to Genesis and all the way forward to Revelation. Wickedness and injustice will be no more, and those who fear the Lord will go out with joy. Goodness will be restored, and reinvented in a way that we cannot imagine how good it will be. \n\nRevelation 21 is true and beautiful, and it is such a gift to read it today alongside Malachi 4. “Nothing unclean will ever enter it,” John wrote about the new Jerusalem (Revelation 21:27). \n\nThe people to whom Malachi wrote thought that maybe they were living in the new Jerusalem, the rebuilt city after the long exile. But they weren’t, and their hearts were still shaped more by themselves than by God. \n\nThe day is coming when wickedness will burn like stubble. We still cling to the same promise the Israelites did, but our hope is anchored in the body and blood of Christ. The day is coming when the sun of righteousness will rise. Until then, may we live in joyful anticipation of the assured and blessed morning. \n\n",

Those who walked the streets with Jesus, who encountered His teaching in the synagogues, who witnessed Him healing the sick and eating with sinners—they were compelled to understand who this man was. That was 2,000 years ago. And here we are, asking the same question today.\n\nEven now, sitting in my Nashville office, surrounded by modern technology and Western comforts, I can think of no more foundational question to ask. The answer frames what I believe about God. It frames what I know about myself and how I view the world around me. And, on one hand, my response as a Christian is simple: Jesus is the Son of God. But because that is true, is there not infinitely more to know?\n\nTheologian Charles Hodge said, “The gospel is so simple that small children can understand it, and it is so profound that studies by the wisest theologians will never exhaust its riches.” I believe he’s right, and I believe the same is true with the central figure of that gospel, the person of Jesus Christ. We cannot exhaust the depth of Him, but we can know Him. \n\nThe Gospel of Matthew is a great place to start. \n\nBeginning with a genealogy, Matthew lays out his account of who Jesus is: the Messiah that the Jewish people—and the world—had been waiting for. He presents Jesus as the Son of God, born of the Holy Spirit, baptized by a prophet, and tempted by the devil. He shows Jesus as teacher, healer, servant, and friend—a man who walked the earth but was not bound by it. \n\nIn telling us who Jesus is, Matthew tells the story of our salvation. \n\nIt is a story written from the foundation of the world (Matthew 25:34). In these two chapters alone, our historian Matthew references five Old Testament prophecies fulfilled in Christ’s birth (1:22; 2:5, 15, 17, 23). He is Immanuel, “God with us,” the one who “will save his people from their sins” (1:23, 21). Jesus is not just part of this story—He is the story. \n\nI hope you’ll read along with us these next four weeks as we explore Matthew’s Gospel together and discover the true answers to that all-important question. Jesus is the Son of God. He is the Savior, the Christ, the Messiah. \n\nThis is the story Matthew tells. This is Jesus.\n\n",

While waiting for the exam, I looked at the framed diploma on the wall assuring me that this doctor had gone to medical school and successfully received her degree in ophthalmology. Can you imagine if instead of an ophthalmology degree hanging on the wall, it was a degree in something like culinary arts? I don’t want an eye doctor certified in making soufflés. I want an eye doctor certified in treating eyes. \n\nWhere someone’s authority comes from matters. It matters to us today, and it mattered to those present during the events recorded in Matthew’s Gospel.\n\nEveryone in the Galilee region was asking the same question: Who is Jesus? Some asked it aloud but probably all who came in contact with Him asked it to themselves. If Jesus was a rabbi or a prophet, that would have given Him some authority, but not authority over everything. However, if Jesus was the Son of God, that would give Him full authority. That would mean that everything He did was worth watching. Everything He said worth listening to and abiding by. \n\nThis is why the identification of Jesus in Matthew 3 is so pivotal to the gospel story. Present at Jesus’ baptism were those who were skeptical of Him, such as the Pharisees, as well as some who believed, such as John the Baptist. In front of them all, the Father answered everyone’s question: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased” (Matthew 3:17). \n\nThe declaration of Jesus’ authority mattered greatly that day. Jesus was beginning His ministry. He would go on to perform miracles and heal countless numbers of people. If He was doing so by any name other than the Father’s, if His miracles were performed through anyone other than the Holy Spirit, His authority during His ministry would be undermined, as well as the work that was done on the cross.\n\nAuthority matters. \n\nLater in chapter four, Satan tempts Jesus. What was Satan’s strategy? To question Jesus’ authority. You can’t turn this rock to bread…The angels don’t really answer to you…You are not actually in control of anything here. It’s the same strategy Satan uses to tempt us. He wants us to question Jesus’ authority, to look outside of Christ for guidance. To bow down to other idols. To look to fulfillment in other things. \n\nIf Jesus is not the authority in our lives, something else will be, someone else will be. \n\nScripture says the devil left Jesus when Jesus quoted these words from the law: “Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him” (Matthew 4:10). Satan knew he stood no chance against someone who was clear about the authority in His life. He stands no chance against us, if we are clear about the authority that is ours in Christ Jesus. \n\nWho is Jesus in your life? \n\nDoes He have authority? Is He the Son of God, or, when it comes down to it, is His role more that of a rabbi’s? A good teacher, but not the be-all-end-all? How we answer this question determines what or who has authority over our life. May it be the Son of God, and may we say with boldness today, “Him only do I serve.”  \n\n",

We clip our fighting short as we walk into the sanctuary; we can’t bring our pettiness into a holy place.\n\nIf only my day-to-day shenanigans really could be glossed over by washing my hair and putting clean trousers on the children every Sunday. If only our knack for welcoming visitors and taking communion would do the trick and show God how truly worthy we are.\n\nA few weeks ago, I stood in the sanctuary, hemmed in by my moderately clean children and propped up by my fashion-booties. We were singing hymns to the glory of God, and in the whirl of wrangling and worshiping I realized I was holding a child instead of the papers with the sheet music. Looking down, I saw that my papers lay under the delicately beautiful foot of an elderly woman on my left. You have to understand that I was in a hurry, wanting to keep on with the worshiping and the children and the swell of holiness.\n\nI had seen in the past magicians who could grab hold of one corner of a white tablecloth and quickly sweep it off a beautifully set table without disturbing the china or the candles that lay upon it. I had the idea that I could apply this same principle to my situation.\n\nKneeling down and holding the paper tightly in my fingers, I wish I had paused to consider that the success of the service doesn’t depend on me—we are the imperfect participants in a holy circus. Our antics are always going to be a little ridiculous. We try to do what is right, but still end up failing ridiculously, even at the moments when we should be at our very best.\n\nThe problem is that no amount of hand-waving hallelujahs, or giving of holy kisses, will make us what we ought to be. My own doings do not number me with the merciful, the peacemakers, or the pure in heart. It is tempting to think that by substituting my own Sunday morning showmanship, I can actually abolish the real law. But, as He stated in His Sermon on the Mount, Christ came to establish the law, and also to fulfill it (Matthew 5:17).\n\nAnd there is the answer: He fulfills it. Not me. He is the true peacemaker, the one who suffered for righteousness, the saltiness of the salt, the true light of the world. My antics, even at their highest and most “expert” level, are still filthy rags. Jesus laid it out for us, saying, “For I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven” (v. 20).\n\nAnd hallelujah to that. Those Pharisees worked harder than anybody at getting the holy hoedown exactly right, and even those perfectionists couldn’t do it. Thanks be to God that my salvation doesn’t depend on me.\n\nEven if I am careful, I can’t retrieve my worship folder without disturbing the ankle of a very elegant and elderly woman. But at the time, I didn’t think of all this, so I just gave it a sharp yank. We were both surprised and, I think, we were probably both a little disappointed in me. But then we sighed, raised our tambourine hands, and continued to worship. Our imperfection is written on our lips and our feet. But they are the tools we have, so we keep on worshiping.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:1-34, Matthew 7:1-29, 1 Chronicles 29:11-13, 1 John 2:28-29\n\nPull up a chair, girls. We’re going to have a conversation about intimacy. Yep—“husband and wife” intimacy. It may very well make you blush, but I promise to keep it PG, and I promise it’s all part of a very important point.\n\nThe Bible often refers to the Church as the Bride of Christ (2 Corinthians 11:2, Ephesians 5:22-33). Our relationship with Jesus is like a marriage—but in a perfect way. He makes us beautiful, then admires us as we walk down the aisle toward Him on our wedding day (Revelation 19:6-9). Perfectly pure. Impeccably white. Kind of awesome.\n\nSo now comes that part about intimacy.\n\nLet’s say, physically speaking, there are varying levels of intimacy. Those levels might begin with any sort of public display of affection and graduate all the way to the most intimate, behind-closed-doors, one-flesh moments meant to be shared only between a husband and wife. It’s really nobody’s business, and it’s deeply personal. A husband and wife are, indeed, one flesh. The intimate covenant they share, like Christ’s covenant with us, is sacred. \n\nWhen it comes to our relationship with God, it can be the same way. There’s PDA and then there’s sacred intimacy. There are grand public gestures of skywriting and singing telegrams (praying on the street corner “to be seen by people,” as Matthew put it in 6:5). And then there is knowing the love language of God: taking time in secret to show Him the only affections you’re chasing after are His. Pursuing Him privately, closing the doors, enjoying sacred intimacy.\n\nAny relationship that only goes as deep as public displays, or mere physical intimacy without an emotional bond and commitment, is not true intimacy. This is what Jesus warns the crowds about in Matthew 6:1, “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. Otherwise, you will have no reward with your Father in heaven.”\n\nJesus doesn’t want your love to be a spectacle. He wants it to be sacred. He wants you to seek Him and His kingdom first, before everything and everyone else (Matthew 6:33). \n\nIn a marriage—in any relationship that lasts past the honeymoon phase—intimacy takes intentionality. Sometimes it takes scheduling regular dates on the calendar, even committing to block out distractions and making space for, ahem, intimacy on a regular basis. Intimacy can be enjoyed organically, only when it is supported intentionally. Jesus told us this: “But when you pray, go into your private room, shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret” (Matthew 6:6).\n\nHow are you pursuing intimacy as the Bride of Christ? Are you intentionally closing the doors, scheduling dates, and setting aside time in order for your relationship to deepen? Or are you publically kissing Him, then living as strangers at home? Is your prayer life simply a spectacle, or is it spectacularly sacred?\n\nTo know Jesus personally is to be in loving relationship with Him, one where He longs to be gracious to us because He loves us (Isaiah 30:18). The God who calls us His treasured possession is also the greatest treasure our hearts will ever know (Deuteronomy 7:6; Matthew 6:21). The intimacy and acceptance we crave is waiting for us. \n\n“Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.”  -Matthew 7:7\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 8:1-34, 2 Samuel 22:16, Isaiah 53:4-5\n\nReading Matthew 8 reminds me of Sunday School. Every story—six of them in just 34 verses—is familiar, conjuring up memories of flannel boards and coloring pages from my elementary school days. Jesus heals a leper, He calms a storm, He casts out the demons into pigs … it’s like a WOW! That’s What We Call Miracles Greatest Hits compilation. If you grew up in the Church, you know these stories. \n\nWhen we know Bible stories like the back of our hand, we risk missing the miraculous. Perhaps more importantly though, we read them as just that—stories. But these stories are true. And more than true, they are promises. Each story is not just a historical event, something that Jesus did. Rather, they are glimpses of everything that Jesus will do. \n\nIn his book The Reason for God, Tim Keller writes:\n\nWe modern people think of miracles as the suspension of the natural order, but Jesus meant them to be the restoration of the natural order. The Bible tells us that God did not originally make the world to have disease, hunger, and death in it. Jesus has come to redeem where it is wrong and heal the world where it is broken. His miracles are not just proofs that he has power but also wonderful foretastes of what he is going to do with that power. Jesus’ miracles are not just a challenge to our minds, but a promise to our hearts, that the world we all want is coming.\n\nThe miracles of Matthew 8 are about people in a specific place and time. They are about a leper, a centurion and his servant, Peter’s mother-in-law, the disciples on an angry sea, and two men with demons. But each miracle is also about the Israelites who wandered and trusted the God who promised them that one day their King would come. Each miracle is about the Jews, torn away from Jerusalem, listening to Isaiah prophesy that a Messiah would come to take on their illnesses and bear their diseases. And each miracle is about us, with our mix of ancient faith and modern doubt. Each miracle proved to the Jewish people then and teaches us now that Jesus is who He says He is, that He fulfilled God’s promises, and that He will fulfill them again. \n\nI risk reading this passage purely at face value: people needed help, they asked Jesus, and He helped them, healing the dying and rescuing the scared disciples. In my own life, I am tempted to pray with the same expectation for earthly healing and immediate help. Every prayer is my own version of “calm the storm, Jesus!” But my own experience has taught me that Jesus doesn’t always work that way. Matthew is telling us that while Jesus can do all we could ever ask or imagine, He may not always answer our earthly needs in the way we think He should. Is it enough for me to know that the One who makes even the winds and sea obey Him will also makes everything new one day? (Matthew 8:27; Revelation 21:5).\n\nSo I continue to pray for miracles, yes. I pray with faithful expectation, and sometimes, with honest doubt. I live in the tension of the already and the not yet. \n\nGod has already fulfilled His promises, and we know that we can trust Him. But He has not yet fully restored His kingdom—what Keller called “the world we all want.” So we wait and pray, hope and trust. And we read these stories about Jesus, and take heart because we know they were true then, and they are just as true for us today.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 9:1-38, Numbers 19:11-21, Hosea 2:19-20\n\nI committed an embarrassing crime in my favorite pair of boots. With double-knotted laces and heels worn from hopscotch, those shoes supported me during some of my best moments, from resting on foot pedals during piano recitals to walking across the stage to accept awards for reading and attendance. They were impressive shoes for an equally impressive first grader, or so I thought.\n\nAnd then one day, I stepped off the school bus and sat at the kitchen table to begin my homework. From here, the details get a little foggy. All I know is that a light-hearted family conversation escalated to a hearty quarrel when I stood up, angrily seeking my next victim. Without my brain’s permission, my foot swung backward to gain momentum and forward to meet a target. I kicked a hole in my parents’ couch—not a small one, either.\n\nWhile my parents were certainly less than pleased, they soon realized this deed came with a built-in punishment. After the couch had to be moved down the stairs, out the door, and across town to be repaired, I would have to explain to any guests why we temporarily had no place for them to sit.\n\n“Oh, the couch? I broke it.”\n\nWhen I remember this story, I sometimes wonder if we’re all walking around with our own versions of kicked-in couches, whatever they may be, always aware of our brokenness.\n\nMy family? We’re struggling.\nMy job? It’s difficult.\nMy body? It’s hurting.\nMy heart? It’s suffering.\nMy circumstances? They’re unfair. \n\nIn Matthew 9, we find person after person in physical suffering, and yet, Jesus’ response to each one is very similar.\n\n“Have courage, your sins are forgiven” (v. 2).\n“Get up and walk” (v. 6).\n“Have courage, your faith has saved you” (v. 22).\n“Let it be done according to your faith” (v. 29). \n\nHere, Jesus isn’t telling us to brush ourselves off from the hurt; He is showing us what it means to be whole again. It’s more than the healing of our bodies, our families, or any other shattered piece we may be holding. True healing can only be found through forgiveness, and ultimately, through Jesus’ broken body and shed blood. He knew that “it is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are sick… For [He] didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners (Matthew 9:12-13).\n\nJesus calls out a truth that maybe we’re too afraid or wrapped up in our circumstances to admit: Broken lives require faith. We may not know what to do with broken pieces and messy circumstances, but He certainly knows what to do with the bold faith of His children. Jesus uses the broken pieces to draw us to His wholeness.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 10:1-42, Acts 1:13, James 2:1-7 \n\nHave you ever received a gift with no strings attached? Many of us may recall the joy of receiving Christmas presents as a child. When you’re young there are no expectations of repayment; the gift is freely given, and certainly, freely taken. \n\nDo you also know what it’s like to receive a gift with strings attached? Maybe you “won” a free night at the hotel in exchange for a timeshare meeting, or your friend loaned you their car with an unspoken debt to pay. It’s not so fun to receive a gift and find out later it wasn’t really free.  \n\nThe gift of salvation can only be received freely like a child. “Life to the fullest” is free to us because our generous God paid the price with His own Son (John 10:10). Not to mention, we couldn’t pay the fair value for such a precious present, even if we tried. “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).\n\nWhen Jesus sent out His twelve disciples for the first time, He warned them about the quid-pro-quo economy of the world (Matthew 10). Jesus was well aware that when you start healing people, driving out demons, or raising people from the dead, there will be loved ones willing and eager to compensate you. \n\nBut Jesus does not want people to believe they can buy God’s love or favor. The Lord doesn’t want you to confuse the gospel with a bait-and-switch timeshare meeting. Christ warned the disciples against the temptation to take those payments. He reminded them that they had received spiritual gifts without paying for them, so they should not charge others. “Freely you received, freely give,” He instructed them (Matthew 10:8).\n\nWe might not expect our neighbor or coworker to pay us money for our encouragement or service, but do we secretly expect them to pay us back with social favors or reciprocated acts? Are there spiritual gifts the Lord has given you that He wants you to spill out onto others lavishly? If you’ve been given the spiritual gift of encouragement, encourage others in the faith freely. If God has given you the spiritual gift of service, serve with a heart of generosity. \n\nEverything we have has been given to us. When we remember that our salvation, financial resources, and spiritual gifts are purely by the grace of God, we become stewards instead of hoarders. As followers of Christ sent into the world, we are given the same instructions as the twelve disciples. Give away the most valuable gift of God’s love at no charge, because that is how we all received it—freely.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 11:1-30, Isaiah 29:18-19, 1 John 5:3-4\n\nIt’s one of those moments so deeply seared onto my heart that I still glance at the memories and wince. I was in a Jamaican infirmary, tasked with offering some measure of comfort to the sick and dying housed there. Their beds were jammed together, packing every room. Conditions weren’t sanitary. Many patients wailed incessantly. My comfort-craving brain wanted to find the escape hatch, to look somewhere other than at the faces of these people I could do so little for. Maybe that’s why my eyes kept drifting out the windows at the sugary white sand and emerald blue Caribbean waters that sparkled just beyond the compound’s walls.\n\nThe juxtaposition of human sorrow and breathtaking beauty sticks with me still. Jesus was on the shore and in the suffering at the same time. We find a juxtaposition just as jarring in Matthew 11. \n\nJohn the Baptist was imprisoned for his faith, sitting on death row. Yet, Jesus was using John’s predicament as an object lesson for true discipleship when He delivered these comforting words:\n\n“Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls, For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (vv. 28-30). \n\nRest. Our bleary eyes and exhausted souls crave it, don’t they? And yet, John would remain in prison until his gruesome death. Humanly speaking, John’s yoke was not easy. His burden was not light. So, what did Jesus mean? \n\nI imagine John must have looked around his prison cell and felt tired from the weight of it all. He sent messengers to make sure Jesus had something better to offer (vv. 1-3). Our weary hearts often wonder the same thing, don’t they?\n\nJesus responds like this:\n\n“Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them” (vv. 4-5). \n\nRest from pain, suffering, and worry is certainly something we can all readily give our “Amen!” to. But then here comes that juxtaposition again—that same tension—when Jesus adds, “And blessed be the one who is not offended by me” (v. 6). \n\nWhen this world leaves me weary, I want to take a nap. But Jesus wants to give me a break from the tyranny of self. If the kind of rest Christ offers doesn’t look like I think it will, He must be promising so much more. \n\nIf a good night’s sleep and an easy life was all Jesus had to give John, it would not have been enough to keep him chained to Christ. John would die for his faith—not for a handful of miracles that had already happened, but for a tsunami of healing that was to come. Somewhere along the way, John must’ve resolved that the rest he needed most was not circumstantial. \n\nWe are all broken by sin, longing for a cure. Jesus walks among us, removing the yoke of sin that bends our backs and breaks our hearts. Suffering and sleeplessness may remain temporarily, but the burden of sin is no longer ours to carry. Jesus took that burden so we could know the kind of rest that seeps past our bones and into our weary souls.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 12:1-50, Leviticus 19:9-10, Isaiah 42:1-4\n\nRecently, at a dinner with friends, I noticed the person sitting next to me skip the pork tenderloin and serve himself an extra spoonful of brussels sprouts. This made no sense to me.\n\n“Are you a vegetarian?” I asked, hoping to avoid a pitch to join the fold. (I love meat.) \n\n“Oh no,” he said. “I’m just taking a break. We went paleo for a long time and I kind of went overboard.”\n\nI laughed. Sure enough, a few years ago my husband and I decided to go Paleo too. This was before the “Whole 30” eating plan was a thing. We were simply trying to do something different with our diet, and quickly learned how easy it was to make a meal out of veggies and protein. But it was also easy to use the “Paleo” rules to fill our plates with nothing but pork, bacon, and ground beef.\n\nIt’s easy to follow the rules but ignore the spirit and intent behind them.\n\nThat’s the heart of Matthew 12. At this time in history, Pharisees were a group of devout Jewish men who had tried to keep every letter of the law. Scribes, mentioned later in the passage, were essentially lawyers—men who copied and interpreted the law of Moses for the people. Both groups knew the rules inside and out. And sure enough, they were right about the rules.\n\nIn the book of Leviticus, the Lord instructs His people not to strip the farmland bare, but to leave the final portion to the poor and to immigrants. In fact, in the book of Ruth, we see Ruth, a poor, barren immigrant woman, benefitting from that compassionate law, as she gathers grain from Boaz’s field. But intent on proving Jesus to be a hypocrite, the Pharisees point out that He was breaking two laws: the harvesting laws and the laws prohibiting work on the Sabbath.\n\nI can almost see their self-satisfied smiles as they imagine Jesus stuttering to respond. But He doesn’t miss a beat. He says He is Lord of the Sabbath because He created it (vv. 6-8). He defined rest.\n\nAnd yet, the Pharisees continue to press. Entering the temple, they point to a crippled man and ask Jesus a theoretical question, as if they can stump Him with a bit of moral philosophy. In order to accuse Him, they asked, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?” (v. 9).\n\nAre you kidding me? How prideful! How arrogant! As if they wanted to go around healing crippled people, but the Sabbath was all that was stopping them? If I were Jesus, I would have yelled, “You Pharisees couldn’t heal whether it was on the Sabbath or not! Shut your traps!”\n\nBut thankfully, Jesus is not me.\n\nHe doesn’t answer them while screaming and shouting like I would have. Instead, He exposes their hearts with a simple story that even a child could understand, making the truth abundantly clear: There is no prohibition against mercy. Only He can heal, and only He determines when to do it.\n\nScribes and Pharisees dole out burdens and rules and loopholes and philosophical arguments. Jesus delivers hope. May we put our trust in His name alone.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Jesus Speaks in Parables",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 13:1-52, 1 Corinthians 5:6-7\n\nUntil last year, I had never seen the movie Star Wars. This was the cinematic equivalent of blasphemy for my in-laws, my friends—pretty much everyone else in the world, really. Star Wars is part of our cultural lexicon, but when you’ve never seen it, most references to it go unnoticed. It’s as if fans of the film franchise speak another language when they talk about it. Sure, I was familiar with the line, “Luke, I am your father,” but anything more than that, and I was totally lost. I’d heard about Star Wars a lot, but I’d never understood the context of what I was hearing. And I certainly couldn’t contribute to the conversation. \n\nWhen Jesus taught in parables, He was speaking to two audiences. Some, like His disciples, understood what He was teaching. And if they didn’t understand, they would ask Jesus to explain. Others belonged to the “you will hear but never understand” camp (Matthew 13:14). Much like being a part of a conversation about a movie you’ve never seen or a book you’ve never read, the latter audience could tune out Jesus’ message. \n\nJesus knew that by speaking in parables, His message would get through to the right people—the people who would open their hearts to Him and who would work to see the kingdom of God flourish. He also knew that the people who were out to get Him (the Pharisees, the Romans) would not understand the parables, and so to some degree, parables were a protective measure. \n\nReading the parable of the sower, I wonder where I land on the spectrum of listeners. As Jesus sows the seeds of His message, how receptive are my heart and mind? Do I have a hard heart and closed eyes when I read Scripture? Do I read the difficult parts with the same rigor and delight as I do the easier passages? Do I cling to the Jesus who heals and pardons, and shy away from the Jesus who turns over tables and calls out sinners? Do I let the double-edged sword of Scripture do its good, sanctifying work in me? \n\nEugene Peterson wrote it this way in The Message: “They stick their fingers in their ears so they won’t have to listen; They screw their eyes shut so they won’t have to look, so they won’t have to deal with me face-to-face and let me heal them” (Matthew 13:15).\n\nI know my heart is rocky and full of weeds that choke out the Word. The parable of the sower exposes my idols, holding them up to the light of Jesus’ message about the kingdom of God, about the freedom and peace He, and He alone, brings. But I am tempted to fall away when trials come, turning to my own strength instead of the Word of God. I chase the material, the next-best, and the greener grass, instead of running relentlessly after Jesus alone. My faith is weak, even when I long for it to somehow be enough. \n\nThe remedy for my fallow heart is the Word. \n\nThe Apostle Paul tells us that “faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ” (Romans 10:17). May it be so with us. May we be eager listeners with hearts rich with fertile ground, anxious know His teaching, and ready to whatever He asks of us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 13:53-58, Matthew 14:1-36, Deuteronomy 8:3, Isaiah 43:10-13\n\n“Have courage! It is I.”\n\nWhen we read these words in Matthew 14:27, from the viewpoint of our modern context, it’s easy to miss their significance. It’s easy to dismiss them as a much needed encouragement, and little more. The disciples, after all, are frightened. They are stranded in a boat, far from shore, their vessel “buffeted by the waves.” Jesus “goes out to them,” walking across the water, which only stokes their fears more (vv.24-25).\n\nTo calm their anxieties, Jesus says, “It is I,” clarifying who He is. And immediately, Peter recognizes his teacher. \n\nThe climax of the story would seem to come later, when Peter joins Jesus in the waves. But the truth is, this verse is a bombshell. Jesus is making a statement of cosmic proportions, so it’s important not to miss what is happening. \n\nIn these five short words, Jesus is not merely identifying Himself, not in the usual way. This statement is not like announcing yourself at your parents’ back door: “It’s me! Just popping by!” Instead Jesus is making a monumental claim, one that Matthew’s Jewish listeners certainly would have noticed. Jesus is not just identifying Himself as the man they know and love. He is identifying Himself as God.\n\n“It is I”—translated from the Greek words ego eimi, which literally means “I am”—is a clear reference to an Old Testament story. Thousands of years earlier, God identified Himself to Moses in exactly the same way (Exodus 3:14). Theologian Stanley Hauerwas explains, “Just as God names himself to Moses in the burning bush, Jesus identifies himself as ‘I am.’ This is the ‘I am’ of Psalm 77:19, the ‘I am” who provides a way through the sea, a path though the mighty waters.”  \n\nIn other words, Jesus isn’t simply identifying Himself in the midst of the storm; He is identifying His place in human history. Jesus is not just another prophet. He is not just another priest. He is not just another rescuer. He is not just another king. Jesus is no ordinary “good person” who loves God and happens to know a lot about Scripture. Jesus is God Himself, the God who delivered the Israelites and parted the Red Sea. He is the God who is more than able to command the threatening waves below Him.\n\nIt’s an audacious claim, blasphemous even, had it not been true. And it’s a claim that continues to assert its power over our storms today, promising that Jesus is not simply with us, but as God of the universe He is reigning over all creation. We are guaranteed both the intimate presence of the Son, and the almighty authority of the Father. \n\nBoth then and now, we have this comfort and this truth. Jesus is not just our teacher, not just a good example, and not just a friend. Instead He declares, “It is I”:\n\nI am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I am the God of Moses—the God who heard my people cry, and delivered them. I am the God who sees, who knows, and who cares. I am capable and faithful, steady and good. I am not the God who was, or the God who will be; I am the God who is—unchanging, unshakeable, unfailingly compassionate and near.\n\nAnd I, Jesus, have another name: I AM.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 15:1-39, Matthew 16:1-28, Zechariah 12:10, 2 Peter 1:16-18\n\nI am very good at proclaiming things:\n\nI’m going to run a marathon!\nI’m going to take music lessons!\nI’m going to write one poem a day!\n\nBut these are things that are easier said than done; therefore, I say them, but do not really do them. I ran a half marathon, not a full. I took voice lessons for a few weeks, then quit. I wrote about six poems—over the course of an entire year.\n\nDeclarations are good, but in order to follow through with them we must understand their implications. \n\nIn Matthew 16, Jesus asks His followers, “Who do you say that I am?” And Peter has the right answer: “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God!” he declares (vv. 15-16). \n\nBut just a few verses later, we see that Peter doesn’t fully understand the implications of his declaration. When Jesus explains to His disciples what will eventually happen to Him in Jerusalem, that He will suffer on the cross, Peter is upset. “Oh no, Lord!” he says, “This will never happen to you!” (v. 22). \n\nAs my IVP Bible Background Commentary notes, “Peter had divulged Jesus’ secret identity yet had retained a faulty concept of what that identity entailed.” In other words, it’s one thing to say Jesus is the Messiah; it’s another to understand the implications this has on our lives. \n\nJesus proceeds to very clearly explain what it means to believe He is the Messiah, saying, “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me” (v. 24). Three things: deny yourself, take up your cross, follow Jesus. For those of you who’ve been on this Christian journey for a while, you might be thinking what I’m thinking: Easier said than done. \n\nAll three of these commands are incredibly counterintuitive to our sin nature. “Deny yourself” implies denying your selfish desires, ambitions, and needs. “Take up your cross” implies being prepared for the ridicule and scorn of others, even being prepared for death itself. “Follow me” implies allowing Jesus to be Lord of your life, laying down your control, and giving it to Him. \n\nI can declare that Jesus is the Messiah all day long, but do my actions reflect that I truly believe this? Have I denied myself today? Am I more concerned with what others think than I am with openly being a Christ follower? Am I allowing Jesus to control my life, or am I still gripping the wheel?\n\nBacking up a little in this passage we see that Jesus first asked His disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” (v. 13). He wanted to know what the disciples had observed others were saying about Him. Then He asks, “But you… who do you say that I am?” (v. 15). To me, it feels like the emphasis is on that second question. Jesus is more concerned with who His followers believe Him to be than what other men are saying about Him. \n\nWho we, as Christ followers, proclaim Jesus to be is critical for the world that is looking on. And how we act—much more than what we say—reflects whether or not we believe Jesus is the Messiah. \n\nWe can say and not do, proclaiming Jesus is the Messiah but never denying ourselves, never actually following Him. Or, through the power of Christ in us, we can proclaim and do, showing those around us who Jesus is. Pointing them to Him with our lives. Pointing them to the true Messiah.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 17:1-27, Matthew 18:1-35, 1 Kings 8:10-13, Jeremiah 23:1-4\n\n“Lord,” he said, “have mercy.”\n\nThis was the plea of a father made on behalf of his demon-possessed son. It is a request we have all cried out at one time or another, in different languages and circumstances. In big and small ways, we are constantly asking for mercy from the Lord and from each other. \n\nGive us more time!\nHelp us find her!\nDon’t lay me down for a nap!\n(And as the years pass…) Please, just let me rest!\n\nWhen Jesus healed the demon-possessed boy, His disciples gathered around to understand why they’d been unable to work the miracle themselves. \n\n“Because of your little faith,” he told them. “For truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed… nothing will be impossible for you” (Matthew 17:20).\n\nThe disciples were unable to give this man and his son the mercy they needed because their own faith was so small. While the disciples couldn’t heal the boy or cast out the demon, Jesus could. In fact, earlier in this chapter, the mere radiance of His glory sent them falling to the ground in terror (v. 5). Indeed, Jesus is set apart by His glory.\n\nAlthough there are certainly other times in Scripture when the disciples were able to perform miracles, this case is especially interesting because the man specifically asked for mercy, and the disciples were unable to give it. Later, in chapter 18, Jesus shared the parable of a servant who owes his master a huge sum—a sum so huge that he would need several lifetimes to pay it back. But then that servant turns around and finds somebody who owes him a couple of nickels, and starts choking him to give back his money (vv. 23-28).\n\nAlthough we don’t literally put our hands around the throats of those who owe us something, we do choke others with our lack of mercy and forgiveness. There is a great chasm of difference between God’s mercy and ours, between God’s faithfulness and our faithlessness, between God’s glory and our need. Jesus’ parable forces me to look at the truth: Even when I actually want to be merciful and forgiving, in my own strength, my best efforts prove my ability to forgive is forever lacking.\n\nThe vastness of God’s never-ending mercy shows us our need for forgiveness is enormous. Grasping that need is the first step to understanding the gospel. \n\nIt’s difficult to remember mercy when someone hurts us. Some of us have been hurt so badly it feels like everything is ruined, that nothing can restore what’s been taken from us. The very thought of the offense can fill us with fear and loathing. But we do well to remember this: In order to forgive us, Christ had to die for us. He took the curse that we brought to Him and gave up everything, so He could give us mercy (Galatians 3:13). This is staggering.\n\nTrue forgiveness costs everything. But God loves us so much, He freely gave everything. While this passage does remind us that we are like the unforgiving slave, the bigger truth here is that God is our compassionate Master, and He piles love and forgiveness on us all.\n\nThe gospel is true! God’s great love and mercy for us are greater than all our sins.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 19:1-30, Matthew 20:1-34, Deuteronomy 6:4, 2 Peter 3:10-13\n\nI am very hopeful that my one-day husband’s last name will begin with a letter in the first half of the alphabet. You see, while I love my last name with my whole heart, it begins with a “W,” which means the line for almost anything ends with me.\n\nDuring college graduation, I imagine that my friends whose last names fall at the beginning of the alphabet —Austin, Brock, and Chapman—were all halfway through their family celebration dinners before it was my turn to walk across the stage. I have very big ideas about what it would mean to be first in line.\n\nGetting ahead is the name of the human game. We want nothing more than to be picked first for the kickball team, secure the best seats at the movie theater, win the affection of our coworkers, achieve financial success, and ensure our security and worth at every turn.\n\nSo in Matthew 19, when Jesus says, “Many who are first will be last, and the last first” (v. 30), it may be our first instinct to picture a world where the underdog wins the game of getting ahead—the least athletic kid gets picked first for kickball, and those without savings accounts win the lottery. This is the illustration Jesus gives us, but its main purpose is to point to something even greater: His own measure of success.\n\nGod’s goal isn’t helping us to get ahead—it’s helping us get to Him. His redemption does not work within the constraints of the world’s standards, but within the bounds of eternity.\n\nIn the parable of the vineyard workers in Matthew 20, the workers hired at the beginning of the day are angry by the end of it. They are complaining because the other workers—hired hands just as they were—had done nothing, yet had been made equal to them. None of the workers were underpaid or overworked. Some of them had just experienced “undeserved” kindness, leaving others to feel less superior.\n\nAt least, that’s how it looks from our perspective. But these aren’t just rules and concepts Jesus wants us to unlearn from the ways of the world. Christ is showing us that His kingdom is wholly better. In it, we will be fully loved by Him, forever united. This is the message that all of Jesus’ teachings in these passages point to: unity over divorce, children inheriting the kingdom, poor over rich, last before first. Jesus came to serve the undeserving with kindness; this is the heart of God’s economy.\n\nAs Tim Keller says, “The gospel is this: We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than we ever dared to believe, yet at the very same time we are more loved and accepted in Jesus Christ than we ever dared hope.”\n\nKnowing all our earthly measures are off, let us look to Him, for we are worse and He is better than we could ever guess. May our deepest goal and desire be to find ourselves not first or last, but close to Him. Amen.\n\n",

The hosanna-shouters must have been shocked to see the man on the donkey driving the sellers out of the temple with such authority. “My house will be called a house of prayer,” Jesus said to them. “But you are making it a den of thieves!” (Matthew 21:13).\n\nBut it’s what He did next that was truly radical: He invited the least inside. \n\nThe blind, the lame, the children all came in and Jesus welcomed them, healed them, confirmed their place among Him (vv. 14-15). He cleared out those who had profaned the temple and ushered in those who humbly sought after God. \n\nWhen I picture the scene I can see myself in the wings, on the outside looking in. I am nervous, I am afraid, but I am drawn to this house of God, and so I watch and wait. Those inside seem to have it together, bringing riches rather than sacrifice, doing religion like a business. All I have is this humble offering in my hands, carried the long journey from my home, over rocky roads and mistake-laden miles. \n\nThen I see Him. And right before my eyes I watch Him turn it on its side, all the pretension and injustice and darkness that kept me at bay. He sends out those who’ve come not for God but for gods. \n\nAnd then? He looks me in the eye. Me. Lame, frightened, filthy from days of travel. He looks at me and sees me. He motions for me to come in and then He tells me I belong. \n\nI had cried out “Hosanna! Save me!” not knowing what I was really asking. And He rode on through the streets and into the city, knowing exactly what was coming. He would soon die, but not before He cleansed His house of prayer and invited me in. \n\nThis is our Christ! “The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone” (v. 42). He welcomes in the defenseless, becoming their defense. He brings the weak to Himself and makes them strong. He desires not the shiny sacrifices our pride wishes to bring, but only a heart that is stayed on Him. He saves us when we call out to Him.\n\nOnly He knows what our hearts truly need as we cry out, “Hosanna!” He knew it even then.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 22:1-46, Psalm 110, Hebrews 10:11-14\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I really do love my job, but I am not a morning person. Just the other day, I woke to the sound of my phone’s beeping alarm. Ugh. That was my first response. But as my feet hit the ground, something seemed off. Oh, that’s right. It’s Saturday, isn’t it?\n\nIt’s sad but true: I’ve been known to get so caught up in the daily grind that I’ve forgotten about the glory and goodness of the coming weekend. \n\nThe Sadducees didn’t just forget about the good news; they completely denied the possibility of life after death. Anyone remember singing at Vacation Bible School, “I don’t want to be a Sadducee, because they’re so sad you see”? Well, the reason they were “sad” is because their sect of Judaism had no hope for bodily resurrection. The Sadducees wanted to make the idea of the resurrection look ridiculous, and Matthew 22 recounts their attempt to trap the Messiah with a trick question.  \n\nHow did Jesus respond to their attempts at trickery? He lovingly responded to them in their own language, and then offered them a challenge. Because the Sadducees esteemed Moses over all others, Jesus quoted what Moses had to say about the resurrection. When God appeared to Moses in the burning bush, He said, “I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob” (Exodus 3:6). The Lord used the present tense—“I am,” not “I was.” \n\n“He is not the God of the dead, but of the living” (Matthew 22:32). Jesus confirms that Abraham is living, Isaac is living, Jacob is living. There is life after death. Hallelujah!\n\nIt’s easy for us to judge the Sadducees’ unbelief because we have the full and complete gospel in mind. We know that Jesus went down to the grave and rose again. Still, while we might not outright deny the resurrection, do we sometimes forget about it? It’s easy to get so focused on our everyday lives that we lose sight of our heavenly future. We live in fear, cling to earthly security, and fight for status. We may not deny the resurrection with our tongues, but we do with our thoughts and actions. \n\nChrist’s response to the Sadducees is a response for all of us. The Lord understands where you’re coming from and wants to lovingly speak to you about what’s to come. He knows exactly what makes you forget the eternal hope—whether you’re struggling with anxiety, exhausted by caring for children, distracted by work, or any number of other things. He gets it, but He doesn’t leave us there. He gives us true hope. \n\nJesus also challenged the Sadducees to know Scripture better. Could the same be said for us? When we lose sight of the good news, let’s fill our minds with the truth of God’s Word and open our ears to the Lord who speaks to us. May we delve into our Bibles for wisdom from above and hold fast to the living hope of the resurrection.\n\n“Because of his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you.” -1 Peter 1:3-4\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 23:1-39, Exodus 10:21-23, Romans 8:22-23\n\nToday’s passage is a doozy. In Matthew 23, Jesus holds nothing back, saving His harshest, sternest rebuke for two groups. \n\nFirst were the prideful Pharisees, who piled unnecessary burden onto the people. Rather than seeing God’s law as His love, the Pharisees used it as a weapon of position and power. Second were the sidelined scribes. They knew the law, but refused to speak up against the Pharisees’ hypocrisy, and therefore, became a part of the problem themselves. Fearful of the Pharisees’ power, the scribes kept silent, allowing the Pharisees’ perverted message to flourish. They could’ve been a voice for truth, but instead stood by and allowed the Pharisees to abuse the people.  \n\nJesus strongly condemned the Pharisees and scribes—but why?\n\nJesus saw their passion for position. The Pharisees were obsessed with increasing their own authority. They cared a lot about titles, requiring people to call them “Teacher,” “Master,” or “Father,” and racked up converts—not for the benefit of others’ souls, but for the sake of showing the power of their sect. They exalted themselves with false humility, and Jesus saw right through it. \n\nThe Pharisees perverted the Lord’s priorities. They were strict and precise when it came to small matters within the law, while being careless and loose about the things that mattered most. They pointed out small flaws in others while ignoring pervasive sin in their own hearts.\n\nJesus condemned the powerlessness of the Pharisees’ prescriptions. In their position of influence, Pharisees and scribes could have pointed people to deeper relationship with the Lord. Instead, they paved a road that led to destruction.\n\nThe Pharisees were preoccupied with perception. They cared deeply about what other people thought of them, wanting to be followed, trusted, honored, and revered. More concerned with their outward appearance than substance, they dressed to impress. In Deuteronomy, the Lord told His people to impress His commandments on their hearts, to “tie them on your hands and bind them on your foreheads” (6:8). Jews took that literally. During times of prayer, they tied small leather boxes called phylacteries onto their foreheads with Scripture verses hidden inside. The Pharisees made their phylacteries as large as possible, as if to say, “Look at how much Scripture I can carry on my forehead! More than you!”  \n\nBut does it really matter how beautiful you look on the outside, if you’re dying on the inside? Does it matter how beautiful the stone is, when all it marks is a grave?\n\nThe Pharisees were persistent in pride. They allowed themselves to carry on in the sin of their day, while still convinced they would’ve opposed the sins of their fathers. Jesus exposes their hypocrisy and self-deception under the microscope of truth. But the rebukes we hear in Matthew 23 aren’t angry rants—they are woes. Jesus feels deep anguish for the Pharisees and scribes, and for the people they are leading astray, to death. He isn’t smug. He’s not pointing fingers. He’s begging them to see the light. \n\nI imagine Jesus’ heart tearing in two as He speaks to them, longing for them to hear and receive the truth. He knows these are the very men whose hardened hearts will soon cry out, “Crucify!” These men and their pride, their empty passions—they will soon lead Jesus to the cross. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 24:1-51, Matthew 25:1-46, Daniel 7:13-14\n\nRather than organizing our lives into a zillion little categories like family and finances, work and leisure, God’s Word invites us to adopt a new filing system. Everything ultimately fits into one of only two categories: former things, which are destined to pass away, and forever things, which never will. There is no third option. \n\nIn language that feels equal parts inspiring and terrifying, Jesus reminds us to consider forever things here in Matthew 24 and 25. While the gravitational pull of our hearts is to spend our time thinking about the days on our calendar, Christ reminds us that a Day is coming soon that will forever sever our ties to the temporary.\n\n“Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with aloud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one of heaven to the other” (Matthew 24:30-31). \n\nWhen Christ returns a second time, the former things will be no more, and only forever things will remain. It’s a promise so spectacular our hearts can’t seem to absorb it. Jesus knows our tendency is to drop our eyes toward our navels rather than straining them heavenward, waiting for His return. In a parable designed to teach us how to wait well, He compares the Church to ten virgins waiting for their bridegroom. Five came prepared to wait as long as necessary. Five were foolish and did not (Matthew 25:1-12).\n\nJust like Jesus’ disciples who slept instead of standing guard with Him in the garden the night before He died, we are the sleepy virgins, prone to to become weary and distracted as we wait. But our Groom is coming. He’s already on His way. There’s still time to shift our focus away from bills and brokenness and toward our coming King. And while we do not know either the day or the hour, we do know that He’s called us to be alert and ready, waiting for Him with expectant hope of His return (v. 13). \n\nIn Revelation 21 we’re given a glimpse of what life will be like after Jesus rides in on the clouds. Jesus says, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God” (v. 3). Christ is coming back to save the Bride whose ransom He’s already paid. Our long separation from Him will finally come to an end. What then?\n\n“He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away” (v. 4, emphasis mine). Death, mourning, crying, pain—these will all become former things. As Christ teaches about His return, we find that it’s not that temporal things don’t matter, but a time is coming when they won’t. Jesus is coming back for us. On the timeline of eternity, it won’t be long now. May He find us waiting well.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 26:1-75, Leviticus 23:5-6, Isaiah 53:7, Jeremiah 31:31\n\n“What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?” (Matthew 26:15).\n\nThis historical record of Jesus Christ contains some of the most chilling sentences in all of literature and history. In this chapter of Matthew 26, we follow Christ through His final days and hours and watch, blow by agonizing blow, how He gives His life away in little pieces, even before He gasps His last breath on Golgotha. Judas plays his role, but Christ handed Himself over.\n\nWhat did it look like for Christ to give His life, while He still breathed, as He willingly walked to His death? He gives it away in so many big and small ways in this chapter alone, that I don’t have space here to touch on each. (If you can, take time to circle all the ways you see Christ giving away His life in these verses.) But we can look at a few here together.\n\nWithin the first two verses of the chapter, Jesus tells His disciples the exact day He will die. He specifies that it will happen in two days’ time. We don’t have a record here of their response, but judging from their other responses in Scripture, disbelief is a fair guess. Jesus gives His life by declaring His intention to do so.\n\nHe then allows the woman to prepare His body for burial. He defends her extravagance and celebrates her for seeing a small part of the truth of what would happen to Him, declaring her actions as noble (vv. 6-13). He knows what is coming, yet He doesn’t run from it. Jesus gives His life by preparing for His own burial.\n\nWhile He shares His final meal with the disciples, Jesus distresses His disciples by saying, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me” (v. 21). He suffers one of the deepest human sorrows: betrayal by a friend. In spite of their protestations, His disciples continue to betray Him as they fall asleep (vv. 36-46), desert Him (v. 56), and deny Him (vv. 69-75). Jesus gives His life by suffering betrayal.\n\nIn all these little ways and more, Jesus gave up His life for us. He suffered the whole gamut of human pain from heartbreak to torture. Reading all of this horror would feel gratuitous, except this is the narrative of our own happy ending. Because of Jesus’ thousand tiny deaths, and one literal death, we can live. We not only live, but we get to live happily ever after, with Him. This harrowing history is the key. He slayed the dragon of death and sin, and we can live in grateful joy for His precious sacrifice.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 27:1-66, Matthew 28:1-20, Psalm 22:7-8, 1 Corinthians 15:6, 2 Corinthians 3:18\n\nMy parents like to tell this story about me as a three-year-old.\n\nMy sister and I had a babysitter for the night, and my mom had made us brownies to have as a snack, with the instruction that we were each allowed one brownie. After the first brownie, I reached for a second. \n\n“No, Andrea,” said the babysitter. “You can only have one.” I looked at her, and with a scrunched up face and my hands on my hips, I declared, “You’re not the boss!” At the time, I had a speech impediment that softened my “R”s. So you can imagine how intimidating this sounded to my babysitter.\n\nI still have authority issues. Authority threatens my freedom. It says I am not in charge, not the boss of my own life. Yet, as Christians, we aren’t meant to live under the authority of our own rule. We have a King!\n\nThe Kingship of Jesus is highlighted in Matthew’s account of the crucifixion and resurrection. It was a Roman custom to name the crime of the offender on a plaque and place it above the criminal’s head as He hung on the cross. Because Pilate said Jesus had committed no real crime, he ordered this inscription instead:\n\n“This is Jesus, the King of the Jews” (Matthew 27:37).\n\nIt was a label given in contempt that could not have been more correct. \n\nScripture tells us Jesus is not only King of the Jews, but He is the King. As Revelation 19:16 says, “he has a name written on his robe on his thigh: King of Kings and LORD of Lords.” Still, I more often refer to Jesus as my Savior rather than my King. Charles Spurgeon says this is our tendency: “Men might be willing for Christ to save them, but not for Him to reign over them.”\n\nAcknowledging that Jesus reigns over me means acknowledging that I am not in control. But His kingship also means He is involved in the everyday—that His sovereignty covers even the nitty gritty of life. There is accountability that says we are called to a new, gospel way of living, and there is grace that says we aren’t doing this on our own. Both threaten our autonomy. \n\nSo we have to ask ourselves: Who’s the boss here? Me or Jesus?\n\nWhen we bow to Jesus as our King, we receive what we are most afraid of losing in the face of authority: freedom. Real freedom. \n\n“So if the Son sets you free, you really will be free” (John 8:36). \n\nThat’s the type of freedom I want. Not the kind that creates the illusion of my own control, but the kind that comes with the cross. The kind that comes with surrendering to the power that conquered death forever and rose victorious from the grave. \n\nThis is Jesus. He is the Son of God, the King of the Jews, the Savior of the world—and He is also the King of me. \n\nThe angel told the women, “Don’t be afraid, because I know you are looking for Jesus who was crucified. He is not here. For he has risen, just as he said.” -Matthew 28:5-6\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Mark 1, Nahum 1:15, Malachi 3:1\n\nI sometimes study best with a pen in hand. \n\nThere’s probably some scientific reason to explain the powerful connection between our hands and head as they interact with the same thing—or maybe I just made that up. Either way, it totally works for me. When I really want to learn something, I use a pen to help me make a visual map of the text I’m reading. The book of Mark calls for pen-in-hand reading; there’s a lot going on and it all happens very quickly.\n\nThe apostle Luke spends the first two chapters of his Gospel beautifully telling the story of the expectation and arrival of the baby Jesus. Matthew walks us through one long (and super important!) genealogy of Christ before any real narrative begins. And John takes time to establish Jesus as the Word who was with God and is God. All wonderful stuff, critical to the canon.\n\nMark, on the other hand, hits the ground running. And really, he never stops. Heavy on directional language and light on details, the first chapter alone includes at least ten significant plot points, all connected with words like “immediately” and “right away,” as we whiplash into yet another important scene. (You know I marked every one of them with my trusty pen. Pun intended.)\n\nNow, I’m not accusing Mark of writing like he’s running out of time, but there is an efficiency to his message that tells me there’s no time to spare. The gospel is urgent, and there is much Mark wants his readers to know about the Christ he loves and follows.\n\nStill, amid the rapid-fire storyline of the first chapter of Mark, the moments of stillness have a way of standing out. (And yes, I marked these too.) Juxtaposing all the noisy action on the page, Jesus retreats to the wilderness (v. 12), silences an unclean spirit (v. 25), does not permit the demons to speak (v. 34), goes away to a deserted place to pray (v. 35), tells the healed man to keep quiet (v. 43), and ultimately begins preaching in deserted places (v. 45). This many instances of quiet become too loud to ignore on a page with so much activity.\n\nMark doesn’t waste any extra words saying what he wants us to know. From the very first line, he gets straight to the point: Jesus is “the Son of God” (v. 1). Later, God Himself addresses Jesus as His “beloved Son” (v. 11), and even the unclean spirit says to Jesus, “I know who You are—the Holy One of God!” (v. 24). According to Mark’s Gospel, Jesus’ divinity is non-negotiable. \n\nYou can see why the book of Mark appeals to me as a student of the Word. But that doesn’t keep it from being tender to my heart as well. “This is why I have come,” Jesus tells His disciples (v. 38). Not to be flashy, not to draw big crowds, but to preach the gospel with a contagious holiness that could drive out demons and heal the unclean. Yes, there is a lot of action, but the message is simple, spoken from the lips of Christ Himself: “Repent and believe in the good news!” (v.15).\n\nAs we embark on this journey into another exciting book of the Bible, let’s take out our pens, connecting our hands to our heads. Let’s pay attention to the inspired, intentional way this very unique book was written. But let’s not forget to also lay our pens down and engage our hearts, remembering Christ’s simple call to “repent and believe” that the gospel is true—that it is good news, and it is for all of us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebekah Lyons\n\nText: Mark 2:1-28, Mark 3:1-35, Hebrews 2:11-12\n\nI’m a fan of doctors, of their life-saving work. I’m not a fan of being the patient. \n\nI can always find a reason to avoid a visit. I’ll let an ailment linger for days, aiming to kick it with a home remedy or just some good ol’ fashioned pain tolerance. But a couple years ago, while living in downtown Manhattan, I couldn’t shake or will away an overwhelming, inexplicable illness. After writhing in pain for three days straight, common sense kicked in; I hailed a cab at midnight and headed to urgent care.\n\nDesperation will do this, when denial inevitably falls short.  \n\nThey gave me something to ease the immediate pain, and insisted I visit my primary care physician the next morning. We ran labs for three days and found that all my levels were off. I could barely walk, barely eat. I was coming off a season of constant adrenaline, and when the pace finally slowed, my body followed suit. I learned the hard way that forty years old is not equal to twenty. My top priority would become rest in order to give my body the healing it required.\n\nWhen I read the story of the paralytic in Mark, I’m struck by the desperation of his friends to see him healed. Perhaps he had suffered a lifetime of loss and missed opportunity. And since there was no taxi to be found at midnight, they simply needed to find a way to get him in front of the Great Physician.\n\nThere’s a crowd in the way? No matter. There’s a roof in the way? No matter. Nothing deterred them from getting the help they were seeking. Their faith in Jesus’ power to heal enabled them to break through any barrier—literally. \n\nTheir tenacity moved Jesus. Scripture says when He saw their persistent faith, He uttered, “Son, your sins are forgiven!” (Mark 2:5). Jesus started with the inner healing of the heart, but didn’t stop there. He then commanded the man to get up and walk so the resistant religious leaders could see He had the authority of God to not only heal bodies, but also to forgive sins. \n\nWe want the external; Jesus goes after the internal.\nWe want what is seen; Jesus goes after what is unseen.\n\nDid He want the man to walk? Absolutely. Did He go after the healing of his heart? Fundamentally. \n\nThe nature of Jesus never changes. He always heals, always redeems, always restores. Our role is to come. When we reach our moment of desperate brokenness, no longer denying our sickness of heart and mind, we will do whatever it takes to get well. There we will behold His face, hear His voice, and receive His healing touch. \n\nThat’s the gospel, simple and plain. Jesus said, “Those who are well don’t need a doctor, but the sick do need one. I didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners” (Mark 2:17). \n\nI want to be among the ones who know they are sinners—broken, weary, in desperate need of a Savior. I want to experience a break-through-the-rooftop kind of healing. I pray the Holy Spirit will convict me, moment by moment, again and again. His conviction is a grace, a kindness, and a revelation that all is not well. But the healing we need is found in the forgiveness of our Savior, Jesus.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Mark 4:1-41, Amos 4:13\n\nMy childhood house is on the market. (It still feels weird to say it.) On my favorite mountain, yes. On the street lined with elm trees, certainly. On school bus 24’s route, always. But on the market—for sale, like a cup of lemonade from the neighbor’s kid? No, thank you. \n\nThis is probably why homeowners aren’t invited to the Open House. It would just be too hard to let go. Still, I can’t help but want to give prospective buyers some helpful hints as to how to live in the house. Perhaps, I’d offer them a sticky note tour.\n\nWelcome to our—er, potentially your—new home! I’d write. Don’t worry about taking off your shoes; the puppy’s ruined the carpet already anyway. \n\nHere’s where we keep the plates. Silverware can be found in the drawer on the left, and the trash can’s under the sink. \n\nMy dad stoned in that fireplace the summer before I started high school, and my mom made the quilt draped over the couch the summer I graduated college.\n\nMake sure you leave this door open for the cat, and help yourself to snacks. (I hide the chocolate in the top right cabinet.) Keep the front door closed so you don’t let the raccoons in! (I’m serious.) \n\nIt’s then that I realize what I’ve tried so hard to forget: the house they’ll be moving into won’t have snacks or cats or hand-me-down china or my mother’s quilts. They won’t be joining my family in the house. After we move out, the sticky notes won’t make any sense. \n\nInitially, some of Jesus’ parables don’t make much sense either. As He talks about sowing and mustard seeds, I imagine the onlookers wondering how in the world any of it applied to faith. So, why did Jesus tell parables? Was He making His lessons easier to comprehend? Was He avoiding complicated theology? No, Jesus was actually choosing to not let them understand.\n\n“To those outside, everything comes in parables so that they may look and look, yet not perceive; they may listen and listen, yet not understand; otherwise, they might turn back—and be forgiven.” —Mark 4:11-12\n\nJesus’ instructions were meant for those living in His house—His Father’s house, the Kingdom of God. The secret of the Kingdom God isn’t a story or an equation, but a person. And a story without Him, the main character, isn’t a story, but a parable. \n\nWhen listeners don’t see Jesus as the entrance to the Kingdom, or are out to manipulate His words, He creates a fence around His house by telling a parable. Jesus proves that you don’t arrive at the Truth by becoming smarter, wealthier, or more important; you find Truth by following Him to His house! \n\nAs for His disciples, Christ never leaves them hanging. He’s always willing to explain the parables when asked and reassure them with Truth. Privately, He would explain everything to them (Mark 4:10). The Harvest has come. It is Me. I am here. Do not fear. \n\nAs Christ’s followers, we get to live in that house with a protective fence and no need for sticky notes because we have His Word, filled with all we’ll ever need know. Thanks be to God! \n\n“He is here: the One who forms the mountains, creates the wind, and reveals His thoughts to man, the One who makes the dawn out of darkness and strides on the heights of the earth.\n\nYahweh, the God of Hosts, is His name.” -Amos 4:13\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nText: Mark 5:1-43, Acts 9:39-41\n\nThe sheer magnitude of Christ’s sovereignty is a general theme of Mark chapter five. He is a really big God! The “Giant Jesus” motif of Mark’s gospel account actually begins at the end of chapter four, where the Good Shepherd proves He’s large and in charge. In the middle of a storm, He stands up in a rocky boat on the Sea of Galilee to calm the seas with this concise command: Peace. Be Still. With those three little words He confirms His complete authority over the natural world. \n\nAt the beginning of chapter five, Jesus demonstrates His supremacy over the supernatural world (Mark 5:1-13), and then goes on to prove His Lordship over death (Mark 5:35-43). But in my opinion, the best part of this passage is a story-within-a-story, which illustrates not only the incomparable power of Jesus, but also the tenderness of our big God (Mark 5:21-34).\n\nThe woman isn’t named, but she is framed by the symptom of her malady—blood—which was a gross violation of Jewish propriety (Leviticus 15:19-33). If you had an open wound or obvious hemorrhage, you were barred from communal activity, including worship. Much like a leper, this bleeding woman was considered ceremonially ”unclean.” She certainly wasn’t supposed to be in a public setting potentially contaminating her “clean” neighbors. \n\nBut she was so desperate for relief from her suffering that she chose to risk weaving her way through the crowd in hopes of touching the edge, or even just the tassels, of Jesus’ robe (Matthew 9 depicts this same story with that particular detail). \n\nHer trembling alone might have alerted Jesus to her presence (Mark 5:33). I imagine her there, breathing fast and hiding behind her veil, scared someone in the crowd would expose her for trampling on Torah rules, inciting a stern rebuke from the local priest, if not a stoning by the whole community.\n\nYet our compassionate Redeemer doesn’t reprimand her for breaking the law. Instead He leans in and listens to her whole story. Can you imagine how long it took her to explain the 12-year saga of losing her health, wealth, relationships, and reputation? \n\nAnd don’t forget the context here: Jesus is on His way to the home of a prominent local leader to attend to his dying daughter—a medical emergency, presumably one with priority. Besides, this woman’s already been healed physically. She’s had her turn, so to speak. It would’ve been completely understandable if Jesus had just kept on walking toward the gated community where Jairus lived. But He didn’t; instead, He stopped and gave His complete attention to a seemingly insignificant fringe-grabber.  \n\nOne of my favorite living authors is a lovely, humble pastor named Max Lucado. I’ve had the joy of getting to spend a little time with Max and his family over the past fifteen years, but prior to the privilege of meeting them personally, a friend shared a heart-warming observation she made while at a large gathering in their home. \n\nOne of the Lucado girls, who was six or seven at the time, idled over to the piano to play a simple tune she’d recently learned. When Max heard the first note, he politely excused himself from a serious conversation with several important publishing executives. Then he walked over, leaned against the wall next to the piano, and watched her play with obvious affection. He made his little girl feel like the most important person in the room that night. And she was—to her daddy, anyway.\n\nMark chapter five reminds us that while Jesus is the King of all kings, He’s also a perfectly personal Savior who delights in listening to His kids play Chopsticks. The beyond-colossal Ruler of the universe bends down to prove He’s absolutely crazy about you and me. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Mark 6:1-56, 2 Kings 2:11\n\nWhen Jesus invited His disciples to steal away, sit, and stop for a while, you can imagine how readily they took Him up on the offer. In a world where a young girl can ask for the head of a prophet on a platter, and see the king swiftly grant her wish for fear of looking like a fool (Matthew 6:24-26), Jesus’ followers must have wondered what they’d gotten themselves into. But they’d seen the Son of God in all His glory, healing and saving and bringing dead people back to life. They’d witnessed with their own eyes that He was who the prophet said He was. They believed! Most of the time.\n\nLife as one of the Twelve was certainly eventful. Some passages in Mark’s Gospel make it sound nothing short of chaotic. “Many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat,” Mark writes (v. 30). Sound familiar? The chaos swirls and the demands of the day rise like waves, ready to wipe out all our best intentions. But Jesus says, Come away. Find the quiet. Rest a while.\n\nThe disciples tried, but chaos followed. Jesus and the Twelve got into boats and sailed off “to a remote place” (v. 32). But someone caught sight of them and word spread, and there was a crowd waiting for them when they reached the shore.\n\nJesus, being the compassionate Son of God, got out of the boat and taught the people, right there at the edge of the shore, and kept teaching well into the night (v. 34). The disciples, naturally, got antsy. Send them away, they said. They must be hungry for dinner, they said. \n\nYou’re right, He said, You feed them. And when the disciples looked at Him like He was crazy, He gently nudged them forward to faith. He nudged them to believe.\n\nFeed them what? they asked. After all, He’d told them to bring nothing with them (v. 8). All they had was a few loaves and fishes… and Him.\n\nIt’s Me, you guys. Believe.\n\nAfter that miraculous feast, Jesus sent the disciples ahead again by boat, but chaos still followed—this time in the form of wind and waves. Jesus walked to them, holy feet on top of the water, and they cried out in fear at the sight. “Have courage!” He said. “Don’t be afraid” (v. 50).\n\nIt’s Me, you guys. Believe.\n\nAnd this would be the pattern. Where Jesus and the disciples went, a bluster of activity followed. People rushed through the streets to find Him, carrying the sick and ailing around on mats, hoping just to brush against the robe of the One who could heal. “And everyone who touched it was made well” (v. 56).\n\nThe Twelve saw it all; they were standing right there. Still, they struggled to believe. Still, Jesus had to constantly remind them that He was who He said He was.\n\nIt’s Me, you guys. Believe.\n\nWe’ve seen it, too, you know. Many of us have seen Jesus up close, in our lives and in His Word. We’ve seen Him change hearts and heal sickness and bring hope to the dark. And still, here in the chaos, we struggle to believe. \n\nBut the Son of God stands and calls to us, just as He called to the Twelve. He calls us to come away and rest for awhile, to remember He is who He says He is. Yes, we are weak and weary, but we are invited to stay near the very Son of God. We can rest in the knowledge that He still has the power to feed and calm and heal.\n\nIt really is Him, friends. We can believe. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Mark 7:1-37, Jeremiah 17:9-10, Hebrews 8:6-7,10\n\nThe heart is glorified in our culture. We sing songs about it. We talk about following it, as if it were a wise guide. We paint it onto greeting cards in February—beautiful, pink, and symmetrical. Can you imagine what a greeting card heart would look like if it were painted after the heart we read about in Mark 7? \n\nMaybe one side of it would be pretty and pink, but the other side? Scraggly, grey, ugly. A lopsided, scary-looking heart wouldn’t help greeting card sales, I know, but it would better match the heart Jesus talks about in this passage. He says that from our hearts come “evil thoughts, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders, adulteries, greed, evil actions, deceit, promiscuity, stinginess, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness” (Mark 7:21-22).\n\nThese evils are not caused by some outside force. They originate from within us (Mark 7:23). Nothing like being told your heart is the root of greed and evil actions to get your day going, right? But if we can sit with this truth for a little while, something very beautiful is revealed.\n\nI remember hearing my mom compliment her friend one time on how nice she looked. Her hair was fixed. She had on a new sweater. Her make-up was perfection. She looked lovely. \n\n“Thanks,” the friend said. “My mom always taught me that if you’re having a bad day, you can at least put on a cute outfit.”\n\nIsn’t this our natural response? To pull ourselves together from the outside in? We scrub our exterior as much as we can, hoping to fix what’s dirty and broken on the inside. This might look like a new outfit, or volunteering at church, or making sure you’re seen with the right crowd. None of those things are inherently wrong or bad, but when we do them in an attempt to heal something that feels broken, or to earn the approval of our Father, they begin to reflect what the Pharisees were doing: fixating on the law and rituals.\n\nJesus had something to say about these attempts of ours: “These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. They worship Me in vain” (Mark 7:6-7). Our rituals and outward behavior will not bring us into true communion with Christ because those things are not His primary concern. He is concerned with our hearts. He sees straight through the exterior into the real—into the dark, the grey, and the ugly.\n\nAnd here’s the beautiful part: Jesus chose to live right there, in our hearts, and to write the law under this new covenant. “I will put My laws into their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be My people” (Hebrews 8:10). \n\nThis is what makes the whole gospel thing such a life-changer. We don’t have to scrub ourselves clean. The blood of Christ has already done that.  \n\nIt’s all too easy for me to slide back into Pharisee mode, to put on a cute outfit and hope for the best. But Pharisee mode prevents true communion with Christ. Let’s not offer Him our perfectly-symmetrical-greeting-card hearts today. Let’s offer Him our real hearts and, in return, experience real worship.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText:  Mark 8:1-38, Mark 9:1, 2 Samuel 7:14-16, Daniel 7:13-14\n\nI love reading the book of Mark because he makes no apologies for Jesus’ seemingly oddball behavior. To bystanders, His acts might’ve seemed whacky or even alien—like He’s not from this world. You can see this so clearly in Mark chapter 8. \n\nAfter Jesus miraculously fed 4,000 people in the middle of nowhere and with next to nothing (Mark 8:17), He and His disciples boarded a boat. That’s where the disciples quickly realized they’d forgotten something essential: food. Somebody forgot the food!\n\nWhat follows might be one of the saddest statements recorded in the gospels. “Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: ‘Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?’” (Mark 8:17).\n\nHis statement was filled with great sorrow, not because the disciples were thick-headed, but because they were so deeply entrenched in the ways of this world that they still couldn’t trust the promises of heaven. Jesus wanted them to see that He is not bound by the limitations of the physical world, so neither were they. \n\nThe Son of God did not follow the rules of the world. Unconcerned about fame, He told those He’d healed to not to say a word (Mark 8:25). When His disciples professed their belief that He is the Messiah, Jesus told them to keep it under wraps (Mark 4:10-12). Jesus did the opposite of what someone trying to gather a following would do, because His fame was not bound to this earth.\n\nBut Peter desperately wanted Jesus to stay here on this earth. They were healing people, feeding people, changing lives! So when Jesus began to explain that He was preparing to die, it was no surprise that Peter told Him to stop talking such nonsense. After all, Jesus was only in His thirties. Death was a long way off. Wasn’t it?\n\nJesus’ words were a loving warning: “You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns” (Mark 8:33).\n\nWhat are your concerns today? Are you hungry? Are you deeply desiring a change in your life? Are you desperate for peace? Are you confused about which job to take, what city to move to, or how to discipline that child who just seems to laugh at you when you put her in time out? These are valid concerns. They are real. But they are temporary. \n\nLosing our life—picking up our cross to follow Him—doesn’t necessarily mean suffering death by political execution. As Christians, everyday life is our cross. We are called to live with God’s concerns at the forefront of our minds, even as the world is screaming its empty promises at us. \n\nJesus is calling us to believe that He is fighting for us while we are silent, while we are still (Exodus 14:14). He is inviting us to be whacky like Him—to be of another world altogether. Like our Messiah, we can hold loosely to this temporary life because we know there is another, more brilliant Kingdom that is our home. \n\nHis dominion is an everlasting dominion\nthat will not pass away,\nand His kingdom is one\nthat will not be destroyed. \n—Daniel 7:14\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Mark 9:2-50, Philippians 1:15-18\n\nI love to get down to business. If we are in a swimming pool, I can’t handle any of that standing and splashing around nonsense. I’d rather accomplish something and swim. If I have something important to tell you, I’ll rush it every time, forgetting to shoot the breeze first. I just love to keep things moving along and attend to the business at hand.\n\nWhen Peter suddenly finds himself face to face with Jesus, Moses, and Elijah transfigured, he immediately switches on his “Let’s do something!” response. Just look at his reaction. He doesn’t know what to do or say, so he scrambles and offers to build a tabernacle. Never mind that he doesn’t have tools or supplies. He sees God incarnate and his natural response is,  “Let’s build a place to honor—and maybe hide—some of this awful glory.”\n\nJust like Peter, when I think of how to interact with the glory of God, I want to rush to fix things, to hurry and set up the proper structure for Him. I’m inclined to scramble when faced with His glory, because I’m usually only focused on my own role instead of His.\n\nWhen Jesus appears transfigured with Moses and Elijah, one of the many things He’s proving is that He is His Father’s Man. He stands illuminated with Moses, a symbol of the Law, and Elijah, a symbol of the prophets, and shows us that He is the literal embodiment of both. But Jesus is not just some symbolic fulfillment; His actual person fulfills the words of the prophets and the strictures of the Law (Matthew 5:17). He is doing His Father’s will, and it is blindingly glorious.\n\nIn the face of this shining glory we find Peter. He was chosen by Christ to be the rock of the church (Matthew 16:18)—he’s a big deal among the disciples. But Peter was still trying to figure out what it really meant for Jesus to be who He is. I imagine it’s hard to see all the might and power of the universe sitting on the shoulders of a teacher and friend. On the Mount of Transfiguration, Peter is trying his best to work it all out. But his best is still human understanding, and when it comes to the infinite, there’s a point where we just have to acknowledge our limitations.\n\nWhen we glimpse the glory of God, we’re often like Peter: ready to go build tabernacles (or whatever seems right for the moment) and get started right away. But God speaks and gently redirects us, saying, “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!” (Mark 9:7). \n\nLater, when Jesus heals the sick child, the response of the boy’s father is beautiful, yet simple: I do believe, but help me to understand (Mark 9:24, my paraphrase). Peter’s response could have been the same as that grieving father’s: Jesus! I believe. Help me to understand!\n\nIt’s not about me. It’s not about my belief or my ability to solve problems quickly. It’s about Christ revealed. God’s own glory is the centerpiece, not any human notion. \n\nFather, give us eyes to see as You see.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Mark 10:1-52, Isaiah 51:17, 1 Peter 4:13\n\nI’ll never forget the day Larry broke his neck. Wedged between cardboard boxes and covered in bubble wrap, my beloved rocking horse sat in the corner of a moving truck that would take him to my family’s new house, states away. \n\nMy dad dreamed up Larry shortly after I was born. He carefully calculated each detail, making sure it was short enough for my little-girl stature, wide enough to fill the empty corner of my bedroom, and colorful enough to make me cheer with delight. His creation was the perfect combination of mint green, pastel yellow, flowered harness, rope hair, and toddler joy. \n\nBut one sharp turn and a loud “crack!” later, Larry toppled into the truck’s side, breaking in two. I can only imagine the nightmares the poor truck driver probably still has after coming between a little girl and her rocking horse. \n\nAs I’ve become more aware of brokenness, I’ve realized it doesn’t always make a loud “crack!” As people fractured since the Fall, do we even notice the cracks? It’s easier to classify some things as broken: adultery, sickness, murder. But I’m slow to remember their opposites—marriage, wellness, friendship—are cracked too. Even our best is broken. \n\nC.S. Lewis reminds us that even our joy is broken:\n\n“We are half-hearted creatures, fooling around with drink\nand sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us,\nlike an ignorant child who wants to go on making\nmud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what\nis meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are\nfar too easily pleased.”\n\nFar too easily pleased. Friends, this doesn’t mean we’re low-maintenance children of God. Rather, we are refusing to believe God is the supreme good. \n\nIn Mark 10, the crowds are asking Jesus questions about the Kingdom of God, each one revealing their half-heartedness; they want His approval on matters of divorce, salvation, and money. God never approves brokenness, but He does send someone to heal it. How easily we forget this truth. Even our memories are cracked!\n\nWe are adulterers; He remains committed to us.\nWe want possessions; He calls us His.\nWe are broken; He is whole.\n\nThe crowd asks pointed questions as they pick up the earthly, broken pieces to see where they belong in the big puzzle of the Kingdom of God. In each of His responses, we see Jesus point to God’s divine creation (v. 6), joining together (v. 9), covenant promise (v. 39), and sacred union (v. 39). Jesus mends even the brokenness we cannot see. \n\nAlthough Larry’s neck is now held together by Super Glue®, I love him the same way I did right after the final coat of paint was finished and I could behold my dad’s complete and perfect work.\n\nDespite our false notions and obvious cracks, Jesus looks at us the same way, remembering His Father’s creation and perfect union. “Come, follow me,” He says (v. 21). Like the healed blind man who can now see, may we follow Him on the road to His Kingdom. Amen. \n\nWake yourself, wake yourself up!\nStand up, Jerusalem,\nyou who have drunk the cup of His fury\nfrom the hand of the Lord;\nyou who have drunk the goblet to the dregs—\nthe cup that causes people to stagger.\n—Isaiah 51:17\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Mark 11:1-33, Zechariah 9:9, Psalm 118:25-26\n\nThe day our son was born, I was astonished.\n\nThe mere reality of birth was a surprise. One minute, there were four people in the room, and the next minute, there were five. The baby who was theoretically growing in my belly for nine months was an actual human being—he was here! He looked nothing like I’d expected, and his birth didn’t go anything like I’d planned, but he was here. I was shocked by how immediately I felt like a mother; the pride and protective instincts I felt for my child caught me off guard. The whole experience can only be described as astonishing. Unexpected, yet wonderful.\n\nFast forward six years. My baby boy was a kindergarten rock star, but one man hundreds of miles away made me feel fear like I’d never known. I was at the grocery store not far from my son’s school when I heard the news that Sandy Hook Elementary had been attacked by a gunman. Boys and girls my own child’s age were terrorized, injured, even killed.\n\nI’ll never forget counting the minutes until my little boy’s eyes met mine as he pounced, carefree, off his yellow school bus. He was fine, but I was not. I was not astonished that day; I was afraid. I wept into the night, praying for protection for my own son, and comfort for the mothers and fathers and children in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, whose lives would never be the same. \n\nAstonished and afraid. There’s a big difference, isn’t there? When I read Mark 11, I notice both of these reactions to Jesus upon His arrival in Jerusalem. Some were astonished and others were afraid.\n\nIn verse 18, just after Jesus overturned the tables and chairs in the temple, Scripture says the chief priests began “looking for a way to destroy Him. For they were afraid of Him.” But the crowd? In that very same moment, they were “astonished by His teaching.”\n\nLater, in verses 30-32, the chief priests weren’t able to give an answer to Jesus’ question about John’s baptism. Why? Because “they were afraid of the crowd.”\n\nThis dichotomy appears often in Jesus’ ministry—the crowds are astonished and the religious leaders are almost always afraid. In Mark 1:11, when Jesus cleansed a man of an unclean spirit, Scripture says the crowd was “astonished at His teaching because, unlike the scribes, He was teaching them as one having authority.”  \n\nThis dichotomy of astonishment and fear appears in our lives, too. We’re astonished at the skill of Olympic athletes, and we are afraid of heights. We are astonished by double rainbows, and we are afraid of loud thunderstorms. As we read the reactions of those who received Jesus’ authority and those who hoped to explain it away, I wonder, How do I react when I encounter Jesus’ authority in my own life? \n\nDoes it make me afraid? Does it compel me to hold tight to the things I love, lest He shake up my plans?  \n\nOr do I feel astonished at His power, the same way I was astonished at the wonder of meeting my baby boy? Am I surprised and delighted by the way Jesus works in ways I do not expect?\n\nAs we read the book of Mark today, let’s notice the authority with which Jesus rides into Jerusalem like the King that He is, how He surveyed the temple quietly in verse 11, then commanded the fig tree to wither in verse 14. Let’s watch the “unexpected, yet wonderful” way Jesus cleanses His Father’s house and answers the chief priests as they attempt to usurp Him. \n\nBecause Jesus is our King, and He is God’s Son, His authority doesn’t have to make us afraid. We can simply watch, astonished by the King of Kings, who has all authority in heaven and on earth!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nText: Mark 12:1-44, Isaiah 5:1-5, 1 Peter 2:4-8\n\nMany of us have heard the parable of the tenants found in Mark chapter 12. The owner of a vineyard leases it to careless tenants who eventually kill his son in order to keep the spoils for themselves. It’s about God’s chosen people, the Israelites, the ones who thought the work of salvation would take gusto and bravado, laws and legalities. \n\nBut they forgot who owned the vineyard, the grapes, and the wine, and that He’d only allotted it all to them for a time. Then one day He took it back and gave it to the entire world: to the Gentiles, Samaritans, Romans—the ends of the earth—and now to you and me. \n\nSometimes I find myself still tending to the vineyards and missing out on the feast He’s preparing (Isaiah 25:6). I swat at the people He sends my way, kill the inklings of hope in His name, and fight off those coming my way only to serve. \n\nI try to sacrifice Christ again and again with my sore attempts at gaining my own righteousness. I try to produce prize fruit on the merit of my own labors. Because when I laid my crowns at the feet of Jesus, I certainly expected to pick them back up somewhere along the way.\n\nPaul warns Christians that, to be in relationship with Jesus, we’d actually have to fellowship in His sufferings, becoming like Him in His death (Philippians 3:10). I must not have understood this because I most definitely did not expect to be so trampled down (Isaiah 5:1-5).\n\nI am the irresponsible tenant and the wild, overgrown grapes. I have mistreated my Father’s things and I have grown wild in going my own way. I have turned away from His feast, certain I can prepare and keep a better one. I have not submitted to His pruning, certain I can handle the shears on my own. But the ruined vineyard and the irresponsible tenants are no match for the Vinedresser.  \n\nHe clears the field again, gathers those stones again, and sets in its corner a Stone greater than all the other stones (Mark 12:10). He resurrects it again—stone by stone by living stone—building it all together into a temple for the Holy Spirit, leveling it on the ground of His Son, solid and firm (1 Peter 2:4-8). And the vineyards within bear fruit in abundance—the work of the Holy Spirit, the Vinedresser, and the Son in unison with one another. \n\nThis is the work of fruitful farming in the field of faith: to know He will send friend after friend to help guide us back to the right path. He will trample to death that which doesn’t bear fruit and He will even prune what’s good to make it healthier—and sometimes we won’t know the difference. This is the work of faith, to believe and to tend, to submit and to bear fruit. But it’s all done under the watchful, caring eye of the Vinedresser, within the safe haven of the living stones, and on the bedrock of the Cornerstone, Christ alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Annie Downs\n\nText: Mark 13:1-37, Jeremiah 31:35-37, Isaiah 51:6\n\nThere is one app I use constantly when I’m driving. And no, it’s not iMessage. (NO TEXTING AND DRIVING!) It’s a map app that updates in real time when there are accidents or other hazards on the road. It even updates for speed traps. \n\nA few months ago, as I was driving back home to Nashville, the app sounded its alert. There had been a major accident forty or so miles ahead, meaning my trip would be extended by thirty minutes.\n\nI appreciated the alert, but didn’t love the news. \n\nWithin a few miles, the app beeped at me again with a new route. I was supposed to get off the interstate at the next exit and weave through backwoods Tennessee for thirty miles. I’d never been that way before, and I had no idea where I was going; but the app did, and that was enough for me. \n\nAfter doing the bob and weave down two-lane country roads, I began to run parallel to the interstate and could see it backed up for miles and miles. Cars were stopped dead in their lanes, and drivers were out walking among them as the highway was now completely shut down. Now traveling in a steady stream of moving cars tracing the back roads, I wondered if they all had the same app and directions as me. Soon our caravan of strangers got back on the interstate right past the overturned tractor trailer, giving us a clear path back to Nashville.\n\nI felt sorry for the people stuck in the traffic. They had no idea what was coming when they were casually driving up I-24. And while it wouldn’t have changed the situation (that poor, unfortunate tractor trailer strewn across four lanes of traffic), it sure would have changed their response to it!\n\nThat traffic app is kind, in a weird way. It sees what I can’t see, warns me of things I want to avoid. It makes me feel safer to have the information.\n\nMaybe that’s what Jesus was doing on the hilltop overlooking Jerusalem. He chose to protect and care for the disciples—and us—through very hard times, by warning us that they were on the way (Mark 13:5-8). \n\nEvery building will fall apart?\nWars and rumors of wars?\nKingdom against kingdom?\n\nIt sounds scary and dangerous and altogether bad. This could not have been the disciples’ favorite conversation they’d ever had with Jesus. But what might sound harsh and frightening is really an act of Jesus’ love and protection. \n\nDo these warnings ever terrify me? WELL, SURE. But they are not meant to bring fear or worry. They are Jesus’ kindness to us. He sees what we cannot see, and sprinkles in a new set of directions throughout the text. “Be on your guard,” He tells us. “I have told you everything ahead of time” (Mark 13:23). And for that, we should be so grateful. \n\nWe can trust Jesus, no matter what is coming around the bend. We may not avoid pain and suffering along the way, but He promises we will see Him in the midst of it—because He’s already there.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Mark 14:1-72, Isaiah 53:2-3\n\nWaste not, want not. Right?\n\nWhen the woman at Bethany cracked the expensive jar of oil and poured it over Jesus’ head, her relatives flared their nostrils and demanded, “Why has this fragrant oil been wasted?” It seemed like a good question because the jug of oil was worth 300 denarii (Mark 14:4-5). Considering a day’s wages in Palestine at that time was one denarius (Matthew 20:2), this woman poured out a year’s wages on Jesus’ head, and all she had to show for it was oily hands.\n\nBut Jesus wiped His eyes and celebrated her gift, announcing that she had anointed His body in advance for burial. Indeed, in this chapter, the longest in the Gospel of Mark, we see Jesus in the center of several kinds of preparation as He walked through the days that led Him inexorably to the cross. \n\nThe preparations began with a plot to kill Jesus (v. 1), followed by the parenthetical anointing to prepare His body (v. 8). This led to the disciples’ preparation for Passover (v. 12) and concluded with Jesus’ prediction of betrayal (v. 18). And in the middle of all this preparation and betrayal, Jesus stopped and instituted the Lord’s Supper. He was preparing them for life without Him. \n\nIt makes sense that this indelible sacrament—one of His dearest gifts to us—was given as He was surrounded by betrayal on one side and suffering on the other. But the gospel is only realized in suffering. In fact, there is no gospel apart from Christ’s suffering. \n\nAs He broke the bread and offered up His body, Jesus was really giving us His whole “person” (Aramaic), His entire “being” (Greek). He then took the cup and said to them, “This is My blood that establishes the covenant; it is shed for many” (vv. 22-24). The Last Supper is the truest representation of our fellowship with Christ, and in this meal we see that His gift to us was complete.\n\nThe guests at Jesus’ final table would go on to betray Him—and not just Judas. In the end, they all deserted Him (v. 50). But even the most evil plots of men are within the scope of God’s providence. Isaiah prophesied that Jesus would be “despised and rejected by men” (Isaiah 53:3), and so it is fitting that the Lord’s Last Supper was attended by traitors. \n\nThe Lord’s Supper is not a table of virtue; it is a table of grace. Even on our best days we cannot earn His gift. He invites us to partake just as He invited the disciples—in spite of our betrayals and scheming against Him. Apart from Christ’s suffering, there simply is no gospel. \n\nNone of these preparations or promises made sense until He went to the cross. The great mystery of the gospel is revealed in Jesus’ death. \n\nThe jar that was broken to anoint Jesus was a complete gift. No one could pick up the shards and piece the pottery back together for another use later; the jar was smashed and irrevocably given (Mark 14:3). Christ was crushed for us, and His sacrifice is also freely, entirely, and totally given. We remember this every time we partake of the Lord’s Supper (Isaiah 53:5). His extravagant gift to us was not wasted and has changed the world forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Mark 15:1-47, Psalm 38:20-22, Hebrews 5:7-10\n\nHere we are at Mark 15—the crucifixion of our Savior. Would you enter into this text with me?\n\nAt the start of this chapter, we find Jesus standing before a crowd of chief priests, elders, and scribes. These men, along with Pilate, do not believe Jesus is the Son of God, and they accuse Him of many things.  \n\nFrom there, Jesus is taken in front of an even greater crowd, a “multitude.” They, too, refuse to believe He is the Son of God, and demand for Him to die a criminal’s death.\n\nThen, the soldiers take Him away and clothe Him in a robe and a crown of thorns. “Hail, King of the Jews!” they yell (Mark 15:18). But they don’t actually believe Jesus is the Son of God, and so they mock Him, beat Him, and then lead Him away. \n\nNow, as Jesus hangs on the cross, the bystanders and passersby do not believe He is the Son of God. They blaspheme Him and taunt Him. \n\nIt seems everyone—Pilate, the chief priests, the multitude, the soldiers—has denied who Christ is. Nobody believes. All are blind and darkness consumes them, both literally and metaphorically. \n\nThis is our Good Friday sermon, and we know it well. We know we have to wait until Sunday, resurrection day, before we can talk about hope and life. But if we look closely at this chapter, we see a glimmer of hope begin to slide its way in, right here, in the ninth hour as the darkness lifts and Jesus cries out His final words: “‘Eloi, Eloi, lemá sabachtháni?’ which is translated, ‘My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?’” (Mark 15:34).\n\nUntil this moment, all we have seen and heard is denial, skepticism, and accusation toward Christ. Now, in the midst of all these voices, rises one who believes: “When the centurion, who was standing opposite Him, saw the way He breathed His last, he said, ‘This man really was God’s Son!’” (Mark 15:39).\n\nFinally, the truth is spoken about who Jesus really is.\n\nAfter the centurion, Mark mentions the other believers who were present, like Mary Magdalene, “many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem,” and Joseph of Arimathea (v. 40-41). The story is still dark, Sunday is not yet here, but as these people are highlighted amongst the unbelievers, we begin to feel all is not lost.\n\nWhen I read the centurion’s words, I am reminded that our disbelief can never be so strong that it will change the truth about who Christ is. In our darkest moments, when everyone around us—in our country, school, workplace, or home—seems to deny Him, Jesus will always be the Son of God. Nothing we say or do, no amount of denial, can change that. What God ordained from the beginning of time cannot be thwarted by a mob. That was true in Mark 15, and it’s true today. \n\nI am really anxious for us to get to the next part of the story, the beautiful resurrection and the hopeful ascension. But as believers, we know there is hope smack dab in the middle of the darkness. All we have to do is look up at the cross and declare what that centurion did so many years ago. Only this time, let’s use present tense: This man really is God’s Son!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Mark 16:1-20, Acts 1:6-11, Isaiah 53:4-6\n\nWe’ve called Mark “the Gospel of Jesus on His feet,” and now we’ve seen it to be true.\n\nThrough fifteen chapters, we have watched as Jesus went about Galilee preaching the good news and healing the sick, feeding the hungry and teaching His disciples what it means to believe. We saw Him stand on His feet before the chief priests and their accusations, with only silence and truth as His defense. We saw Him climb a mountain and walk on water.\n\nBut then, the Gospel of Jesus on His feet came to an abrupt halt. The Messiah was led to a cross and crucified. One day. Two days. Three days in the ground, and then He was up again. The stone was rolled away, and a man shimmering in white stood to greet the women in the tomb. There was no body for them to anoint; He was gone. Jesus had been raised from the dead.\n\nAnd that’s how the Gospel of Jesus on His feet resumes, right here in Mark 16. Only now, everything has changed.\n\nHere, at the very end of Mark’s Gospel, there is a crucial shift: Jesus had completed the work He came to earth to do. He had healed and taught and traveled and forgiven and died and risen. And then, He commissioned.\n\nJesus implored and empowered His disciples to continue the ministry He began—the same disciples who, even upon hearing eyewitness testimony of Jesus’ resurrection, still didn’t believe until they saw Him for themselves. He called them to preach the gospel. Now, you go, He said to them. You heal. You teach. You spread the message of the forgiveness of sins. Get on your feet and go.  \n\nJesus called His disciples to stand up and step out, and then He did something stunning: He sat down.\n\n“Then after speaking to them, the Lord Jesus was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.” -Mark 16:19\n\nStill today, Jesus sits at the right hand of His Father. He sits because the saving work He came to do here on earth has been done. He declared as much from the cross when He cried out, “It is finished” (John 19:30). The act of salvation is sealed and cannot be undone. Now, with the assurance that our Lord lives and reigns, we get to respond to His call: Get on your feet, and go.\n\nThe disciples were not alone as they went. Jesus had promised to go with them (John 14:26), and He did.\n\n“And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them…”\n-Mark 16:20\n\nFriends, the Gospel of Mark is not just the “Pedestrian Gospel” because of the action of the fast-paced narrative. The Gospel of Mark is the Pedestrian Gospel because it is the plainly presented message of the gospel of Jesus Christ—the forgiveness of sins accomplished in full by His life, death, and resurrection. It is the Gospel for all of us. For her and him, for you and me.  \n\nWe’ve not just heard about Him. We’ve seen Him. By His power and grace, let’s get up and carry His good news to the world. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nThe older I get, the more wary I am of getting my hopes up. I’d hoped to get the lead in the school play, but I got a secondary role instead. I’d hoped to get into a master’s program, but I didn’t. I’d hoped that relationship would work out, but it ended. Because of this, I have become very good at what I call “hope management.” I never let my hopes get too high. In doing so, when my hopes fall, the landing is softer.\n\nThis is why I can’t blame Zechariah for questioning the angel Gabriel when he tells him, “Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will name him John” (Luke 1:13). Zechariah protests. He was an “old man” and his wife, Elizabeth, “was well along in years.” Although Zechariah was clearly in the midst of a heavenly encounter, his question has undertones of disbelief: “How can I know this?” (v.18).\n\nThis tells me that Zechariah and Elizabeth had gotten their hopes up about a child before, and Zechariah can’t face the disappointment again. He can’t name another unborn child in expectation, only to have those expectations dashed. But as a result of Zechariah’s unbelief, he is unable to speak until the day his son is born and he sees God’s promise fulfilled.\n\nMary’s response to Gabriel is different. She is told something equally unbelievable––that she, a virgin, will conceive a child. Gabriel instructs, “You will name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end” (vv.31–33).\n\nBut Mary’s question is more logistical than it is incredulous: “How can this be?” (v.34). As the CSB Study Bible says, “The difference between Mary’s response… and Zechariah’s is that Mary asked her question not from unbelief but from puzzlement.”\n\nThe nation of Israel had high hopes for a Savior for generations. I would not blame Mary for containing her hope. But she does the opposite. While Zechariah’s mouth was closed, Mary’s opens in praise: “My soul praises the greatness of the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior” (vv.46–47).\n\nThese words reflect the type of unmanaged, unharnessed hope I want to have in response to the promises of God. Instead of reserving my hope, smothering it, not letting it get too high, I want to hold hope with open hands, believing the Lord will do what He says, that He will make good on His promise to save.\n\nWhat I have that Mary didn’t at this point in her life is the end of the story. I know God made good on His promise to save. When that is where my hope lies, I cannot be not disappointed, and instead, I can declare:\n\n“The Mighty One has done great things for me, and His name is holy.\nHis mercy is from generation to generation” (vv.49–50).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nWhat is a book you’ve read again and again? Or perhaps a movie you’ve seen more times than you can count? Or a song you’ve had on repeat for years? Though I’ve read the words of my favorite book or watched the same scene of my favorite movie a dozen times, I often react to it differently depending on the day I’ve had or the season of life I’m in. I may feel a lot of emotion, or I may feel inspired. Other times, I may simply want to listen, watch, and savor the story. Let the words and notes sink in.\n\nSomething I love about Luke’s narrative of Christ’s birth is the array of responses from those who witnessed the Messiah, either at His birth or soon after. From awe to silence to praising God, I think we can learn as much about the significance of the incarnation from these responses as we can from the details of the birth itself.\n\nMary’s response to her son’s birth is quiet and contemplative. While the shepherds, after meeting Jesus, ran off and told everyone about what they had seen, Scripture says, “Mary was treasuring up all the things in her heart and meditating on them” (Luke 2:19). She savored the moment, holding it near to her, letting it sink into her heart and mind.\n\nSimeon, the righteous servant of the Lord, responded to meeting the Messiah by praising God and declaring the mighty works Jesus would do. As he tells Mary, “Indeed, this child is destined to cause the fall and rise of many in Israel” (v.34).\n\nThen there is Anna, the prophetess. Her response to the Messiah’s arrival was gratitude and, like the shepherds’, to spread the good news: “At that very moment, she came up and began to thank God and to speak about Him to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem” (v.38).\n\nJesus’s birth evoked silent awe, praise, gratitude, and the need to tell everyone about it.\n\nMost likely, the story of Jesus’s birth is not new for you. You’ve probably read it or heard it told again and again. But I wonder, what is it evoking in you today? Awe, joy, gratitude, praise? Do you want to shout about it from the rooftops like Anna, or do you want to be still and treasure it in your heart, as Mary did? Though our responses will vary, we are united by the reason behind the coming of the Messiah. \n\n“God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons” (Galatians 4:4–5). \n\nWe are redeemed. We are adopted. We are a part of God’s family. No matter what kind of day you are having or what sort of season you are in—quiet and contemplative or loud and joyful—let the story of Christ’s birth remind you of these truths today.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nFrom what I can tell, John the Baptist was a man to be respected. He spoke with authority. Others came to him to be baptized. They asked him for advice. They called him teacher. Many of them even wondered if he was the Messiah.\n\nJohn could have told the crowd anything by the Jordan River that day, and the people probably would have followed him, but John used his God-given authority to point them to Christ: \n\n“I baptize you with water, but one who is more powerful than I am is coming.\nI am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals.\nHe will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire” (Luke 3:16).\n\nSeveral years ago, I took a trip to Italy with some friends. We visited the Vatican in hopes of seeing the renowned Sistine Chapel, where Michelangelo painted the ceiling. Tourist-friendly signs dotted the Vatican campus with the words “Sistine Chapel” and an arrow pointing in its direction. Or so we thought. Many of the signs simply pointed us to the next sign that said “Sistine Chapel.” We followed sign after sign until we almost gave up.\n\n“The Sistine Chapel isn’t here!” we declared dramatically. “These signs are lying to us.”\n\nWe did eventually wind our way to the chapel and see what we had come to see, but only after several detours that took us by other Vatican sites and gift shops.\n\nAs Christ-followers, we have been given a similar charge as John the Baptist—to be signs pointing toward the coming Christ. And yet, how often do I squander this opportunity? How often do I use my voice to point first to myself, rather than Christ? Speaking with authority, I take friends and loved ones on a detour of my own gospel. I give them all of my advice and all of my opinions when really what they need first is the comfort of Christ, the love of the Savior. \n\nAt the same time, I have often been a sucker for the signs, looking to others’ authority before Christ’s,  settling for my favorite pastor’s, author’s, or podcaster’s words, rather than allowing Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection to have the final word. \n\nAs we see in the response to John the Baptist, we are a people quick to worship humans and look for guidance from earthly sources. Many people claim to have authority. Dozens of signs promise to get you where you want to go, but there is only one Christ, only one Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world—and that is not John the Baptist, but the One to whom he was pointing. \n\nMay we look to Christ alone as our authority, and may we point others to Him as well, always quick to say, “one who is more powerful than I am is coming.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nTo begin His public ministry, Jesus returns to His hometown of Nazareth and preaches in the synagogue. His homecoming message is so controversial, the townspeople—the people He had known since He was a child—“drove him out of town, and brought him to the edge of the hill… intending to hurl him over the cliff” (Luke 4:29).\n\nThe crowd is with Him for the first part of His message, when He quotes the prophet Isaiah, saying He had come to preach the good news and to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor (vv.18–19). But when He mentions the widow in Sidon whom the prophet Elijah helped, and Naaman, the Syrian whom Elisha healed, the crowd gets upset. These are stories of Gentiles who were shown favor above Israelites.\n\nThe crowd would have been familiar with these stories, and they would have known their meaning. This good news Jesus was preaching was for everyone, not just the Israelites but the Gentiles also—not a popular opinion among God’s chosen people, as we can see from their response.\n\nNow, I’ve had some difficult homecomings. I’ve had disagreements with friends and family from time to time, but none of them has ever been so displeased with me that they attempted to hurl me off a cliff.\n\nIn this passage and elsewhere in Scripture, we see a common response to Jesus: People wanted His miracles, but not His message.\n\nThe crowd is amazed when He casts out a demon in Capernaum. They bring their sick to Him to be healed. They follow Him around, hoping to see Him perform other miracles. But when Jesus preaches the truth in the synagogue? They want to kill Him.\n\nJesus’s miracles were amazing, yes, but His message was convicting. People like to be amazed. They don’t like to feel convicted.\n\nI know, in my own privilege, I often prefer the turns-water-into-wine Jesus over the seeks-justice-for-all Jesus. If Jesus is just a miracle worker, I can sit back and enjoy the show. But if Jesus is first and foremost a justice-seeker, I have to get in the ring and be about His work.\n\nJesus’s message in the synagogue proves His priority was not to amaze us with His power, but to redeem us—Jews and Gentiles alike—with His blood.\n\nI can see myself in the Galilean crowd that tried to keep Jesus from leaving so they could witness more healings. I need the reminder Jesus turned and gave them: “It is necessary for me to proclaim the good news about the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because I was sent for this purpose” (v.43).\n\nThis is our purpose too. May we seek after Christ because we want to do as He did, not watch from the stands. May we remember that Jesus is our Redeemer, not a performer. And while we can stand in awe of His power to heal and cast out demons, may we be most amazed by His power to save.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nIntellect and logic would have told Jesus’s first disciples not to follow Him. They hardly knew the guy. They had stable jobs as fishermen and tax collectors. By the world’s logic, they shouldn’t have left steady paychecks to follow a practical stranger! But Jesus told Peter, James, and John, “Don’t be afraid; from now on you will fish for people” (Luke 5:10 NIV). No questions asked. No curiosity expressed at the utter strangeness of this statement. What do you mean, “fish for people”?  The men simply “left everything, and followed him” (v.11).\n\nIt was the same with Matthew. Jesus hadn’t yet shaken Matthew’s hand before He was inviting the man along, saying, “Follow me!” Matthew’s response? Leaving everything behind, “he got up and began to follow him” (vv.27–28).\n\nAs a result of the disciples’ responses, they ended up on the adventure of a lifetime. Full of pain and heartache, yes, but oh, how it was worth it.\n\nWhile reading today’s passage, I found myself feeling jealous of the disciples’ seemingly easy faith—and resonating with the Pharisees’ suspicious and questioning attitude. In some seasons, faith is easy. My heart believes. I see God at work and can faithfully follow. These days, faith is not coming as easily. My head is loud: This isn’t practical! This isn’t logical! Make a better plan for yourself! My heart is afraid: What if this doesn’t work out? What if Jesus was wrong? What if this will all be for nothing? I am uncertain of taking the next step Christ is calling me to. I am wary of the unlit path before me, even with Christ beside me.\n\nBut what does Jesus say? Don’t be afraid. Follow me.\n\nPerhaps the disciples’ faith is not the point here, so much as Jesus’s belief in them. He had faith in Peter, James, John, and Matthew, didn’t He? He saw something in them they did not see in themselves, or else He wouldn’t have asked them to follow Him. Maybe when my faith feels weak, I do not need to muster more. Maybe it’s enough to remember I was called. Sometimes faith precedes the step. Sometimes it comes after.\n\nThe response to Jesus by these first disciples is immediate and whole-hearted. They leave everything behind. They follow Him—not because they are pious or perfect, but because Jesus is worth following. All they know at this point is they want to be near Him. So do I. Let’s surrender our hearts and our heads to Christ today. Let Him lead us on the unlit path. It may have pain and heartache, but oh, my friends, I think it will be worth it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nHave you ever missed the party while it was happening? Looking back, you realized, Oh man, that was it! The magic was happening right in front of me and I didn’t see it! I find myself in this situation again and again. Hiking on a mountain but missing the view on account of stinging flies. Or brushing off my children’s impromptu theatrical performances to keep to my own schedule. I even remember being so caught up in the minutiae of pins, flowers, and curling irons on my sister’s wedding day that I forgot to take in the simple beauty and goodness of my sister transformed into a bride until we found ourselves giggling in the bathroom at her reception.\n\nWe are all prone to miss the important things. In the moment, it can be tough to even know whether something is vital until it’s too late. The Pharisees are missing a tremendous moment that is right in front of them. Because Christ wasn’t what they expected, they turned off their sense of expectation. But that’s the thing: Christ does not appear as we want Him to. His law, His logic, His person, His actions, even His teaching, do not conform to man’s way of thinking or living. He comes as Lord of the Sabbath, and if we are caught up like the Pharisees in what we imagine that to be, we miss Him as He is.\n\nIndeed, He is Lord of a kingdom that cuts against the grain of every human inclination. When He calls the twelve, He doesn’t pick from among the great or accomplished. He chooses the lowly, the ordinary, even the despised. When He heals, He does not curry favor with the high and mighty, but heals foreigners and the weak. His Beatitudes and the woes that follow overturn every modern notion of morality, self-esteem, and success. His call not to judge, but to love even our enemies, runs counter to every inclination toward self-justification and vengeance.\n\nThere are only two foundations: the foundation of Christ or the foundation of man’s natural disposition, which crumbles and fails. Instead of depending on the foundations that we build ourselves, we can stand on the foundation of the Lord of the Sabbath and stand secure. If we’re expecting Christ to be our personal sentimental version of newborn baby Jesus, we are going to miss the majesty and truth of Him as Lord of All.\n\nHere is the good news: Though we are prone to hypocrisy, to blindness, to judgment and folly, Christ comes to us anyway; He comes, loving His enemies and doing good to those who despise Him. He makes us His, and we can take comfort in this promise: “Everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher” (Luke 6:40). Christ calls us away from ourselves to Himself, and in so doing, makes us like Himself. “We know that when he appears, we will be like him because we will see him as he is” (1 John 3:2).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThis year, as part of our celebratory Christmas decorations, we set up a fantastic black-and-cream toy train under the tree. Once a day, I would let the kids play with it for a few minutes. They would sit on their tiny knees, leaning forward and exclaiming while the train made its allotted brave journey around the tree several times. Then I’d remind them to turn it off and move on with their day.\n\nOne of my best friends laughed at me for this, saying, “You’re limiting their Christmas magic so you don’t have to spend money on replacement batteries?!” Yeah, I guess I do tend to be a little parsimonious when it comes to… well, everything. Some of us are miserly with our resources. Maybe you are a bit freer with your spending; we’re all different. But if I had an alabaster jar filled with perfume I would reluctantly parse it out over many years, and I’d be hard-pressed to slop it all out in one afternoon over a stranger.\n\nWhether you are free or tight with resources, it’s important to know when it’s time to set aside your personal inclinations. Otherwise, we are like the Pharisee who invited Jesus to his house but held back on the hospitality. If the Pharisee had realized Who was sitting at his table, and what debt of gratitude he owed Him, would he have been so close-fisted in his actions? And centuries later, knowing Jesus’s purpose and intent, would we have washed His feet and offered Him a kiss? Unless we are aware of our great debt of love, it’s hard to remember who we are and what we are called to do.\n\nWhen we realize how much we have received—how much we have been forgiven—then everything comes into perspective. We too often hold back pieces of our lives for ourselves, because we fail to see how greatly we have been forgiven. If we were to comprehend the full abundance of God’s forgiveness, how could we hold back anything from Him? In Him we have received all things, beyond what we could ask or imagine.\n\nLike the woman in Luke 7, we who have been forgiven much can appreciate the depth of Christ’s love. The more we see our need of Him, the more opportunity we have for gratefulness and love for His deep forgiveness. He doesn’t speak of the woman’s shame, only of her love.\n\nIn John’s vision of heaven, the twenty-four elders cast their crowns at the feet of Christ, crying out: “Our Lord and God, you are worthy to receive glory and honor and power!” (Revelation 4:11). Everything changes because of who Christ is. By His sacrifice, He has given us abundant forgiveness and overwhelming love. He calls us to live our lives in thankfulness—and when we remember who He is and what He has done, how can we keep from falling at His feet in grateful love?\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Parables and Miracles",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nJesus used parables to teach both the crowds and His disciples. Typically, He first spoke the parable in the hearing of all, and then in private explained it to His disciples. But even the disciples were curious about this, and so they asked Jesus, “Why are you speaking to them in parables?” (Matthew 13:10).\n\nIt’s a funny thought. Why would Jesus want to make things more complicated? Isn’t the kingdom of heaven a sufficiently difficult idea to grasp without riddles? And isn’t it hard enough to comprehend what it means that Jesus is the Messiah, even when explained in plain Aramaic?\n\nYes! And here’s Jesus’s fascinating response, “Because the secrets of the kingdom of heaven have been given for you to know, but it has not been given to them” (v.11). What?! The disciples got secrets that everyone else didn’t get? But wait, there’s more. Jesus continued, “For whoever has, more will be given to him, and he will have more than enough; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. That is why I speak to them in parables, because looking they do not see, and hearing they do not listen or understand” (vv.12–13).\n\nThey think they understand, but they don’t. Now when we read Jesus’s parable of the sower and see the Word fall on unfruitful ground, we can see what He’s talking about. Some hearts are hard, and some hearts are not ready.\n\nChrist’s Word was at the center of His ministry. His Word is valuable—His Word is life—and not everyone understood it. We stand at a wonderful time in history because now we, like His disciples, get to be taken aside to hear Him explain His own Word. The messianic mystery is made even more understandable for us than it was for the disciples because we have access to the entirety of Scripture.\n\nLike the disciples, we need Christ to interpret His Word. Without the illuminating work of the Holy Spirit, we are like those who have eyes yet see not, and have ears yet hear not. Apart from Christ, we are unfit soil and will bear no fruit.\n\nLike the disciples, we are to listen attentively and carefully, seeking to know more. We are not to clutter our hearts with the vain loves and cares of this world. “Therefore, take care how you listen” (Luke 8:18). The light of the world has come to reveal all things, and in His light, nothing remains hidden. So let us look to the Lord and ask Him to give us eyes to see, ears to hear, and hearts to believe (Acts 28:27).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nIn the quiet following the large-scale, miraculous feeding of the five thousand, Jesus asked His disciples, “Who do the crowds say that I am?… Who do you say that I am?” (Luke 9:20).\n\nEveryone had their own version of who Jesus was. Many, like Herod, were curious but perplexed. Others believed Him to be Elijah, a prophet of old, or a resurrected John the Baptist. And I can’t blame them, because even with all the prophecy and typology in the Old Testament, no one had ever seen the Messiah. Jesus as Messiah was a completely new kind of being.\n\nBut good old Peter jumps right in with the correct Sunday-school answer: “God’s Messiah.” Bam! Atta boy, Peter. But even Peter’s confession was revealed to him, not by flesh and blood, but by the heavenly Father (Matthew 16:17). Even Peter needed help sorting out the right answer.\n\nAnd who is God’s Messiah? What does this designation mean? The true Messiah would be the One who would suffer and die for the sins of God’s people, and after three days rise again, though not even Peter had understood that much. The Messiah was not merely one of the prophets, or Elijah, or John. He was the One for whom John prepared the way in the wilderness. We have the advantage of history on our side, knowing that Jesus did suffer, die, and rise again. And we can use that advantage to answer with Peter, “You are God’s Messiah.”\n\nWhat should we do with this information? Right away Jesus follows Peter’s confession with: “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me” (Luke 9:23). Since I don’t have a physical, wooden cross handy, I can’t help but wonder, What does it means to “take up your cross”? Jesus laid aside His glory to bear the cross to Calvary; this was His greatest act of self-denial and obedience to the Father. It is self-denial for the glory of God.\n\nIn the same way, He calls us to set aside our own wills and be fully devoted to the Father’s will. Here’s the sticking point: This is the hardest thing on earth to do. I love doing my own will. It’s my favorite thing. And Jesus specifies that taking up one’s cross is a daily action. With the apostle Paul, our response to the risen Messiah is to die to ourselves daily (1 Corinthians 15:31). So every day, we are called to do the absolute hardest thing in the world—die to ourselves and set aside what we want.\n\nWe’re all like Peter; we can blurt out Sunday-school answers, but the very next minute, we need someone to say to us: “Get behind me Satan!” (Matthew 16:23). We aren’t able to set aside our own will so easily. So how do we take up our cross? We simply take up Christ. We fall at the beautiful feet of the One who has brought us the good news of the gospel (Romans 10:15). We cling to Him, leaning on His perfect righteousness, day after day.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nHave you ever watched kids wait for the bus? Our kids wait at the end of a long driveway, and somehow that distance makes them think they are surely out of my eyeshot. They imagine themselves in a Lord of the Flies world, where no adult can see them, and a child would willingly bludgeon his brother for fruit snacks. They act like the bus stop is a land of limbo where perfect impunity reigns supreme. But our driveway is just not that long.\n\nDrinking my coffee, I watch from the window as my own children frantically blow through a punch list of morning offenses. They are in such a hurry to let it all hang out before they find themselves under the next authority: Miss Pitt, the bus driver. She will brook no nonsense in a moving vehicle. The world is a sinful place, though, and Miss Pitt isn’t always looking in her giant rearview mirror, telling them to sit back down.\n\nMy kids aren’t outliers. We all enjoy the luxury of being out from under authority, to cut loose and do what’s right in our own eyes. And we are the people the Christ came to save. Those of us who are giving noogies, slapping faces, and stealing cookies at the bus stop—those of us who are hiding our shame, returning to our sins, and feeling beaten down by what we’ve done. We are the people Christ came to save. We’re all in the same boat. We’re just better at hiding our misdeeds than children are.\n\nThe day after Jesus’s transfiguration, He came down from the mountain, into the adorable, unwashed fray of regular humans, and He immediately encountered our brokenness. “You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long will I be with you and put up with you?” (Luke 9:41). He knows that we are trying to hide from authority, but this is exactly why He came. He came down from glory to heal a broken world.\n\nEven in the midst of His longing for our redemption, Jesus was about the business of healing, saying to the man in the crowd, “Bring your son here” (v.41). While the crowd and the disciples worried about who was supposed to be able to cast out demons, Christ had fixed His eyes upon the redemption of all things. He knew about the glory of God and was not confused by squirrely, bus-stop shenanigans. He knows that we are broken and full of terrible nonsense, but Jesus understands who He is, who His Father is, and who we are. He is not surprised that we are getting it wrong; that’s literally why He came.\n\nJesus came to save the lost and the broken. He shows forth the glory and greatness of God. Be astonished today, not at the misdeeds of man—that’s not surprising at all—but at the greatness of God’s love and grace for us. His name is great, and He is greatly to be praised (v.43).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI was born in the 1980s—before digital cameras, before text messages or Instagram or any other instantaneous method of sharing photos of newborns existed. My dad used to take pictures of me and physically mail them to his parents. According to family legend, when my grandmother opened the envelope, she would call my dad and ask, “Why did you mail me a baby picture of you?”\n\nMy grandmother kept pictures of her family everywhere, on almost every available square inch of her walls and tables. It was one of my favorite things about her house. Every time we’d visit, we’d look at the baby picture of me next to the baby picture of my dad and marvel at the similarity; I looked exactly like my dad as a baby.\n\nScripture tells us Jesus is the exact expression of God’s nature (Hebrews 1:5). He “is the image of the invisible God,” and all of God’s fullness—all of it!—dwells in Jesus (Colossians 1:15,19). Jesus reveals this to His disciples in Luke 10, giving them a glimpse into His divinity. Jesus was God in the flesh, walking around on earth—fully man, fully God. The invisible God (John 1:18) became visible, flesh and bone, to dwell with His people.\n\nThe technical term for Jesus’s humanity and divinity is the “hypostatic union,” the mystery of His perfect union of God and man. We don’t know how that union works; we only know that it does. Jesus also tells us why the Father it is a mystery: because the Father intended it to be (Luke 10:21).\n\nThe Word became flesh and dwelt among us… we have all received grace upon grace from his fullness… No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and at his father’s side—he has revealed him (John 1:14–18).\n\nJesus came because it was the Father’s good pleasure for the Son to dwell here, to live a fully human life, to stand in our place, and to take the punishment for our sin. Jesus came to reveal the Father’s lavish love and the riches of His grace. This Jesus, who loved sinners and outcasts, who died for His people to satisfy justice and turned over temple tables in perfect, righteous anger, who wept at the death of His friend and washed His disciples’ feet—this is our God incarnate, the full and perfect expression of who our God is. All glory and honor forever be to Him!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI was home alone one evening when someone started knocking at my door. We have a rather unwelcoming “No Solicitation” sign posted on our door, and it was past the time for a postal delivery. And yet, the knocking persisted. Generally, I don’t answer the door when I’m home alone, but I peeked around the corner and saw that it was our friendly neighbor, looking exceptionally apologetic.\n\n“Do you have a corkscrew we could borrow?”\n\nWe did, and I gave it to him, and sincerely told him to knock anytime.\n\nThe parable Jesus tells in today’s reading is about a persistent neighbor, only this one is knocking and knocking and knocking at midnight, after the whole house had already gone to bed. Some commentaries call this parable humorous, a quality we don’t always assign to Jesus’s words, but in this case, the story plays out a bit like a sitcom.\n\nA man and his family are asleep in bed, when a neighbor starts knocking. Eventually, the man gets up, begrudgingly, not out of the kindness in his heart, but because of his friend’s “shameless boldness” (Luke 11:8).\n\nThe point Jesus is making is not that we should be hospitable at all costs, even dragging ourselves out of a warm bed in the middle of the night to give our neighbor some bread. He’s telling us we should approach God with the same shameless boldness of the knocking neighbor in the parable. Some translations call it the neighbor’s “impudence,” or “shameless audacity.” These are not words I typically think of when I pray.\n\nI am learning, however, to be persistent in prayer, praying the same things over and over again—not out of disbelief, but out of belief and faith. Every night, I pray the same words over my daughters: “Please show them how much You love them. Give them hearts that love You, eyes that see You, ears that hear You.” It’s not laziness, but persistence. Over and over, I ask, seek, and knock at God’s door in prayer.\n\nJesus’s illustration of persistent prayer follows the Lord’s Prayer, a tangible example of how we should pray every day. His answer to the disciples’ request, “Teach us to pray,” is two-fold. First, pray for things like these. Second, pray persistently.\n\nYesterday, in Luke 10, we read about how Jesus came to reveal the Father. Today, He shows us how we can speak to the Father. Jesus invites us to know Him. And through Him, we’re invited to know the Father, too, to pray to Him without ceasing.\n\nMay we ask, seek, and knock with persistence and faith, knowing that God will always answer for the good of all those who love Him, and to make known the riches of His glory (Romans 8:28; 9:23).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nMore often than not, there are times when anxiety feels like my closest friend. It greets me in the morning, my heart rate rising with the sun. It follows me to the mirror, to the breakfast table, to the car, to work. It is the shadow I can’t get rid of, an endless churning of guilt and shame and fear in my heart and mind. It’s a disease, a chemical imbalance, a generational struggle.\n\nThis particular passage in Luke features a lot of anxiety, from the revelation that nothing hidden won’t eventually be known, to the fear of death, to the “unforgivable sin,” to Jesus’s famous command not to worry because we are worth more than the wildflowers and the sparrows.\n\nI tend to read Luke 12 as if it’s all about me: what I worry about, what I value, what I should or shouldn’t do. Don’t be like the Pharisees; fear God. Don’t be afraid; acknowledge Jesus as the Christ and don’t deny Him. Don’t blaspheme the Spirit (which is considered the “unforgivable sin,” the denial of Jesus’s work to the point that one considers it to be demonic). Don’t store up treasure for myself. Don’t worry about clothes or food—and on and on.\n\nWhile I do think Jesus is teaching us a lot about ourselves, our worldly impulses, and the things we worry about, He is also revealing much about God, His character, and His work. There are three specific truths I want to rest in today: first, the sovereignty and care of the Father; second, the advocacy of the Son; and finally, the provision of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe Father: In Luke 12:6–7, we see a clear picture of the limitless power and the all-surpassing knowledge that God possesses. Everything hidden will be revealed. This would be terrifying if it weren’t for the next part. Even though everything awful we’ve ever done will made public, our belief in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus makes us clean before God.\n\nThe Son: In verse 8, Jesus tells us that if we acknowledge Him, He will acknowledge us in the presence of God the Father (“before the angels of God” is a reference to God’s presence). He is our advocate in prayer before God, but He is also our advocate for salvation before God, the righteous Judge.\n\nThe Holy Spirit: Verse 12 teaches that the Holy Spirit is our provider, who will give us the words we need to acknowledge Christ when we are persecuted. Jesus promises His followers that the Spirit will give them what they need to continue in faith.\n\nIn a passage known for its treatment of anxiety, Luke assures us that God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit are working together in perfect unity, to care for us in perfect knowledge, perfect advocacy, and perfect provision.\n\nI may battle my anxiety until the day I walk into glory, but the death of my anxiety is assured because of the life of Jesus. The more the book of Luke reveals to me about the beauty of the Son, the closer I feel to the heart of the Father.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nIn Andrew Peterson’s beloved Christmas album Behold the Lamb of God, he sings the song, “Deliver Us,” based on Jesus’s lament for Jerusalem in Luke chapter 13. He sings, hauntingly:\n\nJerusalem, Jerusalem\nHow often I have longed\nTo gather you beneath my gentle wings.\n\nEven typing these words brings tears to my eyes. Peterson captures, in a way that only master songwriters can, the ache of the ages. The song ends with those lines, an answer to the previous verses that are sung from the perspective of God’s wandering people:\n\nOur sins they are more numerous than all the lambs we slay\nOur shackles they were made with our own hands\n\nJesus’s lament summarizes the history of God’s stiff-necked people. Jerusalem—used here both literally, in reference to the city, and also as a metaphor for God’s people throughout time—had a history of turning away from God and abandoning the prophets, judges, and even the Messiah God had sent to them. Even earlier in this chapter, we see a specific example of the Pharisees questioning Jesus’s miracles. The crowds believed, but the leaders rejected Him.\n\nDespite the innumerable sins of His people and their continuing self-imprisonment due to their own choices, Jesus weeps over the city and the people He came to save (Luke 19:41). God longs to gather His children, to protect them, to gather them under His wings (Psalm 91:4). Jerusalem is His greatest joy (Psalm 137:6), the people He will go to the greatest lengths to save. It is the promise of the whole of Scripture.\n\nJesus stands outside of the city where He will die, and His lament is not for His death. His lament is for the people He longs to save. He has just finished warning them, telling them that by not believing Him they will not join Him in the kingdom of God. But His lament shows us that He does not make these proclamations about the narrow way out of anger, but out of grief.\n\n“How often I wanted to gather your children together…\nbut you were not willing!” (v.34).\n\nEven in His lament over the past and current rejection of His people, Jesus knew He would be rejected yet again in Jerusalem. But the steadfast, faithful, persistent love of the Father through the ages, embodied in the person of Christ, never fails. Love would carry Jesus all the way to the cross, into the dark tomb, and ultimately, into the glorious resurrection—where He invites us to join Him, forever.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Teachings on Humility",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nI am uncomfortable writing about pride and humility, precisely because I have too much of one and not nearly enough of the other. I dare say I’m not alone, either. I did a little bit of cultural research when I started writing this, because I wanted to see how other people talk about humility.\n\nFirst, I found a series of business articles in prominent journals about how humility is the secret to good leadership—including an article literally titled, “17 Reasons Humility Will Help You Get Ahead.” Later, I found an article about the power dynamics of choosing your seat in a business meeting, and research about the psychology behind your choice.\n\nWhat Jesus says in Luke 14:7–14 is exactly the opposite: “But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place” (v.10). When He tells this parable, Jesus isn’t teaching a large crowd. He is eating a Sabbath meal in the house of Pharisees, the group that would be largely responsible for later placing Him on trial.\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus confronts the Pharisees three times. First, He heals a man on the Sabbath, an issue over which the Pharisees had previously confronted Him. Second, having observed the Pharisees carefully choosing their seats at the Sabbath meal, He tells a parable about being humble and always choosing the worst seat. Third, He tells another parable about a wedding feast where none of the invited guests come, so the host extends the invitation to the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.\n\nThroughout Luke, we see Jesus inaugurating the kingdom of God and proclaiming its values. He challenges the Pharisees, and He challenges our hearts. The parables He tells are for His immediate audience, but they are also for us, showing us the way life should work in His kingdom. And in the kingdom of God, humility isn’t a tactic to get ahead. It’s not a carefully-calculated decision about where to sit in a meeting, or at a party.\n\nIn his book, The Freedom of Self-Forgetfulness, Tim Keller writes:\n\nGospel-humility is not needing to think about myself. Not needing to connect things with myself. It is an end to thoughts such as, ‘I’m in this room with these people, does that make me look good? Do I want to be here?’ True gospel-humility means I stop connecting every experience, every conversation, with myself. In fact, I stop thinking about myself. The freedom of self-forgetfulness. The blessed rest that only self-forgetfulness brings.\n\nI’ll pray through those words today, asking for self-forgetfulness and gospel-humility, asking for the Spirit to convict me when I put people and things before Jesus, and praying, inspired by the words of Paul in Romans, “Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud; instead, associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own estimation” (v.16).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Lost and Found",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nIf you’re fortunate, it’s been long enough since you’ve experienced being lost, that you’ve forgotten the sheer terror of it. Dig into your memories and find yourself there again, tucked into a clothing rack at a department store, searching for signs of your mama, or wandering through an unfamiliar city without your GPS, and allow yourself to feel it anew. The sweaty palms, the dry mouth, the disorientation that comes from not knowing which direction to go, the desperation to find yourself safely tucked back into the arms of the familiar.\n\nWe can’t fault the Pharisees and scribes, not really. They saw Jesus breaking bread with the “lost,” and they forgot, bless them, how remarkable it is to be found. “And the Pharisees and scribes were complaining, ‘This man welcomes sinners and eats with them’” (Luke 15:2). And so Jesus lays out a series of lessons.\n\nHe starts with sheep, a relatively disposable commodity. As a sheep farmer myself, I can say with certainty that the flock matters, as do the individual hooves and horns that make it up, but a lost sheep or two is relatively minor. That is, unless you’re the Good Shepherd… or that one sheep who’s wandered off.\n\nAs the religious leaders listened to Jesus, perhaps they counted themselves among the ninety-nine, safe in the pen of rules and right thinking. And yet, whether in the pen or gone astray, the Good Shepherd deeply loves His sheep, all of them. Pay attention to the numbers in this first scene. The ratio of lost to found is one to ninety-nine, but Jesus is about to raise the stakes.\n\nConsider a woman with ten silver coins. One slips through her fingers. It’s lost but not forgotten. She searches earnestly until the coin is in her hands. In Jesus’s second story, the ratio of lost to found is one to nine. Perhaps the Pharisees were still stifling a yawn at this point. Who cares about a single straggling sheep or even a single roll-away coin? When it comes to livestock and treasure, value is all relative.\n\nBut what about a son? Would we disregard a lost son carelessly? A loving parent would exhaust every resource to bring their lost boy home. The ratio here is intimate. One boy at home and one gone astray, one obedient and one in rebellion. Each time the Lord teaches the principle, the margins narrow. Heaven can never become so full of the saved that the Lord will cease to care about the lost.\n\nThose who bear His image are not cattle to Him. He doesn’t think of us like pennies, barely worth being picked up off the sidewalk. We are His beloved children, the apple of His eye (Psalm 17:8). At the cross, He proved He would pay any ransom for us, even if we were the only one lost in the darkness of sin. What the Pharisees didn’t see was that Jesus wasn’t just eating a meal with the lost. He was searching for lost sheep, seeking missing treasure, and running to meet His beloved sons and daughters.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nWe tend to pluck out Christ’s teachings and deliver them as neat and tidy Sunday school lessons. Every word is true and useful (Proverbs 30:5; 2 Timothy 3:16), and yet, when we place ourselves in the sandals of the original hearers and listen as they would have listened, we discover a depth we might otherwise miss.\n\nLet’s use Luke 16 as our case study for this principle. Luke 15 sets the scene. A crowd of tax collectors and sinners had gathered around Jesus, annoyed that “this man receives sinners and eats with them” (v.2). The nerve! Jesus addressed their unrighteous indignation with a string of vivid lessons. If we were watching this text unfold as a theatre performance, our program might read something like this:\n\nScene 1: A sheep, a coin, and a son—three stories about the lost.\nThe curtains would then fall and rise again to…\nScene 2: A swindler, a beggar, and a rich man—two stories about true riches.\n\nChrist’s words, “One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much” (Luke 16:10, ESV), are scribbled into the bottom of my laundry baskets as a reminder that if Jesus can’t trust me to do laundry well and with joy, He surely can’t trust me with something more significant. Laundry aside, this is the point Jesus makes in the parable of the dishonest manager. Though at first glance it might seem Jesus holds up the manager’s swindling as model behavior, it’s not the dishonesty Jesus wants us to emulate; it’s that he views money as a means to an end. So should followers of Jesus; the accumulation of wealth should never be our goal, but if we can use earthly wealth for eternal good, we will prove ourselves faithful. “So if you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will trust you with what is genuine?” (v.11, CSB).\n\nFast forward a few verses. Jesus is still responding to the hard-hearted Pharisees (vv.14–15) when He tells the tale of a rich man and a beggar named Lazarus. Lazarus dies and is in glory; the rich man dies and is in torment. After the rich man pleads for Lazarus to go to his relatives and call them to repent, the lesson ends with these words: “If they don’t hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead” (v.31). God’s Word has been beating the same drum since the beginning: wealth might make things easier in this life, but it’s not what matters for the next. End scene.\n\nJesus was talking to people who valued wealth and saw it as a sign of God’s favor, but He reminds them that the kingdom doesn’t have quite the same economy. The faith of a child—not money or possessions—is all that’s needed. Money is alluring, but it is a master who ultimately disappoints. God looks at our hearts, not our bank account statements. “And he told them, ‘You are the ones who justify yourselves in the sight of others, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly admired by people is revolting in God’s sight’” (v.15).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nI’ve sung the hymn “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing” nearly every night for the past decade. It’s the lullaby I sing over my children as I put them to sleep. I’ve spent thousands of hours rocking a swaddled cherub in my arms and softly singing these words:\n\nCome, Thou Fount of every blessing\nTune my heart to sing Thy grace\nStreams of mercy, never ceasing\nCall for songs of loudest praise\n\nI mean it. Deep down in my gut, I swear I do. And yet, in the light of day, when life is hard, my heart doesn’t turn toward praise quite so easily. The Lord described us perfectly when He said, “They always go astray in their heart; they have not known my ways” (Hebrews 3:10). There’s no sense in trying to sugarcoat it.\n\nThe prophet Isaiah declared, “We all went astray like sheep; we all have turned to our own way” (Isaiah 53:6). It’s why Robert Robinson, writer of the hymn I mentioned above, included these words, “Prone to wander, Lord I feel it. Prone to leave the God I love…” And why I sing them to my babes, knowing they inherited their wandering hearts from me. I’m so prone to wander toward fear, doubt, and worry, instead of trusting that God will come through. If the measure of my blessings hinged on the amount of my faith, I’d have to go without.\n\nFaith is the only gift we have to offer the Lord. It’s what the Samaritan leper brought Jesus in Luke 17, and it was enough. “And he told him, ‘Get up and go on your way. Your faith has saved you’” (v.19). But unlike faith, the grace of God isn’t measured in mustard seeds. The “streams of mercy” we sing about are more like a tidal wave, capable of washing away our sin and guilt (Zechariah 13:1), even when our faith is frail.\n\nPerhaps the reason I’m so comforted by the words of Come Thou Fount, is because of a story I once heard about its songwriter. As it goes, one day Robinson was riding in a stagecoach when a lady asked him his thoughts on the hymn she’d been humming. Robinson reportedly replied, “Madam, I am the poor unhappy man who wrote that hymn many years ago, and I would give a thousand worlds, if I had them, to enjoy the feelings I had then.”\n\nI’m so grateful for and encouraged by the disciples’ request of Jesus, found in Luke chapter 17. They asked, “Increase our faith!” (v.5). Their words remind me of the tender prayer of a father desperate to see Jesus heal his boy found in Mark 9:24, “I do believe; help my unbelief!”\n\nProne to wander. Lord, I feel it. And yet, we serve a God who is relentless in pursuit of us (Luke 15:4). Whether you have faith the size of a mountain or a speck today, you can wrap yourself up tightly and rest in this:\n\nJesus sought me when a stranger\nWandering from the fold of God\nHe, to rescue me from danger\nInterposed His precious blood\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nIn my high school youth group, we used to play a game I loved. The game was Bigger or Better, and the object was simple: keep trading up for the biggest or best prize. To start, we were divided into teams and each team was given a single paper clip. We were then unleashed on a neighborhood with a simple assignment: “Come back with something bigger and better than this.” We’d go house to house, making trades. At first, we’d trade in the paperclip for something smallish, like a cup or dish. We’d trade that in for something bigger… say, a basketball or framed piece of art. And on and on we’d go, until we were called back together to display our spoils.\n\nTrading up is always a thrill. This is the message the rich ruler seemed to miss during his encounter with Jesus. He had his eyes on the prize of eternal life, but he misunderstood the path to getting there. Though he recognized Jesus as a “good teacher,” he missed God’s heart. This ruler was a good child who turned into a good man, and he wanted assurance that he was good enough.\n\nJesus rattled off a few of the ten commandments: “Do not commit adultery; do not murder; do not steal; do not bear false witness; honor your father and mother” (Luke 18:20). To which the man had the audacity to respond, “I have kept all these from my youth” (v.21). But even if this man had been perfectly obedient with these commandments, keeping the letter of the law is not the same as following the heart of the God behind that law.\n\nJesus offered him a trade up.\n\nInstead of keeping all the rules, the man could sell all his belongings. You see, Jesus knew that despite his outward obedience, the rich young ruler was missing out. His money was in the way. Rather than asking the man to make a tremendous sacrifice—another religious task—Jesus was really offering the man his freedom. But it does not always appear that way to those of us who hear such offers. No wonder the crowds declared, “Then who can be saved?” (v.26).\n\nJesus’s response: “What is impossible with man is possible with God” (v.27).\n\nGo on, bring to the Lord whatever you hope will save you. Bring your good works and best days. Bring your charity and church membership. Bring your idyllic childhood and productive adulthood. And trade them in. He may not ask you to sell everything and give the proceeds to the poor, but He will ask you to part with anything in your life that’s keeping you from knowing the love of God.\n\nAccept Christ’s invitation to lay down your goodness for something better. It’s a trade up.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Triumphal Entry",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nOne of the great riddles of being human is what to do with all the waiting.\n\nWe wait for the seasons to change.\nWe wait for our hurts to heal.\nWe wait for our children to grow up… then wait for them to return home.\n\nWe’re all waiting for something, and as my favorite rocker, the late Tom Petty, liked to remind us, “The waiting is the hardest part.”\n\nPay close attention to what’s happening in Luke 19, and you’ll see that while Christ’s followers were celebrating His triumphal entry into Jerusalem, they were waiting too. Verse 11 reveals, “As they were listening to this, he went on to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem, and they thought the kingdom of God was going to appear right away” (emphasis mine).\n\nThe crowds were following Jesus, expecting Him to bring an end to their waiting. They thought He would enter Jerusalem, exile the government that had been oppressing them, and establish the glorious kingdom He’d been telling them about. This is the moment, they must have thought, when all the waiting—for freedom, for peace, for victory—will surely pay off. \n\nBut Jesus wasn’t about to stage a coup. He was marching toward the cross. The crowd’s hopes and dreams for the establishment of Christ’s kingdom on earth would have to wait. (At least for the kingdom the way they had expected it).\n\nFast-forward to today. You’re still waiting too. So am I. We want to see God move in our lives. We want to watch Him come in power and abolish everything that causes us pain. Instead of wringing our hands and pacing the floor, what can we do while we wait?\n\n“The whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen” (v.37). Though at this point the crowds still assumed Jesus was going to lead a military victory, they were right to rejoice over what they had already seen in anticipation of what was still to come.\n\nThe greatest indicator of what Christ will do is what He has already done. In every season of waiting we can join with the “multitude” of saints in declaring the victories He’s already given. The disciples had no way of knowing they were watching a preview of a future celebration of Christ’s triumph, when He will one day return in glory:\n\n“Then I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse. Its rider is called Faithful and True, and he judges and makes war with justice… The armies that were in heaven followed him on white horses, wearing pure white linen… And he has a name written on his robe and on his thigh: King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Revelation 19:11,14,16).\n\nCelebrate every promise you’ve seen Him fulfill, every victory He’s ever secured, every blessing He’s every poured out. They are the down payment for the moment when all of our longings will be fulfilled. May we worship while we wait.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nPatrick and I sat in a tasting room with ten strangers, drinking wine from delicate glasses. Before us, an expanse of windows revealed a golden hillside. Our host raised a bottle of cabernet and smiled. As he poured the red wine, he told us about the vineyard’s renowned owner, John Shafer, a man who, in 1972 had left a successful banking career in Chicago to purchase farmland in California. A pioneer in American winemaking, John Shafer’s wines helped put Napa Valley on the map.\n\nEnraptured by the tale and tastes, I almost didn’t hear the door open behind me. Turning, I saw an elderly man walk in, using a cane. Wrinkled but smiling, he had blue eyes and a faint suggestion of hair on top of his head.\n\n“Well, here he is,” the tasting host said, standing quickly from the table. “This is John.”\n\nI could tell from the flabbergasted look on our host’s face, that this was no normal drop in. At ninety-two years old, the vineyard owner rarely made appearances. For decades, he’d put in the hard work of tending grapes. Now, he trusted his sons and staff to maintain his legacy. As I stared at John Shafer’s face, I felt like I was in the presence of royalty. In his presence, I cared a lot less about the wine and a lot more about the man who’d made it.\n\nThroughout Scripture, a “vineyard” is used as a metaphor for the nation of Israel. In Luke 20, the crowd listening to Jesus’s parable would have recognized that symbol. With this story, Jesus proclaimed that if the Israelites rejected Jesus, the promises and inheritance of God would go to new owners. In other words, God was about to offer His grace, kindness, and salvation to the Gentiles. The chief priests, scribes, and elders reacted quickly, shouting, “That must never happen!” (v.16).\n\nImagine if John Shafer had turned to me, and right there in front of his employee, said, “Claire, I’d like you to take over the day-to-day operations of this place.” Consider if he’d smiled, raised a hand, and pointed to the land outside those shining windows. “The whole thing is under your management.” Do you think his employee would have raised a toast? Not likely. Instead, they would have thought the owner had gone mad.\n\nFor millennia, Jews held claim to the exclusive privileges of being God’s people. They couldn’t believe those blessings could extend to anyone else. Jesus’s presence, His kindness to Samaritans and women and disabled people, His claims to be the Son of God—threatened everything the Pharisees held to be true. They were in the presence of the vineyard owner, and yet they refused to release their death grip on the grapes. They couldn’t see the person because their eyes couldn’t look past their own power.\n\nIf I felt awed by the presence of John Shafer in a tasting room, how much more should I be in awe of Jesus, who hands me the keys to His kingdom? It’s a kindness so kind, it might be seen as irresponsible. He has given us an inheritance that is “imperishable, undefiled, and unfading” (1 Peter 1:4). Some may reject Him, but to all who receive Him, Jesus gives the right to become children of God (John 1:12).\n\nHe steps forward, points to the vineyard, and says, “My beloved sister, enjoy.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nOne of the great perks of being a novelist is the research. Recently, for reasons that are not fully apparent to me, I’ve been devouring anything I can read about Italian orphanages during and after WWII. I’ve even connected with an eighty-year old Neapolitan man through Facebook. Through Google translate, he’s shared about his experience growing up under the care of a Christian family, the Santis, who ran the only Protestant orphanage in Southern Italy, a place called Casa Materna.\n\nThough Casa Materna is now closed, I immediately ordered every book on Amazon about the place. In reading about the Santi family during WWII, I was struck by one situation in particular. Under constant surveillance by Mussolini’s fascist spies, Papa Santi, the founder of Casa Materna, was arrested for his activities and his preaching. At the trial, the judge asked him what he preached every Sunday at the orphanage. In response, Papa Santi began reading directly from the New Testament! His unjust persecution turned into an opportunity for unparalleled witness.\n\nFrom my position of safety and wealth, WWII might seem like ancient history. But I am really just two generations removed from that reality—a reality that may have looked a lot like Jesus’s prediction of the end of the age.\n\nJesus doesn’t sugarcoat the truth for His disciples. He explains that the future is going to be full of war, famine, plagues, and natural disasters. He describes the destruction of the temple, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the persecution of believers. It is a picture of great chaos. And yet! In the midst of that chaos, His followers are to stand firm and lift their heads.\n\nMuch like Papa Santi in the midst of the chaos of WWII, Jesus’s followers are not to be distracted by the chaos of the kingdoms of the world, but to keep their eyes focused on the kingdom that is coming, one that cannot be shaken. Jesus is our only hope, our only comfort. Despite the chaos of the world, He will still come back. The Son of Man will not leave us as orphans. He will come with power and great glory. He is coming back to rescue us. It is a certainty. He promises, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away” (Luke 21:33).\n\nWe shouldn’t expect our future to look much different from what Papa Santi faced in his lifetime. But what Jesus told His disciples is still true for us. We do not need to prepare our defense against the world; we need only to draw close to the Defender.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nWhen I was a freshman in college, I grew in my faith like never before. I became captivated by the gospel, thirsty for truth, and passionate about Jesus. It was one of the sweetest and most vibrant chapters of my faith, but this explosive growth was accompanied by one negative consequence: self-righteousness.\n\nWith my newfound convictions, I felt strongly about the way things should be done, and the way things should not be done. When I went home on breaks, I lectured my parents about our home church and the things that needed to change. I pronounced harsh judgments on friends who were not following Jesus. I frowned disapprovingly when my boyfriend’s parents drank wine with their dinner. I was, in a word, insufferable.\n\nThankfully, my parents were patient and wise. They listened and gently challenged some of my thinking, but they also recognized I was young and in need of shepherding. In contrast with my demeanor, they showed grace.\n\nI will never forget that season of my life, when my love for Jesus resulted in some very un-Jesus-like behavior. I will forever be humbled by it, because it continues to remind me of the truth that human brokenness and sin runs deep, perverting even our noblest intentions.\n\nIn Luke 22, this aspect of sin is on full display. First we have the chief priests, who oversee Jesus’s arrest. In his commentary, The Gospel of Luke, New Testament scholar Joel B. Green explains that these religious leaders “believe themselves to be serving God, yet unwittingly serve a diabolical aim.” Then, we have a disciple who, in his desperation to defend his teacher, draws his sword and cuts off the ear of a chief priest’s servant. Swiftly and sharply, Jesus condemns this violence (v.51).\n\nWithin this scene we see two different types of people who are trying to honor God and doing just the opposite instead. How can we avoid doing the same?\n\nFirst, we must admit that we will inevitably do the same, because we are human. The same brokenness that runs through the high priests, and the same brokenness that runs through the disciple (Peter, according to the parallel account in John 18) also runs through us. We will get it wrong, and that is precisely why we need a Savior. Even our best efforts can become mangled by sin. That said, the Lord’s Table—which sits at the center of this chapter—is a compass of sorts.\n\n“And he took bread, gave thanks, broke it, gave it to them, and said,\n‘This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me’” (Luke 22:19).\n\nWhen Jesus instructs His disciples to remember, He is not only talking about His death. He is also talking about the example He set throughout His life. Jesus is the Savior who does not need weapons or worldly power to achieve His means. Jesus transformed the entire world by humbling Himself and laying Himself down—first in a manger, and then on a cross—and this is the standard to which we are held. This is how we preach Christ, without opposing Him in the process.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Death of Jesus",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nOn September 11, 1934, theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote the following words in a letter to a friend:\n\n“We must finally stop appealing to theology to justify our reserved silence about what the state is doing—for that is nothing but fear. ‘Open your mouth for the one who is voiceless’—for who in the church today still remembers that that is the least of the Bible’s demands in times such as these?”\n\nBonhoeffer penned this plea as the Nazi regime was gaining power, the death toll was growing, and many of his fellow Christians remained silent. He watched in horror as the German church failed to speak up and do what was right, choosing instead the false innocence of silence.\n\nEighty-five years later, it is easy to look back and judge. It’s easy to wonder how Christians in Germany failed so miserably. And yet, to do so is to deny one of the most common tactics of sin: shifting blame.\n\nBlame-shifting is a thread that runs throughout Jesus’s trial in Luke 23. Pilate knows Jesus is innocent, and he does not want to execute him, and so he hands Jesus off to Herod (v.7). Herod, in turn, sends Jesus back to Pilate (v.11). Pilate then appeals to Jesus’s accusers, suggesting that a lesser punishment would be appropriate (v.16–20). But the crowds are unsatisfied. They will settle for nothing less than the death penalty. For a third time, Pilate pleads with the crowd to be reasonable (v.22), but they will not be dissuaded. Finally, Pilate finally hands Jesus over to them.\n\nIt would have been easy for Pilate to blame the crowd for Jesus’s fate. After all, he spoke up—multiple times!—but they insisted. What more could he have done? It also would have been easy for Herod to blame Pilate. After all, he didn’t kill the man. He simply handed him over to someone else.\n\nThis is what sin does. It shifts blame while insisting on its own innocence: So long as I wasn’t the one nailing Jesus to the cross, or rounding up my Jewish neighbors, or leading the lynch mob—I am innocent.\n\nHowever, when we read the story of Pilate, we are reminded that God holds us to a far higher standard. The story of Pilate chastens us with the truth that a holiness built on omission, inaction, and looking the other way is no holiness at all.\n\nIn Stuart Townend’s famous hymn, “How Deep the Father’s Love for Us,” he describes the events of Luke 23 this way:\n\nBehold the man upon a cross,\nMy sin upon His shoulders;\nAshamed, I hear my mocking voice\nCall out among the scoffers.\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine mocking our beloved Jesus. It’s nearly impossible to envision a time when we might look into His heartbroken eyes and jeer, impossible to imagine that we might be included among those for whom He prayed, saying, “Father, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing” (v.34). But the tragic story of Pilate reminds us that sometimes the loudest act of abandonment is choosing to say nothing at all.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nThis year, my husband and I started a church, and in many ways it has been the most amazing adventure of our lives. We have seen signs and wonders, answers to prayer, supernatural provision, and the fruition of God-given vision. My husband and I have been awed and amazed, and truly, we will never be the same.\n\nAnd yet…\n\nAll along, during these months of amazement, I have noticed something funny in my soul. Call it an “inability to digest.” I have seen the miraculous with my own two eyes. I have experienced it, and I have lived it. And still, a part of me wonders, Really? Did that really happen? It’s as if my faith cannot catch up. No matter what God does, no matter how powerful and unforgettable, my brain struggles to wrap itself around the truth.\n\nThis is the dilemma of being a finite human being who worships an infinite God. As long as we live on this earth, we will struggle to grasp the ways of God. We observe this struggle in Luke 24. First, there are Jesus’s closest female companions, who have followed Him and supported Him all the way. By this point, they should have “gotten it,” yet when they see the empty tomb, they still have to be asked, “Why are you looking for the living among the dead?” (v.5). Then, in verses 36–37, when Jesus appears to the disciples, they assume they are seeing a ghost. Even after studying His hands and feet, they were still wrestling with disbelief (v.41).\n\nWhat this tells us is that faith is much harder than we often like to admit, and we see this theme woven throughout the Gospels. Over and over, Jesus’s followers fail to understand Him, and they struggle to believe. Whether it’s Jesus’s purpose, identity, or plan they’re misunderstanding at any given moment, they are consistently unable to keep up. Their faith never does keep pace with all that Jesus is doing.\n\nAnd I get it. This year, I have found myself in that place again and again, fumbling for a faith that matches the magnitude of all that God is doing around me. It’s humbling and convicting.\n\nThankfully, the good news of Jesus Christ does not rise and fall on the size of our faith. If that were the case, Jesus’s disciples would not have accomplished very much. Instead, the gospel of Jesus Christ rises and falls on the reality of His life, death, resurrection, none of which is strengthened or diminished by our ability to fully comprehend it.\n\nThis is the grace we have in Christ. Our faith will never match the size of His works. Our belief will never catch up to all that He is doing. But the story of Luke is the story of God using imperfect people with imperfect faith to accomplish Christ’s mission in the world. All that God requires is a willing heart—willing to try, and willing to fail—trusting Him to redeem the whole of it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: John 1:1-51, Genesis 1:1-5, Isaiah 55:10-11, Hebrews 1:1-4\n\nGathered around the living room, we remained seated as the doorbell continued to ring. We didn’t need another casserole or vase of sympathy flowers; we needed words. \n\nVoid of compassion, the blank document—an unforeseen obituary—stared back at us, wringing all adjectives of their meaning, one after another. Each suggested description seemed to shrink our beloved boy, the one who held the titles of both my best friend and my younger brother, into someone foreign and unrecognizable. The task of fitting all of his life and all of our love into one small newspaper column was exhausting, so we traded our pencils for pillows and gave up for the night. \n\nA few hours later, unable to sleep, I rolled over to see a small beam of light coming from downstairs, and decided to follow it. I found my sleepy-eyed father furiously scribbling notes on a stack of white index cards. Between the light blue lines were favorite stories, memorable quotes, and beloved quirks. My dad handed me a stack, and as the dark sky faded into morning, our collection of cards finally created the outline of something familiar—someone familiar. \n\nI imagine the Apostle John sitting down to translate the encounters he’d had with Jesus into suitable words. To him, Jesus was not a faraway character, but a trusted friend and beloved Savior. Writing these words, this Gospel account, John probably recalled intimate details about Jesus—the way He smelled, what His favorite foods were, the sound of His laugh. He could clearly call to mind the expressions his friend made when feeling tired or excited or somber. Yet, John undertook the task of assembling words to describe the heaven-sent Son of God to those of us who didn’t know Jesus in the flesh.\n\nJohn must have had a wealth of stories to choose from when deciding how to open his eyewitness account. But, through the Holy Spirit’s inspiration, this dear friend of Jesus begins his narrative with the thing that identified Jesus most: \n\n“In the beginning was the Word,\nand the Word was with God,\nand the Word was God.”\n-John 1:1\n\nAfter years of witnessing Jesus’ parables, miracles, and interactions firsthand, John presents Jesus as the Word—a tangible love letter from God. Jesus did not come to merely deliver a message from God—He Himself is the message. \n\n“The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.” -John 1:14\n\nThe Apostle John’s words are not only the beginning to another chapter in the Bible; they are the beginning to understanding who Jesus is. He is our promised Savior. He is the one who has been with God from the beginning. He is the Word.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nText: John 2:1-25, Psalm 104:14-15, 1 Peter 4:11\n\nI have always wondered why Jesus gave permission to not believe on account of Himself alone. After all, wasn’t it He, who claimed to be the way, the truth, and the life? That no man comes to the Father except through the Son? (John 14:6). Why then, did Jesus Himself say, “If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me; but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works” (John 10:37,38). Even if, Jesus said. Even if you cannot believe His words, believe the works of His hand.\n\nPastor and author Tim Keller calls Jesus the Lord of the wine, the feast, the party, and basically, the greatest time ever. We know this because His very first miracle—the first work of His man hands—was the turning of water into wine. Nay, the best wine. And the disciples marveled, John tells us; they believed in Him (John 2:11). It was because of a miracle that His disciples believed in Him, and it was on account of His miracles that many came to Him. \n\nI find it hard to trust sometimes. Don’t you? It seems sometimes that God is intricately interested in the plans and futures of so many others, while He feels far off from me. His presence feels not as near and His words sound not as bright. I find it hard to believe Him in those moments. It’s much easier to believe the God who answers my prayers, clears my ways, and makes straight my paths. It’s easier to believe the God who is there. \n\nI think Jesus knew this. In our common vernacular, I imagine His words sounded something like this: “If you cannot believe me (even though I’m doing these works right in front of you), can’t you believe on the evidence of me?” \n\nI don’t know whether Jesus was disappointed with the people for being incredulous at what played out in front of their eyes, in their skepticism and doubt. But sometimes, when God feels far from me, I remember the glory of Jesus and imagine these words to be more tender than perhaps He meant them. I imagine He knows to believe is hard enough, and even harder when our hearts have grown hard and our hearing dull, and this is why He worked miracles during His short time on earth. He wanted so deeply for the people to believe and see and understand and come and follow Him. \n\nRecently, at Christmas, we celebrated the coming of God to earth not only as man, but as baby. That baby grew into a man, changed water to wine, healed blind eyes, raised the dead, commanded the storm to be silent, and then He died an unjust and brutal death. But this can never be the end of our gospel story, because the most miraculous event comes after: His own resurrection and the proffered gift to us of eternity with Him. Jesus is one long succession of miracles, from birth until death and then life again. His glory is on display from the beginning of time until now, this very second, even in my doubt and my struggle with belief.\n\nI know so many of us struggle to believe with all our hearts that all Jesus’ words and love are true. But do you see His miracles? He didn’t do them for the healed, calmed, and raised alone. He did them for you and for me, and for all humanity. His best glory is the belief of His children.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: John 3:1-36, Ezekiel 36:25-27, 1 Timothy 2:5-6\n\nJohn 3:16 wins the prize for the most well-worn verse in the Bible. Scribbled on bathroom stalls, held high on signs at basketball games, or added to the gear of NFL quarterbacks, John 3:16 is seemingly everywhere. When things become familiar, they sometimes lose their ability to “wow” us. But we still need John 3:16.\n\nIn John 3, we find Jesus in a clandestine conversation with Nicodemus, a Pharisee and influential Jew (v. 1). Nicodemus was trying to wrap his well-educated, powerful brain around the fact that the Savior of His people didn’t look like, act like, or teach like Nicodemus thought he should. What Nicodemus was really wrestling with was the gospel. \n\nI’ve always had a soft spot for Nicodemus, probably because I’ve stepped into the ring and gone a few rounds with the gospel myself. There is a tiny corner of my mind and heart that gets it: I am a sinner, deserving of eternal separation from a holy God. Through His death on the cross, Jesus paid the penalty for my sin and made a way for me to be reconciled to the Father (Romans 6:23). But I struggle to convince my whole self that the gospel can be this simple. \n\nSurely, I need a lot of good works to save me. I mess up so often, God must have changed His mind about me. Maybe if I run myself ragged, involving myself in every possible ministry, I will please God.\n\nThese are the things I tell myself nearly as often as John 3:16 shows up on the side of a semi-truck. It’s what we see when we read between the lines when Nicodemus said to Jesus, “But how can anyone be born when he is old?. . . Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born?” (John 3:4). \n\nA few short verses later, we see Nicodemus finally collide with gospel truth: \n\n“For God so loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.” -John 3:16\n\nThis is so good! Let’s keep reading: \n\n“For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.” -John 3:17\n\nWhen I try to create a list of requirements for my salvation, I do so out of fear and forgetfulness—like Nicodemus. I’m fearful of being punished and forgetful of God’s character. But God loves us so much! That’s why He sent Jesus here—not to condemn us but to save us. His perfect plan for salvation is laid out for us in John 3:16-17. \n\nMay these words from our Savior never grow stale in hearts and minds, and may we never grow tired of hearing them.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: John 4:1-54, Isaiah 55:1-3\n\nI wonder if she spotted Him from a distance, a man sitting at the well alone—her well, the one she visited daily. I wonder if, as she drew closer, she could make out Jesus’ face and recognize His nationality. A man—a Jewish man—sitting at her well?\n\nShe approached, probably confused. Maybe even a bit afraid. Then, Jesus spoke to her.\n\nIn this story from John 4, Jesus broke through at least three cultural and social barriers of His time:\n\n1. He spoke to a woman, and traditionally, Jewish men were not to be seen conversing with women.\n\n2. He spoke to a Samaritan, and as the Scripture says, Jews had no dealings with Samaritans at the time (v. 9).\n\n3. He spoke to a woman He knew was an “adulteress”—a woman who had more than one husband and was with a man she wasn’t married to.\n\nYet, Jesus spoke to her. A woman. A Samaritan. A sinner.\n\nAnd He didn’t just say hello. Over the course of their brief and profound conversation, He offered her the gift of a lifetime: living water, eternal life. “But whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty again,” Jesus said to her (v. 14).\n\n“Sir,” she said, “give me this water, so that I won’t get thirsty and come here to draw water” (v. 15). \n\nThere she was, standing beside the Messiah in the flesh, and she didn’t fully understand what He was telling her. She took His offer of living water literally. She didn’t get it—not yet.\n\nI love this part so much because it paints such a real and beautiful picture of grace. You don’t have to fully “get it” to receive it.\n\nThat part is hard for me, a lifelong Christ follower, to accept. Unlike the Samaritan woman, I have the knowledge. I like to think that I know Jesus and His story, that I know the right answers and theology. But this story says the gift of Christ is for anyone who wants to receive it—no matter how little you know, how little you have been taught, or how wayward you have lived. Grace reminds us how level the playing field is. \n\nThe Samaritan woman wanted what Jesus offered. She knew this if she knew nothing else. “Give me this water,” she said. And that’s all she had to say.\n\nThat’s all we have to say, too. From the woman frantically checking all her Bible-study boxes to the woman buried under the weight of past sin and shame, this promise is for all of us. Because we’re all thirsty. We’re all weary. We are all desperate for the Jesus who stands at the well offering the exact and only thing we need.\n\nGive me this water, we say, breathless and tired. And He does.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kim Cash Tate\n\nText: John 5:1-47, Exodus 20:8-11, Luke 6:5, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18\n\nI’ll never forget the day I sat down to study my Bible and discovered my toddler had beaten me to the pages. Scribble marks adorned two chapters in Luke—big loopy scribbles in permanent blue ink. “Oh, no!” reverberated within. This was my favorite Bible, the one I spent time with daily over a hot cup of coffee. I was learning to do inductive study with this Bible and marking key words with care. I’d cringe if I had to erase a bit of colored pencil, knowing it wouldn’t be clean. But this was more than a smudged word. Two entire pages had been ruined.\n\nI sat my little girl on my lap to explain gently that she couldn’t color in mommy’s Bible. She’d meant no harm, of course, but this was a teachable moment. She simply couldn’t go around taking pen to paper in books around the house.\n\nBut in that moment the Lord graciously spoke to my heart. My daughter hadn’t taken a pen to any other books, only this book. She was modeling what she’d seen.\n\n“Sweetie, were you ‘studying’ like Mommy?”\n\nShe smiled, nodding her head big.\n\nIt became my teachable moment. Instead of focusing on “the rules” or my own angst over the pages, I could see the bigger picture. God had been moving in my little girl’s heart, drawing her to His Word. She wanted to interact with it in the only way she knew how. Lifting my focus helped me to see God at work, which changed everything.\n\nIt’s often easy to miss God’s hand at work, just as many did when Jesus walked the earth. I’m astounded when I read of the man Jesus healed by the pool of Bethesda, because of the scene afterward. People had seen this man laying around for thirty-eight years, and suddenly he was walking. Yet, no one said, “Wow! What happened? How were you cured?” No one praised God that he’d been delivered from decades of infirmity. Instead, the healed man is chastised for carrying his pallet on the Sabbath. And the Jewish leaders want to know, not who cured him, but who had the audacity to tell him to pick up his pallet and walk with it (John 5:12).  \n\nJesus, the Son of God, was there among them. A miracle had been done in their midst. Yet, focusing on the rules of the Sabbath, they missed the Lord of the Sabbath.  \n\nHow often do we do the same? How often are we so focused on one side of a circumstance that we miss God’s purposes altogether?\n\nJesus is the Author of life. And He brings not only life, but light, grace, and glory into that which seems dead, dark, and overwhelming (Acts 3:15; 2 Corinthians 4:6). We’re told to walk by faith and not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7) because when our eyes are faith-filled, we see the divine. We see God. \n\nJesus is always working, in every facet of our lives and the lives of those around us. Let’s pray to keep our eyes fixed on Him, so we can behold every moment.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: John 6:1-71, Acts 3:22-23, Psalm 29:10-11\n\nThe day after Jesus miraculously multiplied loaves and fish, the crowd He fed went looking for Him. They loaded into boats and stalked Jesus across the Sea of Galilee. When they found Him, Jesus knew the real reason they had come: “You are looking for Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate the loaves and were filled. Don’t work for the food that perishes but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you” (John 6:26-27).\n\nThe crowds didn’t yet understand the meaning of the Bread Jesus spoke of, so they took Him literally and hoped He would perform the miracle again. They begged, “Sir, give us this bread always!” (v. 34).\n\nIt sounds demanding, right? A little superficial? How could these people stand before the Son of God who offered them eternal life and demand more barley loaves instead?\n\nIt sounds ridiculous, but it also sounds familiar. I’ve done this before with my prayers and requests. I have often begged for bread (and when I am asking Him for bread, it’s the lower-case bread). I am asking for what I want instead of Jesus Himself. Because, admittedly, what I want is often not Jesus.\n\nOur conversations might go something like this:\n\nMe: I want a new job! I hate this one!\nJesus: Here is contentment. It will put your soul at rest. This is what you need. Not a new job.\n\nMe: I want a husband now because everyone else I know is getting married!\nJesus: Here is trust. Trust in me and our relationship will deepen.\n\nMe: I don’t know what to do. Give me a sign!\nJesus: Here I am. My Spirit lives inside of you, guiding you all the time.\n\nI need the same explanation the crowd did that day when Jesus said, “I am the bread of life.”\n\nThe Bread of Life is so much more than the bread I ask for. It endures (v. 27). It gives life to the whole world (v. 33). It is given freely to those who believe (v. 29). Those who eat it will abide in Christ, and Christ will abide in them (v. 56).\n\nThe true miracle of the Bread of Life is that Jesus is all we need. All that other stuff we are hoping will fill our bellies up? It is nothing compared to Christ Himself.\n\nAfter a bit of refining and a lot of grace, my hope is that we will look up one day and realize that our prayers for perishable things can be simplified into one prayer. May we grow to want only one thing and passionately learn to pray, “Give us Jesus, always!”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kim Cash Tate\n\nText: John 7:1-53, Leviticus 23:39-41, Joel 2:28-29\n\nWhen I was a young girl, I loved to visit my father’s elementary school. He was the principal, and being the principal’s daughter made me feel special. I especially loved the times he sent me on errands. I would walk into the cafeteria or library, looking like any other student. But when the staff learned who I was—and that I’d been sent by my father, the principal—it made all the difference. All that he represented was attached to me.\n\nI love that the book of John sets itself apart from the other Gospels in the way it showcases Jesus as the Son of God. While Matthew, Mark, and Luke together have a handful of instances in which Jesus refers to Himself as “sent” by God, John records more than thirty. As Jesus talked to the crowds—and in particular, to the Jewish leaders—He used some version of these words: “Him who sent me… the One who sent me.” \n\nJesus’ choice of words was purposeful. The Jewish people knew that God had promised to send a Savior. It’s amazing to me that Jesus would tell them so plainly, so many times, that He was the “sent” One. In chapter 7 alone, those words appear five times:\n\n“My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me” (John 7:16).\n“but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him, He is true… ” (John 7:18).\n“I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me” (John 7:29).\n“For a little while longer I am with you, then I go to Him who sent Me” (John 7:33).\nAnd this one:  “I have not come of Myself, but He who sent me is true…” (John 7:28).\n\nGod the Father had been true to His promise. He had sent His Son for the salvation of mankind.  Yet, many who walked and talked with Jesus—who heard Him testify repeatedly that He was the sent One—did not believe.\n\nSo many precious truths are repeated this way throughout the Bible, and I can’t help but wonder at just how often I’m slow to believe them. For instance, while some version of “Do not fear” appears hundreds of times throughout Scripture, there are still countless circumstances arising in day-to-day life that tend to stoke fear deep within my heart. The Bible is replete with assurances of peace and joy despite what’s happening around us. But how long does it take to believe those assurances in a given situation? God trumpets His love for us, unconditional and eternal, a love unsurpassed by any human love we could ever experience. Yet, when we feel the sting of rejection from a friend or loved one, we suddenly feel alone.\n\nGod keeps His word. If a promise is given just once in the Bible, He is faithful to fulfill it. By His grace, He often repeats those promises, giving added assurance to our hearts. With faith, we can stand on those promises and believe, because there is another promise that’s often repeated: our God is true (John 7:28-29). \n\nNo matter how many promises God has made to us, they are all made complete in Jesus. He was sent from God for our salvation, making us daughters of the King. We can believe Him. And when we do, receiving His promises as His children, we bring Him glory (2 Corinthians 1:20). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nText: John 8:1-59, 1 John 1:5-7, Romans 2:25-29\n\nI used to be a morning person, when mornings used to be quiet, solitary, slow. This year they’ve been abrupt, noisy, shoving—everything mornings should not be. I am disgruntled while I tie my shoes. It’s barely past 5am. I know mothers and wives and fathers and farmers and workers all over the world wake up this early, but I am self-employed and childless and have convinced myself I’m owed uninterrupted sleep until at least 6am. Our dog does not agree, and in fact, seems to think the fastest way to my heart right now is through her leash. She noses me until I relent and meet her at the front door.\n\nOutside, the moon is a pregnant belly, super and bright, shining the whole still-dark neighborhood over. How strange, I think, that the Son of God would call Himself the “light of the world,” when the most constant earthly source of light disappears every night, then reemerges as varying sizes and shapes, a mere reflection of the original source. \n\nBut this morning I remember the pillar of fire by night and the cloud by day (Exodus 13:21-22); I remember the star shining in the east (Matthew 2:1-2), the day the sun stood still (Joshua 10:12-13), and the day the earth went dark (Matthew 27:45-54). I think about how the God of the universe created the orbs and commands them even now. He is the One who sets clouds the size of a man’s fist in the sky and makes it rain for forty days and forty nights (Genesis 7:11-12). Storms cease at the sound of His voice (Mark 4:35-41). \n\nJesus tells us, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life” (John 8:12). But the kind of of light He offers, is not of the natural, earthly sort. His light is supernatural and He freely offers it to whomever would follow Him.\n\nYes, Jesus is the light of the world, but when our hope is in anything or anyone other than Him, the world can go grow terribly dark in a hurry. I tend to believe Jesus is near and present when I can clearly see His hand at work in my life. But when I cannot see Jesus at work in my life, He seems absent, distant and busy, too tied up with more important things—more important people—than me.\n\nBut this morning, the supermoon shines a deceptive light on my path, blue, dim, shadowed. Not sunlight, but still of the sun—whether I can see it or not. Walking with the light of the world is like that, too, I think to myself. I am still walking in darkness but I know the light exists. \n\nI come back home to a still, dark, quiet house, with a somewhat less rambunctious pup. She snores beside me on the floor and I drink my coffee slowly, quietly. I have the light of life, I think to myself, even today, in this season that feels dark in many ways. I have the light of life because I follow Jesus, and He never fails to shine, even when His light feels hidden by this world and the brokenness within it. \n\nHe is the One, true light of this world—the sun pales in comparison to the light of His presence. Even darkness is not dark to Him (Psalm 139:11-12).\n\nI light a candle and the room, once dark, is light again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: John 9:1-41, Genesis 2:7, Romans 1:18-20\n\nI believe in Jesus with every cell He created in me. I know He’s the only hope for those who are adrift from His love and truth. And yet, when it’s time to share the gospel, sometimes my palms start to sweat.\n\nWhat if I take a detour off the Romans Road?\nWhat if I create more confusion than clarity?\nWhat if I get snagged on questions about the finer points of propitiation?\nWhat then?\n\nTucked here in John 9, we find a remarkable story about hope, healing, and the beautiful simplicity of the gospel. At the center of the story is a man born blind. Surely, every time he glanced toward something his eyes could not see, he was reminded of his brokenness and need for a Healer. \n\nWhen we come face to face with our inability to be holy as God is holy, or to “fix” ourselves, we realize our need for a Savior. We try to go a day without sinning and fail before our feet hit the floor, once again realizing just how broken we are.\n\nThen the God who healed this man’s eyes lifts ours.\n\nAfter his miraculous healing, the man is pressed by the religious establishment about his encounter with Jesus. He doesn’t debate the points of the Law, or drop a truth bomb, leaving the room in stunned silence. He simply tells his story. Pay attention. It sounds like the chorus of one of the Church’s sweetest anthems.\n\nHe answered, “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.” -John 9:25\n\nThis man didn’t have Jesus all figured out. He couldn’t explain a God willing to break tradition on the Sabbath He created. He couldn’t reconcile the Pharisees’ perception of God with the reality of his encounter with Jesus, but he did know one thing: “I was blind. Now I see.” He was preaching the gospel. \n\nWhatever else the gospel is, it most certainly is this: “I am a great sinner and Christ is a great Savior.” \n\nThose words were penned by John Newton, writer of the hymn “Amazing Grace.” What the blind man said before the Pharisees, Newton transformed into an anthem for the ages. He cuts to the quick of both our deep need and our source of hope. Like dead eyes revealed this man’s need for a healer, our sin reveals our need for a Savior. Both needs are met Jesus in alone.\n\nThe Pharisees simply could not stand against the undeniable testimony of the the man who had been healed. So radical was his transformation that his friends and neighbors declared him a changed man, “No, he only looks like him” (John 9:9).\n\nFriends, the gospel is not a treasure to be hoarded. The call on each of our lives is to shout it from every rooftop, whisper it in every coffee shop, declare it to every fellow sinner (Matthew 28:16-20). But how? Maybe it’s as simple as Jesus rubbing mud on a blind man’s eyes. \n\nWhen we simply put the story of God’s grace in our own lives on display, we declare, “I was blind. But because of Jesus, now I see.” This is our anthem of hope, and it’s hard to deny hope. We don’t have to have all the answers; our explanations won’t woo others to Jesus. But the aroma of Christ Jesus in us will. It’s His healing presence in our own lives that draws the lost and the blind to the One who brings healing.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: John 10:1-42, Micah 2:12-13, Numbers 27:16-17\n\nAs an Army brat, I did a lot of following when I was a child. Along with my two sisters and my mother, we followed my dad from station to station, Army base to Army base. We moved every few years from the time I was born until the time my father retired when I was sixteen years old. It was an adventure, a privilege, and at times, it was the worst. We didn’t get to follow orders when we wanted to; we followed them when they were given.\n\nWhen I think about my life as a Christian, I often assume it’s going to be like my life as an Army brat: God gives the orders; I follow. His leadership is cold, indifferent, and ultimately, His orders exist to serve His purposes alone, not my good. My feelings, fears, and preferences aren’t considered. I am not consulted; I am told, sent, and left to deal with the emotional fallout on my own. \n\n With that picture as my guide, my feelings toward God become a deadly cocktail of fear, hurt, and distrust. I’m left wondering if He even loves me.\n\nThankfully, through Scripture, God gives us an entirely different picture of how He leads us in this life. And that picture, time and time again, is not of a cold General leading unsuspecting troops into battle, but of a Good Shepherd tending to His flock, caring for their needs, guiding their grazing.\n\nI have to admit, I couldn’t tell you the last time I saw a sheep in a field. But a little internet detective work revealed this: sheep rely heavily on their incredible range of peripheral vision—they can even see behind them without turning their heads. But their depth perception is so poor, they literally cannot see what lies right in front of their noses.\n\nI can say with conviction that these things are true of me, too. It’s easy for me to look to the past behind me, and to the side at what other people are doing. But when I look out in front of me, everything is incredibly hazy. If I’m honest, most of the time, I have no idea where I’m going.\n\nGod knows this about me. He knows I have a weak sense of vision, and so He guides me with His voice. He speaks in many ways, and even when I fear He is silent, Scripture reminds me of just how near He really is: providing for me, leading, renewing, and comforting me (Psalm 23).\n\nThis is the love of the Good Shepherd in action. With Scripture as my guide, I can see God as He truly is. I can learn from the posture of the sheep: I can follow and rest. I can take in beauty and comfort, even in seemingly dark times. I can love the Shepherd, and trust that no one will ever snatch me from His hands (John 10:28).\n\nThere are times when I’d still prefer to follow a god who sends orders via envelope or email, telling me explicitly where to go and what to do next. But that’s not real relationship. The direction and assurance I seek—that each of us need—are found solely in Jesus, the Shepherd-God. \n\nWe move toward Him, not only because we want to, but because He is the only Way. His voice is the only one we were meant to follow.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: John 11:1-57, Daniel 12:2-3, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-14\n\nJohn’s Gospel invites readers to “come and see”—not just to hear Christ’s words, but to engage with Him, to “come and see” who Christ is. This was the way of Christ Himself. When His followers had questions, when they were troubled about the world, Christ invited them to come and see the answer: Him.\n\nWhat is the answer to sin, death and darkness? Christ. Won’t you come and see? \n\nThe phrase “come and see” appears four times in the Gospel of John, and the pattern that appears is this: when we see Christ and what He has to offer, we see life, but when we see what man offers, we see death.\n\n“Come and you’ll see,” He replied. So they went and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day. It was about 10 in the morning (John 1:39).\n\n“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Nathanael asked him. “Come and see,” Philip answered (John 1:46).\n\n“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did! Could this be the Messiah?” (John 4:29).\n\nIn all three instances above, we are invited to “come and see” Christ as the Messiah, to see what He is doing. In contrast, when we focus on what we see in the world, all we’ll find is death and darkness.\n\nIn John 11:34, Jesus asks after his friend Lazarus, saying, “Where have you put him?” “Lord,” they tell Him, “come and see.” But this “come and see” doesn’t point to Christ; instead it points to death.\n\nDeath is all this world has to offer. The only solution to sin and darkness is Christ Jesus. When Christ bids us “come and see,” He shows us life. When the world bids us “come and see,” we find a man laid in a tomb. We find death. \n\nThe next verse, verse 35, tells us that “Jesus wept” for his friend Lazarus. Death has struck a blow, and Jesus weeps to see sin and its consequences in a fallen world. But His tears are not an indication of defeat. Instead, there at Lazarus’s tomb, Christ wages war on death, arresting the powers of death and decay, and reversing them. \n\n“I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in Me, even if he dies, will live. Everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die—ever. Do you believe this?” -John 11:25-26\n\nThe raising of Lazarus from the dead is a foreshadowing of Christ’s work on the cross, which will come just a short time later (John 19-21). Defeating death once and for all, Jesus Himself is raised from the dead. This time, it is Mary Magdalene who weeps, while looking for the body of her Lord. Jesus asks what she is seeking, then simply calls her by name: “Mary” (John 20:16). He’s calling us too (Isaiah 43:1).\n\nWe have seen who Christ is. The light has come. “Life was in Him, and that life was the light of men” (John 1:4). The invitation is no longer just to “come and see,” but to follow Him, to walk with Him (John 8:12). Now that we have seen the light, we are called to abide in it and bear witness to its power and goodness. \n\nBehold Christ, the light of life. Love Him. Walk with Him.\n\n",

The answer to almost every major question really is Jesus.\n\nUnfortunately, one of my sons has a terrible time remembering names. Our conversations might go a little something like this:\n\nMe: Who came to save us?\nMy boy: God!\nMe: Who died on the cross for our sins?\nMy boy: God!\nMe: And what’s God’s other name?\nMy boy: [Silence]\n\nI’m constantly wondering how he can possibly forget the Great Sunday School Answer. But when I read through John chapter 12, I’m see he’s not the only one.\n\nModern culture often wants to distance Jesus from God, to turn Jesus into a great teacher or a prophet. If He were just a good teacher, a great man—anything but the Son of God, and God incarnate—then we could pick and choose from what He said. We wouldn’t have to submit to Him.\n\nWhen we read the New Testament we see this is not just a figment of modern culture; it was a part of first-century culture, too. The religious elite attacked Jesus for blasphemy because they understood that He was claiming to be God. They knew what Jesus meant when He said He was God’s “only Son” (John 3:16), doing His Father’s will (John 6:38). Up until that point, no one else would have dared to call God their “Father” (John 5:18).\n\nIn this chapter, we again see Jesus fulfilling His calling as the Son of God: speaking life to all who will listen, shining light in the darkness, and bringing glory to God the Father. We even catch a glimpse of the relationship between God the Father and God the Son, as Jesus wrestles with what’s to come:\n\n“Now My soul is troubled. What should I say—Father, save Me from this hour? But that is why I came to this hour. Father, glorify Your name!” \n\nThen a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again!” (John 12:27-28).\n\nIt is a precious insight into the Trinity, our relational God. He has come at great cost to Himself in order to seek relationship with us, offering us the resurrection and the life. \n\nNo wonder Mary was led to worship Him. No wonder the Greeks wanted to see Jesus (John 12:20). No wonder the crowd sang, “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord” (Matthew 23:39). God—Jesus—truly is the answer to our most important questions, the remedy for our greatest fears.\n\n",

What comes out of our mouths when life squeezes us in its vise grip is the stuff we’re really made of. \n\nAt the Last Supper, we find Jesus in the tightest situation imaginable. He knows unthinkable suffering is right around the corner. Since His disciples are still presuming He is going to lead a government takeover, it’s a burden He must carry alone. Jesus knows there will be no military coup. He will secure the Kingdom victory, but through suffering—not conquest. \n\nIn that crucible of suffering, the real Jesus shines through. We don’t catch one hint of self-pity or bitterness in His words or actions. He would soon be poured out on our behalf, yet Jesus remained faithful to who He is and what He came to do.\n\nHe never stopped teaching. Using bread and wine for an object lesson of cosmic consequences, Jesus taught truths in advance that His disciples would not grasp until He was gone (John 12:16). As modern Christ followers, we have access to this Upper Room as a classroom. We’re able to wrestle with the lessons of His atoning sacrifice every time we come to take communion. \n\nHe never stopped serving. Knowing that within hours His own would be nailed to a tree, Jesus took the time to wash His disciples’ feet. “So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done for you” (John 13:14-15). This moment wasn’t mere ritual. Jesus was showing them how to care for one another after He departed.\n\nHe never stopped loving. When I study the Last Supper, I am most grateful for this truth: “Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end” (John 13:1). To the end. Our Savior never stopped loving the undeserving, helpless sinners He came to die for. He never chose hatred or contempt. He didn’t shame or ostracize Judas, the one who would sell Him out for a few silver coins. Instead of pointing His finger at him, Jesus offered him bread.\n\nWhen hard-pressed on every side, Jesus never resented the sacrifice He chose to make on our behalf. It was in His suffering that our Savior displayed His true strength.\n\n“But he was pierced because of our rebellion,\ncrushed because of our iniquities;\npunishment for our peace was on him,\nand we are healed by his wounds.”\n-Isaiah 53:5\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nText: John 14:1-31, Isaiah 28:16, Ezekiel 1:26-28\n\nI don’t know about you, but I tend to over-analyze things. Sometimes even a small decision can lead to an overwhelming list of pros and cons. In my heart of hearts, I know I want pizza for dinner, but maybe I should want the soup, or the salad… or the chicken. You’d think dinner would be a simpler decision. (The answer is pizza. Always choose the pizza!) When it’s so easy to complicate the tiniest of decisions, how do we come to any sense of peace and assurance about the bigger matters in life?\n\nThe Christian faith is simple and complicated at the same time. We are called to have faith like a child (Matthew 18:3), and also to grow toward maturity (Hebrews 6:1). In some places the Word of God seems so straightforward, and yet the psalmist declared some knowledge too wonderful and lofty to grasp (Psalm 139:6). The seeming contradiction between this simplicity and complexity speaks to the mystery of the gospel. But when it comes to our salvation, Jesus doesn’t want there to be any confusion.\n\nIt’s funny—and oddly reassuring—just how human the disciples were. By the time we come to John 14, they were well into their ministry alongside the Son of God. You would think after all the miracles and face-to-face teachings from Jesus, they would have learned the basics. But when Jesus talked about the way to heaven, the disciples seemed totally and utterly confused!\n\nSo, once again, He spoke clearly, telling them:\n\n“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. If you know Me, you will also know My Father. From now on you do know Him and have seen Him.” -John 14:6-7\n\nJesus spells it out for His disciples—and for us, too—so that there can be no misunderstanding. He is the way to freedom. He is truth and life.\n\nThere are parts of our faith that are truly complex because we love and serve an infinite God. There are some questions that don’t have simple answers. The gospel is like an intricately woven tapestry, with threads intertwining in hidden places, forming the most epic story of all time. God gives us minds to think and question and analyze these mysteries with humility, so that we might grow in our understanding and love.\n\nBut, some parts of the Word are crystal clear. \n\nJesus came to our world in the form of a man so that His followers could see, know, and touch the love of their Father. In a world full of confusion, God wants His people to know exactly who He is.\n\nIf you know Jesus, you know the Creator of all and the way to salvation. As you “work out your salvation with fear and trembling” (Philippians 2:12), may you find peace in the straightforward declarations and promises of our Lord.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: John 15:1-27, Zephaniah 3:14-17\n\nI’m the queen of focusing on the wrong things.\n\nMy daughter makes an amazing piece of 9-year-old art and declares it dedicated to her mom (that’s me!)—and I silently lament the sea of paper covering the floor and the glue stick smashed into all the creases of the dining room table.\n\nA long-lost friend says she and her family are coming to visit for a weekend—and I spend more time worrying about the condition of the guest room than rejoicing in the long conversations and late-night laughter to come.\n\nMy husband spends hours creating new storage solutions for our mudroom (slash laundry room, slash pantry, slash coat closet, slash place the dog stays during dinner so he won’t eat food off our plates)—and I involuntarily scowl that my tired, dirty, three-compartment clothes hamper will no longer fit. (Three compartments! You can understand my sadness.)\n\nAnd here, in John chapter 15, Jesus says this:\n\n“Remain in me, and I in you. Just as a branch is unable to produce fruit by itself unless it remains on the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without me” (vv. 4-5, emphasis mine). \n\nThis is what He says. But do you know what I hear? I hear, “Bear fruit.” Or, to be more specific, “Hey, you, why aren’t you bearing fruit?” I, the Queen of Focusing On The Wrong Things, read Jesus’ words and hear all of the goal and none of the grace. I want the end but forget the means.\n\nYes, bear fruit. Yes, love others. Yes, give grace to a world that will misunderstand and even hate us. But look back through John 15. Jesus is not commanding His disciples to bear fruit. The command is to remain. When we remain—when we abide in the never-ending, unconditional, forever love of Christ—then the fruit will come. \n\nWe bear fruit when, and only when, we are grafted into the True Vine. His Holy Spirit in us is the fruit producer; we are simply the branches who have the privilege of displaying His fruit.\n\nJesus Christ comes to make us new. He comes to redeem the dead branches that we are and give us abundant life! Remaining in Him—resting, dwelling, abiding in Him—is the only source of our strength, our goodness, our fruit. \n\nLet’s focus our eyes on the True Vine today. Let’s be about the business of remaining in Jesus, and trust His Spirit to be about the business of bearing fruit in our lives. \n\nLord, teach us what it means to remain when all we want to do is produce. Help us to rest in your never-stopping love. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: John 16:1-33, Isaiah 32:14-18, Romans 8:12-17\n\nMost mornings, I go to a local coffee shop in East Nashville where I order my two-dollar coffee, sit in a corner, and try to bang out a few words on my machine. They know my name here. They welcome me in the door, ask how my writing is going, and never give me the slant-eye when my coffee goes cold, while I continue to suck electricity from their walls and Wi-Fi out of their air. Here, it’s easy to pretend that life is all lattes and progress.\n\nBut the reality is, everyone around me is experiencing their own pain. The girl who stops by my table just had a miscarriage. The grey-haired man eating his oatmeal while reading the paper just lost his wife last year. The exhausted, lonely mother at the register keeps trying to order her coffee, but stops to run out the door after her two-year-old escape artist. The newspaper sitting next to me screams its headlines of tragedy: War Rages On! Politicians Still Lie! Poverty Eats Away at the Hungry!\n\nWe’re all acquainted with our own brand of heartache. It’s enough to bring you to the same conclusion as Solomon in Ecclesiastes: “I observed everything going on under the sun, and really, it is all meaningless—like chasing the wind” (Ecclesiastes 1:14).\n\nThis view of suffering is the fare the world offers up to us for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The world tells us that if we’re hurting, it’s up to us to change our circumstances so we won’t hurt anymore. We’re to follow our heart, chase our dreams, and forsake everything—even our responsibilities, family, and God— in order to secure our own happiness in the world. But in the midst of all that noise, Jesus provides a much different view of suffering. \n\nWith some of His last words to His disciples, Jesus predicted that trouble was coming. He said they would be kicked out of the temple—losing the social center of their lives (Luke 21:5-6). They would be ostracized, killed, and separated from one another. But most importantly, He told them to expect these things, to not be surprised when they happened. Grief would be a part of their experience here on earth, just as it’s a part of ours. \n\nBut Jesus doesn’t leave us in our sorrow. He promises to turn our grief into joy (John 16:20). He tells us we’re to have courage because He’s already conquered the evil in this world (John 16:33)—and, in fact, He’s making us a new one (Isaiah 65:17).\n\nThe world tells us to break free from grief because our time here is limited. Jesus invites us to welcome our grief as the precursor to eternity. In that way, our pain is not a state of being that needs to be avoided; it is an access point to the throne of God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: John 17:1-26, Isaiah 42:8, 1 John 5:20\n\nThis has been a difficult week for me. I am heartbroken. I am utterly aching with loss. I feel upside-down in my sadness. Have you ever felt this way? Honestly, I wonder who hasn’t. What is your heart aching for today as you read these verses in John 17?\n\nSometimes when I find myself in the depths, cracking my Bible open is the last thing I want to do. But for some reason, today, I craved falling into Scripture. I felt that God had something for me here, in this passage. And oh, how rich this passage is, especially for the aching heart.\n\nThe hour had come for our Savior. As I read His prayer, I can almost feel His aching, His longing to protect those who’ve come to believe in Him. As He anticipated the events to come, He pleaded with the Father for the disciples He loved:\n\n“Now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to You, Holy Father, keep through Your name those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We are.” -John 17:11\n\nCan you imagine being in the presence of Christ as He is praying for you? Sitting in the same room with Him, hearing Him say just before, “in this world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world,” and then watching Jesus turn His eyes heavenward and, in prayer, put your life and soul into the Father’s care?\n\nWhen I read Jesus’ prayer today, something cracked open. I felt the fervent love He has for me, the fervent love He has for us all. Right after He prayed for the disciples, He prayed for those who will believe (John 17:20). Jesus prayed for you, and He prayed for me, too—for all who would come to trust in Him.\n\nHe knew this world. He lived it, walked it, saw the desperation and the brokenness. He knew what it would mean for us to be here—that we would face a seemingly endless stream of trial and tribulation. Knowing what was to come for His disciples and for who would believe, He said:\n\n“I am not praying\nthat You take them out of the world\nbut that You protect them from the evil one.”\n-John 17:15\n\nHe did not pray for our suffering to end, or for the pain and sorrow to cease. Instead, He prayed for our protection as we face these trials and circumstances. He prayed that we would not face them alone, but with the support of our community and our God.\n\n“May they all be one,\nas You, Father, are in Me and I am in You.\nMay they also be one in Us,\nso the world may believe You sent Me.”\n-John 17:21\n\nThe idea that Jesus is not only near us, but in us—not only for us, but a part of us—brings comfort to my heart as nothing else can. “I in them, and You in Me” (v. 23)—this is His will for the Church.\n\nWhatever you face today, we as believers are one in Him, and this oneness tells the world of the glory of God. Perhaps that is why writing this has felt so healing for me: it has reminded me that I am not alone in heartache. We are all still in this world, though not of it, and whether it is joy or suffering that binds us, God is glorified in our unity.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Not of This World",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Carolyn Denny\n\nText: John 18:1-40, Daniel 7:14\n\nThe hour Jesus was born for had finally come. He’d been predicting it, waiting for it, knowing what it would require of Him: arrest, pain, and death. For anyone else, this would be a crisis moment, to be sure. For the Son of God, it was an opportunity for the most profound display of obedience, love, and humility ever known.\n\nJohn’s account of this night shows us the holiness of Jesus, God incarnate—deliberate, powerful, wise, and gentle. Put simply, He is not of this world. But the people surrounding Him? They proved themselves to be oh-so very human.\n\nAt this point, Judas’ secret sin had finally consumed him. All those months on the road—stealing from the disciples’ treasury, betraying his friends—had prepared him for this moment, and he intended to capitalize on it. Jesus responded as only He can: by declaring His deity, revealing His glory, and protecting His disciples. And even as He submitted to His arrest, Jesus gave Judas one last chance to see His true identity.\n\nPeter was a man of action, refusing to sit around and wait for Jesus to die. He followed his heart, despite Jesus’ teaching and example—despite knowing better. First, he sliced off the soldier’s ear to protect his Lord, then he denied Jesus altogether. His Savior’s response was not one of condemnation, but of grace. He protected Peter, gently rebuked him, and restored him (John 21). He continued to build Peter’s faith, even in His darkest hours.\n\nAnnas was one of the richest, most powerful Jews of his time. There was no way he’d be willing to let some upstart from the outskirts destroy everything he’d spent a lifetime building. Believing Jesus was leading the people away from his agenda, Annas had no problem breaking a few laws to get rid of Him. But Jesus had nothing to hide, no secret life to reveal. So He turned the tables on Annas, subtly challenging the leader’s interrogation of Him (which had been done in secret, and therefore, was against their civil laws). \n\nAs for Pilate, he’d learned not to interfere in Jewish matters and had become skilled at shifting responsibility. To him, this was a Jewish problem for the Jews to work out amongst themselves. But to Jesus, this wasn’t just a Jewish issue but a human one, an eternal one. It was about a Kingdom impacting the whole world and beyond, a Kingdom rooted in Truth.\n\nIn this series of events, John’s Gospel makes one thing clear: our Savior is fundamentally different from this world. His response is never fed by deception or greed or fear, but rather by an otherworldly compassion for His people and command over all circumstances. He will always accomplish His gracious plan, often in unforeseeable ways.\n\nLike the events in John 18, life can seem like one long, dark night, leaving us feeling betrayed, wounded, and scared. It’s easy to relate to Peter’s impulse to fix the situation, or Pilate’s attempts to distance himself from it. But then I see Jesus walking into the darkness, knowing all there is to fear, yet bolstered by confidence in the Father’s plan to rescue all who love Him. \n\nIt’s tempting, perhaps even good, to feel inspired by Christ’s example. But I’m finding I don’t always have the wherewithal to follow Jesus’ lead. I need to lean on Him, push against Him, knowing He will never falter or fail. Seeing His response to such an array of broken people is healing and soul-nourishing for me, a sinner. Our Savior was gentle, trustworthy, and sovereign on the darkest night in history, and He will be so with us today, even now.\n\n",

They stood outside for hours—5 hours, come to think of it—watching their kites soar in the air. They flew kites while singing songs. They flew kites while dancing. They flew kites while running in circles and they even flew kites while lying down. My personal favorite? When they flew kites while singing AND lying down.\n\nAs I sat on a blanket and watched the event unfold, it reminded me of a Billy Graham quote about the wind. You fellow youth group kids of the early 90’s know the one; I’m pretty sure it was spliced into the beginning of a DC Talk song: “Can you see God? You haven’t seen him? I’ve never seen the wind. I see the effects of the wind, but I’ve never seen the wind. There’s a mystery to it.”\n\nBelieving in what we cannot see can be downright hard. Even those who walked the earth with Jesus wanted to see more of Him in order to believe or hold onto belief. The crowds followed Him, pushing in closer and longing to catch a real, live glimpse of the Messiah in action.\n\nMary Magdalene was one who followed Jesus faithfully. Even after His death she went to the tomb, anxious to see the body of her Savior; and when He wasn’t there, she wept. \n\nMary needed to see Jesus. Then He appeared to her there where she knelt crying, and she saw Him and believed! \n\nThe disciple Thomas heard the news that Jesus had risen from the dead. “We have seen the Lord,” the others told him (John 20:24). But Thomas was a doubter, like I’m prone to be. \n\nThomas needed to touch Jesus. “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe” (v. 25). And Thomas touched his hands to Jesus’ hands and believed!\n\nWe can understand our sister Mary and our brother Thomas, can’t we? In the hurry and sorrow and uncertainty of this life, we need a hope we can see and feel. But unlike Mary, we don’t get to see Jesus face to face. And unlike Thomas, we don’t get to put our fingers on His nail-scarred hands. Yes, we can see God’s mercy at work in the world, making broken things new. We can feel the Holy Spirit changing our hearts, softening what once was stone. But the darkest valleys leave our eyes and hands searching for something we can’t seem to find. \n\nJesus knew this would be hard for us. It’s why He gives us faith—to believe. Paul tells us faith is a gift, not something we muster up on our own (Ephesians 2:8). And Jesus calls those who have it blessed (John 20:29). He has also given us His very Spirit to live within us (John 14:26), and His Word to guide us (Psalm 119:105). Though we can’t yet lay eyes on Christ, He lays His hand of mercy on us by the indwelling of His Spirit and the gift of His Word. \n\nThere will be times when we struggle to believe what we cannot see. But the risen Savior is ever near, as alive as He was the day He spoke to a distraught Mary, and the day He beckoned Thomas to touch His side. When we have trouble seeing Him in our lives, we can see Him here, in the pages of His Word. \n\n",

My brain was so clouded by pregnancy hormones and sleep deprivation that I didn’t know what I needed or how to ask for help. \n\nSo Mandy made me pancakes. \n\nMandy and I weren’t friends, exactly. We mostly smiled at each other in the halls of our church, but she called me one evening with this invitation: “Come over tomorrow morning, first thing. Bring your little guy and stay in your jammies. I’m going to make you pancakes.”\n\nNot typically the kind of gal to show up at a stranger’s house in my jammies, I’m surprised I accepted her offer. I’m usually more of a “spiff everything up and look like you have it together” kind of girl. Even so, the next morning we headed over to Mandy’s in our comfies. \n\nThose were the best pancakes of my life. Food eaten on dishes I didn’t have to wash was a lifeline of sorts. That moment of simple compassion stuck with me long after I cleaned (okay fine, licked) my plate and headed home. \n\nYears later I was surprised to find a similar story in John 21. \n\nAfter a night of fruitless fishing to punctuate the best and worst months of their lives, Peter, James, John, and a handful of other disciples found themselves staring out at the same waves Jesus had walked upon. Everything had changed since then. Jesus had been arrested, crucified, and buried. Their hopes were dashed and they scattered, fearing for their lives. Peter’s grief was compounded by the agonizing memory that he denied the Savior not once, not twice, but three times. \n\nAlmost immediately after everything went so terribly wrong, Jesus started setting it right again. His death was trumped by His resurrection. His scared disciples were refocused by His return. Even Peter’s denials got reversed. \n\nJesus called His fishing friends to the shore. Peter was so anxious to be with his Savior that he jumped right out of the boat fully clothed (John 21:7). When they got to shore, they found that Jesus had made them breakfast. It was a simple gesture that demonstrated profound care and compassion. In His glorified state, Jesus tenderly met His friends’ physical needs before offering an even better portion. \n\nDuring a post-breakfast stroll, Jesus gave Peter not one, not two, but three chances to declare his love. For every denial, Peter got to make a proclamation (John 21:15-17). Though sinned against, Jesus initiated reconciliation and offered tender mercies. \n\nIn this last chapter of John’s Gospel, we see the risen Christ doing more of what He’d done all along: love and serve, invite and forgive. In fact, John ends his account of Jesus’ life by stating there were so many more things that Jesus did, “if they were written one by one, I suppose not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written” (John 21:25). Volume after volume of love and service. Book after book of invitation and forgiveness. \n\nPerhaps emulating Jesus is simpler than we think. Offer grace. Pursue reconciliation. Forgive freely. Whenever possible, love others well by serving them. Pancakes optional.\n\n",

It feels significant, doesn’t it? Even the “men in white robes” acknowledged there was a mystery to Jesus’ comings and goings (Acts 1:10). The way Jesus departed was mysterious; it didn’t make sense. And it was also somehow certain—beyond a shadow of a doubt—according to the tribe of eyewitnesses. \n\nWhen I think about the mysterious and certain things I’ve experienced in my 33 years, my mind immediately goes to Thin Mints® cookies. There have been occasions upon which I have settled into a stack of four or five cookies and a nice book, only to find myself shocked when, as I reach to lift another cookie from my stack, they are all certainly, and mysteriously, gone.\n\nI sometimes daydream when I’m driving on the interstate and suddenly realize I have mysteriously, but quite certainly, missed my exit by three miles. \n\nThen there was the time when the life of our friends’ son was mysteriously, but certainly, spared. He climbed out of a crumpled car that had flipped over several times and wrapped around a telephone pole—yet he walked away with nary a scratch. \n\nGranted, disappearing cookies are far less mysterious than a spared life that, by all practical and scientific realities, should have been taken. Sometimes things are mysterious because we’re not paying attention, and other times they are a mystery because we were never meant to fully comprehend them. Not yet. \n\nThe mystery of the gospel is the latter. Jesus ascended mysteriously into heaven with the words, “It is not for you to know,” fresh on His lips. I love that so much. “But you will receive power,” He continued, “and you will be My witnesses.” And with that, He was taken up “as they were watching” (Acts 1:7-9). It was mysterious, but certain. \n\nOne element of Jesus’ ascension, however, was not mysterious at all: He left with a clear command to get up and go “to the ends of the earth.” To go become a Church. Go spread the good news of His life, death, and resurrection to the entire world. And to go with a parting gift: the power of the Holy Spirit, who would accompany them, and from whom they—and we—would receive power to carry out this not so mysterious commission. \n\nThe book of Acts begins with a heavenly mix of both mystery and certainty, and the combination will dance artfully across all 28 chapters. \n\nThere will be mystery: the things of God’s Kingdom might not seem to add up, as they so often do not by our earthly standards.\n\nAnd there will be certainty: the gospel of Jesus Christ will move with the clarity that only comes from the Father. It will sprout and spread, beginning in Judea, then moving on to Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\n\nThe birth of the early Church is our story. This is where we come from, and it’s where we are going. It’s the story of how we are called to reach out, and how we are called to come together. \n\nCome, read with us—all six weeks, all 28 chapters. Watch the gospel grow legs and walk around. Watch the early Church figure things out, learn how to love each other in community, and discover how to resolve legitimate conflicts with care. See how they give their lives in faith for the Man they watched—with their very own eyes—live, die, rise, and ascend into heaven.The Man they knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, really is the Son of God. The Man the Church still believes will return, just as certainly and mysteriously as He left. \n\nLet’s enter into the book of Acts with hearts full of wonder and minds filled with confidence that the gospel changes everything.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Coming of the Holy Spirit",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessie Minassian\n\nText: Acts 2:1-47, Joel 2:28-32, Psalm 16:8-11\n\nBig grew from small.\n\nTrue to form, God chose a small house, in a small city, in a small country, to be fertile ground for a new gospel Kingdom—the one Jesus had been preaching about, training His disciples to understand, and preparing the Jews to anticipate.\n\nOn the day of Pentecost, the promised Holy Spirit burst forth into this Kingdom, rolling outward and across the city, the nation, and beyond. If the book of Acts is the birth story of the Church, then the coming of the Holy Spirit was the initiating event—the dramatic impetus powering every account we read about in the rest of the book.\n\nSo let’s take a closer look and mull this over a bit. Let’s take the time to appreciate the magnitude of what happened on that very first Pentecost.\n\nHe knew they were distraught, but Jesus assured His disciples that it was necessary for Him to leave the earth. It was for their benefit that He go so that Someone else—the Counselor and Advocate—could come “convict the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment” (John 16:5-8).\n\nJesus taught,\nand the Holy Spirit would illuminate and convict.\nJesus held all knowledge,\nand the Holy Spirit would come and declare those truths to the world.\nJesus had authority over the future,\nand the Spirit would “declare what is to come” (John 16:13).\n\nThe Counselor is not a consolation prize. The Holy Spirit is God’s gift to the Church.\n\nWhile Jesus’ coming was as quiet as a Holy Night, the Holy Spirit’s arrival was radical (Acts 2:2-4), and rightly so. It had to be. The impressive signs—the thunderous sound of wind, tongues of fire, and speaking in foreign languages—were intentionally bold, giving credence to the equally audacious claims the disciples were about to make. But their words would not be their own. When Jesus commissioned His uneducated, ragtag crew, He promised they would “be given what to say at that hour” (Matthew 10:19). The Spirit of God Himself would speak through them.\n\nPeter’s first sermon showcased the power and authority of the Spirit (Acts 2:14-40). He delivered a rousing message, but not because of his religious pedigree or even his training under Jesus. Peter’s soul-splitting message was the Holy Spirit’s glory on display. Without such extravagant signs, the crowd most likely would have dismissed Peter’s outrageous claim that Jesus, the Messiah promised of old, was very much alive.\n\nFrom that first sermon on, the Holy Spirit’s influence spread like holy concentric circles, empowering each new believer to live in a revolutionary way—selling personal possessions to meet the needs of others, sharing meals together, and living in harmony with other sinners (Acts 2:41-47). By the power of the Spirit, the early Church learned to do life together in gracious, generous, and intentional ways.\n\nGod’s new Kingdom was worthy of its epic announcement. As Jesus said new wine must be poured into new wineskins or both will be lost (Mark 2:22), this new Kingdom needed a new paradigm to be effective in spreading the gospel to the nations. God got their attention on that very first Pentecost. He allowed them to see the Holy Spirit on the move, rolling out like a wave across the city of Jerusalem and beyond, filling new believers with a power no one saw coming.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Acts 3:1-26, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, Deuteronomy 18:15-19\n\nBisque. It’s a soup I’d stirred in a bowl, warmed in a saucer, slurped with a spoon, but never actually learned how to pronounce. (Say it with me now: “bisk.”)\n\nThat is, until it was too late.\n\nI was an over-eager high schooler, working my first job as a waitress in a retirement home. My first task at the beginning of each shift was to shuffle my non-slip shoes to each table of residents and recite that evening’s dinner menu. They would all nod in unison at the mention of pork chops and green beans, mashed potatoes and yeast rolls—a rotating list most of them could have recited themselves. Oh, and the soup of the day, you ask? Butternut bisque.\n\n“Butternut bis-kway,” I projected enthusiastically. (In my defense, the “q” makes it look all fancy and foreign and makes me want to speak in an accent, okay?)\n\nEyebrows furrowed and whispers ensued as I skipped confidently into the kitchen to inquire about—what I assumed to be—an exotic new dish I’d get to introduce. But I was soon called out, forced to correct my mistake. Butternut “bis-kway” was, in fact, the same ole butternut “bisk” that had been served every Tuesday for years. Those sweet residents never trusted me with their soup orders again.\n\nIn Acts 3, Peter is calling out the early Church—not because of a silly mistake or mispronunciation, but because of a miracle. When a crippled man known around town for begging at the temple gates encountered Peter, he didn’t get the silver or gold he asked for; he got something much, much better.\n\n“I don’t have silver or gold, but what I have, I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, get up and walk!” -Acts 3:6 \n\nThe man was healed. He could walk. A miracle indeed! But when the crowd around them looked at Peter and John with shocked faces, Peter asked, “Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this?” (Acts 3:12).\n\nWhy was Peter so frustrated? What did the people get wrong?\nThe Israelites misread the miracle. \n\nIn Acts 3, God empowered Peter to give the crippled man more than what he asked for, yet exactly what he needed, surpassing human limitations in doing so. The onlookers’ amazement suggested they believed this extraordinary act was the result of superhuman powers or even a fluke. But Peter set them straight, explaining that everything they witnessed was in line with the Truth he’d been trying to tell them all along.\n\nThey would misunderstand the purpose of miracles altogether. \n\nSince this is the first miracle mentioned in the book of Acts, it’s a pivotal time for the early Church—and you and me—to learn the real deal about miracles. Peter didn’t start a fire with his hands or make the beggar levitate—he healed him. Miracles are given to awaken confidence in God and to heal humanity. Each miracle Jesus and His apostles performed gave a glimpse into God’s plan to restore all things (Acts 3:21). Each act pointed to the truest miracle of all: Christ Himself.\n\nThey would mispronounce the gospel of Christ. \n\nThe crowd watched as the beggar took his first steps, but they themselves would walk away believing and preaching a false gospel. They missed the point entirely; miracles aren’t just for our physical benefit, but for our spiritual benefit. While Peter said, “Get up and walk!” to the beggar, the miracle whispers two more words to us: “to Christ.” \n\nGet up and walk to Christ. \n\nFriends, may we do the same. Instead of skipping away with false assumptions, may our hearts rest in the Truth of the One, true miracle.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: Acts 4:1-22, 2 Corinthians 3:12-18, 1 John 5:12\n\nAnnas and Caiaphas were trying to do damage control—and fast.\n\nThey’d conspired to kill Jesus, and as far as they could tell, the plot had been successful. Of course, a rabble of people claimed Jesus had risen from the dead, but that was preposterous—wasn’t it? All they needed was to imprison a few more people, defame a few more miracles, and then this whole charade would be over for good. Things could get back to normal.\n\nNormal. That sounds familiar.\n\n“I just can’t wait for things to get back to normal.”\n“I’m looking forward to getting back into our regular routine.”\n“Once _______ (fill in the blank) happens, things will settle down again.”\n\nI’ve said these words before. They give me a false sense of control, a sense of hope that soon all the chaos will be behind me and the storm will pass.\n\nI’ll go to great lengths, trying to maintain a sense of normalcy. I’m desperate for it. So desperate that, the more God tries to change my circumstances, the more I gripe and moan and disobey because it hurts to lose what I’ve worked so hard to construct as mine.\n\nAnnas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas (John 18:13). As high priests, their “normal” meant power, prestige, and position. The two worked side by side to make atonement for the people of Israel (Leviticus 16:32-34). Minor celebrities in their culture, they spent their days clothed in beautiful linen garments and purifying the holiest of places within the temple. Without their atoning work of sacrifice, all of Israel would fall away from the Lord into sin and destruction.\n\nThat is, until Jesus.\n\nIf what Peter and John preached was true, then Annas and Caiaphas’ work no longer held any meaning. If Jesus had really risen from the dead, then He was the real High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16), and life as Annas and Caiaphas knew it was over. It meant they were unemployed, power-hungry murderers, with no role to play in society. And rather than accept the fact that they were just as sinful as the people they’d been trying to atone for, they tightened their fists around their own power.\n\nBut Peter and John stood before the Lord’s murderers unfazed. Filled with boldness, eloquence, and joy, they proclaimed the Truth: there is salvation in no one else (Acts 4:12).\n\nHow’s this for a paraphrase: Hey, Annas, Caiaphas. You think you’re making a legacy for yourselves, but this is all going to come to an end. Your efforts to circumvent God are not going to work. And you are just as sinful as you’re afraid to admit. \n\nI imagine Solomon nodding his head: in Ecclesiastes, he reminds us that everything we pursue is absolute futility (Ecclesiastes 1:1-11). And in Corinthians, we’re told that even feeding the poor, having faith, and donating all our money mean nothing unless we have Love Himself (1 Corinthians 13:1-3).\n\nThere is salvation in no one else. Not outside of your marriage. Not inside a better routine. Not with that pair of shoes. Not once you lose fifteen pounds. The storm of change has come into your life, and His name is Jesus. His rival is your sense of control over what’s “normal.”\n\nPeter and John knew that the storm was only just beginning. They could be bold and fearless because they knew, without question, that they were anchored in the only Truth that can sustain the volatile winds and waves of that storm.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Acts 4:23-37, Acts 5:1-16, Deuteronomy 15:4-6, Hebrews 6:13-20\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was scared of the dark.\n\nAt night, I would quicken my step down the hallway when passing a darkened room. My own room was upstairs, and before bedtime, I would run up to dark windows to pull down their pink shades; large trees loomed just outside, holding who-knows-what in the darkness.\n\nI was afraid of what I did not know, and certain that the unknown could, and would, hurt me.\n\nMy heart’s inclination is to treat the story of Ananias and Sapphira like those darkened windows in my childhood bedroom. I want to run past it, afraid to stop and look for fear of what I might find. \n\nThe chief priests and elders were afraid too. They saw the wonders and heard the testimonies brought on by the spread of the gospel, and they demanded that the apostles stop preaching (Acts 4:17). They were afraid of what they did not understand. But the gospel is true even when we don’t believe.  \n\nThe apostles knew this. Their intimate experience of Christ’s salvation so affected them, they not only refused to stop preaching and healing in the name of Jesus, they prayed that the Holy Spirit would equip them to preach and heal all the more (Acts 4:29-30).\n\nAnd so the effects of the gospel continued to spread, in spite of the Council’s warnings. The power of the gospel was so great that this newfound church poured out all they had for the glory of God and the good of their fellow believers. “There was not a needy person among them” (v. 34).\n\nThis was the context in which Ananias approached Peter with a portion of the proceeds from the land he’d sold, and a premeditated lie about the full amount of the sale. Picture that: while the church was literally giving their all—preaching the gospel and being arrested, giving freely and relying individually and collectively on the grace of Jesus—Ananias and his wife cooked up a plan not only to deceive the church, but to deceive God. \n\nThe couple did not fear God as holy. They did not trust God as good. They believed God could be tricked, and they set out to do just that. And we know what became of them: in pretending to give all, they lost all.\n\nBut the story of Ananias and Sapphira isn’t about money. \n\nThis story is not a departure from the stories of gospel power demonstrated in the chapters preceding it—power that healed the sick, fed the hungry, provided for the poor, and saved souls by the thousands. This, too, was the living God at work, and the living God is to be revered as holy and powerful and good, because He is.\n\nI don’t have to be afraid of this holy God the way I was once afraid of the dark. He is not unknown, like the night time darkness lurking outside my bedroom windows. No, our God has intentionally and carefully made Himself known. Through the person of Jesus Christ and through His Word, we are invited to know the real, holy Him. \n\nWe may not fully understand His ways, but we can see His fingerprints on each page of the whole Story. We see them when He gives His covenant to Adam and Abraham and David, and when He pursues His people, though they run. We see them in Jesus’ life and death and in the glory of the resurrection. We see them when we are given forgiveness and mercy, instead of judgment and death. And we see them in this story, too, as God reveals His unquestionable, uncompromising holiness to His people in a powerful way.\n\nHe is holy. And He is wholly good. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nText: Acts 5:12-42, Isaiah 40:6-8, 1 John 2:15-17, John 6:66-69\n\nI have always been enchanted by the glamour, music, and energy of the Roaring Twenties. Naturally, The Great Gatsby is a favorite book of mine. If you haven’t read the book or seen the movie, the plot centers on Jay Gatsby, a man with one goal: to win the heart of the charming Daisy Buchanan.\n\nMr. Gatsby doesn’t consult God about his grand plans to win over Daisy. Rather, he sets out to make himself a new man worthy of her pedigree—a man of fame and fortune. But despite Gatsby’s best efforts, (spoiler alert) he does not ultimately end up with his lady love. And while hundreds—maybe thousands—once attended his infamous parties, Gatsby’s funeral is a lonely affair, and he’s quickly forgotten by most.\n\nHow could someone who worked so hard with such a singular purpose, fail and be forgotten?\n\nWhen we look at the book of Acts, we see the apostles giving everything they have to accomplish a goal. Unlike Gatsby, these men are driven by God’s purpose rather than their own desires. And the outcome couldn’t be more different.\n\nEven with God leading them, the apostles’ journey wasn’t without difficulties. When the apostles started to gain a following for the Lord, the jealous Sadducees imprisoned them. But the plans God had set in motion could not be stopped, and the men were miraculously freed to continue preaching. When dragged before the Sanhedrin, they remained committed to the mission the Lord had called them to, bravely proclaiming:\n\n“We must obey God rather than men.” -Acts 5:29\n\nHonest though the apostles’ explanation was, it didn’t sit well with the Sanhedrin, who’d become intent on killing them (Acts 5:33). But Gamaliel, a wise and respected Pharisee among the council, persuaded the others to leave the men alone. “For if this plan or this work is of men, it will be overthrown; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You may even be found fighting against God” (Acts 5:38-39).\n\nJay Gatsby was a man with plans to make his own name great, but his plans failed and his legacy was forgotten. The apostles, on the other hand, were not working in their own power or crafting their own strategy for success—they were listening to the Lord and joining in His plans as “fellow workers” (1 Corinthians 3:9). Even when the apostles faced imprisonment, beatings, and the threat of death, they were strengthened in the Spirit to endure such trials and to spread the gospel, a teaching with eternal value.\n\nIt’s tempting to follow our own desires apart from God, striving for recognition and trying to make a name for ourselves. We can easily become confused by our own motivations. Are we pursuing this job or relationship to bring glory to God, or to build our own kingdom? Are we walking in our own strength, or by the guidance of the Spirit? \n\nJesus promised that apart from Him, we can do nothing (John 15:5). Instead, we will struggle to build false kingdoms of our own that won’t last and will never fulfill. But thanks be to God, whose plans can never be thwarted! Like the apostles, may we seek to obey Him, rather than man.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Wilbert\n\nText: Acts 6:1-15, Genesis 4:3-7, 1 Timothy 3:8-13, Exodus 34:29-30\n\nWe can disavow the prosperity gospel with our words but still believe it in our hearts. We shake our fists at God, saying, “I did what you told me to and this is how you repay me?” I’ve done this a time or two in my life and am guilty of doing it again as recently as this morning. \n\nStephen was a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit (Acts 6:8). He reminds me of a few other men who came before him: Abraham, Noah, Job—men the Bible tells us were full of faith and for whom things went terribly wrong. I sometimes wonder if being “full of faith” is a prerequisite for all sorts of calamity. Not exactly the way we were told it would turn out, though, right?\n\nCome to Jesus and the things of earth will grow strangely dim.\nCome to Jesus and He’ll make your life better.\nCome to Jesus and His beautiful plan for your life.\n\nThese are true things, but the caveat to the clause should read something like this: \n\nCome to Jesus, die, and then be raised to life with Him eternal.\nComing to Jesus involves a death of self we’d often rather forget. \n\nDid Stephen know this when his name was counted among the first deacons of the early Church? Being full of faith and the Holy Spirit, did he know he’d be arrested just a few short verses later? \n\nCome to Jesus, display His fruit, and stand before the council for your stoning!\n\nI’ve spent a good portion of my Christian life in pursuit of the faith, grace, and power the Holy Spirit brings. I’d be just fine with being known as “that girl”—the one full of faith. But I now know enough about suffering that, as I stand before the council of the world, I’m unsure and wobbly, shaky and fearful. I’ve disavowed the prosperity gospel, yet I’ve believed it all the same. Do this, be like this, follow this, and it will always go well for you. Yes, but… well, what about when it doesn’t? \n\nGod was not in the debt of a man like Stephen or anyone else. It was Stephen—the servant and deacon who performed great wonders in His name—who was indebted to God. We get this backwards all too often. We center our energies on what God owes us, center our beliefs on what we’ve done for Him. While He is a good, faithful, kind, and generous God, He’s no puppet on the strings of our whims. \n\nGod was with Stephen there, in the place of his arrest, before the appointing of his death, and Acts 6:15 tells us, “They saw his face was like the face of an angel.” There’s a certain type of unshakeable peace for those who are the true servants of God, and Stephen knew this before he ever opened his mouth to speak. His peace wasn’t a peace the world could give, and it wasn’t something he could conjure up himself. It was the peace of God, given to a servant of God. \n\nThere is peace for the one who knows there is no bargaining with the God of the universe. \n\nBe full of faith, friends, and full of the Holy Spirit, grace, and power. Do mighty wonders in His name (Psalm 77:14). But do not fear or be surprised when you’re called before the council, when hard things happen, calamity occurs, and difficulties rise. There is a good and strange peace for you there. \n\nWe serve a God whose actions do not depend on our goodness. Let us praise Him for it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: Acts 7:1-53, Genesis 15:13-14, Deuteronomy 18:15\n\nDragged before the Sanhedrin, Stephen’s platform was a courtroom packed with men determined to put an end to the shockwaves caused by Christ’s resurrection. He’d endured a trial shored up by false witnesses and fabricated stories. And now, staring down the barrel of a trumped-up guilty verdict, perhaps knowing he’d be sentenced to death for his faith, Stephen went for the spiritual jugular. \n\n“Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They even killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become. You received the law under the direction of angels and yet have not kept it.” -Acts 7:52-53\n\nStanding before them, Stephen mapped out the long history of idol worship among the Jews. He didn’t have to bribe witnesses or plant evidence to prove that God’s people chronically looked to idols instead of turning to the one true God. The Jews were prone to put their hope in: \n\nTheir promised land instead of the God who created it (vv. 2-3).\nTheir house of worship instead of the intended object of worship (vv. 43).\nTheir law instead of the God who handed it down (vv. 53). \n\nWhen we look at Scripture through a rearview mirror, it’s easy to adopt a posture of chronological snobbery. We read stories like Stephen’s and see the religious leaders through the lens of “us vs. them.” They are the villains of the New Testament. Perhaps when we read Stephen’s sermon, we imagine ourselves in his place, preaching our guts out for the glory of God. But it’s good to remember that we could easily swap places with the judges who condemned him to death.  \n\nIdols have a gravitational pull on our hearts too. There is a tendency among God’s people in every generation to worship something or someone other than the one true God. And we still have a nasty habit of throwing stones toward those who remind us that our own idol worship is futile and sinful. \n\nBut read Stephen’s sermon again. Let it marinate. Stephen’s words map out Israel’s rebellions, but there’s a parallel trajectory telling the story of God’s remarkable faithfulness. \n\nHe was faithful to Abraham, and to Joseph, too (vv. 2-6, 9-10).\nHe never turned His back on Jacob, the deceiver (vv. 12-16).\nHe remained with Moses (vv. 17-36).\n\nThe Israelites may have rejected their human leader as they wandered around in the desert, but God never did. He never has. He never will. \n\nStephen was sharing this key truth with the Sanhedrin: all of humanity—every last one of us—is prone to reject God’s gifts and worship idols instead, prone to hide from the God who made us. That’s been true in every generation since the Garden of Eden.\n\nBefore a call to repentance pierced our own hearts, we also rejected the Truth that Jesus is the Promised Savior we desperately need. But even so, God is faithful and merciful in every season. Therefore, we ought to repent and believe, because Jesus, the Righteous One, was murdered to pay the penalty for all our sins for all time.\n\nOur hope is built on Christ alone—not land, or temples, or laws. The religious leaders may have covered their ears and tried not to listen, but they couldn’t change the truth Stephen died telling: God is faithful. He was with Stephen that day, and He is present with us now. Looking back we see His grace and forgiveness. Looking forward we see His coming rescue.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nText: Acts 7:54-60, Acts 8:1-40, 2 Kings 2:11, Isaiah 56:3-5\n\nAt this point in the book of Acts, God’s Spirit is moving and empowering the members of the early Church to emulate the gospel-bellowing boldness of Peter. They’re fleshing out the declarative promise of Jesus at the beginning of this New Testament story: \n\n“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” -Acts 1:8 ESV (emphasis mine)\n\nAlthough not everyone they witnessed to was so receptive. In his final sermon before the Sanhedrin, Stephen rebuked their stubbornness before God, and he condemned their murdering of Jesus, the Promised Messiah. Being confronted with these truths, the leaders became infuriated, ultimately murdering him as well (Acts 7:51-60). \n\nStephen, likely a relatively new Christ-follower, was also was one of seven men the apostles had chosen to manage and allocate charitable giving, because there’d been some fussing about how some of the needy folks were getting more financial assistance than others. So they chose a few good men (which many congregations now refer to as deacons) to sort it all out (Acts 6:1-4). \n\nTherefore, it stands to reason that Stephen, being a chosen member of the very first deaconate, was a wise, honorable, well-liked kind of guy. And we know for sure that he was passionate about the gospel because Luke literally describes him as “a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit” (Acts 6:5). \n\nSo it’s not hard to imagine the collective shock and grief that rippled through that neophyte church community when he was stoned to death by a militant, anti-Christian mob, simply because of one straightforward sermon about their generational stubborn streak and desperate need for Jesus.\n\nHumanly speaking, it would’ve made sense for the early Church to recoil and then retreat after the tragedy of their dear friend’s gruesome murder. It would make sense if they’d chosen to circle their proverbial wagons and focus on consoling the core group of their fellowship—maybe hire a grief counselor, a crisis manager, and some administrative help to wade through all the insurance and liability issues. \n\nBut they didn’t shrink back in fear. They didn’t go underground and become a secret, self-protective, cultish kind of crew. They didn’t allow a horrific homicide to curb their cause. Nope. They did the exact opposite. \n\nOn that day the church of Jerusalem began to be persecuted, and all the believers, except the apostles, were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. And some religious people buried Stephen and cried loudly for him. Saul was also trying to destroy the church, going from house to house, dragging out men and women and putting them in jail. And wherever they were scattered, they told people the Good News. -Acts 7:51-8:4 NCV (emphasis mine)\n\nTheir commitment to love others for the sake of Christ didn’t get buried with Stephen—it rose up and got bigger! The enemy’s knock-out punch didn’t send them reeling to the canvas; it propelled them out to share the gospel in every corner of the world.\n\nHere’s the ironic thing about hardship: it tends to have the reverse effect on those of us who’ve put our hope in Jesus rather than in our circumstances. Instead of staying down when we’re walloped, God’s people tend to bounce back with more oomph. In fact, church history proves that opposition often works like Miracle Gro on the Body of Christ. The power of the Holy Spirit enables us to have Rocky-like comebacks, pointing to the undefeatable, redemptive power of the Gospel. We may be down, but we’re never out.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Acts 9:1-31, Galatians 1:11-16, 2 Corinthians 3:12-13\n\nCan you imagine if Paul had not done what God called him to do? If he’d had the show-stopping, life-altering moment on the road to Damascus and then went home and holed up, instead of spreading the gospel fervently to the nations? Paul’s miraculous conversion ordained by God would have gone no further than Paul. He himself would have been saved, but what about the countless others he would go on to meet, as well as those of us who read his words today?\n\nPaul had excuses to shrink back and hide away. As soon as he was converted, his ministry was met with opposition. His former cohorts, the Jews, conspired to kill him (Acts 9:23), and his new tribe, Jesus’ disciples, were afraid of him (Acts 9:26).\n\nMy (recovering) people-pleasing heart and I would have had a hard time with this. Whenever I am taking the first shaky steps toward something God has called me to do, it is always the opinions of those closest to me that can make or break me. If they hesitate, or question, or pose all-out opposition, I begin to question what the Lord said. Wait, God, did you really want me to do this? Because so-and-so says this, and so-and-so thinks that… \n\nWe don’t see this type of hesitation in Paul. In fact, we see the opposite. Scripture says Paul immediately began preaching the name of Jesus in the synagogues (Acts 9:20), the very place he once condemned believers and the very place his old buddies hung around. We also read that he preached boldly (v. 28)—as opposed to me, who would have been afraid for my own life, fearfully whispering over and over again the words of what others thought of me. \n\nIf Paul were reading this today, he’d be quick to point out that it wasn’t Paul who made Paul bold. In his letter to the Galatians, he says, “I no longer live, but Christ in me” (Galatians 2:20). It wasn’t Paul’s boldness that set him apart; it was Christ in him who set Paul apart and promised to complete a mighty work in him (Philippians 1:6).\n\nI love what Paul says about conversion in his first letter to the Thessalonians: “For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, in the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance” (1:5). When we believe in Christ, it’s not just a cognitive shift. It’s a full-body, full-heart shift. We are changed completely, as we see in the complete 180 Jesus made in Paul’s heart.\n\nThis truth—that we have the power of the Holy Spirit—is a game-changer when it comes to taking those first shaky steps into ministry and into calling. For if we have the same Holy Spirit that Paul had, whose opinions do we have to fear? What opposition can make us crumble? What power can come against the power that lives inside of us? \n\nSure, we may not always have people cheering us on from the sidelines, but we will always have the Holy Spirit in us, giving us the strength and assurance we need to keep going.\n\nLet’s Praise God for this today—for the grace of His Son, the power of His Spirit, and the promise to complete the good work He began in us, by no power of our own.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: Acts 9:32-43, Mark 5:21-43, Psalm 36:8-9\n\nYears ago, after returning from a mission trip, I joined my church staff for lunch to share my experiences. As I described some patients we’d met while visiting an infirmary, I noticed my tablemates shifting uncomfortably in their seats. I couldn’t blame them. I pushed my plate away, my appetite dissolved in the memory of such deep and devastating need. \n\nWhen faced with the reality of true abject poverty, my instinct is to look away. I’ll never be able to unsee the sick and dying, lying in beds crammed ten to a room, but deep down I don’t want to. Witnessing that cloud of suffering has helped me to see God’s rich mercy and compassion with greater clarity. \n\nIn Acts 9, we meet two people in desperate need of such mercy. Their stories reflect the realities I saw in a third world infirmary and the suffering I see all around me when I force my eyes to look up. The first is Aeneas, a paralytic who’d been bedridden for eight years (v. 33). The second is Dorcas, a disciple of Christ and vibrant member of the Church who’d fallen ill and died (vv. 36-37). Their two stories illustrate a stark juxtaposition. \n\nAeneas was from Lydda, a pagan settlement filled with blue-collar workers.\nDorcas lived in Joppa, a beautiful and thriving port city with a long Jewish history.\n\nAeneas had been bedridden for nearly a decade.\nDorcas had lived a vibrant life of service before becoming sick and dying unexpectedly.\n\nAeneas had nothing to offer, no good works to give, as she’d been immobilized.\nDorcas was “full of good works and acts of charity” (v. 36).\n\nYet, by the power of Christ, both of them were fully healed. \n\nThere are ugly corners of my sinful heart that think healing can be earned, that God’s touch is reserved for the deserving. I see the reality of my own brokenness and worry He’ll turn away from my need. But the contrast between these two miracles proves that Christ’s compassion is not dependent upon our deservedness.\n\nOver and over again during His earthly ministry, and later through His disciples, Jesus offered healing to people on every rung of the social and economic ladder. Each miraculous encounter shows us that His grace is a free gift, extended to both the greatest and least of us. We can’t twist God’s arm to make Him intervene in our lives. Nor can our good works or earthly belongings offer Him anything in return. His work in our lives is always an outflow of His mercy and grace. \n\nAeneas and Dorcas were tied together by a God who saw their suffering and refused to look away. Their stories remind me that I can ask for God’s help and expect Him to respond based on His character, not my merit. He shows compassion to me, not because of what I deserve, but because of who He is. \n\nLet us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. -Hebrews 4:16\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Acts 10:1-48, Isaiah 52:7-10, Galatians 3:13\n\nThe gospel is for everyone. Thanks be to God.\n\nEven when we aren’t sure it can extend to cover our sins.\nEven when we want to keep it just for ourselves like Jonah.\nEven when we cannot imagine it being powerful enough to cover the wickedness of the world.\n\nChrist died for the world and ascended into heaven, leaving His disciples with a command to preach His gospel to all people. \n\nToday’s passage is deeply significant to us as believers. It is the moment in church history—in world history—when God makes plain to both Jews and Gentiles that we “should not call any person common or unclean” (Acts 10:28) as “God shows no partiality” among those who fear Him (Acts 10:34).\n\nThis is the moment that allows us to trace our fingers across the pages of our Bibles to see God’s gospel plan throughout, beginning with the Abrahamic Covenant in Genesis, where God “brought [Abram] outside and said, ‘Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them… So shall your offspring be’” (Genesis 15:5). \n\nAs our fingers follow the hand of God across centuries and generations, tabernacles and temples, kings and kingdoms, we stop here at this moment in Acts chapter 10—where the children of Abraham grow exponentially to “sand and stars” status—when God extends His family of sons and daughters to every kindred, tribe, and nation. \n\nHis long-ago promise of “I will be your God and you will be My people” (Exodus 6:7), which was once kept for the Jewish nation only, is now made available to all, the entire world, making “no distinction.” Repentance is now for everyone. \n\nDo you see it, too? God’s covenant to Abraham is fulfilled in the new covenant by Christ’s blood, right here in black and white, in the pages of His Word (Luke 22:20).\n\nOf course, God operates in significance, and this moment is no exception. From Acts chapter 1 until chapter 10—from Christ’s Great Commission to Peter’s vision—there were exactly three categories of people: Jews (God’s holy nation), Gentiles (anyone who wasn’t a Jew), and converted Gentiles (non-Jews who believed in the gospel of Jesus).\n\nHis invitation of life to the rest of the world was significantly personal. He did not send a Jew to tell the Gentiles they’d been grafted into God’s plan (Romans 11:11-31); He sent one of His own angels to appear to the newly converted Cornelius, a Gentile. Only then—a day later—did He send an angel to appear to Peter with the official word that from that point on, “God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him” (Acts 10:34).\n\nIt was a meeting arranged by God. He gave Peter the message to share and Cornelius ears to hear it. He made sure both of His sons knew they were both equally His, that there was no longer any distinction or need for categories. No matter Jew or Gentile, we who believe are now all sons and daughters of Abraham.\n\nPerhaps you haven’t looked at it this way before. Perhaps you’ve forgotten that you, too, “were once far off” (Ephesians 2:13). But now because of Jesus, “God has granted repentance that leads to life” for all who believe (Acts 11:18).\n\nHe has granted us repentance. It is a gift, an invitation to bow before Him and not be called common. An invitation to repent and to be forgiven. To be called sons and daughters of Abraham—sons and daughters of God Himself. Thanks be to God, indeed.\n\n“The Lord has displayed his holy arm in the sight of all the nations;\nall the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.” -Isaiah 52:10\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Acts 11:1-30, 1 Peter 4:16-19, Romans 15:25-28\n\nI slinked into my church’s Saturday night service and quietly sat in a row near the back. It had been a hard week, and I wanted to be alone. With a quick glance, I saw a few people I knew scattered about the room. It would have been good for me to stick around and chat with them, but instead I left after the closing prayer and sat in my car. Alone. \n\nThis is often my default when things get hard: be by myself, pray, journal, figure it out. It might be your default, too, and that would be understandable since we’re both living in a culture that promotes individualism and a DIY attitude toward all things. \n\nI don’t know the origin of this isolating cultural perspective, but I know it wasn’t learned from the book of Acts. In this chronicle of the early Church, we’ve read story after story of unity and togetherness. Scripture tells us “all the believers were together and held all things in common,” that they “were of one heart and mind” (Acts 2:44; 4:32).\n\nActs 11 carries on this unity theme, first with Peter defending the Gentiles. To say a Gentile could also be saved and receive the Holy Spirit was a big deal at the time. Until then, only Jews were considered candidates for Christianity; so letting Gentiles into the club was sort of like letting freshmen on the varsity team without a try-out. You just don’t do that. But Jesus did. \n\nAfter listening to Peter’s defense, the skeptics responded, saying, “So God has granted repentance resulting in life even to the Gentiles!” (Acts 11:18). Here we see the Church embracing the outsider in the name of Christ. In Jesus, salvation was—and is—offered to all, regardless of our labels.\n\nNext, we hear about the revival at Antioch. The number of conversions was so great that Barnabas went searching for his buddy Paul for help. At Antioch, they labored together for an entire year. Barnabas could have manned the Antioch church by himself, but he pulled in a friend to be with him on the journey. The disciples knew that ministry together was better than ministry alone. \n\nFinally, we get to the part that is my personal favorite, where believers are united not only in deed, but also in name as the term “Christian” is introduced (Acts 11:26). Before any other title we may hold—Jew, Gentile, mother, daughter, sister, friend, co-worker—is this one: Christian. It sets us apart as believers in the death and resurrection of Christ. Even stronger than a bloodline, is the Christ-line we all share. It is what makes the Church body a family. \n\nI thought of this while I was sitting in my car, in the church parking lot, alone. A building full of family sat in front of me, yet I was operating like the Lone Ranger. I had forgotten that the purpose of the Church is to do what Barnabas did at Antioch: “He encouraged all of them to remain true to the Lord with a firm resolve of the heart” (Acts 11:23). I had forgotten that salvation was for all weary sinners and I was welcome here, even on my worst days.\n\nSo I did what was not in my nature to do—I reached out to the Body, in the form of a group text. Thirty minutes later, I was sitting with friends, eating chips and guacamole. I shared a little and laughed a lot, and I was reminded that we were never meant to do this alone, that believers are united by an unbreakable thread in Christ. Before we are anything else we are Christians, and that makes us more than friends. That makes us family. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Acts 12:1-25, Mark 10:35-40, Isaiah 42:8\n\nPeter’s position seemed dire. He was in prison and scheduled for execution the following day (Acts 12:6). But I love the response of the Church here; they didn’t start a letter-writing campaign, or stage a protest—they gathered together to pray. And after they gathered together, instead of just angrily shouting about what to do next, they actually prayed.\n\nThis was their solution to an impossible situation. God was teaching His people what it means to be the Church. He was teaching them—and us—how to solve impossible problems. The answer is simply this: pray. It’s such a simple answer that they found it hard to believe it would actually work. They were surprised when Peter showed up at the door with the shackles off his hands (Acts 12:6-16).\n\nGod is so abundantly good, sometimes we don’t even see it. When He moves in a direct response to prayer we are inclined to miss it; we’d never dare to dream that His goodness extends far enough to answer our requests. In fact, sometimes we forget to pray at all!\n\nWhat if God uses pain to draw us to Him? It’s possible that dangers and struggles come to drive the Church to prayer—not because He needs us to pray, and not because He needs us to give glory to Him, but because He’s turning our gaze back toward Him. Surely, God’s glory and purposes aren’t subject to what we do or don’t do. In his book The Problem of Pain, C.S. Lewis put it this way: “For you will certainly carry out God’s purpose, however you act, but it makes a difference to you whether you serve like Judas or like John.”\n\nGod uses trials to bring us to prayer—to change us. He calls us to do His work, and sometimes that work feels impossible. Unthinkable things happen to us, marriages fail, parents get sick, our sweet new babies die—our hearts are broken. But we are not called to despair, or even to fear (Isaiah 41:10), because it’s in the places of deep darkness that God does His greatest work.\n\nLet us join with the saints of the early Church and use every hardship as an occasion to pray. We, too, can believe in God’s abundant goodness, and see how the gospel can flourish and multiply (Acts 12:24), even in times of persecution. \n\nAre you hurting today? Are you mourning the loss of the life you imagined? Does it seem like there is no solution, no hope? You are not alone. Receive that: you are not alone. Let your sadness, hurt, and despair prompt you to pray. \n\nGod is at work, even when we struggle to believe. \n\n",

Paul and Barnabas knew what was at stake and that at any moment their lives could be taken from them. But God had given them a task: to preach the good news of Jesus Christ to the nations. \n\nWhat an emotional roller coaster they must have experienced those few weeks in Pisidian Antioch. One week they proclaimed the truth that Jesus is the promised Messiah, and the people were receptive to their message. So much so, they invited Paul and Barnabas to speak again. I envision Paul and Barnabas as they headed away from the crowd, jumping for joy and praising God for the incredible response from that day. \n\nThe next week, the whole city turned out to hear the word of the Lord (Acts 13:44). Can you imagine? It must have been so encouraging for Paul and Barnabas to realize the part they were playing in spreading the message of Christ. \n\nBut then it happened. The Jews became filled with jealousy (Acts 13:45). They began to oppose Paul and Barnabas and their message. \n\nThis wasn’t the first time Paul and Barnabas had faced opposition to the gospel message (Acts 9:29). Had they given up at the first sign of trouble, they would have missed out on participating in the incredible work God was doing in spreading the good news.\n\nPaul and Barnabas were able to withstand the emotional highs and lows they faced throughout their ministry because they were resolved in their task, and they knew God was with them. They were confident God had called them to preach the message of Christ to the Gentiles. Regardless of what happened, they would do their very best to remain faithful. \n\nGod has given all of us tasks as well. He has placed them on each of our hearts and calls us to complete them. Maybe it’s a short-term task, changing daily. Or maybe it’s long-term, spanning the days and weeks and months ahead. \n\nWhatever our unique calling, God doesn’t expect our perfection, but He does desire our faithfulness. As God used Paul and Barnabas to proclaim the truth of Scripture to the people in Pisidian Antioch, He has called each of us to be part of His saving work on this earth. \n\nEven so, the outcome is not up to us. Paul and Barnabas were faithful. They may have felt like they had failed when the Jews rejected their message. But in His sovereignty, God used what seemed like failure to bring many Gentiles to Himself. \n\nFriends, let us keep pressing on. Let us aim to be faithful to God’s calling, and learn to let go of our own expectations for perfection. We can rest easy in this truth: we are ultimately not responsible for the outcome of our efforts. That lies in the hands of our incredibly powerful and overwhelmingly sovereign God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessie Minassian\n\nText: Acts 14:1-28, 2 Timothy 3:10-12, Colossians 4:2-4\n\nI have a friend who understands the illusion of fame well. \n\nOne summer, he was on stage in front of thousands of teens. As he walked behind a group of girls before a performance, he overheard them talking about how much they loved him. In a bold move, he approached the girls and entered into a conversation with them. Realizing they didn’t recognize him, he even offered to introduce them to that “guy on stage.” They giggled and talked excitedly, never knowing they had just been talking to the “star” himself. \n\nIt’s part of human nature to look up to those we admire. Obviously, that’s not all bad, but we can easily inflate and blow that admiration out of proportion. Paul and Barnabas learned this lesson nearly two thousand years ago.\n\nThey were empowered by the Holy Spirit; their words were eloquent and cut to the heart. Scripture tells us that when Paul and Barnabas preached, they “spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed” (Acts 14:1). They were certainly well-known, and in today’s culture we might even say they’d grown “famous.” And like most prominent people, they evoked two common—though extreme and unhealthy—responses: they were either loved or hated.\n\nWe see the first example of this in Iconium. The Jews were piping mad at the apostles’ powerful message. In response, they made personal attacks, threatened physical violence, and stirred up as much trouble as they possibly could (Acts 14:2). \n\nBut the people of Lystra had a different destructive response to Paul and Barnabas: they went absolutely gaga for them! The people were so taken with the message they preached that they began to idolize them. I know—garlands and animal sacrifice sound a bit extreme (Acts 14:18), but don’t let their pagan cultural response blind you to the modern implications. \n\nThink about the famous teachers of our time. More often than not, they teach—verbally or through written word—in ways that move us deeply and stir our hearts toward God. We are drawn to gifted teachers and come to admire, respect, and learn from them. But because of our sin nature, we’re also tempted to idolize them.\n\nAs for Paul and Barnabas, they weren’t having it. The apostles refused to receive the people’s misplaced accolades. \n\n“Men! Why are you doing these things? We are men also, with the same nature as you, and we are proclaiming good news to you, that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and everything in them.” -Acts 14:15\n\nWe will always be tempted to worship gifted people with powerful messages. So we must guard our hearts against worshiping the messenger instead of the God to whom we all belong. At the end of the day, the gospel will flourish because of Him, just as it thrived in those early days of the Church.\n\nThat’s what I love most about the close of Acts 14. Despite the misguided responses of Jews and Gentiles alike, the good news was preached, and souls were added to the Kingdom. God can and will use the power of earthly fame for His purposes, but He alone is worthy of our praise and adoration.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Is Christ Enough?",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lisa Harper\n\nText: Acts 15:1-35, Romans 2:17-24, Galatians 5:1\n\nThose first Jewish individuals who converted to Christianity were initially a bunch of scrupulous rule-followers. It’s no wonder they were having a hard time with the fraternity of Gentile converts, who’d seemingly sailed in from a laissez-faire, lawless background without “earning” the grace of God they were now reveling in. \n\nAnd so, the Jewish Christians decided to erect a hierarchical ladder with a few more steps leading to redemption (Acts 15:1-6). They adapted the “Faith in Jesus + Nothing = Salvation” message that Peter, Stephen, and Paul had preached, into a “Faith in Jesus + A More Restrictive Menu and Circumcision = Salvation” lecture. I imagine they secretly surmised it was a harmless enough edit.\n\nI mean, we aren’t expecting non-Jews to adhere to all 613 Torah rules or anything—just the biggies. All they have to do is order their steaks medium-well and agree to get their private parts tweaked a bit. That’s just a teensy outpatient surgery. Heck, we’ll even pay for the ice packs!       \n\nThis prejudiced-based friction between Jews and Greeks—officially titled “The Jerusalem Debate”—endangered the fellowship of the early Church. It caused such a rift in Antioch that Paul and Barnabas left, traveling back to Jerusalem to sort the matter out with the rest of the elders and apostles. Imagine the murmurs of differing opinions rippling through the multi-ethnic congregation of our mother Church when Peter stood up to address them:\n\n“Brothers, you know that in the early days God chose me from among you to preach the Good News to the nations. They heard the Good News from me, and they believed. God, who knows the thoughts of everyone, accepted them. He showed this to us by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us. To God, those people are not different from us. When they believed, he made their hearts pure. So now why are you testing God by putting a heavy load around the necks of the non-Jewish believers? It is a load that neither we nor our ancestors were able to carry. But we believe that we and they too will be saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus.” -Acts 15:7-11 (NCV)\n\nThe first point Peter argues is that the gospel they’d been preaching (Faith in Jesus + Nothing = Salvation) had already resulted in an international harvest of salvation. Obviously, the Holy Spirit was able to soften sinners’ hearts unto repentance without first whacking them over the head with a 50-pound rulebook. The testimony of Jesus Christ crucified and resurrected was perfectly sufficient to compel the lost to find their living hope in Him. \n\nI bet most of the men listening to Peter argue his case were now dumbfounded, slack-jawed with the realization that he’d just nailed them to the wall with his observation: the weight of the law almost broke your back, so why in the world are you so determined to strap it on someone else’s shoulders?     \n\nHere’s the deal about the judgment God declared as a result of humanity’s sin against Him (Romans 3:23): WE CAN NEVER BEHAVE WELL ENOUGH TO SATISFY IT. We can’t get good enough. No matter how many biblical rules we’re able to keep, it’s impossible for humans to attain perfection, and perfection is the only remedy for God’s wrath. This is why He sent His only begotten Son into the world, wrapped in a suit of skin: to live a perfect sinless life and shed His perfect blood during a sacrificial death, making perfect atonement for our sin. \n\nJesus is the only One who could justify us and reconcile us into a right relationship with our heavenly Father. If we could close the gap with God ourselves, Jesus could’ve just kept chilling out in Glory and skipped the whole sordid “Redeeming Mankind” mission.    \n\nThe Mosaic Law these well-intentioned Jewish Christians were so eager to push onto the Gentiles never had the power to save anyone. That wasn’t God’s intention when He gave it to Moses in the first place. God didn’t proclaim those commandments on that ancient pinnacle so that by them we could be saved. He gave them so we’d realize we can’t save ourselves! \n\nThe Old Testament moral and ceremonial stipulations underscore our absolute inability to achieve perfection. They were always, always, always meant to lead us to Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nText: Acts 15:36-41, Acts 16:1-15, John 15:26, 1 Corinthians 9:19-21\n\nIf you’ve been a Christian for any length of time, you’ve probably heard countless stories of rifts, splits, and politics in the Church. Maybe you or someone close to you has been really hurt by the way the imperfect people of the Church handled certain situations. It’s devastating when God’s people let their flaws get in the way of ministry, doing more harm than good.\n\nHowever, the Church is sometimes so afraid of discord that it swings too far the other way. Trying to maintain the unity Christians are called to (1 Peter 3:8), we can unintentionally create cultures that stifle any questioning or difference of opinion. The push for unity can be taken so far that it seems sinful to disagree at all. There must be a better solution to preventing the type of pain that church conflict is known to cause.\n\nThe struggle of Christians to balance unity with uniqueness is nothing new. In Acts, we read about the ministry of Paul and Barnabas, two exceptional men who gave their lives to preaching the gospel. But even these god-fearing men had a sharp disagreement. Barnabas wanted to bring Mark with them on their journey, but Paul didn’t think it would be wise, given that Mark had ditched them on a past journey. \n\nThere doesn’t seem to be a moral issue here, just a difference of opinion or perhaps a difference in what these men felt God was calling them to do. Barnabas was thinking about his cousin, and Paul was thinking about the dangers ahead. Even though the men decided to part ways, this story doesn’t paint either man as a villain. \n\nIt is so rare for us to view a disagreement like this without assigning blame to one party or the other. Surely someone is in the wrong! That was my reaction when I first read this story of Paul and Barnabas. But the more I dug, the more I found that most scholars don’t see a moral issue in the way these two godly men disagreed and parted.\n\nWhile it might not have been ideal for Paul and Barnabas to be on different pages, God used their parting of ways to reach more people and spread the gospel. In the end, their disagreement does not lead to a damaged relationship, nor do they appear to hold any ill will toward one another. In fact, Paul goes on to later speak very respectfully of Mark, calling him a fellow worker who had brought him comfort (Colossians 4:10-11). \n\nSometimes there is unavoidable pain from conflict because one or both parties are in the wrong, acting out of sin. Those situations are distinctly different in nature from the disagreement we here see between Paul and Barnabas. \n\nTheir conflict affirms that we can disagree and even be angry without sinning (Ephesians 4:26), if we do it with a gentle and humble spirit. We can part ways when needed without hurting others, if we understand that there does not always have to be a villain. Conflict can feel yucky, but in non-moral issues such as this, God can use it for His good purposes.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nText: Acts 16:16-40, 2 Corinthians 10:3-4, 1 Peter 2:19-21\n\nLocked in prison and bound in chains, Paul and Silas make strange poster boys for freedom. When we conjure up images of freedom, we are more likely to picture an eagle in flight or a child running uninhibited through a field, than to picture two fellas in a shared prison cell. But make no mistake, even in prison, Paul and Silas were free. Their story reminds us that when God’s people live as though they’re free, the shock waves of radical faith radiate out into the world.\n\nIf you’re someone who likes to underline (or circle, doodle beside, or watercolor), grab your Bible and pen or paintbrush, and get to work highlighting verse 25: \n\n“About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.” -Acts 16:25\n\nPaul and Silas had been arrested for disturbing the peace, and were then dragged into the marketplace where they were stripped and beaten with rods. Their response? They had church.\n\nThere simply wasn’t a dungeon dark enough to snuff out their status as the “light of the world” (Matthew 5:14). No earthly shackles could compare to the chains of sin Christ died to free them from. The key had been turned on the cages of death and condemnation, and no prison sentence could strip them of that freedom. Though imprisoned, they chose to live out the message of that favorite children’s song, “Hide it under a bushel? No! I’m gonna let it shine.” The prisoners in chains all around them couldn’t help but listen in. \n\nI can’t get enough of the jailer’s conversion from this passage. This man who held the keys to an earthly prison exchanged them for the keys to the Kingdom of heaven (Matthew 16:19). What a beautiful picture of the gospel!\n\nAs the earth shook beneath him and the prison doors flew open, perhaps he saw his own chains for the first time. When God’s people live freely, those in bondage all around us are moved to look at their own chains and repeat the jailer’s question:\n\n\u2022 “What must I do to be saved?” (Acts 16:30)\n\u2022 Don’t miss this! If we are in Christ, we are free indeed (John 8:36).  \n\u2022 Free from the law of sin and death (Romans 8:2).\n\u2022 Free from the enslaving weight of sin (Galatians 5:1).\n\u2022 Free from the bondage of corruption (Romans 8:21).\n\u2022 Free from eternal condemnation (Romans 8:1).   \n\nJesus is the great abolitionist. From the cross, He shook the foundations of our prison cells and flung open the doors to our hearts, freeing the bound and enslaved so that we might freely live. \n\n“For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.” -Galatians 5:1\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellie Holcomb\n\nText: Acts 17:1-34, Zechariah 12:10, Romans 3:21-26\n\nI’ve read Acts many times before, but something changed for me as I was preparing to write this. The She Reads Team suggested that, in addition to reading through the whole book of Acts, we might want to listen through the whole book as well. (There are tons of free ways to do this online. Try it!) I’d never thought to do it before, but it was remarkable. \n\nAs I simply listened to the story Paul was so adamant in telling—of his conversion, Jesus’ resurrection from the dead, and the crazy beautiful way God brought Jews and Gentiles together with the gospel of good news—I was transported from my own story and swept up into God’s. And like Paul, it made me want to share the gospel.\n\nIn Acts 17, we see that Paul continues to look for any opportunity to share the gospel of the resurrected Jesus. But while in Athens, he is greatly troubled to find that the city is full of idols.  \n\n“…as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.” -Acts 17:23\n\nI had to press pause on my phone. The phrase, “I looked carefully at your objects of worship” echoed in my heart. \n\nI don’t have images in silver or gold placed throughout my house that I treat as idols, but I was so convicted as Paul spoke about worshiping an unknown god. I thought about how many things I’ve tried to replace the love of God with in my life, and I began to ask the Lord if there were currently any unknown gods I’ve been worshiping. \n\nThat’s where it began… a “re-ordering of the loves” in my heart, as Augustine called it. As of late, I’ve been searching for my worth in the way that I perform as a mom, as a daughter, and as a friend. I measure how much I matter by what other people think about me or by how they respond to me. And once again, I am so deeply convicted of ascribing more worth to what others think of me than to what God thinks of me—of what He has done for me. \n\nI feel it deep in my bones, the discontent that comes when I look to anything other than Jesus for my identity and happiness. Tim Keller says it like this: “Disordered love always leads to misery and breakdown. The only way to reorder our loves is to love God supremely.” Loving Him first is the only way (John 14:6).\n\nPaul goes on to proclaim to the Athenians the beautiful truth about our God:\n\nHe “made the world and everything in it” (v. 24).\nHe “gives everyone life and breath and all things” (v. 25).\n“He is not far from each one of us,” for it’s in Him that we live (v. 27-28).\nHe counts us as His children (v. 29).\n\nThis is the God Paul points us to. May we learn to love Him supremely and find sweet satisfaction in His grace.\n\nFather, forgive us for worshiping false, even unknown, gods. By Your grace, please reveal them to us. Help us to shift our gaze from all the lesser loves to You, the One true lover of our souls. By your mercy, re-order our hearts as You see fit, and teach us to worship You alone. Amen.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Missy Fuller\n\nText: Acts 18:1-28, James 4:13-15, Isaiah 51:1-2\n\n“There’s nothing to be afraid of.”\nThey were lying. I had plenty to be afraid of.\n\nI had just climbed up a steep lakeside embankment with nothing more than a swimsuit, Chaco sandals, and the intent of jumping off a 50-foot cliff into the water. My brother and his best friend were doing all they could to convince me everything would be fine, that there was nothing to fear. \n\nWhat if I slip as I’m jumping and hit my head?\nWhat if I hit the water at a bad angle?\nWhat if this water isn’t as deep as we think it is?\nWhat if I land on a floating tree branch?\n\nFear. It’s a big deal. It can keep us from doing things we’d really like to do. It can also keep us from doing exactly what God has asked of us. It can even cause us to live our lives in ways that leave us no room for faith; we become so seemingly independent that we begin to believe we don’t need God or anyone else. \n\nI don’t know if you’re like me and have every “Do not fear” in the entire Bible circled, underlined, and highlighted. It makes sense to see it in the Old Testament, when the heroes of Israel are heading into battle. But Paul? Is this the same Paul who had already faced oppression, persecution, and imprisonment for the gospel? That Paul was afraid? \n\nThen the Lord said to Paul in a night vision, “Don’t be afraid, but keep on speaking and don’t be silent. For I am with you, and no one will lay a hand on you to hurt you, because I have many people in this city.” -Acts 18:9-10\n\nDo not be afraid. The Greek phrase used in verse 9 means “you must not be afraid any longer.” Literally, stop being afraid!\n\nThis is confirmation that yes, Paul was, in fact, already afraid. The text doesn’t give us much more context for Paul’s fear. Was his fear the “thorn in his flesh” that would always plague him (2 Corinthians 12)? Was this a one-time situation where he was especially afraid? The Jews had opposed him and abused him before, but that can’t be something one gets used to. \n\nRegardless of the details, we can be sure of one thing: Paul was afraid and God commanded him to not be afraid any longer. \n\nLike Paul, I’ve faced some crippling fears (yes, even more terrifying than that time I jumped off a cliff). God has called me to things and I’ve stood frozen, still paralyzed by a fear of failure or defeat. Instead of embracing the strength and victory He promises (1 Corinthians 15:57), I’ve let fear dictate what I believe and what I do. \n\nEven in the most intimidating situations, God is faithful. He gave Paul the assurance that He would protect him. Just look at how perfectly God provided for Paul: \n\n\u2022 He brought him fellowship and friendship with Aquila and Priscilla (Acts 18:18).\n\u2022 He provided for his physical needs, allowing him to continue working as a tentmaker (v. 3).\n\u2022 He allowed him to spread the gospel in Corinth for another year and a half (v. 11).\n\nOur God provides for us too. Despite the moments we feel crippled with fear, He knows exactly where we are and what we’re feeling. We can trust that God is bigger than all our fears. \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Paul’s Third Missionary Journey",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nText: Acts 19:1-41, Luke 3:16, Ephesians 6:12\n\nI’ve been spending a lot of time in New York City lately, and I love it. People there are beautiful and stylish, moving at a pace that seems faster than humanly possible. You get the feeling that everyone is on an important mission, chasing their dream and making it happen. The energy is intoxicating. \n\nBut there’s also a sense that it’s all hanging in a very tight balance. Life in the commercial center of the world is expensive, fast, and hard. The margins are slim between living and not being able to make rent. That energy is fraught with anxiety, loneliness, and an underlying fear that it all could slip away.\n\nThis is the world Paul stepped into when he arrived in Ephesus. \n\nLocated in the far western corner of modern-day Turkey, Ephesus was the epicenter of the Mediterranean. The city’s theater had capacity for 25,000 people and the temple of the goddess Artemis towered over the city, nearly four times larger than the Parthenon in Athens. This was a place to see and be seen. A place to live your dreams. And Paul wasn’t just passing through; he moved in. \n\nUnlike his peers in the city, Paul had no economic agenda. Genuine and unassuming, he was a person people wanted to be around because he wasn’t there to leverage every relationship into a better job or status. He just wanted the Ephesians to know the Truth. It was only a matter of time before someone realized they were staring at a serious economic opportunity. \n\nSceva’s sons name-dropped with the best of them, hoping to ride Paul’s and Jesus’ momentum to fame and fortune. They were enamored with the miracles, but not with the One who made them possible. \n\nIn the oddest way, I love the evil spirits’ response to their half-hearted healing (Acts 19:14-15). Even demons believe in God and shudder (James 2:19), but speaking His name is powerless unless you truly know Him. \n\nAfter this violent encounter, a wellspring of believers realized their own mistake with the prosperity gospel. Convicted and impassioned to make a change, they made a public display of their repentance, setting aflame 50 thousand drachmas—the equivalent of 136 years’ worth of work. A huge portion of Ephesus’ GDP.\n\nClearly, that shift in values didn’t sit well with everyone in the city. As more Ephesians fell in love with Jesus, the silversmith, Demetrius feared for his livelihood, the future of the temple, and the future of his city. Perhaps he was driven by more than money, or maybe he wasn’t. Regardless, Demetrius chose to riot rather than repent.\n\nHaven’t we all?\nHas God ever messed with your economy? \n\nIt isn’t easy to let go of our jobs, our money, or our city. Those things feel like life. But God loves us too much to let money be our god, to let fame lure us away from Truth, or let us live a life of name-dropping, rather than heart-knowing. \n\nIs it possible that Jesus was calling Demetrius to abandon his meaningless silver souvenirs, into a more creative life? Did fear kidnap his chance to be the artist God created him to be?\n\nOne thing is certain. Jesus promises us a full, abundant life—greater than anything we can ask or imagine (Ephesians 3:20-21). His whisper is honest and true. There’s more, beloved. There’s more.\n\nIt waits for you on the other side of the fire.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Acts 20:1-38, 1 Corinthians 16:1-4, Philippians 1:20-21\n\nThe price we pay for the sun-drenched joys of summer camp are the sad farewells. I was seventeen and my legs were completely covered by bug bites, from my athletic sandals to my cuffed jean shorts. Bending over to scratch an ankle while Emily and I propped up the last of the mattresses in our cabin, I allowed myself a moment to peek into my sadness. Back at home, I was “Becky,” but at camp, I’d managed to introduce myself as “Rebecca,” and after a summer of feeling so grown up, I was sad to leave.\n\nEmily, sunburnt and still wearing a camp t-shirt, hugged me and said, “See you in heaven!” And she left. Just like that. I remember sitting alone in the fading light of our empty cabin, smelling the warm cedar and thinking, “See you in heaven?! Can she even say that to me?” It felt so final, and yet so hopeful. No one has said those words to me since, and I don’t think I’ll ever see Emily again, so she was probably right.\n\nHer words stuck with me, however, and when I read Paul’s lingering goodbyes to the Ephesians, I’m reminded of how hard it is for us to say our final farewells. Small things receive huge significance when they are the last things. Even the dust motes floating in the air, illuminated by shafts of sunlight, seem important in our last moments with those we love. \n\nSet in the context of eternity, all these things—all these moments—are the last things. My summer camp goodbyes are mostly forgotten, but that one reminded me that this world is passing away (1 Corinthians 7:31). Paul’s last address to the Ephesians invited them to see the world in the light of eternity, to make much of little things, because our goodbyes in this world are many and often.\n\nKnowing that none of them would ever see his face again, Paul slowed everything down to cry and savor their time together. Some of Paul’s last words to them were simple: \n\n“But I count my life of no value to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of God’s grace.” -Acts 20:24\n\nIn his final moments with dear friends, Paul wanted to speak to them about only the things that truly matter. Whether we die at the ripe old age of 110 or at breakfast tomorrow morning, these moments on earth are so dearly short compared to eternity. These sunlit days are brief and full of petite goodbyes. Paul uses these moments to commit his beloved friends “to God and to the message of His grace” (Acts 20:32).\n\nIn the midst of the sadness of all our goodbyes, the small and the huge farewells, God’s presence continues to go with both parties. When we are joined together in Christ, He promises that we will share an inheritance together in heaven (Romans 8:17). Indeed, we have His word that, “In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).\n\n",

You know how they end, but something in you hopes beyond hope that somehow the ending will be different this time. The guy and the girl will get together. The epic battle scene will end in the good guy’s favor. But it never happens, does it? Because the ending has already been written.\n\nThis is how I feel when I enter the final chapters of Acts. I know Paul’s imprisonment is coming, but I want it to end differently this time. I want Paul to be free to bring the gospel everywhere and to everyone. When I read Acts 21, I don’t want that fateful day in the temple to come—the day that changed Paul’s course forever. For the remainder of the book, our friend is either in prison, en route to prison, or under house arrest. This is the last we see of Paul as a free man. \n\nWho hasn’t experienced a change of course? There we are, trucking along, doing fine and—BOOM—something happens that changes our direction. Something messes with the end of the story we’d planned for ourselves—an unexpected, and often unwanted, shift. \n\nWhen this happens to me, I look at God with shrugged shoulders. “What are You doing?” I ask. “Why is this happening? What now?” \n\nI’m not often given specific answers to these questions, but these shifts always remind me that God is the author of my story, not me. When I surrendered my life to Christ, I gave up ownership of myself (Galatians 2:19-20). I no longer call the shots, and a change of course is a good, though hard, reminder of this critical part of the Christian life.\n\nWhile we can’t predict how or when these shifts in our stories will occur, we can expect them. Paul did. When his friends warn him about his potential fate in Jerusalem, he asks, \n\n“What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”Acts 21:13\n\nKnowing full well the danger he faced, Paul continued the ministry he was called to. He didn’t allow the unknown to paralyze him. He had been transformed on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:1-25), filled with the Spirit, and now he lived as though his life were not his own.\n\nAs a Christ follower, I want to do just that: follow Christ. I want to live life with open hands, being prepared and ready for what God has in store, rather than resistant to it. Under God’s care, we may not always know what’s coming next, but we can trust Him, come what may.\n\nSome of the stories in our lives will have sad endings we’d like to change. But the Story of our lives? We know how it ends. We’ve been promised the best ending imaginable. Our good and faithful God will prevail, and we will get spend eternity with Him. \n\nIn the meantime, let’s trust God with the other stories, the changes of course—no matter how trying, no matter how unexpected. Knowing that He is God and He is good, let us say with confidence, “The Lord’s will be done!” (Acts 21:14).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Wilbert\n\nText:  Acts 21:37-40, Acts 22:1-30, Acts 23:1-11, 1 Peter 3:21-22, Hebrews 10:19-22\n\nIn the last few verses of Acts 21, we find Paul has been arrested yet again and taken by Roman soldiers to the barracks. There he makes his defense, culminating in the reality that he is a Roman citizen and, as such, cannot be treated like he is being treated (Acts 22:23-29). When the Romans realize they have made a serious political mistake, they hand him over to the Jews, where Paul pulls the same defense—that he is one of them, a Pharisee and a son of Pharisees (Acts 23:6). That’s some impressive genealogical gymnastics, and it’s a lesson for us all. \n\nWho are we? \n\nMy pastor once said that every time the Enemy comes to remind him of his sin, he reminds the Enemy he’s right. \n\nHe is a liar.\nHe is guilty of the lust of the flesh.\nHe is like a murderer in his heart.\nHe is a thief, a scoundrel, and an unworthy son of God.\n\nBut no matter what we are or what we’ve done, the truest thing about us is who we are in Jesus. As my pastor so faithfully reminds me, Christ has taken our sin and borne it on our behalf. So though we are guilty of countless things, we are not identified by them. \n\nThe Enemy is a liar, but his best tactic is to take the truth and twist it just enough—leave out enough of the whole truth—that I am caught in his lair. I forget who I am, or I exaggerate who I am, or I minimize it. And, what’s more, I forget who God is. \n\nIn this passage, Paul is caught in the lair of two enemies—the Romans and the Jews—and his best defense is to say the whole truth to both. \n\nTo the Romans, he is a Roman citizen by birthright. He is endowed with all the rights and perks of his citizenship. And to the Jews, he is a Pharisee of Pharisees. He is a prince of Pharisees, student of the Torah, and righteous rabbi. Paul is not swinging from two extremes in this passage; he is telling the truth—the whole truth. \n\nSo often we get caught in the web of lies about who we are and who God is. In those moments, it’s easy to forget the cross, the blood of Christ, the resurrection, and the hope of eternity. It’s easy to forget who we are by our birth in Christ. \n\nIn those moments, remember Paul. Say to the Enemy who comes to kill, steal, and destroy (John 10:10), “I know who I am and who God is. I know my sin and my wrongdoing. And I know that all the righteousness of God has covered over me.” \n\nWe, like Paul, are on trial with “respect to the hope and resurrection of the dead” (Acts 23:6). And, friend, we will one day rise again with all the people of our eternal home country. Until then, this is the gospel antidote to the lies of our enemy: \n\n“Yes, but…” \n\n…we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ the Righteous One.\n\nHe Himself is the propitiation for our sins… -1 John 2:1-2\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText:  Acts 23:12-35, 2 Corinthians 4:8-12, Job 33:4\n\nPaul was on the road to his death, a journey to Rome he suspected would end in martyrdom. Yet, in spite of the uncertainty ahead, he was exuberantly alive in Christ. This paradox of death and life exists for us all. Trusting in God’s good providence is life, but trusting in our own strength means only death.\n\nThough faced with a fierce opposition that constantly threatened his life, Paul did not set his hope on his own strength, nor place his trust in earthly and human things. His sight was always set upon Christ and His kingdom. The Jews, however, were a remarkable contrast. They, too, were committed to a kingdom in this life-and-death struggle, but it was not the Kingdom of Christ. \n\nForty of these men swore an oath not to eat until they killed Paul (Acts 23:12). Translators render this phrase both as “oath” and “curse,” and it comes from the Greek word anathema. I’ve heard this word used in English for strong dislike (i.e., “After she stole my boyfriend at the party, she is anathema to me.”), but that’s such a sad watering-down of this big, meaty word. Anathema is a declaration, a curse, or vow that a thing is devoted to destroying (Numbers 21:2-3, Joshua 6:17). It is a thing accursed—something set aside because of moral worthlessness.\n\nIn fact, another place this word is used in the Bible is Peter’s third betrayal of Christ. Peter was using his strongest language to emphasize the distance between himself and Christ:\n\nThen he started to curse and to swear with an oath, “I don’t know this man you’re talking about!” -Mark 14:71\n\nIn His mighty grace, Christ forgave Peter. His forgiveness is so deep. But to plot evil is to seek death instead of life. The prophet Micah reminds us that to lie in bed at night and devise evil schemes is bad, but to wake up the next morning and vow to commit yourself to them is to make a covenant with evil (Micah 2:1). It’s like the difference between crimes committed in the heat of passion and a cold-blooded resolve to do evil. \n\nIn cold blood, these men took a vow devoting themselves to the destruction of Paul, believing it was for the good of society. This combination of spiritual blindness and self-reliance is deadly. They believed that if they didn’t act, justice would never be done. But trying to take justice into our own hands shows contempt for God’s providence. The plans of those forty Jews were foiled because they’d bound themselves to do evil, which is death itself.\n\nHow often do we believe that God depends on us to wrangle our version of justice in the world? Instead, we must depend on Him and His sovereignty. Let us bind ourselves to Christ and His Kingdom, not to death and anathema or by taking things into our own hands. God is sovereign, and His is the way of life.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Acts 24:1-27, Jeremiah 29:10-14, Hebrews 13:15\n\nOn my daughter’s dresser sits a white ceramic sheep that sat on my own dresser when I was about her age. The sheep is small—a couple inches tall—and sits on its bottom, straight-legged, like a person sitting on a floor. Its front legs are pointed up, two little sheep-feet wrapped over the top of a stack of small 1×3-inch cards, each displaying a Bible verse.\n\nI always loved that sheep. Even now, when I go in my daughter’s room, I can’t resist the nostalgic urge to slide the stack out of its arms and put a new verse on top, then slide it carefully back into place.\n\nThere is something strangely compelling about encountering a Bible verse in this happenstance sort of way—a momentary feeling of mystery that ignites when I come across a verse unexpectedly. I stare at it like a puzzle piece, wondering where and how its truth fits into my current circumstances. “What does it MEAN?” I wonder.\n\nPut me in a situation like Paul was in—standing trial before yet another ruler, facing yet another set of false accusations—and I’m sure to read into every detail. Conflict isn’t exactly my specialty, so I’d probably internalize it all, anxiously assessing how each and every factor affects my main character: me. Leaving the matter unresolved is my worst-case scenario. Uncertainty is my kryptonite.\n\nThis back-and-forth with Felix went on for two years (Acts 24:27). TWO YEARS. While I’m pretty sure the uncertainty alone would be enough to kill me, I don’t get the vibe that it kept Paul up at night. I’m not sure he even regarded uncertainty as uncertainty. In his monologue before Felix, Paul said, “I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets” (Acts 24:14). It follows, then, that Paul knew and believed this little gem:\n\n“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.” -Jeremiah 29:11\n\nHere’s the difference between Paul and me (as if there’s only one): I believe God has good plans for me, but I assume His plans fall within the boundary lines of my own. In other words, God’s good plans for me are His expert version of my first draft. Paul knew better.\n\nThat little verse, presented all alone on the sheep’s card, is true because God’s Word is true. But in the context of Jeremiah 29, it is even better. That verse and those around it are God’s message sent to His people in exile through the prophet Jeremiah. We don’t have to zoom out very far to see that this message of hope from God to His people was not the quick, tidy bow we often make it out to be:\n\n“For thus says the Lord: When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place. For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord… I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.” -Jeremiah 29:10-14\n\nSeventy years. That’s how long they’d be in exile—an exile that, according to verse 14, God sent them into. Were these the plans they were hoping for? Not likely. Were they a ridiculously good promise from their ever-faithful God? Absolutely. Their exile was not the end. \n\nPaul knew this, too. He knew Scripture is true—not in part, but in whole. He knew the gospel of Jesus is true—not in part, but in whole. Paul knew God is sovereign and good—not sometimes, but all the time. Not within the boundaries we give Him, but through all of history and time and space. Our hope does not die when our hands are chained or when life seems at a standstill. Our God is sure and faithful. \n\nPaul did not know how all the pieces would fit together, but he knew his exile was not the end. Because of Jesus, neither is ours. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nText:  Acts 25:1-27, Acts 26:1-32, Proverbs 2:6-8, Psalm 37:28\n\nAt just the right time of day, my home floods with sunlight. There are only two front-facing windows downstairs, but for a few moments the sun angles in just right and, from front to back, there’s a rush of light across the house. It’s my favorite time of day. \n\nThis morning, I am sitting at our dining room table trying to sort through my workday needs (this post being at the top of the list). And in that stream of light, all I can see are the particles of dust floating, the worn edges of chairs and tables in the living room, and the small cobweb growing in the corner of the window. The light, beautiful as it is, reveals the grime. \n\nI’ve been busy, see, trying to do what I think God has called me to these days. I’m caring for the needs of my home and trying to figure out what my purpose is in this new foreign place we’ve moved to. I’ve been so preoccupied with learning to be faithful in these things, that I haven’t even noticed the cobweb in the corner of the window. But the light reveals my lack.\n\nNone of us likes to have our sin brought out into the light and revealed to ourselves, let alone to others.\n\nNo one wants to have that Paul-on-the-Road-to-Damascus moment, where the light as bright as the sun shone around him, pinning him to the ground, and delving into the darkest parts and intentions of his heart (Acts 26:13-14). But God once called the light good (Genesis 1:4), and we have to believe this is one of the reasons why. The light reveals what the night has hidden and brings to sight what has been forgotten. \n\nPsalm 37:28 says, “the Lord loves justice,” and I am a little like that. But mostly I love justice when it’s given to others. I squirm when I myself come under the light—my faults revealed and my sins displayed. I hate justice then. I feel the same about the dust particles and cobwebs as I feel about my propensity to doubt, to fear, to sin with my words and deeds. \n\nIn the light I am embarrassed, ashamed, and fearful of being found out. But God loves the light. \n\nAs we see in this passage, He wants His children to turn away from darkness and step into the light. The thing that makes us feel most naked and exposed is one of the things our God loves most—not because of the pain and discomfort we feel in the midst of it, but because it reveals our greatest need: God Himself. \n\nWhat is the light exposing in your life today? What dust particles and cobwebs have been lurking in the living room of your heart? What besetting doubts and fears have taken up residence in your soul? \n\nGod is preparing for you a Damascus Road experience, whether here or in eternity, in which every one of your thoughts and sins will be exposed. But He is also like the father of the prodigal son in this and in every moment: picking up His robes and running, undignified, toward His child who has come to his senses and come home (Luke 15:11-32).\n\nDon’t run from the light today, friends. Go stand in it, be blinded by it, and see the manifold magnificent grace of the Father who shines it on you. \n\n",

In fact, I don’t think they even knew each other existed or had anything in common, except for the fact that they were characters played in the same production of 42nd Street by the same actress—me. \n\nThey were polar opposites. Gladys was a seasoned Broadway showgirl, singing her heart out while teaching the lead how to tap dance. Ragamuffin #3 was an unnamed beggar, wearied by the Great Depression. I’d love to know what was running through the director’s mind as she cast the roles. When she spread out all of the submitted headshots and stared into those hopeful faces, I wonder what made her point to mine and think, Gladys! and… Ragamuffin #3.\n\nBackstage, my dressing room had two separate racks. Gladys’ was all sequins and show, while Ragamuffin #3’s was bare and battered. During the show, I’d shuffle behind the curtains to apply or remove lipstick, change and adjust wigs, and look down to make sure I wasn’t wearing tap shoes with my beggar’s clothes. Any small change could poke holes in the audience’s perception of the story, so it was up to me to make sure Gladys and Ragamuffin #3 didn’t meet during the show. \n\nIsn’t it funny how even the smallest details can create or destroy our perception? \n\nIf I take a seat in the audience of my own life, I begin to cast myself and my circumstances in the leading role. When I get a new job and move to a new city, I’m bathing in sequins for days. But when I’m tossing and turning, worrying about my relationships, I’m costumed in tattered old rags. \n\nI wonder if those aboard the ship in Acts 27 felt like they were auditioning for forgotten, unnamed roles. The ship was seemingly built to wreck, the storm to destroy, the disease to kill, the crew to die. Any audience member would assume they’d been cast and chosen for the role of suffering. And yet, our circumstances don’t write our story; God does. \n\nThe ship crashes on the island of Malta and the turning point is seemingly nowhere in sight, when Paul breaks out of character, shedding the costume of suffering, and healing those around him. Now, the curtain could fall here and tell the wrong story, encouraging us to serve from our suffering and applaud the go-getter. \n\nBut what if that’s not what God has for us here? What if Jesus wants to meet us backstage and between the curtains, past the crowd and the circumstances? I don’t think God spreads our faces across a board, separating His children into categories of “suffering” and “celebrating.” Instead, He just claims us as “His,” over and over again. We are a chorus of His beloved sons and daughters. \n\nWhen we let His truth about our identity create our perception, the focus is no longer the role of suffering or serving, but the One who combined the two on the cross. We need Ragamuffin #3 just as much as we need Gladys; but just as they are cast to tell a story, so are we. \n\nMay we renew our faith in the Director, and assume our appointed roles in the truthful pages of His gospel. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText:  Acts 28:11-31, Isaiah 6:9-10, 2 Timothy 4:6-8\n\nI recently came across a picture from my dad’s final months. He is wearing his hospital gown, sitting in the chair in his hospital room, and my three small children are sitting next to him, perched in a row on the window sil. Dad is grinning at them, eyes bright, and the kids are all carefree smiles and laughter, no idea the end was so near.\n\nWe visited him as often as we could back then, in the hospital and at home, stealing every moment with him we could get. And he was always glad to see us, drinking up our presence even on his hardest days. \n\nIt never occurred to me that he didn’t have to welcome us in. I never considered that the vulnerability of those final days was not just thrust upon him, but something he chose to embrace. We saw each day as an opportunity to be with him, and despite having every reason to opt out, he chose to see it as the same.\n\nThis last chapter of Acts does not tell us about Paul’s death, but we know he was eventually martyred in Rome. And we know this is how he spent his final years:\n\n“He welcomed all who visited him, proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with full boldness and without hindrance.” -Acts 28:30\n\nIf it were me, I think I would need a minute. All those years of faithfully preaching the gospel, traveling from city to city, raising up young churches and mentoring new pastors, not to mention being falsely accused and imprisoned time and time again for speaking the truth—after all that, I would view house arrest as an overdue opportunity for a long, well-deserved nap. Not Paul. Paul didn’t need a minute.\n\nPaul knew what awaited him.\n\nCould he see his martyrdom coming? Possibly. But he could definitely see beyond it. Paul wasn’t living for this vapor of a life here on earth. He was living for something bigger. Paul was living for the gospel. And here’s how he did it: he lived for the eternal by making the most of the temporary.\n\nThe apostle didn’t while away his time on earth just to get to the next chapter. He did something radical—he believed the good news was true and he lived like it.\n\n“From dawn to dusk he expounded and witnessed about the kingdom of God.” -Acts 28:23\n\nThe book of Acts reminds us that, like Paul, we are part of the biggest picture—we, the Church, are part of God’s story. This is our story, and Paul is our brother. But the call of this book is not to be like Paul. The call of this book is to be like Christ.\n\nJesus, too, looked beyond the present while embracing it. Jesus, too, poured Himself out “as a drink offering” to His final day (2 Timothy 4:6). But He did so much more. \n\nThe Christ who was the hope of the Apostle Paul is also our hope, having taken upon Himself all of our sin—past, present, and future—and suffered separation from the Father so that we might be reconciled to God (2 Corinthians 5:21). Then, having endured the punishment of death that was due us, He was resurrected, making us alive in Him (1 Corinthians 15:20, 22). And now—right now—He sits at the right hand of the Father, actively advocating on our behalf (Romans 8:34).\n\nThis Christ is our hope. \n\nYou and I are vulnerable like Paul. We, too, will have last days. But we can live those and all our days fully, joyfully pouring out every last drop, knowing that our hope in Jesus will never, ever end. Thanks be to God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nIn any study of biblical people, it’s tempting to take the easy route and look at the humans in the story and say, “Yeah! Do what they did!” or, more frequently, “Don’t do what she did, oh no!” We long to take a moral from the stories of their lives. Resist this urge. Look instead, in every story, at what God is doing. Even in the stories where we don’t see His name mentioned, He is working and remembering His people. He is putting the gospel story on display in their individual stories—and in our own.\n\nAdam and Eve give us a glimpse of what pre-fall humanity looked like as untarnished image-bearers of God (Genesis 1:27). At the start, they are righteously naked—naked like babies. I imagine they are just delighted to be alive, living freely in healthy, functioning bodies alongside their Creator. But after the fall, Adam and Eve are tarnished image-bearers of God, and their nakedness bears shame instead of pure and innocent glory.\n\nTruly, Adam and Eve’s original state is hardly recognizable to us. Since the fall, we now see all things from the perspective of our own fallenness. Every nook and cranny of our world now hides a tinge of that original sin. So it’s tough to imagine righteous nakedness, but I am definitely on board for the new heaven and the new earth where shame and sin no longer smudge the image of God we bear.\n\nAdam and Eve, realizing their sin and shame, attempt to hide and cover up. First they use their own hands to craft garments from fig leaves; they are attempting a man-made, physical solution to a spiritual problem. This is insufficient.\n\nThen God clothes them in animal skins, but this requires the first shedding of blood—the loss of life and spirit of an animal—signifying that a God-created, spiritual solution is needed to solve the problem of sin and shame.\n\nWe need God to clothe us as He clothed Adam and Eve. Our spotless righteousness was lost in the fall. Now, we must be clothed with His robes of righteousness, which can only be granted by the shedding of blood—Jesus’s blood. When we are clothed in His righteousness, we can once again find freedom from shame and guilt.\n\nWe still try to find our own way to righteousness, to free ourselves from shame, either by declaring our sins to be virtues—or by ignoring them altogether. We try to deny that we are fallen at all and laud our shame as admirable (Romans 1:28–32). But these efforts are just more fig leaves.\n\nThe only solution is Christ. He does not return us to the past, to Eden, but raises us to a new and greater Eden, which cannot be lost. He does not merely restore us to pre-fallen righteous nakedness, but grants us the new and more glorious clothing of Christ’s righteousness. In Him alone we find the fullness of what it means to be made in the image of God: to be like Christ. And “we know that we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is” (1 John 3:2).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nMy husband and I swore we would never plant a church.\n\nWe didn’t have the personalities for it. We didn’t have the risk tolerance. We didn’t have the entrepreneurial skill set it demanded. And besides, we had seen other people start churches and knew how hard it was. We believed in church planting, but it was for “other people,” we said.\n\nAnd then, God called us to plant a church. \n\nFor months we resisted. We considered other options. We interviewed for other jobs. We asked God to confirm His calling while secretly hoping He would not. This was not the story we had chosen for ourselves. \n\nRadical obedience to God makes for great Sunday school lessons and bedtime stories, and Noah’s Ark is one of the most beloved. A man called by God, so late in his life, to do something remarkably ludicrous by the world’s standards: to build an ark on dry ground, large enough to hold animals of every kind. It is a fun story to tell, but the reality of radical obedience is a different matter. It is scary. It is uncomfortable. It is risky. And sometimes, it is embarrassing.\n\nWe can only imagine how Noah might have felt throughout the construction of the ark. What was the reaction of the surrounding community? Did they question his state of mind?\n\nAs often as we tell this story to our children, as often as we reenact the animals marching two by two, and as often as we remember the importance of trusting God’s character, we sometimes miss the utter foolishness of Noah’s faithfulness. In Noah’s story and many others’ throughout Scripture, it is impossible to obey and maintain one’s dignified reputation. They have to choose. As do we.\n\nThis is the less talked about side of following God. Yes, it is hard. Yes, we sacrifice. Yes, it is painful. But the part of faithfulness that sometimes catches us by surprise is the humiliation of it. The whispers. The stares. The questions about your motives. The doubts about your leadership. The absence of support. The silence. The skepticism about whether or not you really heard from God.\n\nWe cannot miss this part of Noah’s story—his willingness to look like a fool—because this is, very often, what we are saying yes to when we say yes to God. Thankfully, we have historical figures like Noah to remind us who God is and why we can trust Him. And more importantly, we also have Christ, who obediently became a fool, endured mockery, and suffered total humiliation because He knew the end of the story. This so-called foolishness is the narrow path we are called to, but because of spiritual ancestors like Noah, and because of Christ Himself, we know that no matter what God calls us to—whether we would have chosen it or not—we are never doing it alone. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nWhen the New Testament talks about the great patriarch Abraham, it’s his tremendous faith that is the highlight of his story. He was indeed exceptional, but Abraham wasn’t perfect. Throughout the course of his story, we see that while Abraham clearly believed God’s promise, he didn’t always trust God’s process. \n\n(A part of Abraham’s story is God changing his name, from Abram to Abraham. More on that in a moment. But let’s begin earlier in his journey, before God changed his name.)\n\nWhen God promised Abram that he would be the father of a son who would be the beginning of a mighty nation, Abram believed God and it was “credited to him as righteousness” (Genesis 15:6). But his faith didn’t keep him taking from matters into his own hands. He had a son, but not by his wife Sarai. She had been unable to conceive, so, at Sarai’s prompting, Abram slept with Sarai’s servant Hagar. Ishmael was born, but he was not the son of promise. \n\nAbram and his wife took the promise God had made to them and tried to bring it about on their own terms. In a sense, it was the fall all over again (Genesis 3). It wasn’t Abram’s finest moment, but it’s not the end of his story. After his failure, God didn’t abandon His promise to Abram. God had another, better plan. God’s plan was an invitation to stretch Abram’s faith.\n\nGod called Abram to a life cut off from his old practices and patterns. This would be symbolized in two ways. First, God changed his name from Abram to Abraham. Second, God instructed Abraham to be circumcised. Circumcision showed Abraham’s trust was in the Lord, not in his own flesh, to put it delicately.\n\nThis call to obedience was followed by an unbelievable promise. God would demonstrate His faithfulness to Abraham by giving he and his wife Sarah a son; they would name him Isaac. \n\nThe Bible tells us he went that very day to circumcise himself and the men of his household. \n\nCan I ask you to think about the faith it took for Abraham to honor God in circumcision when God’s promise of Isaac depended on that very part of his anatomy? Not to be crass, but the circumstances of his circumcision couldn’t have been exactly clinical, and the recovery was likely difficult. And yet, in less than a year, Abraham would be holding the reality of God’s promise in his arms.\n\nAbraham had to completely trust God for the blessing of his son Isaac. His story reminds us that God’s greatest promises often invite the greatest faith. God hadn’t just given Abraham a son, God had strengthened Abraham’s faith. \n\nOur faith must win out over our fear. Fear will cause us to fret, scheme, and take control. Fear will convince us that we can and should take matters into our own hands. Abraham’s story proves that God’s plans won’t always be accomplished in the ways we might imagine. Our faith isn’t built merely on the promises of God, but on the character of the God who makes those promises. We live in confidence that He will fulfill them in His time and in His ways.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nI have a very little baby right now. I spend most of my hours nursing her or holding her. And when she finally happens to be sleeping somewhere that’s not my arms I’m able to do other things. But the problem is my list of “necessaries” has become so long and so urgent that I can’t even decide where to begin. I lay the baby down and just stand still with glazed-over eyes, thinking, Where do I begin? This morning while she napped, I gaped at my list with sheer, uncomprehending panic. I couldn’t set myself on a course. And if you can’t find a place to start, and then stick with your plan, nothing ever gets done. I spend the moments in between nursing sessions drifting from task to task. Homeschooling, housecleaning, writing, trying to be present and available. But these responsibilities stack on top of each other, and I inevitably find my mind aimlessly wandering.\n\nEven the most focused among us are prone to wander. We allow ourselves little, innocent wanderings (like idly wondering if hummingbirds fly to Puerto Rico in the winter) or wide, damaging veers off the course (like refusing to forgive). And sometimes we flat-out run away. That’s what Hagar did. Sarai, later renamed Sarah, treated her maidservant harshly, and pregnant Hagar ran from her, into the wilderness. But the Lord saw her. He gives grace to those who can’t seem to take anymore.\n\nDo you find yourself in her shoes sometimes? Not, ahem, the impregnated maidservant of a biblical patriarch so much, but by yourself in the wilderness? Those who stray, those who run, are nevertheless beloved by Him. He still attended and cared for Hagar in the desert, and He does the same for us.\n\nGod sees us even when we can no longer see straight. His providence encompasses us no matter where we go. This is not a reason to excuse and condone waywardness, but it’s a reminder of the goodness and graciousness of God, a provocation to gratefulness and an exhortation to run to Him.\n\nHe didn’t see Hagar because of anything she’d done. We aren’t told she had faith like Abraham’s. We read nothing about her devotion to God or to righteousness. As Sarai’s maidservant, she didn’t have much of a choice in the matter when it came to bearing Ishmael. And when Sarai was mean to her, she ran off in disobedience. Of course, we can all empathize with her, but the fact of the matter is, God saw Hagar and comforted her in the desert because He is good, not because Hagar was. And that is good news for all who wander. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nMy backyard garden is an unrealized dream. A few months ago we sowed and scattered seeds with the haphazard helping hands of my four-year-old daughter. Despite multiple warnings not to do so, she dumped an entire container of bird seed alongside my hoped-for flowers. In addition, the sod we ripped up to make room for the garden left rows of roots that like to pop up, and no matter how many times I rip them out, they always seem to show up again. \n\nNow I cannot tell weeds from future blooms, and the hours I spent trying to cultivate a beautiful cut-flower garden seem fruitless (or, flowerless). I know that eventually, the real flowers will bloom, and then I can root out the weeds that have grown. \n\nSarah’s life was marked by a root of bitterness, a weed that made her scoff at God’s promise and treat Hagar with contempt and cruelty. Bitterness was born out of her perceived injustice: her husband fathering a son with her slave (Genesis 21:9–10), her own inability to have children (11:30), and the seemingly-impossible promise God made to her (18:10). \n\nIf you told me today that in two months, my garden would be bursting with zinnias, peonies, snapdragons, and gardenias, I would probably laugh. My track record, like Sarah’s in childbearing, is sparse. I have nothing on which to base my hope of a bountiful flower harvest. \n\nWhat did Sarah have to fight back against her bitterness? She had a promise, a word spoken by the Author of promises. But still, she laughed. \n\nThankfully, the fulfillment of God’s promise to Sarah did not rest on her. God did not bless her with a son, Isaac, because of her attitude. It was not a reward based on piety, or character, or anything other than His word. And His word is always good, no matter the shape and bent of our hearts. \n\nBitterness has deep roots in my own heart, and daily I have to push against its influence. I think, You deserve this. You’ve earned it. And then I compare my circumstances to someone else’s, reasoning, What has she done to get that thing (job, house, vacation, experience, complexion)? I am just as worthy!\n\nThe problem with this false narrative is this: not only is it deeply baked in privilege, but it feeds into the merit-based culture we live in. Entitlement begets merit, which begets more entitlement, and so on. The culture of God’s kingdom is anchored neither in merit nor in entitlement, but rather in the goodness and faithfulness of God. \n\nSarah had neither merit nor entitlement. She seemed to have bitterness where faithfulness should grow. But what she did have was the promise, and so she became the mother of the promise by God’s grace alone. \n\nOn bitterness, poet and hymn writer Anne Ross Cousin said this in her poem, “In Immanuel’s Land”:\n\nSoon shall the cup of glory Wash down earth’s bitterest woes, Soon shall the desert briar, Break in to Eden’s rose  …  I stand upon His merit,  I know no other stand Not e’en where glory dwelleth In Immanuel’s land. \n\nThe things I long for are chaff and weeds, distractions from the best promise ever made: the eternal presence of the Lord Himself. Like Sarah, I have no merit to cling to as I wait for the fulfillment of God’s promises. But I have Him, and His Word, and His merit alone. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nAny woman who has held a chubby-faced cherub in her arms surely gets squeamish at the idea of surrendering a child. Though it knots up our stomachs, the pattern of parents surrendering children to the Lord is inescapably woven throughout the Bible. \n\nWe see it with Moses’s mama as she tenderly laid him in a basket and placed him in the river (Exodus 2:1–10). Perhaps we remember our own bins of baby clothes stashed in the closet as we read about Samuel, whose mother, Hannah, gave up her toddler to serve in the temple, and then faithfully delivered a “little robe” to him each year (1 Samuel 1:1–2:21). And as we consider the life of Isaac, the promised miracle child of Abraham, we see this surrender in graphic detail. \n\nIf this is just a human story about a human family, frankly, it stinks. How could a good God ask a father to give up the child of promise he was given? How could a good father agree to such a request? It is hard to wrap our hearts around the situation. But this is more than a story about one human family. This account of Abraham and Isaac points to the bigger story. Way back in Genesis, God was showing His people a preview of the gospel. If we anxiously look away from this story or race through it to find an easier pill to swallow, we will miss the stunning parallels. \n\nIsaac carried the wood for the sacrifice on his back (Genesis 22:6).Jesus carried the cross on His back, on the way to Golgotha (John 19:17). \n\nIsaac was bound and led to the altar (Genesis 22:9).Christ was bound and led to the cross (Mark 15:1). \n\nIsaac is described as Abraham and Sarah’s beloved and “only son” (Genesis 22:2). Centuries later, God the Father would declare from heaven, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased” (Matthew 3:17). \n\nBecause of Abraham’s obedience, the angel of the Lord promised, “All the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring because you have obeyed my command” (Genesis 22:18).Because of Christ’s obedience, “[He] purchased people for God by [His] blood from every tribe and language and people and nation” (Revelation 5:9).\n\nBut these stories diverge at a critical juncture. Isaac’s life was ultimately spared (Genesis 22:11–14), but for Christ there would be no ram in the thicket. The Father would follow through with the sacrifice so that all sons and daughters could be spared. \n\nWe will all have “Isaacs” to lay down on the altar. But our stories are no more about us than Isaac’s moment on the mountain was about him. Our lives are stamped by the gospel. Every baby in the bullrushes, every “tiny robe,” every day we choose to hold our own beloveds with open palms—we are reminded that our God willingly sacrificed His beloved Son so that we might be called the children of God (John 1:12). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kimberly Girard\n\nThree years ago, we told our kids we were moving to a new city. Through tears, we told them we were choosing to follow where we believed God was leading us. My husband said he believed God would be kind to each one of us in this move because He “is good, and his faithful love endures forever; his faithfulness, through all generations” (Psalm 100:5, emphasis mine).\n\nGranted, God’s goodness didn’t always look the way we expected it to, but over these past three years, our family has experientially learned over and over again that God is indeed good and that He doesn’t stop being faithful to His people. And we see that same faithful God in Rebekah’s story.\n\nRebekah is going about the daily work the Lord has set before her when she’s asked to leave everything familiar behind and follow God into the unknown. Not only is she asked to move to a new land, but she’s also asked to marry a man she’s never seen. And she goes willingly! \n\nWhen Abraham’s servant tells Rebekah’s family this remarkable story of God’s leading, Rebekah’s father and brother declare, “This is from the Lord; we have no choice in the matter. Rebekah is here in front of you. Take her and go, and let her be a wife for your master’s son, just as the Lord has spoken” (Genesis 24:50–51).\n\nIt’s clear to Rebekah’s family and to Abraham’s servant that “a person’s steps are established by the Lord” (Psalm 37:23). They see that the Lord has appointed Rebekah for Isaac. \n\nWhile we see the faithfulness of both Rebekah and her family in how they follow God, this is also the story of a much deeper faithfulness—God’s faithfulness to His people. Rebekah’s story, my story, and all the stories of God’s children are ultimately stories of God’s unending commitment to His people. Even in the deeply painful places, God is faithful. His faithfulness is found all over this story and throughout our own lives as well. And as we see with Abraham’s servant, when we share the stories of God’s faithfulness, they lead us to worship.\n\nYou don’t have to read much further to find that Rebekah is sinful just like us. But the good news of the gospel is that God’s faithfulness isn’t contingent upon our own. “While we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). The Bible is the story of God’s faithfulness to an unfaithful people He never stops pursuing.\n\nHowever huge and daunting the unfamiliar—or even the familiar—seems today, we can trust God because He is faithful, as He was in the past and will be forever. “His mercies never end. They are new every morning; great is [His] faithfulness!” (Lamentations 3:22–23).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nThe early 2000s were a treasure trove of television game shows. If you don’t already know this by heart, let me explain. (And if you do, you are my kind of people and can pass “Go” to collect $200.) \n\nWhile I’ve always had infinite admiration for Vanna White on Wheel of Fortune, and my brother claimed he bonded best with our father over Family Feud, it was a blonde British woman named Anne Robinson who really raised the bar for game shows. Host of The Weakest Link, (which came aired at 4 pm, just in time for my elementary-school self to hop off the school bus and grab a cheese stick), Anne was known for her no-nonsense TV personality, and I adored her for it. \n\nOn the show, a team of contestants would take turns answering trivia questions with the goal of getting the most correct answers within a specific amount of time. When time was up, the team voted on the weakest link (a.k.a., the worst player in the game). Then it was time for the most memorable part of the show, when Anne would announce the loser by addressing the individual by name and proclaiming, “You are the weakest link. Goodbye.”\n\nIt’s easy to treat the story of Jacob and Esau like another episode of The Weakest Link. Which brother is doing the right thing? Who deserves favoritism? Who does God love more? \n\nFirst, we have Esau, who sells his birthright to Jacob for stew. Then, we have Jacob, who steals the blessing that was rightfully Esau’s. If I were the judge, I’d conclude that they were both at fault. They’re both weak links. \n\nEsau’s story is much like ours; he gave in to his fleshly desires and lost the most valuable thing in his possession. But he was also hurt and wronged by his own flesh and blood, his brother Jacob. It’s the oldest and truest story we know: Our flesh chose sin, and our hearts chose betrayal. Pain is a constant in our stories. We are the weakest links. And yet, God didn’t say goodbye to us in our weakness—far from it, actually. He did the exact opposite: He sent His Son to reverse the curse by bearing the weight of our sin, a burden that had rightfully been placed on us. \n\nThese stories in Genesis, set just after creation story and the Fall, and long before the birth of our Savior, show us how deeply we need redemption. We cannot be trusted with things of value like birthrights, brothers, or blessings. An intervention is necessary, and thanks be to God, an intervention is coming. But first, we must take this opportunity to realize our humanity, grieve our sin, and repent. We cannot proclaim His strength without first admitting our weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9). \n\n“And make sure that there isn’t any immoral or irreverent person like Esau, who sold his birthright in exchange for a single meal. For you know that later, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, even though he sought it with tears, because he didn’t find any opportunity for repentance” (Hebrews 12:16–17).\n\nAny average ruler (or game show, for that matter) would certainly have chosen for Esau, Jacob, you, and I to pack up our bags a very long time ago, at the onset of our failures. But because of Christ’s sacrifice, we are welcomed into eternity instead of turned away. What a prize indeed. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nWhatever my four-year-old niece is doing, she wants my sister, her mom, to be watching.\n\n“Look, Mommy!”\n“Look at this, Mommy!”\n“Look over here, Mommy!”\n\nIt’s as if whatever ball she is throwing, twirl she is doing, or somersault she is attempting doesn’t count unless her mom sees her. \n\nThis desire to be seen is innate in us all, and it doesn’t disappear with childhood. As we read today, a full-grown woman can ache with longing when she knows she is not seen.\n\nLeah is unloved and unwanted. Jacob loved her sister, Rachel, more than her. Rachel is described as “shapely and beautiful.” Leah is described as ordinary. Oh, could this story hit more close to home? Who hasn’t felt less than, like not enough in comparison to the women around you?\n\nThis story gives me flashbacks to my tall, gangly adolescent self. I knew I was neither shapely nor beautiful. I watched both of my sisters—inside and out, the most beautiful women I know—be crowned Homecoming Queen and Prom Queen and I wondered, does anyone see me? If I am not wearing a crown, am I still worth something? In high school, it’s hard to believe that you are.\n\nLeah is aware that God sees her: “The LORD has seen my affliction,” she says (Genesis 29:32). “The LORD heard that I am unloved” (v.33). But her response to God’s attention is to then desire the attention of Jacob. As she says after she bears three sons, “Surely my husband will love me now… At last my husband will become attached to me” (vv.32,34).\n\nI wonder if we are all born with an innate desire to be seen because we already are. But instead of resting in God’s attention and care, we crave the attention of others. We want the crown, the sons, the stamp of approval that will make us feel loved and seen by everyone but God.\n\nInterestingly, our story does not end with Jacob giving Leah his stamp of approval. Instead, after the birth of her last son, Judah, it is a different stamp of approval that Leah desires: “This time I will praise the Lord” (v.35). No craving for Jacob’s love. No hoping for his attachment. Her attention is now on the One who’s always paid attention to her, the One who’s loved her all along.\n\nJudah would eventually be Israel’s greatest tribe. Jesus’s bloodline would point back to Judah by name, while the others are referred to as “his brothers” (Matthew 1:2). Leah and her plight would be memorialized forever in history. But she knew none of this when she praised the Lord. \n\nWhat is the reason you feel unseen? Whose attention do you crave? Do you believe you are heard by God, seen by God? If so, this time, this day, instead of longing for the gaze of that person, or those people, rest in the gaze that is already on you. You don’t have to beg Him to “Look!” He is already looking. This time, praise the Lord.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nLaban really gave his daughters a raw deal. When he tricked Jacob into marrying Leah, he sentenced both of his girls to one truly heartbreaking marriage. Instead of enjoying sweet accord between husband and wife, both women are crowded into a bitter, vengeful squeeze of marital misery. One wife is just the right number of wives, but one man, two sisters, and their maidservants to boot is a cramped relationship for sure. Indeed, the normal strains of marriage are quite enough without having to engage in a fertility contest with your own sister. A fertility contest that Rachel was losing—the stats were 10 to 0 against Rachel before Joseph was finally born.\n\nOnce a month, my husband goes out for an evening with his friends to discuss literature. But by the time he gets home at 10pm I’ve had quite enough of sharing him with others. Marriage is a tight circle of two. Rachel and Leah were both denied the sweet intimacy that can only exist when two people are alone in a marriage. They likely both felt forgotten by both their husband and by God. And forgotten is a feeling that we can all identify with. People will absolutely forget us. Terrible marriages, absent parents, distracted friends, and even children can pass over us as they forge ahead in life.\n\nBut there is One who does not forget. God remembers His people. God remembered Rachel (Genesis 20:22). And in Scripture, when it says that God “remembers” someone, it means that He is going to intervene and help. When God remembers, He takes action (Genesis 9:15, 19:29, 30:22; Exodus 2:24, 32:13; Psalms 25:6–7, 74:2). Even though Rachel seems to only be asking Jacob for help, God remembers Rachel. He remembers, He listens, and He opens her womb (Genesis 30:1,22).\n\nIn the weirdest and most uncomfortable situations—in the deepest, saddest days—God remembers and listens. It goes without saying that His action may not be what we are asking for or what we think the situation requires, but in His sovereignty, He listens and remembers His people.\n\nRachel died in childbirth when Benjamin was born. She fought with Leah for her entire married life, and she never got to enjoy watching her own sons grow up. She didn’t get to grow old with the man she loved. It was Leah’s son, Judah, who was in the line of Christ. Rachel’s life probably did not turn out at all like she had hoped. But she was remembered by God.\n\nLife isn’t about us and what we are doing. It is easy to forget that just because things have not gone as we hoped, that does not mean that we are forgotten or abandoned. Indeed, God builds His kingdom even amidst our dashed expectations.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nGrowing up in Northern California, I spent summers along the south fork of the American River in the tiny, blink-your-eyes-and-it’s-gone town of Coloma, the heart of the gold rush valley. Summers there were sticky. Tourists from every pocket of the world came for the whitewater and left baptized by sunshine, sunscreen, and coconut frozen yogurt from the shop down the street.\n\nAlong the river, you can spot towers of smooth stones called cairns balanced one or two feet high. Although these are now little more than artistic contributions from local river folk, in ancient times, cairns served as burial monuments or ceremonial landmarks. They marked something worth remembering. \n\nThroughout Scripture, stones symbolize many different things. After Jacob’s dream, where God promises to watch over and provide for him, he is caught off guard and uses the stone lying at his head to memorialize the moment: “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it” (Genesis 28:16). Suddenly, that place was known as Bethel, the house of God, because the Lord had made His presence known there (v.19). \n\nI love that Jacob was surprised by encountering God. Aren’t we always forgetting how close He is? Embedded in us is the classic tension between head and heart: we know God is with us, though sometimes it may not feel like He is. I can’t tell you often I’ve been surprised to find Him, just when I’d feared that His silence indicated His absence.\n\nThis stone was an important step in Jacob’s journey. Because of what the Lord revealed to him in a dream, he was able to carry forward the promise of returning to his “native land” with confidence (Genesis 31:13). But I admit, I’m a little confused by the plot twist. \n\nBefore Jacob makes it home, he meets and wrestles with God. Why was this the method for receiving God’s blessing? Why couldn’t Jacob have his homecoming without a disjointed hip? Despite the paradox of blessing brought from misfortune, Jacob is so moved by encountering God’s presence that he, once again, names the place to memorialize it. \n\nWhether it’s owning a home or publishing a book or witnessing a reconciliation, my heart desires things that aren’t guaranteed. What God does promise is abundant life: new ways of thinking, of living, of being. We are no longer slaves to death. We don’t have to wait for God to inhabit a place now that His Spirit lives in us. \n\nAs we watch for the Lord together, let’s name the moment we see Him. Let’s raise a stone in remembrance. Let’s live from a place of blessing and abundance rather than scarcity, because our birthrights are no longer dependent upon our earthly lineage. Instead, we hold the heavenly birthright Christ gives us, “an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading” (1 Peter 1:4).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nSibling relationships are tough. For the entirety of my childhood, I skittered around my older sisters’ bedrooms, pilfering makeup, borrowing clothes, and denying that I’d done anything of the sort. We tattled on each other constantly. And when one of my sisters finally got her driver’s license, she was annoyed to discover that meant she would have to drive me to school every day. I wanted my sisters to like me, and yet try as I might, I was always a little bit annoying.\n\nJoseph was a little annoying too. Scripture tells us he had a habit of tattling on his brothers (Genesis 37:2). And later, when he had vivid dreams of his future glory, he didn’t tuck those dreams away to contemplate in private. Instead, he went on blabbing them to everyone! Even his father got a little tired of 17-year-old Joseph’s big head (v.10).\n\nJoseph’s story is the very last story in Genesis. It’s a hard story, one of sibling rivalry and deceit and near-murder. After all, when his brothers sold him into slavery, they had no idea how Joseph would fare in the hands of his captors. Would he survive? Did they care?\n\nThough today’s assigned Scripture gives the bookended view of Joseph’s story, it’s worth taking time to read what happened in between. In the years after his brothers sold Joseph into slavery, he was sold again, accused of rape, and then thrown into prison, where he festered for more than two years. When Pharaoh finally summoned Joseph from the dungeon to interpret his terrifying dreams (Genesis 41), Joseph’s own dreams could have easily faded into nothing in his memory. Where was the God who had promised to give him power and influence? \n\nThe truth is, Joseph’s life was far worse and far better than what he’d seen in those dreams. God had a plan for him, but that plan included much suffering. That plan included brothers that plotted evil against him. It included time in a dungeon. It included trembling before a king that could have killed him on sight. And it included rising to a position of power that ultimately saved his entire family—and the region—from starvation. What they planned for evil, God used for good (Genesis 50:20). \n\nBecause we have the rest of Scripture, we know that Joseph’s role in the redemption of the world was only the beginning. After all, that large family that arrived in Egypt to escape starvation ultimately became the nation of slaves at the beginning of Exodus—the ones crying out for a savior. There was more suffering to come. And more saving.\n\nJoseph’s life was central to God’s plan for the world. But just because we’re living out God’s plan for our life doesn’t mean there won’t be pain. We can rest assured that even what others plan for evil, God can use for good.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nOne of the hardest and most helpless feelings in the world is when another person deals carelessly with our reputations. Maybe it is an anonymous person online who publicly questions our motives. Maybe it is a commenter who glimpses one photo of our lives and makes assumptions about our parenting. Maybe it is a friend who is angry with us and then vents to our mutual friends. Maybe it is an ex-boyfriend, or an ex-husband, who is sharing a very different version of the break-up than the one we know to be true.\n\nWhenever we experience slander, unfair criticism, or unfounded accusations, it can feel as though our hard-earned reputations are being dismantled brick by brick. Everything we worked for, the integrity we established over the course of years, suddenly seems fragile and vulnerable, all because of the untested words of a gossiper.\n\nJoseph knew this helplessness well. He was a humble man of exceptional character, who spent his life climbing out of a pit, working his way up, making connections, and earning a good name, only to have it all undone by the wicked whim of a powerful woman. At least, that is how it must have seemed at the time. But that is not how Joseph’s story ended. In actuality, what determined the outcome of Joseph’s story was not power, but character.\n\nAs we now know, Joseph’s life did not end with this accusation. It seems that almost immediately, Potiphar distrusts his wife’s account. We know this because the punishment for Joseph’s supposed crime should be death, but instead, Potiphar only imprisons him. He is, in essence, not giving Joseph what he deserves. What this tells us is that Joseph’s character is influencing the outcome, and it would continue to do so for years.\n\nIn the chapters that follow, Joseph’s character opens doors for him. He gains favor with those in authority over him, until he eventually receives authority himself. Joseph is forever remembered as a noble man and a great leader; Potiphar’s wife, on the other hand, is only remembered for one of the worst decisions of her life. We don’t even know her name.\n\nIt is difficult to be on the receiving end of slander or a false accusation, but this story comforts us with this truth: your character is louder than you think. Character always reveals who you really are, and no amount of power, lies, or manipulation can hide it. This is a comfort for those of us who choose the way of holiness, but it is also a warning for when we don’t. \n\nThe sin of Potiphar’s wife was not simply lust, but the abuse of power, and none of us is immune to it. Our need for control—even when it is directed toward good and noble purposes—can lead us to compromise our integrity. “The ends justify the means,” we reason. But this is not the logic of godly character. Instead, we follow a Savior who chose to be falsely accused rather than exert His will by force. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nObedience always brings blessings. I’ve heard that message preached, but Exodus 1 seems to teach us something different. It reminds us that we must be very careful with what we expect for our obedience and what we define as a blessing. Today’s reading commends a faith that reverently fears God, not the opinions, whims, and wants of men.\n\nFearing the growth and potential power of the Hebrew slave nation, Pharaoh orders the midwives who assisted the Hebrew women in childbirth to kill all the boys they helped to deliver. The Bible records the names of these women: Shiphrah and Puah. Pharaoh commands them to be His co-conspirators in a plot to decimate the Hebrew population. But they never carry out Pharaoh’s plan. It is a bold, faith-filled move. But the results are a mixed bag of blessings. We can learn a few important lessons from their example.\n\nWe must be careful not to assume that our obedience clears the path to ease and happiness. The midwives feared God more than they feared Pharaoh. But their act of rebellion, though honorable, moved Pharaoh to ratchet up his plan against Israel, and he commanded that all baby boys be thrown into the Nile. This is why we must be careful not to barter our obedience for God’s blessings. Our blessing may be things we cannot see.\n\nIn the case of the midwives, they were rewarded with tangible gifts. The Bible records that God blessed the women with families of their own. There is no formula that says our obedience will unlock the desires of our hearts. However, God is the Giver of every good thing we receive (James 1:17).\n\nIt’s not entirely clear if the midwives were Hebrew or Egyptian. Either way their faith was tested. Yes, God blessed the midwives with families of their own, but the very next verse says that Pharaoh now commanded that all Hebrew boys be thrown in the Nile. Would the faithful midwives now lose their own children to Pharaoh’s evil mandate? Or were the midwives Egyptian women who would watch helplessly as even more baby boys were killed? God saw their faithfulness and would now grow their faith even more. \n\nOur greatest blessings and most precious rewards are the eternal ones. I want God to make me bolder, refine my character, and chisel away my selfishness. Those treasures won’t always feel like blessings. \n\nThe overwhelming context of Scripture points to these same truths. Obedience doesn’t guarantee or broker blessings. Obedience must be motivated by faith in God, not the fear of man. Like Shiphrah and Puah, we are commended to act in ways that prove our confidence in our God who is always faithful, keeps His word, and blesses His people. I’d like to be the kind of person who trusts God to give and define my blessings. I’d rather be changed for eternity than comforted temporarily.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nMoses is a hero of our faith. His life is the stuff of legends—found as a baby in the Nile, talking to a burning bush, heralding plagues in Egypt, parting the Red Sea. Who can claim a life as epic as the one Moses got to lead? And what made the difference? What made this man so dramatically different from everyone else?\n\nWe are inclined to picture Moses with the face of Charlton Heston—square-jawed, steely-eyed, and full of manly courage. But his first, second, and third responses to God’s call were fear and squirming. He eventually answered the call, but courage certainly wasn’t what made him stand apart. Moses even doubted God’s ability to work through him. In his self-doubt and excuse-making, we see how afraid Moses was, running from the serpent, and trying to wiggle out of his holy calling.\n\nHere is what makes all the difference: God’s promised presence. He said to Moses, “I will certainly be with you” (Exodus 3:12). Moses was great because he stood on holy ground (vv.5–6). He stood on the foundation of God’s faithfulness. Every word from his mouth, or from the mouth of Aaron, was powerful because they were God’s words. The staff in his hands was the tool of God’s work of deliverance. Again and again, the assurance that God gave to trembling Moses was that He, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, would be the true deliverer of Israel.\n\nWhen Israel rejected Moses’s leadership, they were truly rejecting God; Moses was simply the minister of God’s will and word to His people. In this we see two great truths that apply directly to us today. First, God Himself is the true deliverer. We do not lead others out of bondage. Only Christ does. We do not save.. Only the hand of God does.\n\nSecond, our own calling, like that of Moses, is to be willing instruments in the hands of God. It does not matter how feeble our voices, how weak our knees, how trembling our hearts. God’s power is made perfect in our weakness. The greatest deeds of our lives will be those in which we are malleable to His will, and in which He receives all the glory. He must increase, and we must decrease.\n\nGod graciously invites fearful and inarticulate servants like us to join in His great work in the world. There was nothing extraordinarily special about Moses, except that He was chosen by God to stand on holy ground. And thanks be to God, that the true work of deliverance is already accomplished fully by His own Son Jesus Christ!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nLet me be straight with you. I was excited to share a few reflections about “Men and Women in the Word.” But I wasn’t super stoked when I saw that I’d been assigned to write about Aaron. Aaron. Really? Moses’s right-hand man? The guy who made the golden calf? What more was there to say about a person who nearly caused the destruction of Israel a few days after God parted the Red Sea?\n\nI wrote down a few adjectives—words that described my assumptions about Aaron. To me, he seemed like a charismatic guy. A classic over-achiever. A man who was called by God, but also bent on pleasing people. The more I jotted down the adjectives, the more I realized I was describing myself.\n\nAaron has a complicated story. Before God appeared to Moses in the burning bush, He’d already called Aaron to start moving toward Moses to help him. In the story of Israel’s redemption, Aaron played a massive role—speaking on behalf of Moses, who spoke on behalf of God. He saw God’s miracles firsthand. He called down plagues to strike Egypt and spare Israel. He walked through the Red Sea on dry land, surrounded by water like walls. \n\nNot long after those miracles, Moses left Aaron in charge while he went to Mount Sinai and received instructions from God on how to build the future tabernacle (Exodus 25–31). Moses had been on the mountain for more than 40 days, longer than he’d planned to be gone. Soon, cajoled by the Israelites, Aaron assumed Moses had died. While Moses was hearing instructions from the Lord, Aaron was busy building a golden calf.\n\nUnable to wait patiently for God’s instructions, he moved on with his own plans. Comfortable in his position of power, he used his gifts to lead people astray. Aaron was of feeble mind and character, and he was quick to turn his back on the one true God.\n\nAs Moses came down from the mountain to see this ghastly scene, the truth was revealed. God may have called Aaron into holy service, but Aaron wasn’t holy. He was impatient, charismatic, and reckless. He was a sinner in need of saving. Aaron was just like me. \n\nThough God went on to punish the Israelites for their sin, he spared Aaron. In His mercy and grace, God allowed Aaron to see the tabernacle, fully built. Compared to the golden calf Aaron created with his feeble hands, the tabernacle was a spectacle of beauty, a moveable house constructed with expertise to God’s exact specifications (Exodus 4:30). Aaron was the first high priest to serve there, charged with carrying out sacrifices for the people. In that role, I imagine Aaron came to understand his need for atonement. As he sacrificed real animals, spilling real blood, I wonder if he continued to repent over that first, false image that he’d created.\n\nWe are all Aaron. Called by God, and yet capable of turning our back on Him. Gifted, and yet capable of using those gifts for our own glory rather than God’s instruction. We are all sinners, in need of an atoning sacrifice. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nWe assume Miriam was simply the sister who watched her barely weaned brother float helplessly down the river, then witnessed his miraculous rescue by the hands of Pharaoh’s daughter. But there is so much more to her.\n\nIt was Miriam who boldly offered to retrieve a nurse for the princess and then ran to her mother to reunite her with her boy. (What a girl!)\n\nMiriam saw her people spared from the twelve plagues that struck all of Egypt. She then fled with her people when Pharoah miraculously let them go. \n\nWith dry sand of the Red Sea between her toes, Miriam watched towers of water stand at attention for her people’s passing. \n\nIt was Miriam who busted out her tambourine and led the people of God in a holy conga line to celebrate Israel’s deliverance: “Sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted; he has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea” (Exodus 15:21).\n\nThis is a woman of conviction. This is a woman of faith. This is a woman of praise. \n\nBut she is not (and neither are we) a woman without need for a Savior. \n\nNumbers 12 feels out of place in the snapshots of Miriam’s life. It reads more like a scene from one of our family vacations. The siblings are at each other’s throats. What about exactly? The Lord’s favor. Who deserves it? Who doesn’t? Who has more than their share?\n\nTurns out even prophetesses are prone to spiritual envy. \n\nWith rebellion in their hearts, Miriam and Aaron grumbled. “They said, ‘Does the LORD speak only through Moses? Does he not also speak through us?’ And the Lord heard it” (v.2). The Lord responded in anger, striking Miriam with temporary leprosy. Why? Because here’s the truth about spiritual envy: it uncovers our lack of faith.\n\nWhen we resent and covet the blessings God has given others… When we worry someone else’s adequacy is a commentary on our inadequacy… When we look at someone else’s piece-of-the-kingdom pie and worry we will get the crumbs left over… When we want to trade in our gifts for something more “flashy”… \n\nSpiritual envy reveals little pockets in our hearts that are still absent of faith, corners not yet convinced that God is faithful and good. We doubt even when we’ve been delivered, after we’ve seen Him make a way where there seemed to be no way. This means we cannot rest on yesterday’s praise, because we will never stop needing Him. Life will never stop giving us opportunities to choose to trust that He will come through. \n\nYes, Miriam is a woman who lived her life for God’s glory. But He is glorified in her weakness, as is He is in her faith. Her dramatic delivery from slavery points to a more important need. She needed to be rescued from her sinful heart. She needed to be set free from her shame. So do I. So do you. Because Jesus is faithful to do it, let us bust out our tambourines in praise. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nIn the past, I’ve made an idol out of calling. There were countless times when I cried out to God, asking Him to “make it clear” what it is He wanted me to do with this life. While it’s true that I really did want to know how to spend my days and focus my attention, what I really wanted was certainty. I thought if God could just point me in the generally right direction, I could start hustling to make something of myself. What I wanted was the assurance I wouldn’t fail. I wanted control. \n\nBut God doesn’t offer us the assurance of this kind of control. He does, however, promise His faithful love and His promise to be present with His people (Deuteronomy 31:6; Hebrews 13:5). Our God is not the means to an end—He’s the beginning, the end, and everything in between (Revelation 22:13). And so calling isn’t so much a sure destination but an invitation into deeper relationship with our Creator God. \n\nOne of the ways God has invited me to experience Him is through the gifts He’s given me. When I read about Bezalel in Exodus 31, I see God’s same commitment to be present through both calling and gifting. \n\nThe LORD also spoke to Moses: “Look, I have appointed by name Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. I have filled him with God’s Spirit,  with wisdom, understanding, and ability in every craft to design artistic works”  (Exodus 31:1–5, emphasis mine).\n\nBezalel was an artisan with a BIG call on his life: to lead in the creation of the tabernacle, where God would take up residence with His people. Still, God didn’t leave Bezalel to fend for himself in the face of such an enormous undertaking. He sent Himself—His Spirit.\n\nThe Hebrew word Ruach is translated as “God’s Spirit,” and here it refers to God’s personal presence and power coming forth to empower God’s people to do the specific tasks He’s called us to do. The Creator of the universe (Genesis 1:1) called Bezalel to create something God surely could’ve made on His own—no doubt perfectly and far more efficiently. Instead, He gifted and called a man like Bezalel. Why?\n\nBecause our God is relational, revealing His glory through creation and those who bear His image (Genesis 1:26–28). He doesn’t need us or the work of our hands, but He wants us and He invites us to share in His work. By His Spirit He gives us gifts to do that work (1 Corinthians 12:4–7). It’s a precedent He set in the garden. God is about bringing eternity here to earth now, creating space for Him to dwell—to tabernacle—with His people. For those who call Jesus Christ Lord, that meeting place is now within us, by His Spirit (2 Corinthians 6:16).\n\nWhatever the call, He’s already given us everything we need to accomplish it (1 Peter 1:3). The gifts He gives us are a vehicle through which we can know Him better, go on mission with Him to accomplish His will, bring Him glory, and care for His creation and people. Apart from Him, our gifts are useless, our calling aimless (John 15:5). But in His presence is complete and utter joy (Psalm 16:11) as we partner with Him in the restoration of His creation.\n\n",

I didn’t think I could answer God’s call to carry a baby full-term if that baby would not be mine to keep. I looked at the journey before me and the assignment God had given to me, and thought, “There is no way I can do this. I’m not strong enough.”\n\nHave you ever felt like this? Have you ever lost sleep over the fear of a circumstance? Have you ever been afraid that God might ask you to do something you cannot do?\n\nI believe that God wants to redeem our worries, and we would do well to learn from the story of Joshua. God had a very important assignment for Joshua. Moses was about to die, and it was time for the Israelites to finally stop their desert wandering to find a permanent home in the promised land. God wanted Joshua to lead them into their first battle at Jericho. He said to Joshua: “Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go” (Joshua 1:9).\n\nJoshua’s task was scary (think war and death), victory looked improbable (think impenetrable fortified city), and a whole nation hung in the balance (think no room for doubt). God knew all of this, and yet what did He say to Joshua? No matter what lies before you, “be strong and courageous” (Joshua 1:6).\n\nHow could God ask this of Joshua? How could God ask me to be brave and carry a child I knew would pass away?\n\nIt’s because of this:\n\nThe Lord will never leave us (Joshua 1:9). We might not know the twists and turns of the journey before us. But we can stand confidently, knowing the Lord will never ever leave our side.\n\nIt is the Lord God who fights for us (Joshua 23:3). God does the fighting! Joshua’s strength, my courage, your bravery—these do not come from within ourselves. No! They come from the Holy Spirit, and His power has no limits.\n\nThe Lord our God is worthy of our love and devotion (Joshua 23:9–11). God gave Joshua and his people many commands, but He gave clear emphasis to this one in particular. Jesus gives us a similar command: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself” (Luke 10:27). This is the call we’ve been given, and if our eyes are on the one who calls us, then no matter what life throws at us or what impenetrable circumstance lies ahead, we will be okay.\n\nI named my son Gideon. And during those 90 minutes he lived in my arms, God proved all of His promises to be true. Our God will never leave us. He will always fight for us. And He delights in our love for Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nI had this sneaking feeling that I was going to lock myself out of the office one day. Every once in a while, it would cross my mind that I should hide a key somewhere, just in case, but then I’d brush that thought aside. Well, what do you know, today was the day! Of course, my coworkers were gone for the day, and the second the door latched behind me I knew I’d forgotten my key. They say hindsight is 20/20, but it doesn’t do you much good when you’re trapped on the wrong side of the door, pulling up Google on your phone to find a locksmith. \n\nSometimes we feel that nagging urge to act, and we just stuff it down. Getting locked out of an office is a minor inconvenience, but what about when the urge to act comes from the Lord? What about when that holy nudge requires you to step out in faith? \n\nRahab is a woman who saw what was coming and chose to act in obedience. She didn’t obey because she was an especially godly person. Far from it, in fact. The book of Joshua tells us that Rahab was a prostitute. But despite her moral failings, Rahab recognized the power of God. When Joshua’s two spies were in need of a hiding place, Rahab sensed they were men of the one true God. Though she barely knew this God, Rahab put her faith in Him and betrayed her own king (Hebrews 11:31). \n\nHow did a woman living so far from God take such an enormous leap of faith? A single act of courage, that’s how. That’s all it took to completely change the future for Rahab and her family. Although she had only heard of the power and goodness of God, she recognized what He was doing and stepped out in faith. This foresight saved the lives of Rahab and her family, and she went on to become part of the lineage of Jesus Himself (Matthew 1:1–6). \n\nJust as God worked through Rahab, He delights in using women from every walk of life to tell His grand story of redemption. It doesn’t matter what you have or haven’t done in the past. You don’t need to be a “perfect Christian” for God to call you to action. You don’t need to be a perfect Christian to listen to that still, small voice and “see it coming,” whatever it may be. God does not wait for us to get it together in order to weave us into His plan of redemption. “Instead, God has chosen what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen what is weak in the world to shame the strong” (1 Corinthians 1:27). \n\nIf you are hearing a voice that says you can’t be used by God, that you’re too much of this or too little of that, let me tell you that voice is not from the Lord. Maybe God’s given you a dream, but you’re not taking the next step because of these critical voices. Would you join me in throwing off that spirit of condemnation? Our courage comes not because we believe we are strong, but because we know that God can do anything. If He calls us He will also equip us for His work. Let’s be women who see what God is doing, and follow Him in faith. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nAbout ten years ago, my husband and I, newly married and eager to serve, volunteered to teach the preschoolers at our little church. Most Sundays were a blur of crayons and goldfish crackers, and our primary goal was for each child to take home a scribbled-on coloring sheet as proof that we tried to teach them something about Jesus. \n\nBut I remember one Sunday morning, we arrived to teach a lesson plan about Deborah, Barak, and Jael. I skimmed the story and shot a worried glance at my husband. We were supposed to teach this story? About a woman who drives a tent peg through the head of a military leader? To three-and-four-year olds? I had not had enough coffee for that. \n\nI actually don’t remember what we did that day in class, but I don’t think we read the kids that part of the story. It’s the part of the story that most of us remember, because it’s wild and gruesome, though full of strong women. All of that is true, of course, but at its heart, the story of Deborah and Barak and Jael and Sisera is about God and having confidence in Him. \n\nA lot can be said and unpacked about Barak and his trepidation, the seemingly impossible battle he faced, and how his attitude contrasted with Deborah’s, and later Jael’s. But this story offers us more than a study of human weakness overwhelmed by the glory and power of God; it offers us a picture of a woman, strong and wise, counted upon by the whole nation of Israel and chosen by God, who walked in obedience to Yahweh. \n\nDeborah heard from God, shared His Word with Barak, and supported Barak as he reluctantly followed God’s order. Deborah rebuked him when necessary but still went with him into battle. And then, after the victory against Sisera’s army and Sisera’s gruesome death at the hands of Jael, Deborah and Barak sang of praise. \n\nTheir song is a rich poem, full of beauty and truth and focused on the glory of God—how He delivered His people and destroyed His enemies. Deborah was a woman inspired by God’s Word and His faithfulness to her people. She was unafraid because she knew that come what may, our God fights for those who trust in Him (Deuteronomy 20:3–4). May God’s Word so fuel us to stand for His truth, to support our brothers and sisters in faith, and to sing His glory for the rest of our earthly lives. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nI am not like the child who keeps asking. I am like the one who asks once, receives a “no,” and leaves dejected. Persistence is not a particularly strong skill of mine, and it takes a great deal of attention for me to know what I desire most of the time. This may be rare. I know many women whose desires are potent, present, and always before them. They posture themselves before God asking and asking and asking again for Him to meet their desires. We have all been given different measures of faith (Romans 12:3).\n\nIn this passage, Gideon is an asker who won’t take “yes” for an answer. He wants reassurance even after God responds to his request: “‘Don’t be angry with me; let me speak one more time. Please allow me to make one more test with the fleece. Let it remain dry, and the dew be all over the ground’” (Judges 6:39). In the end, God gives him the reassurance he’s asked for: God’s presence goes with Gideon in battle.\n\nI sometimes wonder why God entertained Gideon’s request. Was God bolstering Gideon’s faith, bit by bit, before leading Gideon into battle? After all, God had already answered Gideon. But God met Gideon right where he was, giving him what he needed in the moment, progressing Gideon’s faith—growing it, bolstering it, and filling it to overflowing.\n\nWhen we ask God for something again and again, it doesn’t always mean we’re petulant children, whining about how unfair life is. Sometimes it means we’re inching closer and closer to seeing the enormity of God’s overwhelming help, love, and presence, which seem almost too good to be true.\n\nWhen we ask God for what we don’t think is humanly possible, we acknowledge our utter inability to bring it to pass. We submit to the truth of His absolute sovereignty over all things. This is what Gideon shows us about God and man: the beautiful practice of God’s children seeking and asking, and the spectacular gift of God’s presence with us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nThe height of a Disney princess ranges from five foot four to five foot seven—nothing more, nothing less. How do I know this, you ask? It’s the one fact that shattered all of my childhood aspirations in an instant. Standing at five foot ten, I’ve come to resent the last three inches that kept me from frolicking around the Magic Kingdom as Ariel, Belle, Snow White, or Pocahontas. It wasn’t just some childhood fantasy; it was a potential career path, guys.\n\nI realize this is not that big of a deal. If I were five foot four, I probably would have had aspirations of being in the WNBA, falling several inches below the basketball hoop. Yes, we’ve all wished for more or for less, or just to step on over to the other side of the fence where the grass sure does look a whole lot greener. \n\nWe’ve all had those Goldilocks moments in our lives, times when the porridge is too hot or the chair is too small, the job is too difficult, the relationship too painful, or the circumstance too out of control.\n\nAfter losing her husband and two sons, it’s no surprise that Naomi felt as if her life had become more than she could handle. And so when Ruth and Orpah, her daughters-in-law, offer to stay with her, Naomi tells them, “No, my daughters, my life is much too bitter for you to share, because the LORD’s hand has turned against me” (Ruth 1:13).\n\nToo bitter. \n\nHow often do we believe God has turned against us when life begins to feel like too much? And yet the overwhelming circumstances we find ourselves in, the ones that make us feel like we’ll never be enough or have enough—these are the richest soil for God’s redemption. He loves to meet us in the places where we’ve given up and then shower us with His abundance. \n\nRuth could have easily walked away from Naomi, leaving her mother-in-law alone in her bitterness, just as God could have easily rejected us in our unfaithfulness. Thankfully, that’s not how the story goes. Both women chose to travel together, dusting off their wounds and collecting their sorrows. They didn’t know what they would find next, but they left “Moab, because [Naomi] had heard in Moab that the Lord had paid attention to his people’s need by providing them food” (v.6).\n\nIf you’ve read this story before, you already know that God provided much more than food for these women. He gave Ruth a new husband, and in turn, Naomi also received a new son. But the story of Naomi and Ruth is about more than a God who will give us whatever we want and make all our dreams come true, if we’ll just muster up enough faith to believe in Him. This story, and all of Scripture, is about a God who is faithful when we are not.\n\nLet us look to the One whose power is perfected in our weakness; He promises that His grace is exactly what we need—what our sin requires—and it is sufficient for everyone who leaves behind the ways of this world in order to follow Him (2 Corinthians 12:9). “Blessed be the LORD,” who redeems and restores (Ruth 4:14).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Maria Furlough\n\nHave you ever sobbed so hard that your body shook? Hot tears welling up from places you didn’t even know existed? Did you wonder if the tears would ever stop? I’ve cried tears like that. I’ve felt that kind of desperation, and yet somehow and in some way it’s there that God has proven He is exactly who He says He is. \n\nIn today’s reading we see that Hannah has been there too. As so many women who have come after her, Hannah was greatly grieved by her circumstances. “Deeply hurt, Hannah prayed to the LORD and wept with many tears” (1 Samuel 1:10). Through her story, we are given an example of what it means to approach God honestly with our pain. \n\nGod cares about our pain. He knows how many tears you and I have cried (Psalm 56:8). Just as He cared about Hannah’s deep pain, He cares about yours and mine too. God wants us to know what to do with our hurt, and that He will meet us in our suffering. We can start by taking our pain to Him in bold and honest prayer, just as Hannah did: \n\n“LORD of Armies, if you will take notice of your servant’s affliction,  remember and not forget me, and give your servant a son,  I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life” (v.11). \n\nGod hears the cries of our hearts. “The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears, and rescues them from all their troubles” (Psalm 34:17). He is worthy of our trust, which is something Hannah truly believed. Scripture tells us that after praying, “Hannah went on her way; she ate and no longer looked despondent” (1 Samuel 1:18). Hannah did not yet know whether God was going to give her a child, but she went away confident that He had heard her plea. As should we!\n\nGod comforts us in our pain. I understand the relief that comes from honest prayer. After losing my son, I prayed to God repeatedly, sobbing, “I want him back right now!” In that deep, unimaginable pain, I found Him to be the tender God of all comfort (2 Corinthians 1:3). I also found that His Word is true; He truly “is near the brokenhearted; he saves those crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18).\n\nWe don’t need to be ashamed of our pain. When Eli accuses Hannah of being drunk, she tells him like it is: “I am a woman with a broken heart” (v.15). No excuses, no shame, no embarrassment. Sadness is part of the human condition that points to our need for a saving God. It is okay to be sad. Hannah’s honest prayer points to God’s reliable power and goodness. And so she declares, “There is no one holy like the LORD. There is no one besides you!” (1 Samuel 2:2). \n\nGod did give Hannah a son, yes, but more than that, He gave her the peace of His presence. He is with us as well. In His presence, may we learn to rejoice in Him always—regardless of our circumstances. May we learn to bring Him the deepest longings of our hearts, “through prayer and petition with thanksgiving. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding” will be ours (Philippians 4:4,6–7). He waits to comfort us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nI was in the sixth grade the first time I felt a desire to open my Bible on my own. I’d had a particularly rough day at school (aren’t middle school girls the worst?), and as I sobbed into my New Kids on the Block pillow, suddenly my pink Precious Moments Bible seemed to call to me from the bookshelf. It wasn’t an audible sound, just a subtle heart tug toward the Word of God I’d never felt before that moment. I didn’t know a psalm from a proverb, couldn’t articulate the gospel, and had no way of knowing how God’s Word would eventually transform me. I just knew I needed comfort and thought the Bible might be a straw worth grasping for. \n\nA tiny spark was kindled, but the ember was enough to keep me reading through middle school and into high school, when I would eventually surrender my life to Christ. The spark is now a bonfire that consumes my life. Like the psalmist, I declare, “Instruction from your lips is better for me than thousands of gold and silver pieces” (Psalm 119:72). God’s Word is my greatest treasure. \n\nThe Bible tells us, “Samuel did not yet know the Lord, because the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him” (1 Samuel 3:7). And yet the Lord was clearly speaking to the boy. Though Samuel’s inexperience with the voice of God made him slow to respond, the Lord kept patiently nudging until eventually, “Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and he fulfilled everything Samuel prophesied. All Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was a confirmed prophet of the Lord” (vv.19–20). \n\nHe is the hound of heaven. He pursues us when we are still running in glad rebellion. He woos us when our hearts are still turned toward lesser loves. He shepherds before we, His sheep, can distinguish the sound of His voice. Truly, “God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). \n\nSamuel learned to serve the God who speaks. I have learned to love the One whose story I first glimpsed in the pages of a little pink Bible. It’s true that when we seek, we find Him. And when we knock, He always opens the door (Matthew 7:7–8). But the Lord, in His kindness, also whispers to us before our hearts know how to listen. He loves us, even if our hearts are too broken to love Him back (1 John 4:9). Because He speaks, we can know Him—and that is a reason to rejoice.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nFor me, reading through 1 Samuel is like learning Israel’s history for the very first time. I’ve been so fascinated by this story because Saul seems so well-intentioned, at least based on outward appearance. But when I look a little closer, I realize that Saul was a man of great fear, one who was constantly seeking the approval of other people. What’s more, Saul shrouded his insecurity in half-obedience to the Lord. \n\nUgh. Knife in the gut. \n\nI could so easily replace Saul’s name with my own in both of the sentences above. I am a woman of great fear. I hide all of my insecurity by pretending I’m following the Lord, when really, I’m looking for other people’s approval.\n\nIn today’s reading, Saul’s habit of half-obedience is on full display—twice. In Chapter 10, the prophet Samuel is surrounded by crowds, and the people are looking around, trying to find Saul to put a crown on his head and officially make him their king. Saul already knows he’s been chosen, but he’s so very fearful of the job that he literally goes and hides himself in a big pile of baggage (1 Samuel 10:22).\n\nThe metaphor is too good to pass up. Hiding in baggage? Yep, I totally do that too. And I think I do it for two paradoxical reasons. First, I hide because I’m afraid; I’d much rather be hiding in the shadows than be up front where if I fall or make a mistake, people will see. The baggage—my past mistakes, what other people have said about me, the lies I believe about myself—allows me to keep a safe distance from any kind of leadership.\n\nI also hide because I want to be important enough to be found. Scripture tells us that after Saul hid himself, the people ran and brought him out, shouting, “Long live the king!” (v.24). That must have felt nice. He was so important, that even though he was hiding, the people wouldn’t let him hide for long. They came and found him and put him in the spotlight. Maybe that’s what Saul really wanted: to feel chosen by the people. Perhaps being anointed by God wasn’t enough, because he wanted the seal of approval from the people more. \n\nIn Chapter 13, Saul commits a sin fatal to his kingship when he offers burnt offerings on the altar only entrusted to Samuel (vv.1–14). His action is one of half-obedience. He was told to wait, and he did wait—but only for so long. He knew that there would be sacrifices, and so he took those sacrifices into his own hands. He wanted to prove to the men around him that he was doing something. He was afraid of being deserted, not by God, but by his soldiers. Once again, his obedience to God was only a farce to hide his reliance upon others. Saul feared man—not God. \n\nBut here’s the thing: God had already chosen Saul, and God has already chosen us (1 Peter 2:9; Ephesians 1:4). We do not need to hide. And we do not need to be found, because we will never be deserted by Him. Even if everyone else falls away, even when we fail, God will never desert us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nLast year, I turned 30, and my best friend threw me a surprise party to end all surprise parties. It included an original song, a tropical photo booth, fifty of my favorite people, and a game that requires you to eat a donut off a string (a not-so-subtle nod to her tenth birthday, where we played the same game and I had a crumb stuck in my eye for the rest of the night). For me, that birthday signaled two things: the incredible blessing of my friends and the end of my youth. \n\nTurning 30 kind of makes you rethink all of your life choices. \n\nAlthough my feelings about growing older were a little melodramatic, the truth is that things were changing. My body just isn’t twenty anymore. \n\nI find it interesting that in 1 Samuel, the Lord rejects what the prophet believes is obvious king material—physical appeal and strength—but favors David, who is also handsome with “beautiful eyes” (16:12). The qualifying trait here can’t be physical appearance because God makes it clear in His choice that “humans see what is visible, but the LORD sees the heart” (v.7). So, why David? He had the looks and health he would need for success, but we’re also told that he had a heart that would carry out the Lord’s will (Acts 13:22). That soft heart always appears to be key to spiritual flourishing. \n\nAlthough David’s good health no doubt benefited his leadership, it was his devotion to God that helped guard him against ultimate destruction. When his youth and virility waned, along with many of the characteristics that traditionally make for a great king, he still had a heart overflowing with praise.    \n\nSurrounded by friends and family at that surprise party, I imagine I felt a sliver of what David did when he burned with thanksgiving for God’s blessing. When I look back on my life thus far through a kingdom-oriented lens, my sorrow for things lost slowly turns to gratitude for things given. Sure, I wish my eyes didn’t look so permanently tired and my muscles moved like hot taffy, rather than a seat belt after stopping short. But when I assess the work of God in my life, and in the lives of others, it can be too overwhelming to bear sometimes. Each fine line and sore ligament serves as a testimony to the adventure of being sanctified.\n\nPeople may only look at you skin deep, but our Lord sees the wild rivers of courage, affection, and sacrifice under the surface. It’s an upside-down kingdom, after all. Whoever surrenders their youth finds wisdom and maturity (hopefully)—and whoever loses their life for the sake of Christ will find it (Matthew 10:39). \n\nNo matter what my appearance or circumstances or achievements or health status indicates, I want to echo the words of King David: “For You, Lord GOD, have spoken, and with Your blessing Your servant’s house will be blessed forever” (2 Samuel 7:29). The blessing God gave David’s lineage, that eventually gave way to Christ, continues into our lives today. We can never age out of it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScrolling through social media, you’re likely to see posts with comment threads a mile long. If you dare to unfold those threads, they’re often divisive and negative. The distance created by an online world makes it easier for tempers to flare and harsh words to be thrown like daggers. I find myself wanting to retreat from social media for this very reason. When we sense danger, many of us have a tendency either to jump into the fight or to take flight. But the story of Abigail offers us a third and better way to respond. \n\nIt couldn’t have been easy for the “intelligent and beautiful” Abigail to be married to Nabal (1 Samuel 25:3). He was a foolish and harsh man, and when David sent his young men to him for provisions, Nabal almost incited a war. Nabal’s lack of generosity sparked David’s temper, and David began planning his retaliation. \n\nOnce Abigail heard what was going on, she took action—but not to join in the fight or to run for cover. While her husband had been unnecessarily loud and offensive and David was quick to seek revenge, Abigail was a swift peacemaker. With David organizing his army and calling for blood, others may have assumed a battle was inevitable. But Abigail still had hope that things could be resolved peacefully. With wisdom, she discerned how to repair an extremely heated situation. Abigail approached David with humility and generosity, and was able to bring healing to a gaping wound caused by her husband’s foolishness. \n\nAbigail helped bring peace to two men, thus saving many lives from death and destruction. Jesus praised peacemaking saying, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God” (Matthew 5:9, NIV). Not only did Jesus value the virtue of peacemaking, but He embodied it. He chose to lay down His life in order to offer true and everlasting peace to all people through His death and resurrection. \n\nThe way Abigail responded is beautiful because it mirrors the heart of God. Scripture tells us that the new heavens and new earth will be a place with no need for weapons or war (Isaiah 2:4). In a divided and conflicted world, we are called to be agents of peace. Just as Abigail could have easily given up hope, it can be tempting for us to think the problems in our society are unsolvable. But Christ has can bring peace to the darkest situations. Our God can breathe life into the driest of bones. Instead of fighting or retreating, let’s respond to conflict around us with discernment and generosity in the power of the Holy Spirit. Then our actions of peace will be a witness to the heart of our loving Creator. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nEditor’s Note: Some passages in Scripture deal in subject matter which might be especially painful for some readers. Though many of the wounds we receive in this life are deeply personal and unimaginably painful, when they appear in God’s Word, we are reminded that He sees them. Whenever sin is addressed in Scripture—whether through teaching or story—it comes to us in the context of God’s unwavering commitment to bring an end to all evil in this world through the finished work of Christ (Revelation 21:3–4). We are praying for and with you as you read. \n\nOne of the most scandalous stories recorded in Scripture involves King David and Bathsheba, the wife of one of his trusted warriors. David’s sexual sin against Bathsheba is condemned by Nathan and confessed by David himself. His blame has never been in question. Often called “an affair,” Bathsheba’s involvement is less than clear, however. Helpfully, Scripture offers valuable context to help us navigate the culture of that time. \n\nScripture records a detail that tells us something important about Bathsheba; she was bathing to cleanse herself after her monthly cycle (2 Samuel 11:4). For women practicing the Jewish faith, this was commanded, to bathe after monthly menstruation. This is important because it tells us that Bathsheba had chosen to obey the commandments of the covenant and honor Yahweh. We know Bathsheba lived protected within the city because David was able to see her bathing on her rooftop from the comfort of his own home. \n\nLet’s take a minute to remind ourselves that this woman wasn’t a character in a story or an actor in a movie.  Bathsheba was a real woman, living in the ancient Near East under the militaristic, political, and cultural control of King David. Bathsheba had real fears, life pressures, and hopeful expectations. Like us, Bathsheba was likely both strong and fearful. Like us, she probably wanted to make a life, build a family, and care for her friends. She likely worried about her future and her reputation. \n\nI imagine Bathsheba never envisioned the turn her life would take. She would lose her first husband and bury her first son with David. Sadly, much of Bathsheba’s story is shaped by what was likely the hardest season of her life, when she was swept up into the center of scandal, shame, and heartache. Though the circumstances may be different, I suspect many of us know this sting. And in the midst of that kind of turmoil, we can all be tempted to wonder things like:\n\nWhere is God?\nWhy has He allowed this to happen?\nCan He redeem even this?\n\nBut Bathsheba’s story wasn’t over. God wasn’t finished working in and through her. Heartache wouldn’t have the last word—not for Bathsheba, and not for you or for me. Mercifully, Scripture records other instances where Bathsheba would help lead, influence, and shape God’s story for His people. Scripture attests to her humility before the Lord and her bravery before King David, as she advocated for her son Solomon take his God-appointed place as king of Israel (1 Kings 1:11–40).\n\nWhere Bathsheba looked forward in faith, we have the unbelievable privilege of looking back in gratitude. Because of Jesus, we can be confident that even the darkest days and the most heart-wrenching circumstances can be redeemed. If the cross brought everlasting life, then nothing in our lives can be so ruinous that God can’t use it for our good and His glory.\n\n",

Though many of the wounds we receive in this life are deeply personal and unimaginably painful, when they appear in God’s Word, we are reminded that He sees them. Whenever sin is addressed in Scripture—whether through teaching or story—it comes to us in the context of God’s unwavering commitment to bring an end to all evil in this world through the finished work of Christ (Revelation 21:3-4). We are praying for and with you as you read. \n\nThere are certain stories in Scripture that cause me to blink back tears every time I read them—Abraham leading Isaac up the mountain for sacrifice, Jesus begging God to take the cup from Him in the garden of Gethsemane, and Peter’s denial of Jesus, just to name a few.\n\nTamar’s story causes me to both blink back tears and shake with anger. It’s a difficult story to stomach, and I get more queasy with every verse I read. It brings up memories I’d rather forget and questions of God’s justice that I’d rather not ask: How could God allow something like this to happen to Tamar? She was just an innocent girl. She didn’t deserve this injustice. She didn’t ask for this.\n\nThese are the same sort of questions I ask myself every time another #MeToo story breaks on the news. They are the same questions I ask every time I hear another one of my friends tell a story from a time in their life when someone went a little too far, when an unforeseeable circumstance brought about unbearable pain and trauma. \n\nTamar’s story is not one that you hear preached about on Sunday mornings. It’s not suitable for young ears, and for some, it’s definitely triggering. If the Bible were a movie, Tamar’s story would push it to receive an R rating. But the same thing that’s true of all the stories women and men have brought into light over the last couple of years is also true here: they all have value, and we need to hear them. Tamar’s story is important because God saw fit to include it in His Word.\n\nTamar’s story allows survivors of sexual assault to see themselves in Scripture. It helps them see that they are not alone—that they, like Tamar, did not deserve this injustice. And because we know God’s character, we know that when we cry out morning, noon, and night—when we tear our clothes with grief like Tamar—He hears us (Psalm 55:17). He sees us. He meets us in the midst of our distress, and reminds us that we are His. He promises He will “not leave the guilty unpunished” (Exodus 34:6–7), that He will “[execute] justice for the exploited” (Psalm 146:6–7). \n\nSo although Tamar’s story is so painful we’d often rather forget it happened, we would do well to see her in her pain and recognize that God is still at work. He is still at the center of her story, and He remains at the center of ours as well.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nWe all walk with a limp. Sin has twisted our hearts. It’s warped our lives. Humanity is handicapped by our failed attempts at holiness. I see us in the twisted feet and pitiful heart of Mephibosheth. As he grovels before King David and asks, “What is your servant that you take an interest in a dead dog like me?” (2 Samuel 9:8), I hear an echo of David’s own words in Psalm 8:4: “What is a human being that you remember him, a son of man that you look after him?”\n\nWhy would a perfect God love one as broken as I am? I am surely damaged goods. Yet, He does not cast me aside. \n\nThe story of Mephibosheth is a shadow of the sweetness of the Lord. Mephibosheth had a heritage of rebellion. His grandfather Saul ran from the law of the Lord in more ways than I have the keystrokes to recount, before dying in shame surrounded by his enemies. Disgrace might have seemed a fitting end to Mephibosheth’s story. Yet, he received grace instead. Plucked from the mire, he was given a seat at the king’s table. It’s a story that should ring some bells. Though we deserve darkness, we are welcome to pull up a chair to the table of the King of kings. \n\n“Let us be glad, rejoice, and give him glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his bride has prepared herself.”\n-Revelation 19:7\n\nCrippled by the sins of his ancestors, and surely humbled by his own, Mephibosheth was the recipient of the king’s extravagant kindness. Instead of the poster child for brokenness, he became the poster child for grace. \n\nFast forward to the book of Acts. The world is being transformed in the wake of the gospel’s tide, when Peter and John encounter another broken man. Lame since birth, he lies daily at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, begging for scraps of mercy. Yet, he receives so much more. Peter says to him: “I don’t have silver or gold, but what I do have, I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!” (Acts 3:6).\n\nAnd he does. He jumps up. He starts to walk. He enters the temple. He is “walking, leaping, and praising God” (vv.8–9). \n\nThe people recognize him.They are filled with awe. They are astonished at what had happened to the beggar before the Beautiful Gate (v.10).\n\nFrom outcast to insider… From broken to made whole… From lame to leaping… \n\nThis is our story. This is our song. May the world be filled with wonder before our great God. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nI have asked for many things in my life—a home, children, a spouse, a car that doesn’t break down, financial means to pay off my school loans, good friends, a few acres in the country. God has given me a few of these blessings, and some He still has not and might not ever. But it is rare for me to ask God for the intangible things. I like measurable. I like quantifiable. It’s difficult to measure wisdom or quantify humility or capture joy long enough to know it’s real. What’s more, the means to come by those qualities are often difficult and wrought with pain, and I don’t like pain. \n\nGod sometimes gives His people tangible gifts in an instant. It only took me three seconds to meet my husband. Two seconds to sign my name on a contract to buy our home. One second to click, “Pay in full,” on my student loans. \n\nThe gift of wisdom, though? Not so much. Wisdom takes a lifetime. \n\nBut not for Solomon. Solomon asked for wisdom, and Scripture says God gave it to him, right then and there. He told Solomon, “I will therefore do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has never been anyone like you before and never will be again” (1 Kings 3:12). For most of us, those qualities take a lifetime to develop and hone, but because Solomon’s heart desired the right thing—to please and honor God by living with wisdom and understanding—God gave it to him. \n\nThere is a kind of wisdom that is not of God; James calls it “earthly, unspiritual, demonic. For where there is envy and selfish ambition, there is disorder and every evil practice” (James 3:15–16). I often find that my desire for what I think is a good, tangible blessing often brings disorder to my affections. It seems that as soon as I get “the thing,” I forget the Giver of every good thing. But there is another kind of wisdom, the kind Solomon sought: \n\n“Wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant,  full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without pretense.  And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who cultivate peace” (vv.17–18).\n\nWould things we long for change if we first asked for wisdom from above, trusting God to meet our truest needs with a gift that cannot be quantified? Solomon’s desire for riches or houses were rightly ordered under his desire for wisdom. God honored that desire and gave it to him, and I want to be like that too.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Ahab and Jezebel",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nFor my grandma, the word “Jezebel” was synonymous with “worldly woman.” And grandma simply did not broach subjects like drinkin’ or card playin’ or movie-house goin’—no ma’am. So much of what we now allow as acceptable would have fit under her “Jezebel” heading. It’s pretty awkward to call anybody worldly, and much easier to just stand back and let “you do you.” In fact, there is a contemporary trend to even view Jezebel herself as an empowered modern women—to classify the queen of idolatry as a savvy and sassy businesswoman. How did we get so far from the truth? Is it possible my grandma was right after all?\n\nJezebel’s husband was Ahab, a notoriously evil king whose wickedness is largely attributed to Jezebel. Scripture says Ahab “devoted himself to do what was evil in the LORD’s sight, because his wife Jezebel incited him” (1 Kings 21:25). Instead of devoting themselves to do good, they set the compass one-hundred and eighty degrees in the other direction and actively sought to do evil. Theirs is a pretty condemnable legacy.\n\nYet how was Jezebel seen in her own day? If she was like Ahab, she was an able administrator and politician. She was a strong female leader who got things done. Her political marriage to Ahab brought with it an alliance to the mercantilist strength of the Phoenicians. She was a woman of her time and of her culture, and she brought her religious beliefs with her into Israel.\n\nHer devotion to Baal was a culturally normal thing to do. Baal was a god who was worshipped through music, dance, partying and debauchery, and sexual promiscuity. In return, Baal promised agricultural, social, and economic success. In contrast to the moral standards of the God of Israel, Baal made an easy appeal to man’s basest inclinations.\n\nBut Christ warns us about this very danger: “Be on your guard against false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravaging wolves” (Matthew 7:15). We know that not all leaders are trustworthy, and we know that not all success is measured in money and power. God calls us to measure our success not by the world’s standards, but by the standards of His kingdom.\n\nOn our own, we all have Jezebel hearts, offering up the sacrifices of our own choice, hoping to barter a deal for worldly success from the higher powers. The applause of the world is a deceiver. But God is not like Baal. He is holy, and He does not exchange His favor for anything we can give to Him. He is not like the gods of this world. He judges the world concerning two things: righteousness and wickedness. And this righteousness, which alone can please Him, is not native to us. It runs counter to every strain of the fallen human heart. To truly please God, to truly have His favor, we must rest wholly in the righteousness of Christ.\n\nAt the end of Jezebel’s life, she was confronted by Jehu, whom God had anointed to drive out wickedness from the land. Though Jehu was far from righteous, he nonetheless reminds us of the true anointed One, Jesus, whom God sent to earth to put an end to wickedness.\n\nWhile I do allow card playin’ and movie watchin’ in my own home, I think my grandma was on the right track about Jezebel. Run from those who seek evil. Don’t reclassify evil as empowerment. Evil will always be evil. May God be gracious to us and purify us from worldliness. May He transform us into the image of His Son, who alone is our righteousness.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nYou’re probably familiar with Robert Frost’s poem “The Road Not Taken,” which ends with these infamous lines: “Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— / I took the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the difference” (18–20).\n\nIt’s a work I’ve always loved, but I also have a few follow-up questions for Mr. Frost, like “Would you still feel the same way if the path less traveled had ended in a ditch?” and “If you’d gotten lost, wouldn’t you wish you’d taken the one more traveled by?”\n\nI don’t know the answers to either question, but I do know that decision-making is hard. For every road not taken, there’s a path we regret choosing, or a journey we still long to take. And it’s mostly because, like Frost says, our choices really do make all the difference. (No pressure, right?)\n\nAs they gathered at Mount Carmel, Elijah asked the people of Israel to make a choice between God and Baal: “How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him. But if Baal, follow him” (1 Kings 18:21).\n\nLet’s take a step back here for a moment and remind ourselves that we have the unique privilege of holding the Old and New Testaments together as the true story of redemption. The Israelites did not. So while it may be tempting to focus on Elijah’s obedience or the Baal prophets’ doubt, there’s a much larger story at play here. \n\nFirst, God gives us what we need to trust in Him. The Israelites didn’t need more research, proof, or signs; God had provided a means of knowing Him, and they just had to believe. Although, as decision makers, we are indecisive and imperfect, God is steady and perfect. He does not wrestle with or question His own decision making. He stays true to His character, and He is always on the side of both justice and love.\n\nThings get a little intense in the test between God and Baal, but when Baal’s people call his name only to receive no response, it’s clear that God is the one true God. He answers not only with a display of power, but with an invitation for His people to return to Him. He is always calling His children back home. And regardless of whether we choose the path less or frequently traveled, we can rest assured we will not be choosing alone. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nI am currently in a group text with some women who are trying (and failing) to help our friend name her fourth baby. The child is a boy, and while the list of possible names keeps growing longer—(Theo… Patrick… What about Finn?)—the reasons why she can’t choose those names keep coming too. (I like it but my neighbor used it… I don’t want him to be called “Pat”… It just doesn’t “feel right,” you know?)\n\nI don’t blame her for taking her time. Choosing a name for another human being is a sacred task and shouldn’t be taken lightly. We know this because throughout Scripture, God changes the names of His people to reflect His love and call on their lives. He gave Simon a new name, “Peter.” From that point forward, every time someone spoke his new name, Peter had the opportunity to remember that though his faith was at times shaky, Jesus had called him “the rock” on which His church would be built (Matthew 16:18). \n\nIn today’s reading, God’s tells a man named Hosea to go and marry a promiscuous woman. The call on Hosea’s life is to offer the same compassion, acceptance, and love to an undeserving woman that God has offered to His people. He chooses Gomer, and begins to create a life with her and have children with her. It’s a hard assignment, one that leaves Hosea and his children ostracized and exposed. The children are given cursed names, such as “No Compassion” and “Not My People.” \n\nCan you imagine? Everywhere these children went, they would have been reminded of their family shame and their mother’s sin. But our generous God is in the name-changing business because He is also in the life-changing business. In His economy, those who were called “not my people” can now be called “children of God.” He is the God who turns our curses into blessings.\n\nWhat name do you call yourself today? Here are a few of the names I call myself: “Not Successful” and “Not Capable,” “Excluded” and “Unwanted.” But God, through the work of Jesus Christ, invites me to shed the curse of those names and embrace the truth of His love and acceptance. My identity is now shaped by His love for me. I am His, and He calls me His “daughter.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nIn December 2015, a group of archeologists led by Dr. Eliat Mazar announced that they had found a bulla in an excavation site near the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. The bulla, a clay seal stamped with Hebrew characters, had belonged to King Hezekiah, a good king of Judah who reigned in the 7th and 8th centuries BC. I know very, very little about biblical archeology, but when I found dozens of old news articles about this little 1/2” clay circle, I thought it was pretty cool. \n\nHezekiah was a real person. He lived in a real palace, was served by the real prophet Isaiah, and he prayed real prayers to our real God. And almost three thousand years later, utilizing a method called “wet sifting” (an archeological process using mesh trays flooded with water), someone discovered an impression in clay made by King Hezekiah’s royal seal. \n\nThe two prayers from today’s reading in 2 Kings and Isaiah reveal much about Hezekiah’s character, and his real, flesh-and-bone existence. But they also reveal his utter dependence upon a very real God. In his first prayer, Hezekiah cried out before the Lord when he heard that King Sennacherib of Assyria had mocked God and threatened the kingdom of Judah (2 Kings 19:14–19; Isaiah 37:14–20). Hezekiah’s second prayer came after he’d become very sick and was told he would die. He wept and prayed, asking the Lord to deliver him from his illness (Isaiah 38). \n\nTwice, Hezekiah prayed for God’s deliverance, and twice God delivered him; Sennacherib was defeated, and Hezekiah was healed. His third prayer is a poem of reflection about his experience of being so near imminent death, about feeling the brittleness of his bones and the fragility of his flesh:\n\n“I waited patiently till dawn, but like a lion he broke all my bones; day and night you made an end of me. I cried like a swift or thrush, I moaned like a mourning dove. My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens. I am being threatened; Lord, come to my aid!” – Isaiah 38:13–14 (NIV)\n\nIn reflecting upon his own emotional state while facing death, Hezekiah conceded, “Indeed it was for my own well-being that I had such intense bitterness” (v.17). In the face of death and destruction, both external (at the hands of Sennacherib) and internal (because of his own illness), Hezekiah trusted in, relied upon, and sought the favor of the immortal, all-powerful, very real God. \n\nSo often, I try to find my security and safety in the physical, but Hezekiah’s story—his real, lived, embodied, true story—reminds me that whatever I face in life or death, I can rely on the same immortal, all-powerful God. This is a God for whom evidence cannot be sifted out of trays doused in water, but a God who has proven Himself to be real, time and time again through His Word, His faithfulness, His miraculous work, and by His Son. A God who so loved us that He came to earth, flesh and blood, incarnate and holy, real, to prove that love. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nEvery time I fly and I hear the phrase, “Please make sure your oxygen mask is secure before helping anyone else,” I wonder how it would feel to be a parent, desperate to put a mask on their child to the detriment of their own life. But I see the temptation exists for us everywhere: to give before we’ve received, to pour out before we’ve been poured into. And worse, it’s a part of Christian culture to do so. We laud service and eschew Sabbath. We exalt work and neglect rest. We praise doers and overlooker hearers. We try to feed others before we’ve been fed ourselves. We are in a crisis of care in many spheres of life today. No matter our vocation, it can be tempting to pour out before we allow ourselves to truly be cared for, poured into, and ministered to by the Word of God. \n\nThis was the climate into which the prophet Ezekiel was speaking. In today’s passage, the Lord appears to Ezekiel and, essentially, says, “Eat my words and then go speak them to others” (Ezekiel 2:8, my paraphrase). God’s people were in exile, going about their duties, beginning and ending each day exactly the same, the monotony unending. Ezekiel’s vision was intended to interrupt their trance of sameness, to give them a picture and a promise of something better. \n\nBut Ezekiel would have been unable to rightly or compellingly convince anyone of anything better if he had not first eaten, chewed on, swallowed, and subsisted on the Word of God. He had to be fed before he could feed others. He had to put on the oxygen mask of God’s message before he could put it on others. \n\nIn the same way, the world is asking us to fill spaces, to show up, be something, be everything, speak something, say anything, do something, do everything, but we often feel like walking air-pockets, void of anything of substance inside us. Have you been there? I know I have. The Word of God is food for us, just as it was for Ezekiel. And our food is to do the will of God, just as it was for Jesus (John 4:34). We are called to breathe in what He has given us in His Word, and then to go and speak it to everyone we know. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nSocrates famously declared, “I am wise because I know that I know nothing.” There is certainly a kind of paradoxical wisdom in his statement that is admirable, but it is still only the wisdom of men. It is the same kind of wisdom we see displayed by the Chaldean wise men who advised Nebuchadnezzar. They knew that they knew nothing. They could not penetrate the deep mysteries of unremembered dreams. This was the realm of the gods alone, those who did not dwell with men (Daniel 2:11).\n\nBut the wisdom of God is higher than the wisdom of men, and in Daniel we see a wisdom that far surpasses that of Socrates. It’s in a whole different category. The wisdom of Daniel is this: he knew that true wisdom is from God alone, the Creator of heaven and earth. Furthermore, he knew that the one true God was not like the gods of the Chaldeans, gods who were neither all-knowing nor all-powerful. Daniel knew that he served a God who was both of those things, yet also near to His people. \n\nWhile living in exile, Daniel and his friends understood that they dwelt in a land of deep darkness, a land of idolatry, harsh kings, and the threat of death. But their security was not in a king’s decrees, or the wisdom of the Chaldeans. They found security bowing on their knees before the God of all wisdom and power. He was their true Lord and King, and in serving Him, they did not need to fear the whims of man (v.20–21).\n\nIn a remarkable turn of providence, the very lives of the wise men of the world are preserved by the intercession of Daniel (v.24). Like Christ’s parable of the mustard seed (Matthew 13:31–32), where even the birds of the air find rest in the branches, so also the providence of God is the foundation upon which even the kingdoms of the earth must rely, for even they belong to Him.\n\nI find that I’m constantly inundated with the seeming wisdom of the world, but it is a wisdom that falls far short of the kingdom of God. The promise that Daniel foretold in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream is one that is even now being fulfilled: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign forever and ever” (Revelation 11:15). In light of such revelation, we, too, may have confidence as we approach the throne of grace, knowing that we serve a God who is not far off, but has drawn near to us, even taking on flesh and dwelling with us. This God, this Christ, is the true King of kings.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nEven if not, He is still good. I’ve seen that phrase all over the Internet, on Pinterest boards, college dorm room walls, and coffee mugs—used time and time again to remind us that God is still good in the midst of trials and pain and suffering. \n\nA few weeks ago, I had a really painful situation occur with one of the people I love most, and I almost lost them. I felt completely betrayed. As a result, I lost a lot of trust in that person. And it occurred to me that I have no idea how people survive the painful situations in their lives if they do not believe in God.\n\nI don’t believe in the prosperity gospel, the lie that tells us if we believe in God enough and work hard enough to somehow live lives worthy of His love, then He will lavish upon us riches and good fortune. But I do believe that every good and perfect gift comes from God (James 1:17), and that God’s good plan ultimately ends in the restoration of His kingdom and eternal life spent in worship of the Creator God (Revelation 21–22).\n\nBut is God still good when everything stable, everything you thought you knew, is ripped out from under you? Or when your boyfriend breaks your heart? Is He good when your grandmother gets cancer? Is God still good when the plans you had for your life fall apart right in front of you?\n\nYes. He is.\n\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were really good examples of living out that Pinterest-worthy saying: Even if not, He is still good. They trusted in God so fiercely that they agreed to be put in a fiery furnace to prove their heartfelt belief. They risked their lives for their faith by refusing to bow before anyone or anything but God. In doing so, they brought Him glory. And when pushed on the matter by the king, they simply said, “Even if [our God] does not rescue us, we want you as king to know that we will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up” (Daniel 3:18).\n\nTheir faith in God’s provision and protection was so strong that they were willing to walk into the fire, believing that He would save them. And they were confident in their decision because of their dedication to their God—even if He chose not to rescue them from the fire. \n\nThe same is true for us. No matter the circumstances that come our way, when we walk through the pain and trials of life, this truth remains: we are still His, and He is still ours (Isaiah 43:2). And He is still good.\n\nThe end result for these three men? A king convinced of the goodness of God and a whole empire of people now told to worship Him, instead of the false gods and idols of their past. All because of the faith of three men and their willingness to say, “Even if not, He is still good.”\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Esther",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nEsther’s bravery was a provision of God’s gracious and eternal plan. Esther had the privilege of being part of the story of Israel’s rescue. But it’s unlikely that she wanted to be anywhere near the king’s harem—she probably would have preferred to stay safely at home.\n\nAnd when calamity threatened, her cousin Mordecai prefaced his exhortation to Esther with this profound observation: “If you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jewish people from another place” (Esther 4:14).\n\nMordecai understood that the real story doesn’t depend on us, but upon God, who always accomplishes His will. Only in light of this truth can we understand what it means to live rightly in the time and place God has put us. Mordecai’s words to Esther provide three profound implications:\n\nFirst, it conveys an unwavering trust in God’s providence. Mordecai was not in doubt as to Who was Israel’s security and hope. It was not Esther. It was not himself. It was not man or the strength of men. He knew that God is faithful, that He keeps His covenant, that He alone is the preserver of His people. God alone can save.\n\nSecond, it is a reminder that God calls us to humility. When we find ourselves in a position either of pressure or of prominence, both are God’s doing, and both are for the glory of His kingdom. Mordecai mourned and repented in the public square, openly confessing His dependence on God. His call to Esther was to do the same with her position of privilege: not to use it for her own preservation or security, but to lay it at the feet of God, to yield it up to the purposes of His kingdom.\n\nThird, it frames a biblical perspective of time and history. The phrase “for such a time as this” brings to mind all of the moments when God’s unseen hand is at work in the Esther narrative. The primary action of the story is not dependent upon what people decide to do, but on what “happens,” or rather, what Providence decrees. The story moves on a series of passive verbs, indicating a divine will that guides all things. “For such a time as this” is a reminder that both the evil of the day and the opportunity to stand for justice were provisions of God’s hand. God is at work, and He works all things—even the evil that men do—for the glory of His kingdom and the good of His people. \n\nThis hope is ultimately fulfilled in Christ. The true rescue of captive Israel is foreshadowed in Esther, but accomplished in the work of Jesus’s sacrifice. He is the true Savior of Israel. He stood before the rulers and judges of the world and obeyed even to the point of death on the cross. He took upon Himself the gallows punishment so that we might be redeemed. He fought the battle for us in order to give us victory. His eternal decree has overturned the decrees of kings and rulers, of powers and principalities, and He has established a kingdom that endures and confounds the powers of this world. \n\nThis is not a story about the bravery of Esther or the wisdom of Mordecai. It is a story about the sovereign providence of God. We are all born for such a time as this, and we can depend on Christ to fulfill His promises.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 4:23-7:29\n\nCan you think back to a moment when your wrong actions or motivations were exposed? When the dark corners of your heart were revealed, and even you stood surprised at the depth of your flaws?\n\nI am remembering a time recently when my sin was laid bare. I failed to consider others before myself, and I acted in a way contrary to what I know to be true. It was not all intentional, but it was all me. I felt embarrassed. I felt sad. I felt distraught at my helplessness to rewind the situation and make it better. \n\nImagine with me a version of this scenario where the one who reveals your wrongdoing also offers the remedy for it. He says to you, “Here is what you’ve done, and here is how it violated God and others. You are deeply flawed. But you are also deeply loved. You are not wholly righteous, but I am. You can not live up to every line of the law, but I have. You are not enough, but I was and I am and I will be—on your behalf. Your life is now hidden in mine.”\n\nIn the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus’ longest recorded sermon and arguably His most well-known, Jesus holds the lives and religion of His hearers up to the light of God’s law. It is as if He takes a spiritual X-ray of their actions, hearts, motives, and rituals, as well as their pain, longings, confusion, and suffering. Reading this sermon should do the same to ours. \n\nThe prognosis is bleak: we are broken beyond self-repair. But the remedy is real: Jesus came to fulfill every inch of the law on our behalf. \n\nMuch to the shock of His listeners, Jesus taught that the kingdom of heaven is utterly unlike our earthly kingdoms. The poor and afflicted—not the powerful and attractive—are called blessed, along with the grieving, the seeking, and the persecuted. The the true measure of a person is not just her action, but her heart. Authentic spirituality is reflected not by how loudly we worship in public, but how earnestly we worship in private. Jesus, in effect, says this: You tout the law even as you break the law, but I alone fulfill the law. I alone am enough. \n\nBecause of the person and work of Christ, the law gives freedom instead of chains, life instead of despair. Rather than dwelling in condemnation or striving in vain for our own righteousness, a proper view of God’s law directs our gaze to Jesus. Seeing God’s law as both holy and wholly fulfilled in Jesus compels us to live out of Christ’s love for us in all areas of life. \n\nAs we read the Sermon on the Mount, we will feel the sting of Christ’s rebuke of sin and self. The dark corners of our hearts will be exposed, and we may wince at what we find there. But we will also hear the invitation to new life. There is peace in relying solely on Christ’s perfection and goodness. There is freedom in living our lives on earth as citizens of our truer, everlasting kingdom: the kingdom of God. \n\nThis is the life we were made for. This is the life that is ours in Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:1-12, Psalm 69:29-33, Isaiah 61:1-3, 1 Timothy 6:11-16\n\nLike many of you, I have spent the last week glued to the news about Hurricane Harvey. I live about two hours west of Houston and have been unable to wrap my mind around the devastation.\n\nI was texting with a Houston friend yesterday, checking in to see how her neighborhood is faring. She and her family are okay, but she knows many who are not. While volunteering at an evacuee shelter, she noticed how exhausted many of the mothers looked. They had been sleeping in large rooms, on cots with multiple kids, babies, and families around. So my friend had the idea to set up a night nursery. She and other volunteers would take the nightshift, watching the small children and babies in one room, so tired moms could sleep in another. \n\nTaking the night shift means nobody will see her volunteering, except for the babies whose diapers she will be changing, who she’ll sing lullabies to and rock to sleep. It is the opposite of glamorous work, but it is the exact definition of kingdom work. Quiet, unseen, faithful. \n\nIn theory, I love the Beatitudes. I love the way Jesus turned expectations upside down when describing who would inherit the kingdom of God and how. In practice, however, I live by a different set of attitudes. \n\nBlessed are the poor in spirit? How about blessed is she who depends on herself for her own needs? She will go far in life, never relying on others.\n\nBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness? How about blessed is she who hungers and thirsts for more social media followers? She will increase her platform.\n\nBlessed are the peacemakers? How about blessed is she who is always right in an argument? She will be called “the winner.” \n\nBlessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake? How about blessed is she who does whatever she can to maintain her comfort? She will be… comfortable. \n\nWhen I really look at my heart, I find these are my true attitudes, the place from which I live my life. I am individualistic, out for my own glory, trying to save face, and hesitant to step outside my own zone of comfort. \n\nThere is nothing like seeing your friend step up to take the night shift during a natural disaster to put your own heart in check. It forces me to ask, What am I seeking? My own glory or His? Who am I looking to for approval? Others or the Father?\n\nJesus entered into our world in an unexpected way. He wore no crown. He had no throne. He simply got to work. He took the night shift. He healed and performed miracles, as the Pharisees looked on and judged. He spoke truth even when His disciples abandoned Him because of it. And He died on a cross as Roman soldiers scoffed at the sign they placed above His head: King of the Jews.\n\nJesus turned it all upside down—the way we thought the King would come and the way we thought we could secure a seat at His table. \n\nWe want to be big fancy warriors standing by His side. But His command to us is to fall back in the ranks and tend to those who have fallen. To kneel down low, as He did for us. To take the night shift and “be glad and rejoice, because [our] reward is great in heaven” (Matthew 5:12). We may never receive a medal or a trophy for our work, but we have already received the greatest reward of them all: eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 49:5-6, Luke 14:25-35, John 9:5, Colossians 4:2-6\n\nSalt and light. Some of us have heard these faith metaphors since childhood, maybe even sung them.\n\nThis little light of mine,\nI’m gonna let it shine.\n\n Christ followers are salt and light to the world. Jesus says so. So why not “let it shine” like the song says? If light dispels darkness, shouldn’t we hold it up as high and bright as we know how? \n\nHide it under a bushel? No!\nI’m gonna let it shine.\n\n“Let your light shine before others,” Jesus says (Matthew 5:16). But a little while later, in this very same sermon, He instructs believers not to flaunt their faith, as the Pharisees were apt to do. Don’t fast so that other people notice; don’t pray loud so that others will hear, He says (Matthew 6:6, 16-18). How then, are we to understand Jesus’ declaration that we are people who should stand out and lend flavor, simply by nature of following Him?\n\nTensions like this are not my favorite. I like to know what is expected of me so I can meet those expectations, or at least do my best to fly under the radar when I don’t. But no matter how many times I reread these verses from Matthew 5, I can’t find where Jesus gives a measurement for how much salt is too much, or a guide for how brightly our light should shine. Even worse, I can’t find a list of practical examples of how to be salt and light in my 21st century American life. \n\nIt sounds silly, but isn’t that too often how we approach Scripture? I confess that I do. I read it looking for me instead of Him. \n\nThe Sermon on the Mount, like all of Jesus’ teaching, offers more than a moral checklist. Jesus addresses the heart behind our action, the motivation behind our direction. His is not a get-it-right gospel of personal achievement, not a formula to memorize. It is relationship. The how-tos are not there because they are not the point: Jesus is the point.\n\nSaltiness and brightness are not qualities that salt and light determine about themselves. They are qualities determined by their Maker. Their purpose is placed within them, not one they muster up. Likewise, being “the salt of the earth” and “the light of the world” is not something we accomplish by sheer will; it is who we are when we are made new in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). \n\n“I will also make you a light for the nations,\nto be my salvation to the ends of the earth.”\n-Isaiah 49:6\n\nIn the same way that salt changes the taste of a meal, or light alters the composition of a room, our redeemed lives in Christ are a way that God, in His good providence, chooses to affect the world around us. We are walking, talking testaments of God’s mercy and grace in a dying world. We are salt and light because He makes us so.\n\nThe art of living and loving in a way that stands out in a fallen world is a matter of knowing and following Jesus. When we are in relationship with Him, the light we shine is His light. The flavor we bring to the world around us tastes distinctly like the hope and joy of His gospel. \n\nAs we read Christ’s words today, may we be drawn less to grand feats of faith and more to the everyday outflow of a life lived in prayer, Scripture, repentance, and obedience to the Lord. May we embrace “the mystery of Christ” that Paul spoke to the Colossians (4:3), and seek Him out in the tensions of our faith. After all, following Jesus is more art, less science. It’s not about following rules; it’s about following Him.\n\n",

I expected that I would go to lots of parties and laugh with lots of boys. Instead, I did Bible quizzing. Do you know what this is? It’s amazing and intense. You basically memorize a book of the Bible and then meet up with other church kids and answer questions. There were even special seats that could sense when you stood up, since we were so quick to answer and the human eye could never have accurately detected who was the first up to “Complete the following verse: ‘Do not think that I have come to abolish…’”\n\nIn a flash I was up, “ThelawortheProphetsIhavenotcometoabolishthembuttofulfillthem!!!”\n\nThe year I quizzed, we memorized the book of Matthew. I was “Captain Bible Quizzing Nerd Pants.” I wish I had the motivation to memorize Scripture with the tenacity I did when I was sixteen. Back then I threw all my teenage energy into bookish and nerdy pursuits.\n\nThis is why the book of Matthew rings with the fervor of sixteen-year-old adrenaline for me. The whole book seemed SO IMPORTANT back then. This passage reminds me that the whole of Scripture is important: not just the parts we obsessed over as teenagers, not just the parts we like, and not just the racy bits in Song of Solomon.\n\nChrist fulfills the whole of Scripture. \n\nSome Jews, weary under the weight of the law, might have wished that Christ would totally abolish it. They, like me, might have wished they could just be free of the law to live as they liked. But the law of the Old Testament provides boundaries and a structure upon which to hang the grace Christ offers in the New Testament. \n\nImagine a playground high on a mountain. Now, try to stay calm, watching the kids climbing and swinging from up above. I know I would keep all my babies as close as possible, not letting them run because of my fear they would fall. Now imagine this mountain playground is surrounded by a sturdy fence. Suddenly there is freedom to play! The boundary gives freedom.\n\nThis is what Christ is saying: the law is excellent, and He fulfills it. If the law is a glass of water, Christ doesn’t pour it out, He fills it up for us. He doesn’t make the law void; He stamps it paid in full!\n\nOn the other hand, the Jews believed that anything belonging to God should be preserved—even the least of the commandments, which incidentally, they reckoned was found in Deuteronomy 22:6-7: If you find a bird’s nest, you can take the baby birds, but leave the mother bird (my paraphrase). These jots and tittles—they were the bread and butter of the Pharisees, the Super Law Followers. \n\nBut Christ does something truly amazing. He calls us to repent of both our sins AND our righteousness. Our “goodness” is not good enough, our righteousness is not righteous enough. Only Christ’s redemption is enough. The Pharisees obeyed the outside of the law, but we are called to obey the inside of the law, the truth, heart, and substance behind it. So go ahead and pay your tithe, but give God your heart.\n\nIt’s only when we realize that even our righteousness isn’t enough, that we can repent and trust ourselves to the righteousness of Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:21-26, Genesis 4:1-16, Exodus 20:13, Psalm 14:1-3, Mark 11:23-25, James 2:8-13, 3:3-6\n\nGrowing up with two brothers meant a constant war of the wills. I wanted to watch Harriet the Spy and they wanted to watch Star Wars. I wanted to do crafts, and they wanted to play video games. It was the usual sibling conflict, but it provided our parents with many teachable moments. \n\nI still remember the awkwardness of learning to apologize. We would mutter “sorry” under our breath, but that didn’t cut it. Our parents would prompt us to say why we were sorry and then ask us to hug one another, no matter how forced it seemed. \n\nYou’d think all that practice at reconciliation would make it easier, but the truth is my first instinct is still to avoid conflict. I would much rather ignore the tension in my relationships and hope it disappears. So when I read Jesus’ words in the Gospel of Matthew, clearly stating we need to address and heal the grievances in our relationships if we are going to be in right relationship with God, I start to sweat a little. \n\nIn Matthew 5:21-26, we read the first of six discourses found in the Sermon on the Mount. Each begins with Jesus saying, “You have heard that it was said… But I tell you…” These six discourses are heavy hitters. Jesus greatly raised the bar of expectation on how His followers are meant to behave in regard to anger, purity, divorce, honesty, generosity, and love. Christ was showing that God requires righteousness that surpassed even that of the scribes and Pharisees. Who can possibly live up to this standard? No person other than Jesus Christ, of course. And so Jesus calls us to aim higher, but also to realize our need for His mercy and grace.\n\nThe new teaching Christ gave on murder said that even anger in the heart would be subject to judgment. While most of us can’t imagine committing murder, who hasn’t been angry or unkind toward another? In realizing that any hate in our heart is worthy of punishment, we can’t stand above the law and pretend we don’t need saving.\n\nWhat seems especially important in this passage is Christ’s command to get right with our brothers and sisters before we make our offering to the Lord. So often we want to ask God for forgiveness and leave it at that. But the Lord cares deeply about our broken relationships here on earth. Just as parents teach their children to apologize to siblings, our heavenly Father teaches us, His children, to reconcile with our brothers and sisters in Christ. \n\nWe are meant to be the family of God to one another, and being a healthy family means lovingly facing the pain, tension, and hurt encountered in true relationship. \n\nIt is the work of the Holy Spirit to reveal to us if “[our] brother or sister has something against [us].” (Perhaps you are thinking of someone now?) We are called to listen to this prompting and “go and be reconciled” as much as we are able. Some relationships may seem impossible to repair, but the Lord calls us to do our best to reconcile. Whether or not our attempts are accepted is not in our control.\n\nHowever difficult or broken our earthly relationships may be, we have the peace and presence of Jesus, just as He promised (John 14:26-27). He pursued us at our worst and gave His life so that we might experience the ultimate reconciliation—peace with God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:27-30, Exodus 20:14,17, Psalm 19:12-14, Jeremiah 17:9, Mark 9:43-48\n\nI became a Pharisee the day I dropped my phone in the toilet.\n\nI didn’t mean to, of course. Months prior, I’d signed my life away with paperwork acknowledging that water damage would not, under any circumstances, be covered by a protection plan. I happily checked the box, certain I would not, under any circumstances, be one of those people—the careless kind.\n\nBut I was. Suddenly, I wasn’t just dipping my toes in the idea of being that kind of person, I was nose-diving into full-fledged, card-carrying membership. To make matters worse, I kept it all a secret, appearing at the mobile phone help desk and looking like a victimized puppy. “What? Water? Never!” I gasped.\n\nAnd then they brought out the lie detector. Well, it was technically a test for water damage, but in this case, it was a ruthless, truth-gauging machine and I was forced to plead guilty.\n\nI didn’t ever think I’d be guilty of adultery, either. After all, I’m just a single twenty-something girl who blushed the whole way through this passage. I grew up in the church, envisioning this commandment from Jesus as the free space on my Salvation Bingo card.\n\nBut, like the Pharisees, I’m prone to forget that the thing God cares about most is our hearts. We don’t have to cheat on a romantic relationship to prove ourselves unfaithful to a faithful God. Sin is just another name for adultery of the heart, which means that most of the bad things we thought we’d never do, we’ve already done. We’re guilty. We’re those people.\n\nMatthew Henry points out that this passage not only forbids the act of adultery, but also the appetite for it and approach to it. He says “convenient opportunity” is the only difference between thinking about eating the forbidden fruit and actually eating it.\n\nSo, what are we supposed to do? Do we hide away from the world? How do we just stop sinning?\n\nThe heart is more deceitful than anything else,\nand incurable—who can understand it?\n-Jeremiah 17:9\n\nAt first glance, the answer we find in God’s Word may seem pretty disturbing. Mark 9 instructs us to cut off our hands and feet and gouge out our eyes when we even begin to think about sin. While it’s gross and painful to think about, Jesus uses this illustration not to punish us, but to show us the depth of sin we’ve been rescued from. He wants us to see that the life He calls us to live is actually impossible to achieve solely by our flesh. His rescue is not a convenience; it is a necessity. Saving our souls should have lost us everything else, but instead, we gain Him. \n\nWith this as Jesus’ standard, we can look to His covenant bride, the Church, with awe and admiration, knowing it has never even crossed His mind to leave her—to leave us. He loves us. He truly loves us.\n\nAll of the good things we knew we could not do, He’s already done. Praise the Lord.\n\n May the words of my mouth\nand the meditation of my heart\nbe acceptable to you,\nLord, my rock and my Redeemer.\n-Psalm 19:14\n\n",

Outdoor summer weddings in the South are the epitome of idealistic thinking. As I enthusiastically fanned us both with a pink fan glued to a wooden stick, I thought about how ridiculous it was for us to be casually, affectionately holding hands at a time like this. Watching the fresh, glorious young bride and her awestruck groom make their vows in earnest to one another, I couldn’t help but think how the whole thing is just completely impossible. \n\nWe fall in love, and that love leads us to make wildly extravagant promises to each other. We promise, in our best clothes and in front of all our aunts and uncles, to “love, honor, and obey as long as we both shall live.” It is the bravest, most ridiculous promise I’ve ever made.\n\nHave I kept my wedding vows? Have you? Truly? Even before we drove off into the sunset I had broken my vows. My heart was full of love, but my soul was still inclined to offer my new husband selfishness and dishonor. We make extravagant promises we cannot keep, but that’s why marriage is a covenant we make first with God, and then with each other. God keeps His promises. He created marriage and designed it to last.\n\nI love marriage. I want to go even further than the Pharisees and say that “what God has joined together, let no man separate” (Matthew 19:6). I want no one to ever get divorced. But this is exactly what the Sermon on the Mount is all about. It’s rubber-meets-the road Christianity. And when the rubber meets the road, sometimes people have to get divorced. When the Pharisees ask about the conditions for divorce, they are, as per usual, trying to see how high they can draw the water line to measure who was right and who was wrong. And Jesus gives them “sexual immorality” as the only possible grounds.\n\nBut the grounds for marriage and the grounds for divorce aren’t to be our chief focus here. Christ Himself is the center of our covenant vows. When the Apostle Paul speaks of marriage, he says, “I am speaking of Christ and the church” (Ephesians 5:32). This means that marriage doesn’t exist apart from Christ. To ignore Christ in any consideration, either of marriage or divorce, is peril and destruction. Whether sin bears its ugly fruit in divorce, or grace intervenes to reconcile, these things must all be laid at the feet of Christ the faithful.\n\nWhether it’s our parents, our siblings, our friends, or our own marriage—divorce has touched all of us in some way. The truth is, marriage doesn’t always work out. Even Moses made provision for divorce (Matthew 19:8). But when the Pharisees asked Jesus about divorce, they were thinking of marriage in strictly human terms; therefore, they also thought of divorce in merely pragmatic, human terms.\n\nThe things we think about at a wedding are exactly the things we should think about at a divorce. Yes, the world is a broken place, and we are broken people. But our brokenness is not the final standard for marriage or divorce. The extravagant promises of a wedding day are secured for us, not in our own strength, but in Christ. Both the making and the keeping of vows are only possible by His sustaining grace. And, knowing His faithfulness, we can have confidence, despite our folly.\n\nAnd that’s why we keep engaging in this impossible mystery of marriage. God made us for love. He gave us marriage to make us holy, and to teach us about Himself. And that’s why we keep doing crazy things like getting married outdoors in the south in the summer. \n\nMarriage isn’t about us. It’s about Him. He is the one who keeps vows.\n\n",

Maybe you should too. \n\nThat visual might make us cringe, but a touch of squeamishness is just what we need to really hear Jesus’ words recorded in Matthew 5:33-37. Sandwiched in the middle of hard-to-digest teachings on divorce and loving our enemies, Jesus calls out our long track record of broken promises. \n\n“Cross my heart. Hope to die. Stick a needle in my eye.” Remember saying that as a kid? As we vowed to be BFFs with our playmates or to tell the truth in a given situation, we may have crossed our hearts with our little fingers, but we didn’t really hope to die. We certainly didn’t expect someone to stick a needle in our eye if the promise was forgotten or broken. \n\nWith all of the conviction our hearts could muster, we made a vow we couldn’t keep. It’s a habit we likely haven’t grown out of entirely, and one that is not new to Christ’s followers. The practical takeaway of this mini-sermon on vows is simple, though certainly not easy. I can’t say it better than Christ, so I won’t attempt to. \n\n“But let your ‘yes’ mean ‘yes,’ and your ‘no’ mean ‘no.’ Anything more than this is from the evil one.”\n-Matthew 5:37\n\nIn a world where words are cheap and promises are disposable, we are called to be promise keepers, a people who faithfully follow through. If we say we will do something, we ought to show up and do it. If we aren’t sure we can, we should ask the Holy Spirit to help us decline or stay quiet. \n\nThere are a zillion practical applications of this truth, but just using these words as a guide to manage our calendars and commitments is the lower-hanging, easy-to-pick fruit. Let’s look up and see the gospel. \n\nThe Old Testament is packed with followers who made dramatic vows to the Lord:\n\n\u2022 Jacob vowed to worship Yahweh and tithe a tenth of his belongings if God would meet his physical needs (Genesis 28:20-22).\n\u2022 Samson’s parents made a vow on his behalf, promising to never cut his hair (Judges 13:5).\n\u2022 Hannah vowed to send her firstborn son to live in the temple if God would give her the baby she longed for (1 Samuel 1:10-11).\n\u2022 Jonah attempted to use a vow to pry open the mouth of the huge fish that swallowed him (Jonah 2:9).\n\u2022 David vowed not to sleep until he built a temple for the ark of the covenant (Psalm 132:2-5).\n\nThe people on this list kept their promises imperfectly or not at all, just like we do. They may have followed through on one specific vow, but each of them failed at keeping their promise to worship God alone and to obey Him perfectly. We’ve followed suit by promising to love, serve, worship, and obey out of one corner of our mouths, while sinning out of the other corner. But we should not get used to this. Breaking promises to God, and to others, should always make us squirm. Even more, it should cause us to repent and look to Jesus.\n\nOur imperfections highlight and point to Christ’s perfection. He is the ultimate and only promise keeper. Despite our trail of broken promises, God has not reneged on His promise to save us and free us from sin, to bring us back into relationship with Him. This is the gospel, isn’t it? \n\nWe can say what we mean and mean what we say because we bear His image. More importantly we can be constantly buoyed by the hope that God will keep every promise He’s ever made to us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:38-42, Exodus 21:23-25, Exodus 22:26-27, Romans 13:1-4, 1 Peter 2:21-23\n\nYou’ve probably felt like a doormat at times. I have too. Worn out, overlooked, stepped on, stepped over, left outside, dirtied, and eventually discarded. I’ve felt it in friendships and in family and in my own home. I’ve felt it in conversations and invitations and misinterpretations. I’ve felt it in my own heart and had it confirmed by others when they didn’t know I could hear. \n\nMy temptation is to stand straighter, hold my head higher, and if I’m honest, to sometimes do it right back. Forget to invite. Overlook. Walk past. Not consider. I want to give like in return for like, an eye for an eye, as Jesus said was the norm in Matthew 5:38. This is a human reaction to a human condition; we’re all trading eyes without ever really seeing anything at all. But Jesus wanted to show us another way: \n\n“If anyone slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. As for the one who wants to sue you and take away your shirt, let him have your coat as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two. Give to the one who asks you, and don’t turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you” (Matthew 5:39-42).\n\nIn other words, don’t trade eyes for eyes, giving like for like; instead, take the exchange out entirely: Give and turn, then let go. Jesus is essentially telling us to turn our palms up, shoulder the weight we’re not meant to carry, and walk on, going with them for an extra mile. We ought to out-give, out-do, out-serve, and in doing so, bring honor and glory to Him. \n\nWe’ve all felt like the doormat, felt the rub of dirty feet across our backs, a by-way for others to step over in their entrance to the feast. But then I think of sweet Jesus, lifting the feet of the disciples—dirty, sore, broken, smelly feet—and washing them with His own hands. The Savior of the world holding the feet of users and walkers and blind men who thought they could see, and washing them, making them clean. \n\nWe are not the Savior. We cannot make clean what is unclean, but we can turn our cheeks, anticipating the sting of a broken person’s hand. We can anticipate the swindler, coming to take us for all we’re worth, and give them everything, saying our worth is wrapped up in Christ and not what we own. We can walk not one mile, but two, knowing it takes longer than a mile to long-suffer with someone, finding in the second mile that we are no longer enemies, but friends. And we can give instead of withhold, forgive instead of demanding repayment. \n\nI know the world may see us as doormats still—used, reused, walked over, and forgotten. But with our eyes fixed on Jesus, rather than on judging others, we will see something far better and more glorious than revenge: Christ, who became nothing, obedient to death, even death on a cross, so that we might walk miles and miles and miles with Him, both in this life and in the next.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Love Your Enemies",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:43-48, Leviticus 19:18, Deuteronomy 6:5, Matthew 22:34-40, Luke 6:36, Romans 12:9-21, 1 John 3:18\n\nIf you don’t have an enemy, you’ve probably never lived in the South during football season. When you declare devotion to a specific team or conference—or in my case, if this affection is delicately handed to you by a long, never-to-be broken-or-else lineage of family fans—you inherit the cheers, the players, the colors, the mascot, and of course, the rivals. You cannot root for one team without rooting against another.\n\nAlthough I did not choose the college my family cheers for, I did choose to root against their rival school, so I could still show up to Thanksgiving dinner without remorse. When it was time for my brother to choose a college, however, he asked me to sit down and brace myself for bad news. Using a poster board and pre-written speech, he told me something I never thought I’d hear from my own flesh and blood: he had chosen to attend our family’s rival school. He had chosen to become my enemy. Suddenly, game days consisted of watching the game in separate rooms and raising a flag above our childhood home which read, “House Divided.”\n\nOther than the fun and games of college football, I try really hard to be liked, and therefore, don’t have many “enemies.” And since I can’t name them, I don’t have to worry about loving them, right? But Jesus doesn’t ask us whether or not we have enemies. He does not give us qualifiers like, “If you have enemies… ” or “During football season…” Rather, He assumes we do have enemies and tells us to love them. \n\nWhat if our reluctance to admit to having enemies is standing in the way of God working through us to bring Him glory? What if our “goodness” and pride are blocking the flow of His true goodness in our relationships? We must stop avoiding the fact that we have enemies and get to the hard, kingdom-building work of loving them.\n\nIn Matthew 5:43-48, Jesus clarifies a way of following Him that goes above and beyond the law:\n\n“You have heard that it was said, Love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven.” -Matthew 5:43-45\n\nGulp. Okay, so maybe I have a few enemies—and not just of the sports variety. But loving my enemies in my own strength looks like the half-hearted lineup at the end of a football field, exchanging handshakes and “good games,” then ducking out to head for the locker room.\n\nBut loving people the way Jesus taught means praying for them, and prayer requires more than a half-hearted intention. Prayer requires truly wanting good for someone else. Because Jesus did not settle for anything less than redemption in His love for us, we must do the same for each other. \n\nI don’t think the point is to love our enemies until they stop being our enemies; I think it’s to experience God doling out grace in equal proportion alongside them in community. This serves as a reminder that if it weren’t for Jesus, we would all be eternal enemies of His and of one another.\n\nThere is no reason to keep score in our relationships. The Victor has already won. This means we no longer count someone else’s gain our loss, or vice versa, because Jesus is ours, and He is all we’ll ever need. \n\nPraise the Lord, our constant companion, for His love. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:1-4, Proverbs 24:12, 1 Corinthians 13:1-3, 2 Thessalonians 1:5-10, 1 John 2:28-29\n\nIn the 1960s, an innovative surgeon began work on a procedure that would separate the right and left hemispheres of the brain in order to stop seizures in patients with epilepsy. They called it the “split brain” surgery. It was a desperate measure—a last resort. The idea was to keep seizures originating on one side of the brain from spreading to the other side. \n\nBut cutting one side of the brain off from the other had some powerful and strange side effects, like one side of the body working independently of the other, not necessarily responsive to the will of the person inhabiting it. Instead of working as a seamless whole, it was as if one side didn’t know the other.\n\nI wonder if this violence to the brain is the only way for the left hand not to know what the right hand is doing. My left and right hands are best friends. When righty donates money to a good cause, lefty is already standing by for the high five. In Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, He is showing us what it really looks like to be a Christian. And when it comes to our own righteousness, He makes it clear that both hands, intertwined, are guilty of selfishness.\n\nEven more than we love to know others, we love to be known. We go to great lengths to make sure people know us, or at least know our good side. This is the problem Jesus was getting at in today’s passage: Have any of us have ever acted purely for the sake of others, with no thought of our own reputation? It’s a terrible thought, when you really parce out your motivation for one specific good action.\n\nPerhaps at our best moments, we have forgotten ourselves, given of ourselves freely, asked nothing in return. But if your heart is like mine, I can still recollect these moments of selfless triumph and try to cash them in for glory after the fact. Even at our best, we act from mixed motives. If we don’t get at least a little recognition, a simple thank you, or a smile in return, we feel slighted. But Jesus says that if we’re getting applause from others, then we already have our reward. He cautions us to humbly give in secret—so much so, that our left hand won’t have any idea what the right hand is doing (Matthew 6:1-3).\n\nThere’s no tally sheet. Our good deeds won’t be weighed against our bad deeds on a shining celestial scale because there’s no scale. There is only Jesus Christ, who writes our names in the book of life (Revelation 20:15; Luke 10:20). The ledger is stamped with Christ’s name, and when my life is counted, His righteousness is the only thing in view.\n\nThis can easily tempt me to clasp my hands behind my head, lean back, accept His grace, and give up worrying about good or bad actions all together. But both extremes of law and grace miss the mark. God is love, and He has filled us up with His love; therefore, our response is now to love in turn. We do good things because it is the only sane response to all the love that has been given to us. We do good things because our hearts are delighted by our heavenly Father. We do good things because we have learned to rejoice in giving rather than getting.\n\nLet your right and your left hand work with diligence at doing what is good and right. Rest in the safety of His atoning love. Pour out the love that He has given you to others, because God is love, and there will always be more.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:5-8, 2 Kings 4:32-37, Isaiah 26:20, Matthew 26:36-46, Mark 1:35-38, Luke 18:9-14\n\nMy copy of C.S. Lewis’ The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe smells like hot asphalt and recess kickball. With grass stains and dog-eared pages, the book was on my third grade required reading list, but my time spent feasting on the adventures of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy was anything but forced. I spent every moment I could nose-deep in its chapters, only looking up from the playground outfield if my name was called out (at least twice), or if my face was hit with a ball (just once).\n\nThe most tattered and beloved pages of that book are in the beginning chapters—before the lion or the witch are even introduced. It’s the wardrobe that got me. Lucy, the youngest, is the first to wander into her uncle’s neglected spare room and open the wardrobe doors, finding the forest dreamland of Narnia just beyond them. One of my favorite lines is easy to miss, because it’s just before she steps foot into the newly discovered world:\n\n“She did not shut [the wardrobe door] properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.”\n\nWe are hesitant to close the door on the world we love, even when an even better one awaits us. Even the most adventurous child is hesitant to explore in secret. But in teaching us how to pray, Jesus says to “go into your private room, shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret” (Matthew 6:6). He instructs us to approach the Lord from a secret place, unlike the hypocrites who stand on the street corners yelling for their Father. Isaac left for a field, Christ retreated to a mountain, Peter went to a rooftop.\n\nWhile this is a great warning against hypocrisy, these actions point us more toward the realm we enter into with prayer than the world we leave behind when we retreat—and it’s way better than Narnia. Prayer is the place where we do our most God-honoring work. Alone with Christ is where we remember that we can trust in Him alone.\n\nIt’s not that our Father doesn’t want others to know we’re talking to Him; it’s that He wants us to know who He is apart from others and the distractions of this world. We must intentionally and physically practice that truth that He is always near—we are never alone. If we don’t make a point to to “go away” from the world and pray, we will miss this. If Lucy had stood outside the wardrobe speculating about the possibility of Narnia, she and her siblings would have been left, as the book describes, “always in winter but never Christmas.”\n\nThe world is loud and familiar, but it does not see us and know us the way Jesus does. He is better, and He waits to meet with us in the secret places of our hearts that are not secret to Him. \n\nHeavenly Father, we confess it is difficult to close the door to a noisy world. But You alone know and offer what we really need. Teach us how to pray when we don’t know where to start. Help us to form words that are vulnerable and true, for they bring You glory. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:9-15, Proverbs 30:8, Luke 11:2-4, James 1:13-15, 1 Peter 1:3-9\n\nIf we stacked the books, commentaries, and sermons that have been written about the Lord’s Prayer together, we might be able to build a bridge long enough to get us to the hillside where Christ first taught us how to pray. Our fascination with this segment of the Sermon on the Mount seems surprisingly obvious: \n\nWe don’t know how to pray. \n\nI’ve been a follower of Christ for more than two decades. By God’s grace, I’ve grown leaps and bounds in my understanding of His Word and my grasp of my role in the Body of Christ. But when it comes to prayer, I still get the feeling that I’m somehow doing it wrong. Turns out, I’m in good company.  \n\nIt was after the Sermon on the Mount that the disciples begged, “Lord, teach us to pray” (Luke 11:1). Jesus patiently repeated the model He’d already given them. Even if we’ve read, meditated on, and listened to commentary about the Lord’s Prayer a zillion times, Jesus’ words remain worth considering. (Take a moment to look at them again now in Matthew 6:9-13.) When my own prayers feel clunky or inefficient, these words of Jesus’ jog my memory about a few things. \n\nFirst, prayer is not solely about me and my desires. It is first and foremost about God and His glory. If we rewind the Sermon on the Mount tapes just a smidge, we see that before Jesus taught us how to pray, He taught us how not to. He warned us not to pray fancy words in the hopes of being applauded by an audience of onlookers (Matthew 6:1-6). Prayer is not a tool we can use to bend the spotlight toward ourselves. Instead, Jesus’ model prayer opens with a list of “yours” that focus on the Father: \n\nHallowed be your name.\nYour kingdom come.\nYour will be done.\n\nMy prayers get off course because too often my heart is postured to think about my reputation, my little kingdom, and how I can convince God that my will needs to be done. But those things don’t get kicked to the curb entirely. The second half of the Lord’s prayer pivots to “us” beautifully. \n\nGive us this day our daily bread.\nForgive us our debts.\nLead us not into temptation.\nDeliver us from evil.\n\nOf the seven petitions given in the Lord’s Prayer, three are about God and four are about us. It’s the order of importance that is worth noting. God first, us second. It’s a pattern we should imitate in how we live, love, and pray. \n\nGoing over the Lord’s Prayer with a fine-toothed comb also reminds me that it’s okay to pray God’s words right back to Him. Many of Jesus’ words in the Lord’s Prayer nod to Old Testament passages and concepts (see 2 Chronicles 20:6; Proverbs 30:8; Psalm 71:4). Surely if the Word became flesh and quoted Himself, we can quote Him too. \n\nSince prayer is a conversation of the heart, the goal is not rote memorization. Isn’t it possible to say the same things over and over and still mean them deeply? I told my husband and children I loved them this morning at the breakfast table. It’s the same script I’ve been reading for years, and I mean it now more than ever. When we don’t know how to pray, we can pray God’s Word, confident it never loses an ounce of its power.\n\nFrom listeners on a hillside, to His disciples, to us, God invites us to lay down pretenses and performance and boldly approach Him through prayer. Lord, teach us to pray? Friends, He already has.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:16-18, 2 Samuel 12:15-23, Psalm 51:16-17, Isaiah 58:1-12, Revelation 19:6-10\n\nOne of my pet peeves is when people in public talk really loudly on purpose. Don’t get me wrong, I like loud and extroverted people in general, but the random strangers who want to be overheard irk me. Have you ever noticed someone talking about their awesome adventures, juicy gossip, or busy schedule, and it feels like they want you to hear every word? To know how cool or important they are? As I write this I’m sitting in a coffee shop next to a mighty loud cell phone talker. Deep breaths.\n\nIn my work as a counselor, I’ve learned about a common human defense called “projecting.” Projecting is essentially when you don’t want to face your own weakness, and so you deny your problems while seeing and disliking them in other people. Pet peeves are often projections. To be honest, I have on occasion noticed myself starting to talk extra loud in public and I hate it. That’s probably why it really bugs me so much in other people, because I’ve felt my own shallow desire to be admired and I’m not proud of that. \n\nThe truth is, most people deeply crave admiration and recognition from others. We want someone to tell us we are cool, perfect, strong, holy, or worthy. Jesus addressed this condition of the human heart in the book of Matthew, when He instructed His followers on how to fast. \n\nWhen Jesus spoke about fasting it was a common practice for Jewish people, but had become quite a show for some. This practice which is meant to humble people before the Lord, instead made them proud in their own self-righteousness. The fasting people made their deeds obvious to all around them by looking visibly disheveled and afflicted. Like the person talking loudly in the coffee shop, they wanted others to notice and affirm their value. \n\nTo the religious people fasting for human recognition, Jesus said, “You have received your reward.” Meaning, “You want human admiration so badly? Then enjoy it. But I know your heart, and you’re not doing this for me.” You see Christ told His followers to hide their fasting because He wanted to keep their intentions pure and their faces turned toward God alone, so they might find their worth and identity in Him.\n\nGod is always concerned with our heart than our sacrifices, and He shows that throughout the Sermon on the Mount. The Lord already knows the motives of our hearts and minds (Jeremiah 17:10)—the good, the bad, and the ugly. There is no sense in putting on a show, and there is no need either, because the Lord is “gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in faithful love” (Psalm 145:8-9). \n\nChrist gave us commands and practices to connect with us, not to put us under another law. As Paul proclaimed in Galatians, “For freedom, Christ set us free. Stand firm then and don’t submit again to a yoke of slavery” (Galatians 5:1). Sometimes that yoke of slavery looks like an insatiable need to have others admire you. But the Lord knows that a true sense of your value can only be found in Him, and so He wants to free you from that devastating rabbit chase.  \n\nWhatever works you are doing for the Lord, make Him your audience of one. And “your father who sees in secret will reward you.” \n\n",

I find it equal parts jarring and comforting. Jarring because so much of what I’ve spent my life building is destined to pass away. Comforting because I have assurance that the laundry that needs folding and the bills that need to be paid and the floors that need mopping won’t be going with me into eternity. (Amen!) \n\nJesus is not anti-treasure. He’s the one who buried diamonds in the caves of Africa and gold in the mountains of Colorado. He also buried a craving for treasure deep inside our hearts. He wants us to be treasure hunters. But the kind of treasure we’re hunting matters. Here, Jesus helps us see that all that shines and glitters must be lumped into one of two categories. Only two. There is no third option. \n\n“Don’t store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal” (Matthew 6:19). \n\nCategory number one is perishable treasure. Anything you’ve ever bought or built with your own two hands is perishable. Your home, your car, your 401K? Perishable, perishable, perishable. Your wardrobe, your appearance, your accolades and attagirls? Those are all perishable too. So much of our lives is destined to make a good bonfire some day. As we picture the ashes, we are tempted to wonder, What’s left?\n\nAnswer: the imperishable. \n\n“But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves don’t break in and steal” (v. 20).\n\nWhat are these heavenly treasures? God’s Word points us to three things that will last forever: the Word of God (Isaiah 40:8), the people of God (John 3:16), and the kingdom of God (Psalm 45:6). Every penny, every second we invest in these things is untouchable, locked away in a heavenly vault. It cannot rot or rust. It cannot be stolen. It can never be taken away. \n\nJesus spoke about money and possessions often, but He never branded them as evil, just perishable. As we keep listening to the Sermon on the Mount we see the real reason we need these frequent reminders. \n\n“For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also” (v. 21). \n\nYou see, it’s not the treasure Christ is concerned about; it’s our hearts. He knows that worshiping our possessions will destroy us (v. 24). Our hearts will begin to rot long before our belongings do. He warns us to “take care and be on [our] guard against all covetousness” (Luke 12:15), not because He is worried we might amass too much treasure. We can’t begin to acquire enough riches to match His. He simply knows the moment is coming when our possessions will go up in smoke. We can buy insurance for our stuff, but Jesus is offering us insurance for our hearts. \n\nGo ahead and buy the new dress you found on sale. Pick out new granite countertops. Keep folding that endless pile of laundry, but know that a day is coming when God will stack all of our belongings together for kindling and strike a match (2 Peter 3:10). As we watch our earthly treasure turn to ashes, may we celebrate our investment in the riches that can never be taken from us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:25-34, Psalm 147:7-11, Philippians 4:4-7, 1 Peter 5:6-11\n\nIt rained hard today, soaking into the summer skin of Texas, the red dirt and rolling hills. I’ve been saying for days I needed to water the Blue Salvias, even though they’re drought-resistant. They are drooping and limp. I brushed past them yesterday and saw small blue bits floating down as I did. It is easy to believe I alone am their savior, their maker. That I must breathe life into them, coddle them into adulthood, water them in the evening, and watch them at noonday when the sun is highest and hottest. But it rained hard today, and their soil is moist and wet, and their leaves shimmer with droplets clinging in earnest. They know they need the water. And they know their true Maker gives what they need.\n\nIn our home we have a saying: We must be faithful to the Word of God and not to an outcome. This is our way of encapsulating what Jesus said in Matthew 6: \n\n“So don’t worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you. Therefore don’t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own” (vv. 31-34).\n\nJesus was essentially saying that, in seeking first the kingdom, things will work out—not necessarily according to our plans, but according to His. When our attention and affection are rightly placed on God, we find that while He might not always give us what we want, He always gives us what we need. \n\nI caught myself in worry this past week, noting it because I am not normally a worrier. I plan, I think, I process, I pray, but rarely do I worry. I know nothing can be added to my life by worrying, but sometimes I think everything will be added to my life by planning, thinking, processing, and even praying. I think I am magician and maker and manipulator, and if I do it all well, I will add to my life and flourish. \n\nBut in doing so, I am deeply deceived. Nothing is added to my life by worrying or spending time fretting about how I think things ought to go. In the end, what is taken from my life is the time I spent on something other than faithfully seeking the kingdom of God. \n\nGod provides what we need, and if we don’t have it, we don’t need it. This is a hard thing to believe and an even harder thing to live out. We are prone to inventing needs: new couches and new houses, new cars, phones, bodies, and attitudes. It’s no wonder we’re also prone to worrying when those perceived needs are not met. We, like the flowers in my gardens, may droop, and we may wilt a little, we may suffer. But “after [we] have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called [us ] to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish [us]” (I Peter 5:10).\n\nToday, the God of all grace has given you all the graces you need because He cares for you. He will Himself restore you, confirm you, strengthen you, and establish you—for His sake and your good.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:1-6, Matthew 13:44-46, Romans 2:1-11, 1 Corinthians 4:1-5, James 5:7-11\n\nWe keep all the candy in a basket in the pantry. The leftover Halloween chocolates, the Easter jelly beans, gourmet candy canes from Christmas, and the Valentine hearts—they all end up in our candy basket. A whole year’s worth of sweets for five children. It’s quite a haul. Some years we just forget about it until it degrades, and I throw it away. Once we pulled it all out and decorated our most extravagantly baroque gingerbread house ever. This year, since the kids are a little older, I’ve been pulling out treats and doling them out for occasional sugar-joy.\n\nSince I don’t trust them to make responsible sugar choices, the kids aren’t allowed to get into the candy themselves. But I am. And I do. Not all of it tempts me. I could go the rest of my life without sour or hard candies. But there are some very grown-up chocolates and cookies that sing a sticky-gooey siren song. It floats out from under the door of the pantry, calling to me. I sneak in and steal a snack. Now, if one of my tender babes stole a treat, I would come down hard on them. I’d start by taking away the candy, then lecturing on the dangers of stealing, followed by the risks of sugar on teeth, and then I’d dole out the consequences.\n\nI’ve got a log in my eye. I think my kids have the problem, but really it’s me. I expect my kids to adhere to a standard that I definitely do not hold myself to. I find myself extending that double standard of judgment readily and easily to other people as well.\n\nHave you ever found yourself saying to your friends, “I can’t even imagine doing what she did”? And while it’s possible that you may never be tempted by that specific sin, you are tempted by your besetting sins. We all have those secret sins that we don’t want anyone to know about. And we all have our personal favorite everyday-variety sins that we brush away. Perhaps we’ve just brushed them away so many times that we cease to even think of them as sins. \n\nIt’s so much easier to focus on the speck in your brother’s eye, or the flaw in your sister’s character. But I’m just looking past the timber lodged in my own eye when I start looking around for everyone else’s sawdust.\n\nHonestly, we love to judge others differently than we judge ourselves. I have reasons, excuses, justifications for my own faults. And that’s it: when we’re talking about me, they are “faults” or “weaknesses”—definitely not sins. Or so I tell myself. But God has shown us more grace than we could ever show anyone else. Knowing this, how can I judge? \n\nThe poet G.M. Hopkins writes:\n\n“Mend first [the] vital candle in close heart’s vault:\nYou there are master, do your own desire;\nWhat hinders? Are you beam-blind, yet to a fault\nin a neighbor deft-handed? Are you that liar[?]”\n\nAre you beam-blind? Do you ignore the guttering of your own candle while criticizing someone else’s flame? Do you, while camped out in utter darkness, judge the dim light of others? Do you admonish others for candy-grabbing, while you actually do the same yourself, in secret?\n\nMay God grant us ears to hear and hearts to receive this rebuke to our hypocrisy. May we not trample such precious pearls of admonition, ignoring our logs. And thanks be to God, that He does not deal with us as our iniquities deserve, but has poured out mercy on us! (Psalm 103:10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:7-12, Proverbs 8:12-21, James 1:5-6, Revelation 3:19-20\n\nMy kids are constantly reminding me of how I behave with my heavenly Father—that is, like a child. It’s so incredibly humbling. \n\nOne such incident occurred a few years back, when we took our kids out for dinner on a Friday night. We were too stuffed for dessert, but when you go to the Cheesecake Factory and don’t order cheesecake, I’m pretty sure a puppy dies or an angel loses its wings. So we ordered a couple of slices to-go, my husband and I secretly planning to make a fun memory with the kids later that night.\n\nIt was already an hour past the kids’ bedtime when we headed home. Even so, as we drove, my oldest, who was seven at the time, grew concerned that his fun evening out with the family was coming to an abrupt end. He fretted and squirmed the whole ride home, even when we told him we had a surprise planned and encouraged him to trust us. But he just couldn’t. He made himself miserable worrying about the cheesecake and bedtime and other things seven-year-olds worry about.\n\nEven if you’re an adult, my guess is you can identify with this, at least a little.  \n\nThe plan was way better than he could have asked or imagined. Bedtime would have been a perfectly practical choice, but Ryan and I had planned to park in our little downtown, find a pretty place to sit, and enjoy a ridiculously late-night cheesecake feast with the kids, by the light of the moon.\n\nIt was a pretty great plan. It was the plan all along. \n\nAny amount of fretting and whining our kids did on the ride home, when they were certain they were going straight to bed, didn’t change what we had planned for them. We wanted to give them a sweet experience—not because of their good behavior, but because they are our children, we delight in them, and we wanted to give them a good gift.\n\n“If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him” (Matthew 7:11).\n\nWe have some pretty big ideas of how our lives should go. We feel strongly about what we don’t want to happen, and we’re perfectly willing to spend our entire lives fretting and fussing, not trusting that God is for us. \n\nOur Father wants to give us bread and fish and moonlit cheesecake picnics. He also wants to give us appropriate bedtimes and vegetables. Jesus knew His disciples were going to need righteousness, purity, unity, wisdom, humility, and more to carry out the work that was coming. And so He’s essentially saying to them, and us, “Just ask! It’s all yours!”\n\nHe has a pretty great plan. It’s been His plan all along.\n\nDo you lack wisdom? Is there something else you need in order to carry out the Father’s work? Do you trust that He will equip you with every supply? \n\nThe Father gives to His children generously and ungrudgingly (James 1:5). So go ahead: Ask. Seek. Knock. “For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened” (Matthew 7:8).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:13-23, Psalm 16:7-11, Matthew 22:1-14, John 10:11-15, John 14:1-6, Romans 2:12-13\n\nI was once the proud owner of my very own pair of scratch ‘n sniff pants. Every time I bring this up, I receive looks as if I’ve been the victim of an unfortunate crime and then asked, “What was the scent? Sweat? Soap? Linen?” (Incidentally, I do think this was a missed opportunity in the ‘90s for laundry detergent companies.) But no, they were purple and smelled like grapes, of course.\n\nAs you can imagine, I was sitting high and walking tall in those bad boys. My friends marveled at the way they really did smell like grapes, and I loved letting people in on the secret. Purple pants were one thing, but grape-scented purple pants gave me a real edge in the fashion world. But it only lasted for so long. It turns out that the fruity fragrance was only guaranteed to last for the first ten washes. And since I wanted to maximize the appearance of my newfound style sense, those ten washes came and went pretty fast.\n\nSo there I was, boasting about the scratch ‘n sniff goodness, only for it to be gone. The worst part? No one believed I ever owned scratch ‘n sniff pants in the first place, and there’s little point to owning purple pants if they don’t smell like grapes. Just smelling like a fruit wasn’t enough; it wasn’t long-lasting, and it definitely wasn’t genuine.\n\nMatthew 7 talks about two kinds of fruits: good and bad. It says once we see a piece of fruit, we’ll know exactly which tree it came from. “A good tree can’t produce bad fruit; neither can a bad tree produce good fruit” (v.18).\n\nBut what if it smells good but looks bad? What if the person putting the sticker on the fruit uses the wrong one? Or, questions we more commonly ask:\n\nWhat if I sometimes sin and sometimes do the right thing?\nWhat if I repent after I do something wrong?\nWhat if I look like I have it all together from the outside, but I’m a mess on the inside?\n\nAll of these questions are rooted in fear:\n\nWhat will God do with me then?\nWill I still get into heaven?\nAm I enough?\n\nFriends, I love a good gray area as much as a pair of purple pants, but nothing about a gray area is eternal. There’s nothing—and no one—standing in “the undecided middle” that will not one day be sorted into good or bad. It will not be enough to just smell or taste like good fruit; we must be fruit grown from the love of God.\n\nBut let’s not be so foolish as to take this passage from the Sermon on the Mount, this lack of middle ground, as a scare tactic. May we always remember that the work has already been done. God separated the world into darkness and light, and Jesus grabbed us by the hand and took us to His side. It is the truest grace that we do not have to live in a gray area. Thanks be to God; we have already entered into the kingdom if we are in Christ Jesus.\n\nMay we smell like His fruit, and serve like His hands, just as we are remembered by His love. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Two Foundations",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:24-29, Psalm 18:1-6, Isaiah 17:10-11, Matthew 25:1-13, 2 Corinthians 3:18, James 2:20-23\n\nSomewhere in Nashville there’s a toddler-sized red and white cowgirl outfit from the 60s, complete with embroidered yellow flowers and white leather fringe. It was given to my daughter by our elderly neighbors, brought out of a wooden chest and handed to my wide-eyed girl when she was about 3 years old. Now, several years later, it circulates among my friends and their own little wide-eyed girls. \n\nCarlton and Joyce were good neighbors, always watching over our small yard from the front porch of their brick cottage across the street. I winced from my own front porch the day the wrecking ball swung with intention and knocked down that empty house. My toddler boys watched in delight and awe as the big, loud machines did their work, but my heart ached. \n\nMy friends lived three decades of life in that house. They raised their girls there, watching their city grow tall around them. They collected snowman figurines and looked out for their neighbors. Then, when most of their life had been lived, they moved on and let the wrecking ball do its worst. \n\nThe thing that strikes me about this short passage in Matthew is not the dichotomy of outcome, but the similarity of process. One house collapses with a crash and one stands strong—the contrast is stark. But the circumstances the two houses endure are remarkably similar. In fact, they are just the same: “The rain fell, the rivers rose, the winds blew and pounded that house” (Matthew 7:25, 27). Similar process, very different outcome. \n\nAll of our earthly houses will one day fall. We’re all honest enough to admit it. We know the things of earth don’t last and we’d do well to store up eternal possessions instead. But how do we do that? How do we build a metaphorical house that literally lasts forever? \n\n“Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock” (Matthew 7:24). \n\nHear Jesus’ words. Act on Jesus’ words. This is how we practically and actually build our house on the rock. \n\nDid your brain just register that last little paragraph as, “Be a good Christian”? If so, you’re not alone. I hear that, too. So let’s slow down and consider it again. \n\nHear Jesus’ words. Act on Jesus’ words. Here are just a handful of them: \n\n\u2022 “Repent and believe the good news!” (Mark 1:15).\n\u2022 “Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28).\n\u2022 “Love one another. Just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another” (John 13:34).\n\u2022 “Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you” (Matthew 7:7).\n\u2022 “The one who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, will have streams of living water flow from deep within him” (John 7:38).\n\nThe words of Christ are life-giving; they are trustworthy and true. We can stake our lives on them. We can build our houses on them. \n\nHis words do not merely impart rules for smart living—tips for a favorable outcome. Jesus’ words impart life and love and salvation. The life Christ gives cannot be washed away by heavy rains, or consumed by the rising tide, or displaced by gale-force winds. His Word is eternal. It cannot become untrue. \n\nSo then, go ahead and build your life. Build houses and meet neighbors and raise wide-eyed girls and boys. Let’s live well this one life we’ve been given, but let’s do so on the only foundation that will last: the gospel of Jesus Christ. For when all our years and efforts and cottages crumble around us, His Word will stand. We are forever secure when our home is found in Him.\n\n",

Her family was so poor that when baby Fanny got a simple eye infection at six weeks old, they were unable to help her, resulting in the loss of her vision before she was even weaned. Still, she grew to be one of the most prolific hymn writers in America. Over the course of her 94 years, Fanny Crosby wrote well over 8,000 gospel songs. Given that she used more than 200 pen names, there may well be many more.\n\nFanny often composed lyrics to music written by friends. She just had a knack for it. But Fanny had standards, and wouldn’t write lyrics to just any old tune. Sometimes musicians would bring music from a saloon song and propose that she sanctify the lyrics. At this proposition, Fanny crossed her dignified ankles and declared, “Oh my, no.” She maintained that the Church must never sing its songs to the melodies of the world.\n\nOne of her dearest musician friends was Phoebe Knapp. And as poor as Fanny was, Phoebe was rich. She was born into the Brooklyn elite, and enjoyed the advantages of great wealth. These two very different women attended the same church and struck up a dear friendship. You could say Fanny’s favorite frolic was the philharmonics at Phoebe’s fancy flat. (But be careful.)\n\nOne afternoon, Phoebe sat at the piano and played a song of her own devising while Fanny listened quietly. As the story goes, when the music ended, Fanny clapped her hands and declared, “Why, that says ‘Blessed Assurance!'” And so the hymn was born.\n\nOur assurance in Christ is indeed blessed.

It lays out the effects of believing in the sacrifice of Jesus, hiding those truths in the hearts of those who sing them. And a great many have. This hymn by Lewis Edgar Jones has appeared in hundreds of hymnals down through the years and is still widely known and sung today.\n\nLewis Jones graduated from the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, then went to work for the Young Men’s Christian Association, better known as the YMCA. Jones wore many hats in his role with the YMCA, including organizing camps for those young men. Hymn writing was something he considered more of a side project. Often writing under pseudonyms, Jones wrote not to gain fame but to serve his campers.\n\nIt was during a camp meeting in Mountain Lake Park, Maryland, that Jones wrote both the lyrics and melody for “There Is Power in the Blood.” The simple song served a simple purpose: to remind the singer that he is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ alone—not by anything he himself does. 5\n\nSince that camp meeting, countless believers, young and old, have sung the song around campfires everywhere, proclaiming the ways the blood of Christ rescues sinners: \n\nIt frees us from the burden of sin and secures our victory over it. \n\nIt works against our pride even as it cleanses us of guilt. \n\nIt purifies us and calls us to praise Jesus for His generous grace.\n\nUsing repetition, rhyme, and imagery, Jones’s song clarifies what it means to trust in Christ. Listen as the refrain unpacks the glorious truth: There’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nThere Is Power in the Blood\n\nby Lewis Edgar Jones\n\nWould you be free from the burden of sin?\n\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\n\nWould you o’er evil a victory win?\n\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nRefrain:\n\nThere is power, power, wonder-working power\n\nIn the blood of the Lamb.\n\nThere is power, power, wonder-working power\n\nIn the precious blood of the Lamb.\n\nWould you be free from your passion and pride?\n\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\n\nCome for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide;\n\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nWould you be whiter, much whiter than snow?\n\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\n\nSin stains are lost in its life-giving flow;\n\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\nWould you do service for Jesus your King?\n\nThere’s power in the blood, power in the blood;\n\nWould you live daily His praises to sing?\n\nThere’s wonderful power in the blood.\n\n",

He stayed on there as a professor, eventually becoming chair of his department and then president of a nearby university. Once the man put himself on a path, he didn’t budge.\n\nTeaching paid the bills, but John’s joyful pursuit was discovering and preserving African American spiritual music. He led the Fisk Jubilee Singers for six years, touring at home and abroad. The Nashville boy got to see the world and share the art of the African American spiritual along the way. In a time when few black men were afforded the luxury of travel, John Jr. performed for Queen Victoria.\n\nIt took three generations of Works men over 70 years of field research, transcription, and publishing to put together a wide collection of African American spirituals which otherwise could have been lost to history. It was in this collection that John Jr. became the first to publish the hymn “Go Tell It on the Mountain.” \n\nThis hymn, like other spirituals of the era, had previously been communicated through singing only. Putting the tune and lyrics down on paper was a way John could give voice to the unknown slave who had composed the song many years before—who, despite his earthly enslavement, sang out with victorious hope. \n\n“Go Tell It on the Mountain” celebrates the good news of the God who makes Himself known to His people, right where they are.\n\nGo Tell It on the Mountain\n\nAdapted by John W.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy John Blase\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 40:4-5, Psalm 107:23-31, Psalm 136:1-26, 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18\n\nNo doubt many things got started in 1892. One of the many was the hymn-writing career of Johnson Oatman, Jr. \n\nHe wrote 5,000 hymns during his lifetime, a handful widely regarded as standards: “Higher Ground,” “No, Not One!,” and “Count Your Many Blessings.” That final example was first published in a songbook for young people. It is considered to be Oatman’s opus. One critic said: “Like a beam of sunlight it has brightened up the dark places of the earth.”\n\nThe Sunday nights of my childhood were spent in church, hemmed in among the waistlines of good Baptists. The feeling was laid back, no strict order of service like the morning. Often the song leader would loosen his tie and ask us for our favorite hymns. We Baptists didn’t bet, but some voice crying out “Count Your Many Blessings” was a sure thing, every time.\n\nOn those easy-like-Sunday evenings, the last half of that hymn’s chorus held a temptation too great for a song leader to resist: congregational participation. He’d always surrender. He would gradually slow us during that high E-flat “Count your blessings,” followed by the descending “name them one by one.” Then he’d bring us up full stop, still as sheep. He’d grin and say, “Now I know one of you has a blessing to count.” A grateful voice would rise, followed by another, and then another. And we would name them, always surprised at what the Lord had done, every time.\n\nCount Your Blessings\n\nby Johnson Oatman, Jr.\n\nWhen upon life’s billows you are tempest tossed,\n\nWhen you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,\n\nCount your many blessings, name them one by one,\n\nAnd it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.\n\nRefrain:\n\nCount your blessings, name them one by one;\n\nCount your blessings, see what God hath done;\n\nCount your blessings, name them one by one;\n\nCount your many blessings, see what God hath done.\n\nAre you ever burdened with a load of care?\n\nDoes the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?\n\nCount your many blessings, ev’ry doubt will fly,\n\nAnd you will be singing as the days go by.\n\nWhen you look at others with their lands and gold,\n\nThink that Christ has promised you His wealth untold;\n\nCount your many blessings, money cannot buy\n\nYour reward in heaven, nor your home on high.\n\nSo, amid the conflict, whether great or small,\n\nDo not be discouraged, God is over all;\n\nCount your many blessings, angels will attend,\n\nHelp and comfort give you to your journey’s end.\n\n",

In fact, it is the start of every new beginning.\n\nOver the next 14 days, we will look at the life of Christ from His resurrection to His ascension. We will make our way from the empty tomb through the end of the four gospels, watching those incredible first encounters and listening in on life-changing conversations. Who did Jesus see? What did He do and say? How did the disciples respond when they saw their risen Lord, and what does it all mean for you and me?\n\nLet’s take a closer look at our Jesus, the one who died for our sins and rose from the grave, who lives so that we might also live.\n\n“Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!”\n-John 1:29b\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: John 20:11-18, Jeremiah 29:13\n\nYou know how it feels when you get to the part of your favorite movie where the main character finally has the epiphany you’ve been waiting for over an hour? Your shoulders tense and you hold your breath; you know what’s about to happen but watching it unfold still makes you lean in a little closer.\n\nThat’s how I feel about these eight verses from the gospel of John. I know the story. I know what Mary Magdalene will find when she looks inside the tomb. I know the identity of the man she supposes to be the gardener. Yet, each time I read the story, I exhale after the same word, every time:\n\n“Mary.”\n\nHe spoke her name. The Son of God, now raised from His own grave, appeared first to a formerly demon-possessed woman named Mary Magdalene (Luke 8:2).\n\nWhy her, do you suppose? Why did Jesus choose Mary Magdalene as the other character in this glorious, theater-worthy scene at the grave? We’re not given the answer, but my heart can’t help but think it is this:\n\nMary was a seeker. She sought after Jesus.\n\nShe saw the stone was rolled away, her Savior missing from the tomb – and she went inside looking for Him anyway.\n\nTwo angels in white greeted her, and a normal person would have run – but Mary went to them weeping, asking for her Lord.\n\nThen another face she did not recognize, perhaps due to her tears, asked why she was sad – and Mary didn’t even answer the question. She jumped right to the seeking.\n\n“Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” (v.15, emphasis mine)\n\nMary was seeking her Lord. She sought Him when He was living, and she sought Him after He died. She sought Him relentlessly, even through the pain and confusion of a freshly broken heart. She did not understand the “why” of what was happening, but she understood this: She needed to find Jesus.\n\nAnd He spoke her name.\nHe saw her, He knew her.\nShe called for Him and He called back to her.\n\nThings would be different between Mary and Jesus now. He was no longer her living Lord, He was her living, risen Lord. Everything had changed – for her, for the disciples, for the world –  and Jesus would leave them to ascend to the Father. I can imagine the love with which He told her she must let Him go (v. 17). But something tells me Mary did not stop seeking after she ran off to tell the others, “I have seen the Lord!” Something tells me she sought Him all the more.\n\nWill we?\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_title": "Great Commissioned Moments",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Debbie Eaton\n\nText: Matthew 28:16-20, Mark 16:14-20\n\nIt was an ordinary day and, as usual, I wandered into my local Starbucks to get my mocha. Behind me was a young man, and I decided to buy him whatever he wanted. At first he refused, but with some encouragement he said yes. It was what followed that took my breath away. I got an impression that I was to tell him that God saw him and loved him.\n\nIn total honestly, I doubted myself and almost moved on to my next activity. But in an instant moment, I turned to him and told him – God sees you, you are known and you are loved. His reaction was tearful and awe-struck as he told me he was desperately wondering if God had forgotten him. As we took a seat at a table, he told me he had been kicked out of his house, was living on pennies and had lost hope in God. We spoke for a few moments and prayed together.\n\nWhy do we live in the tension of worship and doubt that disables us to share the truth of God’s love? (See Matthew 28:17.)\n\nYou and I are commissioned – authorized by God – to “therefore go and make disciples” who will know Him and live for Him. This is a commandment from Jesus.\n\nWe can only do that if we are available and ready for the commissioned moments.\n\nIt starts with how pliable our heart is to choose worship, choose to deepen our spiritual growth and choose to hear the voice of God. Oswald Chambers says it like this: “Yet you cannot make disciples unless you are my disciple.”\n\nWe must be tenacious to align with God’s agenda and not ours. When we align with Him, then we can be freely available for the commissioned moments. This is not easy because our self-centered, busy, chaotic life can hurry us to miss those moments. Our doubt and fear of rejection can have us walk away and ignore when the moments present themselves.\n\nTherefore, we have a minute-by-minute choice to align with God, slow down, trust and believe that the great commission can be lived out at Target, the workplace, school drop-off, athletic fields, grocery stores, the park, a walk with a friend, mission trips to local communities and global nations, in our families, a private conversation on Facebook and, of course, at Starbucks.\n\nJesus said, “I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” (Matthew 28:20)\n\nWhat a promise and encouragement that Jesus is with us always! Now, in His power, let’s forge forward to embrace our commissioned moments and nurture discipleship.\n\nP.S.\n\nI ran into this young man again in Starbucks. His circumstances had not changed, but he lit up when he saw me. We sat down together over a cup of coffee, spoke about God and prayed together again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Hayley Morgan\n\nText: Luke 24:13-32\n\nThis is the first Easter of all time. It is the day when history pivoted and Love won out. But, there was still much sorrow because news of Jesus’s resurrection was slow to travel. When we jump into this piece of Scripture, we’re coming upon two friends (also disciples of Jesus) who are walking to the town of Emmaus, engaged in friendly conversation. They were heartbroken but expectant, waiting for news of certainty that Jesus had indeed risen from his tragic death.\n\nThey came upon a stranger who asked what they were talking about, and those two friends accepted this third man and resumed walking and talking. We are told this third man is in fact Jesus, but at the time the two had no idea. Bible commentator Matthew Henry makes note here that we should be encouraged by the fact that where two gather, Jesus joins (Matthew 18:19-20) and a threefold cord is strong and not easily broken (Ecclesiastes 4:12). We are seeing Scripture worked out in life here, two men in community and Jesus shows up.\n\nJesus not only shows up, but after confirming they are struggling to believe and hold hope, He recounts every Scripture prophesying His coming, dying, and rising. Right there on the road, He tells them just why they should hold out hope and believe.\n\nWhat an amazing experience these men had. They walked with Jesus, learned from Him, stayed with Him for the night, even broke bread with Him. They begged Him to stay longer before they even really knew it was Him.\n\nThe men didn’t yet recognize Him as their beloved Jesus, but later talk about their hearts burning when He was reminding them of the Truth (Luke 24:32). One even says that he had never before been so affected by a conversation.\n\nIs this how we are when we encounter Jesus? Are we encouraged that when we get together with other believers Jesus is also there? When we learn from God, do our hearts burn and are our lives changed?\n\nDo we continue down the road as a different person because we walk with Jesus?\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Luke 24:33-43\n\nHave you ever seen a ghost?\n\nI have, um, definitely not. We live in a very physical world. We, in a way that is different from the ancient and medieval world, think of the physical world as the only part of the world worth mentioning. I mean, how much would you judge me if I told you I had seen a ghost? I’m not saying it’s not possible, but I reckon you would make a mental note to take me less seriously in the future.\n\nI’m with Shakespeare’s Hamlet when he says, “There is more in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in your philosophy.” He means that even if I don’t understand everything with my fancy rational mind, I acknowledge that I am small and there is a spiritual world that I cannot fully comprehend.\n\nSo, when the disciples see Jesus and think: GHOST!, it reminds me how they felt the texture of the spiritual element of the world in a very different way than I do. The ancient mind was more closely tuned to the spiritual; they saw colors, and stars, and water as indicators of spiritual realities. We, instead, see colors as reflected light on the spectrum, stars as gassy balls, and water as H2O.\n\nAnyway, these guys – these spiritual guys who had seen miracles and walked with Jesus, these guys who Jesus had told He was coming back – they were “terrified” (verse 37). And remember that when The Lord appears to folks in the Bible, the first thing He says is often “Do not be afraid!” (Gen 15:1, Matt 14:27). We are simple and focused on the physical, and when humans are confronted with spiritual forces meeting the physical – it’s scary.\n\nJesus is where heaven and earth literally meet.  \n\nIt’s astonishing. It was more than the disciples could handle. It’s more than we can handle.  It’s true and it’s a mystery. Jesus is fully God and fully man. It blows my tiny mind.\n\nBut Jesus tenderly makes provisions for their terror and their doubt and invites them to touch Him and calm their fears. The awesome God-Man loves and cares for us.\n\nHe fully understands both the physical and the spiritual worlds. And He is our bridge and connection. It is a beautiful mystery.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Luke 24:44-49\n\nThe disciples had calmed down a bit by now. They’d eaten some dinner, addressed some doubts. Jesus even ate fish right in front of them so they could see His body was real; He was real.\n\nJesus was back. He’d been killed, He’d been buried, He was dead in a tomb three days, but now He was back. And there He sat, eating and drinking and very much alive.\n\nIt was time. This was the moment Jesus would lift the veil and reveal to them what He’d always known.\n\nHe sat back from his plate and began to speak. If I may paraphrase, it went something like this:\n\nI know the last week has been a little… intense. Me sitting here with all of you must seem completely nuts. But guys – THIS, this is what I’ve been telling you all along. Don’t you see? It’s all happened exactly as the scriptures said it would. The Messiah who would suffer and die and be raised in 3 days? It’s me. It’s always been me. \n\nAnd you are the ones who’ve seen it all. You’ve had a front row seat to everything that’s happened, and now you get to tell the world! You get to tell them about me, about repentance and forgiveness and grace. You get to tell them about Hope.You have the full message now, and I’m charging you – trusting you – to proclaim it.\n\nYou won’t be on your own. My Father said He would send you a Helper, and He will. Wait for Him. Don’t go it alone; that’s not the way it’s meant to be. \n\nSpreading this message is your responsibility, but it is still my Father’s work. Follow His lead.\n\nSister, you and I weren’t sitting around that table but that charge is for us, too – as are the privilege and the promise. The Jesus who spoke to His bewildered friends over plates of broiled fish is the same Jesus who calls to us wherever we are today. You and I are the ones who have seen it happen – hearts and lives restored and spiritual captives set free.\n\nYou and I have been given that same message of repentance and forgiveness to proclaim, that same Hope and that same Help. The charge is for us, too.\n\nWe may not have all our questions answered or our mysteries revealed.\nWe may even be a little freaked out by all we’ve seen and heard.\nBut we sit at the table with the One who knows how all the pieces fit. He always has.\n\n ",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Hayley Morgan\n\nText: John 20:19-23\n\nGod breathed life into man in Genesis (Genesis 2:7). Without God who created us, we would have no life.\n\nSimilarly, Jesus breathed on his disciples and they received the gift of the Holy Spirit, which moves in us and gives us new life (John 6:63).\n\nIt’s this posture of being the created instead of the Creator that allows us to live for Christ. We can do nothing in our own strength; it is the Holy Spirit in us that works and achieves His means. Jesus knew that we would need Peace, and the Holy Spirit is peace. The Holy Spirit brings forth fruits that we could not bear on our own. They are not of flesh, but they are higher than that.\n\nThe fruits the Holy Spirit grows are love, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23). These things can’t be born out of our dead flesh, just like an oak tree can’t grow apples. But, when the Holy Spirit that Christ bestows in this passage dwells in a person, they have the very Spirit of God within them. When we say, “I no longer live but Christ lives in me” (Galatians 2:20), we are deferring to His glory and His power.\n\nIf we yield our flesh, His Holy Spirit will grow new fruit we could never have grown ourselves. This is truly a gift because, like salvation, these are not things we could conjure up on our own. A sinful heart does not seek to be good. A wandering heart cannot make itself faithful.\n\nWhat a gift to be transformed by the Holy Spirit. Jesus is so good to us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: John 20:24-31, Job 19:25\n\n“For I know that my Redeemer lives,\nand at the last he will stand\nupon the earth.”\n- Job 19:25\n\nWe’ve talked about Mary Magdalene. Jesus spoke her name and she believed. And then the two men on the road to Emmaus, their hearts burned within them as the Risen Christ Himself opened the Scriptures to them… and they believed. And now we find ourselves in the upper room, where Jesus sits with his disciples, and our beloved Doubting Thomas boldly proclaims:\n\n“Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.” (John 20:25, ESV)\n\nToday, in the midst of all of the narratives about those who believed and didn’t believe – those who only believed when they touched His hands or clung to His resurrected body, or handled His burial cloths – let’s ask ourselves this:\n\nWhy do WE believe that Christ was raised from the dead?\n\nWe have not seen. Or touched. Or kissed or clung or anything actually, genuinely tangible. We are the blessed ones to whom Christ refers in verse 29, “those who have not yet seen and yet have believed.”\n\nBut why? Why do we follow Christ?\n\nThere’s an old hymn – “He Lives” – that sings in a chorus of emotion:\n\nYou ask me how I know He lives?\nHe lives within my heart!\n\nI’ll be honest, and I hope I don’t offend. That’s just not enough for me. Maybe on a Sunday morning wearing my Easter hat and holding my pew hymnal, but not on a Tuesday night when my world is crashing down, or I’m drowning in doubt, or my head and heart are clouded with temptation.\n\nI’m going to need more than “He lives within my heart.” You, too?\n\nWell girls, I’ve sought counsel (I’m so thankful for my pastor!). I’ve sought the Lord. And I’ve assembled these thoughts which I hope will serve to reassure you in your own faith and draw you back to the place they drew me: Lord, I believe! Hallelujah!\n\nFactually, we have before us a host of recorded eyewitness accounts to the resurrection, the empty tomb, and even Christ’s burial clothes. Facts are good, and helpful, so let’s not forget them.\n\nSecond, we have the disciples’ response. Would these men have committed their lives and ultimately died for a Savior who didn’t raise from the dead himself? The commitment of those closest to Jesus may be the most powerful human evidence to the resurrection. It is impossible to conceive of them dying for something they know was a fraud.\n\nWe have also been given a host of textual evidences of Old and New Testament promises (death + resurrection and otherwise) fulfilled. The Word of God is trustworthy.\n\nWe have the growth of the capital-C Church.\n\nWe have lives changed and the truth that the Gospel is THE story that makes sense of all redemption stories.\n\nAnd the truth is? Christ did not raise from the dead and leave us alone to figure it out. He left His Spirit. And all that God ever needed to say or will need to say has already been said in His Word, and that same Holy Spirit that Jesus literally breathed on the disciples, is with us – literally with us – now to illuminate and reveal those words for us.\n\nYou ask me how I know He lives?\n\nIt’s more than a feeling or an emotion. It’s more than factual bullet points. And it absolutely requires faith. It’s a mystery and yet it’s clear as day.\n\n“To say, ‘I hope so, I trust so’, is comfortable; and there are thousands in the fold of Jesus who hardly ever get much further. But to reach the essence of consolation you must say, ‘I know’. Ifs, buts and perhapses, are sure murderers of peace and comfort… but if I know that Jesus lives for me, then darkness is not dark: even the night is light about me.”\n-C.H. Spurgeon, Morning and Evening\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\n“Christ is often nearer to us than we think he is.”\n-Matthew Henry\n\nThis story of Jesus filling the apostles’ net with fish feels like one of those “normal” miracles (is there such a thing?) that belongs in the thick of Christ’s ministry, back when He was healing the sick and turning water into wine and feeding the five thousand. Instead, we find it here, wedged between the ultimate miracles of His glorious resurrection and magnificent ascension.\n\nWeren’t there more glamorous encounters to tell? Why not a sermon on Most Important Things before Jesus returned to the Father? This story gives us no quotable lines from the Savior of Man – we get very few words from Him at all, actually. Instead, He reveals Himself by what He does. He gives. \n\nHe gives Himself. The disciples did not see Him, but He saw them. He was with them, even when they did not know it, like the Helper who would be with them in spirit, always (Matthew 28:20).\n\nHe gives loving care. He calls them “children” and inquires about their work, as a loving Father would. He is concerned with their concerns, their everyday, their frustrations and their failures as much as their success.\n\nHe gives wisdom. The disciples must have been frustrated and tired as the sun rose on that boat filled with no fish. Their efforts had amounted to nothing. Jesus gave them guidance. He gave them fish. Only with Him was their work fruitful.\n\nHe gives sustenance. The fish were already swimming in the lake that day. The breakfast was already cooking on the coals when they reached the shore. The initiative to provide was the Lord’s, not theirs.\n\nHe gives abundantly. 153 fish – John gives us the exact number. 153 fish in a net that did not break. These minor details are not so minor to folks who fish for a living. His provision was specific and extravagant.\n\nHe gives apart from merit. All of this He gave without their asking, without their making a case for what was needed or a promise to be better – better fishermen, better followers, better people.\n\nThe provision was based on grace.\nIt was based on love and mercy.\nIt was based on the very character of Christ, the risen Savior.\nHe provided in such way that “they knew it was the Lord” (v.12).\n\nHe would leave them soon and there would be much work to do. But in this encounter on the lakeshore, Jesus illustrates that they would not be alone. He would be closer than they think.\n\nLook around your life. Where do you see the risen Christ today? What needs has He fulfilled that you did not anticipate, did not plan for, did not even know to ask for? Where do you see the fingerprints of His grace and lovingkindness? Sister, He is revealing Himself to you even now, in ways only you can recognize.\n\n \n\n",

Do you love me?\nSimon: Yes, you know it.\nJesus: Tend my sheep. Do you love me?\n(Peter is sad)\nPeter: You know all things, you know I love you.\nJesus: Feed my sheep.\n\nWhen I look at it this way, I’m forced to think about the relationship between these two men and the emotional progression of that moment together.\n\nThis restoration of Peter is incredibly tender and personal. Jesus confronts Peter about his sin, and here He seems to be alluding to Peter’s three-time denial on the night before the crucifixion. Jesus doesn’t just skip over sin – He addresses it. This is an uncomfortable moment for Peter. By the second “Do you love me?” Peter starts to really try to reassure Jesus. Peter wants to defend himself to Christ and he is hurt to see that Christ doubts his love.\n\nBut this moment of confrontation and confusion and hurt is Good, because He is Good.\n\nJesus came to restore us, and to restore us fully. He doesn’t want us to hold on to our pet sins and betrayals, but to surrender everything to Him.\n\nIn this beautiful and awkward moment, Jesus firmly guides Peter back to repentance and obedience.\n\nWhen Christ comes to us, He comes for one thing: Christ comes to make us new. He makes us new for His glory! Even in our fearful hesitancy, He is tenderly but irresistibly working to make us what He has called us to be, and He calls us once more, saying, “Follow me.”\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Hayley Morgan\n\nText: Luke 24:50-53\n\nJesus raised His hands to bless the people before He ascended to Heaven. Because of this, the people responded by worshiping in joy. Then, they went back to their homes and blessed God continually.\n\nThis should be our posture of praise. Jesus has blessed us with salvation, and our response ought to be worship. We should be joyfully grateful and in awe, simply because of the work Jesus completed on the cross. Then, we should go back to our regular life and bless God with it. It really is that simple.\n\nThere will be dark days, days when joy feels far away. But, worship is not always sunny and it doesn’t always sound like Contemporary Christian radio. The broken can be holy because it is redeemed. Nothing is wasted or left to rubble in God’s economy, and just knowing that can let in a sliver of light.\n\nIn this miraculous and unlikely event, Jesus’s ascension, we are reminded again that God does not waste death. He makes all things new and works all things together for our good.\n\nThat is worthy of joyful worship, indeed.\n\n",

  "devo_title": "Thy Kingdom Come",
  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 4:23-7:29\n\nCan you think back to a moment when your wrong actions or motivations were exposed? When the dark corners of your heart were revealed, and even you stood surprised at the depth of your flaws?\n\nI am remembering a time recently when my sin was laid bare. I failed to consider others before myself, and I acted in a way contrary to what I know to be true. It was not all intentional, but it was all me. I felt embarrassed. I felt sad. I felt distraught at my helplessness to rewind the situation and make it better. \n\nImagine with me a version of this scenario where the one who reveals your wrongdoing also offers the remedy for it. He says to you, “Here is what you’ve done, and here is how it violated God and others. You are deeply flawed. But you are also deeply loved. You are not wholly righteous, but I am. You can not live up to every line of the law, but I have. You are not enough, but I was and I am and I will be—on your behalf. Your life is now hidden in mine.”\n\nIn the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus’ longest recorded sermon and arguably His most well-known, Jesus holds the lives and religion of His hearers up to the light of God’s law. It is as if He takes a spiritual X-ray of their actions, hearts, motives, and rituals, as well as their pain, longings, confusion, and suffering. Reading this sermon should do the same to ours. \n\nThe prognosis is bleak: we are broken beyond self-repair. But the remedy is real: Jesus came to fulfill every inch of the law on our behalf. \n\nMuch to the shock of His listeners, Jesus taught that the kingdom of heaven is utterly unlike our earthly kingdoms. The poor and afflicted—not the powerful and attractive—are called blessed, along with the grieving, the seeking, and the persecuted. The the true measure of a person is not just her action, but her heart. Authentic spirituality is reflected not by how loudly we worship in public, but how earnestly we worship in private. Jesus, in effect, says this: You tout the law even as you break the law, but I alone fulfill the law. I alone am enough. \n\nBecause of the person and work of Christ, the law gives freedom instead of chains, life instead of despair. Rather than dwelling in condemnation or striving in vain for our own righteousness, a proper view of God’s law directs our gaze to Jesus. Seeing God’s law as both holy and wholly fulfilled in Jesus compels us to live out of Christ’s love for us in all areas of life. \n\nAs we read the Sermon on the Mount, we will feel the sting of Christ’s rebuke of sin and self. The dark corners of our hearts will be exposed, and we may wince at what we find there. But we will also hear the invitation to new life. There is peace in relying solely on Christ’s perfection and goodness. There is freedom in living our lives on earth as citizens of our truer, everlasting kingdom: the kingdom of God. \n\nThis is the life we were made for. This is the life that is ours in Jesus.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:1-12, Psalm 69:29-33, Isaiah 61:1-3, 1 Timothy 6:11-16\n\nLike many of you, I have spent the last week glued to the news about Hurricane Harvey. I live about two hours west of Houston and have been unable to wrap my mind around the devastation.\n\nI was texting with a Houston friend yesterday, checking in to see how her neighborhood is faring. She and her family are okay, but she knows many who are not. While volunteering at an evacuee shelter, she noticed how exhausted many of the mothers looked. They had been sleeping in large rooms, on cots with multiple kids, babies, and families around. So my friend had the idea to set up a night nursery. She and other volunteers would take the nightshift, watching the small children and babies in one room, so tired moms could sleep in another. \n\nTaking the night shift means nobody will see her volunteering, except for the babies whose diapers she will be changing, who she’ll sing lullabies to and rock to sleep. It is the opposite of glamorous work, but it is the exact definition of kingdom work. Quiet, unseen, faithful. \n\nIn theory, I love the Beatitudes. I love the way Jesus turned expectations upside down when describing who would inherit the kingdom of God and how. In practice, however, I live by a different set of attitudes. \n\nBlessed are the poor in spirit? How about blessed is she who depends on herself for her own needs? She will go far in life, never relying on others.\n\nBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness? How about blessed is she who hungers and thirsts for more social media followers? She will increase her platform.\n\nBlessed are the peacemakers? How about blessed is she who is always right in an argument? She will be called “the winner.” \n\nBlessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake? How about blessed is she who does whatever she can to maintain her comfort? She will be… comfortable. \n\nWhen I really look at my heart, I find these are my true attitudes, the place from which I live my life. I am individualistic, out for my own glory, trying to save face, and hesitant to step outside my own zone of comfort. \n\nThere is nothing like seeing your friend step up to take the night shift during a natural disaster to put your own heart in check. It forces me to ask, What am I seeking? My own glory or His? Who am I looking to for approval? Others or the Father?\n\nJesus entered into our world in an unexpected way. He wore no crown. He had no throne. He simply got to work. He took the night shift. He healed and performed miracles, as the Pharisees looked on and judged. He spoke truth even when His disciples abandoned Him because of it. And He died on a cross as Roman soldiers scoffed at the sign they placed above His head: King of the Jews.\n\nJesus turned it all upside down—the way we thought the King would come and the way we thought we could secure a seat at His table. \n\nWe want to be big fancy warriors standing by His side. But His command to us is to fall back in the ranks and tend to those who have fallen. To kneel down low, as He did for us. To take the night shift and “be glad and rejoice, because [our] reward is great in heaven” (Matthew 5:12). We may never receive a medal or a trophy for our work, but we have already received the greatest reward of them all: eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\n",

  "devo_title": "Believers Are Salt and Light",
  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 49:5-6, Luke 14:25-35, John 9:5, Colossians 4:2-6\n\nSalt and light. Some of us have heard these faith metaphors since childhood, maybe even sung them.\n\nThis little light of mine,\nI’m gonna let it shine.\n\n Christ followers are salt and light to the world. Jesus says so. So why not “let it shine” like the song says? If light dispels darkness, shouldn’t we hold it up as high and bright as we know how? \n\nHide it under a bushel? No!\nI’m gonna let it shine.\n\n“Let your light shine before others,” Jesus says (Matthew 5:16). But a little while later, in this very same sermon, He instructs believers not to flaunt their faith, as the Pharisees were apt to do. Don’t fast so that other people notice; don’t pray loud so that others will hear, He says (Matthew 6:6, 16-18). How then, are we to understand Jesus’ declaration that we are people who should stand out and lend flavor, simply by nature of following Him?\n\nTensions like this are not my favorite. I like to know what is expected of me so I can meet those expectations, or at least do my best to fly under the radar when I don’t. But no matter how many times I reread these verses from Matthew 5, I can’t find where Jesus gives a measurement for how much salt is too much, or a guide for how brightly our light should shine. Even worse, I can’t find a list of practical examples of how to be salt and light in my 21st century American life. \n\nIt sounds silly, but isn’t that too often how we approach Scripture? I confess that I do. I read it looking for me instead of Him. \n\nThe Sermon on the Mount, like all of Jesus’ teaching, offers more than a moral checklist. Jesus addresses the heart behind our action, the motivation behind our direction. His is not a get-it-right gospel of personal achievement, not a formula to memorize. It is relationship. The how-tos are not there because they are not the point: Jesus is the point.\n\nSaltiness and brightness are not qualities that salt and light determine about themselves. They are qualities determined by their Maker. Their purpose is placed within them, not one they muster up. Likewise, being “the salt of the earth” and “the light of the world” is not something we accomplish by sheer will; it is who we are when we are made new in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). \n\n“I will also make you a light for the nations,\nto be my salvation to the ends of the earth.”\n-Isaiah 49:6\n\nIn the same way that salt changes the taste of a meal, or light alters the composition of a room, our redeemed lives in Christ are a way that God, in His good providence, chooses to affect the world around us. We are walking, talking testaments of God’s mercy and grace in a dying world. We are salt and light because He makes us so.\n\nThe art of living and loving in a way that stands out in a fallen world is a matter of knowing and following Jesus. When we are in relationship with Him, the light we shine is His light. The flavor we bring to the world around us tastes distinctly like the hope and joy of His gospel. \n\nAs we read Christ’s words today, may we be drawn less to grand feats of faith and more to the everyday outflow of a life lived in prayer, Scripture, repentance, and obedience to the Lord. May we embrace “the mystery of Christ” that Paul spoke to the Colossians (4:3), and seek Him out in the tensions of our faith. After all, following Jesus is more art, less science. It’s not about following rules; it’s about following Him.\n\n",

I expected that I would go to lots of parties and laugh with lots of boys. Instead, I did Bible quizzing. Do you know what this is? It’s amazing and intense. You basically memorize a book of the Bible and then meet up with other church kids and answer questions. There were even special seats that could sense when you stood up, since we were so quick to answer and the human eye could never have accurately detected who was the first up to “Complete the following verse: ‘Do not think that I have come to abolish…’”\n\nIn a flash I was up, “ThelawortheProphetsIhavenotcometoabolishthembuttofulfillthem!!!”\n\nThe year I quizzed, we memorized the book of Matthew. I was “Captain Bible Quizzing Nerd Pants.” I wish I had the motivation to memorize Scripture with the tenacity I did when I was sixteen. Back then I threw all my teenage energy into bookish and nerdy pursuits.\n\nThis is why the book of Matthew rings with the fervor of sixteen-year-old adrenaline for me. The whole book seemed SO IMPORTANT back then. This passage reminds me that the whole of Scripture is important: not just the parts we obsessed over as teenagers, not just the parts we like, and not just the racy bits in Song of Solomon.\n\nChrist fulfills the whole of Scripture. \n\nSome Jews, weary under the weight of the law, might have wished that Christ would totally abolish it. They, like me, might have wished they could just be free of the law to live as they liked. But the law of the Old Testament provides boundaries and a structure upon which to hang the grace Christ offers in the New Testament. \n\nImagine a playground high on a mountain. Now, try to stay calm, watching the kids climbing and swinging from up above. I know I would keep all my babies as close as possible, not letting them run because of my fear they would fall. Now imagine this mountain playground is surrounded by a sturdy fence. Suddenly there is freedom to play! The boundary gives freedom.\n\nThis is what Christ is saying: the law is excellent, and He fulfills it. If the law is a glass of water, Christ doesn’t pour it out, He fills it up for us. He doesn’t make the law void; He stamps it paid in full!\n\nOn the other hand, the Jews believed that anything belonging to God should be preserved—even the least of the commandments, which incidentally, they reckoned was found in Deuteronomy 22:6-7: If you find a bird’s nest, you can take the baby birds, but leave the mother bird (my paraphrase). These jots and tittles—they were the bread and butter of the Pharisees, the Super Law Followers. \n\nBut Christ does something truly amazing. He calls us to repent of both our sins AND our righteousness. Our “goodness” is not good enough, our righteousness is not righteous enough. Only Christ’s redemption is enough. The Pharisees obeyed the outside of the law, but we are called to obey the inside of the law, the truth, heart, and substance behind it. So go ahead and pay your tithe, but give God your heart.\n\nIt’s only when we realize that even our righteousness isn’t enough, that we can repent and trust ourselves to the righteousness of Christ.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:21-26, Genesis 4:1-16, Exodus 20:13, Psalm 14:1-3, Mark 11:23-25, James 2:8-13, 3:3-6\n\nGrowing up with two brothers meant a constant war of the wills. I wanted to watch Harriet the Spy and they wanted to watch Star Wars. I wanted to do crafts, and they wanted to play video games. It was the usual sibling conflict, but it provided our parents with many teachable moments. \n\nI still remember the awkwardness of learning to apologize. We would mutter “sorry” under our breath, but that didn’t cut it. Our parents would prompt us to say why we were sorry and then ask us to hug one another, no matter how forced it seemed. \n\nYou’d think all that practice at reconciliation would make it easier, but the truth is my first instinct is still to avoid conflict. I would much rather ignore the tension in my relationships and hope it disappears. So when I read Jesus’ words in the Gospel of Matthew, clearly stating we need to address and heal the grievances in our relationships if we are going to be in right relationship with God, I start to sweat a little. \n\nIn Matthew 5:21-26, we read the first of six discourses found in the Sermon on the Mount. Each begins with Jesus saying, “You have heard that it was said… But I tell you…” These six discourses are heavy hitters. Jesus greatly raised the bar of expectation on how His followers are meant to behave in regard to anger, purity, divorce, honesty, generosity, and love. Christ was showing that God requires righteousness that surpassed even that of the scribes and Pharisees. Who can possibly live up to this standard? No person other than Jesus Christ, of course. And so Jesus calls us to aim higher, but also to realize our need for His mercy and grace.\n\nThe new teaching Christ gave on murder said that even anger in the heart would be subject to judgment. While most of us can’t imagine committing murder, who hasn’t been angry or unkind toward another? In realizing that any hate in our heart is worthy of punishment, we can’t stand above the law and pretend we don’t need saving.\n\nWhat seems especially important in this passage is Christ’s command to get right with our brothers and sisters before we make our offering to the Lord. So often we want to ask God for forgiveness and leave it at that. But the Lord cares deeply about our broken relationships here on earth. Just as parents teach their children to apologize to siblings, our heavenly Father teaches us, His children, to reconcile with our brothers and sisters in Christ. \n\nWe are meant to be the family of God to one another, and being a healthy family means lovingly facing the pain, tension, and hurt encountered in true relationship. \n\nIt is the work of the Holy Spirit to reveal to us if “[our] brother or sister has something against [us].” (Perhaps you are thinking of someone now?) We are called to listen to this prompting and “go and be reconciled” as much as we are able. Some relationships may seem impossible to repair, but the Lord calls us to do our best to reconcile. Whether or not our attempts are accepted is not in our control.\n\nHowever difficult or broken our earthly relationships may be, we have the peace and presence of Jesus, just as He promised (John 14:26-27). He pursued us at our worst and gave His life so that we might experience the ultimate reconciliation—peace with God.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:27-30, Exodus 20:14,17, Psalm 19:12-14, Jeremiah 17:9, Mark 9:43-48\n\nI became a Pharisee the day I dropped my phone in the toilet.\n\nI didn’t mean to, of course. Months prior, I’d signed my life away with paperwork acknowledging that water damage would not, under any circumstances, be covered by a protection plan. I happily checked the box, certain I would not, under any circumstances, be one of those people—the careless kind.\n\nBut I was. Suddenly, I wasn’t just dipping my toes in the idea of being that kind of person, I was nose-diving into full-fledged, card-carrying membership. To make matters worse, I kept it all a secret, appearing at the mobile phone help desk and looking like a victimized puppy. “What? Water? Never!” I gasped.\n\nAnd then they brought out the lie detector. Well, it was technically a test for water damage, but in this case, it was a ruthless, truth-gauging machine and I was forced to plead guilty.\n\nI didn’t ever think I’d be guilty of adultery, either. After all, I’m just a single twenty-something girl who blushed the whole way through this passage. I grew up in the church, envisioning this commandment from Jesus as the free space on my Salvation Bingo card.\n\nBut, like the Pharisees, I’m prone to forget that the thing God cares about most is our hearts. We don’t have to cheat on a romantic relationship to prove ourselves unfaithful to a faithful God. Sin is just another name for adultery of the heart, which means that most of the bad things we thought we’d never do, we’ve already done. We’re guilty. We’re those people.\n\nMatthew Henry points out that this passage not only forbids the act of adultery, but also the appetite for it and approach to it. He says “convenient opportunity” is the only difference between thinking about eating the forbidden fruit and actually eating it.\n\nSo, what are we supposed to do? Do we hide away from the world? How do we just stop sinning?\n\nThe heart is more deceitful than anything else,\nand incurable—who can understand it?\n-Jeremiah 17:9\n\nAt first glance, the answer we find in God’s Word may seem pretty disturbing. Mark 9 instructs us to cut off our hands and feet and gouge out our eyes when we even begin to think about sin. While it’s gross and painful to think about, Jesus uses this illustration not to punish us, but to show us the depth of sin we’ve been rescued from. He wants us to see that the life He calls us to live is actually impossible to achieve solely by our flesh. His rescue is not a convenience; it is a necessity. Saving our souls should have lost us everything else, but instead, we gain Him. \n\nWith this as Jesus’ standard, we can look to His covenant bride, the Church, with awe and admiration, knowing it has never even crossed His mind to leave her—to leave us. He loves us. He truly loves us.\n\nAll of the good things we knew we could not do, He’s already done. Praise the Lord.\n\n May the words of my mouth\nand the meditation of my heart\nbe acceptable to you,\nLord, my rock and my Redeemer.\n-Psalm 19:14\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:31-32, Genesis 2:20-25, Malachi 2:10-16, Matthew 19:1-12, 1 Corinthians 7:10-16\n\nLast night, my husband and I held hands as guests at a wedding. Outdoor summer weddings in the South are the epitome of idealistic thinking. As I enthusiastically fanned us both with a pink fan glued to a wooden stick, I thought about how ridiculous it was for us to be casually, affectionately holding hands at a time like this. Watching the fresh, glorious young bride and her awestruck groom make their vows in earnest to one another, I couldn’t help but think how the whole thing is just completely impossible. \n\nWe fall in love, and that love leads us to make wildly extravagant promises to each other. We promise, in our best clothes and in front of all our aunts and uncles, to “love, honor, and obey as long as we both shall live.” It is the bravest, most ridiculous promise I’ve ever made.\n\nHave I kept my wedding vows? Have you? Truly? Even before we drove off into the sunset I had broken my vows. My heart was full of love, but my soul was still inclined to offer my new husband selfishness and dishonor. We make extravagant promises we cannot keep, but that’s why marriage is a covenant we make first with God, and then with each other. God keeps His promises. He created marriage and designed it to last.\n\nI love marriage. I want to go even further than the Pharisees and say that “what God has joined together, let no man separate” (Matthew 19:6). I want no one to ever get divorced. But this is exactly what the Sermon on the Mount is all about. It’s rubber-meets-the road Christianity. And when the rubber meets the road, sometimes people have to get divorced. When the Pharisees ask about the conditions for divorce, they are, as per usual, trying to see how high they can draw the water line to measure who was right and who was wrong. And Jesus gives them “sexual immorality” as the only possible grounds.\n\nBut the grounds for marriage and the grounds for divorce aren’t to be our chief focus here. Christ Himself is the center of our covenant vows. When the Apostle Paul speaks of marriage, he says, “I am speaking of Christ and the church” (Ephesians 5:32). This means that marriage doesn’t exist apart from Christ. To ignore Christ in any consideration, either of marriage or divorce, is peril and destruction. Whether sin bears its ugly fruit in divorce, or grace intervenes to reconcile, these things must all be laid at the feet of Christ the faithful.\n\nWhether it’s our parents, our siblings, our friends, or our own marriage—divorce has touched all of us in some way. The truth is, marriage doesn’t always work out. Even Moses made provision for divorce (Matthew 19:8). But when the Pharisees asked Jesus about divorce, they were thinking of marriage in strictly human terms; therefore, they also thought of divorce in merely pragmatic, human terms.\n\nThe things we think about at a wedding are exactly the things we should think about at a divorce. Yes, the world is a broken place, and we are broken people. But our brokenness is not the final standard for marriage or divorce. The extravagant promises of a wedding day are secured for us, not in our own strength, but in Christ. Both the making and the keeping of vows are only possible by His sustaining grace. And, knowing His faithfulness, we can have confidence, despite our folly.\n\nAnd that’s why we keep engaging in this impossible mystery of marriage. God made us for love. He gave us marriage to make us holy, and to teach us about Himself. And that’s why we keep doing crazy things like getting married outdoors in the south in the summer. \n\nMarriage isn’t about us. It’s about Him. He is the one who keeps vows.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:33-37, Exodus 20:7, Ecclesiastes 5:4-7, Matthew 26:62-64, James 5:12\n\nI should be walking around with a needle in my eye. Maybe you should too. \n\nThat visual might make us cringe, but a touch of squeamishness is just what we need to really hear Jesus’ words recorded in Matthew 5:33-37. Sandwiched in the middle of hard-to-digest teachings on divorce and loving our enemies, Jesus calls out our long track record of broken promises. \n\n“Cross my heart. Hope to die. Stick a needle in my eye.” Remember saying that as a kid? As we vowed to be BFFs with our playmates or to tell the truth in a given situation, we may have crossed our hearts with our little fingers, but we didn’t really hope to die. We certainly didn’t expect someone to stick a needle in our eye if the promise was forgotten or broken. \n\nWith all of the conviction our hearts could muster, we made a vow we couldn’t keep. It’s a habit we likely haven’t grown out of entirely, and one that is not new to Christ’s followers. The practical takeaway of this mini-sermon on vows is simple, though certainly not easy. I can’t say it better than Christ, so I won’t attempt to. \n\n“But let your ‘yes’ mean ‘yes,’ and your ‘no’ mean ‘no.’ Anything more than this is from the evil one.”\n-Matthew 5:37\n\nIn a world where words are cheap and promises are disposable, we are called to be promise keepers, a people who faithfully follow through. If we say we will do something, we ought to show up and do it. If we aren’t sure we can, we should ask the Holy Spirit to help us decline or stay quiet. \n\nThere are a zillion practical applications of this truth, but just using these words as a guide to manage our calendars and commitments is the lower-hanging, easy-to-pick fruit. Let’s look up and see the gospel. \n\nThe Old Testament is packed with followers who made dramatic vows to the Lord:\n\nJacob vowed to worship Yahweh and tithe a tenth of his belongings if God would meet his physical needs (Genesis 28:20-22).\n\nSamson’s parents made a vow on his behalf, promising to never cut his hair (Judges 13:5).\n\nHannah vowed to send her firstborn son to live in the temple if God would give her the baby she longed for (1 Samuel 1:10-11).\n\nJonah attempted to use a vow to pry open the mouth of the huge fish that swallowed him (Jonah 2:9).\n\nDavid vowed not to sleep until he built a temple for the ark of the covenant (Psalm 132:2-5).\n\nThe people on this list kept their promises imperfectly or not at all, just like we do. They may have followed through on one specific vow, but each of them failed at keeping their promise to worship God alone and to obey Him perfectly. We’ve followed suit by promising to love, serve, worship, and obey out of one corner of our mouths, while sinning out of the other corner. But we should not get used to this. Breaking promises to God, and to others, should always make us squirm. Even more, it should cause us to repent and look to Jesus.\n\nOur imperfections highlight and point to Christ’s perfection. He is the ultimate and only promise keeper. Despite our trail of broken promises, God has not reneged on His promise to save us and free us from sin, to bring us back into relationship with Him. This is the gospel, isn’t it? \n\nWe can say what we mean and mean what we say because we bear His image. More importantly we can be constantly buoyed by the hope that God will keep every promise He’s ever made to us.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:38-42, Exodus 21:23-25, Exodus 22:26-27, Romans 13:1-4, 1 Peter 2:21-23\n\nYou’ve probably felt like a doormat at times. I have too. Worn out, overlooked, stepped on, stepped over, left outside, dirtied, and eventually discarded. I’ve felt it in friendships and in family and in my own home. I’ve felt it in conversations and invitations and misinterpretations. I’ve felt it in my own heart and had it confirmed by others when they didn’t know I could hear. \n\nMy temptation is to stand straighter, hold my head higher, and if I’m honest, to sometimes do it right back. Forget to invite. Overlook. Walk past. Not consider. I want to give like in return for like, an eye for an eye, as Jesus said was the norm in Matthew 5:38. This is a human reaction to a human condition; we’re all trading eyes without ever really seeing anything at all. But Jesus wanted to show us another way: \n\n“If anyone slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. As for the one who wants to sue you and take away your shirt, let him have your coat as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two. Give to the one who asks you, and don’t turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you” (Matthew 5:39-42).\n\nIn other words, don’t trade eyes for eyes, giving like for like; instead, take the exchange out entirely: Give and turn, then let go. Jesus is essentially telling us to turn our palms up, shoulder the weight we’re not meant to carry, and walk on, going with them for an extra mile. We ought to out-give, out-do, out-serve, and in doing so, bring honor and glory to Him. \n\nWe’ve all felt like the doormat, felt the rub of dirty feet across our backs, a by-way for others to step over in their entrance to the feast. But then I think of sweet Jesus, lifting the feet of the disciples—dirty, sore, broken, smelly feet—and washing them with His own hands. The Savior of the world holding the feet of users and walkers and blind men who thought they could see, and washing them, making them clean. \n\nWe are not the Savior. We cannot make clean what is unclean, but we can turn our cheeks, anticipating the sting of a broken person’s hand. We can anticipate the swindler, coming to take us for all we’re worth, and give them everything, saying our worth is wrapped up in Christ and not what we own. We can walk not one mile, but two, knowing it takes longer than a mile to long-suffer with someone, finding in the second mile that we are no longer enemies, but friends. And we can give instead of withhold, forgive instead of demanding repayment. \n\nI know the world may see us as doormats still—used, reused, walked over, and forgotten. But with our eyes fixed on Jesus, rather than on judging others, we will see something far better and more glorious than revenge: Christ, who became nothing, obedient to death, even death on a cross, so that we might walk miles and miles and miles with Him, both in this life and in the next.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 5:43-48, Leviticus 19:18, Deuteronomy 6:5, Matthew 22:34-40, Luke 6:36, Romans 12:9-21, 1 John 3:18\n\nIf you don’t have an enemy, you’ve probably never lived in the South during football season. When you declare devotion to a specific team or conference—or in my case, if this affection is delicately handed to you by a long, never-to-be broken-or-else lineage of family fans—you inherit the cheers, the players, the colors, the mascot, and of course, the rivals. You cannot root for one team without rooting against another.\n\nAlthough I did not choose the college my family cheers for, I did choose to root against their rival school, so I could still show up to Thanksgiving dinner without remorse. When it was time for my brother to choose a college, however, he asked me to sit down and brace myself for bad news. Using a poster board and pre-written speech, he told me something I never thought I’d hear from my own flesh and blood: he had chosen to attend our family’s rival school. He had chosen to become my enemy. Suddenly, game days consisted of watching the game in separate rooms and raising a flag above our childhood home which read, “House Divided.”\n\nOther than the fun and games of college football, I try really hard to be liked, and therefore, don’t have many “enemies.” And since I can’t name them, I don’t have to worry about loving them, right? But Jesus doesn’t ask us whether or not we have enemies. He does not give us qualifiers like, “If you have enemies… ” or “During football season…” Rather, He assumes we do have enemies and tells us to love them. \n\nWhat if our reluctance to admit to having enemies is standing in the way of God working through us to bring Him glory? What if our “goodness” and pride are blocking the flow of His true goodness in our relationships? We must stop avoiding the fact that we have enemies and get to the hard, kingdom-building work of loving them.\n\nIn Matthew 5:43-48, Jesus clarifies a way of following Him that goes above and beyond the law:\n\n“You have heard that it was said, Love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven.”\n-Matthew 5:43-45\n\nGulp. Okay, so maybe I have a few enemies—and not just of the sports variety. But loving my enemies in my own strength looks like the half-hearted lineup at the end of a football field, exchanging handshakes and “good games,” then ducking out to head for the locker room.\n\nBut loving people the way Jesus taught means praying for them, and prayer requires more than a half-hearted intention. Prayer requires truly wanting good for someone else. Because Jesus did not settle for anything less than redemption in His love for us, we must do the same for each other. \n\nI don’t think the point is to love our enemies until they stop being our enemies; I think it’s to experience God doling out grace in equal proportion alongside them in community. This serves as a reminder that if it weren’t for Jesus, we would all be eternal enemies of His and of one another.\n\nThere is no reason to keep score in our relationships. The Victor has already won. This means we no longer count someone else’s gain our loss, or vice versa, because Jesus is ours, and He is all we’ll ever need. \n\nPraise the Lord, our constant companion, for His love. Amen.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:1-4, Proverbs 24:12, 1 Corinthians 13:1-3, 2 Thessalonians 1:5-10, 1 John 2:28-29\n\nIn the 1960s, an innovative surgeon began work on a procedure that would separate the right and left hemispheres of the brain in order to stop seizures in patients with epilepsy. They called it the “split brain” surgery. It was a desperate measure—a last resort. The idea was to keep seizures originating on one side of the brain from spreading to the other side. \n\nBut cutting one side of the brain off from the other had some powerful and strange side effects, like one side of the body working independently of the other, not necessarily responsive to the will of the person inhabiting it. Instead of working as a seamless whole, it was as if one side didn’t know the other.\n\nI wonder if this violence to the brain is the only way for the left hand not to know what the right hand is doing. My left and right hands are best friends. When righty donates money to a good cause, lefty is already standing by for the high five. In Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, He is showing us what it really looks like to be a Christian. And when it comes to our own righteousness, He makes it clear that both hands, intertwined, are guilty of selfishness.\n\nEven more than we love to know others, we love to be known. We go to great lengths to make sure people know us, or at least know our good side. This is the problem Jesus was getting at in today’s passage: Have any of us have ever acted purely for the sake of others, with no thought of our own reputation? It’s a terrible thought, when you really parce out your motivation for one specific good action.\n\nPerhaps at our best moments, we have forgotten ourselves, given of ourselves freely, asked nothing in return. But if your heart is like mine, I can still recollect these moments of selfless triumph and try to cash them in for glory after the fact. Even at our best, we act from mixed motives. If we don’t get at least a little recognition, a simple thank you, or a smile in return, we feel slighted. But Jesus says that if we’re getting applause from others, then we already have our reward. He cautions us to humbly give in secret—so much so, that our left hand won’t have any idea what the right hand is doing (Matthew 6:1-3).\n\nThere’s no tally sheet. Our good deeds won’t be weighed against our bad deeds on a shining celestial scale because there’s no scale. There is only Jesus Christ, who writes our names in the book of life (Revelation 20:15; Luke 10:20). The ledger is stamped with Christ’s name, and when my life is counted, His righteousness is the only thing in view.\n\nThis can easily tempt me to clasp my hands behind my head, lean back, accept His grace, and give up worrying about good or bad actions all together. But both extremes of law and grace miss the mark. God is love, and He has filled us up with His love; therefore, our response is now to love in turn. We do good things because it is the only sane response to all the love that has been given to us. We do good things because our hearts are delighted by our heavenly Father. We do good things because we have learned to rejoice in giving rather than getting.\n\nLet your right and your left hand work with diligence at doing what is good and right. Rest in the safety of His atoning love. Pour out the love that He has given you to others, because God is love, and there will always be more.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:5-8, 2 Kings 4:32-37, Isaiah 26:20, Matthew 26:36-46, Mark 1:35-38, Luke 18:9-14\n\nMy copy of C.S. Lewis’ The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe smells like hot asphalt and recess kickball. With grass stains and dog-eared pages, the book was on my third grade required reading list, but my time spent feasting on the adventures of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy was anything but forced. I spent every moment I could nose-deep in its chapters, only looking up from the playground outfield if my name was called out (at least twice), or if my face was hit with a ball (just once).\n\nThe most tattered and beloved pages of that book are in the beginning chapters—before the lion or the witch are even introduced. It’s the wardrobe that got me. Lucy, the youngest, is the first to wander into her uncle’s neglected spare room and open the wardrobe doors, finding the forest dreamland of Narnia just beyond them. One of my favorite lines is easy to miss, because it’s just before she steps foot into the newly discovered world:\n\n“She did not shut [the wardrobe door] properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.”\n\nWe are hesitant to close the door on the world we love, even when an even better one awaits us. Even the most adventurous child is hesitant to explore in secret. But in teaching us how to pray, Jesus says to “go into your private room, shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret” (Matthew 6:6). He instructs us to approach the Lord from a secret place, unlike the hypocrites who stand on the street corners yelling for their Father. Isaac left for a field, Christ retreated to a mountain, Peter went to a rooftop.\n\nWhile this is a great warning against hypocrisy, these actions point us more toward the realm we enter into with prayer than the world we leave behind when we retreat—and it’s way better than Narnia. Prayer is the place where we do our most God-honoring work. Alone with Christ is where we remember that we can trust in Him alone.\n\nIt’s not that our Father doesn’t want others to know we’re talking to Him; it’s that He wants us to know who He is apart from others and the distractions of this world. We must intentionally and physically practice that truth that He is always near—we are never alone. If we don’t make a point to to “go away” from the world and pray, we will miss this. If Lucy had stood outside the wardrobe speculating about the possibility of Narnia, she and her siblings would have been left, as the book describes, “always in winter but never Christmas.”\n\nThe world is loud and familiar, but it does not see us and know us the way Jesus does. He is better, and He waits to meet with us in the secret places of our hearts that are not secret to Him. \n\nHeavenly Father, we confess it is difficult to close the door to a noisy world. But You alone know and offer what we really need. Teach us how to pray when we don’t know where to start. Help us to form words that are vulnerable and true, for they bring You glory. Amen.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:9-15, Proverbs 30:8, Luke 11:2-4, James 1:13-15, 1 Peter 1:3-9\n\nIf we stacked the books, commentaries, and sermons that have been written about the Lord’s Prayer together, we might be able to build a bridge long enough to get us to the hillside where Christ first taught us how to pray. Our fascination with this segment of the Sermon on the Mount seems surprisingly obvious: \n\nWe don’t know how to pray. \n\nI’ve been a follower of Christ for more than two decades. By God’s grace, I’ve grown leaps and bounds in my understanding of His Word and my grasp of my role in the Body of Christ. But when it comes to prayer, I still get the feeling that I’m somehow doing it wrong. Turns out, I’m in good company.  \n\nIt was after the Sermon on the Mount that the disciples begged, “Lord, teach us to pray” (Luke 11:1). Jesus patiently repeated the model He’d already given them. Even if we’ve read, meditated on, and listened to commentary about the Lord’s Prayer a zillion times, Jesus’ words remain worth considering. (Take a moment to look at them again now in Matthew 6:9-13.) When my own prayers feel clunky or inefficient, these words of Jesus’ jog my memory about a few things. \n\nFirst, prayer is not solely about me and my desires. It is first and foremost about God and His glory. If we rewind the Sermon on the Mount tapes just a smidge, we see that before Jesus taught us how to pray, He taught us how not to. He warned us not to pray fancy words in the hopes of being applauded by an audience of onlookers (Matthew 6:1-6). Prayer is not a tool we can use to bend the spotlight toward ourselves. Instead, Jesus’ model prayer opens with a list of “yours” that focus on the Father: \n\nHallowed be your name.\nYour kingdom come.\nYour will be done.\n\nMy prayers get off course because too often my heart is postured to think about my reputation, my little kingdom, and how I can convince God that my will needs to be done. But those things don’t get kicked to the curb entirely. The second half of the Lord’s prayer pivots to “us” beautifully. \n\nGive us this day our daily bread.\nForgive us our debts.\nLead us not into temptation.\nDeliver us from evil.\n\nOf the seven petitions given in the Lord’s Prayer, three are about God and four are about us. It’s the order of importance that is worth noting. God first, us second. It’s a pattern we should imitate in how we live, love, and pray. \n\nGoing over the Lord’s Prayer with a fine-toothed comb also reminds me that it’s okay to pray God’s words right back to Him. Many of Jesus’ words in the Lord’s Prayer nod to Old Testament passages and concepts (see 2 Chronicles 20:6; Proverbs 30:8; Psalm 71:4). Surely if the Word became flesh and quoted Himself, we can quote Him too. \n\nSince prayer is a conversation of the heart, the goal is not rote memorization. Isn’t it possible to say the same things over and over and still mean them deeply? I told my husband and children I loved them this morning at the breakfast table. It’s the same script I’ve been reading for years, and I mean it now more than ever. When we don’t know how to pray, we can pray God’s Word, confident it never loses an ounce of its power.\n\nFrom listeners on a hillside, to His disciples, to us, God invites us to lay down pretenses and performance and boldly approach Him through prayer. Lord, teach us to pray? Friends, He already has.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:16-18, 2 Samuel 12:15-23, Psalm 51:16-17, Isaiah 58:1-12, Revelation 19:6-10\n\nOne of my pet peeves is when people in public talk really loudly on purpose. Don’t get me wrong, I like loud and extroverted people in general, but the random strangers who want to be overheard irk me. Have you ever noticed someone talking about their awesome adventures, juicy gossip, or busy schedule, and it feels like they want you to hear every word? To know how cool or important they are? As I write this I’m sitting in a coffee shop next to a mighty loud cell phone talker. Deep breaths.\n\nIn my work as a counselor, I’ve learned about a common human defense called “projecting.” Projecting is essentially when you don’t want to face your own weakness, and so you deny your problems while seeing and disliking them in other people. Pet peeves are often projections. To be honest, I have on occasion noticed myself starting to talk extra loud in public and I hate it. That’s probably why it really bugs me so much in other people, because I’ve felt my own shallow desire to be admired and I’m not proud of that. \n\nThe truth is, most people deeply crave admiration and recognition from others. We want someone to tell us we are cool, perfect, strong, holy, or worthy. Jesus addressed this condition of the human heart in the book of Matthew, when He instructed His followers on how to fast. \n\nWhen Jesus spoke about fasting it was a common practice for Jewish people, but had become quite a show for some. This practice which is meant to humble people before the Lord, instead made them proud in their own self-righteousness. The fasting people made their deeds obvious to all around them by looking visibly disheveled and afflicted. Like the person talking loudly in the coffee shop, they wanted others to notice and affirm their value. \n\nTo the religious people fasting for human recognition, Jesus said, “You have received your reward.” Meaning, “You want human admiration so badly? Then enjoy it. But I know your heart, and you’re not doing this for me.” You see Christ told His followers to hide their fasting because He wanted to keep their intentions pure and their faces turned toward God alone, so they might find their worth and identity in Him.\n\nGod is always concerned with our heart than our sacrifices, and He shows that throughout the Sermon on the Mount. The Lord already knows the motives of our hearts and minds (Jeremiah 17:10)—the good, the bad, and the ugly. There is no sense in putting on a show, and there is no need either, because the Lord is “gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in faithful love” (Psalm 145:8-9). \n\nChrist gave us commands and practices to connect with us, not to put us under another law. As Paul proclaimed in Galatians, “For freedom, Christ set us free. Stand firm then and don’t submit again to a yoke of slavery” (Galatians 5:1). Sometimes that yoke of slavery looks like an insatiable need to have others admire you. But the Lord knows that a true sense of your value can only be found in Him, and so He wants to free you from that devastating rabbit chase.  \n\nWhatever works you are doing for the Lord, make Him your audience of one. And “your father who sees in secret will reward you.” \n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:19-24, Proverbs 28:22, Luke 12:13-21, Ephesians 5:5, 1 Timothy 6:17-19\n\nLook around you and consider this: it will all make a good bonfire some day. \n\nSomewhere along the line, that little catchphrase got filed in my heart. I find it equal parts jarring and comforting. Jarring because so much of what I’ve spent my life building is destined to pass away. Comforting because I have assurance that the laundry that needs folding and the bills that need to be paid and the floors that need mopping won’t be going with me into eternity. (Amen!) \n\nJesus is not anti-treasure. He’s the one who buried diamonds in the caves of Africa and gold in the mountains of Colorado. He also buried a craving for treasure deep inside our hearts. He wants us to be treasure hunters. But the kind of treasure we’re hunting matters. Here, Jesus helps us see that all that shines and glitters must be lumped into one of two categories. Only two. There is no third option. \n\n“Don’t store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal” (Matthew 6:19). \n\nCategory number one is perishable treasure. Anything you’ve ever bought or built with your own two hands is perishable. Your home, your car, your 401K? Perishable, perishable, perishable. Your wardrobe, your appearance, your accolades and attagirls? Those are all perishable too. So much of our lives is destined to make a good bonfire some day. As we picture the ashes, we are tempted to wonder, What’s left?\n\nAnswer: the imperishable. \n\n“But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves don’t break in and steal” (v. 20).\n\nWhat are these heavenly treasures? God’s Word points us to three things that will last forever: the Word of God (Isaiah 40:8), the people of God (John 3:16), and the kingdom of God (Psalm 45:6). Every penny, every second we invest in these things is untouchable, locked away in a heavenly vault. It cannot rot or rust. It cannot be stolen. It can never be taken away. \n\nJesus spoke about money and possessions often, but He never branded them as evil, just perishable. As we keep listening to the Sermon on the Mount we see the real reason we need these frequent reminders. \n\n“For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also” (v. 21). \n\nYou see, it’s not the treasure Christ is concerned about; it’s our hearts. He knows that worshiping our possessions will destroy us (v. 24). Our hearts will begin to rot long before our belongings do. He warns us to “take care and be on [our] guard against all covetousness” (Luke 12:15), not because He is worried we might amass too much treasure. We can’t begin to acquire enough riches to match His. He simply knows the moment is coming when our possessions will go up in smoke. We can buy insurance for our stuff, but Jesus is offering us insurance for our hearts. \n\nGo ahead and buy the new dress you found on sale. Pick out new granite countertops. Keep folding that endless pile of laundry, but know that a day is coming when God will stack all of our belongings together for kindling and strike a match (2 Peter 3:10). As we watch our earthly treasure turn to ashes, may we celebrate our investment in the riches that can never be taken from us.\n\n",

  "devo_title": "Do Not Worry",
  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 6:25-34, Psalm 147:7-11, Philippians 4:4-7, 1 Peter 5:6-11\n\nIt rained hard today, soaking into the summer skin of Texas, the red dirt and rolling hills. I’ve been saying for days I needed to water the Blue Salvias, even though they’re drought-resistant. They are drooping and limp. I brushed past them yesterday and saw small blue bits floating down as I did. It is easy to believe I alone am their savior, their maker. That I must breathe life into them, coddle them into adulthood, water them in the evening, and watch them at noonday when the sun is highest and hottest. But it rained hard today, and their soil is moist and wet, and their leaves shimmer with droplets clinging in earnest. They know they need the water. And they know their true Maker gives what they need.\n\nIn our home we have a saying: We must be faithful to the Word of God and not to an outcome. This is our way of encapsulating what Jesus said in Matthew 6: \n\n“So don’t worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you. Therefore don’t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own” (vv. 31-34).\n\nJesus was essentially saying that, in seeking first the kingdom, things will work out—not necessarily according to our plans, but according to His. When our attention and affection are rightly placed on God, we find that while He might not always give us what we want, He always gives us what we need. \n\nI caught myself in worry this past week, noting it because I am not normally a worrier. I plan, I think, I process, I pray, but rarely do I worry. I know nothing can be added to my life by worrying, but sometimes I think everything will be added to my life by planning, thinking, processing, and even praying. I think I am magician and maker and manipulator, and if I do it all well, I will add to my life and flourish. \n\nBut in doing so, I am deeply deceived. Nothing is added to my life by worrying or spending time fretting about how I think things ought to go. In the end, what is taken from my life is the time I spent on something other than faithfully seeking the kingdom of God. \n\nGod provides what we need, and if we don’t have it, we don’t need it. This is a hard thing to believe and an even harder thing to live out. We are prone to inventing needs: new couches and new houses, new cars, phones, bodies, and attitudes. It’s no wonder we’re also prone to worrying when those perceived needs are not met. We, like the flowers in my gardens, may droop, and we may wilt a little, we may suffer. But “after [we] have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called [us ] to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish [us]” (I Peter 5:10).\n\nToday, the God of all grace has given you all the graces you need because He cares for you. He will Himself restore you, confirm you, strengthen you, and establish you—for His sake and your good.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:1-6, Matthew 13:44-46, Romans 2:1-11, 1 Corinthians 4:1-5, James 5:7-11\n\nWe keep all the candy in a basket in the pantry. The leftover Halloween chocolates, the Easter jelly beans, gourmet candy canes from Christmas, and the Valentine hearts—they all end up in our candy basket. A whole year’s worth of sweets for five children. It’s quite a haul. Some years we just forget about it until it degrades, and I throw it away. Once we pulled it all out and decorated our most extravagantly baroque gingerbread house ever. This year, since the kids are a little older, I’ve been pulling out treats and doling them out for occasional sugar-joy.\n\nSince I don’t trust them to make responsible sugar choices, the kids aren’t allowed to get into the candy themselves. But I am. And I do. Not all of it tempts me. I could go the rest of my life without sour or hard candies. But there are some very grown-up chocolates and cookies that sing a sticky-gooey siren song. It floats out from under the door of the pantry, calling to me. I sneak in and steal a snack. Now, if one of my tender babes stole a treat, I would come down hard on them. I’d start by taking away the candy, then lecturing on the dangers of stealing, followed by the risks of sugar on teeth, and then I’d dole out the consequences.\n\nI’ve got a log in my eye. I think my kids have the problem, but really it’s me. I expect my kids to adhere to a standard that I definitely do not hold myself to. I find myself extending that double standard of judgment readily and easily to other people as well.\n\nHave you ever found yourself saying to your friends, “I can’t even imagine doing what she did”? And while it’s possible that you may never be tempted by that specific sin, you are tempted by your besetting sins. We all have those secret sins that we don’t want anyone to know about. And we all have our personal favorite everyday-variety sins that we brush away. Perhaps we’ve just brushed them away so many times that we cease to even think of them as sins. \n\nIt’s so much easier to focus on the speck in your brother’s eye, or the flaw in your sister’s character. But I’m just looking past the timber lodged in my own eye when I start looking around for everyone else’s sawdust.\n\nHonestly, we love to judge others differently than we judge ourselves. I have reasons, excuses, justifications for my own faults. And that’s it: when we’re talking about me, they are “faults” or “weaknesses”—definitely not sins. Or so I tell myself. But God has shown us more grace than we could ever show anyone else. Knowing this, how can I judge? \n\nThe poet G.M. Hopkins writes:\n\n“Mend first [the] vital candle in close heart’s vault:\n\nYou there are master, do your own desire;\nWhat hinders? Are you beam-blind, yet to a fault\nin a neighbor deft-handed? Are you that liar[?]”\n\nAre you beam-blind? Do you ignore the guttering of your own candle while criticizing someone else’s flame? Do you, while camped out in utter darkness, judge the dim light of others? Do you admonish others for candy-grabbing, while you actually do the same yourself, in secret?\n\nMay God grant us ears to hear and hearts to receive this rebuke to our hypocrisy. May we not trample such precious pearls of admonition, ignoring our logs. And thanks be to God, that He does not deal with us as our iniquities deserve, but has poured out mercy on us! (Psalm 103:10).\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:7-12, Proverbs 8:12-21, James 1:5-6, Revelation 3:19-20\n\nMy kids are constantly reminding me of how I behave with my heavenly Father—that is, like a child. It’s so incredibly humbling. \n\nOne such incident occurred a few years back, when we took our kids out for dinner on a Friday night. We were too stuffed for dessert, but when you go to the Cheesecake Factory and don’t order cheesecake, I’m pretty sure a puppy dies or an angel loses its wings. So we ordered a couple of slices to-go, my husband and I secretly planning to make a fun memory with the kids later that night.\n\nIt was already an hour past the kids’ bedtime when we headed home. Even so, as we drove, my oldest, who was seven at the time, grew concerned that his fun evening out with the family was coming to an abrupt end. He fretted and squirmed the whole ride home, even when we told him we had a surprise planned and encouraged him to trust us. But he just couldn’t. He made himself miserable worrying about the cheesecake and bedtime and other things seven-year-olds worry about.\n\nEven if you’re an adult, my guess is you can identify with this, at least a little.  \n\nThe plan was way better than he could have asked or imagined. Bedtime would have been a perfectly practical choice, but Ryan and I had planned to park in our little downtown, find a pretty place to sit, and enjoy a ridiculously late-night cheesecake feast with the kids, by the light of the moon.\n\nIt was a pretty great plan. It was the plan all along. \n\nAny amount of fretting and whining our kids did on the ride home, when they were certain they were going straight to bed, didn’t change what we had planned for them. We wanted to give them a sweet experience—not because of their good behavior, but because they are our children, we delight in them, and we wanted to give them a good gift.\n\n“If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him” (Matthew 7:11).\n\nWe have some pretty big ideas of how our lives should go. We feel strongly about what we don’t want to happen, and we’re perfectly willing to spend our entire lives fretting and fussing, not trusting that God is for us. \n\nOur Father wants to give us bread and fish and moonlit cheesecake picnics. He also wants to give us appropriate bedtimes and vegetables. Jesus knew His disciples were going to need righteousness, purity, unity, wisdom, humility, and more to carry out the work that was coming. And so He’s essentially saying to them, and us, “Just ask! It’s all yours!”\n\nHe has a pretty great plan. It’s been His plan all along.\n\nDo you lack wisdom? Is there something else you need in order to carry out the Father’s work? Do you trust that He will equip you with every supply? \n\nThe Father gives to His children generously and ungrudgingly (James 1:5). So go ahead: Ask. Seek. Knock. “For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened” (Matthew 7:8).\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:13-23, Psalm 16:7-11, Matthew 22:1-14, John 10:11-15, John 14:1-6, Romans 2:12-13\n\nI was once the proud owner of my very own pair of scratch ‘n sniff pants. Every time I bring this up, I receive looks as if I’ve been the victim of an unfortunate crime and then asked, “What was the scent? Sweat? Soap? Linen?” (Incidentally, I do think this was a missed opportunity in the ‘90s for laundry detergent companies.) But no, they were purple and smelled like grapes, of course.\n\nAs you can imagine, I was sitting high and walking tall in those bad boys. My friends marveled at the way they really did smell like grapes, and I loved letting people in on the secret. Purple pants were one thing, but grape-scented purple pants gave me a real edge in the fashion world. But it only lasted for so long. It turns out that the fruity fragrance was only guaranteed to last for the first ten washes. And since I wanted to maximize the appearance of my newfound style sense, those ten washes came and went pretty fast.\n\nSo there I was, boasting about the scratch ‘n sniff goodness, only for it to be gone. The worst part? No one believed I ever owned scratch ‘n sniff pants in the first place, and there’s little point to owning purple pants if they don’t smell like grapes. Just smelling like a fruit wasn’t enough; it wasn’t long-lasting, and it definitely wasn’t genuine.\n\nMatthew 7 talks about two kinds of fruits: good and bad. It says once we see a piece of fruit, we’ll know exactly which tree it came from. “A good tree can’t produce bad fruit; neither can a bad tree produce good fruit” (v.18).\n\nBut what if it smells good but looks bad? What if the person putting the sticker on the fruit uses the wrong one? Or, questions we more commonly ask:\n\nWhat if I sometimes sin and sometimes do the right thing?\nWhat if I repent after I do something wrong?\nWhat if I look like I have it all together from the outside, but I’m a mess on the inside?\n\nAll of these questions are rooted in fear:\n\nWhat will God do with me then?\nWill I still get into heaven?\nAm I enough?\n\nFriends, I love a good gray area as much as a pair of purple pants, but nothing about a gray area is eternal. There’s nothing—and no one—standing in “the undecided middle” that will not one day be sorted into good or bad. It will not be enough to just smell or taste like good fruit; we must be fruit grown from the love of God.\n\nBut let’s not be so foolish as to take this passage from the Sermon on the Mount, this lack of middle ground, as a scare tactic. May we always remember that the work has already been done. God separated the world into darkness and light, and Jesus grabbed us by the hand and took us to His side. It is the truest grace that we do not have to live in a gray area. Thanks be to God; we have already entered into the kingdom if we are in Christ Jesus.\n\nMay we smell like His fruit, and serve like His hands, just as we are remembered by His love. Amen.\n\n",

  "devo_title": "The Two Foundations",
  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Matthew 7:24-29, Psalm 18:1-6, Isaiah 17:10-11, Matthew 25:1-13, 2 Corinthians 3:18, James 2:20-23\n\nSomewhere in Nashville there’s a toddler-sized red and white cowgirl outfit from the 60s, complete with embroidered yellow flowers and white leather fringe. It was given to my daughter by our elderly neighbors, brought out of a wooden chest and handed to my wide-eyed girl when she was about 3 years old. Now, several years later, it circulates among my friends and their own little wide-eyed girls. \n\nCarlton and Joyce were good neighbors, always watching over our small yard from the front porch of their brick cottage across the street. I winced from my own front porch the day the wrecking ball swung with intention and knocked down that empty house. My toddler boys watched in delight and awe as the big, loud machines did their work, but my heart ached. \n\nMy friends lived three decades of life in that house. They raised their girls there, watching their city grow tall around them. They collected snowman figurines and looked out for their neighbors. Then, when most of their life had been lived, they moved on and let the wrecking ball do its worst. \n\nThe thing that strikes me about this short passage in Matthew is not the dichotomy of outcome, but the similarity of process. One house collapses with a crash and one stands strong—the contrast is stark. But the circumstances the two houses endure are remarkably similar. In fact, they are just the same: “The rain fell, the rivers rose, the winds blew and pounded that house” (Matthew 7:25, 27). Similar process, very different outcome. \n\nAll of our earthly houses will one day fall. We’re all honest enough to admit it. We know the things of earth don’t last and we’d do well to store up eternal possessions instead. But how do we do that? How do we build a metaphorical house that literally lasts forever? \n\n“Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock” (Matthew 7:24). \n\nHear Jesus’ words. Act on Jesus’ words. This is how we practically and actually build our house on the rock. \n\nDid your brain just register that last little paragraph as, “Be a good Christian”? If so, you’re not alone. I hear that, too. So let’s slow down and consider it again. \n\nHear Jesus’ words. Act on Jesus’ words. Here are just a handful of them: \n\n“Repent and believe the good news!” (Mark 1:15).\n\n“Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28).\n\n“Love one another. Just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another” (John 13:34).\n\n“Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you” (Matthew 7:7).\n\n“The one who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, will have streams of living water flow from deep within him” (John 7:38).\n\nThe words of Christ are life-giving; they are trustworthy and true. We can stake our lives on them. We can build our houses on them. \n\nHis words do not merely impart rules for smart living—tips for a favorable outcome. Jesus’ words impart life and love and salvation. The life Christ gives cannot be washed away by heavy rains, or consumed by the rising tide, or displaced by gale-force winds. His Word is eternal. It cannot become untrue. \n\nSo then, go ahead and build your life. Build houses and meet neighbors and raise wide-eyed girls and boys. Let’s live well this one life we’ve been given, but let’s do so on the only foundation that will last: the gospel of Jesus Christ. For when all our years and efforts and cottages crumble around us, His Word will stand. We are forever secure when our home is found in Him.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessica Lamb\n\nScripture Reading: Genesis 1:1-25, Isaiah 45:12, John 1:1-5, Hebrews 11:3 \n\nIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\n\nAll children, except one, grow up.\n\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times…\n\nOf all the most memorable first lines in literature, I’ve always loved the opening of God’s Word most:\n\nIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\n\nWhen I read these words from Genesis chapter 1, I’m often tempted to focus on the “how” in this opening passage. How has God always existed? How did He create Creation? How does He hold everything together? I try mining the text for answers about timelines and processes. But the Bible doesn’t emphasize the “how” as much as it draws our attention back to the “who” at the center of the story: God created. God saw that it was good. Genesis 1 doesn’t explain the details of how God created everything as much as it focuses on the nature of God Himself, the Creator.\n\nGod speaks and acts with purpose. He speaks the universe into existence. He moves the sky, mountains, trees, and oceans into place. Animals swarm and plants flourish at His command. None of this happens randomly—each part of the universe is arranged by Him. We live our lives in the world He’s created and sustains with purpose.\n\nGod is good, and He made everything to be good. Genesis 1 repeats the phrase, “and God saw that it was good,” six times (we’ll see it a seventh time in tomorrow’s reading). As God reflects on His creation— His handiwork—He tells us it is designed to be good. Later we’ll read how sin darkened the world with sickness and death, deception and decay, betrayal and greed. But it wasn’t created this way. It was created wholly good, and God had a plan to make it whole and good once again.\n\nOur good God wrote—and is writing—the story of the gospel. \n\nFor the next two weeks, we’ll read through the movements of this gospel story: creation, fall, redemption, and restoration. The word gospel means “good news,” and that news for us is this: when the time was right, the kingdom of God broke through on earth in the person of Jesus Christ. \n\nJesus, the Son of God, accomplished for us in His life, death, and resurrection what we could not accomplish for ourselves—forgiveness for our sin and reconciliation with God. The Creator demonstrated His love for the created in that ”while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). \n\nThe gospel story is for you, whomever you are, right where you are today. It is for those who believe, to remind them of the truth that continues to change them every day. And it’s for those who don’t believe, who are seeking or doubting or anywhere in between. \n\nThe opening words of Scripture are the beginning of an invitation to know and be known by the God who still speaks and acts with purpose, and who is working to make all things truly good.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Genesis 1:26-31, Psalm 8:1-9, 1 Corinthians 15:47-49\n\nWhen God created man, He scooped up the new dust of the new earth, blew the breath of life into it, and fashioned a man in His own image. Man is the only creation made in the image of God! It’s hard to know exactly what this means, because God is spirit and does not have a body like man (John 4:24). So bearing the image of God doesn’t mean we have His nose or His widow’s peak; it means we are eternal beings, worthy of worth, value, and dignity.\n\nEach one of us, every human being—regardless of where we are born or whether we can do calculus—carries this worth, value, and dignity imparted to us because we are God’s image-bearers. You can hear David’s incredulity in Psalm 8 when he marvels, “What is a human being that you remember him?” (v. 4). \n\nPaul perfectly articulates this tension between the glory and honor of being an image-bearer of God and being made from the gritty dust of the earth. We are both earthly and heavenly.\n\nIndeed, it seems like all this glorious attention and honor is more than we deserve. In fact, it is. Since the fall of humanity, we have marred this gracious glory of being God’s image-bearers with our sin. Now we are tempted to use our dominion over creation to hurt and control instead of steward and love. Nevertheless, God’s image remains inextricably stamped on our very being, even in our fallen state.\n\nIn his sermon “The Weight of Glory,” C.S. Lewis reminds us of this enduring truth:\n\nThere are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations—these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit—immortal horrors, or everlasting splendors.\n\nAll our actions, friendships, feuds, sidelong glances, and grocery store checkout interactions have eternal significance, for good or ill. The fall of humanity did not eliminate either our worth or our responsibility as God’s image-bearers.\n\nThe glorious news of the gospel is this: the perfect glory of who we are supposed to be is not lost forever. We have the promise of perfection restored and made even more glorious in Christ. Adam, the first man, was made of dust. But the second Man, Jesus, came from heaven. He was not created, but is coexistent and coeternal with the Father and the Holy Spirit—together as the Holy Trinity, they always have been and always will be (John 1:1–4). If we are in Christ, we straddle the life of the first man and the second Man; we bear the image of both. And in the end, because God has been mindful even of us, we will one day bear His image perfectly, reflecting the glory of Christ for all eternity.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Genesis 3:1-19, Deuteronomy 28:15-19, Isaiah 1:4-5, Romans 5:12-14\n\nFrom the time my pigtails bounced and my skirt twirled, I’ve always been a “good girl”—just ask my mama. I was a straight-A student who rarely got in trouble. I picked the right college, the right fella, the right outfit. You get the idea.\n\nTurning my life over to Jesus ripped my story into two distinct halves: life before Him and life after Him. Still, there isn’t a lot of drama in the “before” part. No skeletons in the closet. No criminal record. No massive public failures. It’s tempting to think that Jesus died to make me a new and improved version of myself: Erin 2.0. \n\nI’ve been walking with the Lord for more than two decades now, and the strangest thing has happened. The longer I know Him, and the more familiar I become with His Word, the uglier my heart looks. It’s like one of those optical illusion pictures that just looks like a bunch of squiggles at first. But the longer you stare, the more the edges of a hidden image start to emerge, and you see it’s not a pretty picture.\n\nSure, my behavior screams “good girl,” but my deceitful heart whispers thoughts of jealousy, pride, envy, hate, anger, bitterness, greed—the list goes on and on. Because here’s the truth: the Bible tells us no one is good except God alone (Romans 3:10). The achievements, accomplishments, and attitudes we attempt to polish up with a high shine are destined to look like filthy rags next to His blinding holiness (Isaiah 64:6).\n\nOur sin—and the sin of our first parents, Adam and Eve—is a reality the Bible doesn’t bother to sugarcoat (Genesis 3). We are the children of sinners who produce children who sin. We are not a people defined by our goodness, but rather all of humanity is “weighed down with iniquity” (Isaiah 1:4). We, all of us, have turned our backs on our Creator.\n\nWhen it comes to holiness, there is no bell curve. The Bible warns that everything, every single thing in our world is cursed by our sin and rebellion against God: our civilizations and our agriculture, our food and our children, our crops and our herds, our coming in and going out (Deuteronomy 28:17–19).\n\nIt has taken my entire life, but my good girl facade has cracked. Praise God. Following the rules doesn’t make me righteous, but the good news of the gospel keeps picking me up and dusting me off. “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).\n\nFacing up to the reality of my sin hurts. But when I wrestle with the gospel, the gospel always wins. Being good is not enough, but the thoroughly sufficient grace of a good and loving God is.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Genesis 4:1-16, Genesis 6:5-6, Jeremiah 17:9-10, Romans 6:20-23\n\nThe progression of Cain and Abel’s story in Genesis 4 can be summed up in three words: offering, sacrifice, curse.\n\nOffering: Cain and Abel both make offerings. Cain’s is rejected by God, not because the offering in and of itself is bad or wrong but because Cain’s heart behind it is. Abel’s is accepted, not because his offering is better but because “the Lord had regard for Abel” (Genesis 4:4).\n\nSacrifice: God warns Cain not to let his sin get the best of him, but Cain succumbs to it and kills his innocent brother. And his blood cries out to God from the ground (v. 10).\n\nCurse: Cain is cursed with fruitless labor and a restless, wandering spirit—a punishment that is too great for him to bear (v. 13).\n\nIt is not a hopeful ending, and humanity continues to suffer the consequences of this curse for generations to come. It’s a curse I feel even today.\n\nThis spring I spoke at women’s conference at a church. I prepared for months, reading Scripture, commentaries, looking up Greek and Hebrew verbs. A couple of weeks before the event, I found myself in the depth of shame over an old sin pattern I had fallen into yet again—the one I say I’ll never do again and then inevitably always do.\n\nHead in my hands, I asked God, How can I speak on a stage, proclaiming your Word while knowing the sinner I am? In that moment, I could not see beyond the curse. I felt the weight of Jeremiah 17:9: “The heart is more deceitful than anything else, and incurable—who can understand it?”\n\nThe progression of Christ’s story in the Gospels is similar to Cain and Abel’s, with a much different ending: offering, sacrifice, resurrection.\n\nThe imperfection and curse in Cain and Abel’s story was ultimately corrected and perfected through the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. He lifted the curse. We are no longer wanderers laboring for fruitless gain. As Paul says, “Since you have been set free from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification—and the outcome is eternal life!” (Romans 6:22).\n\nOur sin nature, like our shadows, is the dark side of us, one that we can ignore until the light hits us at the right moment and exposes it. Of every critical aspect of the gospel, sin is perhaps our least favorite to talk about, but it is also the most necessary in order to fully understand the salvation and hope offered in Jesus.\n\nThat day of the conference, as I was sitting in shame over my sin with only the curse as my truth, I felt the Holy Spirit point out the choice I was making. I was choosing the enslavement of the curse over the freedom of Christ. I realized then that it is not because of how good I am that I am able to speak about the Word of God. It is only because of how good He is. I could choose the curse and refuse to speak, or I could choose Christ and let His power be made perfect in my weakness.\n\nWe are offered this choice every day. My prayer is that even on those days when we feel the depths of our sin the most, we will choose freedom in Christ Jesus. It is for this freedom from sin and shame that He has come to set us free (Galatians 5:1). This is the full and complete gospel. May we choose to walk in it and thank God daily for Jesus’s sacrifice that has made this freedom possible for all who believe in Him.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Isaiah 24:1-6, Matthew 19:16-22, Romans 8:5-11, 18-25, Hebrews 7:26-28, Hebrews 9:22\n\nHave you ever waited for something you really wanted? Like really wanted. I bet we all have. Whether you wanted a friend on your first day of school, a fairytale romance, or an elf to do your laundry, we all know what it’s like to wait for something to come into fruition. \n\nIt’s hard to be patient when we have big hopes and dreams. We want what we want—now. And while all dreams are different, I believe we do have one in common: above all else, we long for heaven.\n\nIf we’re honest, we all feel unsatisfied with something in this life. From our personal lives to our politics, our world is grumbling and groaning (Romans 8:22–23). Maybe our relationships haven’t provided the community we need, or our jobs aren’t utilizing our full potential. Or maybe we aren’t being the women we know we were created to be. For most of us, there are many sources of personal frustration. Societally, we hear stories of tragedy every day. Tales of injustice and war flood our news feeds. The world is broken. The effects of the fall reverberate in and around us because things are not as they should be.\n\nBut why are we surprised when we encounter disappointment in this life? Where does this strong sense that the world should be better come from? We long for a perfect world we’ve never experienced. C.S. Lewis put it best when he said, “If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world.” \n\nWe were made for another world! In our heartbreak, discouragement, and righteous anger there is a yearning for the new heaven and new earth. Paul describes our eagerness and groaning like a woman in childbirth (v. 22). We can’t wait “for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies” (v. 23). Yet this redemption is not something we can accomplish on our own. Our separation from the holy God is a chasm we are utterly and irrefutably unable to cross. \n\nOnly Christ can reconcile us to God. His sacrifice paid for our sins. His resurrection defeated death forever. The world around us “wastes away and withers,” but we must remember the story isn’t over yet. Jesus came to offer eternal hope, and Jesus is coming back. “The sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us” (v. 18).  \n\nWhen we feel the weight of the pain and brokenness of this world, we must remember the greater story. We are caught in a fallen world between redemption and restoration. We who have the firstfruits of the Spirit within us should be groaning for more, waiting eagerly and with patience. We long for heaven, and heaven is coming.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: John 3:16-17, Matthew 15:29-31, Luke 18:31-33; John 19:28-30; Romans 5:6-11; Philippians 2:5-11\n\nThis is the big show. This is the central truth of our faith. We can quibble over infant baptism and transubstantiation and ordination, but on these points all Christians must come together and agree. God came to earth in the form of a man, and this God-Man lived, died, and rose from the grave. They called Him Jesus. While we were helpless and lost in our sin, Jesus died to save us completely (Romans 5:6).\n\nIt is the truest and most real fairy story ever known. The Church is the princess trapped by the pretending ruler of this world: a dragon who seeks to hoard all he can. The hero slays the dragon once and for all though a mighty and earth-shaking sacrifice. The dragon vanquished, the hero rescues the princess and brings her to his beautiful home. And they literally live happily ever after.\n\nNotice who’s who in this story. We are the Church and the princess: the bride of Christ. What does the princess have to do to make the story come off properly? The answer is… nothing.\n\nWe’d like to think we get to play a champion’s role in the story, but no matter how politically incorrect it may be, we, the bride, are helpless. The princess does not slay the dragon. She awaits the coming of her prince, the hero who will save her.\n\nAs unflattering as it is, we are helpless apart from Christ. If that weren’t enough to make us uncomfortable, Paul reminds us we were also ungodly enemies of God, undeserving of rescue (Romans 5:10). The Church is the the beggar bride, who has gotten overly comfortable living with the dragon. It is Christ who makes us holy, Christ who makes us lovely, Christ who washes us clean and removes the dragonish stench from our garments, preparing us for His kingdom.\n\nBy His life, He emptied Himself of glory, walking in perfect righteousness and enduring every earthly sorrow. By His death, He fully satisfied God’s just wrath against us, washing away our every sin. \n\nBy His resurrection, He defeated death and hell and secured newness of life for those who believe. \n\nBy His ascension, He advocates for us before the throne of grace, guaranteeing our eternal inheritance.\n\nThe great story of the gospel is the story of Christ. His life and death, His resurrection and ascension—this is the gospel. He is the gospel. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

  "devo_title": "Jesus Calls Us to Faith and Repentance",
  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kara Gause\n\nScripture Reading: Psalm 51:1-19, Joel 2:12-13, Mark 1:14-15, Romans 5:1-2, Romans 10:9-10\n\n“The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near.\nRepent and believe the good news!”\n-Mark 1:15\n\nRepent and believe.\n\nOf all the important words used to tell the gospel story, these are the two I’ve struggled to truly understand. Here in Mark 1, Jesus is calling us to repent and believe, but too many times I’ve interpreted His words as “grovel and behave.” Or really, Get your junk together, Kara, and then go out and do the work God has called you to. \n\nSometimes it’s easier for me to fall in line with the idea of God’s justice than it is to trust and receive His love for me. To trust Him, I have to be vulnerable, my heart and mind laid bare before Him. And yet to even begin to understand God’s gift of salvation, I have to understand my need for it, my need for Him. \n\nIn all of Scripture, David’s words in Psalm 51 have to be some of the most vulnerable, self-aware, and unguarded. Many of us know this part of David’s story and the impetus of this psalm—how he lusted after Bathsheba, bedded her and committed adultery with her, and then had her husband Uriah, his friend and confidante, murdered (2 Samuel 11–12). David left behind an enormous amount of suffering in the wake of his desire, and this psalm proves his awareness of his sin. But in the midst of all that relational wreckage, he confesses to the Lord: “Against you—you alone—I have sinned and done this evil in your sight” (vv. 3–4).\n\nDavid is grieving his sin before his Maker. He knows he is utterly lost and in need of God’s forgiveness when he prays, “God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me.” The earthly king is asking God to restore what’s been lost: the joy and peace that can only be found in right relationship with God (vv. 10–12). \n\nOur sin grieves God, and it should grieve us, too. For those who don’t trust Jesus for salvation, sin separates them from an eternity with God. For those who do trust in Him, their salvation is secure, but sin can still prevent them from experiencing an abundant, vibrant relationship with God now, on this side of heaven.\n\nLike David, we all have sinned and fall short of God’s glory and perfection. But this is the good news: we’re not called to live perfect lives. Jesus already did that for us! His righteousness is ours if we believe and trust in Him (Romans 3:23;10:9–10). We are called to continuous repentance, to keep turning away from our sin and the false promises of this world, and to turn back to God with all our heart (Joel 2:12).\n\nIf you’re anything like me, there have been times when you’ve struggled to believe you’re truly forgiven and radically loved (Zephaniah 3:17). You’ve heard the righteous rebuke in Jesus’s call to repent, but perhaps not the loving invitation to turn back to Him, and to continue coming back—not because your salvation isn’t secure, but because He knows our rebellious hearts keep us from knowing and enjoying His presence today. \n\nThe time has come! Jesus—Immanuel, “God with us”—has come near. Repent and return to Him. And then keep turning back to Him. Believe the good news is true, and that it’s true for you.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Ephesians 2:1-10, Romans 3:21-26, Galatians 4:4-7, 1 Peter 1:3-9, 18-19, John 10:27-30\n\n“In the matter of Samuel Ellis Gibson…”\n\nMy husband and I sat in a conference room with a notary named Janet, listening to the judge’s voice coming through the speakerphone. The judge sat on her bench somewhere in Florida, and as she spoke, we strained to hear every word. The journey to adopt our son had begun long before he was ever conceived. Now, he was seven months old, and a judge was making a final judgment in his case. \n\nShe looked at the facts, asked us her questions, and evaluated the progress he’d made since coming into our care. In the end, she made the final adoption decree. From that point forward, she said, it would be as if “the blood of Patrick Gibson and Claire Gibson were running through his veins.” I burst into tears—shocked at the beauty and finality of that legal language. This little child, who had no idea what was going on, had just had his life changed forever. \n\nThis is God’s grace to us. When we were weak, He left everything behind to come find us, save us, and adopt us into His family. At the cross, a final judgment was made on our behalf about our family, about our future. In essence, the gospel decrees over us: “From this point forward, it is as if the blood of Jesus were running in their veins.” \n\nWhat occurred at Calvary is a mystery—beautiful and scandalous and hard to understand. But throughout Scripture we are given word pictures to help those of us in the physical world understand what Jesus accomplished for us in the spiritual world. \n\nIt’s like an adoption (Galatians 3:26–4:7). We were lost but Jesus transferred us legally into His family, forever making us His brothers and sisters with access to the Father’s great riches (Romans 8:17; Colossians 1:12).\n\nWe were like lost sheep (John 10:1–18), but Jesus guided us gently to safety. We were once helpless, but Help came to rescue us.\n\nWe were once dead in our sins (Ephesians 2:1–5), but Christ made us alive again. \n\nWe had failed (Romans 3:23), but Christ gave us His perfect record as a substitute for our own. Grace is the lifeline we couldn’t throw to ourselves.\n\nAll of these metaphors are mere pictures of what we will one day experience fully, in His presence. But in the meantime, Jesus invites us to live our lives as His children. We can trust the final word of our great Good Judge. What He says sticks. We are children of God, saved by grace through faith in Jesus (Ephesians 2:5). This is our standing both now and forever.\n\nThanks be to our good and gracious God.\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: John 14:27, Colossians 1:13-23, Colossians 3:1-4, 2 Corinthians 5:17-19, 1 Corinthians 15:51-57\n\nThere have only been a few moments in my life when I have felt perfectly at peace. Moments of sweetness and beauty so profound, they leave me feeling as though the veil between now and eternity is lifted for just a moment, long enough to breathe in before the exhale drops me back into the mundane. \n\nWe live in this in-between, in the “already but not yet” reality of Christ. We only receive a few precursors of perfect peace in our mortal bodies, when our desire for heaven is almost satisfied for a second. We crave heaven because it is what we were made for. We long for peace because our hearts are hard-wired for it. \n\nIn her novel Housekeeping, Marilynne Robinson describes longing for peace like this: \n\nTo crave and to have are as like as a thing and its shadow. For when does a berry break upon the tongue as sweetly as when one longs to taste it, and when is the taste refracted into so many hues and savors of ripeness and earth, and when do our senses know any thing so utterly as when we lack it? And here again is a foreshadowing—the world will be made whole. \n\nToday’s passages give me similar moments of peace and pause. Colossians 1 and 1 Corinthians 15 are both banner moments in Paul’s writings. I can hardly read them without the very best kind of tears filling my eyes. These passages provoke the deepest, unfulfilled places in my heart. They remind me that I was made for a perfect eternity.\n\nOur eternal peace with God will be better than anything we can ever imagine. We will put on, as Paul writes so hopefully, our incorruptible bodies—new and perfect versions of ourselves (1 Corinthians 15:53). We will also be fully reconciled with God. \n\nTheologians categorize the work of Christ into different buckets, one of which is Christ as our reconciler. Sin alienates us from God and it makes us strangers to His mercy. There is an uncrossable chasm between us. But when we know Jesus and believe in Him, He makes our peace with God. He binds us up into covenant relationship, into perfect peace. \n\nJesus doesn’t offer that peace to us as a pretty gift wrapped in a bow; rather, He spent His breath and bones to purchase it for us, “making peace through his blood, shed on the cross” (Colossians 1:20). And so because of His blood, we claim reconciliation as God’s people. We will be reunited to Him forever. Death is no longer an uncrossable chasm. Death has lost its sting, having been swallowed up in Christ’s victory on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:54–55).\n\nAs those who have been raised with Christ, let us seek eternal things, not earthly things. One day He will appear again, and we will join Him in glory. But as we wait, let us rest in the peace of Christ today. Lord, hasten the day of your return.\n\n",

Having only known a broken world, how do I even begin to imagine what the new creation will look like?\n\nPain will no longer exist? Death, crying, and grief will no longer exist? The wolf and the lamb will eat together? Aging will not be an issue?\n\nI love the idea of all of these things, but like trying to imagine a new color, I don’t have a frame of reference for them. And so they feel more like a far-off dream than a future reality. But whenever the big picture of Scripture is too hard for me to imagine, it helps me to zoom in closer, to look at the passage on a smaller scale and consider where I’ve seen this truth play out in my own life.\n\nPerhaps trying to imagine this earth returning to its Eden state is too difficult, but has God not already done the same work of restoration in me? At the very heart of the gospel is a God who restored us to Himself through His Son Jesus Christ. Now anyone who is in Christ is a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nThis means restoration is happening now. Newness is happening now. Maybe we can’t imagine what the new heaven and new earth will look like, but we need look no further than ourselves in order to see the power of restoration and possibility of newness through our Father.\n\nThis gives me even greater hope. Because now my hope is not just in the future restoration. I can be assured that restoration is possible today. By the work of the Spirit and with the example of Jesus Christ, we—as a new creation ourselves—can work toward this restoration in our relationships, in our work, and in our communities.\n\nAs the apostle Peter said, the promise of the new creation has great implications for how we live our lives today:\n\nBut the day of the Lord will come like a thief; on that day the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, the elements will burn and be dissolved, and the earth and the works on it will be disclosed. Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, it is clear what sort of people you should be in holy conduct and godliness as you wait for the day of God and hasten its coming (2 Peter 3:10–12).\n\nIf God could restore us to Himself, how much more could He restore? Relationships, communities, broken dreams—not only will all that is broken be made new on the next side of heaven, but God is making things new on this side too.\n\nToday, when I read about the new creation I am trying to see it not as some sort of ethereal image I can’t comprehend, but as proof that God can restore all things in heaven and on earth. His promise of restoration doesn’t have to puzzle me; it can energize me, giving me purpose in how I work out restoration here until the day of our God.\n\nSo if you are doubting today whether the brokenness of this world can ever be mended, or that true reconciliation could ever happen, or that the pain will ever go away—look to Scripture and what God has done for you and and remember His words, said in present tense, “Look, I am making everything new” (Revelation 21:5).\n\n",

So unspeakable, he would never disclose it; he would only say this: “Something happened to me, which was known only to myself, and which caused me the most severe mental suffering. The hymn was the fruit of that suffering” (Dough 111).\n\nThe hymn was “O Love That Will Not Let Me Go,” which famous American hymnwriter Fanny Crosby would affectionately call her favorite (112). \n\nCrosby and Matheson had something unique in common: they were both completely blind. Born with sight, Matheson’s eyes began failing over the course of his childhood, and he was fully blind by the age of eighteen. But that did not stop young George from pursuing what he loved. Coming from a wealthy merchant family in Glasgow, Matheson studied at the University of Glasgow and graduated with honors. He went on to become an influential pastor, leading a congregation of 2,000 members at St. Bernard’s Church in Edinburgh. \n\nBelievers from all over Scotland made the trek to St. Bernard’s to hear the blind preacher deliver his passionate messages from the pulpit, and congregants from all over the world sing his famous hymn to this day. Still, none but God and George himself will ever know what happened on that day in Innellan, as the man sat alone and furiously penned the words of this beloved hymn, the verses coming to him as if dictated by someone else. “It was the quickest work I ever did in my life,” he would later say. “I am quite sure the whole work was completed in five minutes” (111). \n\nThe Cross, the Joy, the Light, the Love—these were the truths that held tight to a Scottish pastor as he suffered through a pain he could not bear to name. They are the truths that hold us too.\n\nO Love That Will Not Let Me Go\nBy George Matheson; Albert L. Peace\n\nO love that will not let me go,\nI rest my weary soul in thee;\nI give thee back the life I owe,\nthat in thine ocean depths its flow\nmay richer, fuller be.\n\nO light that foll’west all my way,\nI yield my flick’ring torch to thee;\nmy heart restores its borrowed ray,\nthat in thy sunshine’s blaze its day\nmay brighter, fairer be.\n\nO joy that seekest me through pain,\nI cannot close my heart to thee;\nI trace the rainbow through the rain,\nand feel the promise is not vain\nthat morn shall tearless be.\n\nO cross that liftest up my head,\nI dare not ask to fly from thee;\nI lay in dust life’s glory dead,\nand from the ground there blossoms red\nlife that shall endless be.\n\n",

Music composition was his passion, but he didn’t have a piano in his tiny new abode. \n\nWhen a neighbor offered a dusty organ with cracked leather and stiffened stops for the price of five dollars, Haldor eagerly bought the wheezy organ and set about composing. As he settled into family life, he wrote many songs on that first, imperfect instrument. \n\nOne of the early compositions Haldor wrote on that five-dollar organ was “Wonderful Grace of Jesus,” which he, in turn, sold for five dollars (Brown 117). This small investment helped him write more songs, better songs—over 4,000 hymns in his lifetime—and he went on to found his own music publishing company.\n\n“Wonderful Grace of Jesus” is a triumphant song about the abundant grace of Christ (1 Timothy 1:14), one that is deeper than the sea and higher than the mountains.

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nText: Deuteronomy 32:1-4, Matthew 7:24-29, 1 Corinthians 3:10-15\n\nEdward Mote wrote just one hymn in his lifetime. From what we know of his life, “My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less” was just as much an anthem of his own testimony as it has become for believers all over the world. \n\nHaving grown up knowing nothing of God or His existence, Mote first attended church and became a Christian as a young adult. While still a new believer, he was compelled to try his hand at hymn writing. Thus, Mote wrote from a basic, yet profound understanding of his salvation. \n\nLater that same week, he visited a married couple at the wife’s sickbed. Without a hymnal handy to lead them in a song of worship, Mote produced a folded-up piece of paper upon which he had worked out four verses and a chorus. Together, they sang the hymn now known as “My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less” for the first time, blessed by the truths of God’s Word in the lyrics.   \n\nTwenty years later, as a Baptist minister, Mote was instrumental in securing a building for his congregation. As a show of thanks, the congregants offered to put the deed in his name, but Mote refused, saying, “I do not want the chapel. I only want the pulpit; and when I cease to preach Christ, then turn me out of that!” (Dough 72). Mote understood the profound simplicity of what remains secure and what will always be slipping away.\n\nChrist is the sole means of our salvation. Our hope is truly built on nothing less than Jesus.\n\nMy Hope Is Built On Nothing Less\nBy Edward Mote; William B. Bradbury \n\nMy hope is built on nothing less\nthan Jesus’ blood and righteousness;\nI dare not trust the sweetest frame,\nbut wholly lean on Jesus’ name.\n\nRefrain:\n\nOn Christ, the solid rock, I stand;\nall other ground is sinking sand,\nall other ground is sinking sand.\n\nWhen darkness veils his lovely face,\nI rest on his unchanging grace;\nin every high and stormy gale,\nmy anchor holds within the veil. [Refrain]\n\nHis oath, his covenant, his blood\nsupport me in the whelming flood;\nwhen all around my soul gives way,\nhe then is all my hope and stay. [Refrain]\n\nWhen he shall come with trumpet sound,\nO may I then in him be found,\ndressed in his righteousness alone,\nfaultless to stand before the throne. [Refrain]\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Genesis 9:8-17, Psalm 90:1-17, Lamentations 5:19\n\nIsaac Watts never wanted to write hymns. In fact, he didn’t even enjoy singing. A scraggly and rebellious teenager in Southampton, England, Watts was a poet who refused to sing psalms in church because they didn’t rhyme. \n\nWatts’ lyrical appreciation and incessant poetics were an annoyance to everyone around him, including his own preacher father, who threatened to whip his son if he continued his daily rhyming. The son replied, “O Father do some pity take, and I will no more verses make!” (McKay 67). \n\nAfter his anger subsided, Watts’ father challenged his writer son to create something “better” than King David’s psalms. At just 18 years old, Watts began writing hymns that were loosely rooted in the Psalms and aligned with his own singing preferences (which, of course, included rhyming). He aimed to communicate timeless gospel truths in contemporary language, as if King David was writing in the present-day 1700s (Watts 15).\n\nHis hymn “O God, Our Help In Ages Past” is based on Psalm 90:4:\n\nFor in Your sight a thousand years\nare like yesterday that passes by,\nlike a few hours of the night.\n\nWhen Watts’ signature style is applied to this passage, it becomes a singable hymn: \n\nA thousand ages in Thy sight\nAre like an evening gone;\nShort as the watch that ends the night\nBefore the rising sun.\n\nWhether sung in original psalmic context or modern rhyming prose, the importance of recalling God’s character remains the same. When we adopt the practice of recalling His past faithfulness, we are reminded of His present kindness.\n\nO God, Our Help in Ages Past\nBy Isaac Watts\n\nOur God, our help in ages past,\nour hope for years to come,\nour shelter from the stormy blast,\nand our eternal home:\n\nUnder the shadow of your throne\nyour saints have dwelt secure;\nsufficient is your arm alone,\nand our defense is sure.\n\nBefore the hills in order stood\nor earth received its frame,\nfrom everlasting you are God,\nto endless years the same.\n\nA thousand ages in your sight\nare like an evening gone,\nshort as the watch that ends the night\nbefore the rising sun.\n\nTime, like an ever-rolling stream,\nsoon bears us all away;\nwe fly forgotten, as a dream\ndies at the opening day.\n\nOur God, our help in ages past,\nour hope for years to come,\nstill be our guard while troubles last,\nand our eternal home!\n\n",

From out in the dark waves they heard cries for help from a boy struggling to stay afloat. Her husband ran into the water to rescue him. But despite his efforts to bring the boy back to shore, both he and the child drowned.\n\nShocked, grieving, and penniless, Louisa and her daughter struggled in the years that followed. The tragedy of her husband’s death weighed heavily on her, both as a mourning wife and as the unexpected head of household. She didn’t have money for food, and their hungry days passed slowly, sustained by a quiet faith in God’s goodness in spite of their dire circumstances.\n\nOn a day that began like any other, Louisa heard a sound at the door. Upon opening it, she found a solitary parcel on her front doorstep. Not seeing anyone around, she looked inside and discovered a small gift of food and money (McKay 89). That same day she penned the words, “‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, just to take Him at His word.” \n\nLouisa’s life gives a powerful testament of simple yet mighty faith in Jesus. Her story reminds us that, even in the scary and sad places, God is surely our salvation. We can “trust and not be afraid” (Isaiah 12:2). Let us take Jesus at His word and believe that He will care for us.\n\n‘Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus\nBy Louisa Stead\n\n‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,\nand to take him at his word;\njust to rest upon his promise,\nand to know, “Thus saith the Lord.”\n\nRefrain:\n\nJesus, Jesus, how I trust him!\nHow I’ve proved him o’er and o’er!\nJesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!\nO for grace to trust him more!\n\nO how sweet to trust in Jesus,\njust to trust his cleansing blood;\nand in simple faith to plunge me\nneath the healing, cleansing flood!

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Genesis 1:26-31, Job 28:12-28, John 1:18\n\nWalter Chalmers Smith set out with lofty goals when he sat down to write the words to “Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise.” Although it later became his most famous hymn, he was hesitant to complete it, and spent almost forty years revising, reconsidering, and researching before it reached its final form.\n\nDuring those years of meditating on what it means for God to be both immortal and invisible, Smith ministered at five different churches throughout Europe. As he honed his preaching skills, he also practiced his skills as a poet. His prolific collection of poetry reflects on the depths of human sin and the heights of God’s inexpressible greatness (Bailey 456).\n\nSmith’s love for poetry emboldened him to explore his desire to know the unknowable. He used phrases like “light inaccessible hid from our eyes” in an attempt to describe the indescribable. Job used the same kind of paradoxical phrases to explain the reach of an eternal God, who “fixed the weight of the wind” (Job 28:25).\n\nThrough his struggle to express the inexpressible, Smith created a unique hymn. He invited his parishioners to join him in singing about the deep mystery of a God who is both intimate and ineffable. \n\nSmith’s forty-year journey to settle on lyrics for this one hymn is a profound testimony to the mystery of our immortal, invisible God. Even as we spend years of our lives meditating on His character, may we never cease to be awed by the Ancient of Days.\n\nImmortal, Invisible, God Only Wise\nBy Walter C. Smith\n\nImmortal, invisible, God only wise,\nin light inaccessible hid from our eyes,\nmost blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,\nalmighty, victorious, thy great name we praise.\n\nUnresting, unhasting, and silent as light,\nnor wanting, nor wasting, thou rulest in might:\n\nthy justice, like mountains high soaring above,\nthy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.\n\nTo all, life thou givest, to both great and small;\nin all life thou livest, the true life of all;\nwe blossom and flourish like leaves on the tree,\nthen wither and perish, but naught changeth thee.\n\nThou reignest in glory, thou dwellest in light,\nthine angels adore thee, all veiling their sight;\nall praise we would render; O help us to see\n’tis only the splendor of light hideth thee!\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Job 12:7-12, Psalm 148:1-14, Matthew 6:26\n\nOf all the monastic saints, we see reminders of Saint Francis of Assisi the most. He is immortalized in backyards everywhere as a stone lawn statue, usually cradling a bird or comforting a fawn. And there is truth behind the sculptures; Francis was actually very well known for his care and attention to animals. In fact, his enthusiasm for preaching the gospel and his love for animals occasionally drove him to go so far as to preach sermons to flocks of birds. \n\nIn 1226, with his vision failing and his life nearing its end, he wrote a poem titled “The Canticle of the Sun.” In his weakened state, he celebrated the psalmic call for all creation to praise God as Creator (Psalm 19).\n\nSaint Francis was always keen on unity with nature. In fact, in his original version of this hymn he referred to creation as family: brother sun, sister water, brother fire, mother earth, brother wind, and sister moon (Bailey 264). Although some English translations maintain those sentiments, when William Draper translated it from Latin to English in 1910 for a children’s festival, he paraphrased the original poem, leaving out references to any familial relationships with creation. \n\nWe can all join with creation to say, “Hallelujah!” and praise God for His creative goodness. We can sing with the psalmist in Psalm 148, praising God with the stars and the waters, the sea monsters, lightning, and clouds. Let us join together to praise and honor the Lord of heaven and earth.\n\nAll Creatures of Our God and King\nBy William Draper\n\nAll creatures of our God and King,\nlift up your voice and with us sing:,\nalleluia, alleluia!\nO burning sun with golden beam,\nand shining moon with silver gleam,\nO praise him, O praise him,\nalleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n\nO rushing wind so wild and strong,\nwhite clouds that sail in heaven along,\nalleluia, alleluia!\nNew rising dawn in praise rejoice;\nyou lights of evening find a voice:\n\nO praise him, O praise him,\nalleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n\nCool flowing water, pure and clear,\nmake music for your Lord to hear:\n\nalleluia, alleluia!\nFierce fire, so masterful and bright,\nproviding us with warmth and light.\nO praise him, O praise him,\nalleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n\nEarth ever fertile, day by day\nbring forth your blessings on our way;\nalleluia, alleluia!\nAll flowers and fruits that is you grow,\nlet the his glory also show;\nO praise him, O praise him,\nalleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n\nAll you who are of tender heart,\nforgiving others, take your part;\nalleluia, alleluia!\n\nAll you who pain and sorrow bear,\npraise God and on him cast your care;\nO praise him, O praise him,\nalleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n\nLet all things their Creator bless,\nand worship him in humbleness,\nalleluia, alleluia!\n\nPraise, praise the Father, praise the Son,\nand praise the Spirit, Three in One:\n\nO praise him, O praise him,\nalleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n\n",

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Russ Ramsey\n\nText: Exodus 24:3-8, Romans 5:6-11, Hebrews 9:15-22\n\nThe hymn “Nothing but the Blood” was composed by Robert Lowry (1826-1899), a university professor and Baptist preacher from New England. \n\nAlthough an accomplished musician, Lowry wanted most to be known as a preacher. He said, “Music, with me has been a side issue… I would rather preach a gospel sermon to an appreciative audience than write a hymn. I have always looked upon myself as a preacher and felt a sort of depreciation when I began to be known more as a composer” (Butterworth 165). \n\nHis preference for preaching comes through in the way his most popular hymn plays like a sermon. The hymn utilizes a call-and-response pattern similar to that of Psalm 136, in which the leader of the assembly makes a statement about God, and the people respond, “His steadfast love endures forever.”\n\nThe lines of the hymn alternate—the odd lines asking essential questions about what reconciles us to God, while the even lines respond with the same refrain: “Nothing but the blood of Jesus.” The chorus, then, draws the musical sermon together, reminding us why the blood of Jesus is so necessary: “Precious is the flow that makes me white as snow. No other fount I know. Nothing but the blood of Jesus.”\n\nBy design, call-and-response hymns lead believers to confess their faith together. May we sing such songs over one another. And may “the message about the Messiah dwell richly among you, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, and singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, with gratitude in your hearts to God” (Colossians 3:16). \n\nNothing but the Blood\nBy Robert Lowry\n\nWhat can wash away my sin?\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\nWhat can make me whole again?\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nRefrain:\n\nO precious is the flow\nthat makes me white as snow;\nno other fount I know;\nnothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nFor my pardon this I see:\n\nnothing but the blood of Jesus.\nFor my cleansing this my plea:\n\nnothing but the blood of Jesus.

Regardless, the gospel truths echoed in this hymn belong to all of us, those who are childlike in both stature and faith (Bailey 184). \n\nToday, this hymn remains a strong, timeless invitation and prayerful response to the imagery found in Psalm 23. While the psalmist affirms the Lord’s faithfulness and goodness, the hymn writer actively calls upon God out of personal need. When coupled together, the psalm and hymn serve as a call-and-response: \n\n“The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I lack” (v. 1).\nSavior, like a shepherd lead us, much we need Thy tender care.\n\n“He lets me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters” (v. 2).\nIn Thy pleasant pastures, feed us.\n\n“He renews my life; He leads me along the right paths for His name’s sake” (v. 3).\nFor our use Thy folds prepare:\n\nBlessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,\nThou hast bought us, Thine we are.\n\nOur endless call to our Shepherd is that of lost, needy, hungry children, and His response is love. We are His lambs—tender, wandering, forgetful—and yet He leads us still. He is our sure comfort and restful pasture. May we continually recall God’s character and call out for His faithful response.   \n\nThou hast loved us, love us still.\n\nSavior, Like a Shepherd Lead Us\nBy Dorothy A.

  "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Psalm 27:4-6, Psalm 45:1-17, Isaiah 33:17\n\nAs sweet as a lullaby, “Fairest Lord Jesus” seems like a delicate hymn for rosy-cheeked children. But it has a surprising and legendary German history, originally sung as a far rougher, more warlike battle hymn.\n\nLegend has it that the hymn originated in the 12th century as a Teutonic Knights’ anthem sung in Prussia under the Holy Roman Empire, or as an 18th century tune from the Germanic region of Silesia. Either way, the current tune carries the rousing moniker of “Crusader’s Hymn” (Brink 62).\n\nThis is due in part to Franz Liszt, prodigy pianist and world-renowned composer. He used this tune in his 1862 oratorio, “The Legend of St. Elizabeth,” as the battle march for his costumed crusaders. Suddenly, this quiet, lullaby of a song appeared in an entirely new light, all dressed up and armed for war. \n\nWith a closer look, we see this is true for many hymns and truths of the gospel as well. They can be sung gently and reassuringly, for we are God’s children, and we desperately need the comfort and beauty of this promise: “to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, gazing on the beauty of the Lord” (Psalm 27:4).\n\nBut the gospel is also a clarion call to the safety of our Lord in battle: “For He will conceal me in His shelter in the day of adversity; He will hide me under the cover of His tent; He will set me high on a rock” (Psalm 27:5-6). Thanks be to God, who preserves us and fights for us. And thanks be to Jesus, our Savior, the ruler of all nature.\n\nFairest Lord Jesus\nBy Joseph A.

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nI used to really love the law (Exodus 20:1–17). I remember enthusiastically singing the Ten-Commandments song “The Perfect Ten” at school and church with the confidence of a child whose Christian walk was just beginning.\n\nNumber one, we’ve just begun: God should be first in your life!Number two’s the idol rule: those graven images aren’t nice.\n\nI’d assure myself as I sang…\n\nNumber three: God’s name should be never spoken in jest.Number four: the Sabbath’s for our worship and for rest.\n\nSo far, so good. Our family was known for nothing if not for our Sunday naps.\n\nNumber five: we all should strive to honor father and mother.Number six: don’t get your kicks from killing one another.\n\nSuccess!\n\nNumber seven: life is heaven when you’re true to your mate.Number eight: don’t steal and break this rule for goodness’ sake!\n\nNumber seven was easy—I didn’t even have a mate!\n\nNumber nine: don’t be the kind who goes around telling lies.Number ten: don’t covet when you see your neighbor’s house or wife!\n\nI was doing so well. It had never occurred to me to covet my neighbor’s wife. In my mind I would sing that song with a full band playing behind me—like a victory song. I was delighting in God’s law because it was just so keepable! But as I grew to understand the law, I began to understand how difficult it was to follow.\n\nI thank God that He brought me out of the age of check, check, check into the maturity of, If this is the measuring stick, I will never measure up. And even more, I’m thankful He didn’t leave me there with my checklist. When God mercifully, gradually granted me eyes to see how readily I broke His law by commission, omission, and flat-out rejection of Him, the big band musicians in my head began to slowly lower their instruments and solemnly take their seats. I wasn’t delighting in God’s law at all. I had been delighting in my “keeping” of His law.\n\nBut my delight hasn’t gone away; it has instead shifted and matured. Now, my soul finds rest in knowing that the law has been fulfilled by Christ on my behalf. Because of Jesus, the law no longer justifies or condemns us—it frees us and becomes our guide for thankful obedience to the One by whom we are justified.\n\nDo you get that? If the law is our measuring stick, every one of us will be found unrighteous. But Jesus kept God’s law perfectly, imparting His righteousness to us so that when we are measured, we, too, will be counted as righteous—as perfect law-keepers!\n\nNow, when I catch myself humming that childhood ten commandments tune (or teaching it to my children), I hear it differently. Not as a reminder of what I have to do, or even as a condemnation of what I can’t do. I hear it now as an assurance of what He has done, and as the kindest, clearest roadmap to the heart of the Father. He makes me righteous, and I delight in pleasing Him. “Oh that my ways may be steadfast in keeping [His] statutes!” (Psalm 119:5, ESV).\n\nLord, I love your law. “With my lips I declare all the rules of your mouth” (v.13, ESV).\n\n",

But when a million people die, we treat it as a statistic.\n\nThis unsettling observation shows how inconsistent we humans can be concerning the value of a life. On the one hand, if a friend or relative or some other cherished person is taken from us, we are moved to deep and abiding sorrow. On the other hand, if a million lives with whom we share no personal connection are suddenly wiped out by a viral pandemic or natural disaster, any initial sadness and shock we feel can fade within weeks, and possibly within hours. The one who is close to us seems more precious even than the million who are further away.\n\nOur selective valuation of our fellow humans invites a haunting question: If the million don’t matter to us as much as the one, then can we honestly say that the one really matters at all? How precious are many lives, how precious is a single life, and how precious is my life… really?\n\nEach of us living today is one in seven billion. Of all the people who have ever lived, we are one in 107 billion. David hinted at this relative smallness of ours when he cried out to God, “What is a human being that you remember him, a son of man that you look after him?” (Psalm 8:4).\n\nThankfully, Scripture provides us with a strong and sure answer. David continued, “You made him a little less than God and crowned him with glory and honor” (v.5). The poet-king after God’s own heart is genuinely awestruck by the truth about all humans and about each individual human: We are made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). Of all creatures everywhere, only humans are esteemed in this way.\n\nThis truth about our inestimable value becomes even more compelling when we realize that in Christ, we are the image of God but also much more: Scripture tells us we are the children of God. And as His children, He gives us life through His Word and teaches us His ways (Psalm 119:25–26). In his letter to the Galatians, Paul amplifies this astonishing truth by reminding us that through faith in Christ, God has adopted us, sent His Spirit into our hearts, invited us to call Him “Father,” and made us heirs of all that is His (Galatians 4:4–7).\n\nAs Brennan Manning has written, “Define yourself radically as one beloved by God. This is the true self. Every other identity is an illusion.”\n\nThe next time you look in the mirror, don’t for a moment think that you’re looking at a mere face in the crowd. Don’t for a moment think that you’re looking at a tragedy or a statistic. You have no true basis for looking at yourself in this way. Rather, you are looking at an esteemed crown of God’s creation, a beloved child of God, and a privileged heir of everything.\n\nThis is your true self. Every other identity is an illusion.\n\nScott Sauls is husband to Patti, dad to Abby and Ellie, and senior pastor of Christ Presbyterian Church in Nashville, Tennessee.

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jessica Lamb\n\nOne of my strongest memories from my sophomore year of high school is of a black, 5-inch thick three-ring binder I carried everywhere. I was part of the not-so-exclusive academic quiz bowl team at my school, and every few weeks, I would compete against other schools to see which team could “buzz in” first to earn points answering trivia questions. My binder was filled with the printed records of previous tournament questions and answers. Though questions were rarely repeated, I poured over that binder every opportunity I could find, hoping that my incessant studying might reveal recurring subject matter or a pattern in how questions are worded for tournaments to give me an edge over the competition. To this day, I’d still choose a trivia night at a local restaurant over almost any other activity.\n\nI used to think taking this same approach to Scripture was proof that I loved God’s Word. Studying the Bible—its words, history, cultural contexts, and languages—has been life-giving to my faith in my undergraduate and postgraduate studies, as well as in my career. But I have to be reminded that life as a follower of Jesus is so much more than just memorizing facts about God or storing up interesting trivia about the Bible. Our reading and study of Scripture should shape us and reorient our hearts as it shows us who He is and who we are in Him.\n\nI come back to the book of James over and over when I find my heart wanting to make a god of knowing about God, rather than truly knowing Him. The book is full of direct one-liners that cut right to the truth: truly delighting in God’s Word means living out what the Word teaches us. In the opening passage of his letter, James sums this up by telling believers that we must be “doers of the word and not hearers only” (James 1:22).\n\nHearing without acting is more than useless—it’s self-deception, because as believers, we are new people born of the gospel (v.22,18). James writes that God has implanted His Word in us (v.21). We miss the point if we are not willing to let its truth take root, growing and bearing fruit in us as we are changed and made more like Christ.\n\nEssentially, we are living out what the psalmist pleads with God to do: transform him so that he can keep God’s commands. By His Spirit and His Word, we’ve been made into new people. Unlike the person who looks in the mirror and responds, “I forget,” when asked what they look like (vv.23–24), we are called to remember who we are as we walk away from reading the Bible. If we go about our lives without acting on what it teaches, we live as fractured people, at odds with who we now are in Christ. Praise God, because He’s done the hardest work in giving us new hearts already!\n\nBeing in the Word of God every day equips us to live out the Word of God every day. It guards against forgetting what is true of our God and of ourselves. Let our prayer echo that of the psalmist as we come to the Bible each day: ”Teach me, LORD, the meaning of your statutes, and I will always keep them” (Psalm 119:33).\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nI remember listening to journalist Malcolm Gladwell interview Nashville legend and famed songwriter Bobby Braddock. Their conversation centered on what goes into writing a truly sad song, the kind of tune that finds you driving with one hand on the steering wheel so the other can be free to wipe the tears from your eyes.\n\nAs they talked, they decided that country music has a leg up on rock and pop when it comes to mournful tracks, but the question that lingered was Why? In the end, Braddock said it came down to details: “We cry when melancholy collides with specificity.” It’s one thing to sing about heartache, and another thing entirely to sing about standing by a lost friend’s grave and the angels’ faces delighting to welcome that friend home. Take a listen to “Go Rest High on That Mountain” by Vince Gill to hear what I’m talking about.\n\nThe reason that details help sad songs resonate with us is because they echo our own experience. We live in a world of details, not generalities. Somehow, the details make a thing more real. When it comes to God’s Word, I delight in the details. You see, in the ancient world, there was no paper. Instead, texts were written on papyrus, a material similar to paper but made out of certain flattened reeds—and papyrus wasn’t cheap. That means that everything included in God’s Word is important. There are no throwaway lines, no unimportant details.\n\nIn the story of Rahab, there’s a detail that jumps off the page for me. When she lets the two Israelite spies down through her window, she does so with a “scarlet cord” (Joshua 2:18). And it was this scarlet cord that would identify her home and keep her safe when the Israelites later attacked Jericho. It wasn’t brown or blue or white. It was a scarlet rope—and that makes all the difference in telling this story.\n\nFor those early Israelite readers of Rahab’s account, they would have connected the red color of the rope “dripping” down the window frame with the lamb’s blood a previous generation had brushed on the doorframes of their homes. While still slaves in Egypt, God had passed over the houses of the Hebrews on the night the firstborn in every household in the land had died (Exodus 12:23). The blood marked those inside as belonging to God. Rahab was a Gentile and a prostitute, but she, too, would be marked as one of God’s people. Though she was late to the party, so to speak, the “blood” of the scarlet cord would bring Rahab her own Passover moment.\n\nThe symbol, of course, is not as important as the thing it symbolizes. What set Rahab apart as a member of God’s family was not the red rope but her loyalty to Yahweh, based on the reports she had heard (Joshua 2:10–11). By helping the Israelites, she was committing treason, and she knew it. By earthly measures, the people of Jericho should have been able to withstand an attack by the Israelites. Rahab could have turned the spies over to the authorities and garnered herself the favor of Jericho’s king. But she believed what she had heard about the Lord, and she gave Him her allegiance, echoing with her life what the psalmist would later write: “The LORD is my portion” (Psalm 119:57).\n\nBut the scarlet cord doesn’t just point backwards to Passover; it also points forward to Christ. It is Christ’s red blood that now marks those who are members of God’s family. The Passover account had always foreshadowed the sacrifice of Jesus, and God had always planned on making one new people from Jews and Gentiles. Rahab’s story reveals this had long been in God’s heart to do. The prostitute-turned-daughter of the King is even honored with a place in Jesus’s family tree (Matthew 1:5).\n\nGod is the Author of Scripture. No detail is included by accident. Every last one is an invitation to thank Him for His faithfulness, our God who knows the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10).\n\nJohn Greco is a writer, editor, and Bible nerd.

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Ellen L. Taylor\n\nI grew up going to church three times a week and met some of my closest friends (even to this day!) in youth group. Most of my Facebook statuses in high school were inspirational Bible verses that I hoped would encourage my friends at my public high school who weren’t believers. I went to a Christian university for my undergraduate degree, where mandatory chapel was held twice a week, and every student was required to take six semesters worth of Bible classes. I interned at a local church and even earned a minor degree in the Bible. And then, I went to graduate divinity school.\n\nBut somewhere along the way, I stopped delighting in Scripture. I saw it as something to be studied, but not something to be taken to heart. I began to think of God as something to learn about rather than someone to know. To date, this was one of the most confusing times in my life so far.\n\nAfter a time spent in this confusing season, I was given a special project at work; I was instructed to go through the entire book of Genesis, chapter by chapter, writing discussion questions along the way for kids aged eleven to fifteen.\n\nI don’t know the last time you read through the book of Genesis (maybe in January when we read it together, as an SRT community), but there are some stories in that book that are, well, a little less than age-appropriate for young teens. As I was going through some of the trickier passages, the discussion point I kept coming back to was that God keeps His promises to His people. His people keep turning away from Him, not believing Him, disobeying Him and turning to other gods, but God is consistently faithful to His promises.\n\nOne of the passages that fell into this category was the story of Sarah and her pregnancy with Isaac. When God told her she would become pregnant in her old age, Sarah laughed at the very thought (Genesis 18:9–15). But God kept His promise to her, and she bore a son (Genesis 21:1–7). After reading and working through the rest of the book of Genesis, I went into my friend’s office exasperated and frustrated with myself because I couldn’t find anything else for the discussion questions. She encouraged me to keep at it and do my best, and reassured me that maybe it was okay if God keeping His promises was the main theme of the project.\n\nSoon after completing the project, I realized that what had been frustrating me about the book of Genesis was exactly what I needed to hear and understand about God in a season of my own confusion and doubt: God keeps His promises to His people. He keeps His promises when your world seems to come crashing down. He keeps His promises when your best friend betrays you, when a dear family member falls ill, when the plans you had for your life have suddenly fallen to pieces around you. I know He does because I’ve seen it in my own life. His promises to His people are true. We can put our hope in Him to do so (Psalm 119:81). What a beautiful gift.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nHis photo was taped to my computer monitor at work and to the refrigerator door at home—a three-year-old boy with olive skin, black hair, deep brown eyes, and a dimple above each cheek. He was a child of God with no earthly mama or baba to call his own, and I wanted so badly for him to be ours.\n\nI’ve said that adoption feels as miraculous as childbirth, a million little pieces that must fall perfectly into place for that blessed homecoming to occur. It seemed all but impossible in the beginning—too much paperwork, too much money, too many unknowns. And then there was his heart. This image-bearer was created by God with a very special heart, one that somehow managed to channel blood throughout his small frame despite missing some very important vessels. He’s been a miracle from the start.\n\nSomewhere in those early days of wondering if this beautiful, brokenhearted boy could be our son, I read a passage from Isaiah 41 that made my own heart beat loud and fast.\n\n“I am the LORD, the God of Israel. I will not abandon them…I will open rivers on the barren heights, and springs in the middle of the plains.I will turn the desert into a pool and dry land into springs…So that all may see and know, consider and understand,that the hand of the LORD has done this,the Holy One of Israel has created it” (Isaiah 41:17–18,20).\n\nI taped those words to my computer monitor, right next to that dimpled smile. It was a promise from God to His people, and it became my prayer in the joy and hope and helplessness of the days and months ahead.\n\nLord, do what we cannot. Be who we cannot. Create vessels where there are none, and a road home for this boy of ours, if indeed he’s ours. Create what only you can create, as only You can. May all who see it know that You and You alone bring life and hope.\n\nPsalm 119:89 says that God’s Word is forever, “firmly fixed in heaven.” But the concept of an unbreakable thing is difficult to understand when you yourself are broken. The idea that something lasts forever feels like fiction when the world we live in is filled with people, places, and promises that fade. But God’s Word is both unbreakable and everlasting. Tethering my heart to it changes the way I walk through this wounded, temporary world. So, I grabbed hold of that Isaiah passage, and I still haven’t let it go.\n\nOur son did come home, despite all the obstacles. And after his first heart catheterization here, the surgeon showed us images we’d prayed for, but never dreamed we’d see: vessels where there once were none, tangible hope created from nothing. But would God have been good if that catheterization had found nothing new, no surgical path forward? A resounding, Yes. Because our hope is not in healed hearts or an oasis planted in the desert; our hope is in the One who speaks arteries and myrtle trees into existence, whose Word never fades or fails, even when our bodies most certainly will.\n\nThose verses I stared at day after day in that season—the same ones I clung to by his hospital bed in the year that followed—do not guarantee an outcome. They guarantee God’s goodness. He is bigger than outcomes, even when our circumstances shift and our hearts ache. We can trust the God who makes all things new.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Ryan Myers\n\n“Okay. What have you learned from this?”\n\nThis phrase, spoken by my father, was a mainstay of my growing up. I heard it one summer afternoon when I was eight years old, following my sheepish confession that I’d accidentally shot my neighbor, Mr. Horner, with my BB gun. I heard it late one snowy Michigan night, when my car came to rest against a chain-link fence—after I’d impatiently tried (unsuccessfully) to maneuver it between a ditch and another parked car in my girlfriend’s driveway—resulting in a phone call to my dad, asking him to come help me dig my car out of a snowdrift. And I’ve uttered that same question to myself countless times since, even as I’ve grown older and the learning opportunities have evolved with time and age.\n\nAlways spoken in love, and almost always received with humility, it’s a phrase so simple, yet it resounds with the essence of the relationship between a dad and a son. I’m deeply grateful to fall into the increasingly receding percentage of men whose fathers are truly fatherly.\n\nWe might not expect to find such a rare, human moment between father and son within Scripture. While God’s Word is relatable and relevant across time, I still struggle sometimes to grasp the idea that these words were written to real people who existed in a real time and place. But that wasn’t the case for me when I read David’s words to his son, Solomon, in 1 Chronicles 28. His words could’ve just as easily been written to me in a text message from my dad on any given Monday morning:\n\n“As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father,and serve him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind,for the LORD searches every heart and understands the intention of every thought.If you seek him, he will be found by you” (v.9).\n\nI can almost picture the memories and hard-won lessons flashing before David’s eyes as he distills his life into just two simple sentences, passing down parting wisdom to his son. After charging Solomon with the great responsibility of building the temple and outlining the requirements of the job, David’s parting words to his son, and some of his last we read in the Bible, include loving encouragement that ultimately points Solomon to a present, secure, steadfast God. He tells Solomon to “be strong and courageous, and do the work… for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He won’t leave you or abandon you until all the work for the service of the LORD’s house is finished” (v.20).\n\nWhat a delight it is to be offered wisdom by those who’ve come before us, and in turn, to offer guidance to those who will come after us. But isn’t that what this entire book, the Bible, is about? It’s a lamp to lead our feet along the path of life (Psalm 119:105). It gives guidance from a loving Father through stories of His own and others’ that are full of grace and love, that shape us and call us to grow. May we honor the same Father of David and Solomon, feel loved by Him, and love like Him every day.\n\nRyan Myers is Chief Operating Officer of She Reads Truth, He Reads Truth, and Kids Read Truth.

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nReading the Bible has always been hard for me. That may sound strange coming from someone who works for a company with the motto, “Women in the Word of God every day.” Over the years, being in the Word has proved tricky for several reasons, one of which is its familiarity. I’ve read Scripture my whole life, yet the transformative stories and commands lose their potency when I grow used to their rhythms and cadence, to the way the words sound when they roll off my tongue.\n\nLet me be clear: Scripture can’t lose its power or potency. But I can diminish its work in my life through my own apathy. I can choose not to slow down and really open myself to the text or the Holy Spirit who speaks through it.\n\nA decade ago, I walked through a situation that required me to love a friend and leader in our church community with what the Bible calls agape love—a love that seeks someone else’s wellbeing. Since I could no longer speak with this person directly, the development of this love had to take place solely between God and me. So, my best friend and I made a pact to read 1 Corinthians 13 every day for a whole year. The love passage. This well-known chapter was the best model we could find for the altruistic, Christlike, agape kind of love.\n\nJust because it was a well-known chapter didn’t mean it was easy to put into action. By focusing our attention on one passage for an extended period of time, the purpose was long-term, personal transformation. I began reading it to myself out loud, as if to absorb into my very being. I can still hear the lines echoing through my car, as I read it aloud each morning:\n\n“Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not envy,is not boastful, is not arrogant, is not rude,is not self-seeking, is not irritable,and does not keep a record of wrongs” (1 Corinthians 13:4–5).\n\nThese aren’t just eloquent lines of verse or truisms to tuck away in our back pocket. They’re the living, active words of God. My friend and I didn’t set out to memorize the chapter, but within a couple weeks it was buried inside us. I found that my heart had been softened toward God’s Word and toward this person from our community. And even though it may not have redeemed the situation, it changed my heart.\n\nAs Psalm 119 says, “Your decrees are wondrous; therefore I obey them” (v.129). Let’s obey God’s decrees by burying them inside us, even if that means reciting them aloud for 365 days. When our hearts have a chance to catch up with our minds, we begin to embody truth and become not a clanging cymbal but a transformed child of God (1Corinthians 13:1).\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kara Gause\n\nIt was the first time I’d ever stood up in front of our church congregation, some fifteen years ago. Alongside our fellow “new members,” my husband and I looked out over the church body we were joining, as our pastor read our favorite Bible verses aloud and introduced us by name. Never one to go first, I listened from the end of the line as one inspirational verse after another was read into the microphone, each one offering another shade of affirmation, encouragement, and faith. But as I listened for the first time to the verses of other new congregants, I felt panic set in: Had I misunderstood the instruction? The sound of my blood pumping in my ears grew louder, nearly drowning out my pastor’s voice completely, until my husband gently squeezed my hand to hear my own “favorite verse” from Scripture:\n\n“There is nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work.I have seen that even this is from God’s hand,because who can eat and who can enjoy life apart from him?” (Ecclesiastes 2:24–25).\n\nYup.\n\nIn all of Scripture, with its sweeping poetry and prose, that was “my verse”—is my verse, I should say. In that moment of pride, I began to doubt my seemingly simple choice. I was afraid that, out of context, it misrepresented my faith and understanding of the gospel and downplayed my affection for God. I’ve since come to realize just how accurately it still reflects my relationship with Him and the sin that so often distracts me from Him: my heart’s unfortunate tendency to wander.\n\nI’m easily distracted, you see. By work. By striving. By perfectionism of the textbook-definition variety. And when I get caught up in working and worrying, spinning myself into a cycle that pushes God away from the center of my heart’s affections—that’s when He reminds me of what’s true. He gently squeezes my heart in such a way that I’m forced to acknowledge the emptiness I’m feeling, the deep ache I work so hard to numb with the distraction of productivity, when I try to live my life with my gaze affixed on anyone or anything “apart from him” (John 15:5).\n\nThe Westminster Shorter Catechism posits that “the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.” In my own walk with God, I’ve tended to focus on the first part, on what it might mean to glorify Him. I’ve twisted the idea of bearing His image into a works-based, legalistic, shallow religion that has very little to do with my God.\n\nBut to enjoy Him. To be satisfied in Him. To delight in His Word. To stop and savor His provision and the work He’s called me to, not just for what they might become in the future, but for what they are today—well, that sings of enjoying relationship with my very relational God, the one who is ready to answer when we call out to Him, when we seek Him with all our heart (Psalm 119:145). His Word is a very precious gift that instructs us on how to best live this life He’s given us (v.153). And it is clear: in knowing Him, being in His presence, there is abundant joy and eternal pleasure. But apart from Him, we will never be satisfied (Psalm 16:11). This is the instruction my wandering heart so desperately needs.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nChristians don’t just read the Bible. We enter into a life-long relationship with it. We read it over the course of a lifetime, knowing we will never exhaust all there is to know or glean from God’s Word. Often, when we return to passages we’ve read before, we come to them having changed since the last time we spent time with those verses. We go through things that shift how we see the world—vocational upheaval, marriage, divorce, parenthood, miscarriage, life-altering diagnoses, unexpected windfalls of good-fortune, and the like.\n\nAs we experience more of the joys and heartaches associated with living in this world, we look at Scripture through different eyes. Sometimes a theological idea we thought we had wrapped up in a tidy bow suddenly becomes shot through with questions we never thought to ask when we were younger and had not suffered much.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I am so drawn to the story of Peter’s reinstatement in John 21:1–19. Here we find Simon Peter, who was one of Jesus’s closest friends, sitting with the fact that he had denied Jesus in His greatest hour of need. He had done so exactly as Jesus predicted he would, even though he swore this sort of failure wasn’t something he was capable of (Mark 14:31).\n\nI love the story because it’s about someone who appeared to have as good of a relationship with Jesus as anyone could have, and yet he himself was weak. When Jesus appeared on the shore cooking breakfast for His friends, and caused their empty nets to be filled with more fish than they could handle, Peter recognized Jesus, because this is the same way Jesus first called Peter—with a miraculous catch of fish (Luke 5:1–11).\n\nWhen Peter jumped out of the boat and cast his drenched and dripping self at the feet of Jesus, he had no relational ground to stand on. He’d betrayed his best friend, his Lord. And yet, Jesus asked Peter the most simple and searching question imaginable: “Do you love me?” And Peter, paradox that he is, answered truthfully. He did love Jesus. He did. When Jesus said, “Feed my sheep,” He was hearkening back to when He first called Peter and told him He would make him a fisher of men. Peter’s failure did not disqualify him from Jesus’s love, or from Jesus’s call on his life.\n\nI love this passage because it offers so much hope to people who go through seasons of struggle and failure and wonder if they have lost the love of God. Peter could do nothing but receive from Jesus. On that shore, he had nothing to offer. And yet, he longed to be near his Lord and friend. We know this because earlier, before Jesus was crucified, He taught that people would ultimately need to be nourished by His flesh and blood. It was a teaching many found too difficult to embrace, and they left. But when Jesus asked His disciples if they, too, would leave, it was Peter who said, “Lord, to whom will we go? You have the words of eternal life” (John 6:68).\n\nPeter’s story reminds us that the thing we must cling to most, and fear above all else, is the Word of Christ (Psalm 119:161). Though our circumstances change, and even we change, He does not (Hebrews 13:8). Where else can we go?\n\nRuss Ramsey and his wife and four children make their home in Nashville, Tennessee, where he is the pastor of Christ Presbyterian Church Cool Springs.

I remember enthusiastically singing the Ten-Commandments song “The Perfect Ten” at school and church with the confidence of a child whose Christian walk was just beginning.\n\nNumber one, we’ve just begun: God should be first in your life!Number two’s the idol rule: those graven images aren’t nice.\n\nI’d assure myself as I sang…\n\nNumber three: God’s name should be never spoken in jest.Number four: the Sabbath’s for our worship and for rest.\n\nSo far, so good. Our family was known for nothing if not for our Sunday naps.\n\nNumber five: we all should strive to honor father and mother.Number six: don’t get your kicks from killing one another.\n\nSuccess!\n\nNumber seven: life is heaven when you’re true to your mate.Number eight: don’t steal and break this rule for goodness’ sake!\n\nNumber seven was easy—I didn’t even have a mate!\n\nNumber nine: don’t be the kind who goes around telling lies.Number ten: don’t covet when you see your neighbor’s house or wife!\n\nI was doing so well. It had never occurred to me to covet my neighbor’s wife. In my mind I would sing that song with a full band playing behind me—like a victory song. I was delighting in God’s law because it was just so keepable! But as I grew to understand the law, I began to understand how difficult it was to follow.\n\nI thank God that He brought me out of the age of check, check, check into the maturity of, If this is the measuring stick, I will never measure up. And even more, I’m thankful He didn’t leave me there with my checklist. When God mercifully, gradually granted me eyes to see how readily I broke His law by commission, omission, and flat-out rejection of Him, the big band musicians in my head began to slowly lower their instruments and solemnly take their seats. I wasn’t delighting in God’s law at all. I had been delighting in my “keeping” of His law.\n\nBut my delight hasn’t gone away; it has instead shifted and matured. Now, my soul finds rest in knowing that the law has been fulfilled by Christ on my behalf. Because of Jesus, the law no longer justifies or condemns us—it frees us and becomes our guide for thankful obedience to the One by whom we are justified.\n\nDo you get that? If the law is our measuring stick, every one of us will be found unrighteous. But Jesus kept God’s law perfectly, imparting His righteousness to us so that when we are measured, we, too, will be counted as righteous—as perfect law-keepers!\n\nNow, when I catch myself humming that childhood ten commandments tune (or teaching it to my children), I hear it differently. Not as a reminder of what I have to do, or even as a condemnation of what I can’t do. I hear it now as an assurance of what He has done, and as the kindest, clearest roadmap to the heart of the Father. He makes me righteous, and I delight in pleasing Him. “Oh that my ways may be steadfast in keeping [His] statutes!” (Psalm 119:5, ESV).\n\nLord, I love your law. “With my lips I declare all the rules of your mouth” (v.13, ESV).\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nIn her essay called “The Wreck of Time,” Annie Dillard references the idea that when a single person dies, we treat it as a tragedy. But when a million people die, we treat it as a statistic.\n\nThis unsettling observation shows how inconsistent we humans can be concerning the value of a life. On the one hand, if a friend or relative or some other cherished person is taken from us, we are moved to deep and abiding sorrow. On the other hand, if a million lives with whom we share no personal connection are suddenly wiped out by a viral pandemic or natural disaster, any initial sadness and shock we feel can fade within weeks, and possibly within hours. The one who is close to us seems more precious even than the million who are further away.\n\nOur selective valuation of our fellow humans invites a haunting question: If the million don’t matter to us as much as the one, then can we honestly say that the one really matters at all? How precious are many lives, how precious is a single life, and how precious is my life… really?\n\nEach of us living today is one in seven billion. Of all the people who have ever lived, we are one in 107 billion. David hinted at this relative smallness of ours when he cried out to God, “What is a human being that you remember him, a son of man that you look after him?” (Psalm 8:4).\n\nThankfully, Scripture provides us with a strong and sure answer. David continued, “You made him a little less than God and crowned him with glory and honor” (v.5). The poet-king after God’s own heart is genuinely awestruck by the truth about all humans and about each individual human: We are made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). Of all creatures everywhere, only humans are esteemed in this way.\n\nThis truth about our inestimable value becomes even more compelling when we realize that in Christ, we are the image of God but also much more: Scripture tells us we are the children of God. And as His children, He gives us life through His Word and teaches us His ways (Psalm 119:25–26). In his letter to the Galatians, Paul amplifies this astonishing truth by reminding us that through faith in Christ, God has adopted us, sent His Spirit into our hearts, invited us to call Him “Father,” and made us heirs of all that is His (Galatians 4:4–7).\n\nAs Brennan Manning has written, “Define yourself radically as one beloved by God. This is the true self. Every other identity is an illusion.”\n\nThe next time you look in the mirror, don’t for a moment think that you’re looking at a mere face in the crowd. Don’t for a moment think that you’re looking at a tragedy or a statistic. You have no true basis for looking at yourself in this way. Rather, you are looking at an esteemed crown of God’s creation, a beloved child of God, and a privileged heir of everything.\n\nThis is your true self. Every other identity is an illusion.\n\nScott Sauls is husband to Patti, dad to Abby and Ellie, and senior pastor of Christ Presbyterian Church in Nashville, Tennessee.

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jessica Lamb\n\nOne of my strongest memories from my sophomore year of high school is of a black, 5-inch thick three-ring binder I carried everywhere. I was part of the not-so-exclusive academic quiz bowl team at my school, and every few weeks, I would compete against other schools to see which team could “buzz in” first to earn points answering trivia questions. My binder was filled with the printed records of previous tournament questions and answers. Though questions were rarely repeated, I poured over that binder every opportunity I could find, hoping that my incessant studying might reveal recurring subject matter or a pattern in how questions are worded for tournaments to give me an edge over the competition. To this day, I’d still choose a trivia night at a local restaurant over almost any other activity.\n\nI used to think taking this same approach to Scripture was proof that I loved God’s Word. Studying the Bible—its words, history, cultural contexts, and languages—has been life-giving to my faith in my undergraduate and postgraduate studies, as well as in my career. But I have to be reminded that life as a follower of Jesus is so much more than just memorizing facts about God or storing up interesting trivia about the Bible. Our reading and study of Scripture should shape us and reorient our hearts as it shows us who He is and who we are in Him.\n\nI come back to the book of James over and over when I find my heart wanting to make a god of knowing about God, rather than truly knowing Him. The book is full of direct one-liners that cut right to the truth: truly delighting in God’s Word means living out what the Word teaches us. In the opening passage of his letter, James sums this up by telling believers that we must be “doers of the word and not hearers only” (James 1:22).\n\nHearing without acting is more than useless—it’s self-deception, because as believers, we are new people born of the gospel (v.22,18). James writes that God has implanted His Word in us (v.21). We miss the point if we are not willing to let its truth take root, growing and bearing fruit in us as we are changed and made more like Christ.\n\nEssentially, we are living out what the psalmist pleads with God to do: transform him so that he can keep God’s commands. By His Spirit and His Word, we’ve been made into new people. Unlike the person who looks in the mirror and responds, “I forget,” when asked what they look like (vv.23–24), we are called to remember who we are as we walk away from reading the Bible. If we go about our lives without acting on what it teaches, we live as fractured people, at odds with who we now are in Christ. Praise God, because He’s done the hardest work in giving us new hearts already!\n\nBeing in the Word of God every day equips us to live out the Word of God every day. It guards against forgetting what is true of our God and of ourselves. Let our prayer echo that of the psalmist as we come to the Bible each day: ”Teach me, LORD, the meaning of your statutes, and I will always keep them” (Psalm 119:33).\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nI remember listening to journalist Malcolm Gladwell interview Nashville legend and famed songwriter Bobby Braddock. Their conversation centered on what goes into writing a truly sad song, the kind of tune that finds you driving with one hand on the steering wheel so the other can be free to wipe the tears from your eyes.\n\nAs they talked, they decided that country music has a leg up on rock and pop when it comes to mournful tracks, but the question that lingered was Why? In the end, Braddock said it came down to details: “We cry when melancholy collides with specificity.” It’s one thing to sing about heartache, and another thing entirely to sing about standing by a lost friend’s grave and the angels’ faces delighting to welcome that friend home. Take a listen to “Go Rest High on That Mountain” by Vince Gill to hear what I’m talking about.\n\nThe reason that details help sad songs resonate with us is because they echo our own experience. We live in a world of details, not generalities. Somehow, the details make a thing more real. When it comes to God’s Word, I delight in the details. You see, in the ancient world, there was no paper. Instead, texts were written on papyrus, a material similar to paper but made out of certain flattened reeds—and papyrus wasn’t cheap. That means that everything included in God’s Word is important. There are no throwaway lines, no unimportant details.\n\nIn the story of Rahab, there’s a detail that jumps off the page for me. When she lets the two Israelite spies down through her window, she does so with a “scarlet cord” (Joshua 2:18). And it was this scarlet cord that would identify her home and keep her safe when the Israelites later attacked Jericho. It wasn’t brown or blue or white. It was a scarlet rope—and that makes all the difference in telling this story.\n\nFor those early Israelite readers of Rahab’s account, they would have connected the red color of the rope “dripping” down the window frame with the lamb’s blood a previous generation had brushed on the doorframes of their homes. While still slaves in Egypt, God had passed over the houses of the Hebrews on the night the firstborn in every household in the land had died (Exodus 12:23). The blood marked those inside as belonging to God. Rahab was a Gentile and a prostitute, but she, too, would be marked as one of God’s people. Though she was late to the party, so to speak, the “blood” of the scarlet cord would bring Rahab her own Passover moment.\n\nThe symbol, of course, is not as important as the thing it symbolizes. What set Rahab apart as a member of God’s family was not the red rope but her loyalty to Yahweh, based on the reports she had heard (Joshua 2:10–11). By helping the Israelites, she was committing treason, and she knew it. By earthly measures, the people of Jericho should have been able to withstand an attack by the Israelites. Rahab could have turned the spies over to the authorities and garnered herself the favor of Jericho’s king. But she believed what she had heard about the Lord, and she gave Him her allegiance, echoing with her life what the psalmist would later write: “The LORD is my portion” (Psalm 119:57).\n\nBut the scarlet cord doesn’t just point backwards to Passover; it also points forward to Christ. It is Christ’s red blood that now marks those who are members of God’s family. The Passover account had always foreshadowed the sacrifice of Jesus, and God had always planned on making one new people from Jews and Gentiles. Rahab’s story reveals this had long been in God’s heart to do. The prostitute-turned-daughter of the King is even honored with a place in Jesus’s family tree (Matthew 1:5).\n\nGod is the Author of Scripture. No detail is included by accident. Every last one is an invitation to thank Him for His faithfulness, our God who knows the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10).\n\nJohn Greco is a writer, editor, and Bible nerd.

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Ellen L. Taylor\n\nI grew up going to church three times a week and met some of my closest friends (even to this day!) in youth group. Most of my Facebook statuses in high school were inspirational Bible verses that I hoped would encourage my friends at my public high school who weren’t believers. I went to a Christian university for my undergraduate degree, where mandatory chapel was held twice a week, and every student was required to take six semesters worth of Bible classes. I interned at a local church and even earned a minor degree in the Bible. And then, I went to graduate divinity school.\n\nBut somewhere along the way, I stopped delighting in Scripture. I saw it as something to be studied, but not something to be taken to heart. I began to think of God as something to learn about rather than someone to know. To date, this was one of the most confusing times in my life so far.\n\nAfter a time spent in this confusing season, I was given a special project at work; I was instructed to go through the entire book of Genesis, chapter by chapter, writing discussion questions along the way for kids aged eleven to fifteen.\n\nI don’t know the last time you read through the book of Genesis (maybe in January when we read it together, as an SRT community), but there are some stories in that book that are, well, a little less than age-appropriate for young teens. As I was going through some of the trickier passages, the discussion point I kept coming back to was that God keeps His promises to His people. His people keep turning away from Him, not believing Him, disobeying Him and turning to other gods, but God is consistently faithful to His promises.\n\nOne of the passages that fell into this category was the story of Sarah and her pregnancy with Isaac. When God told her she would become pregnant in her old age, Sarah laughed at the very thought (Genesis 18:9–15). But God kept His promise to her, and she bore a son (Genesis 21:1–7). After reading and working through the rest of the book of Genesis, I went into my friend’s office exasperated and frustrated with myself because I couldn’t find anything else for the discussion questions. She encouraged me to keep at it and do my best, and reassured me that maybe it was okay if God keeping His promises was the main theme of the project.\n\nSoon after completing the project, I realized that what had been frustrating me about the book of Genesis was exactly what I needed to hear and understand about God in a season of my own confusion and doubt: God keeps His promises to His people. He keeps His promises when your world seems to come crashing down. He keeps His promises when your best friend betrays you, when a dear family member falls ill, when the plans you had for your life have suddenly fallen to pieces around you. I know He does because I’ve seen it in my own life. His promises to His people are true. We can put our hope in Him to do so (Psalm 119:81). What a beautiful gift.\n\n",

He was a child of God with no earthly mama or baba to call his own, and I wanted so badly for him to be ours.\n\nI’ve said that adoption feels as miraculous as childbirth, a million little pieces that must fall perfectly into place for that blessed homecoming to occur. It seemed all but impossible in the beginning—too much paperwork, too much money, too many unknowns. And then there was his heart. This image-bearer was created by God with a very special heart, one that somehow managed to channel blood throughout his small frame despite missing some very important vessels. He’s been a miracle from the start.\n\nSomewhere in those early days of wondering if this beautiful, brokenhearted boy could be our son, I read a passage from Isaiah 41 that made my own heart beat loud and fast.\n\n“I am the LORD, the God of Israel. I will not abandon them…I will open rivers on the barren heights, and springs in the middle of the plains.I will turn the desert into a pool and dry land into springs…So that all may see and know, consider and understand,that the hand of the LORD has done this,the Holy One of Israel has created it” (Isaiah 41:17–18,20).\n\nI taped those words to my computer monitor, right next to that dimpled smile. It was a promise from God to His people, and it became my prayer in the joy and hope and helplessness of the days and months ahead.\n\nLord, do what we cannot. Be who we cannot. Create vessels where there are none, and a road home for this boy of ours, if indeed he’s ours. Create what only you can create, as only You can. May all who see it know that You and You alone bring life and hope.\n\nPsalm 119:89 says that God’s Word is forever, “firmly fixed in heaven.” But the concept of an unbreakable thing is difficult to understand when you yourself are broken. The idea that something lasts forever feels like fiction when the world we live in is filled with people, places, and promises that fade. But God’s Word is both unbreakable and everlasting. Tethering my heart to it changes the way I walk through this wounded, temporary world. So, I grabbed hold of that Isaiah passage, and I still haven’t let it go.\n\nOur son did come home, despite all the obstacles. And after his first heart catheterization here, the surgeon showed us images we’d prayed for, but never dreamed we’d see: vessels where there once were none, tangible hope created from nothing. But would God have been good if that catheterization had found nothing new, no surgical path forward? A resounding, Yes. Because our hope is not in healed hearts or an oasis planted in the desert; our hope is in the One who speaks arteries and myrtle trees into existence, whose Word never fades or fails, even when our bodies most certainly will.\n\nThose verses I stared at day after day in that season—the same ones I clung to by his hospital bed in the year that followed—do not guarantee an outcome. They guarantee God’s goodness. He is bigger than outcomes, even when our circumstances shift and our hearts ache. We can trust the God who makes all things new.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Ryan Myers\n\n“Okay. What have you learned from this?”\n\nThis phrase, spoken by my father, was a mainstay of my growing up. I heard it one summer afternoon when I was eight years old, following my sheepish confession that I’d accidentally shot my neighbor, Mr. Horner, with my BB gun. I heard it late one snowy Michigan night, when my car came to rest against a chain-link fence—after I’d impatiently tried (unsuccessfully) to maneuver it between a ditch and another parked car in my girlfriend’s driveway—resulting in a phone call to my dad, asking him to come help me dig my car out of a snowdrift. And I’ve uttered that same question to myself countless times since, even as I’ve grown older and the learning opportunities have evolved with time and age.\n\nAlways spoken in love, and almost always received with humility, it’s a phrase so simple, yet it resounds with the essence of the relationship between a dad and a son. I’m deeply grateful to fall into the increasingly receding percentage of men whose fathers are truly fatherly.\n\nWe might not expect to find such a rare, human moment between father and son within Scripture. While God’s Word is relatable and relevant across time, I still struggle sometimes to grasp the idea that these words were written to real people who existed in a real time and place. But that wasn’t the case for me when I read David’s words to his son, Solomon, in 1 Chronicles 28. His words could’ve just as easily been written to me in a text message from my dad on any given Monday morning:\n\n“As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father,and serve him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind,for the LORD searches every heart and understands the intention of every thought.If you seek him, he will be found by you” (v.9).\n\nI can almost picture the memories and hard-won lessons flashing before David’s eyes as he distills his life into just two simple sentences, passing down parting wisdom to his son. After charging Solomon with the great responsibility of building the temple and outlining the requirements of the job, David’s parting words to his son, and some of his last we read in the Bible, include loving encouragement that ultimately points Solomon to a present, secure, steadfast God. He tells Solomon to “be strong and courageous, and do the work… for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He won’t leave you or abandon you until all the work for the service of the LORD’s house is finished” (v.20).\n\nWhat a delight it is to be offered wisdom by those who’ve come before us, and in turn, to offer guidance to those who will come after us. But isn’t that what this entire book, the Bible, is about? It’s a lamp to lead our feet along the path of life (Psalm 119:105). It gives guidance from a loving Father through stories of His own and others’ that are full of grace and love, that shape us and call us to grow. May we honor the same Father of David and Solomon, feel loved by Him, and love like Him every day.\n\nRyan Myers is Chief Operating Officer of She Reads Truth, He Reads Truth, and Kids Read Truth.

That may sound strange coming from someone who works for a company with the motto, “Women in the Word of God every day.” Over the years, being in the Word has proved tricky for several reasons, one of which is its familiarity. I’ve read Scripture my whole life, yet the transformative stories and commands lose their potency when I grow used to their rhythms and cadence, to the way the words sound when they roll off my tongue.\n\nLet me be clear: Scripture can’t lose its power or potency. But I can diminish its work in my life through my own apathy. I can choose not to slow down and really open myself to the text or the Holy Spirit who speaks through it.\n\nA decade ago, I walked through a situation that required me to love a friend and leader in our church community with what the Bible calls agape love—a love that seeks someone else’s wellbeing. Since I could no longer speak with this person directly, the development of this love had to take place solely between God and me. So, my best friend and I made a pact to read 1 Corinthians 13 every day for a whole year. The love passage. This well-known chapter was the best model we could find for the altruistic, Christlike, agape kind of love.\n\nJust because it was a well-known chapter didn’t mean it was easy to put into action. By focusing our attention on one passage for an extended period of time, the purpose was long-term, personal transformation. I began reading it to myself out loud, as if to absorb into my very being. I can still hear the lines echoing through my car, as I read it aloud each morning:\n\n“Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not envy,is not boastful, is not arrogant, is not rude,is not self-seeking, is not irritable,and does not keep a record of wrongs” (1 Corinthians 13:4–5).\n\nThese aren’t just eloquent lines of verse or truisms to tuck away in our back pocket. They’re the living, active words of God. My friend and I didn’t set out to memorize the chapter, but within a couple weeks it was buried inside us. I found that my heart had been softened toward God’s Word and toward this person from our community. And even though it may not have redeemed the situation, it changed my heart.\n\nAs Psalm 119 says, “Your decrees are wondrous; therefore I obey them” (v.129). Let’s obey God’s decrees by burying them inside us, even if that means reciting them aloud for 365 days. When our hearts have a chance to catch up with our minds, we begin to embody truth and become not a clanging cymbal but a transformed child of God (1Corinthians 13:1).\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kara Gause\n\nIt was the first time I’d ever stood up in front of our church congregation, some fifteen years ago. Alongside our fellow “new members,” my husband and I looked out over the church body we were joining, as our pastor read our favorite Bible verses aloud and introduced us by name. Never one to go first, I listened from the end of the line as one inspirational verse after another was read into the microphone, each one offering another shade of affirmation, encouragement, and faith. But as I listened for the first time to the verses of other new congregants, I felt panic set in: Had I misunderstood the instruction? The sound of my blood pumping in my ears grew louder, nearly drowning out my pastor’s voice completely, until my husband gently squeezed my hand to hear my own “favorite verse” from Scripture:\n\n“There is nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work.I have seen that even this is from God’s hand,because who can eat and who can enjoy life apart from him?” (Ecclesiastes 2:24–25).\n\nYup.\n\nIn all of Scripture, with its sweeping poetry and prose, that was “my verse”—is my verse, I should say. In that moment of pride, I began to doubt my seemingly simple choice. I was afraid that, out of context, it misrepresented my faith and understanding of the gospel and downplayed my affection for God. I’ve since come to realize just how accurately it still reflects my relationship with Him and the sin that so often distracts me from Him: my heart’s unfortunate tendency to wander.\n\nI’m easily distracted, you see. By work. By striving. By perfectionism of the textbook-definition variety. And when I get caught up in working and worrying, spinning myself into a cycle that pushes God away from the center of my heart’s affections—that’s when He reminds me of what’s true. He gently squeezes my heart in such a way that I’m forced to acknowledge the emptiness I’m feeling, the deep ache I work so hard to numb with the distraction of productivity, when I try to live my life with my gaze affixed on anyone or anything “apart from him” (John 15:5).\n\nThe Westminster Shorter Catechism posits that “the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.” In my own walk with God, I’ve tended to focus on the first part, on what it might mean to glorify Him. I’ve twisted the idea of bearing His image into a works-based, legalistic, shallow religion that has very little to do with my God.\n\nBut to enjoy Him. To be satisfied in Him. To delight in His Word. To stop and savor His provision and the work He’s called me to, not just for what they might become in the future, but for what they are today—well, that sings of enjoying relationship with my very relational God, the one who is ready to answer when we call out to Him, when we seek Him with all our heart (Psalm 119:145). His Word is a very precious gift that instructs us on how to best live this life He’s given us (v.153). And it is clear: in knowing Him, being in His presence, there is abundant joy and eternal pleasure. But apart from Him, we will never be satisfied (Psalm 16:11). This is the instruction my wandering heart so desperately needs.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nChristians don’t just read the Bible. We enter into a life-long relationship with it. We read it over the course of a lifetime, knowing we will never exhaust all there is to know or glean from God’s Word. Often, when we return to passages we’ve read before, we come to them having changed since the last time we spent time with those verses. We go through things that shift how we see the world—vocational upheaval, marriage, divorce, parenthood, miscarriage, life-altering diagnoses, unexpected windfalls of good-fortune, and the like.\n\nAs we experience more of the joys and heartaches associated with living in this world, we look at Scripture through different eyes. Sometimes a theological idea we thought we had wrapped up in a tidy bow suddenly becomes shot through with questions we never thought to ask when we were younger and had not suffered much.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I am so drawn to the story of Peter’s reinstatement in John 21:1–19. Here we find Simon Peter, who was one of Jesus’s closest friends, sitting with the fact that he had denied Jesus in His greatest hour of need. He had done so exactly as Jesus predicted he would, even though he swore this sort of failure wasn’t something he was capable of (Mark 14:31).\n\nI love the story because it’s about someone who appeared to have as good of a relationship with Jesus as anyone could have, and yet he himself was weak. When Jesus appeared on the shore cooking breakfast for His friends, and caused their empty nets to be filled with more fish than they could handle, Peter recognized Jesus, because this is the same way Jesus first called Peter—with a miraculous catch of fish (Luke 5:1–11).\n\nWhen Peter jumped out of the boat and cast his drenched and dripping self at the feet of Jesus, he had no relational ground to stand on. He’d betrayed his best friend, his Lord. And yet, Jesus asked Peter the most simple and searching question imaginable: “Do you love me?” And Peter, paradox that he is, answered truthfully. He did love Jesus. He did. When Jesus said, “Feed my sheep,” He was hearkening back to when He first called Peter and told him He would make him a fisher of men. Peter’s failure did not disqualify him from Jesus’s love, or from Jesus’s call on his life.\n\nI love this passage because it offers so much hope to people who go through seasons of struggle and failure and wonder if they have lost the love of God. Peter could do nothing but receive from Jesus. On that shore, he had nothing to offer. And yet, he longed to be near his Lord and friend. We know this because earlier, before Jesus was crucified, He taught that people would ultimately need to be nourished by His flesh and blood. It was a teaching many found too difficult to embrace, and they left. But when Jesus asked His disciples if they, too, would leave, it was Peter who said, “Lord, to whom will we go? You have the words of eternal life” (John 6:68).\n\nPeter’s story reminds us that the thing we must cling to most, and fear above all else, is the Word of Christ (Psalm 119:161). Though our circumstances change, and even we change, He does not (Hebrews 13:8). Where else can we go?\n\nRuss Ramsey and his wife and four children make their home in Nashville, Tennessee, where he is the pastor of Christ Presbyterian Church Cool Springs.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nJesus in 500 words or less. Is that even possible? After all, the apostle John ended his Gospel by stating that the world is not big enough for all the books that could be written about this man, Jesus Christ of Nazareth (John 21:25). And if John says it can’t be done, who am I to try?\n\nThe daunting task reminds me of those blue test booklets in school, the ones designed to hold handwritten answers to essay questions, paragraph after painful paragraph to prove how much we did—or didn’t—know about the subject at hand. I love words and I liked school, but even I hated those blue booklets. They symbolized a reckoning none of us could escape, the teacher acting as the sole judge of whether our finite knowledge was enough.\n\n“Who do you say that I am?” (Matthew 16:15). Jesus quizzed His disciples after yet another encounter with the religious leaders who were constantly trying to corner Him, embarrass Him, and discredit Him. But His question isn’t only for the Twelve; it’s also for us.\n\nWho is Jesus? He is God incarnate, the very fullness of God in the form of a man. John described Him this way: “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). Jesus was present at creation when the earth was formed and the first man and woman were made in the image of God. “He was with God in the beginning,” John writes. “All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created” (John 1:2–3).\n\nNot one thing was created apart from Jesus. “He is before all things, and by him all things hold together” (Colossians 1:17). And yet, Jesus came to walk the very earth He formed, becoming a real human being who talked and laughed and ate breakfast and felt physical pain. He came to dwell among us—to live and die and rise again as the Savior of the world.\n\nWho is Jesus? God the Father answered the question as His only Son stood high on a mountain, three of His friends beside Him and two ancient fathers of the faith looking on. “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased” (Matthew 17:5). God then followed that statement with a not-so-subtle command: “Listen to him!”\n\nWho is Jesus? He is the Son of God who reveals the Father, full of grace and truth (John 1:18). He is the Lamb of God who fulfilled the law we could not keep and took the punishment for our sins on Himself (Romans 8:3–4). He is the risen Savior who reconciles us to God and gives us peace (Colossians 1:19–20).\n\nAll of Scripture points to Jesus. Every story is about Him. And though we may not be able to explain this reality in any number of blue test booklets, we can know it in our bones all the same. As we read the stories of women and men in the New Testament, I pray that we see Jesus. May we stand with Peter and profess: “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God” (Matthew 16:16).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nIn our broken condition, even mustard-seed faith is often hard to muster. Take Zechariah, for example. In the first chapter of his Gospel, Luke records that Zechariah had many reasons to trust God. He came from a family of priests who had served God for generations. Surely, the stories of God’s faithfulness had trickled down through Zechariah’s family line. Or maybe through the line of his wife, Elizabeth, who was also from the line of Aaron.\n\nAaron—Who was Israel’s first high priest (Numbers 17:8–18:1).Whose feet had felt the dry sand at the bottom of the Red Sea (Exodus 14:15–31).Who tasted manna with his own taste buds (Exodus 16).Who entered the holy of holies and saw God appear in a cloud above the mercy seat (Leviticus 16:2–3).\n\nWhat stories of God might they have heard?\n\nZechariah was a praying man who had asked the Lord for a child, and Scripture tells us God heard that prayer (Luke 1:13). Since Zechariah and his wife were “well along in years” (v.18), we can assume they had been praying for a long time, likely decades. Hadn’t Zechariah kept praying in faith? Hadn’t he asked, expecting God to respond? Luke reveals that as Zechariah entered the temple to offer the incense offering, “the whole assembly of the people was praying outside” (v.10). Was his faith strengthened by the image of an entire assembly seeking the Lord?\n\nWith a heritage of faith, a history of God’s faithfulness, and the prayers of the people ringing in his ears, you’d think that trusting God would come naturally to Zechariah. Except, of course, it didn’t in this moment. When Gabriel announced that God heard Zechariah’s prayers and was about to do all that Zechariah asked and more, Zechariah replied, “How can I know this?” (v.18). From my own human experience, what I hear in his words is this: “How can I know for sure?” It seems Zechariah was overcome with doubt, not faith. Though he had so many reasons to stand tall on his trust in God, the legs of Zechariah’s faith wobbled. The angel struck him mute as a result (vv.19–20).\n\nBecause our hearts are still bruised from the fall, unwavering faith is hard won. Despite all that God has given us, do you, like Zechariah, still doubt that He will come through? Me too. When my need leads me to the intersection of fear and faith, I look at God’s promises and think, How can I know for sure?\n\nLean in. Listen to the angel’s answer.\n\n“You will become silent and unable to speak until the days these things take place,because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time” (v.20).\n\nThough God certainly calls us to trust Him, we can read Zechariah’s story and find hope. Zechariah’s weak faith did not weaken God’s power. His doubt didn’t stop John, the forerunner to Jesus, from being born. When your own legs of faith start to wobble, take courage, because nothing can stop the plans of God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Ellen L. Taylor\n\nWhen I was young, my church put on a Christmas pageant every year. At age 8, I was given the extreme honor of performing a solo for that year’s pageant. My shining moment came as Mary and Joseph were traveling to Bethlehem, looking for somewhere safe to stay so Mary could give birth to Jesus. As Mary and Joseph came upon the inn my character was “working” at, I burst into song, repeating over and over, “No room. No room.”\n\nThat’s it. “No room.” My twenty seconds of fame. (Twenty might be generous.)\n\nThis follows the story I learned about Mary growing up: She is visited by an angel and told she will give birth to Jesus. She is afraid Joseph, her fiancé, will leave her, but he is visited by an angel too! They travel on a donkey to Bethlehem for a census, and while they are there, the time comes for Mary to give birth. But there isn’t anywhere for them to stay! (Time for my solo—“No room. No room.”) And so when Jesus is born, He is laid in a manger, a food trough for animals. He grows up, and that’s when the story really begins.\n\nFor the most part, this was all I’d really learned about Mary. But one of the best parts of Mary’s story actually comes at the very beginning, when she is first visited by the angel. When the angel tells her she will be the mother of Jesus, God’s own Son, she is quick to question, ”How can this be, since I have not had sexual relations with a man?” (Luke 1:34). Mary was likely confused and concerned, given her engagement to Joseph, as any young woman would be upon receiving such news. But the angel counters her confusion and fear with a reminder of the power of the Lord her God. He tells Mary that the child she is carrying will be called the Son of God. And then he reminds her of her cousin Elizabeth, and the son she is now carrying after years of infertility. Nothing is impossible with God.\n\nMary’s response to the angel is simple and powerful: “I am the Lord’s servant… May it happen to me as you have said” (Luke 1:38). Before Jesus was even born, His mother was committed to being a servant of the Lord. Even though her life was being turned upside down, her own plans disrupted, and she was unsure of the future she thought she would have with Joseph, one thing remained true: she was a servant of the Lord. And because she trusted in the Lord, she knew that His plans for her life were better than the ones she had herself.\n\nIn moments of uncertainty, when we’re told that something will likely turn our life upside down, we may try to cope with it by hanging on to whatever sense of control we think we have at that time. We try to keep a tight, white-knuckled grip on what we think we know to be best for us; those are easy reactions that offer a false sense of security. But Mary does the exact opposite—she lets go. And with open hands she gives herself to God’s plan.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nKeeping promises is tricky business. We like the concept. But sticking to our word can prove a bit more difficult. As kids, we try setting ourselves up for a better success rate by creating failsafes, like the infamous “pinky promise.” Because, as everyone knows, if it’s a pinky promise, it can’t be broken.\n\nI know some people who are really good at keeping their word. Their promises aren’t unrealistic because they recognize their own limits, but the ones they do make are meant to make a difference. I promise to support you in any way I can. I promise to hold you accountable. I promise to let you know if there’s anything you can do for me. These statements reflect more about the person’s commitment than their ability to carry it out. After all, even the best of friends can’t keep a perfect record.\n\nSimeon’s story is a beautiful account of someone who not only received a very personal promise from God, but also had the joy of seeing it fulfilled during his lifetime. He is depicted as a sort of spiritual elder, being ”righteous and devout” and “looking forward to Israel’s consolation” (Luke 2:25). With tenderness, we see Simeon take the object of his affection into his arms and say to the Lord, “You can dismiss your servant in peace, as you promised. For my eyes have seen your salvation” (vv.29–30). He was one of the first to recognize Jesus for who He really was.\n\nCan you imagine the joy, as well as the relief? The Holy Spirit’s promise was that Simeon would pass away only after seeing the Messiah, and he responded to this promise with trust (v.26). Although seeing the Messiah with his own eyes didn’t mean he was doomed to die the next day, it did mean God’s promise had been fulfilled. Simeon’s trust in this promise had been rewarded. Even if he didn’t live long enough to see how his words of prophecy played out, he was blessed to know that the consolation of Israel was here.\n\nThe same was true for widowed Anna, the prophetess who was “well along in years” (v.36). She stayed in the temple, serving God day and night. Though it is unlikely she lived to see the redemptive story of Jesus unfold, we do know she joyfully bore witness to the Christ child in her advanced age (vv.36–38).\n\nRemembering that God is the one who makes and keeps the biggest promises—including the ones that will outlast us—helps to strengthen our hope for today. In what ways do you need to trust in Him today? Grab hold of His promises. Even when we can’t see the full picture, God is our great Keeper of Promises.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nSomehow, I cannot picture John the Baptist as a multitasker. I don’t imagine he was smooth at dinner parties. I don’t reckon he cared much for distractions. He strikes me as someone who knew the one thing he was about, and he was deeply invested in that one thing. He was called to prepare the way of the Lord (Matthew 3:3), and by the grace of God, he was able to go about his business with that singular focus.\n\nThe life of John the Baptist is such a brilliant reminder to bring us back to the one thing we are about. And I don’t mean writing that novel, or going on a trip, or even perfecting our relationships. I’m talking about the one thing we are all, first and foremost, supposed to be about: the person of Jesus Christ.\n\nJohn fixed his sights wholly upon proclaiming the coming kingdom. His wilderness living was not just a weird lifestyle choice, but an unbending commitment to prayer and the Word of God. His devotion to Christ and His kingdom are particularly evident in two defining features of John’s life, and these two features should drive us to the same wholehearted seeking of God’s kingdom.\n\nFirst, John’s humility provokes us to bend our knees before the lordship of Christ. John was the greater Elijah, indeed, and according to Jesus, John was the greatest man to have yet walked the earth (Matthew 11:11). Yet John’s chief calling was to point the way to Christ who would bring the kingdom of heaven along with Him. Though John himself was the greatest of the prophets, he did not yield to the temptation of pride. Instead, he declared to his followers:\n\n“I baptize you with water for repentance,but the one who is coming after me is more powerful than I.I am not worthy to remove his sandals.He himself will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire” (Matthew 3:11).\n\nJohn further displayed this kind of humility when his own disciples began to abandon him to follow after Jesus, acknowledging: “He must increase, but I must decrease” (John 3:30). If John, the greatest of the prophets, so readily yielded up everything to Christ, how much more ought we do the same? The humility of John the Baptist is a reminder of the greatness of Christ.\n\nSecond, John’s courage provokes us to honor the lordship of Christ in faith-filled obedience. John did not hesitate to proclaim the gospel. His cry was continual: “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven has come near!” (Matthew 3:2). He offended the selfish pride in the hearts of the Pharisees and Sadducees, calling out their sin and declaring that they, too, must bow the knee to the true Lord of heaven and earth (vv.7–10).\n\nHe declares the same thing to us: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come! He proclaimed this message of the gospel—both its condemnation of sin, and its offer of salvation—even in the face of death. He called sin, sin, a thing we are often hesitant to do in this day and age. And he boldly proclaimed Christ as both Lord and Savior. Such courage only comes from knowing that Christ is Lord over all, and therefore, we need not fear the powers of earth. Such courage only comes from knowing that Christ is the Lamb of God, and therefore, we rest secure in the salvation He has purchased.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Nicodemus",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\n“There was a man from the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews” who knew the law (John 3:1), but had yet to encounter love Himself. That is, until the night he came to see Jesus. For Nicodemus, faith was synonymous with his pharisaical practices. His belief system was built on the foundation of strictly adhering to the rules and doing good works to please God. Faith in the person of Jesus was hard to make sense of beyond the law. So when Nicodemus sought Him out, Jesus told him the truth:\n\n“Truly I tell you, unless someone is born again,he cannot see the kingdom of God” (John 3:3).\n\nJesus told Nicodemus he was blind! This Pharisee had heard God’s Word, but did not recognize the person of Jesus standing before him. Without believing in Jesus and being “born of the Spirit,” Nicodemus would stand “condemned” (vv.8,18). Nicodemus must have walked away confused and conflicted. Yet, after Nicodemus personally met with Jesus, something in him changed.\n\nAs we follow his story, we see Nicodemus courageously confront the other Pharisees who tried to condemn Jesus unjustly (John 7:45–52). Later, he joined Joseph of Arimathea to anoint Jesus’s body for burial with aloe and myrrh—more than a thoughtful gesture, considering Nicodemus would have known that myrrh was used to anoint high priests and kings (John 19:38–42). Were his actions implying he now understood Jesus’s true role?\n\nAs we reach the end of Nicodemus’s story, I am led to believe that Nicodemus knew Jesus, not as a distant ideology, but as a personal Savior. We see his faith, though not instantaneous, refined over a series of choices to honor Jesus as more than a teacher: a King.\n\nThis is what happens when we meet the person of Jesus—we’re given life, again! Though we may not be physically reborn, we are forever changed. A personal encounter with Jesus opens our eyes and beckons us to turn and look at “the Son of Man… lifted up” for who He truly is (John 3:14). And by believing in Him, we receive the gift of eternal life (v.15). Now we have assurance of seeing the kingdom of God—not by anything we have done, but by what Jesus has done for us.\n\nWe can now come into the light of this saving truth, no longer hiding behind our seemingly good religious deeds. Instead, we continue to practice what Scripture instructs us to do—things like giving generously to the local church, honoring our parents, obeying God by sharing the gospel, fighting against injustice, remaining faithful to our spouses, or keeping the Sabbath—knowing that our faithfulness points to our God (John 3:21). And when we are tempted to earn our salvation, may we remember that Jesus invites us to seek Him and His kingdom (Matthew 6:33), whether in the middle of the night like Nicodemus or first light of day, at work or at home, in the classroom or the car. What He has for us is not just a set of rules, but a relationship. Not just the law, but a life-changing love.\n\nWriter and speaker Bailey T.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nDo it scared. This is a popular phrase today, one that shows up in books, podcasts, and hashtags. When I read the story of Peter fighting his way through the wind and waves, I’m reminded of this phrase and how it characterizes Peter’s faith-inspired action. But was “doing it scared” enough to sustain him on the water?\n\nIn this story, the disciple second-guesses his decision to join Jesus after observing the strength of the winds (Matthew 14:30). What was I thinking? That’s what I imagine him asking himself. No doubt, those winds felt stronger out on the surface of the water than back in the security of the boat. Wild and tempestuous, the winds circle the disciple, and his own fragility overtakes him. “Lord, save me!” he cries, feet plunging below the surface of the sea (v.30).\n\nNotice how it isn’t the lack of steady ground that Peter fears most. After all, he’s the one who asks Jesus to invite him onto the water, after seeing Jesus model the physics-defying act. Only after venturing out onto the water does Peter’s confidence begin to waver, as he notices just how powerful the wind’s ability to topple him actually is. Although Peter trusts the Lord enough to risk walking on water, that same trust doesn’t sustain him once the obstacles around him begin gaining power.\n\nBut it took a lot of faith for Peter to step out of the boat, right? When Jesus says, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?” (v.31), we might think to ourselves, Goodness, that’s a lot more faith than I would have had. Can’t we give this guy a break? But Jesus’s words don’t appear to be accusatory. They are an expression of His care. After rescuing Peter by reaching out His hand, Jesus continues to invite the disciple into a life of deeper connection and trust as they journey together.\n\nI’ll be the first to confess that I am forever taking my eyes off Jesus when I find myself in the midst of daunting situations. It’s easier to focus on the situation itself until it robs me of the very gifts meant to sustain me. You probably have your own courageous story of a time when you followed God, trust and confidence levels high, only to be met with fear and doubt further down the road.\n\nChrist not only strengthens us to follow Him, but His strength can also keep us steadfast in the face of peril. We do have permission to cry out when we need help, though. Sometimes He intercedes immediately and calls the surrounding elements into submission—like the salty wind and cold and choppy waves. But sometimes He allows the environment to persist without plucking us from it because it has the ability to form us into His likeness.\n\nNo matter what is going on in your life, Christ knows when and how to save you. His rescue is not delayed. Like Peter, when we cry out, He will answer. Carry God’s strength with you today as you “do it scared,” and trust that He is enough to sustain you against the fury of a thousand winds.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Jairus & His Daughter",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nStories like those from today’s passage of Jairus’s daughter and the bleeding woman aren’t just about miraculous healings. They also reveal to us what radical love for our neighbor looks like, what it means to deny social norms, and how legalism is disrupted—things Jesus embodied when He walked on the earth. Everything Jesus does is radical, but this particular passage alights something deep within my soul. I am just bowled over by the goodness of our Savior. This passage shows us how everything takes a backseat to the divinity and radical love of Christ.\n\nA woman with a twelve-year-long menstrual discharge, which has made her ceremonially unclean (Leviticus 15:25–27), goes into public looking for Jesus, believing He can heal her—if only she can touch the hem of His robe (Mark 5:25,28).\n\nA leader in the local synagogue (Jairus) comes looking for Jesus, begging Him to heal his daughter (Mark 5:22–23). Jesus goes to the man’s house and touches his dead daughter, and miraculously, she is healed (Mark 5:41).\n\nHe healed the woman and He raised the girl from the dead, even though in doing so, He has also made Himself “unclean,” according to levitical law. He does not call attention to Himself, shouting from the rooftops, “Look what I’m doing! Healing WOMEN! Touching the UNCLEAN! Breaking the LEVITICAL LAW! And in the house of a SYNAGOGUE LEADER!” Instead, He speaks with gentleness: “Don’t be afraid. Only believe” (Mark 5:36). He instructs those present not to tell anyone what He’s done (v.43).\n\nFollowing the rules did not save Jairus’s daughter, nor did visiting the experts stop the woman from bleeding. But belief did—faith that Jesus was who He said He was and would do what He said He would do. Jairus and the bleeding woman did not let fear cover them, but rather an insistent, consuming faith.\n\nEven as I type this, my heart is beating faster than it normally does, anxiety swelling up inside me for so many reasons. I’m worried about health, finances, my church family, the aftermath of tornadoes that touched down in our city in early spring, a global pandemic and resulting quarantine, the need for racial reconciliation within the Church and the country and around the world—and so much more. I fear death. I fear pain. I want to hunker down on the couch and never leave my house again.\n\nBut Jesus has two lessons for me from today’s reading in Mark. First, He calls me to live and love as radically as He did. Jesus denied custom and law to touch the sick and heal them. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus prioritizes the weak, the poor, the outcast, the suffering. As I seek to follow Him, I must do this too.\n\nSecond, I long for faith and love to chase away fear (1John 4:18), to trust the character of Jesus, to believe that He will accomplish all He has promised to do. I long to believe that the promise revealed to John in Revelation 21:4 is true: “He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away.” His words are my only hope in life and in death: “Don’t be afraid. Only believe.”\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Ellen L. Taylor\n\nI start every day with either a cup of coffee, a glass of orange juice, or a cup of tea. The variation depends on a few factors—weather, season, and hour—but the principle is the same: a quick beverage before I get my day started. But when I’m really, truly thirsty, the only thing that will satisfy that craving is plain old water. I prefer mine chilled, while others prefer room temperature. And some people will tell you that bubbly water hydrates you all the same, but I’m not convinced. I just want water.\n\nThe woman at the well might have thought the same thing when Jesus came to her as she was drawing water; she just wanted to get some water to drink. Jesus, exhausted from His travels, wanted the same thing. But the water that Jesus offers the woman is different from just normal water. He tells her that if she drinks this water, she will never be thirsty again (John 4:14).\n\nIt’s hard to comprehend a water that quenches thirst even more so than what we’re used to. But the woman, tired of coming to draw water from this physical well, is eager to hear what Jesus has to say about His water. According to societal norms, as a Jewish man, Jesus should not have even been associating with this woman, a Samaritan—and one who has had five husbands at that. But Jesus, in keeping with His way of reaching out to those who are cultural outcasts, sees her and offers her eternal life. Jesus, the Messiah, offers her living water.\n\nHave you ever seen a child come in from playing outside, grab a plastic cup of water, and gulp it down ferociously, with deep breaths after every sip? There’s nothing quite like that quenching of thirst. It provides almost instantaneous relief, and gives the child enough energy to run back out the door and keep playing. That’s how I imagine the promise of living water to be: instantaneous relief, courage to keep going, and knowledge that the thirst will not creep back up on you.\n\nThe living water of eternal life is offered to us now because of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. He has extended this grace to us, promising to never again leave us thirsty again. There will be a “well of water springing up” within us (John 4:14). When we drink from it, we experience the joy found in life with Christ. Come and drink, friends. Let us share in the goodness of living water.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nOn my birthday, my team at work went to lunch. After the burgers and fries, and while I sipped a delicious peanut butter milkshake, they asked me the annual “birthday questions”: What surprised you most this year? What was the hardest part of the year? The best? What did you learn about the Lord this year?\n\nI’ve learned many things about the Lord this year, but when I surveyed the last 365 days, it was encouraging and humbling to see a silver thread, a theme woven throughout the choices and challenges my family had made and experienced in 2019. The thread? His provision. His bountiful, beautiful, magnificent provision. He made a way in every desert (Isaiah 43:19). Every valley had a way out, every mountain had a gentle slope down.\n\nJesus provides beautifully and bountifully in today’s story about the boy who had five loaves and two fishes. We discover very little about the boy from the text itself, just that he was young (anywhere from a child to a man in his twenties), and that he was likely poor because the bread is described as being made of barley, which was common to the poor. But there’s another interesting detail tucked in there: it was almost Passover (John 6:4)—the Jewish holiday and feast celebrating God’s provision as He delivered His people from Egypt, the manna and quail they feasted on in the desert, and the promised land they inherited.\n\nBread is a silver thread running through Scripture, a reminder of God’s provision: manna in the desert (Exodus 16), Elisha’s miracle (2 Kings 4), and the provision of wheat for Ruth (Ruth 2). This event with the boy’s bread and fish took place shortly before Passover, and afterward, Jesus taught that He was the bread of life, sent from heaven (John 6:35). “This is the work of God,” Jesus said, “that you believe in the one he has sent” (v.29).\n\nA few chapters later, during Passover, Jesus and His disciples broke bread together (John 13). While John doesn’t record the conversation where Jesus blesses the bread and the wine and institutes the Lord’s supper, the other three Gospels do. Jesus, who had a short time before taught His disciples that He is the very bread of life, now broke a loaf, blessed it, and shared it with them.\n\nAnd he took bread, gave thanks, broke it, gave it to them,and said, “This is my body, which is given for you.Do this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19).\n\nAfter He is risen, He provides again through bread. He walks the Emmaus Road with two disciples, who do not recognize Him, and they invite Him to stay with them that night. And “it was as he reclined at the table with them that he took the bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him” (Luke 24:30–31). The disciples race to Jerusalem to find the rest of the disciples, describing “how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread” (v.35).\n\nHow many times throughout Scripture has God made Himself known through the breaking of bread? The Israelites, wandering through the desert with more manna than they could eat. Widowed Ruth’s overflowing baskets of wheat. Elisha’s miracle. A poor boy and his five loaves, multiplied to feed thousands.\n\nJesus is the bread of life, and He died on the cross in the ultimate act of bountiful and beautiful provision. And we, the communion of saints, have the privilege of sharing in that bread every time we partake in the Lord’s Supper. May Christ, our bread of life, always be made known through the breaking of the bread, the sign of God’s abundant provision to His people, throughout history and today.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nAs a little girl, bad dreams always drove me to make a beeline for my parents’ bedroom in the middle of the night. I’d wiggle my tiny body in between my mom and dad, and only then would my racing pulse steady. As I listened to the rhythms of my parents’ breathing, or saw the silhouettes of their faces in the moonlight, the memories of my nightmare would begin to fade. They didn’t even have to wake up for me to feel comforted. It was their presence that made the difference.\n\nMary Magdalene was a woman who sought the presence of Jesus. When Jesus traveled from town to town delivering the good news, Mary traveled with Him. As Jesus hung on the cross, Mary stood nearby. After His death, while His disciples scattered and hid, Mary stayed close to her Savior. She watched as Christ’s body was placed in a borrowed tomb.\n\nThough Mary’s conversion is mysterious, we know she knew the sorrows that result from a life lived far from God. And if the nightmares of that previous life came howling, I imagine she found comfort in the nearness of her Savior, even after His death.\n\nOn the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early,while it was still dark (John 20:1).\n\nI wonder what Mary experienced after Jesus’s death. Perhaps she tried to sleep but couldn’t. Perhaps images of her bruised and bloodied Healer rushed to the surface every time she closed her eyes. Maybe she’d spent the moonlit hours pacing, trying to shake the hopelessness that wanted to settle into the deepest crevices of her heart. Did she allow herself to think about life without Him and sigh, distraught?\n\nBefore the sun even dared to rise, Mary joined Salome and Mary, the mother of James, to anoint Christ’s body with spices (Mark 16:1). She wasn’t in denial about His death; she’d seen His lifeless body tucked into the dark tomb. But she felt compelled to join the other women in this act of care, and so she went to Him again, all the while wondering who would roll away the stone blocking them from His body. When she arrived, what she found was an empty tomb—and there, she met her risen Savior, before turning on her heel and running away to declare to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” (John 20:18).\n\nHow does a demon-possessed woman become the first proclaimer of the resurrection? She had been with Jesus. What was true of Mary is true for each of us: we all need the presence of Jesus. In His presence is peace and abundant joy (Psalm 16:11). May we seek and pursue Him as relentlessly as Mary did, confident His nearness will provide the comfort we crave.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nThe four Gospels tell the story of Jesus: His life, teachings, death, and resurrection. But the Gospels also tell the stories of the men and women who followed Him. The story of John, one of the twelve disciples, is traced through all four Gospel accounts, and is a story of beautiful transformation in the heart of someone who followed Him.\n\nA fisherman by trade, John was the brother of James, the son of Zebedee (Mark 1:19–20). Paul describes him as a “pillar” of the church (Galatians 2:9). He wrote the Gospel of John, the books of 1, 2, and 3 John, and Revelation. Within the pages of the book of John, he is referred to as a beloved disciple, or “the one Jesus loved” (John 13:23; 20:2).\n\nJohn was one of three disciples who witnessed the transfiguration of Jesus (Mark 9:2–3). Along with James and Peter, John saw a truly extraordinary event: Jesus transformed into His heavenly person, clothed all in white. The passage in Mark 9 echoes back to Moses’s encounter with God, when he came down from Mount Sinai and his face was still shining “as a result of his speaking with the LORD” (Exodus 34:29). Having been there from early on in Jesus’s earthly ministry, John knew Jesus was God’s beloved Son (Matthew 3:17), and having witnessed His transfiguration, he heard what Jesus would ultimately do (die and rise again), though John, along with James and Peter, wondered what this meant (Mark 9:7–10).\n\nLater, when Jesus further explained to His disciples that He would die and rise again, brothers James and John immediately took Him aside to ask if they might sit on His right and left hand in heaven, wanting the glory and honor represented by those positions (Mark 10:35–40). But Jesus flipped that idea on its head, telling them:\n\n“Whoever wants to become great among you will be your servant,and whoever wants to be first among you will be a slave to all.For even the Son of Man did not come to be served,but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many” (vv.43–45).\n\nThroughout the Gospels, we read of John’s own transformation from fisherman to follower of Jesus, from power-seeking to power-giving, testifying to Jesus’s lordship, “so that [others] may also have fellowship… with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ” (1John 1:2–3). Transformed by that fellowship, he became one of the New Testament’s most prolific writers, receiving God’s revelation of the future, fully realized kingdom of God (Revelation 1:9–11).\n\nGrace, redemption, and change—John, Peter, Matthew, and others are recorded as having their lives turned upside down by Christ. We are invited into the same transformation, and called to the same self-sacrifice as Jesus’s beloved disciple, John. It is a gift and grace to be called by Jesus, and a deep mercy to be transformed by His love, as John was.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nWhen you’re an adult, the question “What do you want for Christmas?” gets a lot harder. The things that make it on your list usually become more humanitarian, like social justice in your city, the health of your family, revival in the Church, and sure, maybe even a substantial tax return. Like an expectant child on Christmas morning, you hope against hope that your desires will come to pass. But they’re more like prayers now, and as we all know, prayers aren’t the same as a shopping list for gifts.\n\nWhen you read today’s story, did you ponder your own answer to Jesus’s question? At first glance, when Jesus asks the blind beggar Bartimaeus what he wants Jesus to do for him, it might seem like a trick question (Mark 10:51). Does Jesus really want to know our wants?\n\nThough the first part of the phrase, “What do you want,” may seem to lend itself to opening a can of self-indulgent responses, it’s the second part, “me to do for you,” where Christ’s heart really lives. He really does want to know what we want. (And let’s be honest, He already knows anyway.) But when I read the rest of His question, I see Him using it as an opportunity for building a bridge toward relationship.\n\nBartimaeus didn’t accost Jesus with a list of things he wanted but rather cried out, “Have mercy on me, Son of David!” (Mark 10:48). Bartimaeus wanted what so many of us take for granted: to see with his eyes (v.51). Having one of his core faculties restored was the beggar’s biggest need, and this encounter was a chance for Jesus to display His heart of generosity and kindness for one of His children.\n\nPrayer doesn’t work like a Christmas list, nor is it just a string of idealistic hopes. We can’t manipulate God into giving us what we want. But we do have the promise that He hears us, and the intimacy that is deepened during those moments of vulnerability when we express our felt needs to the Lord are worth everything.\n\nLike Bartimaeus, let’s ask for Christ to show mercy to us—and not just us but in all the realms that we hope for. We are already in His hands, the best possible place to be. Let’s trust that, whatever He chooses to do, God knows what is best for us and will act accordingly and in His perfect time. May we be brave enough to answer the same question posed to Bartimaeus: What do you want Jesus to do for you?\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nOur little Jonah is Tigger personified—a bouncy and sweet, rambunctious five-year-old. That means that at our house, there’s usually some kind of ball being thrown somewhere. With our high living room ceilings, the constant air assault, and the dodging, our house can feel a lot like a middle school gym class.\n\nOne ball has always been Jonah’s favorite: a foam mini football. He threw it so often that it ripped and busted out of its fabric casing. Jonah didn’t care. He kept throwing it until it was just an oblong sphere of stuffing barely holding together. For months, he refused to throw anything else.\n\nThrowing and bouncing and catching is Jonah’s love language. One day, I decided to embrace it full force. You know those huge bouncy balls from big box stores, the ones in bins at the end of the aisle? I got him one. I got him the biggest, 18-inch, bright red, nearly-half-his-size ball.\n\nI didn’t think a little face could contain that much joy. He’s since played with it for hours and hours. Believe it or not, the old foam football (which we’ve since replaced with a new one) hasn’t seen much playing time lately. Nothing captures Jonah’s heart like his massive, red, bouncy ball. He didn’t know something so wonderful existed.\n\nThere was a young man in Scripture who was holding on to something tightly, yet God wanted to bless him beyond his understanding. When the rich, young ruler came to Jesus and asked Him what he needed to do to gain eternal life, he and Jesus first discussed obeying some of the Ten Commandments. The man assured Jesus that he had followed them, and Jesus didn’t disagree. Then Scripture describes a deeply beautiful moment: “Looking at him, Jesus loved him” (Mark 10:21). Oh, the eyes of our Savior, showering love on this young man. Then Jesus said:\n\n“You lack one thing:Go, sell all you have and give to the poor,and you will have treasure in heaven.Then come, follow me” (Mark 10:21).\n\nThis is the only time in the Gospels that Jesus makes such a demand of a potential disciple. Scripture tells us Peter owned a house (Matthew 8:14), so following Jesus doesn’t necessarily mean leaving behind all of our earthly possessions. So why did Jesus make such a high demand? Because He knew that the young man’s wealth had his heart—it had his heart so deeply that the thought of giving his wealth away grieved him (Mark 10:22). Jesus knew He had something in store for the young man that was far beyond what he could comprehend: Himself. And so He told the young man to let go of what was keeping him back, and to follow Him instead.\n\nThe man walked away sad. We don’t know whether or not he ever decided to follow Jesus. We only have a Polaroid snapshot of this single moment in time. I hope we’ll meet this young man in heaven one day and he’ll say, “That moment was a turning point for me. Jesus’s loving gaze undid me. So after a time, I let go—of everything—and I grabbed on to Him. I thought I was rich before, but my heart couldn’t even comprehend the depths of the riches of knowing Jesus. He is my greatest treasure.”\n\nWe know that richness, don’t we? We are those who have been looked on and loved by our Savior. May His kindness lead us to pray: Jesus, if our hearts, prone to wander, start pining after lesser treasures, may Your love undo us and call us back to You.\n\nLaurin Greco is an author, editor, and mommy who lives in the Nashville area with her author/editor husband and her not quite author/editor three young sons.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Ellen L. Taylor\n\n“Zacchaeus was a wee little man/ And a wee little man was he. / He climbed up in a sycamore tree / For the Lord he wanted to see.”\n\nIf you grew up in Sunday school classes like I did, it’s likely that you sang this song surrounded by Cheerios and orange juice. For me, it was also the only thing I knew about Zacchaeus until I reached adulthood. Zacchaeus was short, he wanted to see Jesus, and he climbed a tree in order to see Him. End of story—Everyone grab your coloring pages and some crayons!\n\nBut reading Zacchaeus’s story now paints a different picture entirely. Zacchaeus was a tax collector, meaning he got rich off of everyone else’s money, which likely meant those people didn’t like him very much. He was an outcast, a loner. And just like everyone else in the town, he wanted to see Jesus. He wanted to find out more about this man people were talking about, this man who promised eternal life. So Zacchaeus climbed up a sycamore tree to be able to see, and when Jesus passed, He told Zacchaeus to come down because He was going to be staying at his house (Luke 19:5).\n\nAll the people in the town who overheard this were shocked. But Jesus, as He often does, was spending time with the people who were regularly looked over and cast aside. He was spending His time with the marginalized. After Jesus reached out to Zacchaeus in kindness, aligning Himself with the tax collector, Zaccheus became convicted of his sin and was then led to repent (Romans 2:4), declaring that he would give half of his possessions to the poor, and return extorted money four times over (Luke 19:8). In the eyes of everyone else, Zacchaeus was merely a rich, greedy man, but Jesus saw him as a man to invite into conversation, into community and relationship. Jesus told Zaccheus:\n\n“Today salvation has come to this house…because he too is a son of Abraham.For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost” (Luke 19:9–10).\n\nJesus came to earth to save the lost. He came for Zacchaeus. Jesus saw him up in the tree, and Jesus saw him when he came down. He saw Zacchaeus for who he truly was: a child of God, one of the very reasons He’d left a heavenly kingdom in order to bring the good news of salvation and His kingdom to us (Matthew 6:10).\n\nFrom that day on, Zacchaeus chose not to serve the gods of money and wealth, but to serve the God who saved him from himself. His heart turned from a love of money to a love of Jesus and His message (Matthew 6:24)—all because Jesus saw him in the midst of his sinfulness and chose to love him anyway. Jesus does the same for us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nLately, I’ve been considering how necessary it is to have friends. Long distance friends are great, of course. It’s crazy that we live in a world where we can pick up a device and have a real-time conversation while living on another continent, or even a mile away. But there’s something essential about the everyday friends you can text last minute when your car engine dies. Friends you can grab ice cream with on the hardest of days. Friends who don’t mind lingering in the living room because you both just really need to talk—about that one guy or interview or the latest book you bought on Amazon.\n\nChristians often say that all we need is Jesus. While I understand where this sentiment comes from regarding Jesus, Scripture all tells us that our Triune, relational God created us for relationship (Genesis 1:26; 2:18), calls us His friends (John 15:15), and asks us to be His own hands and feet (1 Corinthians 12:4–12, 27). So, although it’s true that “Jesus and…” doesn’t accurately reflect how salvation works, it does reflect how community works. Even Jesus didn’t choose to minister in isolation. He allowed people to provide Him with food and relational support. Even Jesus had His own set of friends, one of them being Lazarus.\n\nWe don’t learn much about Lazarus firsthand from Scripture. We never “hear” him speak. Instead, we learn about him through the words and emotional responses of his sisters and his friends. “Lord, the one you love is sick,” said Mary and Martha in a concerned message about their brother (John 11:3). Jesus is equally troubled when he hears that his close friend has died. His emotional reaction gives away the depth of His affection, as the Jews watch tears fall from Christ’s face (vv.33–36).\n\nYou see, the centerpiece of this story isn’t Lazarus—it’s Jesus. The whole story is funneled through the lens of Christ’s love. Our Savior, the One who gave up life itself for three days, first experienced what it was like to give up His own friend. He was well-acquainted with loss, an experience that allowed Him to sympathize with us on a visceral, human level.\n\nRevisiting the sentiment “All we need is Jesus,” maybe a better way to look at it is this: “Jesus is the only way to salvation, but we need each other to flourish in our God-given identity.” It’s not as snappy, but at least it’s true.\n\nRemember that Jesus calls you His friend. You know that one person who will sit with you in your pain until you’ve exhausted every word in the English language? Or the one you can steal away to your favorite hiking spot with? Not only is Jesus your High Priest and Redeemer, but He is also that sort of friend.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Abby Flynn\n\nDo you ever lay in bed at night and worry? Between moving to a new city, the coronavirus pandemic, and having a newborn, in the last few months, I’ve probably done enough worrying for it to be my full-time job.\n\nSometimes I remember to stop, pray, and give it to the Lord. And sometimes, I stay up way too late, writing endless lists of the things I can do to make life feel a little more under control.\n\nHave you ever been there? No? Just me, then?\n\nIf you grew up in Sunday school, at some point, you were probably taught to, “Be a Mary, not a Martha!” And though I’ve always related to Martha, she definitely gets a bad rap. When Jesus came to visit Mary and Martha in Luke 10, Mary sat at Jesus’s feet and listened to His every word. Meanwhile, Martha cleaned the kitchen; I sometimes imagine her banging pots and pans around passive-aggressively, annoyed that her sister couldn’t bother to help out, especially when company is in the house.\n\nAfter hearing Lazarus is sick, Jesus waits two days before going to see him (John 11:6–7). When He arrives, Mary sits and waits for Him at the house, while Martha runs out to meet Him. “Lord,” she tells Him, “if you had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died” (v.21). But despite this conviction, Martha still has trouble believing Jesus when He tells her Lazarus will rise again; it’s difficult to believe beyond what she sees with her own eyes in that moment (v.24).\n\nFinally, in John 12, we see a dinner given for Jesus before the Passover. At the dinner, Martha stays busy serving everyone, Lazarus reclines with Jesus, and Mary anoints Him with expensive perfume, filling the room with its fragrance.\n\nOur girl Martha is busy! She worries a lot. Knowing her so well, loving her as only He can, Jesus seems to address this head on:\n\n“Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset about many things,but one thing is necessary. Mary has made the right choice,and it will not be taken away from her” (Luke 10:41–42).\n\nThrough these small glimpses into Martha’s life, we see her cleaning, running a household, and serving. Martha strived to honor the Lord with her actions, but it was often at the expense of actually spending time in His presence. Meanwhile, Mary sat, listened, and anointed Jesus. While both women wanted to honor, serve, and love Him, in the end, it is Mary who “made the right choice.”\n\nIt’s easy for us to glorify Mary and berate Martha, but we all have a little Martha inside of us. She was distracted by her many tasks. But how many of those tasks did she feel like she was doing for the kingdom? How many times was she consumed by doing “all the things” instead of focusing on the one, most important thing?\n\nJesus looked at Martha, really saw her, and said, “You are worried and upset about many things.” Is this true of you today? Have you brought those things to the feet of Jesus? Have you laid them down, and taken time to sit and listen to what He has to say? Or are you busy, working, running around in a flurry, and getting angry at others for not noticing just how hard you’re trying? (I’m speaking to myself here, too.)\n\nWhat is God doing right now, in this moment? And what does He want to reveal to you about Himself? Is it time for you to sit down, stop striving, and finally rest? Mary chose the one thing, the good part, the better portion. And we would be wise to do the same.\n\nAbby Flynn is a wife, mom of two, and freelance copywriter living in Charlotte, NC. She loves bargain hunting and house hunting.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Ellen L. Taylor\n\nHave you ever been betrayed by someone you love? I know I have. And I’ve been on the other side, too. Betrayal seems to be woven into the thread of humanity after the fall; we disappoint others and turn our backs on them, and they do the same to us. Oftentimes apologies and reconciliation follow, but sometimes the cut is just too deep to heal without an ugly, nasty scar on the relationship.\n\nJudas and Jesus were friends. Judas was one of Jesus’s twelve disciples, the group of men who traveled around with Him as He taught and preached. These disciples had great responsibility—they were chosen by Jesus to be fishers of men, to be by His side as He worked to spread the good news. They were even with Jesus during His last days on earth.\n\nThe story of Judas betraying Jesus is familiar to me. I heard it all the time growing up, particularly around Easter time while studying the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Wicked Judas, betraying his Teacher for thirty pieces of silver. There are a couple of things that prick my heart every time I read this story. The first is that Judas tells the chief priests that the one he kisses is the person to arrest. A kiss, a sign of affection, turned on its head and used for unspeakable means. And even more poignant is that in the midst of betrayal, Jesus calls Judas “friend” (Matthew 26:50). Jesus knew exactly what Judas was there to do—He even hinted at it during the Last Supper in the upper room (vv.20–25). Jesus knew He would be betrayed, and He knew Judas was going to do it.\n\nThese two things—the kiss and the use of the word “friend” to describe Judas—communicate to the reader that Jesus was being betrayed by someone who He’d been in relationship with. Jesus’s disciples saw Him in some of His darkest moments on earth. They were with Him when He went to raise Lazarus from the dead (John 11:11–16) and when He ate His last meal (Matthew 26:26–35). Friendship is an intimate, sacred thing, but in the end, Judas betrayed his friend.\n\nAnd when Judas led the chief priests and elders to Jesus, greeting Him with a kiss and setting His arrest into motion, that is how Jesus addressed him:\n\n“Friend,” Jesus asked him, “why have you come?” (Matthew 26:50).\n\nJesus knew exactly why Judas had come, yet He called Judas “friend”—perhaps giving him a chance to choose differently, to choose reconciliation instead of betrayal, though we may never really know. What we do know is that the character of Jesus does not change (Hebrews 13:8). And while you and I and all of humanity were still sinners and enemies of God—that is when Jesus died for us (Romans 5:8–10).\n\nHe died for our reconciliation to God. He died to bring us into a right and lasting relationship with the Father, so that we could be called “friends” of God (John 15:15).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Patti Sauls\n\n“Oh, I just can’t wait to be king!” declares the lion cub, Simba, in the 1994 movie, The Lion King. Simba struts as he sings of all the power and advantages he will enjoy when he inherits his father’s throne. The royal cub’s swagger is short-lived, though, as tragedy and trials arise. No spoiler alert needed—it’s obvious that young Simba is clueless about what it really means to be king.\n\nThroughout His ministry, Jesus was surrounded by others’ confusion about what it means to be King. Many people were drawn to His teaching and were convinced by His miracles that He was the long-awaited Messiah who would rule as King in Jerusalem and restore the Jewish nation. Just days before His arrest and crucifixion, jubilant crowds waved palm branches and proclaimed: “Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the king of Israel!” (John 12:13)\n\nBut not everyone wanted to crown Him King. The Jewish leaders were suspicious of Jesus’s growing influence, threatened by His miracles, and outraged by His claims of being united with God. All of this could disrupt their religious power dynamic. How would it affect their status if this man from Nazareth gained power?\n\nThe chief priests wanted to eliminate this threat by executing Jesus, but they knew that only Roman authorities could implement the death penalty (John 18:31–32). So, they arrested Him and charged Him with claiming to be “King of the Jews.” They hoped this would force the Roman governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate, to declare Jesus a political rebel and sentence Him to death. The stakes were high. Some crowds wanted Jesus to be king. Others, riled up by the Jewish leaders, wanted Him killed. As governor, Pilate was tasked with keeping the peace between his territory’s people and the rule of Rome.\n\nPilate knew the leaders wanted Jesus executed, but he couldn’t reconcile the calm, quiet man before him with such fierce allegations of rebellion. Three times Pilate insisted that he saw no basis for a criminal charge, but the unrelenting crowds threatened, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar’s friend. Anyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar!” (John 19:12). Seeing the crowd’s mounting frenzy and fearing Roman backlash, Pilate buckled under the pressure and condemned Jesus to a torturous death on a cross.\n\nThe sign that Pilate fastened to Jesus’s cross stated, “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS” (John 19:19). This was no ordinary notice of a criminal’s name and offense. It should stop us in our tracks because it was, and forever will be, a revelation of who Jesus really is. Jesus is the King who secures restoration and redemption for His people. He is the King who deflates status-seeking and disrupts self-centered living.\n\nPilate had this sign written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek so that all could read it (John 19:20). Jesus died and rose again so that we, too, could have the eyes of our hearts opened. We don’t have to wait for Jesus to be an earthly king. We see and recognize that our King has come. Hosanna! Blessed is the King of Israel!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nThe crowds were right: somebody needs to pay. We all want justice, and the craving for it is a righteous one. Sin cannot go unpunished, “for the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23).\n\nIn Matthew 27 we read the account of Jesus and Barabbas, two men paraded before an angry crowd under the watchful eye of Pontius Pilate. A strange custom was unfolding; mob mentality was both judge and jury. Given the choice between two prisoners, the crowds got to decide who walked away a free man.\n\nBarabbas was guilty, and no one was denying it. His crimes were “notorious,” widely known (Matthew 27:16). Jesus, on the other hand, was innocent. Still the crowds looked at Him and screamed, “Crucify him!” (v.22). They were not blind to Barabbas’s guilt—they simply failed to recognize their own. Spiritual blindness kept them from seeing how much they needed the Savior standing right in front of them.\n\n“You denied the Holy and Righteous Oneand asked to have a murderer released to you.You killed the source of Life,whom God raised from the dead;we are witnesses of this” (Acts 3:14–15).\n\nThe crowds allowed the guilty man to walk in freedom. Is this ringing any bells? We are all Barabbas. All of us “have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). When it comes to sin, we’re guilty, notorious sinners who cannot stand against the holy scrutiny of God.\n\nThough I’d love to read this passage and villainize Barabbas, I can’t, not really. He is the poster child for the good news, a symbol of the atonement Jesus made for us all. True, Barabbas was guilty, but there’s no use in pointing fingers. In one way or another, we are all guilty.\n\nFor soon after Jesus took Barabbas’s place before the crowds, He took our place at Calvary. This is the gospel! Jesus chose the cross. He walked toward it willingly so that the guilty—like Barabbas, like you, like me—could be spared the punishment we deserve and walk away in freedom.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nSome things seem just too good to be true. But there’s hope, even for doubters.\n\nThomas was a practical man. He needed to know how things were going to work before he would assent. Is He really risen? Show me the nail scars. How will we get to heaven? Well, someone will need to give directions or scribble down a map. Abstract concepts didn’t seem to be working for him (John 14:5). He needed the concrete facts—that’s just how Thomas thought. Actually, it’s how we all tend to think. Why walk by faith, when you can walk by carefully peer-reviewed sight? (Goodness, Thomas would have loved the fantastic process of academic peer review!) The truth is, most of us are predisposed to doubt just like Thomas.\n\nWhat then are we to think of Thomas’s faith? We must not make the mistake of thinking Thomas was totally devoid of it. He did believe. Yes, he doubted until the moment He saw Christ appear before him, but Christ Himself still recognized that Thomas believed. Perhaps we could say he was a man of slow, or maybe even weak, faith. Thomas is all of us; while we say, “I do believe,” we must also cry, “help my unbelief!” (Mark 9:24).\n\nThomas’s life is a reminder of the incredible mercy of God. Jesus had spent years walking with His disciples, teaching them, explaining to them what would happen: how He would be arrested, crucified and buried, and how He would rise again. Thomas had heard all of it, again and again. But the death and resurrection of Christ was a wholly new concept, not unlike how we are slow to understand a color that’s left of red or right of indigo on the spectrum. When the fulfillment came, Thomas fled before Jesus’s captors. He had seen Jesus’s terrible death, yet he still could not come to accept that the rest would come true—that ultimately, it would end, not in sorrow, but in resurrection. It was too good to be true.\n\nBut, when at last the Savior stood before him, Jesus did not rebuke Thomas. Instead, He reassured him. He gently encouraged the doubter (John 20:27). What tender mercy! What abounding grace! It feels too good to be true.\n\nAs with Thomas, our own common sense and practical realism are often a barrier to deep faith. As with Thomas, we also often walk by sight, instead of believing that God will do just as He said. But for us, as for Thomas, there is grace. God is not threatened by your doubts, or undone by your hesitations. He is gentle and lowly of heart (Matthew 11:29). In His great patience, He calls us into the rest that He gives. The Lord, the Resurrected One who has conquered sin and death, is yet so gracious that He offers comfort to slow and foolish hearts such as ours.\n\n“Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments and untraceable his ways!” (Romans 11:33). Despite our skepticism, He gently chides us, saying, “Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe” (John 20:29), and then also offers us ever-increasing evidence of His faithfulness and truth. He offers mercies that are new every morning (Lamentations 3:22–23), that we may daily repent of our doubting hearts, and run to Him again in faith. The answer to all our doubts, as it was for Thomas, is Christ Himself. Fix your eyes upon Him, because the gospel is true, and our God is so very good.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nGod’s people are to be filled people. Not barely-enough people or just-a-trickle people, but filled to overflowing. The apostle Stephen knows what I mean.\n\nPerhaps your frame of reference for him is “Stephen the Martyr,” the one who died at the hands of an angry religious mob just as the Church was being birthed. I don’t dispute the facts; Stephen did, in fact, become the first Christian martyr when he was mercilessly killed for his faith. It’s Stephen’s legacy I take issue with. As I look again at the details of Stephen’s life, recorded in Acts 6–7, it’s not his death that reaches through the pages and grabs my heart. It’s his life—his filled-to-overflowing life.\n\nScripture records that Stephen was a man “full of faith and the Holy Spirit” (Acts 6:5). He didn’t have a teensy measure of faith, or enough faith to get by. Stephen was full of faith, and because of his faith in Jesus, he was also full of the Holy Spirit. Fast forward a few verses and we read that Stephen was “full of grace and power” (v.8), and again, the image is more than enough.\n\nWhen pressed by the religious leaders, Stephen started preaching. Boy howdy, did that boy preach! His powerful words show us that he was full of wisdom and full of the truth found in Scripture. When his opponents became enraged and moved to silence once and for all, Scripture records:\n\nStephen, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven.He saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.He said, “Look, I see the heavens openedand the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” (Acts 7:55–56).\n\nAs he breathed his final breaths, Stephen cried out, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!” and asked that God would “not hold this sin against” those who’d killed him (vv.59–60). Sound familiar? If so, that’s because they echo the words Jesus uttered as He hung and died on the cross (Luke 23:46, 34). It’s as if Stephen was so filled with God’s words that they were at the very surface of his heart. When Stephen was squeezed, it was Jesus’s words that spilled out.\n\nOh, do not picture our brother Stephen buried and bloodied, for that is not all he was. Stephen’s heart was filled with love for his Savior because he was running over with wisdom, grace, and power. Because of Christ’s work for us and in us, we can be filled up too. Didn’t the apostle Paul urge us to “be filled with the Spirit”? (Ephesians 5:18). Doesn’t Scripture record that we can be “filled with encouragement” and “overflowing with joy [even] in all our afflictions”? (2Corinthians 7:4). Didn’t the prophet Micah proclaim that he was “filled with power by the Spirit of the LORD”? (Micah 3:8). Yes, God’s people are to be filled people.\n\nLord Jesus, make us more like Stephen, filled to overflowing with you.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nAs one of the seven deacons chosen to care for the poor, Philip had a good reputation in the community and was full of wisdom and the Holy Spirit (Acts 6:3, 5). Philip followed the movement of the Holy Spirit with obedience and devotion to what God was doing through him. When the Spirit redirected his plans by leading him to a specific ministry opportunity, he followed with enthusiasm and was God’s vessel for showing the “immeasurable riches of his grace through his kindness to us in Christ Jesus” (Ephesians 2:7).\n\nThese two stories from today’s reading contrast God’s pursuit of many and of one, both in surprisingly bold yet gentle ways. Through Philip, God reaches down into the territory of Samaria, and purposefully chooses to make the lame, paralyzed, and demon-possessed a people for His own possession (Acts 8:5–8; 1Peter 2:9). But remember that at that time, “Jews [would] not associate with Samaritans” (John 4:9). This is the shocking grace and kindness of God’s upside-down kingdom on display.\n\nLater, Philip came across an Ethiopian official, who was also a eunuch, heading home in his chariot after worshiping in Jerusalem. He sat with a copy of the book of Isaiah open, reading the prophet’s words aloud. God orchestrated a divine meeting and chose to use Philip as His hands and feet, delivering the gospel message to the Ethiopian man. His position in life meant he was not welcome to worship with Jews (Deuteronomy 23:1), yet he was still determined to know God (Acts 8:31). Philip, led by the Holy Spirit, “proceeded to tell him the good news about Jesus, beginning with [the] Scripture” he’d been reading (v.35), which said:\n\nHe was led like a sheep to the slaughter,and as a lamb is silent before its shearer,so he does not open his mouth.In his humiliation justice was denied him.Who will describe his generation?For his life is taken from the earth (Acts 8:32–33).\n\nAfter hearing Philip’s explanation of the passage and understanding that the good news of Jesus was for him, too, everything changed for this man, leading him to excitedly ask to be baptized at the first sight of water (Acts 8:36). Reconciliation through Jesus Christ meant that he would never again have to be separated from God (Isaiah 56:4–5). He was welcomed into the family of God. Like the Ethiopian official, these shocking promises of grace and kindness in God’s upside-down kingdom should bring us great joy and peace.\n\nIn both of these accounts, Philip was led by the Holy Spirit to faithfully testify to the power of God through Jesus Christ, which has come to claim all people for His glory. And while Philip is an example of a faithful servant of God fulfilling the Great Commission, ultimately, the story of Philip is not really about Philip at all; his story points to an otherworldly mercy that claims us as God’s own, calling us out of darkness and into His eternal light (1 Peter 2:9–10).\n\nBrooke Kocher is a wife and mother of three.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nHave you ever been to a gym with a coaching program that promises personal transformation? I’ve known people who have signed up for those, and it often works. Over the course of six weeks, their bodies went from looking like they had never set foot in a gym to approaching model-worthy. Unfortunately, most of the time, the results didn’t last. Because the thing with transformation is that it requires you to stay committed far beyond the accountability that a six-week program offers.\n\nUnlike a fitness routine, Paul’s inner transformation was lasting. It was so quick it’s almost unbelievable. If we didn’t have his full ministry story, thanks to the New Testament, we might be more skeptical. Who is this guy who suddenly decided he was on the same team as Christ’s followers? One day he’s breathing threats and murder and the next he’s proclaiming Jesus in the synagogues (Acts 9:1, 20). What made the difference?\n\nChrist made the difference. His calling on Paul’s life is what changed him, as God commissioned him to be a “chosen instrument” and take His name to “Gentiles, kings, and Israelites” (Acts 9:15), when Paul encountered a light from heaven. Once he’d encountered the true, living Christ, Paul never went back to his old ways of living.\n\nUnderstandably, Paul received distrust from those who only knew him as a murderer, and so he had to rest in the knowledge that God knew his heart and its transformation. That’s what mattered most. God was his defender and advocate and, as we see from Barnabus’s response, He sent people from Paul’s community to advocate for him too (Acts 9:27). No matter how unbelievable it looked, the apostle’s transformation was real.\n\nWe are human beings who will inevitably fall short. There is grace for that. When it’s merely our own resolve that gets us into the gym or prompts us to give up something, the results may or may not be what we’d hope for. But when it’s God who calls us into something, there is a much better success rate. When it comes to that kind of supernatural spiritual transformation, He alone completes the work and deserves all the glory (2Corinthians 11:30–31).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nThe book of Acts describes Tabitha as a disciple who “was always doing good works and acts of charity” (Acts 9:36). When Tabitha died, Jesus’s followers in Joppa sent men to Peter who urged Him to not delay in coming with them to see her (v.38). They expected the Lord to do mighty things, and He did: through Peter, God raised Tabitha from the dead, and “this became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord” as a result (v.42).\n\nSometimes my heart is numb or my head is distracted when I read God’s Word, and mighty works like this one from today’s reading roll past my heart without registering the awesome power of our God. Not only that, but when I read about these expectant disciples in Joppa, I realize I don’t often expect God to do mighty things. “But God”—what a beautiful phrase of grace—“who is rich in mercy” awakened my heart today (Ephesians 2:4), reminding me that He most definitely continues to display His power throughout and within His creation. For just as God raised Tabitha from the dead, He raised us too! We were once dead in our sin, but “because of his great love that he had for us, [He] made us alive with Christ… [We] are saved by grace!” (vv.1, 4–5).\n\nI’ll most likely be trying to wrap my head around this truth until I’m home, in heaven. It wasn’t because we were “always doing good works and acts of charity” that God saved us. No, it is by His power and His grace, and because of His unimaginable love for us that He willingly went to the cross.\n\nWherever you are and whatever your worries, struggles, uncertainties, hardships, sufferings today—stop, be still, and meditate on what is true: the God whose power is so mighty that He is able resurrect people like Tabitha from the dead, is the same God who pursues you and me. Whatever your current circumstances look like, whether they stir up fear or thanksgiving in your heart, remember this:\n\nThe LORD your God is among you,a warrior who saves.He will rejoice over you with gladness.He will be quiet in his love.He will delight in you with singing” (Zephaniah 3:17).\n\nIf you are in Christ, your eternal life is secure because of Jesus. His blood has made this possible, but it was His love for you that led Him to the cross. He has raised you to “walk in newness of life” (Romans 6:4). Rest in His mighty love for you today, for you are truly beloved indeed.\n\nKimberly Girard is a well-loved child of God, wife of an extraordinary man, mother of three amazing kids, and writer living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nWhat is the answer to inequality?\n\nWe clamor for solutions for true freedom, equality, individual rights, ethnic and racial tensions, and economic disparity. By themselves, our ideas and even our very best intentions are not enough. But really, we do know the ultimate answer to things like lasting change and reconciliation: the gospel of grace.\n\nCornelius’s life is a reminder of the great mystery of the gospel. In that day and age, there were distinct lines drawn between Jews and Gentiles, separating them by belief and ceremony, and many other practices, both cultural and religious. And so Cornelius’s story is a reminder that salvation belongs to our God, and the gospel is freely given to all who choose to receive it (Revelation 7:10; Matthew 10:8). From the beginning, the only answer to the tumult of human struggle, to the walls of social division, to the lines of entrenched hatred, is the gospel. God alone can do something new, transformative, and lasting, making “a way in the wilderness, rivers in the desert” (Isaiah 43:19). As the first Gentile to put his trust in Jesus, Cornelius was forever changed by a visit from an angel at three o’clock in the afternoon, a vision that put him on a journey that completely reframed his entire worldview.\n\nPeter also had a vision around that same time, and the clean and unclean animals are a reminder of this truth. This was not chiefly a social realization; it was the direct act of a gracious God who, in His own time, opened the eyes of man to see exactly what Christ’s coming truly meant: that sinners of every race, clan, tongue, and nation, could be made new and holy by faith in Jesus Christ. God sent a vision to Cornelius, even as He sent the vision to Peter. However, the chief character in this story is not Cornelius, nor is it Peter—it is God Himself. In the same way, we do not receive salvation by our own actions or merit, but because of the merit and actions of Christ Himself. In each case, it is God who calls and justifies, sanctifies and glorifies. Our salvation and reconciliation to God are not of ourselves.\n\nA remarkable scene ensues after Peter agrees to go to the house of Cornelius. We are told that Peter stands and begins to deliver the message of the gospel to the Gentiles assembled there, and “while Peter was still speaking… the Holy Spirit came down on all those who heard” (Acts 10:44), making the message very clear: the salvation of man is not of man, but wholly of God—in God’s time, in God’s way, by God’s own doing. “What God has made clean, do not call impure” (v.15).\n\nLike Peter, we need to remember that we are all human, but that through Jesus Christ alone, we all have access to salvation (vv. 36). We can join with all the people of the world, united in our calling to be about the business of “declaring the greatness of God” to a world that desperately needs to hear it (v.46), just like you and I do.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nGrowing up, my family teased my brother about how he should run for president. He had the brains and the vision, and we even created a fun Facebook page with a 2028 campaign that gained a decent following of friends. He used to laugh it off and roll his eyes every time a ghost writer posted an update, while never actually denying the fact that he would make a good candidate. I’m still holding out that our playful digital campaign efforts sweep the house in 2028. Can you imagine if one day your brother became president?\n\nEven more so, can you imagine if your brother claimed to be the Messiah? I mean, I love my brother more than anything, but that’s on a whole other level. A bold move like that would no doubt give me serious cause for concern. Even if I were familiar with Old Testament prophecies and could vouch for the integrity of my sibling, I would have all sorts of questions, namely: Of all the people out there, how could the Messiah be my brother?\n\nI imagine that James, the brother of Jesus, wrestled with a question like this. We aren’t given a substantive origin story for James all in one place, so we have to weave together a few distinct verses like a patchwork quilt to gain a glimpse of the life of this man. We’re told that Jesus had four brothers: James, Joses, Judas, and Simon, and at least two sisters (Mark 6:2–3). We know that, after watching his brother attract a following in the synagogues while simultaneously offending the Nazarene crowds, Jesus’s family declared Him to be “out of his mind” and tried to restrain Him (Mark 3:20–21). We know that James and his brothers mocked Jesus, and didn’t believe in Him during His earthly ministry (John 7:1–5).\n\nBut then something happens. After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to James (1Corinthians 15:6–7). While Scripture doesn’t give us specific details about this story, it’s evident that at some point after the resurrection, James became a convert and disciple of Jesus. I imagine that after experiencing the trauma of having a brother crucified and buried, you start to listen to what He has to say after His lungs are filled with life again.\n\nJames became a leader of the church in Jerusalem (Acts 15:13–29; Galatians 1:18–19). He wrote the book of James—and in it, he says, “Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger” (James 1:19). More than any other New Testament book, the teachings that fill these pages mirror the teachings of Jesus and His signature Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7). And it makes sense that Jesus would have influenced James’s communication and storytelling techniques. They were brothers, after all.\n\nBefore Jesus’s death, James didn’t understand Jesus and His ministry. But after bearing witness to His sacrificial death and resurrection, he was changed forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nMy friend and I were having one of those classic, two-hour conversations that happens in your car long after the coffee shop closes. Through a series of events, God chose to make us companions and accountability partners during this current stage of life, and because we’re so different, we can usually offer a good counterbalance to whatever headspace the other is in. It goes something like this:\n\n“Don’t believe that narrative. That’s a lie straight from the enemy.”\n\nTonight, it was me who needed those words. Next week, it could be her. Often it’s both of us, and we end up serving words of truth back and forth like a round of tennis. As I’m sure you’ve experienced, these sorts of pep talks can be an hour-by-hour exchange, as we navigate the way of Jesus together with those around us.\n\nAquila and Priscilla are one of the Bible’s power couples. When they offer Apollos constructive feedback on how he can explain God “more accurately,” we see what it looks like for believers to hold each other accountable without taking offense (Acts 18:26). Instead of being reactionary and letting his ego get the better of him, Apollos receives their correction and continues arguing his case for the Messiah. Because Aquila and Priscilla were obedient in exercising their gifts, Apollos became even more effective for the kingdom.\n\nIt’s such a great story, right? Whether or not his pride was hurt, it doesn’t interfere with the ministry Apollos is leading. His response is a beautiful illustration of Proverbs 10, which says, “The one who follows instruction is on the path to life, but the one who rejects correction goes astray” (v.17).\n\nIn Romans, Paul warns us against seeing ourselves as more important than others, because every part of the Body of Christ has a unique role (Romans 12:3–8). Each gift we possess is equally valuable, yet these gifts are also strengthened and nourished by others. When we sharpen and correct, we help each other flourish.\n\nIt’s interesting how it wasn’t enough for Apollos simply to be “competent” with Scripture (Acts 18:24). Notice how the text doesn’t say he was teaching inaccurately. Apollos was already familiar with the way of the Lord and was bold in sharing it. But his knowledge was somewhat limited. According to Acts, he “knew only John’s baptism” (v.25), so Aquila and Priscilla believed it was their responsibility to take him aside and fill in the gaps.\n\nCompetency is never a stopping point in the kingdom of God because He is always calling us into a deeper relationship with Him and one another. Through the Body of Christ, He partners with us to encourage each other more, teach each other more, and hold each other more accountable. We can count this as an honor. When we are obedient in exercising our spiritual gifts—especially when they stretch us outside of our comfort zones—we are grown and blessed as both the gift-bearer and the recipient.\n\nWhere can you speak truth in love? Who can you receive truth from in humility? Whether in the workplace or a car parked outside a coffee shop, there is life waiting for you. There is more.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nAround the age of eighteen, I remember praying for a mentor. I had no idea where to look for one, so soliciting God’s help felt like the right thing to do. Fast forward a few years, and I still hadn’t found one—at least not the formal, “let’s grab coffee every week and come with questions prepared” kind of relationship.\n\nA few weeks after visiting a new church, a lady who always gave out hugs and smelled like flower blossoms befriended me. She led the women’s ministry and loved hosting people around her dining table for prayer, Bible study, and honest conversations about wrestling through everyday life. Often, I would linger after everyone else went home, as we kept talking or laughing or drinking tea. There was nothing weird or formal about it—just normal time spent with someone who was genuinely interested in my life and relationship with Jesus.\n\nWe all need mutually life-giving spiritual friendships, and the apostle Paul was no exception. One reason why Paul hand-picked Timothy to be his companion was because of his top-notch reputation in the community. The young man was also a third-generation believer, resulting from a lineage of not one but two God-fearing female figures—a mother and grandmother (2Timothy 1:5). Having a mother who was Jewish positioned him well for ministry in a multicultural region of both Jews and Gentiles.\n\nI’m sure the legacy of Timothy’s faith was an advantage to being chosen as a companion, but it wasn’t enough simply for him to be familiar with Scripture (2Timothy 3:15); he needed to own his faith for himself. Later on in their partnership, Paul saw firsthand how the man had been personally transformed, and said, “I recall your sincere faith that first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and now, I am convinced, is in you also” (2Timothy 1:5).\n\nFor being just one man, his influence on Christianity and the canon of Scripture is pretty astounding. Being so interconnected to Paul’s ministry, Timothy either co-wrote or co-labored with his friend during the experiences captured within Paul’s letters. Ultimately, it was Timothy’s proven, trustworthy character and unmatched integrity that led Paul to trust him enough to lead and teach in his place (Philippians 2:22). They supported and helped each other grow, just as they did for the Church. This is why Paul referred to him as his “dearly loved and faithful child in the Lord” (1Corinthians 4:17).\n\nTimothy is a vibrant example of what it looks like to be mentored in the faith. The companionship we see modeled by these two men inspires us to seek out our own fellow sojourners in the faith, and in turn ask ourselves, Who am I investing in spiritually? Who am I allowing myself to be mentored by? How might God use my relationships for the flourishing of His Church? Spiritual mentorships don’t have to be rigid or classified as anything formal. They just have to draw us closer to Jesus and to one other.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Patti Sauls\n\nScripture Reading: Philemon 1:1-25, Colossians 3:22-25, Colossians 4:1-9, Romans 12:9-13\n\nWhen I engage with Paul’s letter to Philemon—a Christian who is also a slave owner—I want to be shielded from jarring talk of slavery, especially in the Bible. But nothing shielded the millions enslaved, past or present. We can’t look away from this brokenness in the world. We must consider what God is revealing through this letter about a runaway slave returning to his master.\n\nPaul was imprisoned in Rome when he wrote to Philemon, a friend and ministry partner in Colossae. Paul knew bondage and he knew the source of true freedom in Christ. He also lived in a time and place where slavery was society’s norm. Nearly one third of the Roman population was enslaved, which means master-slave dynamics were unavoidable. It’s essential to note that while Paul was describing and addressing an interpersonal conflict within the context of slavery, he was neither prescribing the system of slavery nor endorsing it as a good or godly practice.\n\nPhilemon’s runaway slave, Onesimus, had become a Christian through Paul’s ministry. He also became a faithful friend to Paul and could have continued living on the run, yet was compelled to return to Colossae and face his master. In preparation for Onesimus’s risky return, Paul sent Philemon a tactful letter, thanking him for being a faithful brother in Christ, and pressing him to further exercise his faith by extending brotherly love and acceptance to Onesimus.\n\nPaul urged Philemon to recognize and welcome Onesimus “no longer as a slave, but more than a slave—as a dearly loved brother” (Philemon 16). Requesting that the slave be treated as a brother was radical. Legally, Philemon could punish Onesimus or even kill him for running away. No one would expect him to treat his runaway slave with kindness, let alone regard him as kin. But the gospel calls for deep reconciliation that gives birth to liberation.\n\nAs Paul wrote to the church in Galatia, “There is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male and female; since you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28). All believers in Christ are family. None is superior to another, and none can “own” another. Furthermore, each of us has been on the run. Each of us has been a slave to sin. Each of us has been forgiven and reconciled to God through Jesus and set free. May this truth refresh our hearts (Philemon 20). Jesus is not ashamed to call us kin (Hebrews 2:11), and He welcomes us into a right, good, and eternal relationship with Him. May we also remind each other that we abide in this space together as equals, sisters and brothers united in Christ.\n\nPatti Sauls lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband Scott and daughters, Abby and Ellie, where they serve alongside the people of Christ Presbyterian Church. Prior to living in Nashville, the Sauls planted churches in Kansas City and Saint Louis and served at New York City’s Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nWhat do you do when God’s plans for your life unfold differently than you expected? \n\nThis question arises again and again throughout the Bible. Abraham is promised descendants, but then his wife is barren. Joseph is promised leadership, but then he is thrown into a pit. The disciples are promised a Messiah, but then He is arrested and killed.\n\nOver and over throughout the Bible, God’s people live in a tension between the promises of God and the reality of their present circumstances, and this tension is the context of Revelation.\n\nPrior to the writing of this book, the world had experienced an unprecedented outpouring of the Spirit of God. People saw miraculous signs and wonders. The gospel spread like wildfire. Thousands came to Christ. Lives were changed. It all must have felt fast and furious and wonderful.\n\nAnd then, as if someone had slowly turned off the faucet of God’s power, the revolution seemed to stall. In its place, persecution. Roman authorities increasingly pressured Christians to worship Caesar or face severe punishment. The hostility toward Christians intensified, and this left them wondering: \n\nWhere was God?  What happened to His promises? Is Jesus still coming back?  What do we do now?\n\nSooner or later, we all find ourselves in this place of uncertainty. We wonder if we misheard God or if we did something wrong to provoke Him—or if He is even there at all. And in this place of tension, it’s tempting for doubt to become our compass, instead of faith.\n\nThis is where the book of Revelation begins. The people of God are struggling, and the mission feels unclear. As a result, some Christians are compromising the truth of God’s Word and caving into the culture. Some are disobedient, while others are simply lukewarm. So God reiterates His promises with a “revelation” to John that is glorious and startling and surreal.\n\nIt’s easy to get lost in the imagery of this book, but the first chapter of Revelation holds the key. All we really need to know of “the First and the Last” (v.17) is that Jesus Himself is the definitive “revelation” for the world. Everything we need to know about God, we know through Christ. Everything we need to know about our past, we know through Christ. Everything we need to know about our future, we know through Christ. \n\nNot an inch of God’s Word or God’s plan is out of character with the Son of God, and this is the lens through which we should read everything contained in Revelation. It is tempting to be dogmatic about the meaning of these abstract images, but the point of this book is simple: to direct our trust toward the “Living One” who was dead and is now “alive forever and ever” (v.18).\n\nThis truth about Jesus—about His life, His death, and His resurrection—does not change with our circumstances or with our doubts. It holds. Whatever may come, Jesus is our unstoppable hope, from first to last. That is the message of Revelation, and the message for our lives.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\n“Things are getting worse and worse.”\n\nWhen we look at the news, the culture, the entertainment, and even the Church today, it’s easy to feel as if everything is slowly getting worse. It’s tempting to believe that the world is gradually unraveling, and that we are moving further away from truth, instead of toward it.\n\nWhenever we feel this cynicism begin to creep in, the temptation is to idealize the generations that have gone before us. We think, Our parents’ generation, our grandparents’ generation, the earliest Christians—they had it all together. Things weren’t as bad back then!\n\nI struggle with this mentality often. There are days when I feel jaded about Christians and about the Church. I log onto social media and see division and in-fighting, or I read about a pastor failing his congregation and his family. I see name-calling and judgment and the drawing of big, deep lines, and my heart wants to harden toward it all.\n\nOn those days when we are tempted to dismiss the world with a flick of the wrist, when we find ourselves looking down on other Christians who “aren’t doing it right,” and when we despair that the Church’s reputation is hopelessly smeared, Revelation 2–3 has a word for us.\n\nIn these chapters, written just a generation after Jesus’s resurrection, many churches are distracted and lost. Although they are working hard and striving to be faithful, God also levels the following charges against them: \n\nThey had forsaken their first love (2:4).\n\nThey participated in pagan rituals (2:14).\n\nThey were sexually immoral (2:14).\n\nThey embraced false teaching (2:15, 20).\n\nThey had a reputation of being alive, but they were dead (3:1).\n\nThey were lukewarm, neither hot nor cold (3:16).\n\nAll this, only sixty years after Jesus walked the earth.\n\nWhat this tells us is that the world is not simply getting worse, and neither is the Church. Following Jesus has always been hard. Faithfulness to God has always come unnaturally. Ever since sin entered the world, human nature has found it difficult to obey. \n\nAnd that is exactly why we need a Savior. \n\nThe good news of Jesus Christ begins with the bad news that we are broken. We have always been distracted. We have always resisted the truth. It was true two thousand years ago, and it is just as true today. Therefore, these letters to the seven churches in Asia minor are important for us as well. “Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches” (Revelation 2:29).\n\nBut our brokenness has never stopped God. Our division, our fighting, our apathy, our immorality, even our bad theology—none of it has ever stopped God. So when we read Revelation 2–3, we can do three things. First, we can remember that humanity is not getting worse, and neither is the Church—the temptation to turn away from God and His ways has always been there. Second, we can welcome this list of rebukes as an opportunity to identify our own areas of need. \n\nAnd finally, we can hope. In Revelation 3:19, God says, “Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline” (NIV). When we see darkness in the world—no matter how great—we don’t have to despair, and our hearts don’t have to grow hard. Instead, we can consider the possibility that God is allowing us to see these things, so that He can redeem them. \n\n",

As a child, I grew up watching the animated version of this tale, in which a lanky, awkward boy named Arthur unwittingly prepares to become king. Set in twelfth century England, the legend describes a country in turmoil, where the king has died without an heir to take his place. In order to resolve this dilemma, a wizard named Merlin places a sword in an anvil with the following words inscribed upon it: “Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise King born of all England.”\n\nAs the story goes, plenty of strong men and mighty warriors attempt to remove the sword, but every one of them fails. That is, until Arthur. This young, scrawny, misfit approaches the sword and is able to pull it from the anvil, finally restoring order to the kingdom.\n\nThe legend of Arthur is only a myth, but it echoes a story that is not. In chapters 4 and 5 of Revelation, we encounter a similar scene, but in place of a sword we have a scroll (5:1). We don’t know what exactly is inside the scroll, but New Testament scholar N.T. Wright speculates: “We rightly guess… that it contains God’s secret plan to undo and overthrow the world-destroying projects that have already gained so much ground, and to plant and nurture instead the world-rescuing project which will get creation itself back on track in the right direction.”\n\nMuch like the sword in the stone, what is significant about the scroll is not simply what is inside of it, but Who is able to unseal it. Like the sword, there is only one who is worthy to unleash its power. That chosen one, we soon discover, is Jesus—the “Lamb,” the “Root of David,” the “Lion from the tribe of Judah” (5:6,5). Christ alone can initiate God’s plan to rescue and redeem the world. \n\nThat is how the two stories are similar. This is how they differ:\n\nIn The Sword and the Stone, Arthur does nothing to earn the title of king. Although legend holds that he was secretly a royal heir, Arthur’s worthiness (much like Abraham, Moses, and David) comes solely from the fact that he is chosen for the task. He does not earn it, and he does not deserve it.\n\nChrist, on the other hand, is a different kind of hero. He is not simply plucked from thin air. Instead, the Lamb is worthy for two important reasons. First, He is worthy to redeem the brokenness of the world because He is the only one who did not contribute to it. And second, He is worthy to rescue humanity because He purchased us by His blood (5:9). \n\nUnlike most of our favorite heroes, Jesus was not chosen in spite of Himself. Even our greatest heroes, our noblest heroes, our most perfect heroes are still only a shadow of the Hero we have in Christ. By virtue of His identity and by the power of His blood, He alone is able to open the scroll and initiate God’s plan to redeem the world.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nEvery year, wildfires break out on America’s west coast, decimating forests and grasslands, threatening homes, and turning the sunset skies into a haze of pink. The power of fire is terrifying and awesome, and we’ve all seen the danger it poses to homes and lives in its path. While fire holds a mighty power for destruction, the land on the west coast actually needs a certain amount of these fires; they clean forest floors, pare down the plants that consume the water, kill plant diseases, and release seeds from trees that require fire to start the next generation. Don’t let the power and terror of fire mask the severe good that it serves.\n\nThe coming of God’s judgment is a terror to the wicked, but it is a comfort to His children. God’s judgment is not blind punishment. It is the setting right of all things. God comes to judge sin and avenge injustice. And in Scripture we see that He holds back judgment for a time so that many more might come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). To those who trust in Him, His judgment is a refining fire that strips away sin and removes the sting of death. God’s judgment sets the world right again.\n\nHe comes to undo the curse and make all things new. God’s judgment carries this beautiful promise: “They will no longer hunger; they will no longer thirst; the sun will no longer strike them, nor will any scorching heat” (Revelation 7:16). What a joyful declaration! Our king will take away the curse of sin and death and bring us to a place of satiety and comfort. I love that the God of the universe cares whether or not I’m hungry or too hot. Our personal comfort seems so small on the universal scale of things. God’s concern for even our thirst is an indication of His tender, personal love.\n\nGod’s final judgment comes to reveal His reign. For all things are His. The whole book of Revelation (indeed the whole canon of Scripture) is about Christ, and this is what it says about Him: He’s seated on a throne (v.17); He is wise and powerful, never caught off guard (v.12 ); He shelters us, and we are safe in Him (v.15); and His gospel is true (v.10).\n\nThe burning fire of God’s judgment is unquestionably a terror to those who do not know Him. But to those who are called by His name—to His own children—the coming of His judgment heralds the setting right of all things. He comes to rescue His children and bring them home.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThe language in today’s passage is full of rich imagery: a flaming mountain is thrown into the sea, a third of the stars are blackened, and crowned locusts ride horses with scorpion tails into battle. It’s both chillingly specific and massively cryptic—and why are there seven seals, anyway? Before we get carried away, we have to remember that Scripture must first be interpreted through the lens of Scripture. So where else in Scripture do we see the number seven? It’s a parallel to the seven days of creation, the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, Jacob’s seven years of service to Laban, the seven trumpets of Jericho, etc. In God’s Word, seven is a number of completion.\n\nIn all the swirling imagery, the central purpose of all Scripture is to teach the good news of the gospel: Christ has come to save. And the whole book of Revelation is just the same. These judgments show us the completion of God’s good work. And the end purpose of God’s work of salvation is that He should abide with us, and we with Him. He is our God, and we are His people.\n\nBecause we are His, we can rejoice at His coming, and at the restoration of righteousness. Judgment must come. Justice is necessary because He is justice. He will make all things right. He will not allow wickedness to go on forever. \n\nGod’s judgment is total, and our only escape is Jesus. For those of us in Christ, our judgment was paid by Christ at the cross. The weight of our judgment has already fallen on Him. Therefore, we should rejoice at God’s coming judgment, because it will restore righteousness.\n\nWe are His, and so we need not fear any present tribulation. The consequences of evil in this world are scary, and the threat to believers is real. But the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous (1 Peter 3:12). He is always with us, and He cares for us. His ears are open to our prayers, and He is not indifferent to our cries. Even in judgment, God is merciful to those who love Him. \n\nWe need not fear, because we are His. Instead, we can be people of hope, joy, and peace. This is cause for great rejoicing. His justice is ongoing, and this passage is not the final judgment but a picture of God’s ongoing work in the world. He is constantly doling out mercy to us, deferring judgment, calling us back to Him. His work is not done in our families or in our communities. Therefore, have hope for your children, for your parents, and for your neighbors who are not yet believers. God is constantly at work.\n\n",

Summering at the north pole, they enjoy weeks of 24-hour sunlight, and at the other end of their migration, they bask in the same full-sun days at the south pole. They literally chase summer all over the globe. If it weren’t so hard, we might all be tempted to do it—imagine a beautiful summer that never ends.\n\nThe point of the whole book of Revelation is the glory of Christ. His glory is so big and so wonderful that I have to imagine endless, gorgeous, sunshine-filled days to get in the right frame of mind. We can’t even grasp what it would be like to live in the glow of His glory, but I know that it will be good. So good.\n\nWe get a glimpse of His glory in the mighty angel standing astride sea and land in today’s reading (Revelation 10:5). Based on the being’s majestic description, many commentators believe this “angel” to be Christ Himself. Regardless of one’s interpretation of this particular passage, however, the whole of Scripture points to this beautiful truth: Christ is worthy. The end result of the judgment and war brings us back to where we began: the Word made flesh mercifully for us.\n\nBecause Christ is worthy, we know that the nations and kingdoms of this world are only temporary. God’s kingdom is the only one that will last. The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever (Revelation 11:15). Christ receives all the kingdoms as His inheritance, which He delivers to the Father (1 Corinthians 15:24–28). And for those who love and trust in Him, the eternal kingdom becomes our inheritance in Christ (1 Peter 1:3–5).\n\nFinally, God finishes His work. “Then he said to me, ‘It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end’” (Revelation 21:6). There is no stopping or undoing what God has done. Our redemption is sure and complete in Christ. And He will bring to completion the work of sanctification and glorification when He comes again. And so we pray: “Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10).\n\nIn Revelation we see Christ, fully worthy and glorified. He is the beginning and the end of all our stories. And we will bask in the warmth and light of His glory for all eternity. It is more than I can imagine. Come quickly, Lord Jesus!\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nOne of my favorite hymns is “For All the Saints.” I was reminded of it when reflecting on today’s reading. Every verse of the song compels us to cling to “our Rock, our Fortress,” and “our Captain” in the battle, as we keep our eyes trained toward a more glorious day yet to come. It echoes this truth from Revelation: God is and forever will be seated on His throne, and all the heavenly hosts give glory, honor, and thanks to Him. The hymn continues:\n\nAnd when the strife is fierce, the warfare long; Steals on the ear the distant triumph song.  And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.  Alleluia! Alleluia!\n\nThe strife really is fierce, and it has been since the serpent sowed deceit and destruction in the garden of Eden. Our fear of God, alienation from Him and one another, deceit and pride and endless greed—these things tore the fabric of our human existence before the curse was pronounced upon the serpent. \n\nAnd yet in the midst of Genesis 3, God declared a message of hope that has echoed throughout human history: the offspring of the woman would one day “crush” the serpent’s head (v.15). True, the serpent would “crush” (yes, it’s the same word in Hebrew) the heel of Eve’s offspring—a lethal blow, but one that would end in the greatest, most victorious event in human history: the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. \n\nThat malevolent serpent has since donned many hideous characteristics, and Revelation 12 does not mince words when describing the evil one. We read that the “great fiery red dragon” has been intent on devouring the woman (representing Israel, God’s people) and her Son, Jesus the Messiah. There is an appallingly fierce war in the heavenly realms, one we can hardly imagine. The grim powers of evil and the mighty forces of good tangle with each other. The dragon is identified as the ancient serpent, the devil, who leads the whole world astray. This is serious in the extreme, not to be dismissed with a wave of our enlightened hand. (We often do that.)\n\nIn other words, our battle here on earth is not done. We face the rage of the devil who knows his time is short and his end sure (v.12). But we also know the perspective from God’s throne:\n\nThen I heard a loud voice in heaven say, “The salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have now come, because the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night,  has been thrown down” (v.10).\n\nAs painful as our suffering here on earth is, victory is ours by the blood of the Lamb (v.11). We are empowered by and rest in the assurance that God has made us alive in Christ, that Lamb sitting on the throne. His shed blood has cancelled out the debt we owe, and the enemy has been disarmed completely. The serpent’s head has been crushed at the cross (Colossians 2:13–15). \n\nAlleluia indeed. \n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nThere is just no way around it. The apocalyptic scene described in Revelation 13 is horrifying. It appears that every possible embodiment of sheer evil will be turned loose on the world—particularly against those who “hold firmly” to the testimony of Jesus (12:17). Add to that, supernatural deception and oppressive brutality will be the all-encompassing order of the day (13:13–17). Everything is utter calamity. How can we possibly face the prospect of such disasters? I don’t know about you, but I’d prefer to simply disappear before the catastrophe begins.\n\nBut what about today, here and now? As we consider our own times, what can we say to encourage God’s people who are currently facing such ferocious animosity? How do we pray for believers whose lives are threatened day in and day out by vicious, nearly unimaginable manifestations of hatred? While Revelation 13 may be part of a much more comprehensive and sober glimpse into the future, there are also crucial lessons for us today.\n\nBottom line for now: there are no easy answers when God’s people are faced with cruel injustices. There are no detours around the painful suffering brought about by those who practice evil. Instead, “this calls for endurance and faithfulness from the saints” (13:10). We are called to stand with those who are subjected to persecution, insults, and unjust treatment (Hebrews 10:33–34). \n\nAnd how can we best do that? With fervent intercessory prayer. Scripture tells us that God is always with us, but with fervent intercessory prayer, we can pray for His presence to be known and felt by those who suffer. We can cry out on their behalf, asking God to grant them peace. \n\nIn talking with friends and acquaintances whose suffering makes my own experiences pale in comparison, I have been both humbled and amazed by what their words have in common. As a result of their truly grim circumstances, they have come to know a deeper intimacy with God. May such be true for all of us!\n\nIt’s difficult to pray well, but it’s important to proclaim God’s “great and precious promises” (2 Peter 1:4) on behalf of those who need endurance for each coming hour. May they (and we) be assured that the One who is coming will not delay (Hebrews 10:37) and that there awaits us “a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 1:11, NIV). We cling to these truths even when everything else seems to give way at the very foundations (Psalm 46). \n\nThat “rich welcome” that awaits God’s faithful and enduring people has stayed generations of believers. The book of Hebrews assures us that we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses as we run the race set before us. I like to think of them cheering on God’s faithful people as we feebly struggle, yet keeping our eyes on “the source and perfecter of our faith” (Hebrews 12:1–2). \n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Elaine A. Phillips\n\nThe thundering voice from heaven.The new song before God’s throne.The proclamation of the eternal gospel across the globe.\n\nIn reading Revelation 14, we begin to hear the echoes of hope, when each mighty angel from the heavenly realms announces that the final hour of judgment has come. We’re told there will be harvests—first the reaping of ripe grain and then the gathering of clusters of grapes for the winepress, God’s wrath. And while the image of God’s wrath and judgment seems unimaginable and terrifying, it’s actually good news: Those who’ve worshiped the beast, the embodiment of evil, and carried out his vicious schemes will one day drink the wine of God’s wrath (14:9–11).\n\nWine is an image reverberating out from Old Testament prophets (Isaiah 51:17–23; Jeremiah 25:15–31; Habakkuk 2:16), through Psalm 75:7–8, and into the garden of Gethsemane (Matthew 26). It’s there that Jesus, knowing full well what was coming, prayed that the “cup” might be taken from Him. Then in utter and complete submission to the perfect will of His Father, He said, “Yet not as I will, but as you will,” and took in the full cup of God’s righteous wrath (v.39).\n\nBut as the redeemed, we have hope, and this is where our hope lies: with the victorious Lamb who takes away the sin of the world and rescues us from God’s coming wrath (John 1:29; 1 Thessalonians 1:10). Until that day, we are called to remain faithful and endure (Revelation 14:12). Death has not yet been dealt its final lethal blow, but in the meantime, we trust in the promise that those saints “who die in the Lord” will one day find “rest from their labors” (v.13). \n\nLooking forward, the author of Hebrews assures us that we are headed for the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the living God. We are headed to the welcome of thousands upon thousands of the angelic host, as well as other believers, whose names are written in heaven. It’s there that Jesus, our perfect Mediator, faithfully intercedes for us, even today (Hebrews 12:22–24).\n\nSo let those who have been redeemed from the hand of the enemy—those gathered from all the lands, east, west, north, and south—give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! (Psalm 107:1–3). Let those from every nation, tribe, language, and people join in a mighty chorus of praise for the Lamb who has overcome. And let us join as a mighty chorus, praising and worshiping “the one who made the heaven and earth” and then redeemed them for eternity (Revelation 14:7).\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nWhen it comes to how to respond to the righteous judgment of God, we only have two options. We can worship in wonder or we can wave a rebel fist. There is no middle ground, no gray area, no third option. Just worship or rebellion, reverence or revolt. \n\nHere, in Revelation 15–16 we see a picture of the wrath of God poured out. It’s a terrifying image, bowls filled to the brim with the righteous judgment of God. As squeamish as God’s wrath may make us, deep down, we know He is justified. We look around at mankind and inwardly at our own wicked hearts and must repeat the cry of heaven: \n\n“They deserve it!”…  “Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, True and just are your judgments” (Revelation 16:6–7).\n\nNotice that in these passages, no one is arguing with God’s justice. No scales are needed to weigh and consider the justice of God. Over and over we read that these grisly judgments are in line with a fair and true God. This is justice in its purest form. And yet it’s possible, even when His justice is deserved and devastating, to choose insurrection over His goodness and mercy. Though the judgments certainly take center stage here, there is still an undercurrent of the people’s rebellion within these passages:\n\nThey “blasphemed the name of God… and they did not repent and give him glory” (v.9). They “blasphemed the God of heaven… they did not repent of their works” (v.11).They “blasphemed God” (v.21).\n\nConsider those pummeled by the final bowl of wrath. Though buried under hailstones weighing a hundred pounds, they still shook rebel fists at God. If we are honest with our own hearts, we see that our own rebellious streak runs just as deep. Our own eye for justice is just as distorted. \n\nBut God, in His infinite mercy has unclenched our rebel fists. We are shielded from God’s ultimate judgment and are now “hidden with Christ in God” (Colossians 3:3). Instead of continuing in rebellion, God’s grace has taught us to respond like Israel when the nation witnessed God’s wrath on Pharaoh and His men. \n\n“Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord. They said:\n\n ‘I will sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted; he has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea… \n\nLORD, who is like you among the gods?\n\nWho is like you, glorious in holiness,\n\nrevered with praises, performing wonders?’” (Exodus 15:1,11). \n\nGod’s righteous wrath isn’t all penned up for the Day of Judgment. Even now He judges the wicked. Even now He has the right to rule our hearts and lives. When face to face with His judgment we only have two options. Because He is so worthy, may we choose to worship the God who is just. \n\n",

I am confident he wasn’t zeroed in on our current political climate when he described worldly leaders who were morally bankrupt and drunk on power. And yet, the shoe fits, doesn’t it? Sadly, since the fall of humanity in the garden of Eden, this shoe always seems to fit. \n\nHere in Revelation 17, we see humankind’s perversion of power personified in the prostitute. She is dressed to impress and mired in scandal. She is greedy, flashy, and horrid. I find it hard to look away. This passage has plenty of mysteries, and I won’t claim to understand them all. But life on planet earth has trained me to recognize the distorting effects of power. She is every ruler who has ever reigned and every heart twisted and broken by sin. \n\nShe is presidents and prime ministers, congressmen and counselors. She embodies parents and principals, laws and limitations. But one thing she is not—she is not the Lamb of God. Neither is the beast who is with her. Their rule and reign is fleeting. With that in mind, look closely at how the beast is described: \n\n“The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up from the abyss and go to destruction. Those who live on the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast that was, and is not, and is to come” (Revelation 8, emphasis mine).\n\nStack those words up against these descriptions of Jesus (again, emphasis mine): \n\n“Grace and peace to you from the one who is, who was, and who is to come” (Revelation 1:4).\n\n“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “the one who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty” (Revelation 1:8). \n\n“Each of the four living creatures had six wings; they were covered with eyes around and inside. Day and night they never stop, saying,\n\nHoly, holy, holy,Lord God, the Almighty,who was, who is, and who is to come” (Revelation 4:8). \n\nThe beast will reign until he doesn’t. The prostitute may have a moment in the limelight, but she cannot diminish the Light of the World by a single lumen. Every leader who has ever ruled, every king who has ever been crowned, every circumstance that has ever terrorized you—all will come to an end. But Christ will remain. Only His throne is established forever. \n\nPolitical leaders aren’t the only ones with power over me. If I keep looking inward, at my own power-hungry heart, I see some of me in the prostitute as well. I keep clawing my way back onto the throne that sits in my heart. I keep trying to take control away from the only One who is worthy to rule. Yet, the reign of sin will not last forever inside of me because brokenness won’t always be king of this world. \n\nBecause of Jesus, sin’s power is not ultimate. Sin was, but will be no more. Only the spotless Lamb and His Bride will remain. Long live the King of kings! \n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nTheologians with far more degrees on their walls and books on their shelves than I have can continue to debate who Babylon represents in Revelation 18. I simply don’t have the brain cells to compete. But because of the wisdom granted by the Holy Spirit, I do have what it takes to read this passage and consider this question: Where is the redemptive hand of God in these verses?\n\nThe fall of Babylon, like so much of John’s revelation, is mysterious, but when we take a closer look, we see that the gospel thread is clearly present. God’s redemptive work, which stitches all of His Word together, is beautifully and unmistakably revealed throughout this book. \n\nConsider the angel’s loud declaration, “It has fallen, Babylon the Great has fallen!” (Revelation 18:2). And then compare that declaration to Christ’s quiet resolve at the crucifixion: “When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, ‘It is finished.’ Then bowing his head, he gave up his spirit” (John 19:30). \n\nBecause of what He accomplished on the cross, all evil will crumble, every Babylon will fall, all “injustice [will shut] its mouth” (Psalm 107:42). Anything that opposes God will fall. Babylon’s sins were piled up to heaven—so were mine, so were yours—“and God remembered her crimes” (Revelation 18:5). As well He should have. But our transgressions? Our sins? He has forgotten them. \n\n“For I will forgive their wrongdoing, and I will never again remember their sins” (Hebrews 8:12).\n\nI have to remind myself often that God won’t dredge my sin back up. Not now. Not ever. Babylon’s ending is not my own. My sins have been thrown into the depths of the sea. I will receive undeserved grace, but Babylon will receive deserved destruction, paid according to her works of evil, and therefore, earning a double portion of wrath. \n\nBut “He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began” (2 Timothy 1:9). We are spared because of Christ’s work—not punished according to our own. \n\nGod certainly could have wiped me out forever. Instead, He has rebuilt my life on the precious cornerstone of His grace. And so as Christ-followers, we are to “rejoice… because God has pronounced on [Babylon] the judgment she passed” on us (Revelation 18:20).\n\nWicked Babylon is a picture of the enemy’s schemes. Seemingly secure in his triumph, fortified by the forces of darkness, for a fleeting moment he, too, appeared untouchable. And yet, our enemy has fallen. Call it out in a mighty voice! In a single hour he became a defeated foe (v.17). In a moment, with the flash of an angel, the stone rolled away, and evil crumbled. God’s plans for our redemption could not be stopped. Not then. Not now. Not ever.\n\nThe world may weep and mourn when evil crumbles, but heaven will always rejoice. Ours is a God who triumphs over evil. He redeems us for His glory. \n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nAs most brides do, I had high hopes (and perhaps delusions) that my wedding day would be perfect. For me, it almost was. Almost. \n\nOn a steamy Saturday in May 2001, Chad and I were preparing for our big day. My bridesmaids and I drove to the church and went to the make-shift bridal suite to start getting ready. I don’t remember how long we there before one of my bridesmaids came in and said, “Whit, you need to get upstairs because there’s a massive storm headed our way. If we don’t get you into the sanctuary now, you may have to walk in the rain.”\n\nThe church where we were getting married had two separate buildings. And there wasn’t a way for me to get from where I was to the vestibule, where I would walk down the aisle, unless I went outside. This was our window to avoid the storm, and we needed to go now. \n\nWe gathered up all our stuff and made the trek up to the sanctuary. The gorgeous blue sky that had welcomed us earlier when we first arrived was now hidden by ominous, dark clouds. Yes, a storm was imminent. Happy wedding day to us.\n\nWe piled into the foyer, but quickly realized that it wouldn’t do for the bride to be standing there greeting all the guests when they arrived. The only option we had was to file into the ladies’ restroom. It was like a bad joke: “How do you fit a bride and ten bridesmaids into a bathroom the size of a mid-size sedan?” As it turns out, not easily. \n\nI spent my last hour of single life stuffed into a church bathroom. But through it all though, my bridesmaids— my best friends dressed in sea-foam green (bless them!)—were so kind, faithful, funny, and selfless. Missi, my college roommate, had me laughing. Meredith, my soon- to-be sister-in-law, kept refilling my water. Lori and Ashley were loyal lookouts, reporting back to me who had just arrived. It’s now one of the sweetest memories of my wedding day, each of my friends making sure in her own way that I was wedding-day ready—the most beautiful, confident version of myself I could be. \n\nThe Church, the global and eternal collection of God’s people, is Christ’s Bride, and her wedding day is fast approaching. Despite the gathering clouds of external opposition and internal grumbling, all who are made alive in Christ—single, married, divorced, or widowed—need to be doing our part to make Her wedding-day ready. \n\nIt is theologically true that we, the Church, are the Bride of Christ, beautiful and beloved by Jesus Christ, our Bridegroom (Revelation 21:2). And one day, our wedding and reception, called the marriage supper of the Lamb, will be the most perfect, extravagant party you can imagine (19:6–10). \n\nHowever, I think in some ways we serve another wedding day role: that of bridesmaids. Part of our job is to make sure that the Bride is as lovely and wedding-day ready as she can be. Our goal is for the Bride to look radiant. We are partly responsible for what those outside the Christian faith think of the Bride. \n\nThat might sound good, but maybe you haven’t seen much of the resplendent Bride. Perhaps you’ve been bulldozed by a bit of a Bridezilla instead. And to that, I can relate all too well; I know the pain the Church can inflict. I truly, truly do. But while she may be messy, she is also redeemed. \n\nEven when our hurts are legitimately and deeply wounded, our challenge is to remember that Jesus loves His Bride. He doesn’t ignore her flaws or shortcomings, and He never, ever condones abuse of any kind—but make no mistake, Christ loves the Church He died to save.\n\nToday, we are standing in the vestibule of human history. We can’t know for sure when the doors will swing open and we’ll see Jesus coming for us. Between now and then, let’s do all we can to be ready for our Bridegroom.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nAs the consummation of redemptive history unfolds, God’s plan is nearly complete, and Revelation 21 and 22 tell us what will be regained and restored. But at this point in the narrative, it’s helpful to remind ourselves not just what we will gain, but what will be lost. \n\nIn the first garden, when sin entered the world, perfection was broken, marred and spoiled. A seemingly unbridgeable chasm was created between what God had intended and what humanity would now experience. Perfection was made imperfect. The devastating effect of our rebellion was all-encompassing, wrecking ourselves, our relationships, and creation. Nothing was left untouched. \n\nSin is the most aggressive of cancers. Let’s look at a few of its fatal symptoms.\n\nSin separates. The first and most catastrophic effect of the fall was how sin destroyed our intimacy with our Creator. Once His friends, we became His enemies. No longer able to enjoy intimate, unbroken fellowship with God, we hid. And as a result of our sin, we were ejected from the garden. In His mercy, God spared Adam and Eve from staying in Eden and eating from the tree of life, which would have left us forever broken (Genesis 3:22–24).\n\nSin sentences us to death. Expelled from Eden, humanity was lost, but not beyond restoration. There is hope for the fallen, but we are not spared death, which is the second consequence of sin. Every person will succumb. No one can escape it. Our bodies are breaking down. Death looms for us and our loved ones. Though we will be raised to life in Christ, most of us will mourn many times over before we see our Maker. Death, mourning, crying, and pain are the result of the fall, full of emotions we were never meant to experience. \n\nSin spoils everything. Not only does sin separate and sentence us to death, it spoils and ruins. Eden was pristine, peace-filled, and perfect. After the fall, what would have been eternally new was now destined for decay. Creation was fractured, and humanity was plunged into conflict with the rest of God’s creatures. Now creation groans and travails awaiting the restoration of what was lost. \n\nThis is the backdrop of Revelation 21. Separation. Ruin. Decay. Death. God isn’t just creating a new heaven and a new earth, glorious as that is. No, He is restoring perfection, ridding us of all the residue and side-effects of sin. Look at what He promises.\n\nWhat sin had separated, God rejoins. For the ancient Near East, water, particularly the sea, represented chaos and danger. Our new heaven and earth won’t have a sea. More profoundly, the chasm between Creator and creation has been closed. God now dwells with His people in a world where sin, decay, and death are no more. Where we once were destined for cyclical mourning, pain, and grief, we are now promised the joy and comfort of dwelling with God forever.\n\nWe were Adam and Eve’s co-conspirators, and we have lived with a death sentence ever since. But our God is now making all things new, putting an end to all that was broken. What we had forfeited, He has restored. \n\nHe was there at the beginning, our Alpha. And He is now standing at the End, our Omega. What He started, He is gloriously finishing.\n\n",

        "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Whitney Capps\n\nRevelation 21 and 22 paint a lovely picture of the promised end of our story, but we are not home yet. Our destination is certain and secure, but friend, we have not arrived. There is still work to be done.\n\nBelievers living on this side of the cross live in a tenuous “now” and “not yet.” Because of the resurrection of Jesus and the indwelling of His Holy Spirit, we can experience some of the kingdom now. The fruit of the Spirit is a present promise for those of us who surrender to His Lordship. We can enjoy and display love, joy, peace, patience, and kindness today.\n\nWe can grieve in a unique and gospel-centered way. We do not grieve as those who have no hope (1 Thessalonians 4:13). We mourn, but we are comforted by the hope of heaven. We can live in a fallen and fractured world without succumbing to fear or a fatalistic perspective that nothing can redeem the brokenness around us. \n\nThe call to persevere is the command for us to live as sojourners who are passing through to our eternal Promised Land. But we don’t fix our eyes on Jesus, the author, source, and perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:2), to the exclusion of others. We cannot ignore those around us. Not at all. I believe this is why Christ commanded John to write instructions for God’s people before He unfolded what was coming. Revelation opens with a clarion call to the Church, and the letters to the seven churches (Revelation 2–3) should still be the filter through which we view this “end.” We have a job to do, and Jesus expects us to do it well. \n\nWe must persevere in the face of crushing secularism and punishing persecution, passionately clinging to the gospel. When we persevere, we live with the same kind of urgency that moved Jesus to say, “I am coming soon!” (Revelation 22:7). We stay mindful that none of us—not our lost neighbor, sinful co-worker, or rebellious family member—is promised tomorrow. We and the strangers all around us are walking toward a sure judgment. One day grief will be no more, but that day is not today. However, grief does serve a purpose. It arrests our hearts with compassion and compels us to action. We ought to grieve what is coming and then live a life that proclaims the hope that Jesus’s death and resurrection secured. \n\nYes, the kingdom is both now and not yet for you and me. We can experience it now, and we must proclaim it to those who have not yet received it. And whether they persist in doing evil, as Jesus says in Revelation 22, we stay the course in faithfully preaching of the gospel in word and deed. We preach it now because His return is not yet. There is still time, and we must steward it well.\n\n",
