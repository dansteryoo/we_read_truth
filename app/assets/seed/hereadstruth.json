    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The book of Genesis ends with two graves. By the look of the chapters leading up to this point, it would have been easy to imagine this book ending with many more—Joseph repaying his brothers for their treachery against him, especially after his father Jacob died. But no. Joseph chose kindness. Why? Because he came from somewhere, and that mattered.\nA few years ago, I went back to my hometown to visit to my grandfather’s grave. As I passed the rows of headstones, a strange grief came over me. It wasn’t a sorrow for my grandfather. It was a homesickness triggered by the names carved in the granite markers—names as common to me as Smith or Johnson, but unique to rural Indiana: Tragesser, Ribperger, Tebbe, and Schmidt. I came from somewhere. Those were my people.\nTwo graves. Jacob and Joseph, are laid to rest. When Jacob dies, his body is embalmed like Egyptian royalty, an honor given because of what his son Joseph meant to Egypt. But Jacob didn’t want to be interred in Egypt. He wanted his body to be laid to rest in the cave at Machpelah, where his grandfather Abraham buried his beloved Sarah. Jacob wanted his bones to lie with his family.\nLet’s take a minute to go back and remember how this book began. It began with our first parents walking with God in the garden in the cool of the day. But then they rebelled against God and the bottom fell out. Death entered, waters covered the earth, and people scattered. But just when it seemed the world would be lost to chaos, God sent Abraham and Sarah out to the land the Lord had promised to give them. Abraham’s first and only official acquisition of that land was this cave where he buried his wife.\nNow Jacob’s children were to carry his body back to that place. The story is beautiful and sad, and yet filled with hope because Jacob’s request is born out of a conviction that he belongs someplace, that he comes from somewhere. Abraham’s grave is a symbol of belonging. It binds his descendants together in life and in death.\nThe book of Genesis was written to let us know we come from somewhere, and we belong to Someone. Death entered the world early, but this book spins us forward into a story where light pushes back the darkness, where life carries on beyond the grave, and where God claims a people who have rejected Him.\nWe come from somewhere. The promise of life in Christ is that we, too, will one day be gathered with our forefathers. The difference is that we will not be gathered to them in death, but in life, and for eternity.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    My grandparents on my mother’s side met on the Staten Island Ferry. They both lived on Staten Island and worked similar shifts at different places in Manhattan. One day, George noticed Norma. Then another day, he noticed her again. Then he tried to make sure he was on the same ferry so the frequency of seeing one another would open a door for him to speak to her. Then one day he did.\nThe ripple effect of him noticing her all those years ago is hard to quantify, but fun to think about. Had he not said “hello,” my mom never would have met my dad because she wouldn’t exist. And neither would I, or any of my kids (except the awesome boy we adopted). My grandfather’s simple decision to say “hello” to a pretty girl set in motion so many beautiful outcomes—and many tragic ones too. That’s nothing compared to the decision Jacob makes in today’s passage.\nThe promised land is crumbling under the dry rot of a severe famine, and Jacob’s lost-and-found son Joseph has invited the family to move down to Egypt, where there would be food and a place for them to wait it out. The Lord told him, “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there. I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you back” (Genesis 46:3–4). Talk about a loaded promise.\nPicture Jacob sending word to his clan to gather up their things. Picture them rallying for departure—the first clip-clop of a hoof headed south to cross the Sinai Peninsula like a locomotive making that first lurch forward, pulling an entire nation behind. They had no idea what would come of that journey.\nThis is what would happen: they would settle in Goshen and become the enslaved nation Moses would lead out hundreds of years later. They would wander in the wilderness for forty years, following the pillar of cloud by day and fire by night. They would see Moses coming down from the mountain, ablaze with the glory of God, carrying His law on stone tablets. They would cross the Jordan, take the promised land back, and from Jacob’s line, the Messiah would be born.\nSo much pivoted on the fulcrum of this decision to follow the Lord to an unknown land. So much would come of it. To the ordinary person living within the limits of this world, so many situations turn in a way that might seem hopeless. But, as Joseph would later say, what man intends for evil, the Lord uses for good (Genesis 50:20). Our God is never out of control.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In seventh grade, I told my mom that I didn’t think my dad loved me. His offense? He wouldn’t let me stay out past ten o’clock. I remember this moment because of the way my mom rose up with a fury like Galadriel’s when Frodo offered her the ring, which clearly let me know I’d crossed a line. I didn’t know how hard my dad worked, or how much he sacrificed for me. I couldn’t see my sin—not with any clarity, anyway.\nLife has a way of bringing clarity. Now that I have an adult relationship with my father, and now that I have children of my own, I understand better the depth of my father’s love. I needed an awakening. Today’s passage reads like an awakening to me.\nJoseph set his brothers up. There’s no other way to say it. He set them up. He hid his gold cup in young Benjamin’s saddlebag, and while his brothers were on their way home, he sent soldiers to chase them down and conduct a search of their belongings, knowing it would rattle them.\nWhy did Joseph do this? We’re not given any one reason, but when we read how the story unfolds, we see that his plan woke something up in them. When Joseph told his brothers he was going to make Benjamin his slave, they pleaded for Benjamin’s return—not for Benjamin’s sake but for their father’s. They told Joseph that their father loved the boy, and that he’d already lost his other favored son. Jacob told them that the other son this wife bore to him (Joseph himself) left and was probably torn apart by beasts. If he lost Benjamin, too, Jacob said, it would be the final beat of his grief-stricken heart (Genesis 44:29).\nAs the brothers pleaded for Benjamin’s return, they wept because of their father’s sorrow. This display of love for Jacob broke Joseph’s heart because it was a love he shared. This was when he revealed his true identity. And when the brothers recognized Joseph, they trembled, possibly because young men don’t often see the weight of their sins until they’re older. But now they could see the mess they made of their family, and they better understood what it cost.\nJoseph tells them to go bring their father. He wants them near. And isn’t it just like God to stir us awake to sins we didn’t have eyes to see when we were younger? But it’s also like God to tell us to draw near to Him while the restoration process takes place, which sometimes takes years.\nGod does not abandon us to our own spiritual poverty; He draws us to Himself. But in that process, He often mercifully decides to show us the depths of our need that we could not see when we were younger. When He does this, it is not because He is ruining us—it is because He is saving us.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Do you presume that for every trouble you face, there should come an equal blessing? Have you tried to live by this math? In the words of Shakespeare’s King Lear, “That way madness lies.”\nIn many ways, western Christianity has come to regard struggle as incompatible with the life God intends for us. But when we look at people in the Bible—in both the Old Testament and the New—we see that their lives were full of trouble.\nThink about it. Adam was kicked out of the garden. Noah’s entire world was destroyed. Moses’s anger kept him from entering the promised land. David had an affair with his friend’s wife and then had his friend killed. Peter and Paul were both imprisoned and later martyred. John was exiled to Patmos. In this world, they all had trouble, and so shall we. And nowhere are we promised that our troubles in this life will be balanced with blessing.\nJoseph’s life is the story of one trouble after another. After he was sold into slavery by his jealous brothers, he came to be respected by his new master, Potiphar. But then Potiphar’s wife tried to seduce Joseph, and later claimed that he tried to rape her, which got Joseph thrown into prison.\nBut in prison, Joseph was found to have the ability to interpret dreams. So when Pharaoh began having nightmares, Joseph interpreted the king’s dreams, and in the process, ended up saving both Egypt and his own family from famine and ruin. As a result, Joseph earned both the respect and confidence of the Pharaoh, who made Joseph his second in command over all Egypt.\nAt this point, we might be tempted to say, “See. After all his trouble, things worked out.” But remember, Joseph’s exaltation in Egypt came at great personal cost. And because it did, his story frees us from the madness of trying to balance out all the bad things that happen in this world with the good.\nIn this world we will have both blessing and trouble. Jesus told us this (John 16:33). And trouble and blessing will not always appear to be in balance. That doesn’t matter. Joseph’s position of power in Egypt, as glorious as it was at the time, was never meant to last. And here is where we’re like Joseph; we are not meant to be prisoners of this world, nor are we to be her kings. We were made for another world—one built on the grace of God in Christ, which was preserved through both Joseph’s exaltation and his troubles.\nThis world is out of balance. But take heart. Christ has overcome the world.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Joe was one of my best friends during my college years. He was a few years older than me. Our friendship didn’t begin until after he graduated, but as a high school freshman, I looked up to him when he was a senior. Joe came to faith in Christ after he graduated, which was the beginning of our friendship; we were part of the same church. He stood up at my wedding, and I at his.\nPeople loved Joe. They admired him. Joe was magnetic. Talented. Fun. Popular. Good at almost everything he set his hand to. When I read about Joseph in Genesis, I think of Joe. Here is a guy who just seemed to fall backward into blessing and favor. But then came his suffering. My friend Joe’s suffering was not being sold into slavery. His suffering was a cancer that took his life.\nBut what I saw in Joe, I also see in the story of Joseph—that even in the darkest, hardest times, the Lord was near. My friend’s last days showed a man who knew, loved, trusted, and rested in his Lord.\nJoseph in Genesis lives an incredibly complicated story of suffering and triumph, of landing on rock bottom only to rise to the top, of being cut off from his family to one day saving their lives. He had all these negative things going on: situations beyond his control, servitude he could not walk away from, people falsely accusing him of crimes that could cost him his life.\nI can only imagine what it would have been like living in Potiphar’s house. Joseph was there because he was sold into slavery. He was in a low position, but he rose from his lowly station to a place of prominence as a slave. But then he was brought low again, handed over to die by Potiphar’s lying seductress of a wife. In prison, he rose again as perhaps the only man who could bring peace to a Pharaoh tormented by dreams.\nThis roller coaster of a life would have broken most. Why didn’t it break Joseph? Because the Lord showed him kindness. The circumstances beyond his control did not dictate Joseph’s standing where it counted. The Lord was with him.\nWhen I think about my friend Joe fading under the power of cancer, there was still light in him that was never extinguished. The Lord was with him. The Lord showed him kindness.\nHow does any of this apply to us? When our faith is in Christ, the truest thing we can say about our proximity to God in any and every circumstance is that the Lord is with us. He shows us His kindness. How? He gives us His Holy Spirit. In the prison cells and chemo chairs and in the courts of false accusation, this is true: the Lord is with His people—sustaining us unto eternal life, come what may in this one.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

Don’t hold that against me.\nSoap operas are TV shows that are often built around family drama and dynastic conquests. The most popular long-running shows manage to build decades-long story arcs around these families, with affairs and murders and business deals driving the storyline day-to-day, week-to-week, and even year after year. To be honest, if you had shared with me some of the stories we’ve encountered here in the book of Genesis without telling me their origin, I’d be inclined to believe they were part of some television soap opera’s extended universe. But no—these stories are found right here in the pages of Scripture.\nThat Scripture contains these raw and unfiltered dramas is beautiful; we’re exposed to the depths of human sin, and oftentimes, are given a glimpse into our own hearts as we watch others battle with the brokenness sin brings to God’s good creation. Just this week, we have encountered numerous stories of brokenness, but have also seen the goodness of God as He shows grace and mercy to sinners. Most importantly, we see that God’s purposes are not thwarted, even by our worst sins.\nIn today’s story, there is yet another twist of family tragedy. Jacob’s son, Er, is killed by God for his rampant wickedness. As was the custom, one of his brothers was required to marry his widow and have a child with her, to ensure that the deceased brother’s name was passed along. So Er’s brother, Onan, steps in, but his own wickedness leads to his death as well. Judah then bans Tamar from marrying another son, Shelah, because he is afraid of losing another son. By withholding his son from marrying Tamar, he deprived her of the protection she deserved, according to the law, and put his son’s own inheritance in jeopardy by not allowing Tamar to continue its passage to a son.\nIn the end, Judah realizes he is guilty, confessing that his sin is greater than Tamar’s (Genesis 38:26), because he denied her a husband. This is the beginning of his repentance.\nWe are all accountable for our sins. Our sins condemn us. We cannot hide from them, and we certainly cannot hide them from God. Instead of hiding our sins, we should turn to Christ, our Great High Priest and mediator, who stands ready to intercede for us. Our Father has promised to forgive us through Christ. And He has sent the Holy Spirit to seal us and empower us to live in light of this truth. May we not hide from Him, but boldly go before His throne in confession, that we may receive the grace and mercy offered to us.\nWritten by Brandon Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    My little brother and I have fought many battles. Because he’s eight years younger than me, most of the battles weren’t physical. Mostly, he annoyed me, and I yelled at him. I would purposely annihilate him in sports, video games, and in any other way that my older-brother intellect and physical prowess would allow. Of course, over time, he was able to grow and adjust to my overpowering, and it eventually made him stronger than me. Growing into his ability to beat me at the same video games he once lost was, in his own mind, one of his greatest accomplishments in life. And as his older brother, it pained me to lose to him—a reality he readily rubbed in every chance he got.\nJoseph reminds me of my little brother. As he rose to the relatively inconsequential ranks of video game victory, my jealousy and his pride brought consistent conflict into our relationship. After all, nobody likes to lose to their younger brother. However, for Joseph’s brothers, the stakes were much higher than childhood rivalries. It didn’t go over very well when Joseph informed them that, according to his dream, they would one day all bow down to him. While I can relate to why this angered his older brothers, it is clear that their reaction is prideful, selfish, and downright evil. Their disposition to destroy their brother rather than serve him would haunt them for years, as we will see as Genesis progresses.\nNo doubt, Joseph’s brothers responded sinfully. It would be easy for us to point the finger at them and think of how unimaginable it would be to sell our own siblings into slavery, regardless of how awful they could’ve been to us. Their actions were sinful, and God would deal with them. But we also need to look in the mirror at our inclination toward retaliation.\nWhether with siblings or spouses or neighbors or co-workers, all of us at times despise others, particularly when they win an argument, disrupt our comfort and control, or obtain something we want. Though we may keep most of our hatred beneath the surface, in our hearts we can be tempted to write them off. If left unchecked, the ones we’re supposed to love can become as good as dead in our eyes.\nWhen we look to Christ, we see that no one is expendable. Indeed, our sins condemn us and separate us from God. But He doesn’t send us into spiritual slavery; we choose slavery, and yet all the while, He pursues us. Joseph’s brothers sent him away against his will, but Jesus came to save us despite our own willful rejection of Him. May we respond to Him with gratitude and allow that gratitude to produce empathy in our hearts for those around us, even those whose sin can sometimes hurt us or make us uncomfortable.\nWritten by Brandon Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    As we have continued reading the story of Jacob this week, it’s been obvious that Jacob’s pursuit of God is wrought with family strife, political dealings, and at times, a blatant lack of concern for the safety and protection of the women in his midst. Indeed, this story begins with Jacob and Rachel’s daughter, Dinah, being raped. Dinah’s situation is much like her own mother’s—she’s the victim of a tangled web of sexual sin and power plays.\nIt is worth reminding ourselves again that Genesis is filled with theological truths and wisdom, as is all of Scripture; however, it’s also a historical narrative, so the events are a historical report of Jacob’s family. Nowhere do we see God approve of the obvious sin being committed by people; rather, we see God working within a messy situation, driving the story forward as He unfolds His ultimate plan of redemption in Christ.\nIn fact, the first time we see God speak in this section, He tells Jacob to build an altar, purify himself, and abandon false gods and idols. Jacob obeys God and settles in Bethel (“house of God”), where God changes his name to Israel (“God contends,” likely in relation to his earlier wrestling with God). Then, God reminds him that he is still heir to God’s promises by telling him to “be fruitful and multiply,” a command He gave to Adam, Noah, and Abraham (Genesis 35:11). God’s plan to fill the earth with God-worshipers wasn’t eradicated by sin in the garden, and it wouldn’t be eradicated by the sin in Jacob’s family.\nWe might be tempted to overlook Esau’s genealogy in Chapter 36 as a bit of historical minutiae or merely a transition to the next part of the story, but it’s actually a capstone to the saga between Jacob and his brother Esau. Though Esau was by birth the heir to the covenant God made with Abraham, Jacob was ultimately the heir to the promise. So when we see Esau settled in another land, the break between he and Jacob is obvious—Esau is blessed by God in many ways, but it is through Jacob that the ultimate covenantal promise would be fulfilled.\nGod’s chosen people would come through Israel and be established as His holy nation. Though God loves all people, He made particular covenants with particular people to create a missional center for His work in the world. This is no different for us in many ways—Jesus calls His Church to carry the gospel to the ends of the earth. Like Jacob before us, we acknowledge that God is with us wherever we go (Genesis 35:3). He loves us, protects us, and calls us to worship Him even in the midst of sinful chaos. May we respond to His call and lean on His covenant.\nWritten by Brandon Smith\n\n                ",

As he pursued Rachel as his wife, her father Laban tricked him by sending Leah to him instead. This instigated a decades-long game of chess, in which Laban continually took advantage of Jacob and used his own daughters as pawns.\nIt is worth noting that we are not being taught that having two wives is a commendable practice. Rather, we are given a glimpse of a real story from long ago that highlights the rampant wickedness that had come into the world back in Genesis 3. God never approves of the events in the story; rather, He shows mercy to a group of fallen people even in the midst of brokenness. In light of that, we should acknowledge with Jacob that God showed His boundless grace by protecting Jacob and providing for the women involved from the extent of Laban’s evil ways.\nAfter twenty years of service to Laban, Jacob is rightly concerned about cutting bait. He is clear that he wants to make a deal with Laban and move on with his life. However, when he leaves, he is faced with another complication: his brother Esau, who he tricked a few chapters before (Genesis 25), has the power and resources to destroy him and his family. Jaccob is afraid, so he cries out to God for help, acknowledging God’s goodness to him, and begging for that protection to continue. Much to Jacob’s surprise, God graces him with a brother who is warm and compassionate toward him. Once again, he takes note of how God has dealt with him, and he thanks Him.\nJacob’s story to this point is a repeated reminder of God’s mercy and grace. After sin entered the world in Genesis 3, God could have sent down bolts of lightning and destroyed everything. He could’ve flooded the earth and everyone on it, rather than sparing Noah and his family. And yet over and over again, He deals with His people kindly, meeting them where they are and dragging them out of the mire.\nOur Father in heaven always welcomes His prodigal children home and even leaves the porch to run out and meet them (Luke 15:11–32). Through Jesus, we see mercy and grace on ultimate display. In the sending of the Holy Spirit, we are adopted as children and Jesus is warm and compassionate toward us. Like Jacob, may we respond by saying, “I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant” (Genesis 32:10).\nWritten by Brandon Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    My wife and I dated for three (long) years before we married. Due to family and life circumstances, we had to wait about two years longer than we’d hoped to finally become husband and wife. We waited, sometimes patiently and sometimes impatiently, for the day we could finally enter into the covenant of marriage together. Even in our dating, we pursued God together and sought to be faithful to one another, but it wasn’t the same. When our wedding day finally arrived, we stood face-to-face and promised to love one another faithfully and unconditionally. By God’s grace, this is still true nearly eight years later. My deepest desire, though tainted by sin, is always to love her, care for her, protect her, and serve her.\nIn today’s reading, the relationships between man and wife include extenuating family circumstances, making my own story seem almost neat and tidy by comparison. In the ancient near eastern culture in which Jacob’s story takes place, we see the cultural background rather clearly. There were customs and stipulations related to marriage, and sometimes those rules come with unintended consequences and outright trickery. Laban quite clearly uses his own daughters as chess pieces to advance his own selfish desire to acquire wealth and free labor.\nIt’s doubtful anyone would confuse this story with a marriage manual. Jacob’s love triangle with Rachel and Leah (and the insertion of Zilpah and Bilhah) is messy indeed—certainly not a pattern any of us would endeavor to follow today. Interestingly, God’s only clear interactions in this story occur when He looks upon the situation with concern and pity for the women involved. Our God is a God of life and justice, and He is clearly moved to compassion by the barrenness of the women and the way they are used as pawns in Laban’s game.\nJacob’s love for Rachel is clear by the lengths he is willing to go in order to marry her, but it is also clearly far from perfect and not without complications. However, God’s love for those involved in this story shows us a glimpse of how much He loves each one of us—fully, completely, and without complication. By sending His Son to save us, the Father has proven that He will go to even greater lengths to reveal Himself to us. The cross reminds us that as His Church and His Bride, we should not be confused by His willingness to sacrifice Himself for us.\nBy the power of the Holy Spirit, we are joined to Christ and look forward to the day when we will gather around His table at the marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7–10). There, we will know fully the extent of the unbreakable covenant we have made with him, and that he has made with us. We will know without a doubt that we are not pawns in some supernatural game of chess, but that we are pursued, loved, and cared for by the Creator of the universe. May we rest in that promise today.\nWritten by Brandon Smith\n\n                ",

Contestants are given a basket of random food items and are expected to make a five-star dish using all of it. What in the world would you make with dried tarantulas, cherry cola sorbet, and marzipan fruit? Alpaca hot dogs, sauerkraut, and carrot ketchup? The baskets are disasters, but somehow, these professional chefs make something edible and, supposedly, somewhat delicious.\nWhen you read the story of Jacob, you are reading a Chopped basket in story form. Deceit, betrayal, abuse, and theft are what makes up so much of Jacob’s life. But God isn’t stumped by Jacob’s failures. He knows how to turn this basket of Jacob’s doings around.\nAfter stealing the blessing from Esau while wearing an Esau costume, of sorts, Jacob heads out to find a wife—to keep the promise of God afloat in this sin-torn world. Jacob nestles in for the night, and God gives him a vision: “A stairway was set on the ground with its top reaching the sky, and God’s angels were going up and down on it” (Genesis 28:12). As Jacob sees this stairway, God tells him, “I am the God of Abraham and Isaac, and I will be your God too. I will give you more heirs than there is dust on this planet. Every tribe and ethnicity will be blessed through you” (v.15). Consider that. Through him? The liar? The cheat? The guy who was just wearing an Esau costume to deceive his blind father? Yes, him. Why? This is how grace works.\nOur lives are Chopped baskets too. We are an amalgam of bad decisions, wrong turns, and failed cover-ups. But God loves to save sinners. Jesus was nailed to a cross for cheats. He rose from the dead for the kind of people that people love to hate. We are all massive failures apart from the grace of God in Christ the Lord. And just like He told Jacob, He tells us, “I am with you always. I will never leave you or turn my back on you, even till the final trumpet blares.” Jacob didn’t deserve this promise, and neither do we. That’s what makes grace, well, grace. Like Jacob, Jesus takes our pasts, our sins, our failures, and He gives us a glorious future with Him. Hallelujah, praise the Lord!\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

At this point in Genesis, the story is hitting a rough patch. God has delivered on His promises for offspring to Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah. As we meet the third generation of the promise to Abraham, it’s like we are entering the third full-round of Jenga; things are getting a little wobbly.\nAs heirs to the promise and the twin boys in Rebekah’s womb, Jacob and Esau are already at odds with one another, and Rebekah can sense it. As a model of wisdom, she goes to God for help. “And the LORD said to her: Two nations are in your womb; two peoples will come from you and be separated. One people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger” (Genesis 25:23). God tells her something that is both heart-breaking and heart-fortifying. Her sons will be at odds with each other, but this will not stop God’s promises; God will establish His holy people and keep His word, even though it will take the older brother serving the younger.\nIf the story of Abraham were solely in the hands of his family, the Bible might not have been nearly as long—maybe only be about half of Genesis. But the story is in God’s hands. Our stories are in God’s hands, too, so we must resist the urge to settle for the quick fixes in our own stories, like Esau did; he wanted a quick bite more than he wanted his long-lasting birthright.\nThe writer of Hebrews warns us to pursue holiness and to not treat the promises and provisions of God as if they’re something cheap, common, and easily consumable—something the equivalent of powdered donuts. We should treasure the promises of God and delight in the ways He is working in our lives.\nThe crucified and risen Lord Jesus bought this life for us; our lives are no longer our own, and as Scripture tells us, it is no longer you who live but Christ who lives in you (Galatians 2:20). If it were not for Christ, we would all go the way of Esau, trading down our joys and God’s best for us. As C.S. Lewis said, “We are far too easily pleased” with the things of this world. So protect your joy. Evaluate your loves. Count your many blessings, and remember what Christ has done for you.\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I’m sure you’ve heard the phrase, “The Lord works in mysterious ways.” Today’s reading highlights this reality. When William Cowper wrote the hymn, “God Moves in a Mysterious Way,” I doubt he was thinking about camels, a watering hole, engagements, and arranging a marriage. But it’s true. God often works in bizarre and beautiful ways.\nIsaac finding a wife isn’t just a neat story; it is crucial to God’s promise to Abraham. Grandkids are a part of the plan. For Abraham’s descendants to outnumber the sands, Isaac has to get married. For the Messiah to be born and redeem His wife, the Church, Isaac has to find a wife. Don’t forget to read these narratives with an eye on the meta-narrative of Genesis—of the whole Bible!—that a descendant of Abraham would be born to crush the serpent and save people from the sins and reign forever on the throne (Genesis 3:15). When you see the engagement of Isaac and Rebekah in light of the story of Christ and His Church, it all makes more sense.\nThe oddness of looking for a wife in watering camels is nothing compared to the faithful foolishness of looking for a Savior with water and blood shooting from His side as He hangs from a Roman cross. “A man who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the LORD” (Proverbs 18:22). A man who finds an empty tomb obtains salvation from the Lord, too.\nAbraham’s servant was looking for God’s kindness (Genesis 24:14). When he saw it in Rebekah, he knelt low and worshiped God. Does God’s kindness lead you to humbly worship Him? When is the last time God’s provision, God looking out for you, God displaying His care for you led you to kneel low? Maybe we need to recover the physical demonstration of our spiritual affections. Perhaps more than a quick prayer of, “Thanks, God,” is in order. The Lord of all deservers more than a spiritual fist bump. Get low. Let’s humble ourselves before the Holy God, whose kindness is poured out on us in mysterious, marvelous, matchless ways.\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

Maybe you gave up a seat on the bus, or perhaps you let your kid have the center cinnamon roll. But let’s get real—these are very small things. And yet, we struggle to make these sacrifices. How many times have you lobbied for your Spotify playlist? Driver’s choice, sorry everybody! These aren’t sacrifices, though. Maybe inconveniences. Maybe a temporary foregoing of our preferences. But what Abraham went through on the mountain with Isaac is a supernatural dynamic of faith.\nImagine being Abraham. Desert beard and all. First, the God you’ve just come to know told you to let goods and kindred go and to follow Him to a new land (Genesis 12:1). You did it. Imperfectly, but still, you did it. God then promises you a baby boy, and your wife laughs herself onto the floor (18:12–15). Soon after, a baby’s cry fills your tent. You watch your son learn to walk, speak, and turn into a young man—and then God tells you to put your son on the altar. Your beloved son, the gift from this God you’ve come to know and follow.\nSomehow, you do it. You trust God.\nYou tell your boy that, together, you must head up the mountain to worship God. You tighten the wood on his back. You try to hide the tears crowding the corners of your eyes. You can’t bear hearing your son ask about the sacrifice. “God will provide,” you tell him (22:8)—and you keep telling yourself He will too.\nYour grip on the knife makes your pulse skyrocket, your hands sweat, and your stomach sour. Your lungs can’t get enough air as you close your eyes, unable to look at the son whom you love, raise the blade, and then hear the voice of God calling out to you and telling you to Stop!\nGod points out a ram to take the boy’s place. You untie your boy, embrace him, haul the ram over, and worship the Lord your God because He provided a substitutionary sacrifice of His own (v.14).\nAbraham believed God. He believed that God would raise Isaac from the dead because Abraham held onto God’s promise that his descendants would outnumber the stars in the sky (Hebrews 11:9). Isaac had to live. And God provided another way.\nDo you see how God has provided for you? His Son, Jesus of Nazareth, died in your place for your sins. Do you see how the risen Christ loves and leads you today? What about the Holy Spirit helping you kill sin and grow in holiness? Your church community? The Bible you read today? Brothers, remember that Abraham didn’t rename the place, “The Lord might provide” but “the Lord will provide” (v.14, emphasis mine). He did provide, and He will again. Just keep your eye on the clouds. He’s coming soon.\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

Delayed flights, lost bags, fine print shenanigans—they make promises, declarations, expectations, and fail to follow through. Doctors too. They don’t lose your bags, but they make you wait and wait past your agreed-upon appointment time. Restaurants lie too. Sure, the server at the swanky Mexican-Polynesian fusion restaurant said the food would be right out—“in a couple of minutes,” he assures you. Twenty minutes later the frustration of still not having your meal is multiplied by your cranky kids, which basically equals a disaster. So many people make promises and fumble the ball when it’s crunch time. We all do.\nGod always keeps His word. Airlines are subject to weather and human error. Doctors have to work at the speed of their patients’ sickness. Servers are at the mercy of the kitchen. Everyone’s word exists under the influence of outside factors—everyone except God’s. The Father’s word is not no subject to weather, economics, human health, or anything at all under creation.\nGod promised Sarah and Abraham that they would have a son, and a year later, it happens. Isaac is born. It doesn’t matter that Sarah and Abraham are way beyond child-bearing years; God keeps His promise. Even though Abraham’s body, according to the writer of Hebrews, was as good as dead (Hebrews 11:12)—God remained faithful to His word.\nNothing can override the promises of God. Whether a promise made to Sarah in the open-air wilderness, or a promise made to you as you read Scripture and sip coffee in an air-conditioned cafe, know that God will keep the promises written in His Word. The Bible is full of God’s promises to His people, proclamations of trust that can never be delayed or undone.\nDo you remember what the apostle Paul says about all of the promises of God? “For every one of God’s promises is ‘Yes’ in him. Therefore, through him we also say ‘Amen’ to the glory of God” (2 Corinthians 1:20). Every promise is a Christo-centric, “Yes!” Jesus is the answer.\nWhen God promises that whoever calls on the name of the Lord Jesus will be saved (Romans 10:9–10), He means it. When Jesus said to come to Him to find rest for your weary soul (Matthew 11:28–30), He delivers. When Jesus said He would die for the sins of humanity, rise again from the dead, and welcome sinners like us into His kingdom, God always keeps His Word.\nWhat He does not promise is to meet our expectations—don’t get that twisted—but then again, His ways and thoughts are so much better than what we could ever ask of Him or imagine possible. But He does keep the promises He has made to us. From Isaac to Immanuel, and forgiveness to freedom from sin, Yahweh gives His “Yes!” in Yeshua.\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

Every time I read it, it makes me uncomfortable… which is probably the point. The way the Bible describes the sinfulness of the people in Sodom and Gomorrah should terrify us. Human sin and pride is ugly.\nThat ugliness is on full display here, but so is God’s simple response to it: “They were haughty and did detestable acts before me, so I removed them when I saw this” (Ezekiel 16:50). He would completely destroy them, raining burning sulfur, demolishing “the entire plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and whatever grew on the ground” (Genesis 19:24–25).\nIf we ever wondered how God feels about sin, all we need to do is look to this event.\nBut here’s what makes this more uncomfortable for me: the Bible takes this example and takes it to another level. In fact, it seems that the ugliness of Sodom and Gomorrah’s sin is merely a snapshot of what is going on in the heart of every human being. Every single one of us is just as prone to sinful actions. All of us “suppress the truth” in our hearts and by our unrighteousness (Romans 1:18). All of us have failed to glorify God and show Him gratitude. All of us have “exchanged the truth of God for a lie,” and so we are all without excuse before Him (vv.21,25).\nHopeless. Helpless. Doomed.\nBut what we shouldn’t miss in all of this is the compassion of God. God hates sin. He hates pride. But even in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah, He said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake” (Genesis 18:26). Just as the awfulness of Sodom and Gomorrah’s evil is a snapshot of a larger reality, so, too, is this snapshot of God’s mercy—and in the gospel we see this mercy on full display. In Sodom, there were none that were righteous, not even one. In the entire world, there are none who are righteous, not even one (Romans 3:10). But Jesus came to make the unrighteous righteous by crediting His perfect righteousness to anyone who trusts in Him.\nSo despite the darkness, this passage, like so many others in the life of Abraham, should give us hope. God hates sin, and He does not ignore it. He will judge it all, including the evil that we see in the world right now. But for the sake of those He has declared righteous, He is waiting, so that as many as possible might turn from their sin and put their trust in Him.\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong\n\n                ",

But no matter which you choose, I think one that should be among them comes in Genesis 18, when Abraham received three visitors who once again swore that he and Sarah would have a child. Hearing this, “she laughed to herself: ‘After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I have delight?’” (v.12).\nWhenever I read this, there is so much anguish that comes through. She’s too old, too “worn out” to have a child. Pure, perfect hopelessness (if it isn’t contradictory to say). But what is at the root of this hopelessness? She wanted a child, wanted this promise to be true. But Sarah was a realist. She looked at the situation from her perspective. She was almost 100 years old; far too old to have a child. She and Abraham had missed out. It was too late. So, the realist became the hopeless.\nAnd if God’s promises depended on ordinary means, she would have been right.\nBut God said to her, and to us, “Is anything impossible for the LORD?” (Genesis 18:14). Could the one who made everything, who spoke all of creation into existence with a word, really be incapable of allowing a child to be born to parents “too old” to have children? Could the all-powerful God of the universe really be unable to do the impossible?\nAre we like Sarah in this regard? How often do we assume God is incapable of doing what He says He will do—not what we think He should do, but what He actually says in Scripture—and become hopeless when we don’t see it happening? How often do we take God’s promises and turn them into commands for ourselves, so that we put ourselves under the constraints of the Law with its old way of thinking instead of pursuing freedom in Christ? If it’s true that “for freedom, Christ set us free,” why do we submit to “a yoke of slavery”? (Galatians 5:1).\nBecause we’ve been taught that what seems too good to be true usually is. We’ve been trained from birth to be realists, to be hopeless. Somewhere in the depths of our hearts, we don’t really believe that all things are possible for God, so we go a step further and assume nothing is possible for God. But God wants us to see that the opposite is true. Nothing is impossible for Him. All things are possible for Him and with Him. And if we had any doubt, all we need to do is look a year down the road in Abraham and Sarah’s story, to the birth of Isaac, where Sarah laughs once more, but with joy instead of despair (Genesis 21:1–6), and her realism is replaced with rejoicing.\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong\n\n                ",

I’m not talking about having appropriate self-confidence, I am talking about encouraging each other to live as though everything depends on us. That seems pretty foolhardy, if not downright prideful, doesn’t it?\nThe more I dig into the major themes of Scripture, and how God began to reveal His plan to rescue and redeem the world, the more I see that come through, especially in the life of Abram. Many of us know the famous line in response to God once again promising that Abram would have a son, “Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness” (Genesis 15:6). And many of us also know what happened after: Abram believed God would keep His promise and give him an heir, but he also faltered, forgetting what God had told him earlier, words that were foundational to his faith:\n“Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield; your reward will be very great” (vv.1–2).\nBut Abram was afraid. His wife Sarai was afraid too. And out of their fear, they acted arrogantly. They acted as though God’s plan depended on them and on their actions, and so they did what was right in their own eyes, and it led to disaster—as it always does.\nThis is why I fear encouraging anyone to believe in themselves. When we put our trust in our own abilities, we wind up creating a giant mess. This is so much of what Paul wanted to get across to the Galatian and Roman churches, and to us as well. We cannot forget that our standing before God doesn’t come from our attempts to make it happen; we can’t earn our way into redemption (Romans 4:1–5). Redemption is built upon faith in Jesus as the One who God’s covenant pointed to: the seed of Abraham, the Son through whom Abraham would have may descendents. And by faith, we are brought into Abraham’s family “according to the promise” (Galatians 3:27).\nAll of it comes from one place and one place alone: faith in the one who said to Abram, “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield; your reward will be very great” (Genesis 15:1–2). Basically, God said, “Believe me. Trust me. I will do what I said I will do.” Like Abram, we are all tempted to doubt this. But if the gospel is true, we don’t need to be afraid. We don’t need to take our salvation into our own hands. We need to believe, to trust that God is our shield, and live out of that trust. And when we do, the reward is great indeed.\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong\n\n                ",

Actually, I get weirded out whenever I see this happen with any person in Scripture. Not because he, or any of those we call “heroes” of the faith (Hebrews 11), lacks virtuous qualities, but because I believe the Bible wants us to remember that the heroes of the faith were, more or less, goobers like the rest of us.\nAbram, to me, has always been the perfect example of this. When God made His promise to bless him and make a great nation from his descendents (Genesis 12:2), it wasn’t because Abram was perfect. In fact, no reason is given for why Abram—not someone else, say, his neighbor—is chosen by God. If anything, we’re left with questions about his chosenness, because what did Abram do almost immediately after receiving God’s promise? He lied about his wife, Sarai, claiming she was his sister, and gave her to Pharaoh in exchange for safety in Egypt (vv.10–20), a mistake he repeated several years later with King Abimelech (Genesis 20:2).\nBut what always gets me is how, despite all this, Melchizedek, the mysterious priest Abram met on the way to rescue Lot, could say, “Abram is blessed by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth” (Genesis 14:19). He wasn’t blessed because of his character or integrity. He wasn’t blessed because he deserved it. He was blessed because God Most High chose to bless him. Abram was a goober, but God blessed him because He wanted to bless him.\nI need to remember this because it is true for me also. I am not blessed by God because I am better or more faithful or whatever we’re all tempted to think about ourselves (or others, for that matter) at times. I am blessed because God has chosen to bless me. And I know that I do not have to worry about Him changing His mind because the blessing He has given me has been guaranteed by another priest, a greater priest who was like Melchizedek (Hebrews 7:15–22): Jesus, the one who guaranteed His blessing to us by faith in His death and resurrection.\nYes, God blesses goobers like Abram. He blesses goobers like you and me too.\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong\n\n                ",

Most stories track with themes like hope, love, and sacrifice—you can see them in everything from Star Wars to Harry Potter to and everything in between). They run throughout the Bible, too, though they aren’t the only themes. One I always see exploding off the pages of Genesis is the danger of pride, specifically in God’s response to it.\nThink about the incident in Babel, for instance. All of humanity united as one, all able to speak the same language and understand one another perfectly—it’s the stuff that utopian fantasies (and Star Trek) are made of. However, what united them was their arrogance and rebellion against God (Genesis 11:4–5). In response, God changed their languages and scattered them, which resulted in them breaking apart into many people groups, no longer able to be united in their false worship. This theme is picked up again in the Book of Psalms:\n“Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? \nThe kings of the earth take their stand, \nand the rulers conspire together against \nthe LORD and his Anointed One” (Psalm 2:1–2).\nAnd when Mary sang her Magnificat (Luke 1:51), she praised God for how He “scattered the proud because of the thoughts of their hearts,” which is something we tend to gloss over around Christmastime when we read this passage.\nBut like so many other examples of good storytelling, the themes in Scripture don’t standalone. Yes, God despises pride, but His judgment of it is accompanied by something else—a promise, one of blessing and hope. This is powerfully reflected in God’s words to Abram in Genesis 12: “I will make you into a great nation, I will bless you, I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.” What’s so incredible about this promise, though, is that it wasn’t made to just one man, but to a man who becomes a family, which became a great nation, which then became a family of people from all nations blessing the whole world.\nHow?\nBy faith in one Man, Jesus Christ, who lived and died and now lives again for us. He took God’s judgment of our pride upon Himself, and in exchange, blessed us with His perfection its place. Jesus undoes the curse of Babel, and brings people from all nations and all languages and all backgrounds together as one, united not in their pride, but in worship of God.\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong\n\n                ",

Here in Genesis 9, God speaks them to Noah and his sons, but He issued the same commands to Adam and Eve in Genesis 1:28. Now that the waters of the great flood have receded, life is going to start again. It’s a new beginning. A new creation, so to speak. And so, God gives the new first family their marching orders, just the same as before.\nWhat follows in this passage is nothing short of heartbreaking. Noah tends a garden, as Adam did before him, but this garden is a vineyard, and Noah gets drunk on the wine it produces. Then, one of Noah’s sons does something so horrific, we’re not entirely sure what it is. The Bible simply tells us Ham “saw his father naked” (Genesis 9:22).\nIt may be that Ham wanted to multiply the shame of his father, since he went and “told his two brothers.” Or it could be that “saw his father naked” is a euphemism for an indecent sexual act committed by Ham against his father. One more possibility is that Noah’s “nakedness” is a reference to Noah’s wife (who is unnamed in the text). There’s biblical evidence for this sort of language. A more literal reading of Leviticus 18:7 uses a husband’s “nakedness” to refer to his wife’s exposed body, rather than his own. She belongs to him, just as he belongs to her (see Genesis 2:23). In this scenario, Ham committed an indecent sexual act with his own mother while Noah was inebriated and unable to stop him. He would have done this in order to usurp his father as leader of the family. But regardless of which understanding is correct, the headline is the same: humanity had been given a fresh start, only to squander it in sin.\nWhat I find amazing when I read this passage is not the depths of human depravity. (I live my own brand each and every day.) Rather, it’s that God knew this would happen. He knew it before the rain stopped falling from the sky and the ark came to rest in Ararat. He knew it before He told Noah to build a boat in the first place. He knew it before Adam and Even had first invited sin into the world. He even knew it before time began. Yet, God carved a path of salvation for humanity all the same—for Adam and Eve, Noah and Ham, and all of us who are like them in more ways than we’d like to remember.\nIn his memoir All Is Grace, the late Brennan Manning wrote, “God loves you unconditionally, as you are and not as you should be, because nobody is as they should be.” If we really believed God loved us like this—the way He has shown us countless times in Scripture and in our lives—the world would be a much different place, don’t you think? We might actually start to behave as we “should be” in response to God’s love, rather than as a misguided mechanism to earn it. We might all become a lot more like Jesus. And so, as we read this dark passage about grotesque sin being committed in the shadow of the world’s first second chance, the question before all of us is this: Do you believe God loves you? How you answer makes all the difference in the world.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Just out of college, I shared an apartment with three good friends. The apartment itself was the first floor of an old, run-down, probably-not-up-to-code house, and it was small—so small that I had to store most of my worldly possessions three hours away. Books, photos, furniture, and a few sacred odds and ends from my twenty-odd years of life were squirrelled away in boxes in the basement of my sister’s house.\nThen, one day I got a phone call from my sister. She was in a bit of a panic. Her area had been the target of heavy rains for the previous few days and that morning she had awoken to a small lake in her basement. Everything that wasn’t up off the floor had been soaked, which meant that most of my belongings were forever ruined. That weekend, I made the trek to her house to survey the damage, and what I could salvage fit neatly on the floorboard of the passenger’s seat in my car with room to spare.\nWater is amazing. It gives new life and washes clean. But it also has the power to destroy whatever lies in its path. In the sixth chapter of Genesis, God used a flood to wash the earth clean. It was the end of the world—or it would have been had God not rescued Noah and his family.\nWhy Noah? The Bible says that “Noah walked with God” (Genesis 6:9). He was righteous, though that doesn’t mean he was unbroken and without sin. It means that he trusted God and lived his life in a way that reflected God’s good heart. At the time, this was a fairly unique trait for a human being. Wickedness had overtaken the earth, and “every inclination of the human mind was nothing but evil all the time” (v.5). So God decreed a fresh start for His world, and the rains came in obedience to His command.\nWhen we open our Bibles and begin reading from the beginning, we only get a few pages in before we have to wrap our minds around the judgment of God. And wrap our minds we must. What does it say about our Creator that He could wipe out so many? What does it say about humanity that we could sow such evil? The flood is a stark reminder that things are not as they should be. Every moment of every day, God could destroy the world, and it would be perfectly just for Him to do so. He is our Maker, and humanity is (still) living in outright rebellion.\nEven after the waters receded, God’s evaluation of the human race was pretty bleak: “the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth onward” (Genesis 8:21). This evaluation still stands. It’s never been rescinded, and the wages of sin is still death (Romans 6:23), remember?\nThe flood narrative is there to show us how things could be. It’s there as a reminder of what we would face apart from God’s grace. You and I have been given the Noah treatment. We’ve been saved from the flood so that, by the grace of God that is ours in Jesus Christ, we might, like Noah, walk with God.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I have three small boys, and because my wife, Laurin, and I believe in the power of books, we do lots and lots of reading at our house. And because only one of our boys is reading on his own, it’s storytime in our living room several times a day and every night before bedtime.\nThe thing about reading to three boys, age five and under, is that they don’t really want anything new. They ask to hear the same stories rehearsed again and again, with the same pace, same inflection, and same silly voices. They don’t want to mix things up, not in the slightest. In fact, whenever we get a new book from the library, it usually takes some solid convincing that it’s worth their time. So, to say they know their favorite books by heart would be an understatement.\nThe most familiar stories in the Bible can be like that. We’ve read them, read about them, and heard them preached so many times, it can seem there’s nothing new to discover. But that’s only how it seems. I can’t count the number of times I’ve read the story of Cain and Abel, but not too long ago, I found myself staring at the page in front of me, reading and rereading a familiar passage: “Then the LORD said to Cain, ‘Why are you furious? And why do you look despondent? If you do what is right, won’t you be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it’” (Genesis 4:6–7).\nGod knows Cain is plotting to murder his brother, but His response is neither outright condemnation of Cain nor a defense of Abel. Instead, the Lord’s concern is for Cain’s heart. He wants the son of the man He formed out of dirt to rise above the sin lurking within him. God lays it out plain for Cain, saying, in essence, “Sin is out to get you, but you must overpower it!”\nWhen I read what God had to say to Cain in this moment, I’m struck by a few truths. The first is that sin is complicated. God actually personified sin, comparing it to a predator that stalks its prey. Sin is a force, an enemy lying in wait. It’s not neutral, and it’s all around us in this cursed world. We must be on our guard, and as God instructed Cain, we must master it. The second thing I take away from this passage is that the reality of sin does not let us off the hook. Cain was still responsible for his actions, and so are we.\nLastly, I see in God’s concern for Cain an example for us all. You see, every sin has at least two victims—the person sinned against and the sinner. Every sin we commit robs us of our true humanity. We were created to reflect God’s image, and when we break God’s laws and act in ways contrary to His heart, we lose something. Every. Single. Time. That truth ought to be enough to stop us in our tracks when we are tempted, and it ought to fill us with compassion for those who are overcome by the sin crouched at their doors.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

We know that Adam had to work a lot harder to provide food for his family (Genesis 3:17–18). We know that Eve experienced pain in childbirth, and her relationship with Adam was strained (v.16). We know that one son was murdered (4:8), while another son—the murderer—became a wanderer on the earth (v.12). In a very real sense, Adam and Eve lost two sons in one day. But beyond those details, the Bible doesn’t tell us what daily life was like for Adam and Eve.\nWe’re told Adam lived to the ripe old age of 930 (Genesis 5:5), and based on his age when his son Seth was born (v.3), which was some years after Eden became off-limits, we can deduce that Adam had more than eight hundred years to think and remember and regret the events of Genesis 3. I realize God had said the punishment for eating fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil would be death (2:17), but somehow a centuries-long life of regret seems almost worse. Imagine feeling personally responsible for every broken thing in the world. Imagine rehearsing and replaying that moment of dread: “So the LORD God called out to the man and said to him, ‘Where are you?’” (3:9). Imagine knowing, in a very real and tangible sense, that every heartache, every loss, and every tear in the world could have been avoided if only you would have trusted God. If only.\nThere was nothing Adam or Eve could do. What’s done is done, so to speak. But that doesn’t mean the world’s first couple was without hope. God could fix what they had broken. There had been a hint that God might do something about the curse of sin and death. He had promised a child would come to crush the serpent’s head (Genesis 3:15). He had also provided skins to cover the nakedness Adam and Eve felt that day. Skins, of course, point to a sacrifice. Though the Bible doesn’t tell us what sort of skins they were, it seems a death was required to cover their shame.\nLife for Adam and Eve after the fall took a lot of faith. They had glimpses of what God could do but didn’t quite know how or when He would bring relief to the world. But one thing was certain: they were powerless to fix their own plight. They needed to trust their Creator—the very thing they failed to do in the garden. Though our lives look very different, our situation is the same. We can do nothing in our own strength to remedy the curse of sin and death. Though we can see clearly with hindsight that the promised child was Jesus of Nazareth and the sacrifice we really needed was His death on the cross, we, like Adam and Eve before us, are still wholly dependent on our Maker.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

I know that’s not a popular opinion, what with the post-Christmas malaise, the cold weather, and short days. But in my mind, January is like an open field after a freshly fallen snow without a single boot print. It’s a fresh start, a new beginning. The possibilities seem endless. Or at least that’s the way it seems to me as December’s short days draw to a frosty close.\nSomewhere around noon on New Year’s Day, however, the illusion of a new beginning begins to crack. The problems I had in the previous year have somehow followed me into my fresh start. The world remains just as broken as it was before the ball dropped in Times Square. Except for the arbitrary page on the calendar, nothing has changed. Not really anyway. So, when my initial disappointment with the new year wears off, I’m left feeling homesick for a place I’ve never been, a place the Bible calls Eden.\nOver the centuries, the early chapters of Genesis have caused much debate in academic circles and church small groups alike. How old is the earth? What are we to make of the six “days” of creation? What was life like before the fall of humanity? What does it mean for people to have been made in the image of God? But what I’m most interested in as I read the beginning of our family history in Genesis 1–2 is the beauty of life in God’s presence.\nThe Bible tells us that our destiny in Christ is a return to life in God’s presence. It was what we were meant for, what we were created to know and experience. In fact, everything we read between the opening chapters of Genesis and the closing chapters of Revelation describes life under the curse of sin and death. It’s all a big interruption in the goodness, beauty, and truth God gave us when He created this universe. We are living in the parentheses—that part of the story that deviates from the Author’s original intent. In the span of eternity, it will seem but a blink of an eye.\nWe were made for Eden, but that’s not to say we were made to laze around paradise, eating grapes and sunning ourselves, while monkey butlers massage our feet. We were given a mission: “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and subdue it.” In other words, God commissioned Adam and Eve to extend the borders of Eden to the rest of the world, to make the whole earth a place where God could dwell with humanity.\nIf you keep on reading in Genesis, and then press on into Exodus and Leviticus, and still further into the Old Testament Historical Books, Psalms, and the Wisdom Literature, into the Minor Prophets, not stopping when you hit the New Testament but continuing through all four Gospels, Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation, you’ll find that God never rescinds this command. That is why Jesus prayed, “Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10). One day, this prayer will be fully and completely answered, but in the meantime, God has called us to make small steps toward this certain future. These early chapters of Genesis, then, are not the outlier in the grand story of redemption; they are our marching orders.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

We rarely understand their implications or the demand they put on us. “I will always be here for you.” “I will never forget you.” Well, until I’m not or until I do. People too often fail to live up to the demands of these words.\nNot so with God. When He says “always,” it means always, and when He says “never,” it means never. The last chapters of Joshua exemplify this clearly for us.\nJoshua has reached his end. He is “old and advanced in years” (Joshua 23:10). He is on death’s doorstep and he cares about what will happen to the people when he is gone. So he calls Israel together and addresses them. He reminds them that God has always been faithful, always kept His promises. Joshua reminds them that God will always keep His covenant and never forsake them if they remain faithful to His Word. Joshua recounts how they never won a battle without God and always needed Him. \nThe people responded, as you would expect, with a promise they could not keep. They would always be obedient to God, always be faithful, and never abandon His ways for the false gods around them. But we know this was not the case. People’s promises die faster than the bodies that utter them. Time, mortality, and sinful human nature rendered Israel’s promise moot. \nThe people fell away after the fall of their leader. Israel had taken on a burden they could not bear—the burden of perpetual obedience in their own strength, the burden to follow God’s law in lockstep. Joshua’s leadership, no matter how great, was not enough to show them how to do this. Something more was needed, and that is the very point of this book (and the entire Old Testament). It all points forward to the One Man for whom always and never are not too great a burden.\nJesus said His yoke was easy and His burden was light, not like the Old Testament law. He did not do away with the law, but rather fulfilled its demands: perfect obedience, flawless sacrifice, and honoring God in every way. Jesus did what Joshua could not. He provided the way—He was the way—to permanent rest in a perfect Promised Land.\nWhen we read of leaders like Joshua, we should see faint, distorted reflections of Jesus. Joshua points forward to the One who will always keep His promises, will never forsake His people, and will one day bring us home to the eternal Promised Land. \nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    We are called to love our neighbors as we love ourselves. But it can be hard to live in solidarity with others, even with people we know we are tied to.\nAfter the dust had cleared from all the fighting, Joshua told the tribes to go settle the lands allotted to them. On their way home, the tribes who settled east of the Jordan built a monument near the river so massive that it almost started a civil war. It was a simple misunderstanding, really. But after all we’ve seen in this book so far, it is not hard to imagine that everyone would have been on edge.\nHere’s what happened. The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the eastern half of Manasseh comprised the Israelites who settled on the east side of the Jordan. Everyone else settled on the west. If you’ve ever lived in a place divided by a river, perhaps it has been your experience that the neighborhoods on the other side seem further away than those on your side that are the same distance away.\nThat sense of being cut off would have been doubled for the Israelites who did not have the convenience of bridges. Reuben, Gad, and the eastern half of Manasseh didn’t want to feel cut off from the rest of their people. They didn’t want to be forgotten. And they, themselves, didn’t want to forget the rest of their countrymen to the west. So they built a large monument by the Jordan River—big enough for tribes on both sides to see from a great distance.\nThe tribes west of the Jordan mistook the imposing monument as a possible sign of aggression from the eastern tribes—as a boundary they should think twice about crossing. When the western tribes confronted the eastern tribes about this, they learned that the altar was not built as a symbol of division, but as a gesture of solidarity with their countrymen in Canaan.\nIt is easy to misread the intentions of others. Imagine the conversations the western tribes had about the monument the eastern tribes built, as suspicions arose and as they wondered if they were going to have to engage in a civil war after all they had just been through together.\nJoshua’s instruction to the people in Joshua 22:5 is the same command God has always given His people: love the Lord with everything we have and everything we are. From this flows the command to love our neighbors as we love ourselves. Sometimes loving our neighbors well means risking difficult conversations in the hope of finding peace and clearing up confusion or conflict.\nWe all do things that can be misconstrued by others as being malicious. And every one of us has, at some point, misunderstood the actions of others—sometimes assuming the worst, only to find out later that our assumptions were way off.\nThe second greatest command, Jesus tells us, is to love our neighbor as we love ourselves (Matthew 22:39). What situation in your life warrants an awkward conversation? What would it take to risk that conversation in the name of peace and love? What will it cost not to?\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In recent years, there has been no small debate in the media over what have been called “sanctuary cities”—that is, those cities scattered throughout the United States in which illegal immigrants have been allowed to live without fear of extradition. Whatever we may think of this concept in our current political climate, the reality of such “sanctuary cities” carries echoes of the “cities of refuge” mentioned in Joshua 20.\nAfter Joshua led Israel to take possession of their promised inheritance—having given God’s people physical rest from their warfare—the Lord told Joshua to appoint cities of refuge which would serve as safe-havens for anyone who unintentionally took a life (Joshua 20:1-6).\nIt is not immediately clear what to make of these “safe-havens” for the accused. However, it begins to make sense as we put together several details unfolded in the passage. What it says is this: an individual who has been accused of murder—and who is either merely accused or guilty of unintentional bloodshed—can flee to a city of refuge. The elders of the city shall then protect the accused party from the wrath of the avenger of blood (usually a relative of the one who has been murdered). The guilty party needs to then remain in the city until the death of the High Priest, after which he can return to his home in peace and safety. \nThe hinge on which this entire passage turns is that the death of the High Priest is regarded, in some sense, as an atonement for the blood that was shed. The accused party is set free by the death of the High Priest. \nSinclair Ferguson sums up the gospel significance of this so well when he says, “Jesus, who has the same name as Joshua, provides us with a city of refuge in which we can hide from the consequences of the guilt of our past actions, and not only a city in which we can hide but an open door into liberty and life because He is the High Priest—the High Priest beyond all other High Priests, who has died in order to deal with our sins.”\nGod not only gave Israel a partial rest in the promised land, a type of the eternal rest to come for believers. He also gave them this law to remind them that guilty sinners need rest from the guilt of their sin. Just like those who fled to the city of refuge for that rest, so now we flee to Jesus to find rest from the guilt, condemnation, and judgment of our sin. \nWe flee to Christ and we are safe. \nWritten By Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

We can all create great stories about how we deserve the privilege of being first. \nFirst is attractive because you know there will be enough. There is no danger of getting left out when you’re at the front of the line. First means you will get your piece of the cake. \nBut we all know that to insist on being first is selfish and glares of pride. I often think I would rather be next. Not first, but next—perpetually next. That way I won’t look as arrogant, and I can look over the shoulder of the person in first place and still know there is enough for me. Being next appears less selfish and I know I’ll still get my piece cake.\nJoshua was neither first nor next. He was actually beyond last. Joshua 19:49 reads, “When they had finished distributing the land into its territories, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them.” The land had been given; the cake had been handed out. Joshua missed the joy of being first and even the expectation in being next.\nLand was the economy of life in that time; no land equaled no life. But maybe Joshua had the audacity to hope for a different land, a different life. Maybe he understood the joy and sacrifice of being the parent at the birthday party—the one whose job is to serve cake to dirty-faced kids who each would love to be first, and who have great sales pitches for why first place suits them best.\nWe’re told the land for the tribes was divided by lot (Joshua 14:2), which was a common way to keep the ‘sales pitches’ in check and acknowledge God’s place in distributing the land. Joshua’s inheritance, however, was given by the people. As the leader, Joshua modeled selfless living before the tribes, and they saw the example he set. They saw how Joshua served God and how they benefited from his faithfulness. So the elders honored his leadership and sacrifice by giving him an inheritance of his own. In God’s economy, there was still plenty left for Joshua.\nLike a parent who serves his children before himself, Joshua was a leader who waited. In his waiting, Joshua trusted the God who sustained him. Joshua knew the greater inheritance was not in the land or in the praise of the people he led. His inheritance was that the God of all creation knew his name.\nThe patience of waiting is a grace to be learned. As followers of Christ, we hope for a greater inheritance than we will experience in this land. That hope is evident in our contentment to be beyond last, knowing that the God of creation knows our names too. As heirs with Jesus, we will not be left out.\nWritten By Jason Tippetts\n\n                ",

One of the things that took some getting used to was how old everything there was. It was common to visit places that had been around for thousands of years. I remember one day going to a crusader castle that was built only 1,000 years ago, and thinking it looked so new compared to everything else. But most of these old places had one thing in common: they were ruins.\nHow strong does something need to be, and how long does it need to last for you to regard it as permanent?\nJoshua 17 and 18 mark the halfway point of the account of the distribution of land to the twelve tribes of Israel. And in Joshua 18:1, something very important happens: the people set up the Tabernacle at Shiloh. Before there was a kingdom of Israel, before David took Jerusalem, before Solomon’s temple was built on Mount Zion, there was Shiloh—situated roughly 24 miles north of Jerusalem, near the geographic center of the promised land.\nAfter centuries of slavery and decades of wilderness wandering, the people of Israel must have felt the surge of a sense of permanence when they first set up the tabernacle. They were home at last. And that home must have seemed permanent too. Shiloh stood throughout the time of the judges, on into the days of the prophet Samuel, who grew up there under the care of Eli the priest (1 Samuel 1:1-25). Shiloh would house the Ark of the Covenant, where the presence of the Lord dwelt, for over three hundred years (c. 1444-1116 B.C.). For perspective, the Tabernacle stood in Shiloh for almost 100 years longer than the United States of America has existed.\nFor Joshua’s generation, and many to follow, Shiloh was the destination of countless pilgrims who esteemed the city as the spiritual center of things—God’s own town.\nBut now it is a ruin.\nThe city fell to the Philistines over 3,000 years ago. Knowledge of the actual site of the tabernacle is lost to history. Only rubble remains where the center of things once stood.\nThe people of Israel’s true and better inheritance was not a place made of wood and stone. Neither was God’s eternal presence meant to be contained in a box of gold. Even as we read about the long awaited distribution of land to the twelve tribes of Israel, we remember that nothing of what they built remains.\nBut the God who loved Israel and led them does remain. He will never become a ruin, and neither will those whose faith is in Him. \nThe grass withers and the flower fades, but the word of the Lord stands forever (Isaiah 40:8).\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

Sometimes you ask for a simple gift and you get something extraordinary and beyond what you asked for. Other times, you ask for a $25 gift card to your favorite bookstore and you receive a $25* (*on sale for $5) tie or scarf. Gift-giving is a mixed bag, but gift-giving (and receiving) is still a blessing.\nIn our passage today, we are in the throes of the Israelite war, as we have been for much of the book of Joshua. God’s people are battling other nations, and God is giving them victory. To the victor go the spoils, and the Israelites are getting spoiled.\nIn a way, it seems odd that God’s people are fighting at all. Why doesn’t God just wipe out their enemies and move on? Why are the Israelites knee-deep in carnage?\nOne reason is this: God doesn’t want us to be robots. He wants us to step into battle, even spiritual battle, with boldness. Caleb, one of the men who received a great inheritance, was uniquely brave when he spied out the land back in Numbers 13. God fought for him and with him, yes, but He also expected Caleb and his colleagues to be brave.\nToday, we are often prone to fear. If a situation looks bleak, we’ll probably take the easier route. But Caleb can teach us a valuable lesson: bravery comes from trusting in the Lord. God fights for His people, and Caleb knew he was stepping into a battle God Himself would win.\nAs a reward for his courage, Caleb received a wonderful inheritance from God. God is not stingy with His people. He does not send us into hard places and then laugh at us when things don’t go well, nor does He ignore our obedience. God is with us, and He cares about our actions.\nSometimes we don’t think we’re receiving the kind of gift we deserve from God. Maybe we don’t like the outcome of a situation, or maybe we just don’t see it. But as John Piper has rightly said, “God may be doing 10,000 things in your life and you’re aware of three of them.”\nMaybe you’ll never receive a big land or monetary inheritance like Caleb. Maybe you’ll never even know all the gifts God has given you. But that doesn’t mean you don’t spy out foreign lands and head into battle with courage. Because regardless of what you see in this life, one day you will receive the greatest inheritance of all: eternity with your Maker.\nWritten By Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

The rest was short lived, and I wish it wasn’t. Scripture does this—it stirs in us a longing for a more complete and satisfying resolution than the one we’re often given in the moment. And then it promises that one day that resolution will come.\nThe Steven Spielberg / Tom Hanks mini-series Band of Brothers tells the story of the 101st Airborne’s Easy Company, some of the first paratroopers in history. The series follows them through World War 2—from basic training, through D-Day, Bastogne, Market Garden, and all the way to taking Hitler’s Eagle’s Nest.\nBy the time we make it to the end of the ten-hour series—when the allies have secured victory in Europe—Easy Company (and all the other soldiers, and seemingly the land itself) is depleted and weary from war. Victory is theirs, but the cost is never far from view.\nReading through Joshua wearies my heart like that. It is a tale of war. It is unsettling. It would be too simplistic to take a “good guys vs. bad guys” view of this book, since God’s people were not always good, and since their opponents were certainly not all war-mongering barbarians. The conquest of Canaan presents us with a world that was groaning under the weight of the fall. It comes across—to me, anyway—as a hostile, dangerous, unwelcoming place. A war-weary place.\nThe end of Joshua 14 includes what scholars refer to as one of Joshua’s four “land-grant narratives,” in which a portion of land was given to an individual person (Joshua 14:6-15; 15:13-19; 17:3-6; 19:49-50). In this passage, Caleb reminded Joshua that Moses promised Caleb would be given an inheritance of his own (Deuteronomy 1:36). In that exchange between Caleb and Joshua, Caleb insisted that even though he was now 85 years old, he was still strong enough to defeat the Anakim—a formidable group who still lived in the land he would inherit. Caleb said the Lord would be with him as he drove out his foes.\nJoshua gave the land to Caleb. And the result, apparently, was that Caleb did drive out the Anakim, since all we’re told is that he settled Hebron, and then the land had rest from war (Joshua 14:15).\nWhen we read that the land had rest from war, we know from history that the rest did not last. Still, for the people of Israel, the ability to rest from war even for a little while must have come as a needed, though bittersweet, relief. They had defeated their enemies, but they were never far removed from the cost.\nThis mention of rest from war at the end of Joshua 14 is a perfect example of how Scripture stirs a hunger in us for a world that is not broken. There will come a day when our world will rest from war. When people will live at peace. When we will be at peace. That day may not be now, but it is coming. As sure as Christ sits at the right hand of God as the Lord of Heaven and Earth, rest will come. The land, and all who live upon it, will rest from war. Forever. Amen.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

What can we really learn from a lengthy list of names? Surely, Joshua could have condensed this passage to a few sentences and just given us what we needed to know. \nThe passage reads like a land survey. It marks out the territorial possessions of Israel in the north, south, east, and west of the land. The land was divided up before Israel actually conquered it. Just as God promised to give it to them, He faithfully delivered. All they needed to do was follow, and claim what He has set before them. In all, Joshua led the conquest of a total of 31 kings and kingdoms. The lands were of varied topography – valleys and mountains, wilderness and forest and city. It was a fruitful land, all given by God. Joshua gives a list of historical kings. This isn’t fabricated mythology; it is real history. \nIf we take 2 Timothy 3:16 seriously, we know that this passage is “breathed out by God.” It is “profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.” How does Joshua 12 do all these things?\nHow does this passage offer training in righteousness? It shows us that God alone is righteous in all His ways, even in the allotment of lands and in the judgment of kings and nations. This passage records of the conquest of an idolatrous land. God directed Joshua to establish righteousness in the land. This passage asks us: how ought we walk in light of God’s righteousness? How are we also to drive out idolatry from our own hearts? Do we leave some territory unconquered? Is there still a Philistia in my heart?\nHow does this passage offer correction? First, it corrects us for dismissing the value of some passages of Scripture over others. God gave us this passage because we need it. Second, it reminds us that the records of Scripture aren’t myth or legend. We need to remember that they are real space-and-time history. Third, this passage raises questions about what God intends for the land of Israel today. An understanding of God’s providence in history ought to shape how we see our own world.\nHow does this passage offer reproof? We are slow to receive God’s gifts as He offers them. Like Israel, we want to skip steps, make shortcuts, take for granted what He has set before us, and as a result, we often make poor use of the grace He has freely provided. Lord, have mercy.\nWhat does Joshua 12 teach us? God is faithful; He fulfills His covenant promises. God’s promises aren’t merely mystical; they are historical, reliable, and sure. The records of lands, kings, and nations declare: His steadfast love endures forever!\n\n                ",

I was born during the Cold War and was too young to remember the Gulf War.\nThen 9/11 happened. And as a consequence, so did the war in Afghanistan. I was in high school when the Twin Towers fell (sophomore math class, to be exact), and it felt surreal. Death. Destruction. Senseless violence.\nIt seems like war is inevitable. Nearly every person alive today has lived during a war, and many have served in one. Of course, this is what sin does—it brings division and conflict and pain. Wars exist in a post-Genesis 3 world. This passage in Joshua is a stark reminder of that truth.\nIn light of the death and destruction at the hands of the Israelites, one question comes to the surface: why is God commanding all this violence? Isn’t He supposed to be bringing peace? The easy answer is to say that God is good and that His ways are higher than ours; He made a promise to His people and He intended to keep it. And while that explanation is true, it doesn’t make the stench of death any less pungent.\nIt’s important to remember, however, that the stench of death won’t fill the air forever. God promised to give His people land, but that was only a preview. One day, every one of His people who’ve ever lived will inherit a better land.\nIn Revelation 22, the last chapter of the Bible, we see this land:\n“Then he showed me the river of living water, sparkling like crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of the broad street of the city. The tree of life was on both sides of the river, bearing 12 kinds of fruit, producing its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree are for healing the nations, and there will no longer be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and His slaves will serve Him. They will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads. Night will no longer exist, and people will not need lamplight or sunlight, because the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign forever and ever.” (Rev. 22:1-5 HCSB)\nJoshua’s land was apparently spectacular, but it wasn’t perfect. Trees still died. Grass still turned brown. But in the true, final land that all believers will inherit, the tree of life will stand in the land, ensuring that nothing dies again. Death itself will be dead.\nGod’s promise to Joshua was fulfilled in a sinful world. Death was inevitable. Evil had to be dealt with. But God also promises that one day, death will not be inevitable. Evil will take the final deathblow.\nLike Joshua and the Israelites, the land will be ours. But unlike them, we will never leave. We will dwell with God there, in the New Heavens and New Earth, for eternity. He promised. And as the Bible shows us, again and again, God keeps His promises.\nWritten By Brandon D.

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    “In the beginning, God created the heavens and earth…”\nWhenever I read something that sounds a little unusual or difficult to comprehend in the Bible, I usually jump back to Genesis 1:1. It helps me, because if I’m willing to admit that God created all of space and time, everything seen and unseen, then it’s not a far jump to assume He has the power to alter fundamental constants—like the sun standing still, for example.\nBrilliant thinkers, Christian or otherwise, have been divided about what exactly happened in Joshua 10. Some think that the sun literally stood still in the sky for the duration of the battle. Others think it’s a figurative explanation for a really long day.\nRegardless of what you believe about that day, one thing is certain: it was an incredibly unique day in redemptive history. God fought on His people’s behalf and He somehow changed the ebb and flow of the natural world to insure their victory.\nThe book of Joshua confronts any notions we may have of a distant, uninvolved God. I don’t know about you, but it’s easy for me to slip into this way of thinking where I assume God is all-powerful, but He’s a little too busy to keep up with all of my struggles and battles. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, this way of believing tends to keep God at arm’s length.\nThe fact of the matter is that God does care about your daily life, your mundane challenges, and your overwhelming circumstances. Scripture teaches us time and time again that God breaks into creation to care for, shepherd, and lead His people.\nNext time life throws you a curveball or a seemingly insurmountable hurdle, remember the way of God in Joshua. We don’t always have to be David fighting Goliath. We can be Joshua and the Israelites succeeding and overcoming because God has moved heaven and earth on our behalf.\nI don’t know exactly what happened on that day in Joshua 10, but I do know this: God is willing to break into creation to lead and provide for His people. This is what He did when He sent His Son. \nGod’s plans are far greater than ours, and His provision extends far beyond anything we could ever accomplish by our own power. Thank the Lord that we serve a God who acts.\nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    One time I went camping as a young boy. Our leaders warned us of the dangers of the forest, but not much of that stuck in my mind. The only exception was when they told us not to keep food out in the open overnight—because it would attract bears. \nAt the time that didn’t sound too bad to me. I was thinking of a fruit-eating, singing bear like Baloo from The Jungle Book. But Baloo, I was told, was not the sort of bear we would encounter. It was not unheard of for bears to kill people, our leaders said. It would be in our best interest not to attract them by leaving food within reach. So, I made it my mission to search our campsite and make sure all food was put away. I didn’t know much about camping, but I knew I did not want to wake up to a bear trying to eat me.\nJoshua chapters 7 and 8 introduce us to a man named Achan of the tribe of Israel. He has stolen pagan artifacts and hidden them in his camp. Similar to the scene in the movie Heavy Weights, where sugar-addicted children hide enormous amounts of carb-loaded sweets and whatever else their hearts desire under beds, Achan saw a glimmering idol, desired it, took it, and hid it.\nThrough Achan’s sin, he attracted the species of bear to the camp of Israel known as God’s wrath. Though the stash of things he stole was in his possession alone, it affected the nation as a whole. In their disobedience and sin, Israel had violated God’s covenant. This blatant violation caused Israel to suffer a loss in battle.\nDisobedience toward God brings calamity. Obedience to the loving commands of God brings blessing. Achan’s sinful act of disobedience that affected the whole camp is a reminder of the righteous act of obedience by Jesus. Jesus took God’s wrath toward sinners upon Himself—a wrath that didn’t belong to Him. This perfect sacrifice resulted in blessing for all who are in Christ’s family.\nAchan hid what was not his, thinking he was adding to his own riches. But the riches we need are revealed in Jesus. In Christ, God’s riches abound, and those who trust Him alone for salvation will spend an eternity experiencing them. In our obedience to trust Christ, we can know with certainty that Jesus’ obedience guarantees our blessing, not our defeat. We are given Him, forever.\nWritten By Jevon Washington\n \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When Moses stood before the burning bush, God was clear: the ground was holy because He, God almighty, was there. Likewise, when Joshua stood before the heights of Jericho, the Lord was there and the place was holy.\nGod’s holiness is the primary context for understanding the destruction of Jericho. Joshua’s commission to devote to destruction the whole of the city came from God Himself (Joshua 5:14-15). Indeed, even the manner of conquest reinforces the theme of God’s holy sovereignty: Israel was not to conquer by human might, but by the observance of the Sabbath principle. Seven times they marched around the city, not with taunts, but in silence. They were not doing battle; God was.\nOn the seventh day they marched around the city seven times. In prime position was not the commander Joshua, nor the fiercest warriors, but the priests and the ark of the covenant—a sign of God’s presence with them. Joshua might have easily used the words uttered by King Abijah, “Behold, God is with us at our head, and His priests with their battle trumpets to sound the call to battle against you” (2 Chronicles 13:12), or the words of the prophet Jeremiah, “the Lord is with me as a dread warrior” (Jeremiah 20:11). It is a fearful thing when God goes to war.\nI get a bit uneasy at the thought of all that happened there at Jericho. Why was the judgment so fierce? We might be tempted to weigh these events on human scales, but our sinful hearts are all too eager to make light of sin. A holy God can make no such accommodation. Nevertheless, God had been patient. Despite the frequent abominations of idolatry, child sacrifice, gross immorality, occultism, and witchcraft, He had waited 400 years to execute judgment on a wicked people (Genesis 15:16). \nThe inhabitants of Jericho knew who God was (Joshua 2:8-11; 5:1), but apart from Rahab, they were unwilling to acknowledge their sin and His holiness. If God spared Nineveh in the days of Jonah, could He not also spare Jericho? Yet each day, when Israel marched, and the shofar sounded before the walls, the people of Jericho stayed within their ramparts.\nJeremiah declared, “Also I set watchmen over you, saying, ‘Hearken to the sound of the trumpet.’ But they said, ‘We will not hearken’” (Jeremiah 6:17). Jericho would not hearken. They were obstinate in the face of a holy God. The fall of Jericho was a sobering warning: God is holy. He does not trifle with sin. Though He is gracious and patient, when men persist in unrepentance, there comes a day of judgment. \nI am grateful for the conviction this passage brings. Like Rahab, we live in an idolatrous culture, and we are not sinless. But if we have put off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, if we have been buried with Him in baptism and also raised with Him through faith in the powerful working of God, then our hearts may rejoice in thankfulness for His abundant mercy (Colossians 2:11-12). Like Rahab, we have been saved alive in Christ (Joshua 6:25). \nOh, what mercy that God, the holy almighty One, would spare even us!\nWritten By Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Sometimes a certain song will come on and, all of a sudden, I’m transported in my mind to a time and place where something significant happened in my life. Or I’ll drive down a particular stretch of road and remember an event that happened there. I’m not necessarily looking for the memory, but it seems to be tied to the song or the place.\nIt is fascinating, isn’t it, that God made us this way? We are meaning-makers. There is something eternal in us that knows to link moments and places in our past to the significance of our present and to our hope for the future.\nIn Joshua 4-5, Israel stood in a place they had long-anticipated: the banks of the Jordan River. Those waters represented the end of their wilderness wanderings. God, because He is an artist, parted the waters so Israel could cross over on dry ground, effectively bookending their wilderness wanderings with the same miracle performed twice.\nAs they crossed the dried-up floor of the Jordan, with the ark of the Lord leading the way, the Lord told Joshua to instruct the men to pull twelve stones from the riverbed—twelve stones no person should have ever had access to, were it not for the powerful hand of God. They stacked the stones into an ebenezer, or a monument, designed to elicit questions from their meaning-making children who would want to know what that strange and deliberate pile meant.\nWhat did those stones mean? They pointed to the past. They meant God had preserved Israel through famine, slavery, wilderness, and war to bring them to this place from which they would serve Him. They meant that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God (Hebrews 10:31), since many of their countrymen died before they could cross over. They meant that these people were tied to Abraham’s God by a covenant oath.\nBut those stones also pointed to their future. The memorial reminded the people of their ongoing relationship with God. They were stones that reminded the people that God was not finished accomplishing His redemptive plan. Those stones prompted memories of the God to Whom they belonged.\nThose stones carry meaning for us as well. God delivers His people. In Christ, all our sorrows will be taken. In Christ, we will cross over from this wild place to a Kingdom of light and life and joy and peace. The people in the book of Joshua lived between a promise made and a promise kept—between the promise that God would bless the world through Abraham’s offspring, and the empty tomb of Christ, that grand miracle that provides otherwise impossible passage from this life to the next. \nThe empty tomb, with its stone rolled away by the very finger of God, is our ebenezer now.\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Recently I spent a few days in New York City. Having previously lived in Chicago, I smugly assumed I had the whole rush hour public transit situation completely under control.\nThat was, of course, until I found myself heading up a staircase out of the subway, completely against the flow of pedestrian traffic. I have never felt more like a fish trying to swim upstream. I had to carefully shoulder my way through the crowd to the top of the stairs and back to street level. Thankfully, other than my pride getting a little scuffed up, I didn’t sustain any injuries.\nI’m still not sure if I made a mistake and went up the wrong stairwell or if I was just reverse-commuting across town at the wrong time of day. Either way, one thing is certain: I was definitely struggling to move against the predominant flow of everyone around me.\nMoving against the flow is a difficult task. It takes faith to trust that you’re moving in the right direction, and it takes courage to sustain the course. I’m not so certain that my subway predicament was the result of a faithful or courageous spirit, but I am convinced that Rahab was able to stay the course because of her belief in the God of Israel and her courage to finish what she started.\nRahab risked much by harboring the spies. She risked her comforts and possessions, her life and the lives of her family. If any of the leaders in Jericho had learned of her actions, she most likely would have faced a punishment worse than death. To say that treason was frowned upon is putting it lightly.\nBut Rahab had heard of the great deeds of the LORD and she knew He was the only true God. To follow Him, to honor Him, and to trust Him was to risk much. She was swimming against the flow of what her neighbors and friends would have thought sensible and right. She knew that her national allegiances needed to take a back seat to what was fitting in the eyes of the only true God, but she had to risk everything to link arms with His people.\nHave you ever had to make a hard or unpopular decision? Maybe it was amongst friends, or perhaps it was at work. Have you ever been challenged to move against the predominant way of thinking or acting? Maybe God is calling you to make a stand, take a risk, or love in a vulnerable way.\nFollowing God doesn’t mean we spend our whole lives protesting culture. Sometimes, like Rahab, we just have to make quiet but resolute decisions to move in a different direction. Rahab didn’t start picketing Jericho. Rather, she bravely and faithfully followed God. \nNot every season requires us to swim aggressively upstream, but some do. If this is one of those seasons, lean on God in faith. He will supply the courage and provision that you need. If you leap out in faith like Rahab did, you might just be surprised by the wonders He works through you. \nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    You remember that scene in The Fellowship of The Ring when the travelers emerge from the Mines of Moria? They are devastated, forlorn, almost hopeless. Gandalf, their leader, was dead. What were they to do? How would they finish their journey and accomplish their mission?\nThat must have been how the people of Israel felt when Moses died. Who would lead them? How would they face the conquest to take the Promised Land? They stood on the brink of an unknown land populated by warrior peoples and even giants. They had just wandered in the wilderness for more than forty years. Their future was far from certain.\nExcept it wasn’t uncertain because God had made a covenant. He had declared that He would uphold His side – to make Israel a great nation in this land – if they upheld theirs. (If they didn’t and decided they no longer needed to obey, the consequences would be dire.)  But the nature of God’s promise meant that the person leading Israel wasn’t the key to their success; obedience to God’s law and trust in His Word was.\nWell before Joshua led Israel across the Jordan River into battle, God had made a promise: “I will give you this land, just be strong and courageous.” He promised to go ahead of the people and fight for them. The battle was His. The people simply needed to trust and obey. \nBut camped on the border of the future, Joshua needed reassurance. And God gave it to him. He didn’t give Joshua strategy or a battle plan or a pep talk. He gave Himself. He said, “Remember My Word. Keep it with you at all times. Never forget it and always obey it. Do this and the land will be yours. Be strong and courageous because I am with you and am going before you” (Joshua 1:8-9, my paraphrase).\nStrength and courage in the Lord and obedience to God’s Word – these are the themes of Joshua. It is not a book about a man as much as it is a book about God establishing His people. Joshua is the man God appointed to lead Israel. But his leadership rests fully on faith and obedience.\nThis is stunning in its simplicity. What are God’s people called to when facing adversity? Or when we are called to lead above our capacity? Or when we have a challenge ahead of us that seems insurmountable? We are called to be strong and courageous because God is with us. \nOur strength is not our own. Our successes are not our own. God’s hand guides and works as we follow His Word in obedience, and it will root us and establish us.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

As we come to the end of this book, we see a nation of people who have taken step after step away from the Lord. We’ve seen Israel take on the religious convictions and practices of their Canaanite neighbors. We’ve seen them abandon God. And we’ve seen their world unraveling.\nIn this last chapter, infighting among the tribes of Israel has led to Benjamin’s defeat at the hands of the others. But now those other tribes are beginning to fear that their victory will lead to Benjamin’s extinction. Panged with regret, they assemble to come up with a solution to ensure Benjamin’s survival. Their answer to this problem: wives. The tribes will find and deliver wives for the men of Benjamin so they can build up their numbers to a sustainable level.\nAs you read this chapter, let the ugliness of what’s happening hit you. People are being slaughtered. Oaths to never forgive are being taken. Young women—probably teenagers—are being kidnapped and given over to the men of Benjamin as part of a solution to a problem Israel brought upon itself. \nThis is where the road to apostasy had led God’s people—to violence and human trafficking, to vengeful hearts and survival of the fittest. They no longer look anything like the “blessing to the world” God told Abraham they would become. \nWhy is this book in the Bible? It certainly isn’t a book about how to follow after the Lord. If anything, it’s the opposite—a book about how to abandon the Lord. So where is the redemption in this book?\nThe redemption in Judges is in the ache for a king, for someone to come and lead God’s people with righteousness and peace. For someone to seek the Lord’s counsel and to love God’s people. For someone to not only serve themselves, but to lay down their life for their friends. \nWhen looking at the Bible as a whole, we see that Judges highlights Israel’s desperate need for God. The books of 1 and 2 Samuel follow, describing how Israel gets its king in young David—a man after God’s own heart and a focused warrior whose struggle is for peace. But even more than that, Israel’s need for a king is addressed in Christ, the eternal King who rules at the right hand of God as our Prince of Peace. \nOur need for Jesus, the bright morning star, runs deeper than we know or are willing to admit (Revelation 22:16). But the darkness of a book like Judges helps us see how much we need Him, and gives us cause to rejoice that He has come. The Lord has not left us in darkness. In fact, “In him was life, and that life was the light of men. That light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome it” (John 1:4–5). Amen. Thanks be to God.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

It seems like every day, one nation somewhere is at war with another nation. Death abounds. Suffering persists. Peace is nowhere in sight.\nWe pick up today in Judges chapter 20, where another battle is about to take place. After the rape and murder of a Levite’s concubine in chapter 19, four hundred thousand armed men from the tribes of Israel (except for the tribe of Benjamin) are commissioned to exact revenge and justice on her oppressors, men from the Benjaminite city of Gibeah. A civil war was at hand between the unrepentant tribe of Benjamin and the other tribes of Israel. After two costly battles for the combined Israelite forces, they continue to call on the Lord for help. \nThe Lord tells them to go back into battle and promises them He will give them victory the next day. His hand alone is mightier than every sword wielded by their foes.\nIt’s easy to focus here on the battle itself. We ask, “Why would God allow so many people to die? Why does the Bible condone war if death is the enemy? Why doesn’t He just fix everything right now?”\nIn some ways, we don’t have all the answers to these questions. There is a mystery to God’s work that we couldn’t understand, even if it were explained to us (Romans 11:33–36). That said, the Bible is not entirely silent on this issue, either.\nThe Bible records human history, so we should not be surprised to see sin and death and war in its pages and in our world. Indeed, God would be lying to us if He didn’t show us in Scripture how badly sin has affected us. That said, we know for sure that He will make all things new. This is clear throughout the Old Testament (Genesis 3:15; Ezekiel 36) and into the New Testament (Revelation 21–22). Our passage today gives us a glimpse of this. On the one hand, rape and murder and war are the result of life in a fallen world. On the other hand, we see God as a good Judge, dispensing justice for the oppressed and marginalized. In a perfect world, God does not need to judge evil; in a broken world, He would be a monster not to.\nPraise be to God that through Christ His wrath toward evil has been absorbed for us. Jesus went to the cross so we don’t have to. He took on the rightful judgment of God toward sin, bearing it all as a sacrifice for us. And by the Spirit, we can now walk in newness of life, working every day to join God in His mission of redeeming all things for His glory and our good (Matthew 28:18-20; 2 Corinthians 5:11-21).\nWritten by Brandon D.

Judges 19 should enrage us at the way a servant of the temple (the Levite) disregards God’s ways in order to please himself, and then plays the victim as if he were the one most deeply sinned against. We need passages like this to get our blood hot with indignation against rampant evil and wickedness. \nThe question is, what will we do with our righteous anger? As depraved and backward as this chapter sounds, injustice and corruption like this still exist in our world. Women are still used, abused, and discarded by men as if they were merely property. Church leaders act like they were the ones wronged when they are exposed for their indifference and pride. We may be tempted to take matters into our own hands and get vigilante justice. Alternatively, we may become indifferent to the needs of those hurting and compound the injustice against them with our own passivity. What will be done to uphold true justice in this world?\nChristians for generations have wrestled with these questions as we seek to live as people of faith and action in the world. Thankfully, Jesus shows us how to be full of mercy toward those downtrodden and broken, while bringing truth to the powers that create systems of injustice. He brought truth to power by His righteous life, and calls us to seek justice in His name. He was murdered unjustly because of our sin and rebellion. He was raised to life again and will bring full and final justice for all people when He returns (2 Timothy 4:1). \nWe should be broken over the brokenness within this world, within the church, and within ourselves (Jeremiah 8:21). Indeed, Judges 19 calls us to weep over sin. But Jesus calls us to trust Him for the forgiveness of our sin. \nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Sometime last year, my father-in-law was certified to do controlled burnings on his farm. He had to go through extensive training so he could learn the procedures requisite to carrying out what is understood to be the lawful burning of brush on his property. He was literally licensed to play with fire. Needless to say, my three sons thought this was the coolest thing ever. After all, what little boys wouldn’t want to take a flamethrower and burn things! My mother-in-law, however, was insistent that the boys shouldn’t be allowed to be out with their grandfather while he did the burnings, since there was an enormous threat of getting burned, or of a wildfire starting and consuming everything in its path—including my boys. \nOnce individuals practice idolatry, there is the risk of it spreading like wildfire. We see this throughout Israel’s history, and perhaps nowhere so clearly as in the account of the Danites and Micah in Judges 17–18. No sooner had the members of the tribe of Dan heard about the household gods and personal Levite that Micah had taken to himself, than they wanted those things for themselves. \nThis was not pagan idolatry in the strictest sense of the term. This was synchronized idolatry among the covenant people of God. That’s what made it so exceedingly dangerous for them, and so abominable to the Lord. Micah had done what so many have sought to do throughout human history—he personalized his religion so that it would fit according to his own desires. The Danites then envied the idolatrous liberation that Micah had seemed to attain. Once they took the household gods and the Levitical priest to themselves, the synchronized idolatry burned among them like wildfire, and it burned for many generations (Judges 18:30). \nThere is a warning here for us today. While we may not be setting up carved idols in our homes or among our friends and family members, we are constantly being encouraged to synchronize the true worship of God based on Scripture with what seems to fit with our own desires and the practices and values of our culture. The path to hell really is paved with good intentions. However, idolatry is a wildfire of rebellion against the Most High God. \nJesus came into this world to be the Great High Priest of His people. He lived and died and rose again in order to bring us into the presence of God and to make us a people who worship Him in spirit and truth. Jesus dealt with the wildfire of our idolatry by extinguishing the fire of God’s wrath as He hung on the cross for our idolatrous sin. When we keep our eyes fixed on Him, we take them off the idolatries of this world and in our own hearts.\nWritten by Nick Batzig \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    There is a subtle but deadly danger lurking in modern Christianity. It is found in a false religion that masquerades as true faith. This false faith seeks to control or tame God, recreating Him into a more palatable God we are comfortable with. It is found in the hearts of those who ignore or reject the commands of God. Too many people would rather have a god who does not contradict them or say “no” to their desires. This is idolatry, plain and simple. The mirror of Micah’s narrative in Judges is a haunting reminder of this.\nJudges chapter 17 opens with a thieving son (Micah), an unjustly forgiving mother, and both of them committing apostasy together. In the discussion between the two, it is revealed that some of the stolen silver is used for pagan purposes—namely, to violate God’s explicit command against making idols. Micah created a personal shrine apart from God’s tabernacle, and established his own priesthood apart from God’s directed system. This was the homemade worship of a homemade god. Remember these words of warning from Leviticus: “Do not make idols for yourselves … for I am the LORD your God” (26:1).\nThe devastating truth of this text is that Micah is attempting to worship God as he pleases. However, this is a form of worship that does not please God. It is the essence of idolatry. An idol is not necessarily a statue; it is most readily a posture of the heart. Idol worship reveals that we do not want to submit to the one true God as He is. Therefore, we depict God as we like and worship Him as we please. In the end, we will find that we are not worshiping the real God, but rather an idol that cannot express the full range of God’s glory, and cannot deliver the full force of God’s power. Idols can never deliver on their promises.\nIn verse 8 of Judges 17, the narrative takes another turn toward idolatry. Micah meets a Levite who had departed from Bethlehem in Judah in order to find a place to stay. This priest was dissatisfied with God’s arrangements for his life, and Micah was all too happy for this priest to legitimize his idolatrous shrine and homemade religion. So the priest found his place, and Micah wrongly thought he had secured the Lord’s blessing by hosting the priest.\nMicah wanted a proper Levitical priest to justify his rebellion. The priest wanted to live out his role according to his own desires. Both Micah and the Levite were shifting their lives, even their convictions, to do what was most comfortable for themselves. They rebelled against the one true God, and made a god of their own.\nThis is what happens when you eliminate anything from the Bible that offends your sensibilities and crosses your will. If you pick and choose what you want to believe and reject the rest, you will never have a God who can contradict you, only one who suits your desires. The emptiness of a Micah-like religion is shown when you try to recreate God in your own image. The God of the Bible has revealed Himself as He is. You either believe in Him, trust Him, and turn to Him in submission, or you pursue the detestable false idol of self-made religion.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The Samson story hurts my heart. Reading it today, it struck a particular nerve. Let me try to explain what I mean. One thing I see in my own heart, and in the culture all around me, is a tendency to treat almost everything as a potential punch line to a joke. I worry that we don’t take enough of life seriously, and as a result, don’t take our own lives seriously.\nSamson was a man with a gift—a God-given gift. In the story of Delilah’s attempt to seduce him to learn the source of his strength, Samson treats this God-given power as a curiosity or a parlor trick. It’s almost like he and Delilah are playing a cat-and-mouse game, and he’s just messing with her.\nSamson doesn’t seem to regard his power as a gift to be used. He doesn’t seem to care that Delilah has openly told him she wants to learn how to break him. He doesn’t seem to revere the Lord much at all. We all know the type—the person born with a gift, who seems bent on squandering it for personal pleasure. It’s a hollow existence.\nThis struck a nerve with me today because I believe we live in an age when reverence is in decline. I worry how this loss of a sense of the sacred is shaping us as people and as a society. \nWhen Samson finally tells Delilah his secret—that his strength is in his hair—two things happen. First, Delilah gets to work stripping Samson of his gift. And second, we discover that Samson didn’t understand his gift. Judges 16:20 tells us that when Samson’s hair was cut off, it wasn’t his strength that left him; it was actually the Lord’s strength that left him. Samson’s strength was not merely physical. It was spiritual.\nGod has promised to never leave us or forsake us. We can rest in knowing this is true because He has purchased us by the blood of Christ and we are now and forever His. The deal is done. But God also tells us that when we bury our talents or use His gifts for our own pleasure at the expense of others, it is possible that His discipline will be to remove those gifts, or at least the opportunity to use them. I don’t want to live that way, but I see the potential for that in my heart. I bet you do too.\nAs you read this story about a very familiar character in Scripture, examine your own heart before the Lord. Do you treat sacred gifts as playthings? Do you use your unique abilities to exploit others, or to serve them? Do you treat your talents and gifts as personal traits, or as resources for the good of those around you? Our gifts don’t come from ourselves. They come from the Lord. May we take that truth seriously, and use our gifts for the good of others and for the glory of God.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Samson strikes out on his adventures equipped with incredible strength, overcoming his enemies. He spends most of his time affiliating with the worldly Philistines, and while we are told that Samson “judged Israel twenty years” (Judges 15:20), we rarely see him actually serving his own people. And the Israelites don’t seem to be aware that he is judging them either. “Don’t you realize that the Philistines rule us?” they ask (v.11). \nSamson hardly seems like a hero of the faith, yet we find him listed in the “hall of faith” in Hebrews chapter 11. Indeed, we see many moments of seeming spiritual triumph. “The Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon him” at Lehi, as Samson single-handedly overthrew the Philistines there (Judges 15:14). It is difficult to know how to weigh this gift of the Spirit against the rash blood-feuds and turmoil in which Samson is constantly embroiled.  \nNot all of Samson’s actions are unjustifiable. In fact, in many ways the book of Judges is a bit ambiguous, leaving lots of room for interpretation. It can seem as if Samson is simultaneously rash and righteously indignant. He takes personal vengeance upon the Philistines, but also strikes a blow against the oppressors of Israel. He bases his actions on one of the most fundamental principles of justice: “I have done to them what they did to me” (v.11). Of course, this very principle is also cited by the Philistines: “We have come to tie Samson up and pay him back for what he did to us” (v.10). Human justice falls short, and man finds himself in an eternal cycle of revenge.\nThis cycle of revenge, like the cycle of the judges, is the human story. In some seasons, God sends human deliverers like Samson, imperfect though they may be, who endure affliction and persecution, yet whose weakness is turned to God’s purposes (Hebrews 11:34). \nThe cycle is unfulfilling and unending, except for the intrusion of unmerited grace. In Christ, God gives us what we don’t deserve: deliverance. Unlike Samson, Christ is perfect and holy, truly set apart. He took upon Himself the brunt of God’s just wrath. Unlike the temporary rescue of the judges, Christ’s salvation is eternal.\nGod has heard the cry of His people: “Save us, LORD our God, and gather us from the nations!” (Psalm 106:47). And He has sent His salvation in our just Deliverer, Jesus Christ.\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Editor’s Note: Today’s devotional initially appeared with biblical errors that have since been corrected (our mistake, not the author’s). We are committed to faithfully reading and presenting God’s Word and appreciate your grace and partnership today.\nA number of years ago, I met a famous person I had long respected from afar. This is always a tense experience, isn’t it? Most of us, I think, when we encounter famous people, get nervous to some degree. It happens to me less now than it did before because I have interacted with a number of “famous” Christians through my job. But still, especially when meeting some people, my palms get sweaty. Beyond that tension, I’m afraid that when I meet a famous person he or she is not going to be nice. Meeting someone we admire only to learn he or she is human is disorienting and disappointing.\nIn Judges 14, we continue to read about Samson, a judge appointed by God, a distinguished leader of God’s people, and a massive disappointment. We have already been exposed to Samson and his background, but it is here in chapter 14 that we see his disobedience. In verses 1–4, Samson disobeys the will of his parents and seeks a Philistine woman “because she seemed right to [him]”  (v. 7). This is a foreshadowing of his weakness. For all his physical strength, for all his natural gifting, he is proving to be weak in character. \nSamson shares a riddle with Philistine men at his marriage feast. He will pay them handsomely if they solve the riddle within a week, and they will pay him if they don’t. Because they have trouble solving the riddle, they threaten Samson’s wife, which leads her to squeeze the answer out of him, despite Samson not giving the answer to his mother or father. He loses the bet because his wife gives the Philistine men the answer. This leads Samson to kill thirty other Philistine men in order to pay up his end of the bet.\nFlashes of Samson’s strength, reliance on the Spirit of God, and anointing give glimpses of what the true Savior of God’s people, Jesus, would one day look like. Some may have thought Samson would be the deliverer of Israel, but unfortunately, he sought his own way and was undermined by his weakness. \nIn Isaiah 11 we read that the Savior of the world would shoot up from the stump of Jesse, in the line of David, and deliver the people of God from their disobedience and weakness. His justice would be righteous because His wisdom is from above. Jesus, our perfect Judge (Matthew 25:31-46), “will not judge by what he sees with his eyes, he will not execute justice by what he hears with his ears” (Isaiah 11:3).\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

Even if the child is their third or fourth, there is still a palpable sense of joy in the room. No parent I’ve spoken with in the hospital has shown me their newborn child and said, “Look at him. He’s so ordinary.” In Scripture, God often interrupted dark days with the announcement of a child’s birth. The birth of the child signaled hope, that God was at work even when things were dark. \nThink about the beginning of Exodus. Pharaoh forgot about Joseph and enslaved Israel for 400 years. The dark days of Israel’s slavery seemed as if they would continue unabated. But then God protected Moses, one of the Hebrew children who should have been put to death. Here in Judges 13, Israel repeated the cycle of falling away from the Lord, and the Philistines ruled over them for more than a generation. Then the angel of the Lord appeared to Manoah’s wife to announce that she would have a son. Ruth gave birth to Obed during the days when the judges ruled in Israel. The book of 1 Samuel begins with the narrative of Samuel’s birth, and uses wording reminiscent of Judges chapter 13.\nWe know where this is headed, don’t we? The Old Testament narrative concluded, and then Israel did not hear from God for 400 years. They languished under the yoke of Roman rule, but God ended His silence with an angel visiting Zechariah, telling the priest that his barren wife would give birth to a son, John (Luke 1:5–25). And then the angel Gabriel visited a young virgin to tell her she would have a Son who would save His people from their sins (Luke 1:26–38).\nThe announcement of Samson’s birth came with the declaration that he would be “a Nazarite to God from birth” (Judges 13:5). Following the instructions of Numbers 6:1-12, he would be “holy to the Lord” all the days that he was separated from the things forbidden by the vow.\nThe hope God brings to His people is always accompanied by a call to be holy. This summons is not a call to abstain from cutting our hair, but rather a devotion of the entire heart, soul, mind, and strength to God. We give Him our whole selves, cutting ourselves off from the influence of the world around us, and putting our indwelling sin to death in Christ Jesus. We are not alone in the fight to be holy. It does not rely on us having enough fortitude to say “no” to temptation because God is always at work in us through the power of His Spirit. \nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

It was the day of Jake’s “intervention.” No, Jake was not a drug user or an alcoholic, but he did have a persistent issue that threatened to damage all of his friendships. You see, Jake had a frustrating tendency to break off plans at the last minute. \nOn this particular occasion, Ross, Jake, their wives, and a few other friends had planned a Saturday afternoon cookout. Ross’s wife had bought the burgers, brats, and all the fixings. They’d set up the patio furniture and the corn hole boards. They were less than an hour away from the party when the phone rang. A college buddy had offered Jake two tickets to the game that afternoon. He’d gotten a better offer, so he ditched the cookout and headed to the game instead. \nNow, this was hardly the first time that had happened, so Ross was angry. Later that night, he drove over to Jake’s place to confront him. When Jake tells the story now, he changes his voice to show just how gruff Ross was: “We can NOT be friends if you keep doing this. I want your friendship. I need your friendship, but your word has to MEAN something.”\nFriendship is built on fidelity. Broken commitments, on the other hand, can kill. Jephthah was a man who, on the surface, seemed to care a lot about keeping his vows. In fulfillment of a rash promise, he sinfully sacrificed his own daughter (Judges 11:30-40). And when the Ephraimites broke their covenant obligation to fight with him against the Ammonites (Psalm 78:9-11, 67-72), he turned his sword against their entire tribe, wiping out 42,000 men (Judges 12:4-6).\nBut while Jephthah seemed to care about vows, his rashness shows us the instability and infidelity of his heart. He was faithful to himself but lacked fidelity to God’s ways. In his heart, Jephthah only did what was right in his own eyes. His mouth spoke too quickly, and his words brought futility and destruction —both to his own household and to the Israelite tribes he was supposed to lead. Jephthah had a short judgeship—just six years compared to an entire generation for the judges who’d preceded him (Judges 3:11,30; 5:31; 8:28)—and it marked the beginning of a downward spiral for the nation. \nPerhaps you’ve never been as rash as Jephthah, but we’ve all been enamored with the “better offer.” It’s tempting to let our eyes wander to the next best thing, rather than being faithful to the friendships, spouse, family, or church community where we’ve been called. \nWhere do we find the strength to be faithful? Where do we find the power to keep our vows? We can only find this strength in remembering that God has been faithful to us. He is a loyal God who kept His promises by sending Jesus Christ to save us. Our God is faithful and true (Revelation 19:11), and in Christ, all of His promises are “Yes” and “Amen” (2 Corinthians 1:20).  \nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

It’s a tragedy that reads like a Coen brothers’ movie, like Inside Llewyn Davis or A Serious Man, demonstrating a consistent, unmitigated downward spiral. Even the quick glimmers of hope propel people into deeper and darker circumstances. \nJudges 11 is no exception to that sort of downward progression into darkness, lawlessness, and brutality. It is not so much a handbook of how things should be, but rather a lesson in how terribly dark things become when God’s people abandon His guidance. \nJephthah came from humble and painful beginnings. The son of a prostitute, he was driven from his tribe by his half brothers (Judges 11:1). Had the Law of the Lord been faithfully taught in Israel in those days, and had the Israelites chosen to faithfully follow it, Jephthah would’ve had a much different framework for his decisions. \nLeviticus chapters 18 and 20—which significantly predate the Judges period and should have informed Israel’s conduct and culture during that time—unequivocally condemn child and human sacrifice. In fact, while many of Israel’s neighbors practiced child sacrifice, the punishment for such an act in Israel was death (Leviticus 20:2). \nReaders typically have a variety of reactions to Jephthah’s decision to fulfill his rash oath. Some believe that his decision to keep his word was honorable; others find it barbaric and evil. Frankly, it seems like the inciting problem was that he made such a foolish oath to begin with. The oath that Jephthah saw as piety, we can see now as utter folly.\nIn His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus offers a clear and helpful teaching on how we should make oaths, promises, and vows: \n“Again, you have heard that it was said to our ancestors,\n‘You must not break your oath, but you must keep your oaths to the Lord.’ But I tell you, don’t take an oath at all: either by heaven, because it is God’s throne; or by the earth, because it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King” (Matthew 5:33-35).\nHe goes on to give a bit of rationale for this teaching, saying, “‘Do not swear by your head, because you cannot make a single hair white or black’” (Matthew 5:36). \nThough Jesus did not mention Jephthah’s actions directly, it’s reasonable to think that many of His Jewish listeners would’ve been very familiar with the story. While it would’ve been easy for them to see the foolishness apparent in Judges 11, Jesus helps them see the ways that this sort of hasty and faulty thinking has seeped into their own lives. His loving, compassionate, and wise counsel to His listeners also extends to us now: Our “yes” should mean “yes,” and our “no” should mean “no.” “Anything more than this is from the evil one” (Matthew 5:37).\nOur speech is an action. What you say and how you fulfill it is indicative of who you are and Whose you are. Jesus, in His lovingkindness, wants to remind us that we do not and cannot control or know all the hairs on our own head. When we make rash pronouncements and yoke ourselves to unpredictable variables rather than the eternally consistent God, we back ourselves into a corner. The real foolishness of swearing upon “your mother’s life” or “your wife’s honor” or even, as many do, “to God,” is that while you may be earnest, you do not control the future—not even a little bit. \nLetting your “yes” be “yes” and your “no” be “no” frees you from the uncontrollable uncertainty of tomorrow. It also strengthens the weight of your simple words in making commitments. Swearing “to XYZ” might seem like a stronger binding, but the real strength lies in simple and wise straight-shooting answers, rooted in a life anchored to Christ.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    With two daughters under the age of five, it seems like my daily routine is trying to manage their fickle emotions. On the one hand, both are sweet and kind in their own unique ways, yet defiant and stubborn on the other. One moment, they want to love and hug one another and their parents. The next, they’re itching for a fight. Around and around we go, ad nauseam. \nAt my best, I can be extremely patient with them. I can pray in the moment and remind myself that God is patient with me, and He will help me to be patient with them. At my worst (and probably most often), I can be short-tempered and impatient, doing anything I can think of to appease the situation and have control over their emotions. Of course, as anyone with kids knows, trying to control a child’s emotions is like trying to contain the force of a hurricane with an umbrella.\nThe story of Israel in the Bible is not much different than what I just described about my own household. Just when you think Israel recognizes the goodness of the Lord and trusts Him to lead them, their hearts turn on a dime, as they grumble and complain about His apparent reluctance or inability to meet their every need in that moment. \nIn our passage today, the Israelites engage in the worship of other gods. It seems they do this primarily because of the instant gratification of receiving mercy from other nations. For them, the most expedient way to obtain comfort was to give into the demands of the other nations, bowing down and worshiping those gods over the Lord.\nRightly so, God is unhappy with this situation. He reminds them that He’s the one who delivered them from slavery in Egypt and so much more. As a result, He tells them He won’t deliver them—He’ll leave it up to the gods of the other nations.\nNow, unlike me when I’m frustrated or impatient with my children, God’s anger is righteous and perfect. He is not snapping at them because He is spiritually immature or because He wants His own comfort; rather, He’s frustrated because He knows the other gods cannot deliver them. He knows that worshiping idols will lead to not only immediate, but eternal, destruction.\nJust like my daughters, Israel’s hearts can be fickle and immature. But unlike me, God is consistently and immovably loving and patient and kind. His discipline is never a result of sinful emotion, but out of His perfect love for us (Hebrews 12:4-11). May we remember that God’s commands, and even His judgment, are ultimately for our good and His glory—found most clearly in the death and resurrection of Jesus and by the sealing of the Holy Spirit.\nWritten by Brandon D.

It seems like today’s reading was taken from a Hollywood plotline instead of the pages of Holy Scripture. Yet, here we are in the midst of a family conflict that would make the disputes of any mob family pale in comparison.\nIf we see anything in this story it should be ourselves and the corruption of our own hearts. Any one of us could be Abimelech. Instead of looking to the Lord and trusting in Him to provide a leader when his father Jerubbaal (Gideon) died, Abimelech took matters into his own hands. He took power by force, murdering any potential rivals to a supposed “throne” in Israel. He did whatever he thought necessary in order to win status and authority. We’re capable of doing the same.\nWe may read Abimelech’s story and feel as if we would never stoop so low as to murder our own brothers, yet Jesus teaches that whenever we possess hatred in our hearts toward our brothers we are murderers (Matthew 5:21-22). We may see the brazen way in which Abimelech torches his own people and his own city out of pure spite for their betrayal of him and think we’d never be so wicked. But each of us is capable of the same hatred and wickedness. Whenever we are divisive, gossiping, playing for power in the church, we believe and behave just as Abimelech did. We may scoff at the cowardly way Abimelech dies by having his servant armor-bearer run him through so that his reputation isn’t ruined because he was killed by a woman. But we, too, can be cowardly and seek to protect our reputations, lying and manipulating others to make ourselves look heroic instead of helpless.\nAll of this shows our radical need for God’s forgiveness and empowering grace. We need redemption. We need a Savior. Tragically, there is no redemption in Judges chapter 9—it’s all bad. But we do have a Savior who will rescue us from the curse our evil should bring upon us. We have Christ who died because of the anger we have toward our brothers. Christ laid down His life for our gossiping tongues, hateful hearts, and divisive actions against His people. His righteousness becomes ours through faith, so we don’t have to manipulate others to keep our reputation. Our identity is secure in Jesus Christ. \nWe are capable of great evil—just like Abimelech. But we are deeply loved in Christ, and His Spirit has given us new hearts and a desire to obey. Let’s repent and turn to Him again today. Let us be true worshipers of the Father in Spirit and in truth (John 4:23-24).\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The church of God throughout the ages has always stumbled over a desire for success, sophistication, and status. The quest for one or more of these things in the church inevitably produces discontentment in the hearts of professing believers. A vicious cycle often follows, breeding disunity and then disdain. There is, of course, an irony to the quest for success, sophistication, and status. God’s ways are completely unlike our ways. God chooses to use what is weak and unimpressive in the world’s sight in order to confound the wisdom of the world. \nWe see this principle at work in the account of Gideon and his 300 men. God cut back Gideon’s army so that He would get the glory. We see it even more clearly in the account of Jesus Christ crucified. The Son of God came to die in weakness, foolishness, and failure in the sight of the world. In this way, God received maximum glory in the salvation of His people through His death on the cross. \nAfter Gideon and his reduced army of 300 return from the initial defeat of the Midianites, his brethren from the tribe of Ephraim scolded him for not calling them to come and assist him in battle. Gideon had been obedient to the call of God to cut back his army so that God would get the glory. Now, a division began to brew over who should get the glory with Gideon and his men. After wisely defusing the anger of the Ephraimites by humbly appealing to God’s glory, Gideon went back to the work of destroying the remainder of God’s enemies among the army of the Midianites. \nThis is a beautiful picture of the wisdom and power of Christ crucified that the apostle Paul mentions in his first letter to the Corinthians. When dealing with a division that was raging in the church over a desire for sophistication and worldly status, Paul reminded the members of that affluent church that God was glorified in the foolishness of the message preached. While many Christians strive after worldly success, sophistication, and status, God levels our pride and unites us together in Christian love by reminding us that “Christ is the wisdom and power of God” (1:24), though He is foolishness and weakness in the sight of the world. May we never lose sight of this precious and all-encompassing truth.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Christianity is counter-cultural in ways that demand absolute trust in God from its adherents. One of the most notable differences between the message of Christianity and the message of American society is found in the relationship between power and weakness. In our culture, power is found in self-trust and subjecting others to our will. In Christianity, power is found in trusting God and submitting to His will. In Christianity, weakness is the way to true victory. \nThe testimony of Scripture recounts the many ways God has used the inadequacy and weakness of His servants to accomplish His will and accomplish His victory. The pattern is simple: When we fall at the Lord’s feet in our weakness, we will find the victory and power that comes from His hand. Judges 7 may be the most striking reminder that weakness is, in fact, the way.\nIn Judges 7, God teaches Gideon and his army to depend on Him in light of insurmountable odds they faced. The enemy armies, the Midianites, were 135,000 troops strong in facing Gideon and his 32,000 men. Place yourself in Gideon’s shoes for a moment and consider how terrifying this prospect would be. Based solely on human calculations, Gideon and his army have no chance.\nIn light of these odds, we read one of the most amazing sentences in the Bible. God tells Gideon, “You have too many troops” (v. 2). Yes, you read that right—too many troops. The reason for this assessment is even more staggering. Even though Gideon has more than 100,000 fewer men in his army, if God were to grant them victory, they would still be tempted to claim that victory by their own power. Therefore, God commands Gideon to send the fearful men home, resulting in 22,000 troops departing, and leaving 10,000 to fight. But that is still too many. God further shrinks the total, to just 300 men. Gideon and his army were stripped down so much that they had two choices: either fully trust God or perish.\nIsn’t it often the case that in times where we are tempted to trust in our abilities and power, God often removes our foundations of self-confidence in order that we would more fully trust in Him? Have you ever considered that one of the greatest dangers of victory is that of increased self-reliance? Spiritually, that can be more dangerous than defeat. You cannot be too small for God to use you.\nLet us be reminded of Gideon, a man from a weak family, from a weak tribe, with only a handful of men to fight the enemy. All of these factors lead Gideon and his men to understand that their victory came from God’s power, not their own. When it came to their victory, not one Israelite lifted a finger in battle; the only thing they did was trust and obey God. Therefore, the glory of victory belongs to God and God alone.\nGod’s power is most fully displayed in our weakness. Sometimes God insists that His people be reduced to utter helplessness so that they recognize that their deliverance can only be credited to His power and His power alone. This is why Paul argues in Ephesians 6:10, “Be strengthened by the Lord and by his vast strength.”\nIt is comforting that God knows the fears of His servants and how scared we can be in our circumstances. Yet, He does not ridicule us in our fears or mock us in our fragility. You see, God’s saving power moves through us when we admit that we have no power in ourselves.\nIn all of this, by God’s grace, we are brought to a place where we can say that any victory we experience is from the hand of God. Just as the hand of God saved Gideon and his army, every Christian has experienced the same grace in Jesus Christ. Did you clean yourself up before God saved you? Or did God save you while you were still dead in your sins, weak and inadequate? We have no chance for victory over sin apart from Christ. Praise be to God that He is our strength, and that His power has been made known in our weakness.\nWritten by Matt Capps \n\n                ",

Why? Because we were never designed to be self-determining,autonomous creatures. We were made for God, for His glory. As Augustine declared, “Our hearts are restless, Lord, until they find their rest in you.”\nWhen we’ve been allowed to go our own way and face the consequences of this judgment, we also tend to misunderstand the consequences. We tend to think of oppression in terms of what the oppressor is doing, or how we are suffering, but fail to account for what God is doing: God is always acting. Do we notice when God chastises us? Do we notice that His chastisements are designed to bring us back to Him?\nGod sent the Midianites like locusts to afflict rebellious Israel. Judgment also came in the form of cowardice and fear—Israel lost heart. When Israel finally called out to the Lord, His response addressed both of these. First, remember the God who brought you out of Egypt. He is the God who sends locusts in judgment on those who forget Him and His word. Second, do not fear. If we turn to Him, we will find a sure deliverer, for He is our salvation.\nWhy had they fallen prey to Midian and Amalek? Why had they given into fear? Because they had all decided to rely on themselves. “Each man did what was right in his own eyes” (Judges 17:6). Each man did it his own way. What this ultimately amounted to is that each man forgot God. God put it simply: “You did not obey me” (Judges 6:10).\nWhen God called Gideon, it was immediately apparent that God was doing more than raising up a strong man to lead His people to victory. Gideon was nothing like the deliverer Israel expected. The first time we encounter this “valiant warrior,” he is hiding from his enemy. As the youngest son of the weakest family in the lowliest tribe of Israel, Gideon cowers when God says, “Go in the strength you have” (v. 14). When he does act “bravely,” he only does so under cover of darkness, because he was afraid of his own family.\nHow could this man deliver Israel? How could this man be a hero? The answer is simple: God was with him (v. 16). Like Jacob’s “victory” wrestling the Lord at Peniel (Genesis 32), Gideon would not win by his own might. But God’s power is made perfect in our weakness, and He confounds the might and the wisdom of the world. To give up everything to God is to win everything; to yield to Him is victory. \nThe story of Gideon isn’t actually about Gideon. It isn’t chiefly about his doubting or his bravery. It is about God, who alone is victory. He is the one who builds the house. All the bold individuals who seek to build on their own labor in vain. \nMay God be gracious and keep us from having our own way. May He triumph in our weakness, and may He receive all the glory, for He alone is our deliverer.\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

And there’s only about four to six feet between our heads and our feet. But it takes so long for obedience to go that distance! Too often I understand God’s commands and priorities in my head, but I fail to feel their importance. I may know what God has spoken, but I’m slow to put it into practice.  \nSometimes this is a problem with the way I think about leadership too. I can wrongly think that the person who is the most articulate—the one who seems to hear God’s voice most clearly—is a great leader. But true leadership doesn’t just hear and speak; it puts words and faith into action (James 2:14–26). Barak didn’t have any issues with understanding God’s command to deploy Israel’s troops. He and Deborah both heard God speak (Judges 4:6). But what held Barak back from true leadership was his lack of courage. He wasn’t brave enough to act.\nI have sympathy for Barak. It’s hard to step out in faith when circumstances are stacked against us. From a merely human perspective, Barak’s mission was doomed to failure. God told Barak to deploy his troops on Mount Tabor, but the mount was exposed, bordered only by the Kishon River basin, which was dried up most of the year. If he’d deployed his army there, Sisera’s chariots could easily surround them and cut off their escape. This was a suicide mission. No wonder Barak found God’s command so hard to obey! But despite the odds, Deborah and Jael boldly trusted God. Their courageous leadership succeeded where Barak’s petered out (v.9). \nDeborah boldly summoned Barak. She reminded him of God’s promise of victory. And when he continued to cower, she bravely went into battle with him (vv.6–10). God honored her faith and fought for the Israelites. From chapter 5, we learn that the Lord poured down rain, causing flash floods that trapped the enemy chariots (5:4). As a result, God threw Sisera and all his charioteers into a panic before Barak’s assault (4:15–16). \nThen, as the enemy Sisera fled on foot, Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, offered him a place to rest. Inviting the general into her tent was a risk. Sisera had hoped to carry off Israelite women after the battle— “a girl or two for each warrior” (5:30). He could have easily taken advantage of Jael sexually before he fell asleep. But God honored Jael’s courage (and quick thinking!) by delivering Sisera’s life into her hands (4:17–22; 5:24–27).\nWhere can we find courage like Deborah’s and Jael’s? Where do we find the kind of obedient faith that is willing to go to risky, vulnerable places in obedience to God’s call? This kind of leadership only comes from looking to the invulnerable God who made Himself vulnerable for us. \nGod’s own courageous mission teaches us courageous leadership. The Father loved the world and sent the Son. The Father and the Son sent the Spirit. The Spirit forms us as His church and calls us to courageously participate in His mission to the world. Even when we languish in courage, God promises to send His Holy Spirit like abundant rain. He revives us, so that we can leave behind what hinders, step out, and boldly obey His Word (Psalm 68:9).\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

When I was young, I disobeyed my parents enough that when they revoked certain privileges or imposed other consequences, I did not consider what other, worse disciplinary action they could have taken against me. When a parent grounds his or her child for a week and revokes phone privileges for a day, the child rarely considers the discipline merciful. Why? Because children are naturally more distraught over the presence of any consequence than they are considerate of the fact that the consequence could have been ten times worse.\nIn Judges 3, we see God discipline His people, Israel, but in a merciful way. Their resulting disobedience shows that they did not fully grasp the grace of God in the work of God.\nAfter Israel disobeyed God by not killing off all of the Canaanites He’d commanded them to eliminate, God could have punished His people by wiping them off the face of the earth. He could have sent nations of Gentiles to kill and enslave them immediately. But He didn’t. Why did God handle the disobedience of Israel this way? Scripture tells us, “This was to teach the future generations of the Israelites how to fight in battle, especially those who had not fought before” (Judges 3:2).\nThroughout the entire chapter, we see Israel repeatedly disobey God despite His mercy toward them. They find themselves in compromising situations because of their disobedience. They cry out to God, and in His mercy God delivers His people with a judge. Upon their deliverance and freedom from threat, Israel recedes into its patterns of disobedience and sin. This cycle continues throughout the chapter and throughout the book of Judges. Throughout its existence, God made clear to Israel that it was to maintain its purity and its holiness, yet despite His discipline and His mercy, they pursued their wants over God’s wisdom.\nAll of us are broken in some way. Our sin separates us from God and, apart from the cross, we are enslaved by our idolatry. In Judges, we see Israel’s continued cycle of self-destruction and disobedience. It’s the same cycle we find ourselves in if we do not cling to the finished work of Jesus Christ. \nSometimes the rules and wisdom of God may seem unattractive to us. At times we may be tempted by the wooing of worldly influences and idols like Israel was. In humility, we must maintain a posture of repentance that recognizes the mercy of God present in the commands of God.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

My dad was a state trooper, and each evening he would get home just in time for us to eat together. He sat at the end of the table and kept us entertained with stories about his childhood, friends, and work. I heard some of those stories dozens of times, and now I tell them to my children at our table. He died before two of my children were born, and I want them to feel like they know him. I don’t want the memories to die, so I keep telling the stories.\nJudges narrates the sad tragedy of a people who forgot their story, and highlights the unfaithfulness of Israel in the face of God’s unfailing faithfulness. Their fathers saw God part the Red Sea and drown Pharaoh’s army. Their fathers could tell stories of God providing bread from heaven and leading them through the desert with a cloud during the day and a pillar of fire by night. They had also heard of the consequences of not believing God’s promises and walking in obedience. This generation was the first to enter the land of promise because their fathers did not believe God could lead them there.\nThe victories God gave Joshua should be fresh in their minds. How could they forget the walls of Jericho crashing down? They were there the day the sun stood still, but they broke covenant with God and made agreements with the inhabitants of the land. They believed they were better served and protected by doing what God forbade than by doing what He commanded. More than anything, their actions showed they failed to trust the promises of God, even though they had seen ample evidence that He would always provide and protect them.\nWhen we remember how God has kept His promises in the past, it fuels our current faith and obedience. This is the point Moses made to the Israelites, to not “forget the things your eyes have seen” (Deuteronomy 4:9). Forgetting what God had done to deliver them would lead to present unfaithfulness in heart and life. Telling these stories of God’s faithfulness, providential care, and miraculous deliverance would burn them into the hearts of their children and keep them fresh in their own hearts.\nOn this side of the cross, we have the benefit of seeing the big picture of God’s redemptive story. We read about the Exodus and know that God’s people will one day be rescued by a better Deliverer than Moses, and from a deeper slavery than physical captivity in Egypt. Our deliverance through Jesus Christ is more miraculous than the Passover, and the great reward of eternity with Him is the best promised land imaginable. May we continue to tell this great story of God’s salvation to our children, our friends, and our neighbors, because we want them to know it well, and because we never want to stop remembering it ourselves.\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When I was young, stories were simple. There were good guys and bad guys, and everyone could be divided into one of those two groups. I grew up thinking the key players in the book of Judges were the good guys. You have Gideon putting out the fleece as an act of heroic faith. You have Samson with his unmatched strength pulling down a pagan temple with his own two hands. You have the left-handed Ehud getting the drop on the evil King Eglon.\nAs an adult, I find myself shifting uncomfortably in my chair as I read back through these stories that once seemed so simple. The book of Judges is complicated. The people I once took as the heroes of the story look less like role models the older I get. In fact, sometimes the people I once assumed were the good guys now seem downright villainous. That’s because they often are.\nIn Judges, Israel experiences a downward spiral of rebellion and rescue with each new judge. We witness their fall from obedience into desolation. We long for the seed of hope that rises from the books (like Ruth and 1 Samuel) that follow to take root. But this book does not resolve. It just ends with everyone doing whatever seems right to them. It ends with people needing God to intervene—for the righteous to cry out and for the Lord to hear them and rescue them from all their troubles (Psalm 34:17).\nIt wasn’t supposed to go this way. Before the people of Israel entered the promised land, the Lord warned them not to embrace the religion of the Canaanites: “When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not imitate the detestable customs of those nations” (Deuteronomy 18:9).\nBut the book of Judges shows us that this is exactly what they did. They embraced the Canaanite religion in spite of God’s warning. This rejection of God led to some of the most catastrophic and sad stories in Scripture. \nJudges is not a collection of heroic tales. It is a tragedy, in both the literal and literary senses of the word. Judges recounts the true and tragic unraveling of the people of Israel as they chose to abandon God and live like their pagan neighbors. Like Macbeth or The Great Gatsby, Judges is told as a tragedy, where the arc of the story lands with a thud rather than a victory parade.\nGod is the hero of Scripture, and Judges demonstrates this in a pronounced way. I draw hope from the fact that God works through broken, morally compromised, deeply flawed people to bring about His perfect will. I draw hope because that perfect will is ultimately fulfilled in the finished work of our perfect Savior, Jesus Christ, who is also our righteous Judge. And His story does not end in ruin, but in peace and glory forever.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

(Social media Luddites will remember that big yellow book that arrived every year on the front porch.)\nIf we are honest, we are tempted to skip over the lists of names in the Bible because we struggle to recognize their importance. Yet, there are many reasons why God deemed it necessary to include those lists in His Word for our good. One is the fact that they tell a crucial part of the redemptive history. This is seen most clearly in the way the book of Ruth comes to an end.\nIn the verse immediately before the genealogy, we read that the people rejoiced at the birth of Ruth and Boaz’s son, saying, “‘Naomi has a son!’ And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David” (Ruth 4:17). \nNaomi’s sorrow had been taken away by the faithfulness of God. This woman who had returned home without her husband or sons, with one daughter-in-law and no hope of having anymore children, had her bitterness of soul taken away through God raising up Boaz to marry Ruth and give her a child. Ruth’s blessing was Naomi’s joy.\nBut the narrative would not be complete without the genealogy. The end of this book leaves the story of Naomi and Ruth pressing forward into the redemptive metanarrative (i.e. the overarching story) of Scripture. Ruth would be the mother of Obed and the grandmother of King David. \nThe triumph of Ruth is not merely found in the fact that she received a husband and son. The triumph of Ruth is that God’s grace would place her in the line of the Redeemer. God’s grace is so great that He can take a Gentile widow (who had no claim to the covenant promises) and make her an important figure in the history of redemption. \nRuth is one of five women in Jesus’ genealogy (Matthew 1:2-16). Two of whom were prostitutes, one was a pagan, one was an adulterer, and one was a virgin. By His grace, God wove together this beautiful tapestry of redemption, using the disreputable and despised. And this is how God continues to work today. \nEven though we are not waiting for the Redeemer to descend from one of our own children, we, who have received Jesus Christ by faith, have received the same grace as Ruth. Our names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life. It is grace—sheer undeserved and unmerited grace-—that makes the tapestry of God’s redeeming work so glorious.\nGod takes the most unworthy people and makes them to sit before Him as princes and princesses. He did it for Ruth, and He continues to do it for all who trust in the Son of Ruth—Jesus Christ. \nWritten By Nick Batzig \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Becoming a father was an eye-opening experience for me. I was young, immature, and unwise. I could barely eat a bowl of cereal without spilling milk down my shirt, and I was supposed to feed a child? Then God gave us a second little one. Good grief! Let’s just say that I was confused about God’s plan for me.\nI’d like to say I’m a perfect Instagram parent who is always smiling with my perfect, smiling kids. But the Lord knows that’s the farthest thing from the truth. It’s often a struggle. But as my daughters have gotten older, God has taught me that children are a great blessing, and that I need to rely on Him to have even a remote chance of leading and loving them well.\nBoaz and Ruth were older when they had Obed, so Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi was even older! She was bitter, and afraid she’d have no child to redeem her family. She was dying for a child to redeem her distress. \nNot only did God give her a long-awaited baby through Boaz and Ruth, He gave her a baby who would “sustain her in her old age” (Ruth 4:15). Obed was a blessing far beyond Naomi’s wildest dreams. His birth taught her that God surely would provide, even when everything looked hopeless. This baby would serve to change her heart toward God.\nAs the Bible goes on, we see that Obed wasn’t merely a redeemer for Naomi; he was another child in the line leading to the One who is called “a Savior, who is Christ the Lord” (Luke 2:11). Obed’s birth led to the birth of the world’s Redeemer—the One who would give us new birth (John 3:3).\nIt’s tempting to look back at Naomi’s situation and scold her for being impatient or for doubting God’s faithfulness. But we all do it, everyday, when we choose lesser gods over Him. Our lack of faithfulness reflects our doubt that God’s Word is faithful and true. As a parent, I’m constantly overlooking God’s grace to me through my children. When they disobey or drive me up the wall, it pushes me to rely on God a little more. And I love God more today than I did three years ago because of what He has taught me through my girls.\nThough our children are blessings, they aren’t the true and better blessing of Jesus, the Child sent into the world to redeem it. “Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the sons born in one’s youth,” says Psalm 127:4. I hope that, despite my doubting in God’s faithfulness to me, I’m able to launch my daughters into the world like gospel-lit arrows, always remembering that it is God’s Son who determines their path.\nWritten By Brandon D.

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Where in your life are you thinking about giving up? You’re looking at a situation that once seemed filled with promise, but now you just can’t see how anything good could come of it. And you’re tempted to kill your hope, to take your lumps and move on. Don’t do it. There’s so much you cannot see.\nToday’s text reminds us that there is always more going on than we can know, and because there is, there is always room for hope.\nI am not a poker player, but we’ve all seen movies or read stories about a perfectly played poker hand. Sometimes the hand wins because of the cards, but most of the time it’s because of the way the cards are played. Today’s text, which describes an ancient custom of claiming inheritances, reads like a perfectly played hand.\nThe player? Boaz. The stakes? Ruth’s future. Read the text and let me describe the custom.\nThe city gate was essentially the town hall. Boaz goes to the gate to look for Elimelech’s next of kin, Ruth’s “redeemer.” Boaz arrives with a strategy. He finds Elimelech’s next of kin and invites him to sit down with him. The man knows this gesture means Boaz wants to talk business. Boaz then gathers ten elders—respected men in the town—to serve as witnesses to this conversation.\nBoaz starts laying out his plan by saying nothing about Ruth. He just talks about Elimelech’s land. “You’re first in line. Do you want to buy it?” Then Boaz shows one of his cards. “I will gladly redeem it if you don’t want to.”\nNow, the next of kin knows he would have to take on caring for Naomi, Elimelech’s widow, if he buys the land. But since Naomi is past childbearing years, he wouldn’t have to divide his inheritance with any children he might have with her. So he says yes, thinking the land will go to his existing heirs.\nThen Boaz plays the rest of his hand: If the next of kin buys the land, he will also “inherit” Ruth, in order to give her dead husband an heir. For the next of kin to take Ruth into his home, he would have to deplete his own children’s inheritance to buy this land, knowing it would not be passed down to his own sons, but to Ruth’s.\nBoaz has painted the next of kin into a corner where the only way out is to deal honestly with what he really wants. If the redeemer doesn’t want to pay the cost and be bound to the custom of the law to give Ruth a son, this is his chance to decline. And because the elders of the city are listening, Boaz has put the man in a position where he must give his answer on the spot. And the answer he gives will be final.\nIt’s a brilliant play. Boaz has Ruth’s well-being in mind. If the next of kin really wants to do for Ruth what Boaz wants to do for her, Boaz seems willing to call that good. But if there is any hint of reluctance in the next of kin, Boaz has already offered himself as an easy out for the man. Either way, Ruth will end up with a man who truly wants her.\nThe next of kin doesn’t want to absorb the cost of buying land that will not go to his heirs, so he declines in front of everyone, and names Boaz as Ruth’s kinsman-redeemer. Boaz takes the man’s sandal with his heart set on marrying the girl.\nBack at the hut, Ruth knows none of this. What if she’s killing the hope in her heart while all this is going on? That would be a shame, wouldn’t it? Boaz was doing “above and beyond all that she could ask or think” (Ephesians 3:20). The elders who witnessed Boaz’s commitment proclaimed, “May you be renowned in Bethlehem!” (Ruth 4:11). Little did any of them know how true that statement was.\nThis is how God works in us, through us, and for us. How much is God doing in your life that you can’t see? It’s a trick question. How could you possibly know?\nWhere are you thinking about abandoning hope? Don’t do it. There’s so much you don’t know.\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Naomi gave Ruth a mother-in-lawly piece of advice: Wait. See what happens. \nAnd I bet Ruth gave a subtle eye roll, for not a one of us likes to wait, no not one. But Ruth was obedient and her story continued its winding path, one that later led to the newborn cry of a baby grandson who would grow to be the king who chased hard after God’s heart. There was no way Ruth could’ve known that back there among the barley bundles. She had to wait. \nI once heard the writer Barry Lopez use the phrase “the insouciance of cows.” I’m not a big fan of fancy words. But I like Lopez, and furthermore I like his writing, so I looked up that five-dollar jobber. Insouciance means “a relaxed and calm state”—a feeling of not worrying about anything.\nMy grandfather had a dairy farm in North Texas, so my brother and I spent growing-up summers around cows. We soon learned that these creatures are not in a hurry about anything, ever, at all. It would seem they’re fine to wait indefinitely, much to the consternation (fancy word, sorry) of my grandfather, who was always behind on something, and therefore always trying to hurry things up. But as he experienced on a daily basis, there is an earthly reality known as “the insouciance of cows” and all the cussing, stomping, fist-shaking, and spitting in the world won’t change that.\nWhat if you heard me use the phrase “the insouciance of Jesus”? Knowing what you know now (because I’ve told you) about the word, would that ring true with your image of the Jesus of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? The Jesus of the living and the dead?\nJesus didn’t walk this good earth not caring about anything, but rather not worrying about anything. And this is a crucially important distinction. There was a characteristic of restraint in Him that, far from being burdensome, was incredibly liberating. \nJesus waited on God the Father for direction at every turn. He only did what He saw the Father doing, and only said what He heard the Father saying (John 5:19). Jesus’ restraint demonstrated obedience far beyond mere lip service to the Father—the Father who spoke at every turn, Don’t worry. Trust me. The resulting picture we have is that of the Son of God relaxed and calm; in a word, insouciant.\nI’m not sure the insouciance of cows has anything to do with the state known as wonder. I suppose it’s possible, but I’m not certain. But I do believe the insouciance of Jesus was filled with anticipation, this braced-on-the-edge-of-his-sandals excitement for what God was going to do. \nRuth had to live in this posture of waiting as well, wondering what in this world was going to happen next. And so do we. And to this, God still seems to always respond with this rather parental advice: Wait. See what happens.\nSo we wait.\nThe daily, visible practice the discipline of wonder-working-waitingness is maybe at least one way the watching world can spot an obedient Christian. And trust me, they’re still watching.\nWritten By John Blase \n\n                ",

I’m trying to think of the last time I asked someone to take me under their wing. \nOne of my black pastor friends has agreed to partner with the church I serve so our churches can do ministry together in our city. I always ask to meet him at restaurants he’s familiar with, but are off my radar. So we eat together in places I might never otherwise go. I start going to them myself after awhile. One of the effects of being taken under my friend’s wing is that I begin to feel like an insider. \nIn today’s text, Ruth’s mother-in-law, Naomi, wants to put Ruth under someone’s protective wing – someone who can give her a place among Israel’s people. Naomi says, “My dear daughter, isn’t it about time I arranged a good home for you so you can have a happy life?” (Ruth 3:1 MSG). Go get cleaned up. Put on your best dress and some perfume. Be at the right place and the right time. Signal your availability for marriage. Let’s get you married! \nNaomi’s plan might not work for you, but it was a perfect plan for Ruth. It was exactly what she needed right then and there. She was ready. She just needed a push, a mentor. \nWhat she really needed and wanted was a protecting wing — a true Redeemer. Husbands are imperfect redeemers. Wives are too. But they’re both a picture of one. They’re what we might call a type of redeemer, but they can’t fully bear the weight of what a perfect Redeemer is meant to be: someone who can give us eternal belonging. Still, they point us in that direction. \nRuth needed the Protecting Wing, the Redeemer, the Perfect Captain. And she had the courage and tenacity to put herself out there and actually ask for it. She didn’t pull back. She risked it all, and went for it. And she found in Boaz a man who could take her from standing on the outside, to a place of belonging. \nBut what God was doing through Ruth was even greater than what Boaz did for her. God was making her an eternal insider in the story our of Redemption. What God did—by working through Naomi to join Ruth and Boaz—didn’t just lead to Ruth’s redemption. It formed a link in the lineage of Christ Himself, who would bring us under God’s protective wing, making us insiders in the Kingdom of God.\nThis passage in the book of Ruth reminds us of what the gospel is: the story of outsiders being made insiders.

It’s not found in the Bible at all, though some people think it is. It’s actually an old adage popularized by Benjamin Franklin, who seemed to have been paraphrasing the Greek thinker, Aesop.\nA close examination of the Gospels reveals that Jesus never really made a distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor (those meriting or not meriting help because of their behaviors or attitudes). Jesus simply talked about the poor—no qualifiers attached. His love and care for each person in need was abundantly evident. Jesus instructed His followers to care for “the least of these” for, in so doing, they were offering worship to God (Matthew 25:40).\nThroughout redemptive history, God has consistently revealed to His people that it is important to care for the poor. Today we read of the kindness and generosity that Boaz shows to Ruth and her family, and we also see the specific charge God gives to the Israelites in Deuteronomy.\nIn Scripture, and in our daily living, we can observe two postures common to giving and charitable work. I know I’ve personally adopted one or the other at different times.\nThe first posture of giving presupposes ownership. When we give from a place of ownership and possession, we tend to think like this: “I work really hard, and I try to do the right thing; therefore, I deserve nice things. Poor people don’t work as hard as me, and they don’t make good choices. They’re lucky I choose to give from time to time.” \nThe second posture of giving looks like thanksgiving. When we give from a place of humble gratitude to God, we tend to think like this: “Man, I don’t deserve any of these nice things. God’s image rests on all humanity. That some should suffer while I thrive is a complete mystery. I get to give because God has given me these resources to steward and offer as a means of His love.”\nGod knows that giving is good for us, even though it can seem so counterintuitive and countercultural. But it’s part of His nature. \nGod helps those who cannot help themselves. He helps them precisely because they are stuck. He delights in caring for us. That has been the story from the very beginning. God chose a people not for their might or magnificence, but because of His mercy.\nWe are called to give wisely and lovingly. We are called to give caringly and compassionately. We are called to give because, in so doing, we imitate God. Somehow by giving away more and more, we become more whole. This is a mystery indeed, but as we empty our pockets, our hearts and lives are filled in ways we would have never thought possible.\nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

She is physically slight when I picture her out there, harvesting to provide for herself and Naomi. She works by the sweat of her brow.\nIt would not be hard to imagine she felt small among the workers—small, with many things to be afraid of. Will I do this work well enough for us to survive? Will I, a widow with no one to protect me, be safe among the men I must work alongside?\nBut then Ruth is noticed by her employer. He hears her story of tragedy and need. And he learns of her care for Naomi, which moves him.\nThe story does not say this, but Ruth might have felt even more fear when Boaz spoke to her. Maybe he sent for her and she had to walk over to him, worried about her future, for this was the man who held power over her hope of survival—for both her and Naomi.\nBut Boaz speaks to her tenderly. He calls her “daughter.” And then he brings her under his care. He makes sure she stays with the other women and works alongside them. He makes sure the men do not lay a hand on her. \nYou can hear and see the relief in her response to him: “Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?” (Ruth 2:10).\nBoaz responds with what can only be thought of as a blessing—a hope that probably felt like a prayer over her weary head. “May the Lord repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge” (Ruth 2:12).\nLittle Ruth, with so many reasons to fear, finds herself noticed, cared for, and protected.\nBut this story is not just about Ruth. This could be a story about little Matt. Or little Chris. Or little Jonathan. You do not have to look hard for the mercy of the gospel in this story. How often have I felt small and feared the world around me? Then, when noticed by the One who can truly provide for me, I’ve asked, “Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me?” How often have I then remembered that, because of the work of Jesus, I am under the protective wings stretched as wide as the mercy of the cross, itself. \nThanks be to the One whose “faithful love is so valuable that people take refuge in the shadow of [His] wings” (Psalm 36:7).\nWritten By Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Many things can make us bitter against God. A job loss, a failed marriage, a church split, broken relationships, the death of a loved one, illness. When we experience these, we often think God should have fixed it. He should have helped. \nHe could have saved us but He didn’t. So we become bitter. We think ill of Him and speak ill of Him. We shake our fists and curse Him under our breath, and sometimes even reach the point of rejecting Him all together.\nIn Ruth 1, we see Naomi and Ruth experiencing loss to an extreme degree. They are left with no husbands, which, in that culture, meant no security and even no identity. They were on their own, destitute and lost. So Naomi declares her new name to be Mara, which means “bitter.” For, she says, “God made me bitter. He brought me back empty” (Ruth 1:21).\nLike all good stories, though, this one has a twist. It is a twist on our understanding of “bitterness.” Mara doesn’t reject God. She doesn’t shake her fist. She responds more like what we see from Job; though God made her bitter, she did not lose her integrity, give up on following Him, or speak ill of Him. Her bitterness was one of pain and brokenness, but not one that lacked faith. She knew God was God and clung to Him regardless. We see this in her response to Ruth.\nRuth was, in many ways, a fruit of Mara’s pain. She was a reminder of loss. Yet Mara claimed her as a daughter. When Ruth sought her permission to go and find a means of livelihood, Mara blessed her on her way, saying, “Go, my daughter.” This small phrase shows both love and hope. \nMara loved Ruth and kept living life. Her bitterness did not steal her capacity for feeling, for faith, or for life. It was not the bitterness we so often picture. Such a response to suffering echoes Paul’s words in Philippians 3, where he says he “considers everything to be a loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ” (3:8). \nSuffering hurts. It brings bitterness to the soul, but that bitterness does not have to rob us of life or faith, even if it robs us of happiness. We can still love, we can still follow, we can still live.\nAnd notice one more thing. When Mara (Naomi) responded to her suffering this way, something extraordinary happened; the door was opened for Ruth to meet her redeemer, Boaz. And, through meeting Boaz, the plot was set in place for the Redeemer of the world to be born – the Redeemer of whom we say we everything is loss compared to knowing Him.\nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

Even her dear mother-in-law, Naomi, pleaded with Ruth and Orpah, “Turn back!” Why, then, did Ruth stay? She was going to a land she did not know. She was leaving everything familiar—her own land, her sister, and her family.\nNaomi’s insistence clarifies the nature of Ruth’s decision. Ruth did not follow in hopes of personal gain. Naomi told her she could offer no luxurious living, no hopes of a new husband. She offered poverty, loss, and bitterness (Ruth 1:12-13). Yet Ruth took the path of greatest resistance because she had in view gains that were more than earthly. Ruth’s famous declaration, “Your people will be my people,” was rooted in her oath, “Your God will be my God” (Ruth 1:16). \nThis was not merely a human promise to follow Naomi, but a covenant vow to serve the God of Israel. Ruth remained with Naomi because her affections were set upon Naomi’s Lord, even though her decision might mean a life of hardship. \nWhere do you set your affections? Do you look for God’s guidance only in the promises of earthly success? Do you make this world’s luxuries the measure of God’s will? Too often, our hearts are fickle, valuing Christ only when our faith serves our desires. But when tribulation or persecutions arise, do we fall away?\nGod the Gardener promises that even in the desolate places, He brings forth life. Though He leads us into the wilderness, there He will speak tenderly to us (Hosea 2:14). Indeed, in that day, even the earth shall answer, even the grain, even the wine and the oil. The desert and the parched land will be glad, and we will lie down in safety (Isaiah 35:1; Hosea 2:18). \nMay we hold fast to Christ, forsaking all worldly affections, that we may see the eternal harvest and gain those profits which will last forever.\nWritten By Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    What is your theology of suffering? You have one. We all do. We may never have thought about it, but we all have presumptions we carry regarding how to think about and deal with pain and loss.\nThe book of Ruth opens with the story of a woman named Naomi, whose heart is broken. When we meet her, she is married to Elimelech. They are living in Bethlehem with their two sons, Mahlon and Chilion, when famine strikes. Elimelech decides they should uproot and go east to Moab to survive. Out of the gate, this family is facing two huge hardships: the loss of sustenance and the loss of their home.\nThen, in Moab, Elimelech dies, leaving Naomi a widow in a foreign land. Her sons marry local Moabite women, but before a decade passes, both of her sons also die. Now she is a widow in a strange land with no sons—only two daughters-in-law who are also widows.\nNaomi’s loss looks devastating. How would you have responded to this? If that were me, I might easily be asking, “Is God involved in my life? Has He failed to be good?”\nWhen tragedy hits, we’re left to try to figure out what to do with it. This is where we all get seriously theological. If there is a God, what sort of God is He? Where is He in our pain?\nThere are really only four options. We could say:\n1. There is no God, and that’s just the nature of things. Struggle and suffering are problems we endure, try to learn from, and move past.\n2. There is a God, but He’s not involved. When we cannot understand how a Divine Being could exist in the same cosmos as our pain, we’re tempted to chalk it up to the Creator being distant, disinterested, or off doing other things.\n3. There is a God who is involved, but He’s cruel. Here, the Divine Being is like the Greek gods, doling out karma, and sometimes we’re the casualties. This god is the bad guy.\n4. There is a God who is involved, and He is good—even in the midst of our suffering, even when we don’t understand Him.\nNaomi embraced that last option, and held on for dear life. We call this faith.\nWhen God set out to tell His people their story, He included the story of Ruth—this seemingly small vignette about two single women in the midst of extreme uncertainty, dealing with crushing loss. Why do we need this story? For one reason: It shows us that God is working in small stories just as much as He is in grand, sweeping epics. \nIn the small story of Ruth, God works through loss and love, famine and harvest, foreigner lands and family, to preserve a genealogy that would lead directly to King David and Christ Himself.\nWe need this story to help us recognize that God is always doing more than we can see, even in our pain. We need to remember that one person’s story is never only about that one person. Your story is not solely about you, and neither is mine just about me. Our stories belong to God, who is always doing immeasurably more than we ask or think (Ephesians 3:20). \nTo Him be the glory as we study Ruth.\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

It’s not as if things got better after David. His children and grandchildren were mired in rebellion resulting in a divided kingdom and exile. Eventually, there was no king in Israel because of their rebellion against God.\nYou can almost imagine a Jew under the rule of Rome hearing these words of David and being torn apart on the inside, the emotions rising at the mention of David and the promise of an everlasting covenant with God. This is what the Jews longed for: a king like David to vanquish their foes and rule in righteousness. This king would set things right, and God’s people would no longer be under the thumb of pagans. \nBut this was not the reality. For hundreds of years there had been rumors of a coming king, but he had not come. The hope of this everlasting covenant must have felt unfulfillable, exhausting the souls of all who set their hearts on it. It must’ve been hard to believe a so-called Messiah would ever come. What with Roman guards everywhere and the capitulation of the religious leaders, how could anyone sustain the hope necessary to read “everlasting covenant” with any kind of resolve?\nAfter all, a covenant is understood to be an oath involving two parties. Promises are made and they are binding. So you can see how it seems as if one of two things has happened: God is either holding out His favor till Israel gets their act together, or He has given up on Israel, making His promise empty.\nThis may sound familiar. Oftentimes things start going badly for us, and we believe either one of those things. Either God is sitting up in heaven tapping His foot, waiting for us to straighten up, or He’s altogether given up on us.\nHow do we know neither is true?\nBecause of Jesus. Just as Jesus was the fulfillment of God’s promise of an everlasting covenant over the house of David, He is the guarantee of God’s promises to be God to us. Even when life is hard. Even when it’s hard because of our own sin. We have a sure hope in this everlasting covenant because Jesus has fulfilled our covenant obligations—the ones we could never keep—and paid the penalty we deserved for our covenant-breaking. \nBecause of what Jesus, the Son of David, has done for us, we can enjoy the promise of everlasting fellowship with God.\nWritten by Matthew B.

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The Christian life is bound up in the use of personal pronouns. Martin Luther made that important point when he wrote, “Read with great emphasis the words ‘for me;’ accustom yourself to apply these to yourself with certain faith.” Luther was reflecting on the words of the Apostle Paul in Galatians 2:20; however, the same could be said of so many of the inspired songs written by David. “The sweet psalmist of Israel” (2 Samuel 23:1) claimed the promises and provisions of God by regarding the God of Israel as his God and Redeemer. \n\nHaving returned from battles in which he was victorious over the enemies of the Lord, David penned a great song of deliverance and thanksgiving to Him. At the opening of this song, David expressed his trust in the Lord by linking a series of personal pronouns to a series of truths about God:\nThe Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer,\nmy God, my rock where I seek refuge.\nMy shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold, my refuge,\nand my Savior, you save me from violence.\nI called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise,\nand I was saved from my enemies (2 Samuel 22:2-4).\nDavid was not suggesting he had personally done anything to gain the victory. Instead he was stating the great work of God on behalf of His people when they are in great distress. \nAs believers, we often find ourselves in great distress. In verses 5-7 of his Song of Thanksgiving, David reveals the deep distress he had felt in his own soul. There are times when we as believers feel as though we’re on the brink of death and destruction. It is then that we cry out to God for deliverance, confident that the One in whom we trust will hear and answer, according to His perfect will and timing. \nDavid also sings of God’s mighty power, the natural world serving as a platform for understanding the power of the Creator in the spiritual realm. Borrowing imagery from God’s creation, David likened God’s power to the earth reeling and rocking (v.8), His thundering from heaven (v.14). In the same way, David sang of God’s deliverance in terms of imagery from the natural world: “He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he pulled me out of deep water” (v.17). This is the language of death and resurrection. \nDavid was a great king, but Jesus Christ is our truer, better King of kings. \nBecause of Jesus’ victory over death and Satan, we too, have been “pulled out of deep water.” Because of Jesus, we can claim God as the Great Deliverer of our souls. In this way, David’s song becomes our song. May it be yours today.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    King David was far from perfect, and he would’ve been the first to admit it. Just read a few of the psalms and you’ll get an intimate look at David’s nearly constant cycle of shortcoming and contrition. Perhaps this is what makes his psalms so compelling; we see David in the depths of his broken humanity crying out for the embrace of a completely loving and restoring God. \nWhen we appropriately acknowledge the complexities of David’s character, we are able to say that while not all of his choices as king were flawless, he was still “a man after God’s own heart” (1 Samuel 13:14). In light of that, I want to draw our attention to two moments in today’s narrative that really demonstrate David’s closeness to God, and his sensitivity to the Father’s heart.\nThe first, and perhaps the most powerful, is his response to the death of Absalom. We know from earlier in Samuel’s account that Absalom was not a loyal son. His intentions to wage a rebellion and incite an insurrection were clear and known by the people as well as David. Yet David, upon hearing news of Absalom’s death, wept the tears of a distraught and deeply grieved father. He did not see an insurgent; he saw his son. David did not remember a traitor to the throne. Rather, he showed the heart of our Father, who always desires the prodigal’s return, no matter how far he has strayed or wandered. \nThe second moment comes when David, as he is restored to power, has mercy upon his enemies. For many of us, this may be harder to comprehend than the love for one’s own son. It can be difficult to truly forgive a friend who has slighted you, but I imagine it would be nearly impossible to offer true forgiveness to someone who betrayed you and then tried to kill you. But that is exactly what we see David do throughout 2 Samuel. Truly, only a heart restored to God could extend that sort of forgiveness and reconciliation. \nIt seems to me that David had learned to emulate the heart of the Father the hard way. As an adulterer, he had to beat his breast before the throne of grace. As a murderer, he had to cry out for mercy and forgiveness. And as a wayward king, he had to lay down his pride over and over again. \nSo it is for us. \nMore often than not, we come out the other side of a shipwreck better understanding the heart of God for others, because He’s so freely extended Himself to us. This does not mean we get to go on sinning intentionally so that “grace may abound” (Romans 6:1), but what it does mean is that God can redeem anything and everything from our past. He redeems us for our own sake, but also for the sake of those around us. \nDavid knew how to forgive because he himself had been so lavishly forgiven. He knew how to love unconditionally because he had been loved so perfectly and truly by his God. \nMy hope, my prayer for each of us today, is that we would hand over to God the things that we’ve most mucked up, the worst we’ve done, and the worst that’s been done to us. It’s in those places where we’ll find the greatest hope, and also the great opportunity to live as wounded healers and heralds of the goodness of God.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n\n                ",

For many of us, we’ll go to battle defending any criticisms we believe are undeserved—and often even those we know are deserved. But when someone says we hurt them and we respond by trying to silence them, what exactly are we defending?\nA theme that runs throughout David’s psalms is that God Himself vindicates His children (Psalms 26:1, 35:24, 43:1, 54:1). From the time David stepped into the limelight, he had people shouting him down—accusing him, condemning him, doubting him, and even trying to harm him. When this happened, he often responded in prayer, asking the Lord to vindicate him.\nWhy did he ask for this? We might think David asked the Lord to defend him because David regarded himself as innocent. But today’s passage shows David understood he owned a measure of guilt for the pain of others. \nIn the strange little story of Shimei, we see something I believe every person seeking wisdom should consider: What if the stinging rebuke of someone who has been wounded by our conduct is something the Lord means for us to hear and endure? What if there is some measure of opposition we need to receive and be humbled by? Even chastened by?\nDavid is on the run from his own son, Absalom, who wants to kill him and take the throne. When one of Saul’s descendants, Shimei, sees David and his men traveling along the road, he follows them on a ridge, rebuking David for all the bloodshed that has come upon the house of Saul. David is vulnerable and Shimei hopes the king will reap the whirlwind of his warring ways.\nDavid’s men offer to squash Shimei like a bug, but David’s response is uncommonly humble. He says, in effect, “What if this man’s pain is exactly what the Lord wants me to hear? Let him curse me. If the Lord told him to do this, I won’t silence him. Maybe the Lord will see this and heal us both.”\nThe story ends with David and his men stopping to rest, exhausted by their journey, by Absalom’s threats, and by Shimei’s constant rebuke. David knows he has contributed plenty to the pain in his family and nation. There are too many messes to clean up. There is too much blood on his hands to claim innocence. All he can do is rest in the hope that the Lord will show him mercy. And maybe part of that mercy comes by hearing the complaint of a man whose family he has hurt.\nI’m not advocating enabling abuse. Neither does today’s text. What it does do is raise the question: Is it possible to feel completely in the right, and not be aware of—or open to—the possibility that, somewhere along the way, our actions might have caused someone real pain?\nThe humble response is to say, “Lord, give me ears to hear the pain I have caused, even as I ask you to show mercy to the pain I’m in.” If ever there was a sinner’s prayer, this is it.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

It’s a TV drama about a group of special officers trained primarily to psychoanalyze the motives of a murderer they’ve never met, using only clues and evidence from the murders. The show fascinated me mostly because in my mind, murder is one of the most senseless crimes one can commit. I cannot fathom or understand doing such a thing.\nThe oddest part of my fascination with the show—and why I stopped watching it—is that it became entertaining to think about the motives and actions involved in murder. Murder became something to keep me entertained and even frightened on some level, but never something that led me to consider the weight of sin and the stench of death.\nIn our passage today, we see the raw results of murder and death. This account isn’t primarily about the entertainment factor of understanding why a murder took place; rather, it’s an account of the ripple effect of death. Death doesn’t just shut the deceased out from the world; it shuts out the world from the deceased. No one in close contact with the departed walks away unscathed.\nThe effects of sin and death touch us all. Murder is heinous, but we’re all guilty of countless sins that bring physical and spiritual death into the world. And our sin doesn’t merely affect us—it affects everything we touch and everyone we come in contact with, at varying levels.\nAnd yet, the grace and reconciliation we see in this passage are a beautiful picture of the way God pardons and reconciles sinners who’ve been complicit in the sin and death that plagues creation. We deserve an eternal death sentence, and yet our King Jesus pardons us, giving us numerous chances at reconciling with Him and with others.\nDon’t let the weight of your sin crush you. Instead, seek pardon from your King. Seek His grace and mercy, and you will find it; His love and justice know no bounds. We need no other proof than the cross and resurrection, when the Father sent His own Son to be an atoning sacrifice for us all.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Everyone makes terrible decisions. We sin. We put ourselves in positions of temptation— temptation toward sexual sin, dishonesty, abuse of power or position, hypocrisy. And then we’re tempted to cover it all up. We do exactly what we know we ought not to do, just like David did. We’re no better or worse because of our different sins, anymore than one mud puddle is cleaner than another. \nWith that said, we must look at what happens after sin. We have two paths available, two choices: ruin or restoration. David chose ruin. He chose to hide and deny his sin, and then to pompously judge the unjust man from Nathan’s parable. It was a profound display of God’s mercy when Nathan declared, “You are that man!” It was the slap across the face David needed to snap him from his sin-induced stupor. It turned him from ruin to restoration.\nIn that moment, David saw that he had sinned against the Lord. Yes, he had sinned against Uriah, against Bathsheba, against Israel, against his family. But he stood guilty before God. If he’d take an entire lifetime to try to make things right—to pay penance, to work at being a better man—but had never fallen on his knees before God, crying out for mercy, David never would’ve been made right. He would have rotted from the inside out.\nThat was his turn from ruin to restoration, but restoration did not mean hugs and affirmation. It meant facing the dire consequences of his actions, without indignation or grumbling. David pleaded with God to save his child, but it was not a plea for an easier punishment or a lack of consequences. It was a plea for life, a plea on behalf of someone else. \nWhen his prayers were not granted, we see David’s true heart; he got up, cleaned up, and moved forward. He poured out his soul before God, saying, “Against you alone have I sinned,” and “Create a clean heart in me” (Psalm 51). These are the groanings of a broken man—a man who knows God’s mercy and knows God will not “extinguish the smoldering wick,” but instead will breathe that flame back into life again (Isaiah 42:3).\nRuin or restoration: those are the options after sin. The only way to find restoration is to recognize against Whom we’ve sinned and cast ourselves on His mercy. When we do, we are purged, purified, and, by Christ’s blood, made whiter than snow. Here we rediscover the joy of salvation from which sin blinded us.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When my wife and I welcomed into the world our fourth child, the hospital gave me a numbered plastic bracelet identifying me as her father. It was a symbol of joy. A second bracelet was snapped on my wrist a week later when we had to have her admitted back into the hospital because she turned orange—like a little Cheeto. Her tiny liver was still learning to keep up with its workload. \nFor something as common and treatable as jaundice, I must tell you that I felt very lonely before God during that time. That second bracelet was a symbol of the blues—“Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen… ” I have expectations for how I believe the Lord should deal with me. So do you, I’m sure. I expect Him to shelter me and those I love from hardship. I bet you do too. What do we do when those expectations are not met? \nToday’s text says that, whether or not our expectations are met, we should do the same thing: depend on God’s kindness. \nImagine how Mephibosheth must have felt—the grandson of the deposed king, crippled when his nurse tried to flee with him, now living in hiding from the new, rival king he presumed wanted him dead. Imagine how he felt about the hand he’d been dealt. Imagine how terrified he must have been when David, powerful and victorious, sent for him. Imagine his prayers as the soldiers carried him back to face the king.\nNobody knows the trouble.\nWhat Mephibosheth received from David was mercy and grace. But it was a special kind of mercy and grace. He was given a permanent seat at the king’s table like one of the king’s sons. But because he was unable to walk, never once did he come to that table without help. He spent his life being carried in the arms of another. \nThis is where my heart wanted to rebel when we had to return to the hospital with our little girl. Often we want God’s care, but on our terms. We cry out, “If you really want to restore me, let me walk on my own.” But the King says, “If you really want to be restored and have a seat at my table, let me carry you.” God does not want to give us autonomy from Him. He doesn’t heal us in such a way that we don’t need Him anymore. The desire for autonomy from God is what got us into trouble in the first place (Genesis 3:1-7).\nRestoration does not come through God making us strong enough to live without Him. His mercy causes us to lean hard on His grace with all we have and are. But it also liberates us to know that we are not dead dogs to Him, as Mephibosheth said, but we are His sons and daughters. And because we are, His healing will include even deeper levels of dependency on Him, not autonomy. \nWe cannot bring ourselves before His throne. We must be carried. But beloved, we are. By Him. Always.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

I’ve never read them. No one does. The terms and conditions are just too long. They’re filled with jargon and legal-speak—a hoop to jump through. So we jump and never think about it again. But when God gives us His contract—His covenant, His promises, His terms and conditions—we read it and hold it in our hearts.\nGod makes a covenant with David, a promise that David’s kingdom and his family will not fade into the library of Israel. David’s line will reign forever. \nPresidents of the United States serve one or two four-year terms and then fade into the background. History books are filled with stories of kings and their families who lost the throne because they were overtaken, betrayed, or their family line died out. Kingdoms are powerful, but legacies are fragile.\nGod promised that a son of David would build the temple, and that he would be on the throne forever. Solomon? Yes and no. While Solomon built God’s temple, Solomon’s temple is now a pile of dust somewhere in Jerusalem. Solomon himself died. His reign came to an end. God knew we needed the One who is greater than Solomon, the true and final answer, the ultimate deliverable from God’s promise. Jesus Christ, God’s Son, born of David’s line and in his town, will reign forever. With Christ, God’s faithful love is with us forever.\nWhen Jesus died on the cross for our sins, His reign didn’t end; He rose again from the dead, ascended to the right hand of God the Father, and He now holds the universe together with His powerful word (Hebrews 1:3). God’s faithful love is set on us, secured because Jesus set us free and forever secured our salvation by His shed blood (Revelation 1:5). \nGod’s covenant to David, as well as the the new covenant He’s made with you and me, is signed, sealed, and answered by the shed blood of Christ alone. Not us. All Him. \nThese are the terms and conditions to live by: Christ alone, grace alone, faith alone. Amen.\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Patience is a difficult virtue to cultivate, is it not? When it is difficult to wait on God, we often try to resolve our circumstances by working with our own hands. But we must remember that God works in His own time, and He is good to those who wait.\nIn 2 Samuel 3:18, God declares that He will save His people through His servant David, one of the most colorful and complex characters of the Bible. Even with all of his failures, we still know that David was a man after God’s own heart. This truth is most evident in his trusting patience with God’s plan. David knew nothing could thwart the good purposes of God.\nSo David did not take the kingship from Saul by force, nor did he seek to promote himself to the throne. When given opportunities to rid the kingdom of King Saul, David resisted the temptation (1 Samuel 24 and 26). Even when others tried to advance David’s kingship, David responded righteously and justly (2 Samuel 3:6, 27-31; 4:7,12). He waited.\nThis type of patience is firmly rooted in trusting God’s timing. Eventually, David was anointed king over Judah and Israel (2 Samuel 2,5). His reign would bring peace and blessings to God’s people. But while David was a good king, he was far from perfect.\nLike the ancient people of Israel, we often long to experience the peace and blessings experienced under the reign of a good king. Jesus is that and more: the truer and greater David. Jesus is the perfect King who rules with justice and is able to bring lasting welfare for the people. As Christians, we know the full reality of Jesus’ rule will be experienced in His second coming, when all our hopes will be met in Him. Until then, like David, we must learn to wait.\nSaint Augustine once said  “patience is the companion of wisdom,” and Paul teaches patience is fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22). Still, while it is wise to wait, doing so often seems harder than trying to do the work ourselves. But even when we cannot see God’s hand, we must trust in His promises. In our own strength, we cannot fully bring about the peace and blessing we desire, but with patience, we learn to listen to the Spirit, and then respond to our circumstances according to God’s will. \nOur King is coming, and He will save us. Until then, let us humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God until the proper time. The Lord is good to those who wait.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The story of Saul’s death and David’s actions afterward have always been hard for me to understand. As king, Saul had not only rebelled against the God he was supposed to be serving, but in his fits of jealousy, he also sought to kill David. And yet, David, upon finding out Saul had been killed by an Amalekite, turns around and kills the Amalekite—the one who’d put an end to his enemy. Then David sings a lament over Saul and Jonathan with the repeated refrain, “How the mighty have fallen,” which I can only hear now in the high and lonesome voice of country singer Margo Price.\nCertainly the Amalekite was surprised by David’s action. He probably expected to be rewarded. But what about everyone else? He couldn’t have been the only one there who wanted Saul dead. Saul was a terrible king who’d been hunting David and his men, set on killing them. \nI have to confess, I am more like the Amalekite and not very much like David. Wanting Saul dead is my gut reaction even now, reading this story for the hundredth time. I look at David and have trouble seeing his actions towards the Amalekite as anything other than capricious. \nIn his novel Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold, C.S. Lewis retells the story of Cupid and Psyche. It’s a masterful work of storytelling. The first part of the book features the mercurial manner in which the King of Glome deals with those who are against him—even his own daughters. At any moment, his fury could flare, causing blood to be spilled and fortunes to be lost. \nReading that story alongside the saga of Saul and David, I find it easy to compare their actions and become frustrated with David. Why was David so grieved by the death of Saul, who wanted him dead? Why did he lament Saul’s death and go on to avenge him?\nI think we get a clue when David repeatedly calls Saul the “LORD’s anointed” (2 Samuel 1:14). Yahweh Himself put Saul in the position to reign as king, and not even Saul’s most heinous acts could override God’s will. David’s conviction of this truth and his surrender to God’s sovereignty were stronger than his own pride and the desire to escape unscathed.\nSome things are just bigger than our own skin.\nIn Romans 12, Paul’s instruction is, “Bless those who persecute you” (v.14), and that is exactly what David did: he blessed those who had tried to kill him. It’s a trait we also see in the Son of David, Jesus. \nThere on the cross, Jesus was mocked, persecuted, and hung to die—all under the watch of our wise and sovereign God. And what did Jesus do? He blessed. Jesus had compassion on those who persecuted Him, which is a form of blessing (Luke 23:34). And to this very day, He has not stopped doing the same for us, those who have sinned against Him yet call on His name (Romans 10:13). \nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

Hidden away on the offensive line, I served as little more than a blocking sled with a pulse. The summer between my freshman and sophomore year, the linebacker I regularly had to block was pushing 350 pounds on the bench press. I was still trying to figure out a grip that would keep the bar from falling on me when I tried half that.\nI only played two years of high school football because I decided getting a job was more important than being a tackling dummy. Those two years brought me face-to-face with my own weakness. \nRecognizing our weakness is demoralizing, especially when it seems like everyone else is strong. King David, the giant-slaying man that he was, had to reckon with his own weakness, too. \nUpon arriving at Ziklag, David and his men are confronted with the tragic kidnapping of their families. 1 Samuel 30:4 says that David and his men wept “until they had no strength left to weep.” Amidst the deepest despair any of the men had ever known, they turned on their leader and considered stoning him. Left with nowhere else to turn, the text says, “David found strength in the LORD his God” (v.6).\nDavid’s hope in the strength of God must be contrasted with Saul’s hope in his own strength. David trusts God for deliverance while Saul trusts only himself. In the strength of God, David finds his deliverance. In his own strength, Saul finds his demise.\nWhen we are confronted with the darkness of our sin-scarred world, even our own friends and family may turn on us. When we feel backed into a corner because of our own failure or inescapable circumstances, we can allow our inadequacy to become our identity and we risk implosion.\nThis is the reality: we are not strong enough to overcome the brokenness of this world, but our God is. We may be the Body of Christ, but we are weak apart from the Head, who is Christ Jesus Himself.\nAs we trudge through seasons of life that feel like modern manifestations of the “valley of the shadow of death” David mentions in Psalm 23, we must rely on the guidance of the Good Shepherd. It is the strength of God in which we trust, not our own.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

It’s in the dark that we see our truest selves—who we really are when nobody’s watching. Usually, it’s in times of great stress that our private character is exposed with potentially public consequences. If you’re anything like me, this truth is difficult to admit.  \nIn 1 Samuel 28:5, Saul was under great duress as the Philistines closed in for battle. When Saul sought God for rescue, God was silent. We know God had already sealed Saul’s fate, a promise previously relayed to him through the prophet Samuel (1 Samuel 15:28).\nSaul’s true character is exposed when he secretly turns to a medium hoping for a way out. The answer Saul receives is ironic. The spirit of Samuel seems to appear in the cover of darkness to further confirm God’s previous word, the word the desperate king hoped he could to escape: Saul’s kingdom would fall.\nChristian wisdom tells us that while godly character may manifest itself in great moments, it is forged in small ones—seemingly small moments of obedience. Conversely, patterns of unrepentant rebellion will eventually lead to final judgment. Saul had long before prepared his own table (1 Samuel 2:29-30). Now he would swallow a last meal prepared by a witch. “The LORD [had] done exactly what he said” (28:16-19, 24-25). \nSaul had abandoned the way of obedience his entire life, and the Lord had stopped speaking to him. Sadly, it seems Saul was never truly repentant. But before we cast the first stone, let us again admit that we are no better than Saul. The good news is our story doesn’t have to end like this.\nWhen we are truly repentant and cry out for salvation, God is not silent. In fact, He has already spoken. On the cross, Jesus has already reaped what you have sown (Romans 6:23). He consumed the full plate of judgment that you and I deserved. Because of Christ, instead of groping in the dark like Saul, we can walk into the light—exposed, repentant, and forgiven.\nIt is often said, “As the king goes, so do the people.” Thankfully, God delivered ancient Israel from the wickedness of King Saul, who fell at the hands of the Philistines. In our case, God delivers us through the righteousness of Jesus. He is the eternal King who died at the hands of men, but rose again to set men free. His kingdom will never fall.\nBecause of the grace of Jesus Christ, we can humbly accept the warnings associated with the life of Saul. Every word of warning before the final judgment is actually a word of mercy. \nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    A few mornings ago I was having breakfast with my daughters, and it came time to pray before we headed out for our respective days. It dawned on me then that my older daughter had prayed a few days prior for confidence and focus in a performance she was part of. The performance went off without a hitch, so I brought that up as a reminder of ways in which God answers prayer and works on our behalf. It was a helpful, if small, lesson for us.\nOften this is how we think of God working: we ask and He helps. But more often than that, perpetually in fact, God is working in ways that are deeper and wider and more complex than we know. The stories of David and Abigail, and then of David and Saul, show this so clearly.\nWhen David was insulted and shamed by Nabal, he was ready to mete out vengeance. His overtures had been made with respect, his men had protected Nabal’s shepherds, and they were in need of help. So of course, he became enraged when he was not only turned away, but with insults. \nThis is where we see God intervene on behalf of David. The story says Abigail—Nabal’s wise and beautiful wife—rode to meet him, offer assistance to his men, and plead for mercy. What we should see in that is God being merciful to David by protecting him and his future kingship from his own rage. \nDavid recognized it. He saw in Abigail a wise and beautiful messenger from God sent to redirect and protect him, so he blessed the Lord and the Lord blessed them.\nA few verses later we see David fleeing from Saul. Again, an opportunity for revenge arises. David could have ended his problems in a single blow. He could have dealt with Saul the same way he intended to deal with Nabal. Instead, he showed humility and discretion. Maybe God’s intervention earlier had made a lasting impression.\nGod’s direction in David’s life was not always obvious and not always asked for, but David saw it. He saw God leading him, and he learned to trust God even through the odd and unexpected. David had the power to take vengeance, to act on his own behalf, but he learned to let God do that. The more David looked for God’s hand at work, submitted to it, and let God work, the more God led and blessed him. Do we think it should work any different for us?\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

When asked if it was hard to play the role, the actor said, “What you have to do to play guys like this, is you have to figure out what, in their minds, makes them believe they are right. Figure out what twisted sense of justice drives them, and you can get inside their heads.”\nImagine you’re King Saul today as you read these verses. Not David. Saul. What, in his mind, justifies his venom? Maybe that’s not hard for you to do. Maybe you carry the burden of failing to live up to your calling. Maybe you feel you’ve been cut out of a deal that should have paid off for you. Maybe you are at war with God in your heart because you feel He owes you something, or has withheld something, or has favored someone else instead of you. \nCandidly, I have been Saul in this passage many times—lashing out at others because there is a war in my heart against God. Can you relate?\nSaul’s commitment to kill David had become so resolute that David had to go into hiding. His mighty men went with him. There were times when Saul got close enough to David that David’s men wanted to take the fight to Saul and end it, but David wouldn’t let them. As far as David was concerned, Saul, for all his venom, was still the king the Lord anointed over Israel. Who was David to depose God’s anointed one? (1 Samuel 24:1-7).\nOn this one occasion, though, David and his men came closer to Saul than he ever could have dreamed. Saul ducked into the very cave where David and his men were hiding. David’s men wanted to kill Saul, but David forbade it. Instead, he snuck over and cut off the corner of Saul’s robe.\nWhen Saul stepped out into the daylight from the mouth of the cave he heard a familiar voice, “My Lord the King!” Saul spun around. David emerged from the darkness holding up the corner of Saul’s robe. He had spared the king, and Saul knew it (1 Samuel 24:16-22). Mercy for the bloodthirsty. David also promised to show mercy to Saul’s family when he became king. \nThe text describing this moment shows that Saul understood he had become David’s new Goliath. He knew the story was already written. He knew he would fall. And he knew that this was never really a fight against David. What must have chilled him even more was that he knew David knew this too. Saul’s fight was with the Lord. David rested in that. Saul could not.

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    One of my favorites albums from the ‘90s is Wildflowers by Tom Petty. Nearly every summer that album gets a few listens straight through. It’s a complete work—a puzzle of many parts that, when put together, create a striking picture. But there is one song I think about even when I’m not listening to the album.\nWhen Petty sings, “It’s Hard to Find a Friend,” I cannot help but think how true a statement it really is. I think about my kids, my oldest daughter in particular, who has struggled to make and keep friends because of her disability. Whenever I see people who look or sound lonely, I think of that song, of that line. It’s truly one of those lyrics that rings in my head even when I haven’t listened to the album for a long time. \nThe longing for friendship is so innate, so obvious, that I am struck by anyone who seems content in their loneliness. It makes no sense to me because I really feel the longing for deep friendship in my own life, even to the point of pain.\nThe story of David and Jonathan is rightly told as a story of deep and meaningful friendship. David is a friend to Jonathan, despite Jonathan’s father, Saul, trying to kill David. Jonathan pledges his friendship to David, even though his commitment is an act of treason against his  father, the king. This is a costly friendship, and I believe God wants us to see the beauty in it.\nBut I think we make a mistake when we read this story and walk away trying to be a friend like these men. I think this story is best read as a way to whet our appetites for true friendship. And not just any friendship. We all long for a friend who will love us and stand by us, even if it might cost them something—convenience, time, or in the case of David and Jonathan, reputation and even life. \nIn Matthew 11:19, Jesus is called a friend of “tax collectors and sinners,” and it’s not meant as a compliment. The people Jesus befriended tarnished His reputation among the religious leaders of the day, but He didn’t care; those were the people He’d come to care for. Jesus knew those were the ones most likely to come to a place where they found they needed someone. He came to meet that need, ultimately, at the cost of His own life.\nYou see, the story of David and Jonathan’s friendship is read best when it points us to our own longing for the costly and beautiful friendship of Jesus with sinners like us. His friendship is the deepest imaginable, the most loyal. He is the friend who sticks closer than a brother, who chose us and gave His life for us (Proverbs 18:24; John 15:16-17). \nThere is nothing we can do to lose Christ’s friendship. This is good news for all of us who find it “hard to find a friend.”\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

Where are the flashlights? Do we even have flashlights? How long is this going to last? I hope the kids don’t wake up. Man, it’s getting hot in here already. \nDarkness has a way of making us feel cornered, alone, unsure. Light is much safer. We gather information in the light, see our surroundings, and act accordingly. There’s also power and comfort in knowing you aren’t alone—especially in knowing the Lord is with you.\nDavid’s life is filled with high watermarks of walking by faith, living with a behind-the-scenes awareness that the Lord is with him. As David led Israel’s military to defeat impressive battalions from other nations, the Lord was with him. And when Saul hurled spears at David’s head, God was with him then, too. \nSaul wasn’t exactly a scrub. It’s not like David had more raw talent and ability than Saul. Remember, the people elected Saul because of his impressiveness. But Saul lost a step. He lost his edge. David, on the other hand, “Continued to be successful in all his activities because the LORD was with him” (1 Samuel 18:14). \nSo why did Saul’s sparkle fade while David became a mega-watt star to the people? Scripture tells us, “The LORD was with David but had left Saul” (1 Samuel 18:12). When Saul pursued his own ways, contradicting the ways of God, the Lord removed His blessing, and put it on His faithful servant David—the lion-killing, giant-slaying, shepherd from Bethlehem.\nWho are we in this story—Saul or David? We’d like to think we are more like David: rugged, handsome, faithful. Sadly, in our own strength, we’re a lot like Saul. We are unfaithful. We pursue our own ways. \nBut if we are in Christ, we don’t have worry about God departing from us (Deuteronomy 31:8; Romans 8:31-39). The faithful Shepherd-King from Bethlehem—God’s own Son—died for our faithlessness, our sin, our high treason against God. And then He rose from the grave, forever forgiving and uniting us to Himself, welcoming us into His kingdom. \nHe will never leave us. He promises, “I am with you always, to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:20). No matter the darkness you face, the Lord is empowering you to be faithful to Him today. The Lord is with you. Always.\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I got into a few fights in middle school, but the time I duked it out with a teammate on the football team—who was about 100 pounds heavier than me—is the most memorable. Not because I won the fight handily; it didn’t go so well for me. Rather, it was memorable because I stood up to him in front of a large group of people, and I earned his respect and the respect of my peers. I was David fighting Goliath, with a whole nation watching.\nThe difference, of course, is that David clearly won his battle with Goliath. He wasn’t merely respected or revered because he had the guts to fight a giant; he was exalted because he defeated a national foe and stood his ground for an entire nation.\nSunday school lessons often teach us that there are many “Goliaths” in our lives, and we just need to trust in God for the strength to slay them. On this thinking, if I’d prayed a little more, maybe I would’ve toppled the Goliath on my middle school football team! It is true that we face all sorts of opposition in life that we cannot defeat on our own, but fighting the inconveniences and hateful people in our lives isn’t the point of the David and Goliath story.\nAs Ephesians 6:12-14 tells us, our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual oppression. And there is no amount of stones we can throw at the Goliath of personal sin and demonic oppression threatening our eternal existence.\nThe true David, Jesus Christ, has slain the spiritual Goliath of sin and death on our behalf. Like David, He walked onto the battlefield as a humble Shepherd and walked away a victorious King. Though His beaten and bloodied body on the cross may have looked like the King was slain, the cross was actually His weapon of a choice, a stone thrown right between the eyes of sin and death’s mocking face.\nMay we not try to topple the Goliaths in our lives, but rather look to the One who’s already done everything to win the war. Our King stands victorious, and His victory is also ours. May we worship Him.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The morning of June 1, 2013, finally arrived after a long, soggy night. By the grace of God, the river rushing down the road in front of my parents’ house disappeared, but it took our sleep with it. I don’t know how much rain fell between our rehearsal dinner and the morning of our wedding, but it was enough to flood my parents’ basement, my future mother-in-law’s house, and two friends’ cars.\nFew wedding attendees knew we were running on virtually no sleep, for the joy of a long-awaited wedding is enough to cover even a week of sleepless nights and sopping basements. But Susie and I knew. We knew that, as merry as our wedding may be, our sleeplessness would threaten whatever energy our adrenaline could create. How we looked on the outside was the opposite of how we felt on the inside.\nHow exhausting it would be to live in such a state every day before the all-knowing God of the universe. As we read in 1 Samuel 15, God rejected Saul as king of Israel because he tried to please people instead of God. After this, the Lord instructs His prophet Samuel to make the trek to Bethlehem where he would find the one God had chosen to replace Saul as king.\nSamuel initially mistakes the chosen one as the firstborn son, Eliab, but the Lord reminds him in 1 Samuel 16:7, “Humans do not see what the LORD sees, for humans see what is visible, but the LORD sees the heart.”\nGod and people see reality differently. Even a prophet of God like Samuel cannot discern the heart of a man and his fitness for king. \nThe fundamental flaw in our human perspective is that we can only see what is visible, while God can see that which is invisible: the heart. The temptation, then, in our effort to impress others, is to put on a show—to prove to others that we have it all together. But God is not fooled by our foolishness.\nThe light of God’s wisdom pierces the darkness of our outward performance to illuminate the depths of our inward being. No amount of spiritual showboating, good looks, cool toys, or theological knowledge is more important than a heart that’s more interested in pleasing God than man. \nDavid, the one who would be selected by God as king over His chosen people, wasn’t even present when the sons of Jesse paraded in front of Samuel. He was tending to his sheep, without hope of great renown or riches.\nOur God is not interested in spiritual performances, whether inspired by the life of Jesus or aimed to please others. Instead, the Lord desires for our hearts to be humbled, transformed by the gospel of Jesus Christ, with the intent of glorifying Him.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I seldom read the foreword in a book. More often than not they’re a hat-tip from another author extolling the virtues of the book’s author and/or its content. There’s nothing wrong with that; I’m just usually not interested. But the acknowledgments page? That’s a different story. I always read that because I love hearing about the others who helped that book come to pass—the publishing team, friends, family, children, spouses. All honest authors know a book is only birthed with a little help from their friends.\nI’ll never forget the way one author described his wife in his book’s acknowledgements. He wrote: “She is the warmth behind the light.” What a beautiful way to describe the reality that any wonder one might find in his words was due to her, “the warmth behind the light.”\nToday’s text in 1 Samuel reminds me of that phrase. There was plenty of attention-grabbing light in the army of Israel, not all of it positive by any stretch, but all of it noteworthy. The most inspiring in these chapters surrounds the gutsy actions of Jonathan and his armor bearer. Crossing a treacherously high mountain pass, and then charging up on all fours into a group of Philistine soldiers, is the stuff of which legends are made. Their bravery lit a fuse in the rest of the ranks and turned the tide of the day. But as bright as that scene is, the writer wants to ensure we know the real source of that day’s victory, the warmth behind the light. So he pens a mini-acknowledgment in verse 23 of chapter 14: \n“So the LORD saved Israel that day.”\nIn a sense, you could say most of the trouble in the Old Testament occurred when that truth was unacknowledged, when men took things into their own hands and began to believe their own press. In a sense, you could say most of the trouble that occurs in our own lives stems from a similar refusal to remember and give credit where credit is due.\nThis acknowledging does not diminish the achievements of men like Jonathan and his armor bearer, or us. But it does keep a sobriety of spirit alive, a clear-eyed humility in check that the warmth behind and within the light of our lives is the LORD. Any wonder one might find in us is only due to Him.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In 1796, George Washington gave his farewell address to the American people. This would become the first of 35 farewell addresses given by a President of the United States (the other eight who served would die in office). The farewell address gives the outgoing President the opportunity to recap his accomplishments, principles, and concern for the people. \nThis, of course, was not something unique to the American political system. The great leaders in Israel’s history also often gave farewell addresses. This is seen in Moses’ farewell speech, as Israel transitioned to the leadership of Joshua (Deuteronomy 31-33). Samuel also gave his own farewell speech, as God’s people transitioned to the leadership of King Saul (1 Samuel 12). In both of these speeches, the outgoing leader highlights the way in which he conducted himself, the work of God, and a call for the people to remain committed to God.\nThe people of God had asked for a king. The Lord had granted their request by anointing Saul. When Israel was facing the threat of the Ammonites, Saul rose to the occasion by becoming their defender and leader (1 Samuel 11:1-14). In doing so, he stepped into the role of the king, and Samuel became the last of the judges. With that transition complete, Samuel took the opportunity to address his people. \nYou see in his speech that Samuel first appeals to the way in which he has conducted himself as God’s appointed judge (1 Samuel 12:3). He explains that he has not acted with sordid gain in mind, or taken a bribe to pervert justice. He then reminds the people of the great redemptive works of the Lord throughout their history (vv. 6-18). Finally, Samuel charges the people of God with the following exhortation: “If you fear the Lord, worship and obey him, and if you don’t rebel against the Lord’s command, then both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the Lord your God… Above all, fear the Lord and worship him faithfully with all your heart; consider the great things he has done for you” (vv. 14, 24).\nSamuel reminded the people of their need for an upright leader, of the mighty work of God, and of their own responsibility to respond properly to what God had done for them. These three things find their ultimate fulfillment in Christ—the great Judge and King of the Church. \nIn His farewell discourse in the Upper Room (John 13-17), Jesus told His disciples of the way in which He led them: with His love, joy, and peace. He reminded them of the work of God in His laying down His life for them and in sending the Holy Spirit to them. And He charged them to abide in Him, to obey Him, and to love one another (John 15:1-17). This is the farewell discourse from which we, as those who’ve been redeemed by Christ, must ever turn our attention.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

One of my first recollections is of him mercilessly pursuing David and his compatriots through the wilderness, which makes a compelling backdrop for many of the psalms. But today’s reading gives us a different glimpse into the life of Saul.\nAlthough the Lord foresaw Saul’s abuse of power, He still gave Saul more than a fighting chance as a leader. Before Saul was ever proclaimed king, God sent His spirit upon him (1 Samuel 10:6,10). Imagine that: even though God knew Saul would eventually go astray, He still set Saul up for success as a king. \nThis speaks to the deep compassion our Creator has for each one of us. If God is calling you to something, He will equip you for it. Whether it’s leadership in a traditional sense, evangelism, hospitality, a position at work, or a volunteer role through your church—if God is calling you to it, He will give you the tools you need to faithfully serve Him in that call. \nNow, that doesn’t mean God will always raise you up to glory, nor does it mean God’s Spirit is with us for our own gain. Rather, as we can see in countless places throughout Scripture, God gives the opportunities, talents, and skills we need to make His name great. \nHowever, much like Saul, the moment we stop directing our passions and pursuits toward God and His glory, it’s likely He’ll raise up someone else for His eternal and divine purposes. We make a big mistake when we assume, whether consciously or subconsciously, that God needs us to restore this world to Him. Yes, He takes joy in preparing, equipping, sending, and walking with each of us, but let us never be fooled into thinking He needs us to bring forth His will or complete His plans. \nMaybe you’re in a place where you know you need a new heart. Don’t hesitate to ask God for it! His mercies are never-ending and new every morning (Lamentations 3:22-23). Maybe you need to be revived by His Spirit for the very first time. Or perhaps you want to grow in intimacy with Christ, for your relationship to be renewed. Don’t let this day go by without pausing before our Creator—the One who calls us, sends us, equips us, and has forever redeemed us. \nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

Did you read any reviews beforehand, scrolling through websites for a few hours and looking for pros and cons? \nWhen my wife gave me the green light to buy a new camera for our family, I spent hours researching cameras within our price range, reading reviews from both professionals and amateur consumers. It’s good to get input from others, especially trusted authorities in those areas. I don’t know enough about cameras to make a safe and wise decision. I need some guidance. \nIf I don’t know enough to make a purchase like that one on my own, why do I think I know enough to make decisions about my life without the Lord’s help? I know I don’t, but I still plow forward anyway, doing my thing. \nThe nation of Israel took their eyes off of the Lord and worshiped idols, bowing down to other gods instead. They thought they knew what was best for them. They had their self-prescribed wants and they thought God wasn’t meeting them, so they looked elsewhere. \n“There is a way that seems right to a person, but its end is the way to death” (Proverbs 14:12). \nSelf-generated spiritual guidance will always lead to disaster. When God’s ways are tossed to the side, we enter a spin-cycle of sin and destruction.\nIsrael came out of their dizziness, confessed their sin to the Lord, and experienced a moment of serenity in 1 Samuel 7. But did you see what happened in chapter 8? They rejected the Lord’s leadership, His authoritative review, His thoughts—the cons of choosing to follow a mere human king, versus trusting the almighty God to lead them. Israel looked around at the surrounding countries and wanted to be like them, to live like them. Every day we find ourselves looking out onto the same horizon, choosing whether to follow the rest of the world or to follow God.\nToday, the crucified and risen Lord Jesus sits on His throne, speaking to us from His Word, reminding us there is a narrow path leading to life and a wide road leading to destruction (Matthew 7:13-14). There’s the way of Calvary or the way of the world. \nWhere will you go today? Which path will you follow? \nMay we answer like our brother Peter: “Lord, to whom will we go? You have the words of eternal life. We have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God” (John 6:68–69). Who else is worth following? No one but Christ alone. \nLet’s confess our sins, knowing they’ve been forgiven through Jesus’ sacrificial death and resurrection (1 John 1:9). And let’s choose to seek Him, His Kingdom, and His ways, instead of our own. \nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n                ",

The really big blockbusters, like Raiders, would play for a year or more. And so I made countless trips to see it at the Cinema City 8 theater, complete with its Vegas-style lights illuminating the Roebuck shopping plaza.\nIt is possible I heard lessons about the ark of the covenant in Sunday school, but I don’t remember any of them before seeing that movie. Do you remember the scene where the Nazis have the ark and are having a “ceremony” to open it? Their goal was to use the power of the ark to fight the Allies. Of course, Indiana knows they are making a big mistake by opening it, so he tells Marion to look away and close her eyes when the ark is opened.\nAnd then it happens: one of the most iconic, terrifying moments in my movie-watching history. The faces of all who look at the ark melt off, the presence of God spreads, and everyone is obliterated—except for Indy and Marion, who knew better than to look at it.\nI had heard so many sermons and lessons on the holiness of God growing up in our Baptist church. But that movie is what brought this question home for me: “Who is able to stand before the Lord, this holy God?” (1 Samuel 6:20).\nThe answer, of course, is no one. When you read 1 Samuel 5 and 6, the point is clear. Not only are the Philistines going to pay for approaching the holy God in the presence of the ark, but so are God’s people. After all, Israel should know better. They should know the power of the ark and the depth of God’s holiness better than anyone.\nWho is able to stand before the Lord, this holy God?\nIt almost seems like a helpless situation. God’s holiness and power come together and no one can stand in the presence of either of those things. Our sin and lack of holiness separate us from God in such a dramatic fashion that we cannot look on Him without fear of death.\nThere is one way we can stand before the Lord, in all His holiness. Jesus, the God-man, made a way for us. He stood in our place and died the death we deserved so that we could approach our holy God with confidence (Ephesians 3:12). He took on our sin and gave us His righteousness in return, making the impossible possible. Because of Christ’s sacrifice, we can now “stand before the Lord, this holy God,” face to face (and still intact), welcomed with open arms (1 Corinthians 13:12). \nWritten by Matthew B.

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When I was a child, I learned many Bible stories in Sunday School, summer camp, and from my parents. I knew the Old Testament adventures and characters through and through. As I’ve grown older, though, I’ve realized that I almost inevitably missed the point of nearly every story and have since had to relearn them. The story of Samuel’s calling is just such a story. \nFor years I thought of this as the heartwarming story of a naïve and innocent little boy learning to obey God. It is that in part, but like most Bible stories, it’s more than a simple lesson about obedience. When Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening” (1 Samuel 3:10), he wasn’t just setting an example for all the little boys and girls. He was committing himself to God’s will and God’s plan, even though he likely didn’t know it. He was offering himself to the service of God wholeheartedly and with his whole life. \nThe news and command God gave Samuel wasn’t heartwarming. He became God’s messenger to Eli, the priest, about his certain downfall for the way his family had dishonored God. This boy, this little flannel-graph-and-illustrated-Bible boy, was the mouthpiece of God’s judgment, and he would declare God’s promises and judgments over Israel for decades hence. \nThis is a story about God’s commitment to Israel and the lengths He went to bind Himself to them. When those who were supposed to be leading the people in obedience failed, God raised up a child to be a mouthpiece of righteousness. And God acted in accordance with the prophecy He gave Samuel; Eli’s family was thrown down for their disrespect of God’s house  and His ark. They treated the first like a brothel and the second like a talisman of good luck. \nThis is no cutesy story about a little boy’s obedience; it is the origin story of a man God used to raise up His king and to lead His people in faithfulness. Samuel’s willingness to listen and to obey was more than just a good example for our Sunday School lessons; it set the course for the house of Jesse to be established. From this house came both the king God intended to rule Israel (1 Samuel 16) and the King God intended to save the world (John 3:17-18). \nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    This study of 1 and 2 Samuel focuses primarily on three people and their role in the establishment of the kingdom of Israel. Samuel was the last of the Judges; Saul was the first king of Israel; and David was the king they celebrated most.\nSo many familiar biblical stories and characters are found in these historical books; Goliath, Bathsheba, Mephibosheth, Jonathan, and Nathan the prophet are all here. But the story begins as a surprising number of biblical stories do—with a miracle birth. We see this in the Old Testament with Abraham and Sarah (Genesis 17:15-22), and Isaac and Rebekah (Genesis 25:19-26). Both couples faced apparent infertility. We also see it also in the New Testament with Zechariah and Elizabeth (Luke 1:5-25), and Joseph and Mary (Luke 1:26-38). Both conceived when it wasn’t thought possible. \nAgain and again in Scripture, hope is birthed into this world against all odds. \nEven though the books of Samuel relay the epic unfolding of a mighty kingdom, they begin small with the grief of a sorrow-filled woman who wants more than anything for the Lord to give her a child. The Lord gives her a son whose life foreshadows Christ. Hannah conceives Samuel, who leads Israel into a relationship with their king. We’re reminded in these early chapters how the story of the Lord’s work in the world, while global, is also deeply personal.\nFrom Hannah wanting a child to Israel wanting a leader, these books always keep eternity in view. Beyond the page-turning adventure of kings and battles and political gamesmanship, 1 and 2 Samuel tell the story of a greater King—the Lord God who calls His people by name and establishes His throne forever.\nLike Israel, we want to be protected and provided for. When Israel asked God for a king, what they were really asking was for God to give them someone to protect them and provide for them. The Lord had been doing this for them for centuries, but they wanted someone they could see, touch, and seat on a throne. Though their request was made in fear, the great irony of the gospel is that this is exactly what God gave us when He sent Christ to live among us—a King who would be one of us, seated on a throne that could never be defeated.\nAs you read these books, pay attention to Israel’s hunger for peace and stability. That hunger has not gone away, and no nation has ever chosen a king who could satisfy it. Only God can do this, which is not only the point of 1 and 2 Samuel, but of the Christian faith as well.\nOur King has come, and He will reign forever.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

But the house lights remain off, the stage lights have been left shining, and a few of the group’s biggest hits have mysteriously been left unplayed. As concertgoers, we know what all of this means: an encore is coming. All we have to do is stand up and applaud like wild. After a minute or two, the band will retake the stage and deliver those missing hits.\nHere at the end of Kings, God Himself is signaling for an encore of sorts. It would seem the story is over. The people of Judah, like Israel before them, have been marched out of the promised land in shame. Jerusalem’s walls have been demolished, and the temple has been destroyed. “So Judah went into exile from its land” (2 Kings 25:21).\nBut in the midst of this apparent and heart-wrenching finality, God set the stage for another act in the story of redemption. “On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah’s King Jehoiachin, in the year Evil-merodach became king of Babylon, he pardoned King Jehoiachin of Judah and released him from prison” (v.27). A king of Judah—a descendant of David—is alive and well. There is a spark of hope flickering in the darkness. The spark isn’t much, of course, but it signaled to ancient readers—and us—that God stands ready to fan it into a flame.\nReading the books of 1 and 2 Kings this side of the New Testament, we know that God did not abandon His people. He brought them back from Babylon, and He fulfilled every Old Testament promise through Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 1:20). We know that the Son of God died to conquer sin and death and that through Him, eternal life is available to any and all who believe—not just to the physical descendants of Abraham but also to people from every nation under heaven.\nWe know all this because we have the benefit of hindsight. But God is just as faithful even when we don’t have this benefit. In our current struggles and doubts, God has left us a spark of hope. Actually, He’s left us a bonfire of epic proportions. In His Word, He has promised to make all things new (Revelation 21:5), and to work all things for our good, if we have placed our trust in Him (Romans 8:28–29). Those are not promises of health, wealth, or comfort. In fact, Jesus was very clear when He promised we’d have trouble in this world (John 16:33). But we can rest in God, because He is faithful. No matter how dark things may seem, the story of redemption will not end until His children are safe at home with Him. The encore is coming, and we have yet to hear the best songs.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

You did everything you could to solve a problem, but despite your best efforts, you simply couldn’t do enough to fix what was broken. King Josiah faced such a situation, but before we get into that, we have to set the stage a bit.\nFollowing Hezekiah and his relatively righteous rule came his son and grandson, Manasseh and Amon. Both Manasseh and Amon did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord. Neither of them could come close to matching the faithfulness of Hezekiah. Manasseh committed idolatry worse than other nations around Judah, and God promised that disaster would follow Judah as a result. Then, his son Amon didn’t do much better. He also forgot God and followed in his father Manasseh’s footsteps, worshiping idols instead of Yahweh, and in the end, he was killed by his servants. Both men continued to drive Judah deeper and deeper into sinful idolatry.\nThe evil that had run amok throughout their reigns could not be undone by the succeeding king. After their catastrophic reigns came a king the likes of which Judah had not seen since David. Josiah, son of Amon, took over after his father’s death, and he ruled with more righteousness than even Hezekiah had three generations before him. Scripture tells us, “He did what was right in the Lord’s sight and walked in all the ways of his ancestor David; he did not turn to the right or the left” (2 Kings 22:2).\nThis pronouncement of Josiah’s righteousness calls to mind the requirements for a king laid out in the Mosaic Law in Deuteronomy 17 (vv.14–20). Speaking of a righteous king’s need to study and meditate on the Law, verse 20 says, “Then his heart will not be exalted above his countrymen, he will not turn from this command to the right or the left, and he and his sons will continue reigning many years in Israel.” Josiah fits that description.\nKing Josiah was righteous like King Hezekiah generations before him, though, just like his ancestor, Josiah wasn’t perfect by any means. As king, Josiah stayed on the straight and narrow path and was not distracted by idols or evil worship practices like his unfaithful predecessors. By all accounts, Josiah did everything in his power to restore Judah to Yahweh and right the wrongs that had been perpetuated for generations before him.\nBut it wasn’t enough. Not even this righteous king could repair the fractured relationship between Yahweh and Judah. Josiah was eventually killed by a foreign king, and Judah was still driven into exile. How frustrating it must have been to do everything “right,” relatively speaking, and yet still not see your goals fulfilled!\nJudah, like the whole world, did not simply need a king who would stay on the path of righteousness. They needed the King who had created the path of righteousness and who would walk it perfectly on their behalf. Jesus Christ is the ultimate King of Judah and of the whole world. The Father “made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:21). He is the true King, who not only leads us in the ways of righteousness, but more importantly, has made us righteous before God, once and for always.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The spring of my freshman year of college, I was coming out of one of the most difficult periods of my life. I was looking forward to a summer at home with my friends, and most of all, I was growing ever closer to a girl I had long admired and hoped to date. Susie and I had been friends since middle school, and that spring, we planned a conversation about whether or not we should consider dating—something I desperately wanted but Susie had resisted.\nThe day of the meeting came. For six hours, from the end of my classes that day until the meeting late in the evening, I just prayed to the Lord, asking for clarity of mind and wisdom. I was nervous and unsure of myself. By the grace of God we did end up dating at the end of the summer, but most amazing to me was how faithful the Lord was to answer my prayers for clarity and wisdom in the moment. It is one of the clearest answers to prayer I have experienced in my life.\nIn 2 Kings 20–21, we see the end of Hezekiah’s reign. King Hezekiah was the most David-like king since David himself. He was the most righteous king Judah had ever seen, reforming worship practices and trusting in the Lord above all. He was certainly not a perfect king, but he was not as wicked as the kings who had come before him.\nIn today’s passage, we read that Hezekiah has become ill. Isaiah (yes, the prophet for whom the book of the Bible is named), comes to the king and gives him a word from God: “Set your house in order, for you are about to die; you will not recover” (2 Kings 20:1). In his illness, Hezekiah just wants to be left alone. Can you relate? But “then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, ‘Please, LORD, remember how I have walked before you faithfully and wholeheartedly and have done what pleases you.’ And Hezekiah wept bitterly” (vv.2–3). Before Isaiah had even left the palace, God gave him another word to deliver to Hezekiah:\nThis is what the LORD God of your ancestor David says: \n“I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Look, I will heal you. \nOn the third day from now you will go up to the LORD’s temple. \nI will add fifteen years to your life. \nI will rescue you and this city from the grasp of the king of Assyria. \nI will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David” (vv.5–6).\nGod heard Hezekiah’s prayer, and his faith was not overlooked. No, Hezekiah was not perfect, but he trusted in a God who is. Why do we think we can do anything more? How often do we face dire circumstances and trust in our own might rather than the Lord? When we face conflict at work, do we try to resolve it without taking a moment to pray for wisdom? When we encounter a difficult parenting situation, do we discipline our children before we ask the Lord to show us how to love in the midst of our frustration? The Lord truly does hear our prayers. Our part is to turn to Him and share our hearts, to ask Him to do what only He can.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When Assyria besieged Jerusalem, King Hezekiah immediately humbled himself. He tore his clothes and put on sackcloth (2 Kings 19:1). Then he gathered his leadership team, and he sent them to the temple to seek the Lord. The officials confessed together: “Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace” (v.3). They owned that when the Assyrians’ attacked, it revealed a weakness in their own leadership.\nHezekiah may have sent tribute to Egypt in order to gain their aid in the battle against Assyria; Israel and Judah were often tempted to seek support from one neighboring superpower when they were attacked by another (2 Kings 17:4; Isaiah 20:5; Hosea 7:11). Sennacherib assumed that’s what Hezekiah had done when he called him out in his taunts: “Now look, you are relying on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff that will pierce the hand of anyone who grabs it and leans on it” (2 Kings 18:21). Isaiah had warned Judah against trusting in Egypt (Isaiah 31:1–5). Now Hezekiah was sending his officials back to Isaiah with their tails between their legs. Isaiah doesn’t rebuke the leaders. Instead, he becomes for them a minister of mercy. He declares they’ll be vindicated—not on the basis of their skill in diplomacy but on the basis of divine intervention: “‘[the king] will hear a rumor and return to his own land, where I will cause him to fall by the sword’” (2 Kings 19:7).\nIf the story stopped there, it would be a tidy little picture of grace and deliverance. But even when he found forgiveness, Hezekiah’s misplaced trust carried consequences. You see, just as Assyria’s army was pulling out, they received word that the king of Cush was marching north to attack them (v.9). Cush is modern-day Ethiopia, and at that time, it would have been part of southern Egypt. When the Cushites arrived, it signaled that Pharaoh was making good on his alliance.\nHave you ever been in an argument and just as things start to cool down, you—or your spouse or friend—say something that ups the ante, and things get heated again? That’s what Cush’s arrival was like. When Cush arrived, the Assyrians fired a nasty message back to Hezekiah: “‘Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries: They completely destroyed them. Will you be rescued?’” (v.11).\nNow Hezekiah was desperate, so he went up to the temple. He didn’t send his officials this time. No, the king went up himself, and he laid it all out before the Lord, literally spreading out the threatening letter he’d received before God (v.14). Then the king prayed:\n“LORD God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you are God—\nyou alone—of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth. \nListen closely, LORD, and hear; open your eyes, LORD, and see” (vv.15–16).\nHezekiah pleaded with God to be true to His promises. He begged for deliverance, and God answered miraculously. You see, trusting God isn’t always neat and tidy. Most often, it looks messy and desperate. However you are, come to Him today. Lay it all out before the Lord.\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

I’ll say, “They worshiped pretend gods instead of the one, true God.” That’s one way to describe it, but there’s more to idolatry than putting statuettes of false deities on your mantle and burning incense to them. In 2 Kings chapter 17, we find a chilling description of what idolatry is and how it exposes us.\nFirst, idolatry involves forgetting what God has done for us (vv. 7–8). God brought the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt from under the power of Pharaoh, king of Egypt (v.7), but they abandoned Him. They turned away from their Savior and put their trust in worldly customs and practices rather than in God. When we abandon biblical wisdom to follow what seems right by worldly standards, we do the same.\nSecond, idolatry involves closing our ears to God’s warnings (vv. 9–14). The people of Israel weren’t ignorant about what they were doing. God had clearly commanded them: “You must not do this” (v.12). He’d even sent prophets to warn them: “Turn from your evil ways and keep my commands” (v.13). But they failed to listen to His loving warnings. Any time we close our ears to godly counsel, we do the same.\nThird, idolatry reveals the fullness of our corruption (vv. 14–17). Israel goes from bad to worse. In the end, they sacrificed their own children in the fires of their sin. Our idolatry ultimately exposes the wickedness and brokenness of our sinful hearts. In Moby Dick, Herman Melville tells us about an idol worshiper named Queequeg who spends a day in fasting and bowing before a little idol named Yojo. Melville describes the protagonist, Ishmael, and how he restrained himself from correcting the pagan sailor. At one point Ishmael says to himself, “Heaven have mercy on us all… for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.”\nIn the end, Israel fell, and their idolatry was met with righteous judgment (vv. 18–23). God’s anger could no longer be held back from Israel, and He removed them from His presence by sending Assyria to take them into exile.\nWe’re so much like the nation of Israel. Like sheep, we easily go astray (Isaiah 53:6). Praise be to God that the downward spiral of idolatry can be broken. If we acknowledge the depth of our sin, we can return to the Shepherd and overseer of our souls. We can turn from idols and serve the Living God, because “he himself bore our sins in his body on the tree; so that, having died to sins, we might live for righteousness. By his wounds [we] have been healed” (1 Peter 2:24).\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    It’s easy as a Christian to be jaded about the world. All around us, we see injustice and sliding morals. It can seem as if there is no help for society. It’s also easy, when comparing the Church to the world around us, for Christians to feel somewhat “cocky” about our moral standing. After all, we’re God’s people, salt and light and all that. The world should listen to us! In this way, we’re like the kings of Judah, with pagan nations surrounding them and the backslidden Israelites up north (2 Kings 14).\nBut Judah’s kings were hardly heroes. Even when these rulers followed God, which was more often the exception rather than the rule, they didn’t follow Him wholeheartedly. Amaziah, for instance, “did what was right in the LORD’s sight, but not like his ancestor David” (2 Kings 14:3, emphasis mine). Each of Judah’s kings failed to eradicate false worship in the land. What led to their half-hearted devotion? Pride! After defeating Edom, King Amaziah flexed his bravado and challenged the northern kingdom to war. Jehoash, his evil Israelite counterpart, tried to be a voice of reason, rebuking Amaziah: “You have indeed defeated Edom, and you have become overconfident. Enjoy your glory and stay at home. Why should you stir up such trouble that you fall—you and Judah with you?” (v.10). Amaziah didn’t listen, so Judah was routed before Israel in battle (v.12).\nWhen we judge our neighbors’ sins but fail to repent from our own pride, we’re like the cocky kings of Judah. Before we attempt to brush the sawdust from our neighbor’s face, we need to remove the log that has impaled our own (Matthew 7:3–5). Christians are called to be more concerned about our own sin than we are of the world’s sins. We must believe that but for the grace of God, we’re capable of any failure. And when we see brokenness in the world, we mustn’t stand at a distance and snub our noses. Instead, we’re called to move toward the hurting, to move toward sinners (Luke 5:32).\nWhat can motivate such humility and love? It’s confidence that God is working even in the midst of great evil. Did you notice in these chapters what God does in Israel—not in Judah, but in terrible Israel? He fulfills prophecies and promises (2 Kings 14:25; 15:12). Though there is unthinkable evil at the hands of Israelite anarchy, God preserved the backslidden nation by holding back exile (vv.16,19–20). You see, “the LORD saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter,” and in His compassion, “he delivered them” (2 Kings 14:26–27). It’s easy to forget that God loved us even when we were dead in our trespasses and sins. Even when we were His enemies, Christ spoke life into us. How can we not be confident that He’ll love our broken world the same way?\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

Often, those students will stop by to talk, and we’ll have lighthearted conversation—either that or they’ll complain about the tests and quizzes they’ll be facing throughout the day. Sometimes we talk about serious things. They let me know what’s hard about a class or difficult about being a teenager at that particular moment. They ask for advice, and usually, I can give them some.\nThis morning I had one of those serious conversations. I was reading over 2 Kings 11–13 when some students walked in and asked me what I was doing. So I told them about this piece of writing I needed to work on, the one you’re reading now. I explained the story in all of its literal gory details, which led to a discussion about how the kings were “so dumb.” Why were they so blind to the fact that when they remained faithful to God, things went well for them and their people? Why couldn’t they muster the courage or care to be faithful?\nThere we were—me sitting in my chair, them leaning in the doorway, gripping backpacks—all of us shaking our heads in disbelief at the unfaithfulness of God’s people. Sure, there were some bright spots in the line of the kings, but for the most part, they were a bunch of idolaters. Even in their attempts to remain true to God they were ultimately inept and tolerated idolatry in the kingdom. So we railed against them, my students and I, feeling pretty good about ourselves as we did so. But by the time I reached 2 Kings 13, it was pretty hard for me to maintain that attitude.\n“But the LORD was gracious to them and had compassion on them, \nand he turned toward them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, \nand would not destroy them, nor has he cast them from his presence until now” (2 Kings 13:23).\nGod was willing to destroy because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Because of Him, the covenant would hold true. Then it dawned on me: I’m still counting on His keeping His covenant of love. That is the crux of my faith.\nOur disbelief at the kings’ unfaithfulness was misplaced. We should have been shaking our heads in disbelief at how God did not cast them away from His presence, nor did He destroy them right there on the spot. That’s what is truly shocking. In the same way, even though I deserve worse than physical death because of my sin, because of Christ’s work on the cross, I am not cast out but invited to draw near to Him (Romans 5:8; Hebrews 4:16). It’s a covenant that is in tact by His pure grace and compassion alone—not my ability to be faithful.\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

One constant at these events was the altar call. And like a lot of church kids, I went forward more than once over the years, so much so that the experiences blur together in my memory.\nBut I do remember this one time during an altar call when I felt convicted about the music I was listening to. So, on the way home, a friend and I decided to trash all our secular music as soon as we could. The next day we met up at his house, resolved to part with our worldlier music in one glorious, zealous, and committed act of devotion to God. Well, actually, it was a lot of little acts of devotion. I had a lot of music—hundreds and hundreds of cassette tapes and CDs—and they couldn’t all be obliterated in a single motion.\nBut we did it. Together, my friend and I destroyed them. We used a mallet and a hammer to smash them all to pieces—little tiny plastic shards of secular music. After all, we didn’t want anyone else to be able to listen to them. Needless to say, the mess in my friend’s driveway was a thing to behold. All these years later, how I approach music has changed, but my hope is to live even more committed to the Lord.\nNow, I know it’s not the same thing by a longshot, but when I read the word zeal in today’s passage, I feel like I understand Jehu a bit. He laid waste to the enemies of the Lord, and then he killed the Baal worshipers who’d used the temple as a latrine, just as if they were top-40 CDs stacked in a pile on my friend’s driveway.\nSadly, while Jehu did as the Lord commanded early on, he failed to be faithful in his reign as king over Israel. “He did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit—worshiping the gold calves that were in Bethel and Dan” (2 Kings 10:29). After going to such great lengths to rid the land of idolaters, he became an idolator himself.\nZeal for the Lord is good, but we also need to be faithful in driving out idolatry from our lives. As John Calvin once said, “Man’s nature, so to speak, is a perpetual factory of idols.” We need to cultivate a passion and commitment to the Lord that does not wax and wane, prepared to remove whatever obscures the glory of the crucified King. He is unlike Jehu or any other earthly king, and His passion and love for us never fails.\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

I doubt I’ll ever forget these words: “All the most important, most real things in the universe are invisible to us.” If my Toyota Camry had been struck by lightning, I would not have been jolted any more than I was that night.\nThe King and His kingdom are invisible to us. The Holy Spirit is invisible to us, and indeed, God the Father is too. We can read about God and see evidence of Him in our lives, but technically, He is invisible to our human eyes. This makes Him no less real, of course, but in my humanity I sometimes struggle to believe that the invisible is real. That God is here, with me now.\nI live as if the King is not abiding with me as promised (John 15:5). I walk around as if the visible things I can see and touch are all that truly matter, that they must take precedent. Money and clocks and transmissions and food—those are all “real.” But the King and His kingdom—do I live as if they are real? Are my eyes open to eternal realities, to what my human eyes cannot see?\nIn today’s reading, we read that the king of Assyria is understandably unhappy when one of his servants tells him that “Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in your bedroom” (2 Kings 6:12). Can you imagine the king’s fear and frustration? I mean, I’m actually afraid of what Alexa overhears while “listening” in our home. I can understand the king’s frustration when he realizes that Elisha, through the power of God, is able to know his every move and plan. So what does the king do? He sets out with “a massive army” to seize the prophet (v.14).\nThen, as the king’s army comes to surround the city, Elisha’s servant looks up and sees them and says, “Oh, my master, what are we to do?” (v.15), to which Elisha tells him, “Don’t be afraid, for those who are with us outnumber those who are with them” (v.16). Elisha then asks the Lord to “please open [the servant’s] eyes that he may see” the reality of the battle scene: the army surrounded them, but “the mountain was full of [God’s] horses and chariots of fire” (v.17).\nNow that’s a pretty dramatic scene, but what is truly remarkable is the fact that Elisha already knew that the angel armies were there! He saw what was invisible to the eyes of his servant. The servant saw the problem, and wondered what they needed to do to fix it. But Elisha knew that God, who is invisible, would care for them.\nIf I’m honest with myself, I know I am far more like the servant; I need to be reminded that the same God who saved me from my sin will be faithful to care for me now, in this life and in the life to come. Even now, He is at work on my behalf, though I may not be able to see how He is working. The reality is that our Savior has defeated sin and death, making us citizens of a forever kingdom, one of love, joy, and peace. May He open ours to see Him.\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    As I see it, one of the most chilling scenes in all of literature is found within Charles Dickens’ famous masterpiece, A Christmas Carol. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come visits Ebenezer Scrooge, showing him a conversation where a group of businessmen are discussing someone’s death. There isn’t much good to say about the person, and when the discussion turns to the man’s funeral, they agree there isn’t much point in going unless there’s a free lunch. Of course, the vision of the future is a revelation of Scrooge’s own death, and the defining, seemingly unanimous reality of his mark on the world is that he was a miserable, lonely, friendless, hermit of a man.\nThe scene disturbs me because it gets me thinking about my own death, about what people will have to say about me when I’m gone. What reputation will hang over my life here when it is over? I don’t know if you think about these things often, but they are worth considering. So, what will others say about you and your life when all is said and done?\nElisha’s ministry is miraculous. From multiplying limited stores of oil, to proclaiming fertility to a barren woman, to raising a dead child from the dead (2 Kings 4:1–37)—these scenes are just a few glimpses of Elisha’s part in God’s miracles. And yet, these miracles aren’t necessarily the defining statement on Elisha’s life and ministry. What is noted about him and his reputation is declared by the king of Judah, Jehoshaphat.\nLooking for wisdom from the Lord in light of how to fight the neighboring Moabites, Jehoshaphat and Joram seek insight. Upon hearing a prophet is in the area, they wonder who the prophet is. When it’s revealed that the prophet is Elisha, Jehoshaphat is satisfied because he believes “the word of the LORD is with him” (2 Kings 3:12). Clearly, Elisha has a powerful reputation!\nBrother, perhaps this could be said of you? Do you long for this kind of reputation? Beyond just your occupation, your career achievements, the status of your financial portfolio, even the family and children you leave behind, what would be said of you? Perhaps the best would be that you were a man of God’s Word.\nThis starts with our faith in the Word of God incarnate, Jesus Christ, who became flesh and blood, died for our sins, and was raised to life again on the third day. We become “men of the word of God every day” as we listen, read, study, memorize, meditate, and share the truth of the gospel daily.\nKnown for more than the miracles he performed, Elisha was a man of God’s word. What reputation will you leave behind? What declaration will be made you and your life on that last day?\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

Somehow the jesting hasn’t stopped. Apart from the humor this passage from 2 Kings brings us, it drives home the reality that the torch of ministry has been passed. Elisha now has the role of representing God as a prophet in Israel.\nThese kinds of transitions can be rather difficult. The church where I serve on staff has been in the midst of a transition between a man who served as senior pastor for over twenty-five years to a new leader. The fear that this new pastor won’t measure up to the impact of the former looms high. Following a faithful legacy-leader can bring out all kinds of insecurities and challenges that, just a few months earlier, showed no signs of bubbling to the surface.\nThe question that often sits below the surface in these kinds of transitions is one of God’s presence and favor: Is God still with us? Has His blessing, His power, His grace subsided in some way so that we’re worse off than when we were before?\nAfter Elijah is raptured away in the whirlwind, Elisha stands holding the mantle of ministry and asks, “Where is the LORD God of Elijah?” (2 Kings 2:14). The answer is immediate. God is still there, still powerful, still faithful, still holy. The transition from Elijah to Elisha was not a downgrade or transition from God’s power and glory to a lesser power and glory. In Elisha’s words to Elijah we are reminded of God’s promises to us in Christ: “As the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you (v.4).\nYou may not be in some sort of leadership transition today, but any transition in life can draw out these questions in our hearts. In the change from one career to another, Is God still here? In the transition from health to sickness, Where is the Lord God? The movement of life and the inevitable struggles that come along with this ever-changing world unsettle our hearts and minds, leading us to ask, Where is the Lord God?\nThe good news of the gospel is that God has not abandoned us. Even in the hardest changes of our lives, from youth to old age, from health to sickness, from stability to rapid change, the Lord has promised us in Christ that He will never leave us or abandon us (Deuteronomy 31:6; Hebrews 13:5). If God is present with us and is undiminished in his power and glory from one season to another, how much more can we trust his faithfulness!\nAs Elisha performed miracles, turning undrinkable water into potable water, and calling down a curse on those who mocked God (just like his mentor had before him), God’s power was clearly demonstrated, yes, but so was His faithfulness from one season and one generation to the next. In all our transitions and changes, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever” (Hebrews 13:8). He will never leave us.\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Who comes to mind when you think of the concept of courage? Is it the athlete who powers through the debilitating injury to lead his team to victory (or simply just finish a race)? Does the idea of courage bring to mind those who are first responders—the people who run toward the danger while everyone else is running away? Perhaps you think of individuals who have overcome the odds and accomplished some change or transformation in spite of great obstacles. Courage is often associated with overcoming.\nWhile they may not be the first people who come to mind when we envision courage, to me, the Lord’s faithful prophets during King Ahab’s reign in Israel absolutely embody courage. The author’s commentary on the character and rule of Ahab is astounding. “Still, there was no one like Ahab, who devoted himself to do what was evil in the LORD’s sight” (1 Kings 21:25). He was an utterly wicked man. So to be a faithful prophet of the Lord in the land of Israel, confronting the wickedness of Ahab, was dangerous.\nYet, there were some who did the job. Specifically, in today’s passage, we have the examples of Elijah and Micaiah, two prophets full of courage who spoke the truth of the Lord to Ahab. While Ahab kept prophets on retainer for whenever he needed a spiritual word to affirm his evil, a small few did not sell out their calling in order to placate the ears of the proud king. Instead of telling Ahab what he wanted to hear, they were committed to saying what God wanted to communicate—and that earned them a reputation. Ahab hated Micaiah but admitted to Jehosophat, “There is still one man who can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies good about me, but only disaster” (1 Kings 22:8).\nMicaiah was devoted to saying whatever the LORD said to him (1 Kings 22:14), and in doing so, he embodied real courage, the kind we need more of today. The courage of Micaiah is a challenge for us—to be men who say and do what the Lord calls us to say and do, even when the world around us pressures us to change or compromise. We may be afraid to speak the truth in the face of worldly power or to deal with the potential consequences of saying things that may be hard for some to hear, but being men of courage means remaining faithful to God in word and deed, regardless of how we are received.\nThis isn’t a license for us to be jerks in our speech. We’re different from Micaiah in that we don’t have a message of bad news to share with people. We have an astounding message to share—one of hope, peace, and grace: the good news of the gospel. We are called to do so with “gentleness and respect” (1 Peter 3:15–16). Our gracious King and Savior, Jesus Christ, has taken our judgment to the cross, and now we get to tell others about His mercy and love.\nCourage looks like being faithful and obedient to the Lord. It’s embodied in sharing our hope, even when people may not receive it or accept it. Courage believes the blessing of God for “servants who do his will” (Psalm 103:21). May we be men of courage in Christ.\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In our decaying society, it is becoming more and more difficult to speak the light of truth into the darkness. Some of the truths and moral claims that were once accepted by the broader culture are now regarded as bigoted hate speech. It is quite possible that faithful believers will soon have to weigh the implications of social ostracization and even judicial punishment for standing on the truth of the gospel. But this should not cause us to lose heart. In fact, reflecting on the providential work of God in the life of Elijah might even bolster our courage in the days to come.\nEmbedded in the dark narrative of Israel’s divided kingdom is the ministry of Elijah, which is a spark of light and hope for a seemingly hopeless nation. Elijah speaks truth to power and to the people, revealing what is necessary and good. However, this type of ministry does not come without a cost. Elijah lives as an outsider, under the pressure of imminent persecution and imprisonment for speaking the truth.\nBut Elijah is not alone in his faith. God informs him that there are 7,000 others like him among the people—namely, those who have not bowed the knee to idols (19:18). Elijah seems to have had a hard time believing he was not the only faithful Israelite remaining. When he’s atop Mount Carmel, ready for his showdown with the prophets of Baal, he reports, “I alone am left” (18:10). And this is just a short time after finding out Obadiah has a hundred prophets hidden away from Ahab and Jezebel. Elijah isn’t alone, and this news of 7,000 faithful should have come as a reminder that God is often at work behind the scenes in ways we cannot understand. Sometimes, when we have the courage to stand and speak truth against the rushing tide of cultural decay, as Elijah did so publicly, others are encouraged to stand with us.\nI often tell our church family that when we share the Word of God by the power of His Spirit, we get to experience the joy of being on mission with Him. Though we often think of biblical prophets as telling the future, but prophets also reminded people of what God had already done and of promises He had already made. In short, they proclaimed truth. They proclaimed the Word of God. And every one of us is called to do that.\nWhen we speak the truth of the gospel, we push back the darkness, inviting others to turn to God and honor Him with their lives so that they can experience the grace of Christ and the mercy of God’s forgiveness. The work of sharing the gospel is not just for pastors on Sunday morning. We are all called to speak the truth, whether it be in the workplace or a coffee shop, on the front yard with neighbors, or at the table with friends.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    God is always, without a doubt, faithful to His Word.\nWould you agree with that statement? Scripture is a historical account of His faithfulness to His people, even when they are not faithful to Him. But if we’re honest, it becomes harder to affirm the truth of God’s faithfulness in day-to-day life, especially when everything around us seems to be falling apart. Our trust can begin to falter in the face of our own failures and the failures of others. Perhaps even more difficult to bear are those circumstances where no one is clearly to blame. Still, God’s promises are always a more reliable anchor of reality than our current situations. Circumstances change, but God does not, which means we can trust His Word, even when we cannot see His hand at work.\nIn making His covenant with David, God made this promise: “When your time comes and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up after you your descendant, who will come from your body… and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever” and “my faithful love will never leave him” (2 Samuel 7:12–13,15). Therefore, the line of succession was established and it maintained rule over God’s people as God promised. In 1 Kings 15, we read that it was “for the sake of David” that the Lord “gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up his son after him and preserving Jerusalem” (v.4). This is a reminder, a testament, of God’s faithfulness to His people.\nThis narrative is also proof that God was faithful to His earlier promise in Genesis 49, that “the scepter [would] not depart from Judah” (v.10). And God did not depart from this promise. In fact, 1 Kings is primarily a narrative about the unfaithfulness of God’s people, which, ultimately, brought about division and even warfare. In other words, the very survival of the kingdom was solely dependent on God’s faithfulness to the covenant promise He made to David.\nThis is an important reminder for us all; we should not rely on our own understanding of the circumstances that surround us, but instead rest and trust “on every word that comes from the mouth of God” (Matthew 4:4). After all, our sin, the greatest conflict we will ever face, has already been dealt with on the cross of Christ. Though we have been unfaithful, the line of David was providentially protected by God to bring about the rightful heir to the throne, Jesus Christ. In preserving David’s line, God wasn’t just preserving Jerusalem; He was preserving the line through which Christ would come to rule as eternal King, granting us citizenship in His eternal kingdom, new Jerusalem.\nWhatever circumstances you are facing today, God is faithful and worthy of your trust. He has providentially overseen the trajectory of entire nations and directed the hearts of kings to bring about His purposes. Surely He is willing and able to keep His promises to you and me.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I grew up in a neighborhood with a large group of guys. We were all around the same age, and we spent a lot of time together up through middle school. I distinctly remember a petty rift in our group that divided us for several weeks one summer. We all learned that we could do less apart than we could together. The division in our group quickly diminished the rich bond we all enjoyed when we were together.\nThe rings of division tend to spread wide, affecting anyone near. The experience of that brief rift in relationship during my childhood pales in comparison to the implications of the division we read about in today’s passage from 1 Kings. The larger the division, the larger the impact. Imagine how many people are affected when an entire kingdom is divided?\nAfter the death of David’s son Solomon, the King of Israel, we read of the tragic story of the kingdom being torn apart, two kingdoms emerging from one. Under the rule of Jeroboam, ten northern tribes split and secede from the other two, maintaining the name Israel. The two remaining tribes became known as the southern kingdom, Judah, under the rule of Rehoboam. In a few short chapters of 1 Kings, we learn how both kingdoms headed for disaster. Judah’s heavy-handed Rehoboam no longer desired to serve the people, and Israel’s Jeroboam led the people backward into spiritual idolatry with the worship of golden calves.\nPerhaps you’ve heard the old adage, “As the king goes, so goes the nation.” So it was with Rehoboam when he “abandoned the law of the Lord—he and all Israel with him” (2 Chronicles 12:1). In fact, both Solomon and Rehoboam forfeited the promises given to David by their disobedience. Imagine the people of Israel, now divided into two kingdoms, confused and wondering: Where is God? Will He still keep the promises He made to David? What will come of us now? Their answer was just over the horizon.\nIn the case of our neighborhood’s summer rift, it was the “leaders” of each group that called a truce. Only then were we able to mend the division and come back together. As we reflect on the narrative of Israel, the question is, “Who will lead the divided nation back together?”\nIn 1 Kings, we read that “no one followed the house of David except the tribe of Judah alone” (1 Kings 12:30). And it is from the tribe of Judah that the true King would emerge, the one who would mend all divisions. The Gospel accounts make clear that only Jesus—not David, not Solomon, not Rehoboam, Jeroboam, or any other earthly king—is both the true son of David and the Son of God, the one whose perfect rule and kingdom will never end (Luke 1:32–33).\nEven better, Jesus Christ is not only King over all of Israel—He is King over all creation, over the entire cosmos. In Him, the hopes and longings of all God’s people find their fulfillment. Other kings tore Israel apart, but Jesus came to eternally unify God’s people through the bond of His sacrifice. That is a bond that can never be broken.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Scripture tells us that Solomon was the wisest man who ever lived (1 Kings 3:12; 4:29–31), but ultimately, he was also the cause of his own downfall. When walking in God’s ways and keeping His commands (3:14), King Solomon went on to do marvelous things to advance the kingdom of God. Rulers from around the world came to see the wisdom of Solomon at work and the resulting glory of his kingdom (4:34). “Throughout Solomon’s reign, Judah and Israel lived in safety from Dan to Beer-sheba, each person under his own vine and his own fig tree” (v.25). Their own fig tree!\nSolomon, however, had a fatal flaw; he did not heed the wisdom God had given him, and failed to keep his own heart (Proverbs 4:23). The wisdom Solomon encouraged his sons to seek (Proverbs 1–9) was hard-won after seeking what was right in front of his own eyes for so long, witnessing the effects of his sin. He lost his way, and at the end of his reign, Solomon’s attention became fixed on his love of many foreign women (1 Kings 11:1–3). He had seven hundred wives, some of them princesses from other lands, marriages that were almost certainly a play for more power in the political realm. And if the wives weren’t enough, the king also had three hundred concubines. He accumulated mass amounts of wealth for himself, and perhaps most telling, Solomon adopted the gods of other nations, and then introduced the worship of those gods to Israel (vv.4–8). Solomon’s downfall was rooted in his quest for pleasure and power, and it resulted in idolatry. His bad choices led to the downfall of God’s people, Israel.\nIn chapter 11, we see how this affected Solomon’s relationship with God: “The Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. He had commanded him about this, so that he would not follow other gods, but Solomon did not do what the Lord had commanded” (vv.9–10).\nIf this could happen to Solomon, a man who encountered God Himself—twice!—it can happen to us. All too often, we begin our faith journey resolute to follow our God, only to backslide on account of our own evil desires. We forsake the wisdom of God, and instead we choose to do what seems right to us.\nThankfully, there is a greater King than Solomon—greater than his father, King David. Jesus Christ never turned away from God, and remained faithful in His messianic ministry in His atonement for our sins. He is our Great Redeemer, the perfectly wise King of kings. “It is from [God] that [we] are in Christ Jesus, who became the wisdom of God for [us]—our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption” (1 Corinthians 1:30). By His Spirit, may we choose to abide with Him and align our wills with His that He might teach us His wisdom. May He restore us when we wander from His ways.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When our boys were little, my wife and I taught them a number of the questions and answers found in A Catechism for Boys and Girls. The first three questions are some of the most well known theological Q&A’s in all of church history. However, it was the third question that I found myself returning to over and over again, making sure our sons understood it. Question 3 asks: “Why did God make you and all things?” The answer is profoundly simple: “For His own glory.” These four all-important words teach us that God does everything for His own glory. I can imagine Solomon as a boy, growing up, learning theological truths from his own father, David. As king himself, Solomon remembered and spoke those truths at the dedication of the temple in his prayer and benediction.\nAfter sacrificing a seemingly endless number of animals (1 Kings 8:5), Solomon blessed the Lord for His covenantal faithfulness (vv.12–21). Standing there at the altar, he cried out for God to have mercy on His people when they sinned (vv.22–53), and then went on to bless them (vv.54–61). Solomon sought the Lord’s favor for His people, praying that God would give them spiritual rest, be near them, and remain with them. Yes, the king was praying on behalf of God’s people, but in doing so, he was also reminding them of their need for Him in all these things, “as each day requires” (v.59).\nThis reminder is for us too; we have a daily need for God to provide for our spiritual needs, all of which are fulfilled in Christ Jesus. God gives spiritual rest for those who believe in His Son. Those of us who are in Christ are now blessed with the constant presence of His Spirit and a promise that He will never abandon us (Hebrews 13:5). In a very real sense, God answered what Solomon prayed for at the dedication of the temple when He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to the cross. The altar Solomon stood before, pleading with God to forgive the sins of His people, pointed to the cross where Jesus sacrificed Himself for our sins.\nSolomon closes his prayer by asking God to remember His people, to “uphold [their] cause, as each day requires,” and ultimately, for “all the people of the earth [to] know that the LORD is God. There is no other!” (vv.59–60). The king then charges Israel to “be wholeheartedly devoted to the LORD our God to walk in his statutes and to keep his commands” as if they were brand new, each and every day (v.60).\nThe God of heaven and earth not only made all things for His own glory, but He does all things with the end goal of bringing Himself glory. God is pleased to hear and answer prayers for the forgiveness of sin, spiritual rest, and the longing for His divine presence, so that the nations might come to know Him as the true and living God—the only God.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When we moved to Tennessee a few years back, my wife and I searched and searched for our dream home. You know the one—the white farmhouse on a couple of acres, rolling hills and trees all around. The kitchen is amazing, perfect for entertaining. There’s a quiet room above the garage where I can write whenever inspiration strikes. And there’s plenty of room for the kids to play in the yard.\nWe didn’t find that house, not with our budget anyway. What we found was something that would work, but it was far from our forever home, the one we want our children to grow up in, the one we want to grow old in, the one we want our future grandkids to visit at Christmas. It’s a good house, and we’re thankful for it, but we can still see that farmhouse in the distance if we squint hard enough.\nNow, imagine you’re building a house for God, and money is no object. You literally have the resources of an entire nation at your disposal. Then what would you build? If you’re Solomon, you build the temple described in today’s reading. While many of the details may not mean much to us today, it’s clear that the finest materials were used and nothing was overlooked. It must have been beautiful. God was certainly pleased with Solomon’s efforts: “As for this temple you are building—if you walk in my statutes, observe my ordinances, and keep all my commands by walking in them, I will fulfill my promise to you, which I made to your father David. I will dwell among the Israelites and not abandon my people Israel” (1 Kings 6:12–13).\nAs glorious as the Bible tells us Solomon’s temple was, there’s one incredible thing that most readers miss: in many ways, it was a lot like other temples of the ancient world. Sure, there were some unique features in the house Solomon built for the Lord, and there was, of course, no idol in the most holy place, as there would have been in the temple’s pagan counterparts. Still, the basic design would have been familiar to people near and far.\nWhen I first discovered this truth, it was jarring. I wanted everything about God’s temple to be utterly unique, for there is no god like Him, not by a long shot. But then I realized what God was really saying to His people in the design of His house. He was speaking to them in a language they could understand. He was using the culture and conventions of the day to draw near to His people. The truth is, God didn’t need a temple to dwell among His people. But He chose to have Solomon build Him a house, because a temple in Jerusalem—a beautiful one at that—would be a way for Israel and all the people of the ancient Near East to recognize that He was there among them.\nIt’s not unlike how God put on flesh and became a man, wearing the culture and conventions of the day, speaking the language, and getting His hands dirty caring for people who needed a physical touch. We cannot ascend to God—not without Christ—so God bends low to be near us. That’s what the temple was all about, and it pointed ahead to the incarnation of the Son of God, and further still to the gift of the Holy Spirit, who has made His people into a temple (1 Corinthians 3:16), one more precious than anything Solomon could have constructed.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

I remember carefully placing Jonah, still strapped into his baby carrier, onto the kitchen floor in our home, trying not to disturb him. If he woke up, we’d have to feed him or change him or rock him back to sleep—or who knows what else he might need. As long as he slept, we were doing okay. Every minute that passed was one more minute that Jonah wouldn’t learn our little secret: we had no idea what we were doing.\nA few weeks in, and everyone was miserable. Jonah seemed to cry constantly, and because none of us were sleeping through the night, we were all tired and cranky. In desperation, Laurin reached out to her friend, Jennifer, a pediatric nurse who just happened to have written a book on caring for newborns. Jennifer came over the next day. She gave us a schedule for feeding and sleeping, showed us how to give Jonah an evening routine sure to conk him out, and even provided us with a few swaddling lessons. We took our newfound newborn knowledge and immediately applied it. Believe it or not, within the week, Jonah was sleeping through the night—and so were we.\nI love when change happens quickly. I think we all do. If your pants were looser just minutes after getting on the treadmill, wouldn’t you run more? If you could learn a new language just by watching a foreign film or two, wouldn’t you? But that’s not usually how life works. Normally, change takes place slowly. When change does happen quickly, it seems almost too good to be true. That’s how we felt that first time Jonah slept through the night. We could barely believe our ears—silence instead of crying.\nAnd that’s how it was for Solomon too. One night he was foolishly offering sacrifices to God at Gibeah (1 Kings 3:4), unaware of how worshiping the at one of the so-called “high places” was to put the one true God on the same level as the false gods who sought to lead the people of Israel into idolatry. A short time later, Solomon was back in Jerusalem, offering proper sacrifices before the ark of the covenant on the altar sanctioned by God (v. 3). What happened to Solomon in between? God gave him wisdom.\nSolomon immediately knew that God ought to be worshiped according to God’s instructions, rather than the convenient traditions of the day. But that’s not all. He was able to judge the people of Israel with justice and fairness. And soon, his wisdom was known far and wide. “Emissaries of all peoples, sent by every king on earth who had heard of his wisdom, came to listen to Solomon’s wisdom” (1 Kings 4:34). Because of Solomon, God’s people were blessing the nations of the world, just as God told Abraham they would (Genesis 12:3).\nHere’s the incredible thing: God promises to give us wisdom, too, if only we will ask. Scripture tells us, “If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you” (James 1:5). Now, God doesn’t say it will come instantaneously or be as pronounced as Solomon’s, but He does promise to bless us with wisdom. So, ask Him for it—and when He gives it, follow Solomon’s example: use your new wisdom to love God and others well.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    First Kings opens with David reigning in Jerusalem. But this is not the David we remember—the David who slew Goliath with a stone, the David who lived out in the wild, keeping one step ahead of a murderous king, the David who danced freely before the Lord as the ark of the covenant was brought to Zion. This David can no longer fight, run, or dance. He is frail, sick, and old. He’s unable to keep warm, no matter how many blankets are brought to his chambers. His story, this side of heaven, is coming to a close. He knows it, and so does everyone else.\nDavid was far from a perfect man. Years earlier, he sinned with Bathsheba, and then he murdered her husband, Uriah. David repented, and I believe God cleansed his heart, just as he asked Him to (Psalm 51:10), but still I wonder if all those memories—the shame, the sorrow for sin—came rushing back into his heart when Bathsheba entered his room in those final days. She wasn’t there to bring up old wounds, however; she was there to fight for her son, Solomon: “Now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him” (1 Kings 1:20). David didn’t refuse her.\nThroughout his life and reign, David trusted God to be faithful, despite his own sins and weaknesses. That’s why I think it’s so fitting that Solomon was given his father’s throne. As the son of Bathsheba, Solomon was a product of David’s sin. Solomon wasn’t the son who was conceived by the original illicit act, of course. He came sometime later, after Uriah was gone and David married Bathsheba. But still, Solomon would never have been born if David hadn’t sinned in the first place. Solomon is, therefore, a product of David’s weakness while also being a testament to God’s unbreakable promises. He is an image of beauty wrought from brokenness, light pulled from darkness, and redemption pieced together from bits of rebellion. In that, there is a flashing neon sign pointing to the gospel.\nNone of us deserves to be a recipient of God’s grace and mercy, yet here we stand. And not only that—the Lord is taking our brokenness and turning it into something whole and new, something truly beautiful. Like Solomon before us, we will someday reign (2 Timothy 2:12; Revelation 20:4–6). When that day comes, it will not be because we’ve earned it or in any way deserve it. It will be because God is faithful and loves us more than we can possibly imagine. But that’s how redemption works—we trade our junk for His glory. Remember, it was sinful hearts that sought Jesus’s blood, but it is only Jesus’s blood that can cleanse sinful hearts. God is in the business of making the dark and ugly places of life into something new and beautiful. In that, there is hope for us all, no matter how high the stack of regrets we may carry with us.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

I, for one, don’t like it when my hard work isn’t recognized. As I jokingly complained to a former college professor about being passed over for an honor (one I believed I had every right to expect to win), he kindly responded to me, “God sees you.” Those words sucked the hot air right out of my bloated ego balloon. \nIn Nehemiah’s case, it wasn’t a matter of a puffed up ego that was driving his repeated petition to God in this chapter. Nehemiah feared that the exiles’ constant lack of faithfulness to the Word of God would somehow end up on his record. As he brought this account of his leadership to a close, Nehemiah wanted to be clear that he was a leader who was faithful to the Word of God, even when the people he’d led couldn’t go five minutes without forgetting that very Word. \nNehemiah wanted it made known that he was zealous for the holiness of God above all. And so he said to the Lord, “Remember me…my God, and look on me with compassion according to the abundance of your faithful love” (Nehemiah 13:22). But God did see Nehemiah and his heart. The fact that we have an account of Nehemiah’s work recorded in Scripture proves that God recognized Nehemiah’s faithful leadership. \nThere may be times when we wonder what the point is in holding fast to God’s Word. In those moments, we need to be reminded that God sees us. When we feel there’s no use in being faithful to God when earthly culture (and even many within the Church) has abdicated the truth, this chapter in Nehemiah motivates us to be people of holiness because God knows us and He sees us. We are reminded to “fight the good fight”—even when everyone else seems to have abandoned the battle—because our Father pours out His favor on His children.\nWe should look to Jesus, who came to a culture of faithlessness, hypocrisy, and immorality, and remember that it was zeal for His Father’s house that consumed Him (John 2:17). Although He cried out as one abandoned by God on the cross, Jesus’ victorious resurrection validated the words His Father had spoken over Him: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased. Listen to him!” (Matthew 17:5). \nBrothers, look to Jesus and do not grow weary in doing good. If no one else around you will keep the faith, press on. Even if everyone else abandons the gospel, let it be the passion of your own life. God sees you, and the reward He offers through Christ Jesus is great. He will remember His children, with favor!\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When my daughters were infants, they were dedicated at the church we attended. In a brief, happy ceremony, the pastor spoke words over them in front of the congregation, dedicating them to the Lord and calling the church to invest in raising them to follow Jesus. It was a beautiful moment, each time. \nWhen the church I grew up in and the Christian company I work for each broke ground for new buildings, they held ceremonies to dedicate the structures to the work of the Lord. The projects were prayed over and a biblical charge was given to everyone present, reminding us of the gospel’s greater mission.\nThe dedication of Jerusalem’s wall was nothing like these instances at all. Yes, the work was dedicated to the Lord and prayers were prayed. But this was no ceremonial groundbreaking, featuring men in suits awkwardly wielding monogrammed brass shovels. Nor was it a baby dedication wedged in at the beginning of a Sunday morning service. This was a dedication. \nThe Levites—the tribe dedicated to the service of the temple and worship before God—led thanksgiving and singing with harps, cymbals, and lyres, and with singers and musicians gathered from all around. That’s a full band.\nThey purified themselves and the city so that it literally gleamed, but more importantly, so it reflected God’s law and their desire to honor Him. Then they encircled the city with praise and prayer and thanks, with one column going to the left and the other to the right around the wall. And their rejoicing could be heard far and wide (Nehemiah 12:43)—hardly the sedate ceremony we so commonly call “a dedication.”\nThis raucous, joyous celebration of Jerusalem’s rebuilding is but a foretaste of what Scripture tells us is to come. In Nehemiah’s day, a crowd of thousands lifted praise that could be heard from far away. One day, a numberless multitude will gather in praise with a sound like thunder. In Jerusalem, they offered sacrifices as a pleasing offering before God. In the days to come, a ceaseless sacrifice of praise will be lifted up. The old Jerusalem was worthy of passionate worship before God. One day, the new Jerusalem will teem with worshipers and pulse with praise. \nNehemiah and those with him knew they were commemorating and dedicating something profound and miraculous—a city established by God’s redeemed people, in God’s promised land, and under God’s protection. They could not have known how this would echo into the millennia to follow, as an appetizer for the unbridled, perfect celebration of a wedding between Christ and His Church—the same celebration every believer will have the joy to participate in one day.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I played football in both my freshman and sophomore years of high school. I quit after my sophomore year because I had not yet hit my growth spurt and didn’t get any playing time. That, and I thought my time would be better spent working a job and hanging out with friends. \nSnider High School has had one of the most successful high school football programs in the state of Indiana since the 1980s. Russ Isaacs was an assistant coach from 1983 to 1990, and a head coach from 1991 through 2009, my senior year. He is the winningest football coach in Indiana high school football history with a record of 194–32. \nCoach Ike was an incredible coach because he is a remarkable human being. But his success and winning record are a result of an established culture of sound leadership and coaching within his staff. He has left a legacy of leadership in the Snider High School football program. In fact, the team’s current head coach used to work under Coach Ike as his defensive coordinator. When I read the long list of priests in Nehemiah 11 and 12 and the legacy of leadership God established for the people of Israel, Coach Ike and his legacy of leadership come to my mind.\nIt is tempting to gloss over these two chapters in Nehemiah. It just looks like a list of names, because that’s what it is. But it’s also a lot more than just a list of who’s who. These names found in Nehemiah 11 and 12 reflect a legacy of leadership that the Lord established over His people and for their good.\nThese men served the people of God, often to their own detriment, and despite other opportunities that may have been available to them at the time. In Isaiah 48, the prophet writes of God’s leaders saying, “For they are named after the Holy City, and lean on the God of Israel” (v.2). God’s leaders must learn to lean on Him for His guidance and leadership, instead of trying to muster it up in their own strength. \nHas God called you to lead His people through your local church? Those of us who serve as ministry leaders, pastors, elders, deacons, or in other church leadership roles must understand that our capacity to serve will only go as far as our reliance upon the Lord to carry us. While we are still broken sinners in need of the grace of God to lead us, we must lean on the Holy Spirit for His wisdom and guidance. \nDo you lean on the Lord to lead His people? Or do you lean on your own understanding and gifts? May we learn to lead the people of God by relying on the grace of God. And may we leave a legacy of leadership defined by love-fueled service, not pride-fueled greed.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

I’ve lived in cities, on an island, in the mountains, and in the foothills. Every place where I’ve lived has had its own unique beauty and appeal, and its own particular downsides. \nIn the Old Covenant, the land of Israel had its various geographical locations, together with all of the accompanying pros and cons. One might suspect that every one of God’s people would have wanted to live in Jerusalem, since it was the city of the great king. However, this was not so. After the city was rebuilt and made habitable again in the days of Nehemiah, many of the people refused to return and live there.\nThe refusal of the people to move to Jerusalem was owed, in part, to the fact that the people had become comfortable where they were. They had little interest in being fully concerned with the work of the Lord that occurred in Jerusalem. The rulers went up to govern in the judicial courts. Several of the Levites returned there to do the priestly work at the temple precinct. Other Levites stayed behind to continue the priestly work in other parts of Israel. \nBut many of the people remained outside the city because of a desire for worldly comfort. Surely, more spiritual commitment was expected from the inhabitants of Jerusalem than from other inhabitants of Israel. Matthew Henry explained the failure of those who refused to seek habitation in the city of God, when he wrote: “Those who care not for being holy themselves are shy of dwelling in a holy city; they would not dwell in the New Jerusalem itself for that reason, but would wish to have a continuing city here upon earth.”\nJerusalem foreshadows the city of God that He has prepared for His people in the hereafter. The writer of Hebrews picks up on this spiritual typology of Jerusalem when he writes, “Here we have no continuing city, but we seek the one to come” (13:14). Abraham, the father of believers, teaches us the principle of seeking after a dwelling place in the heavenly city—even while he dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob in the land of promise (11:9). \nGod has prepared a heavenly city for His people. He has done so on account of the fact that “He is not ashamed to be called our God” (Hebrews 11:16). We ought to be a people who long to dwell with the God who has prepared and secured a city for us through the saving work of His Son. Jesus is the building of the heavenly Jerusalem by His death and resurrection. No matter where we live in this life, we are pilgrims pressing on to the city that has the firmest of foundations, whose builder and maker is God.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    We have been trekking through a book full of twists and turns, a story that mirrors the basic facets of our daily lives—God’s promises, our doubts, and the enemy’s schemes. Nehemiah’s story is a story we can all relate to. Until, perhaps, today’s passage comes along.\nLike a disjointed puzzle, we are presented with a stack of names and ordinances and promises that we have a hard time piecing together into a coherent picture. What do these names have to do with anything? How can we, in the 21st century, relate to farming contracts in the ancient world?\nIn some ways, we can’t. Nehemiah’s story is a story stuck in history and a key piece to pushing God’s bigger story toward the coming of Christ. In all our reading, studying, and reflecting on Nehemiah, we shouldn’t forget that this is an event that actually happened to real people, in a real place.\nHowever, as we’ve already pointed out, the story mirrors our daily lives. This passage in particular details how all of God’s people came together to rejoice in God’s faithfulness in helping them accomplish the rebuilding of the wall. Together they agree to give a portion of their crops and earnings to the Lord, to thank Him for His grace, and to remind themselves that they have nothing without Him.\nFor us today, this principle is not much different. Everything we have belongs to the Lord: our family, our jobs, our money, our time, and even the breath in our lungs. We don’t need to build a wall to remember and appreciate this. As these ancient people gathered together to thank God for His faithfulness, we also should gather together every week with God’s people, receiving grace and pouring out praise to our faithful God. We have nothing without Him, and so everything we own is His.\nMay we say with Nehemiah’s generation, “We will not neglect the house of our God” (10:39). He has been faithful to us. And so may we learn to love Him and His commands, and remain faithful to Him in turn (John 14:15).\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I once heard of a theologian who was asked by one of his students, “How much time should we pray and read Scripture each day?” The story goes that the student had in mind a certain amount of time for each—say, one hour in prayer and one hour in study. His teacher responded, “The better way is to spend two hours reading the Scripture on your knees in prayer.” What a simple but profound insight. How true it is, because the Scriptures often give shape to our prayer.\nIn my experience, I have come to understand that when I sit down to read Scripture, Scripture also tends to “read me,” so to speak. God’s Word reminds me of who I am—a sinner unable to perfectly live in faithfulness to God’s Word. However, Scripture also reminds me of who God is, namely, a Holy God who is perfectly faithful to His Word, but also gracious to those who repent of their unfaithfulness. \nOne of the reasons I find Nehemiah 9 to be one of the most moving passages of prayer in all of Scripture is because this prayer moves through the Bible itself, reminding the people of God’s faithfulness from Genesis to Kings—in spite of Israel’s unfaithfulness. And it is through Bible-shaped praise, confession, and petition that God’s people are reminded that He has made a name for Himself, a name that endures from generation to generation to this day (v.10).\nIsn’t it amazing that when we repent of unfaithfulness, God stands ready to forgive? Isn’t it good to remember that God is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love? (Nehemiah 9:31; Psalm 145:8). Isn’t it comforting to remember that even when we, as God’s people, are faithless, our God will not forsake us?\nThe good news of the gospel is that the story of God’s faithfulness does not end in Kings or in Nehemiah. In the New Testament we are reminded that all of the promises of God find their “yes” in Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 1:20). Jesus is the perfect Israelite who was completely faithful to God’s Word. And because of Jesus’ sacrificial death for our unfaithfulness and sin, we can be forgiven. Because of Jesus’ resurrection and ascension to the right hand of God, we can boldly approach His throne with confidence (Hebrews 4:16).\nBecause of the gospel, when I prayerfully read Scripture I am able to see that God has been faithful to His people from generation to generation. Because of the gospel, when Scripture reads me, I can openly pray and confess my unfaithfulness, knowing that He is faithful to forgive me and cleanse me of all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9). This is how Scripture shapes our prayer. It gives us the words to shout, “Oh God! You made a name for yourself that endures to this day” (Nehemiah 9:10).\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    If you’ve ever lost something precious only to find it once again, you know the feeling of joy that can overcome you at its rediscovery. Every time I return back to the home I left in the San Francisco Bay area, I find myself both laughing and crying—and both seem fit emotions for those moments. \nThis is especially true if I go to a ballgame at AT&T Park, the home of the San Francisco Giants. There is euphoria at the smell of the ballpark-favorite garlic fries. There are tears at hearing a crowd of 40,000 sing Journey’s “Lights” in the eighth inning. There is elation at Buster Posey knocking a game-winning home run. All of these sights, smells, and sounds are precious to me, and yet I get to experience them far too infrequently these days. \nI imagine the people of Israel were met with many conflicting emotions as they made their way home to Jerusalem. They had returned to rebuild the walls of their city and the temple within those walls, but there was something else that needed to be rebuilt: their spiritual life. In order for God’s people to reestablish their identity of faith, they needed to be reminded of the central truth of what made them unique among all nations.\nIt wasn’t a temple (other nations had those). It wasn’t a powerful city (Babylon could have sufficed). It wasn’t even a strong leader (Alexander the Great was coming). What made Israel unique among all the nations was that God had spoken directly to them and given them His Word. For too long that Word had been neglected, but on this day, Israel reestablished among themselves the chief importance of God’s Word for all of life. \nHowever, hearing the book of the law read to them was not met without conflicting emotion. “For all the people were weeping as they heard the words of the law” (Nehemiah 8:9). But convicted as they were, that day was not one for mourning and weeping; it was a holy day to the Lord. It was a day of returning to the city, yes, but it was also a day of God’s people turning their hearts back toward Him in repentance. And so Ezra and Nehemiah instructed them: “Do not grieve, because the joy of the LORD is your strength” (v.10).\nIn everything that occurs in Nehemiah 8, we are forced to think about the place of God’s Word within our own lives. Too often we neglect, forget, or flat-out ignore the fact that God Himself has spoken to us and for us. Instead of listening to the Word preached, examining the Word in community, and applying the Word personally, we make the Bible less than a priority in our lives. Because of that, we often find our lives in ruins and wreckage, when in reality, we have God’s inspired Word to lead us in every day and in all ways (2 Timothy 3:16).\nPerhaps we need to rediscover God’s Word in a fresh way. Ezra’s preaching, as well as Israel’s commitment to once again read, listen, and understand Scripture, allowed for spiritual renewal among them. When we turn to Scripture we will find that same renewal is waiting for us as well. \nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

It would pack out most MLB stadiums and be a huge concert turnout. It’s quite a crowd.\nBut 42,000 is a small city—barely a city at all, in fact. It’s really more of a town. And that is the entire number of the exiles who returned to Jerusalem. Millions departed Judah in captivity, and 42,000 returned. When we think about it in these terms it sounds feeble and small. It is more sad than celebratory.\nYet this small number is no more sad than the seed that dies and shrivels and cracks to give life to a new plant (Matthew 13:1-22). For that is what these 42,000 exiles were: new growth of God’s people in God’s promised land. They were a fresh start and a kept promise and measure of God’s faithfulness. \nWhile the list of names upon names (fifty verses worth) might seem cumbersome and meaningless as we struggle to read them, they are a record of a legacy. Every family represented had roots in Jerusalem and would grow there again because God was faithful. Every priest and Levite would once again serve God in the temple because God brought them home to do so, and they took this responsibility seriously. They sought to keep God’s law in selecting leaders. Those who “feared God more than most” (Nehemiah 7:2), and those of the correct lineage were selected according to God’s priestly dictum and manner (Urim and Thummim), so that God’s house would be unsullied. \nThese 42,000 had paid the price for their ancestors’ unrighteousness, and they had every intention of clinging to the God who had never let go of them. They clung to the words of David from Psalm 34, that “the Lord redeems the lives of His servants and all who take refuge in Him will not be punished” (v.22). Because they were small in number and barely established, God’s people held to the promise that “one who is righteous has many adversities, but the Lord rescues him from them all” (v.19). How could they not? They’d already been rescued from Egypt, from invaders, and now from exile too. \nFrom this humble restart Israel would be established again. Families would resettle, the temple would be rebuilt, and hope would come again—hope for a Messiah, One who would gather the exiles from every tribe and nation around the globe. For God will always bring His people home and redeem the righteous. \nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In August 2016, I was beginning a third year of full-time graduate school, working a full-time job, and serving in our church’s student ministry. It was a busy season, and I was stressed. Around that time, my wife began experiencing a sort of persistent anxiety she never had before, and it even resulted in a few rough panic attacks. With the help of a doctor and a counselor, she was able to fight the anxiety, and I was able to support her through it. \nWhile supporting Susie, I was a strong, encouraging husband, but it’s like my body was just storing up my own stress to be released later. A few weeks after Susie’s panic attacks subsided, I got sick. I felt anxious like I never had before, and I became unduly overwhelmed. It felt like I was drowning in work, school, and life in general. In the face of what seemed insurmountable work and life circumstances, I was not relying on the Lord to be my strength. I was relying on myself.\nIn Nehemiah 6, the wall was finally rebuilt despite attempts to sabotage the work of Nehemiah and the others. The conspirators—Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem—sent a message to Nehemiah in an attempt to lure him away from his work at the wall and to do him harm. They did not want him to succeed in the work the Lord had set out for him to do. \nBut Nehemiah saw through the veiled attempts to undermine him. He said of the man who delivered the threatening message, “He was hired, so that I would be intimidated, do as he suggested, sin, and get a bad reputation, in order that they could discredit me” (v.13). Nehemiah was given a task by God. He was not going to let the intimidation of man prevent him from obeying God. And so in the midst of many attempts to distract and discredit him, Nehemiah says, “But now, my God, strengthen my hands” (v.9).\nThe Lord has called you to a work. Whether it is parenting your children, teaching a squirrely third grade class, manufacturing auto parts, or leading a church—He has called you to a work that He intends for you to use for His glory, not your own (Ephesians 2:10). Others, including Satan, may try to assail you. In the face of these attacks, you can choose to trust in your own strength for deliverance. Or you can rely on the Lord to strengthen your hands.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    There seems to be no limit to the injustices that occur in the world. Sadly, this is also the case in the Church. When I was a boy, my dad used to say, “Nick, no one will hurt you so much as people in the Church.” I have found this to be true in my experience over the ten years I have been in pastoral ministry. The thing that makes injustice within the Church so burdensome is the fact that we expect better of the people of God. \nMany claim to have left Christian community on account of the injustices and offenses of the members of the Church. But while professing believers have often done much harm to other members of His body—and also hindered the spread of the gospel—God will always remember His people on account of Christ, the perfectly righteous representative of His people. That truth is seen in Nehemiah 5. \nIn the days when Israel was rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, God sent a famine on the land. Because of the famine, many rulers of God’s people were taking advantage of their brethren. They oppressed the sons and daughters of their brothers on account of a shortage of food. When the people complained, Nehemiah rose to stand up for the poor and the oppressed. He did what any of us should do when we see people in the Church taking advantage of others’ unjust gain. Scripture says Nehemiah was filled with righteous anger (Nehemiah 5:6) and brought civil charges against the leaders who were oppressing the people (vv.7-13). He then ensured that the religious leaders would hold their rulers responsible to provide a full restoration of the possessions they had taken.  \nNehemiah showed himself to be an upright and generous governor. When other governors took from the people for selfish gain, Nehemiah refused to live in luxury at the expense of the impoverished members of the Church. Unlike the other rulers, Nehemiah refused to place heavy burdens on the people. His heart was filled with love for the people of God and a desire to see all of them provided for. He hoped the Lord would see him and his faithfulness. And so he said, “Remember me favorably, my God, for all that I have done for this people” (Nehemiah 5:19).\nIn all these ways, Nehemiah was a type of the One to come. When Jesus came to Israel, the rulers and leaders were oppressing the people. When He came to the temple and saw the way in which those who sold sheep and oxen for the sacrifices were extorting money from His people, He was filled with anger, throwing over tables and driving out the money-lenders. When He observed the way in which the religious leaders were placing heavy burdens on God’s people, Jesus stood and said, “Come to Me, all who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). \nJesus refused to please or comfort Himself. Instead, He was homeless throughout most of His public ministry and died naked on the cross for the sins of His people. In all that He did, Jesus gave up all that He had for the redemption and care of the people of God. May we learn to follow in the footsteps of Jesus, the greater Nehemiah.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Right now, I and the other elders at our church are searching for a new building. Our children’s ministry space is maxed out. Our pastors are all crammed into a tiny office. We’re running two Sunday morning worship gatherings and are desperate to not add a third. Still, these are good problems to have for a 7-year-old church, I suppose.\nAs we’ve been searching for a new location, we’ve run into dead ends at every turn. Some places are too expensive, others are too small, and still others are gobbled up by investors before we get a chance to look at them. We often want to say alongside the Israelites in today’s passage, “Listen, our God, for we are despised!” (Nehemiah 4:4).\nAs we’ve seen so far, the Israelites were tasked with rebuilding the wall, and things haven’t gone as easily as they would have liked. Most recently in the story, we see their enemies try to Trojan-horse their efforts, so to speak, and then sneak in unnoticed. But God proves His faithfulness in thwarting their attempts, and the rejuvenated Israelites get back to building.\nNehemiah’s story is not a story about a man and his people building a wall, though that’s the historical aspect of it. The message from the book of Nehemiah is also not about church building projects like the one my congregation is undertaking. No, it’s primarily about trusting in God’s faithfulness when opposition seems overwhelming.\nWe know in our daily lives that Satan is constantly in opposition to our obedience to God. Our flesh wars against us, pressing us to seek quick fixes rather than cultivating lasting joy. More than that, we let these things cause us to doubt God’s goodness and faithfulness. To put our passage today another way, we wonder, God, can’t you see? Can’t you hear? We are being attacked on every side!\nBut God is not in the business of quick fixes. He is making all things new (Revelation 21-22), and He is patient with sinners (Romans 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9), calling us to enter into His deliberate but still unfolding plan (Matthew 28:18-20; 2 Corinthians 5:11-21). May we not grumble against Him, but remember the faithfulness of our “great and awe-inspiring Lord” (Nehemiah 4:14). May we remember and give thanks for Christ Jesus, who went to the cross to absorb God’s wrath for us—for the joy set before Him (Hebrews 12:2)—and to give us peace until He returns.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Do you ever feel like you’re waiting for meaningful work to come into your life? That your present situation is beneath you in some way, but one day you’ll find your true calling?\nRead Nehemiah 3. Every word. All the way through. It might take some effort, but it’s nothing compared to the work the people in the chapter are doing.\nNehemiah 3 is about how the work gets done. This chapter is filled with people’s names and the sections of the wall and gates they worked on. It’s a strange little chapter if you’re reading it looking for something poetic or sentimental. But it is a powerful record of people rising to the occasion to rebuild what enemies had once torn down. It is also a powerful statement about calling.\nThink about these people for a minute. Take Jedediah son of Harumaph from verse 10 as an example. We’re told he worked on the broad wall—the outer city wall—between Rephaiah son of Hur and Hattush the son of Hashabneiah. Can you imagine them there—Rephaiah, Jedediah, and Hattush—working away in the dust and sun? Can you hear the chatter between them as they take their water breaks and compare their busted knuckles and blistered palms? Can you hear them talking about what things will be like when the wall is finished?\nThese guys were doing real work. Hard work. They are in this chapter not for being celebrities or for splitting the atom, but for moving rocks—a job so difficult that criminals are sentenced to do it as punishment. Why does God’s Holy Word contain a record of men stacking rocks?\nOne reason, I believe, can be found in a little detail we’re given about Jedediah, and also about Meremoth (v.21), Benjamin and Hasshub (v.23), the priests (v.28), Zadok (v.29), and Meshullam (v.30). Do you see what they all have in common? These people were all working on the parts of the wall that were right outside their homes. They were doing the hard work that was in front of them.\nMore often than not, this is our calling in life: to do the work that is in front of us, and to do it faithfully. Though we might be tempted to go around the world trying to find our calling in life, more often than not the place where we’re needed most is right outside our own front doors.\nIt is no small thing to have your name included in the Bible. Though some in this chapter are called out for their idleness—like the Tekoite noblemen (v.5)—most of the names in this chapter are there to honor the work of these men and women who worked to rebuild their hometown out of the ruins in their own neighborhoods.\nLook outside your own front door. What work is there to do? How can you help? Maybe that’s your calling right now.  \nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    There are often times in the Christian life when we face the tension of obeying God’s Word in our current culture. In His Word, He speaks; the Bible calls us to a life of bold obedience. However, there are times when in pursuing God’s call, we are confronted with conflict. There are times when our obedience to God places us in direct opposition to the world. These times call us to have faith and courage, to remember that God is sovereign over all things. This is the truth that fuels our faith.\nIn the latter section of Nehemiah 2, the prophet returns to Jerusalem with a burden to rebuild its walls. King Artaxerxes grants Nehemiah’s request, and even through the citizens are willing to work, he quickly finds opposition by some.\nWhile Nehemiah knows the king of the land is behind these efforts, he ultimately attributes the authority behind this task as coming from God. Nehemiah understands that, in light of God’s sovereign providence, the dire situation is not insurmountable. He believed “the God of the heavens is the one who [would] grant [them] success” (v.20).\nTherefore, because this is a divinely orchestrated blessing, Nehemiah is rightly convinced that those against the plan to rebuild are ultimately in opposition to the work of God. In light of this, he responds with courageous and prayerful obedience by carefully planning his course of action. And the people agreed saying, “‘Let’s start rebuilding,’ and their hands were strengthened to do this good work” (v.18).\nWhat exactly fueled Nehemiah’s faith? It was the Word of God. It was the authority behind his bold and seemingly insurmountable task of rebuilding the walls. But isn’t it true that when God calls His people to a task, it is God who makes His people prosper? He promises, and we respond. We can either respond in bold faith, trusting in Him, or we can respond in fear, shrinking back at the opposition in front of us.\nIn many ways, Nehemiah is a heroic figure whose courage and resolve serve as an example to bolster our faith. He shows us what it looks like to live by faith, trusting in God. This same God reveals Himself to us in His Word and in the person of Jesus Christ, and calls us to respond in faith and obedience. And in His sovereignty, He has the power and authority to bring about His good and perfect will.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    There is a holy sort of confidence that comes from knowing that you are working under God’s calling on your life. It’s not prideful or arrogant, and it’s certainly not a confidence that expresses itself in brash talk or seeks to put down others.  \nWe catch a glimpse of this holy confidence in the life of Nehemiah. For a myriad of socio-political reasons, Nehemiah’s undertaking should have been an impossible one. Power, money, and the dominant culture and thinking in his day would have surely been working against him in rebuilding Jerusalem. Yet Nehemiah set out with courage and passion because he knew the “gracious hand of God” was on his life, a fact that he mentions and remembers in his heart several times (Nehemiah 2:8). \nAll too often, we falter in our own missions because we forget or neglect the power of our calling. More than Artaxerxes’s commissioning, Nehemiah knew he had been sent out under the authority and presence of God. This gave him courage to be bold in his pursuit of God’s causes, and it also offered reassurance when he encountered resistance.\nWhen you go out this day, remember Who is sending you. Like Nehemiah, keep your focus fixed there—not on the problem or challenges in front of you, but on God’s power to change the unchangeable, to conquer the unconquerable, and to restore the unrestorable. \nFor those of you who already possess a deep sense of God’s calling and hand on your life, remember to steward it well. That holy confidence comes with divine expectations; it’s not a gift that you’re meant to wield for your own purposes or gain. In fact, Scripture is laced with examples of leaders who misused the influence of their calling. This repeatedly backfires, and usually carries with it a great deal of collateral damage. \nFor those of you who have lost your sense of calling, or perhaps are seeking it for the first time, take heart: Nehemiah’s mission came in the midst of some dire circumstances. Also, keep watch: God’s vision and mission for this season of life may look different from what you anticipated. When your spirit senses His commissioning, take hold of it and refuse to let it go, and rest assured that His gracious hand is on you.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

Yet in the midst of his shock and uncertainty for what lay ahead, my friend said that he felt strangely liberated. Losing all their worldly possessions meant his family was free to start over.\nIf you were given the opportunity to reboot your life, what would you do, and why? Would you work to recapture what was lost, or would you try to build something completely new and different? Would you try to become someone completely different?\nThis situation is where we meet Nehemiah. The Babylonian exiles have essentially burned life as his people knew it to the ground. The walls of Jerusalem lay in ruins hundreds of miles away. As the people of Judah surveyed their situation under Persian rule, they were essentially asking themselves: Who are we now, and what happens next? Do we try to go back, or is there no such thing as home anymore?\nFor Nehemiah, Jerusalem was more than a place. It was a symbol—a physical location on a map that pointed to a spiritual belonging. He and his people didn’t just belong to that city. They belonged to the God who had led them there so many years earlier. Their identity was tied to the temple of the Lord shining from that city on a hill in Zion. So when the opportunity to repair Jerusalem’s fallen walls became a possibility, Nehemiah prayed, “Please, Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant” (Nehemiah 1:11). Then he set his face like a flint toward home and went back to rebuild.\nAs you read the book of Nehemiah, remember that true belonging is about more than a physical place to store your stuff or lay your head. For the Christian, we are tied to the ancient story of God’s redeeming work, which has its roots all the way back in the fall of man in the Garden of Eden. Even if everything around us burns to the ground, we still have a home in the presence of God. Even more, we have an identity. We are His people, and that is something no exile, catastrophe, or war can threaten or change.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Think for a minute about the holidays people celebrate: Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, New Year’s Day, Passover, Independence Day. What do they all have in common? They all commemorate the beginning of a new era. To varying degrees, they all celebrate surviving the past and anticipating better days to come.\nThis word, holiday, is a simplifying of “holy day.” Holy days are days when we stand together before God and thank Him for His faithfulness. They are days when we take stock of the gravity of what we survived, and look ahead with hopeful eyes to a better future.\nThe book of Esther ends with the institution of a holiday called Purim. On Purim the Jewish people celebrated that Haman did not wipe them out. They remembered how God turned the tables on evil, and blessed them with peace. Jewish people still celebrate Purim today. Purim celebrations include reading Esther, giving to the poor, sharing a meal, and exchanging gifts. One common gift is a noisemaker called a “grager,” which is used to block out the name “Haman.”\nThe whole idea of this holiday is for the Jewish people to proclaim, “We’re still here!” Haman tried to blot them out, but he failed. Still, he tried. Tragically, this has been the Jewish people’s plight more than once. Both Pharaoh and Hitler sought to exterminate the Jews from the face of the earth. And they both failed too.\nPurim belongs in a similar category to Passover, the holiday when the Jewish people celebrate their deliverance from slavery in Egypt, and the more recent Jewish holiday Yom Ha’Shoah, the Day of Remembrance of the Holocaust, which carries the mantra “Never forget.”\nThese holidays are more than victory laps. They are serious business. Remembering is important to survival, to knowing where we come from, and to preventing atrocities from visiting later generations. Holy days remind us of just how fragile we are, and how hopeless we would be without God’s intervening hand.\nWhat happens in Esther foreshadows the cross. The possible extermination of the Jewish people is a dark part of Esther’s story. It is not something any of us should forget. We need to remember that great rescue follows great peril. As people who have been saved by grace through faith in Christ, Christians do well to remember what we have been saved from—death and eternal separation from God.\nOur salvation in Christ is no small thing. Just as the Jews in Esther’s time celebrated their deliverance from destruction, so do believers in Christ. We have not been delivered from the unjust lunacy of a tyrant. We have been delivered from the perfectly just wrath of a holy God. This is a heavy thought, I know. But it is also the point of the cross, by which we have been fully and forever set free.\nCelebrate your freedom in Christ by remembering what you have been saved from, and Who has saved you from it.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

My wife is spontaneous and doesn’t mind if we don’t even know where we will sleep tonight. But when I don’t know what’s coming, I go ahead and worry. \nI know what Scripture says about worry (don’t do it), but when things look bad and the unknowns pile up, I get in there and worry like a champ. I really get men like Peter. Remember him standing on the water, looking at the dark waves and starting to sink? Peter liked to know the facts, and standing on that water, the facts as he understood them didn’t add up (Mark 14:22-33).\nWhat I don’t like is not knowing. In other words, I’d rather not need to have faith. Of course, this desire for an easy and comfortable spiritual walk, where everything is clear up front and there is only good news, is not what God has designed. The good that God wants for us is not about our ease, but about growing us in Him. This means that the natural man, the one that doubts, frets, and despairs, has to go. In his place must grow a new man, who believes and gives thanks.\nEsther is a great book for “men of little faith” like myself. God’s name isn’t even mentioned. Take that at face value, and there is plenty of reason to worry and fret. But God often does His greatest work while no one is looking. Even in the midst of the night, and in the early morning hours, He prepares salvation for His people (Exodus 14:21; John 20:1). Take darkness at face value, and we miss seeing His hand at work. At the moment of defeat, He brings victory. In weakness, He is strength. From sorrow, He makes joy, and from death, life (Esther 9:22; John 5:24).\nThe thirteenth day of Adar was the moment of reversal. In the final hours, the tide turned. God sent to the Jews’ aid not only Mordecai, but the officials and satraps and governors of the provinces, and then caused the fear of the Jews to fall on all the people. When all was seemingly lost, suddenly, all was won. \nOne detail in particular stands out to me here: the Jews “laid no hands on the plunder” (Esther 9:16). Why not? When fate has dealt you a fortunate hand, why not capitalize on it? But the Jews did not. As Matthew Henry observed, the Jews refused the spoils “in imitation of their father Abraham, who scorned to enrich himself with the spoils of Sodom.” The riches of the earth, Abraham recognized, didn’t belong to men, but to God, and it was not the kingdoms of this earth that we are called to desire. Even when kingdoms fall into our hands, they are not ours for the taking.\nGod is a God of sudden reversals, and the only proper response is thanksgiving, expressed in restraint and generosity. May we be mindful of God’s work, even when it is hidden from our eyes. May we seek first His kingdom, leaning not on our own understanding, for the joy of the Lord is our strength!\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

On one hand, she knew all about Haman’s plot to destroy the Jews. It was not only an evil plot, but one against her own people. And as Mordecai pointed out, she would most likely not escape unscathed herself.\nBut to ask for help from the king was not so easy either. You didn’t just walk into the king’s court, asking questions and requesting favors. Doing so meant risking your life.\nBy the time we get to Esther 8, Haman’s plot has been seen for what it was and he has been hung instead of Mordecai. But King Ahasuerus has already signed off on the destruction of the Jews. The law is on the books and even though Haman has been dealt with, the law is the law.\nShe has to go to the king again. (I love this scene.) Esther goes to him…\n“Then Esther spoke again to the king. She fell at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to avert the evil plan of Haman the Agagite and the plot that he had devised against the Jews” (Esther 8:3).\nIt would be hard to not be moved by Esther’s bravery and love for her people. Her willingness to face death instead of simply enjoying the glory she had as the queen is admirable. She models the kind of heroic life we enjoy watching on the big screen. We hope to be like Esther and we name our daughters after her because of her sacrificial life.\nBut ultimately this story is not about Esther. It is a story about the God who saves His people. And as beautiful as this story is, we enjoy a salvation even greater. \nThink about what Christ has done. Instead of simply enjoying the glory that was His, He emptied Himself of that glory and bravely came to save us in love. Just as Esther wept and pleaded for the Jews, Jesus intercedes for us even now (Romans 8:34). The salvation we enjoy because of the work of Christ, does not merely save us from physical death; it turns death back on itself, so that now even death is defeated. This can only move us toward eternal life.\nThe Jews had the schemes of Haman. We have the schemes of Satan and our sinful flesh. Christ has defeated our great enemy. Just as Esther intervened to save the Jews who were once under the condemnation of the king, we, too, are saved and no longer under condemnation (Romans 8:31). \nWritten by Matthew B.

Comeuppance means someone receives the fate they deserve. That’s what today’s story is about, or at least it is in part.\nThe conniving, self-aggrandizing, malicious Haman is finally outed for his plot to destroy the Jews. In a carefully planned and desperate maneuver, Esther invites Haman and King Ahasuerus to a banquet. Because she finds favor with the king, he offers whatever her heart desires, and Esther’s response is not at all what Ahasuerus anticipated—not riches, not fame, not ease. “Spare my life; this is my request. And spare my people; this is my desire” (Esther 7:3).\nThis moment is the hinge on which the story turns. How will the king respond? He is outraged and demands to know who is perpetrating this atrocity. Esther, patient and wise, had waited to reveal this, knowing she needed the king to believe her before she played her final card. “This evil Haman,” declares the queen. And the door slams shut.\nHaman is hanged, in a stroke of providential and poetic irony, on the gallows he had built to kill Mordecai. (I suppose this would be the original gallows humor.) And this, friends, is the perfect comeuppance—a satisfying end for a mastermind of genocide.\nBut this story is about more than good triumphing over evil and a villain getting what he deserves. Those elements of the narrative are meant to resonate with something more and draw our attention to greater themes: the justice of God, His care for His people, and His judgment of evil. \nPsalm 91 describes how God is the refuge of those who trust Him and will deliver them from “the bird trap” (v.3). Revelation 20 describes God’s judgment seat where no one will be passed over and all will be judged for their actions in this life (vv.11-12). Throughout Scripture, we read that God hates sin, loves mercy, upholds justice, stands by the weak, and will never forsake His people. \nThe book of Esther tells the tale of a rescuing God who pulls no punches in upholding justice on behalf of His people. That is how stories are supposed to work. They draw us into events and lives where we see and feel what injustice, fear, hope, and rescue feel like. They show us evil and they show us good. And they give color and light to the lessons the rest of Scripture teaches about who God is and why we can trust Him. \nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    So much of life seems so very unfair. Why do those who do what is right often seem to suffer so much, or fail to be justly rewarded for what they have done? And, why do those who do wrong so often seem to prosper? These questions have plagued mankind throughout all of human history. Thankfully, Scripture deals with that question head on. The book of Esther, in particular, teaches us that God superintends history in such a way that He is working out His plan in the lives of His people and exercising His sovereignty over the wicked. In the end, God’s mysterious purposes will stand and He will ultimately mete out justice. \nC.S. Lewis once noted that ultimately God will “work backwards and turn… agony into a glory.” We see this principle typified in God’s dealings with Mordecai. By way of contrast, we see God turning against Haman—the one who sought to destroy the people of God and, by way of implication, the promise of redemption in the coming Christ.\nThroughout the better part of this grand narrative, Mordecai seems to have been forgotten and Haman seems to be prospering. But as we come to the end of the story, we see Mordecai, who had acted with uprightness in all his dealings, rewarded for his faithfulness and Haman overthrown for his wickedness. \nWhen he is finally remembered for uncovering a plot against the king, Mordecai is honored—ironically—by the very one who sought to destroy him and his people. The king made Haman clothe Mordecai with the royal robes and parade him through the city on one of the his own horses. This was the ultimate vindication from God. As Proverbs 26 teaches, “The one who digs a pit will fall into it” (v.27). No greater display of God’s superintendence in the lives of His people could have been shown.\nThis is, of course, a picture in redemptive history, a foretaste of the victory that God gives Jesus over Satan. Though the evil one thought that he had destroyed the Son of God on the cross, it was actually the means of ultimate victory and redemption. In the resurrection, God the Father proudly presents His Son before the watching world to see His ultimate purposes of grace and triumph.\nAll those who are trusting in Christ will also know ultimate vindication and triumph. No matter what we endure in this life, Scripture makes clear that there is a day in which every wrong will be made right, and everyone who has schemed against the Lord and His people will be destroyed. That is the ultimate confidence we have as we make our way through this seemingly unjust world of sin and death. There is an overthrow of all wickedness through the death and resurrection of Jesus. \nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Sometimes the road we’re on looks dark. What do we do when it seems God is leading us down that road?\nShortly after their occupation of Poland, Nazi Germany began arresting and incarcerating Polish political prisoners at a camp in the southern Polish town of Auschwitz. One year later, in September 1940, a Polish resistance fighter named Witold Pilecki inserted himself into a Nazi round-up of Poles on the streets of Warsaw. Pilecki, like most Poles, knew that Auschwitz was more than a typical prison camp, but no one knew exactly what the Nazis were doing there. He had to find out.\nPilecki was voluntarily incarcerated at Auschwitz for two years, facing almost certain death, before he overpowered a guard in the middle of the night and escaped in order to inform the world of the Nazi atrocities he witnessed. Pilecki demonstrated tremendous courage in the face of danger for the sake of what was good. He had to enter into the darkness, and trust that the Nazis were too proud to suspect anyone would volunteer to do what he had done.\nWhen Queen Esther approached King Ahasuerus in the inner court of his palace, she demonstrated a similar measure of courage. She risked her life to save her people. For, if one entered the inner court of a king without the gold scepter of the king first being extended to them, execution would surely follow. This was true even for a queen. Yet, Esther needed to approach the king in order to advance her plot to expose Haman—a vizier of the king who intended to exterminate the Jews in Persia—as a traitor to King Ahasuerus.\nAs you read for yourself what happens next, one of the things you see in this story, along with Esther’s courage, is how intoxicating pride can be. Haman was blinded by it, and so often we are too. Proverbs 16:18 says, “Pride comes before destruction, and an arrogant spirit before a fall.” God, in His providence, directed the heart of the king to accept Esther’s request and led Haman to joyfully construct gallows that would eventually lead to his own undoing. \nThe Lord was working in Esther’s crisis. That thought never even occurred to Haman. Esther, on the other hand, had no choice but to trust that God was present and to humbly follow where He led, even though the way seemed dark.\nThe humility and pride on display in this book serve as a warning, redirecting our hearts to Christ. Jesus entered our darkness and exposed it to the light by humbling Himself to the point of death. But from that death came our salvation, which reminds us that God is always working. May the Lord give us the eyes of humility to see this and the courage to follow where He leads, even when the way seems dark. It is not dark to Him (Psalm 139:12).\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

An older boy is pushing, taunting, and hitting this younger lad. The bully starts hitting his victim with his own shoes, pushing him into the shoe cabinet over and over. Time to put my Icedream cone down. \nI march in. “Hey! Quit it!” The bully and I lock eyes. He wonders if he can do anything to me. He can only say, “You aren’t my dad. You can’t tell me what to do.” He’s right. So, I told him the truth. “You’re right. But I can find your dad and tell him what you are doing to this kid.” Justice was served. His dad heard the news.\nI felt pretty good about myself driving home. While I stood up for a helpless little boy, my actions didn’t cost me much. My ice cream melted a little. But real heroics are costly.\nMordecai hears about Haman’s sinister plan for the Jewish people, and he knows Esther has to do something. She’s the only one who can get to the king. She can stand up for the helpless. And as a Jew, she herself is in danger too.\nDo you resonate with Mordecai’s humility here? He doesn’t force the issue and try to be the hero. He recognizes someone else is better suited for what must be done. Instead of trying to be the hero, he encourages Esther, the one who’s been placed in the position of influence. I wonder who is on the brink of doing great and faithful things for God but only needs a little of our encouragement.\nEsther agrees with Mordecai, even though she may perish by approaching the king. But this doesn’t stop her. “If I perish, I perish,” she says (Esther 4:16). If she helps to save God’s people, even at her own personal expense, she will do it. \nSacrifice and risk for redemption are at the heart of the gospel. Do you humbly see who your hero is? The one who accomplished what you couldn’t?\nBrothers, Jesus is the true and better Esther. His heroics were costly. He perished to redeem us curse-bound people. He gave up His breath for us, in our place, on the cross, paying for our sins. He perished so that we would “never perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16). But He didn’t stay in perish-mode. He rose again, conquering the curse, and today lives as the King of kings. \nRejoice in your Redeemer! \nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    As I write this, images of human hatred and bigotry flash across news outlets—the type of deep-seated hatred that often spills into deadly violence. As I have watched these events unfold, I’ve fought back tears of anger. I’ve also experienced a strange sense of déjà vu, a poignant reminder that things are still not as they should be. \nThe images in our news outlets look eerily familiar to the narratives of biblical history. This chapter of Esther reminds me that such conflicts are nothing new. Even Haman the Agagite’s plot to destroy Mordecai and the Jews mirrors the ancient conflict between these two people groups. The tension is only heightened as Ahasuerus, the king of the Amalekites—ancient enemies of the Jews (Exodus 17:8-16)—is brought into the picture. \nThis helps us understand Mordecai’s refusal to bow down to Haman. Bowing was was normal protocol for a king’s official, but it would have jeopardized Mordecai’s conscience as a God-fearing Jew. \nMordecai’s refusal to bow was the prime opportunity for Haman to finally destroy the Jews living in the kingdom of Ahasuerus, something he had been plotting for years. As the story unfolds, the imminent massacre of God’s people seems inevitable. As Haman and the king await the outpouring of Jewish blood, they celebrate by pouring one another drinks. \nFrom our perspective it often seems like evil has won the day. Nevertheless, narratives like this remind us that our omniscient God will have the final say. “The lot is cast into the lap [of man], but its every decision is from the LORD” (Proverbs 16:33). \nHaman’s authorized exchange, silver for the slaughter of God’s people, is ironically similar to the Gospel accounts of authorities exchanging silver for the slaughter of God’s only Son. Haman and the king may have rejoiced over Israel’s supposed destruction. Satan may have rejoiced at the supposed destruction of God’s Son. However, “Our God is a God of salvation, and to God, the Lord, belong deliverances from death” (Psalm 68:20). \nThis is the great irony of God’s grace and providence. Evil people plot and plan, but history is guided by God’s providential hand (Isaiah 55:8–9). In fact, all of human history finds its resolve in the cross and resurrection of the Son of God, where good triumphs over evil. It doesn’t matter if we are looking back into ancient history or weeping over the weekend’s news, our God is good. His gospel is sure. When Christ returns, every evil plot will be foiled. Things will finally be as they should be.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    God sees us as we truly are. Because we are made in His image, we all have inherent value and dignity. This is where our true worth comes from.\nWe live in a culture that cares more about superficial, surface-level beauty, and putting on a front for others, than it does for truth and authenticity. You might not be surprised to know that this has existed throughout human history. Ever since Adam and Eve traded their perfect relationship with God in order to try to be something else (Genesis 3), we have never been happy with our own identities in our Creator God.\nIn today’s passage, we see this working itself out in King Ahasuerus. He treats women like possessions, and because he’s king he can have whatever he pleases. When we meet this king, he is not a decent man. He is concerned only about himself and his reputation. He treats people as property for his own pleasure. He has no interest in leading his nation to worship and glorify the Lord.\nKing Ahasuerus is consumed with superficiality. We see this in the way he goes about choosing a new queen. The criterion for becoming his queen is built entirely on physical beauty, so much so that the king makes sure the women being groomed for his court are receiving extensive beauty treatments. \nEsther was not technically in line to become queen because of her ethnicity. However, she obviously stood out in the crowd, gaining “favor in the eyes of everyone who saw her” (Esther 2:15). Initially, this had a lot to do with how she looked. But she had so much more than superficial beauty. As we read further we see she also had wisdom, compassion, and courage. The king did not see these things in her at first. But they were there, and he would see them soon.\nThe problem with living in a superficial culture is that we fail to see below the surface to the truth. Regardless of whether our lives look perfect to the world, or if we stand out in the crowd like Esther did, we are all valued children of God. We gain favor in God’s eyes simply by being His image bearers (Genesis 1:26). \nOur true King sees us as we really are, regardless of our outer beauty. Jesus Christ, the Man of Sorrows who was despised and rejected and who had no splendor about Him (Isaiah 53), has shown us our worth by how He has redeemed us. He did not look for our outer beauty and then choose to love us based on how beautiful we appeared. Instead, He saw our sinful hearts and chose to lay down His own life in order to make us co-heirs of the enduring kingdom of God (Romans 8:16-17).\nPraise God that our King is nothing like Ahasuerus, and we don’t need to have the splendor of Esther to be noticed and valued by Him.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

And I always feel a certain responsibility to make sure they remedy this oversight in their lives. Why? Because The Princess Bride is a perfect story—one where nothing is wasted. It has everything: pirates, sword fighting, giants, power struggles, true love, and rodents of unusual size. Everything.\nI don’t know if you know this or not, but the Old Testament book of Esther is also a perfect story. It, too, has everything. A proud king. A defiant queen. An assassination plot. An ambitious, venomous second-in-command. And a seventy-five foot tall gallows going up in the heart of town, built especially for the sage-like guardian of the beautiful orphan girl who would become queen of the land. The book of Esther tells quite a tale.\nThis historical book tells the story of a king and a kingdom. On its surface, we see a kingdom of this world as we read about Ahasuerus and his rule over Persia. But the true story runs much deeper and higher. Even though God is not mentioned by name in this book, He is the supreme king and hero of this story. His providential hand leads His people from certain destruction to the kind of safety found only in being the object of a king’s affection.\nToday’s reading sets the stage by casting an ominous shadow over a seemingly happy time of feasting and abundance. The king throws a party meant to last for 180 days, but when he summons his queen so that he might show off her beauty to his guests, she refuses to come to him. The queen’s refusal to obey her king reverberates throughout the kingdom and the old saying, “As it goes for the king, so it goes for the kingdom,” comes into play. The king’s embarrassment becomes a moment of weakness the power-hungry seek to exploit, kicking the rest of the story into motion.\nAs you read Esther, enjoy the twists and turns. Appreciate the irony laced throughout. Feel the fear and trembling Mordecai, Esther, and their people must have known as Haman’s gallows took shape. The story itself deserves our appreciation for its complexity, drama, romance, and outcome.\nBut remember that a story like this points to an even bigger truth. The Apostle Paul describes this truth as God’s ability to use what is seemingly insignificant and despised in the world to shame that which the world exalts over God (1 Corinthians 1:27-29).  \nThe book of Esther is a double-edged sword. It is a rebuke to those who are tempted to scheme and plot their way to greatness. But it is also a story of reassurance that no matter how powerful the schemes of man may appear, God can topple them in a moment with ease. May that sword cut you both ways for the glory of God.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

As Laurin likes to say, “Free football!” I usually say something like, “We’ve entered overtime all tied up, making the previous four quarters utterly meaningless.” I’m joking, of course, but there’s a bit of truth to my logic. Every single game starts out with a tie—the score is always zero to zero—and if a game continues into overtime, it’s tied up again. It’s like both teams have to start all over.\nReading this last chapter of Job can feel a bit like this. Since Job’s health and finances are restored and he’s blessed with ten more children, the state of things at the end of the story is much the same as it was at the beginning. Did any of the chapters in between even matter? What was the point?\nWe might be tempted to think that the point has something to do with justice. After all, Job was righteous, so it’s only fair that everything he lost should be restored. But this was Job’s logic for most of the book. God, in His response to Job’s complaints, never suggests that Job is “owed” anything. Instead, He asks, “Who is this who obscures my counsel with ignorant words?” (Job 38:2) and “Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him?” (40:2). Job, in his accumulated wisdom, says in the end, “I reject my words and am sorry for them; I am dust and ashes” (42:6). As much as we’d like to turn the book of Job into a fairy tale with an obvious moral and a “happily ever after,” we are never invited to do so.\nJob’s fortunes are not returned to him because he did the right thing and earned God’s favor. (He hadn’t lost it in the first place.) There is nothing in the book to suggest that when we experience suffering we, too, can turn our luck around by following three easy steps. Nothing of the sort. Rather, Job is restored because of God’s grace, pure and simple. Job was right in the beginning when he said, “The LORD gives, and the LORD takes away” (1:21). God is God—and He is free to deal with us as He chooses, as scary as that may seem. But the truth of the matter is, we are all recipients of God’s amazing grace.\nThis grace is seen most vibrantly in Jesus, through whom His followers have received “every spiritual blessing in the heavens” (Ephesians 1:3). In Job, we catch a glimpse of this outpouring. Chapter 42 does not bring us into an overtime quarter where the score is essentially reset. Instead, notice that the numbers of sheep, goats, camels, oxen, and donkeys at the end of the book are twice what they were at the beginning (compare 42:12 with 1:3). In addition, Job is blessed with ten new children, ostensibly doubling the number of children he will have in eternity. Even Job’s long life—140 years—is twice the typical lifespan noted by Moses in Psalm 90:10.\nThe doubling of Job’s blessings is not meant to be a commentary on the man’s righteous standing before God. Instead, it is meant to show us that the God who commands the morning and knows when the mountain goats give birth is also the God who loves His children lavishly (38:12, 39:1). We cannot begin to count the blessings that are ours because of Jesus. In fact, “What no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no human heart has conceived—God has prepared these things for those who love him” (1 Corinthians 2:9).\nJob is a book about the cup of suffering we all drink in one season or another, but it is also a book about God’s love, a love that overflows our cups and fills the oceans.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

Would you ask about a certain situation in your life—why something is the way it is? Would you ask Him to explain some great mystery of the universe, or something more personal but mundane?\nFor Job, the one question in his mind was simply “Why?” Why had God permitted so much terrible suffering into his life? Why was there so much heartache and pain when he had endeavored to live a righteous life? We might find these to be fair, even noble, questions, but the posture of Job’s heart wasn’t humility; it was pride. In Job’s mind, God owed him an answer. What Job really wanted was to correct and rebuke God.\nPerhaps you’re in a difficult situation right now. Maybe you feel you’ve been wrongly treated by God, and He needs to answer for it. God’s reply in chapters 40 and 41 is a helpful response to someone who thinks he knows better than God. He points to two massive, untamable, dangerous creatures—the Behemoth and the Leviathan—and asks Job if he can capture or tame them. Can Job manipulate or contain the strongest and most fierce of all of God’s creatures? Can you?\nThe obvious answer is “no.” God declares, “No one is ferocious enough to rouse Leviathan; who then can stand against me?” (Job 41:10). God’s direct question to Job is really rhetorical, “Would you really challenge my justice? Would you declare me guilty to justify yourself?” (Job 40:8). Again, the answer is a definite “no.”\nWhat God wants us to see is that while there are circumstances and events in our lives that may seem unjust, the Lord is never wrong in how He chooses to act. He doesn’t owe us answers. What we need to remember is that His care for us does not disappear in the midst of suffering.\nEven while enduring the anguish of the cross, Jesus did not abandon us in the midst of our greatest need. If He died to deliver us from our sin, He certainly won’t abandon us in lesser afflictions.\nTo follow Jesus is to accept the invitation to trust Him. This is what faith is: trusting God, even in the midst of storms and trials. While we may not understand our circumstances or why they’ve occurred, God is still just, and His purposes in our lives are always for our good and His glory. So when we find ourselves in hardships again, maybe we shouldn’t ask, “Why, God?” Maybe we should ask less and listen more. Then we might be able to hear Him say, “Do you trust Me?”\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    This is the moment we’ve been waiting for in this study: God has finally come to talk with Job. But where we might have expected God to start explaining His overarching purposes for Job’s suffering, God takes a different approach. Instead of standing as the defendant, answering for His actions, God takes on the role of the prosecutor. Turns out God has some questions He wants answered. What God does in Job 38–39 is lay out the scope of creation, asking Job what part he had in making it all happen. Effectively, God puts Job in his place.\nBefore we get to the reason why God takes this approach with Job, we might do well to consider these chapters as a testimonial to the unbridled greatness of God in creating all things. We gain a better perspective on ourselves and our issues when we consider the realities of creation fashioned by the Creator’s hand.\nFrom the size and movement of our planet to the boundaries of the vast ocean waters, we see God’s hand at work in things we cannot comprehend (Job 38:12–15). From the heights of the stars to the depths of the lowest trench, we are left to ponder the expansive work of God (v.16–21). At God’s instruction, the wildest creatures in the animal kingdom are perfectly cared for and ordered, all without a bit of help from us (ch. 39).\nFor the most part, we live without an awareness of our place in the grand scheme of creation. We believe and behave as if we rule the universe. We act as though we possess wisdom enough to determine what is good and fair. But if we allow the untamable realities of God’s creation to shape us, we’ll see we aren’t as great or wise as we thought we were.\nWith untethered appraisals of ourselves, we can grow pretty confident. And yet, in comprehending the discretionary power of God in the whole of nature, we’re left with no choice but to acknowledge we’re not as brilliant or powerful as we thought. God’s question, “Who put wisdom in the heart or gave the mind understanding?” leads us to realize our limitations in the sight of our Creator (Job 38:36).\nAnd this is right where we should be. Jesus said the kingdom of heaven requires us to become like children (Matthew 18:3), not theologians. So how do we get there? Perhaps a little time spent outdoors, considering the vastness of the natural world around us would be a start. There in the silence, we might learn how to listen to God, to ask Him about His creation and His ways. Indeed the heavens declare His glory. May we learn to praise Him and worship Him for who He is and all He has done.\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    “What is God trying to teach you in all of this?” That question rang in my head as I listened to a friend talk me through one of the darkest seasons of my life. To be slandered and lied about was deeply difficult, and deeply wrong. My friend’s question bothered me because I didn’t want to learn anything in that moment; I simply wanted vindication.\nIn my suffering, I was taking the attitude of Job. His posture showed that he believed God should answer for the apparent injustice that had befallen him. God should take the stand as the defendant and give an answer for why He had treated “righteous” Job so poorly.\nBut Elihu suggests another posture. When faced with suffering and hardship, our hearts should not rise up and require an answer from God for the apparent injustice we’re facing. Rather, we should look to God, assuming that our current suffering is due to His justice. In this way, we may be corrected, turn, and do what is right.\nElihu points Job to the mystery of God’s perfect power and justice in all that He does, calling him to humility rather than arrogant demands for an answer. Elihu’s logic for this kind of perspective comes from the powerful work of God in creation. God powerfully and righteously sends down rain to benefit the land, but also to blessed those whom He loves and punish the wicked (Job 37:13). The trouble is, we’re not wise enough, nor do we possess enough knowledge to be able to discern fully which is which. “Do you know how God directs his clouds or makes their lightning flash?” (v.15). Our entitlement of heart leads us to believe that when God thunders, He’d better give an answer to us as to why He thundered.\nElihu shares two things with us: First, God is perfect in His justice and power. And second, we aren’t all-knowing. We will never understand God’s ways perfectly; therefore, we must be humble before Him (v.23–24). We must remember that our God does great things that we cannot possibly comprehend (v.5).\nAt first, His work might not make much sense to us, which is exactly why we must humbly embrace the foolishness of the cross. Jesus’s death was the greatest injustice in the history of humanity, and yet it was the place where God’s justice and mercy met. When we are tempted to puff out our chests and demand an answer from God, we would do well to remember He has already given humanity an answer. He spoke loudly and clearly of His love, justice, power, and mercy at Calvary.\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    At some point, every Christian will doubt the goodness of God. We all walk through periods of pain, darkness, or loss that can make us wonder if God loves us, if He cares about us, and if He will keep His promises to us. It should not surprise us when this happens, but we need to know what is true so we can preach to ourselves in our doubts and pain.\nIn his classic book Spiritual Depression, Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones suggests that many of our worst problems come when we listen to ourselves instead of talk to ourselves. He offers the example of Psalm 42, where the psalmist says, “Why, my soul, are you so dejected?” (v.5). Lloyd-Jones’s point is that if we only listen to ourselves, we will continually doubt God’s goodness. But if we preach truth to ourselves, we will begin to see our faith in God’s promises reaffirmed.\nToday’s readings give us good news to preach to ourselves. As Elihu continues his speech, he points to an essential truth about God, one we all must remember. He says, “But when God is silent, who can declare him guilty? When he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he watches over both individuals and nations” (Job 34:29).\nGod’s silence does not mean that He is indifferent to our suffering. Our not sensing His presence does not mean He has abandoned us. Elihu’s declaration is true: the providential hand of God is always in operation, even when we do not necessarily see it at work.\nDavid helps us to remember this through his words in Psalm 28. He begins his prayer by asking the Lord to hear him instead of remaining deaf to his cries. He begs the Lord to listen to him. Then halfway through the psalm, he blesses the Lord, saying, “He has heard the sound of my pleading” (v.6).\nYou might wonder how David could ask God to hear him, to not ignore him—then turn around to say that he is confident God truly does hear him. The answer is found in David’s statement in verse seven: “The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped.” David trusted in the Lord. He believed God’s Word, and was certain of His power to save and deliver him.\nOur hard times can be disorienting. When we are facing a job loss, sickness, divorce, depression, or a wayward child, we may struggle to know who we are and what is real. This is why we need to remind ourselves of the truth in these dark nights of the soul. We must remember that God loves us and is for us. We must be convinced in the depths of our hearts that God does not take us through the fire to burn us, but instead to refine us.\nIf you are in the furnace of affliction today, take heart. Your God loves you. Your God is with you. Your God will not leave you or forsake you. Hold on to that today.\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    These days, we suffer no lack of would-be coaches and advisors. While everyone needs mentors and trusted confidants, we could foolishly fill our days with coaching sessions and online courses from self-styled experts who believe they can help us with everything from our spiritual lives to our physical fitness. And that doesn’t include all of the free “counsel” we receive via social media.\nIn a world of unsolicited advice, today’s readings remind us where we can find genuine wisdom. We should all be thankful Job’s friends didn’t have Twitter accounts. After Bildad, Zophar, and Eliphaz go back and forth with Job in a conversation that seems to go nowhere, the young Elihu steps into the fray.\nInitially, Elihu is “timid and afraid” to speak to Job, assuming the other men’s words would be wiser because they are older. But after witnessing their conversation, Elihu changes his mind, declaring, “It is the spirit in a person—the breath from the Almighty—that gives anyone understanding” (Job 32:8). The word Elihu uses for “spirit” can refer to wind, breath, the spirit within a person, or the Holy Spirit. Since Elihu speaks about a “breath from the Almighty,” we can assume he means that genuine wisdom comes from the Holy Spirit, from God Himself.\nSolomon echoed Elihu’s words when he said to his son, “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not rely on your own understanding” (Proverbs 3:5). Solomon recognized that human beings are naturally foolish and easily led astray. Instead of trusting in our fallen reasoning and intuition, we ought to seek wisdom from the Lord.\nThe Spirit reveals the Lord’s wisdom to us in a number of ways, but especially through Scripture. We make the most progress in godly wisdom when we are consistently reading God’s Word. In fact, we cannot and will not grow in wisdom without it. As we immerse ourselves in the Bible and submit to its teaching, the Lord trains our minds and shapes our character.\nWe also grow in wisdom from the Spirit as we walk alongside our Christian brothers, especially those of mature faith. What God has worked in their lives can be passed on as a blessing to us. In God’s kind providence, we don’t have to walk through the Christian life alone.\nDo you lack wisdom? Then seek the Lord. In James 1, we’re told we can ask Him for wisdom, and He will bestow it freely (v.5). Through His Spirit, the Lord keeps that promise to us over and over again.\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Recently, I came across a magazine article that examined the growing epidemic of suicide among young men. It reported that three-quarters of the suicides in Britain were committed by men. The article referenced a poll where one-third of people between the ages of 35 and 44 said that, at some point in the past year, they had felt like life was not worth living.\nMany men suffer and don’t bring their pain out into the light of day. The pain can be compounded for Christian men who read commands in the Bible like “Rejoice in the Lord always!” (Philippians 4:4) while their lives are characterized by sorrow. The difficulties can become unbearable when we look back and remember times of joy but don’t know how to get there again.\nIn our reading today, Job descends into greater despair as he suffers from his losses and defends his righteousness against the attacks of his friends. He points to others who found themselves in similar situations and asks, “Have I not wept for those who have fallen on hard times? Has my soul not grieved for the needy?” He’d sympathized and wept with those who struggled, but now when he’d “hoped for good” in his own life, “evil came” to him instead (Job 30:25–26).\nPsalm 42 reveals a writer in mourning. The psalmist looks back on times when he’d rejoiced with others, leading them in procession to the house of God for worship (v.4). Yet when he wrote this particular psalm, he was “dejected,” “in turmoil,” and “depressed.”\nThe psalmist longs to appear before God, thirsting after Him like a deer panting after flowing streams. He addresses his own soul, reminding himself to hope in God once again. As for Job, he appeals to God for vindication, knowing that he stands no chance of absolving himself before the accusations of his so-called friends.\nThen, there is Jesus. On the cross, echoing the words of Psalm 22, he cries, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” (Matthew 27:46). From the perspective of every person standing there that day, He has been abandoned by God. Yet, three days later He will rise again. The world sees an abandoned man, but the Father vindicates His Son through His resurrection.\nIn the same way, our sorrow and our enemies do not speak the last word about us. Jesus Christ bore our sins in His own body on the tree, then rose from the dead so that we might be brought into right relationship with God. Christian, your pain does not define you. Your depression, your struggles, and the accusations of those who hate you have no bearing on what is truest about you. You are defined by your Savior, who loved you and gave Himself up for you.\nIn your trials, follow the example of the psalmist and speak to your own soul, remind yourself of what’s true. Say to yourself, “Why, my soul, are you so dejected? Why are you in such turmoil? Put your hope in God, for I will still praise him, my Savior and my God.”\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I absolutely love how Job 28 opens, with Job recounting the amazing ingenuity of human beings. We mine the metals in the earth and use them to carve pathways where there were none before. We use fire to light up the darkness and bake bread out of plants that sprout up from the ground. We separate the common from the precious, we make the rough world ornate and functional. And this was from the perspective of a man who lived thousands of years ago.\nSince then, we have invented microchips, airplanes, satellite communications, buildings that punch through the clouds, submarines that touch the ocean floor, and the supercomputers we call phones most of us are carrying around in our pockets and purses. We are a creative, intuitive, brilliant species when you get right down to it.\nBut intelligence, or the capacity to invent, does not translate into wisdom. Wisdom does not come from ingenuity. It does not come from mere intellect. It does not originate from within. Wisdom comes from God. It belongs to God. Wisdom exists because of God; it is tied directly to His character and His design for creation.\nMaybe there are times in your life when you can relate to Job—things are happening to you that you can’t explain and wish would end. But they are beyond your control. You’re left to endure, to pass through whatever your storm happens to be, hoping and praying for relief. What do you do in those situations?\nJob’s friends tried to bring reason to Job’s situation. Their prevailing wisdom was that Job must have caused his own suffering, and if he could only be wise enough to discern (or humble enough to confess) what he had done, he would find a way out. But Job reminds us that wisdom comes from being able to see a situation clearly, from a multitude of angles—and only God possesses perfect wisdom.\nGod understands the way to wisdom,\nand he knows its location.\nFor he looks to the ends of the earth\nand sees everything under the heavens (Job 28:23–24).\nOnly God possesses perfect wisdom. What does this mean for those of us who cannot see everything under the heavens? It means wisdom, for us, looks like seeking to see things with as much breadth as possible, and humbly acknowledging that there are aspects of such matters we may never grasp in this life. It also means trusting that even when we cannot see or discern as much as we might like, God is working all things according to the good of those who love Him and are called according to His purpose (Romans 8:28).\nThanks be to God for this, especially when our search for wisdom leads us to conclude that there is much we cannot see.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When I was in 7th grade, I had a math teacher who would send kids who caused trouble into the hall for the remainder of class. It looked awesome, and I wanted to go out there. So one day, when the teacher stepped out of the room, a bunch of kids got out of their seats to goof off. I did not. But when the teacher came back into the room, he said, “Anyone who was up while I was away, go out into the hall.” Though I had not gotten up, he didn’t know that. So I took advantage of the opportunity and went, by myself, into the hallway.\nA few minutes later, he came out into the hall and took me down to the principal’s office to get paddled (this was a different era). And I had to take it without objection because though I knew I had not sinned in the way he thought, I also knew what I’d done was far from right.\nIn today’s text, Bildad argues that no man is righteous. Okay, Job says, “fair enough. But God’s mercy is unsearchable. Whatever Bildad thinks Job has done, he hasn’t. Job knows God measures righteousness perfectly, and Job’s hope lies not in being sinless, but in God’s mercy.\nHow do we, as sinful people, live rightly before God? Yes, we try to conduct ourselves in a manner worthy of the grace we’ve been shown. But Job shows us something more here—something profound in its simplicity. He studies God. How can we live rightly before God? Study Him. Learn His ways. How does He listen to His people? How does He feed us and clothe us? How does He defend us against the wicked? How does He restore us to Himself? We read His Word, learn His ways, and then cling to them when everything else falls apart around us.\nRather than pulling away from God in times of affliction, Job draws near. He meditates on the character and acts of God. Even though Job cannot understand why God has allowed such calamity to come upon him, he resolves to maintain his integrity before the Lord by honoring His holy name.\nWe’re getting deep into this book, and maybe you’re feeling a bit of fatigue from some of the repetition. As you read these chapters, look at how Job studies not his own affliction, but the God he loves. He clings to the One who made him, even if He’s also the One who permitted Job’s affliction. As Job says, “What is the hope of the godless” (Job 27:8)? Look for the through-line of Job’s hope. It’s there, and it’s in God’s character.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Have you ever gotten into an argument with someone, and then argued the disputed matter until you were so weary that you lost the will to fight? Maybe a late-night conflict with a spouse, or a misstep with a co-worker. You go round and round, use all your words, state and restate your case, listen and re-listen to the other person’s position. But in the end, you just set the conflict down because it doesn’t seem to have a resolution.\nThat’s where we find Job and his friends. They have moved into a level of debate that has left Job weary to the bone. They’re getting nowhere in terms of trying to crack the code on his suffering. Did he do something wrong? If so, what? What else could it possibly be? Job says he’s tired of arguing (Job 23:2–3).\nStill, Eliphaz argues that Job’s suffering must come as a result of something he’s done wrong, which raises the question: Do our works—both bad and good—matter to God, and if so, how? There’s a part of me that would like it if the moral to the story was that Job did bad things, so God punished him. Then we’d have the tidy morality tale that says God protects “good people” from suffering and really lets “bad people” have it.\nBut the Bible isn’t a morality tale. It is a love story. So the question about whether our works matter to God is complex. We’re getting it backward if we think God’s blessings flow from our behavior. It’s the other way around. Our behavior is meant to be a response to God’s mercy.\nRomans 8:1 tells us there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ, meaning, when our faith is in Him, we cannot be condemned by our bad works, not even by ourselves. And yet Galatians 6:7–10 tells us to care about our conduct because it reflects a Spirit-filled life. Of course our good works matter to God. But they have no power to save us. God cares about our conduct because our conduct reflects the degree to which we understand the depth of His love for us. \nThe gospel says that because of Christ, believers will never pay for a single sin. God has already accepted full payment in the sacrifice of Christ. To demand two payments would be both unnecessary and unjust. \nOur works matter to God because He chooses to work through His people—often in spite of our shortcomings, and often through our seasons of affliction and limitation. Serving the Lord through our good works brings Him joy because it means we are cooperating with His love and mercy; we are living as His ambassadors of grace in a world that needs it. \nWe do not obey to get love. We obey in response to the mercy we’ve been shown. May we never reverse that equation.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Scan the most popular podcasts and streaming series on Netflix, and you’ll find a common thread: justice. People are interested in cold cases and unsolved murders, because they want justice to have its day. In our right minds, we want justice for all. God does too. But God also wants mercy to have its day. And like Jonah after him, Job is making a wrong turn at the fork in the road.\nJob looks at his life and then looks down the street at the God-haters as they clink their glasses and settle in for another lavish feast, enjoying their lives. Job is perplexed. He wonders, “Why do the wicked continue to live, growing old and becoming powerful?” (Job 21:7). In other words, “Why do they get to keep on living and thriving? Bring down the judgment, Lord!” Job scoffs at the sinners down the street because his vision is being narrowed by his own unrelenting suffering. He is beginning to forget what is true of God, and His doubts are starting to bubble to the surface. Trials have a way of shaking us, so that what we really believe deep down spills out.\nSo, what about Job’s questions? Why do the wicked continue to live? Why doesn’t God just wipe them out already? Because God is compassionate, merciful, gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in faithful love (Exodus 34:6). Or, as Peter tells us, God is patient with sinners, just like He was and is with us, because He doesn’t want any to perish but all to come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). The wicked who prospered in Job’s day may not have been suffering with poverty or scraping the open sores with jagged bits of pottery, as Job was (Job 2:8); they were in far worse shape. They did not know God.\nThe wicked live because God is giving them time to repent. Salvation is being held out with every passing minute. Real life is being offered. God gave you time to come to Him, for your faith to spring from the soil; He’s doing the same for others. And, He wants to use you to bring them into His kingdom. Until then, “Wait for the LORD and keep his way, and he will exalt you” in due time (Psalm 37:34).\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

The waves kept crashing, and though her little legs were fighting and her arms were still clinging to her board, she was running out of energy. Her mom, watching from a pile of rocks, screamed for help. Before the waves slammed the girl into a pillar, I was able to grab her. We then paddled over to her mother, who said, “Thank you. Thank you for saving her.”\nEven as waves were crashing into him, as he flailed in his faith, Job still knew: “I know that my Redeemer lives” (Job 19:25). He may not have understood why he was suffering. He may not have been privy to the conversations taking place in the unseen realm between his adversary and his God. It didn’t matter though. Job knew that his Redeemer was alive and well, and in that he had hope.\nDo you?\nIf it hasn’t already, suffering will come knocking on your door soon. It may have already arrived. Or it may have just left after a long season. Regardless, none of us is immune to pain. Know this, my brothers: God alone is our Redeemer. He is making all things new, redeeming them so that suffering will one day be unknown in this world (Isaiah 43:18–19; Revelation 21:5). In the meantime, He will bear you up, and He promises never to leave you or forsake you (Hebrews 13:5). Even when you walk through the darkest valley, He is right there with you. And He’s no stranger to suffering (Hebrews 4:15).\nJesus was nailed to the cross for you. He suffered the penalty of our sin, enduring the pain and the agony until His body was nothing more than a lifeless corpse—because He loves you. Never doubt His love and care. No matter how painful your trial, Jesus has experienced a pain far greater. Suffering has a way of clouding our thinking, of making us forget what is true. When that happens, remember the dark clouds that hovered over Golgotha, and remember the Suffering Servant. He now lives. He rose from the dead, ending the curse of sin, and He stands at the right hand of the Father, holding out the promise that one day, anyone who has placed their trust in Him will rise too.\nWritten by J.A.

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Do you remember the television show America’s Funniest Home Videos? It showcased real people attempting a lot of foolish things, all while their friends and family cheered them on, laughing at them and filming the events for posterity. It’s worth noting that if a friend tells you to stack one ladder on another so you can paint the second story of your house, first ask if they will pay your hospital bills. Counsel can be good, and it can be bad; it can revive or it can ruin. Job knows this firsthand.\nJob’s friends turned on him. They probably thought they were helping. After all, they had already grieved with him. Maybe they even thought, How long are we supposed to sit quietly with him? He needs to fess up already. So, Eliphaz grabs the mic and accuses Job of sin, reasoning that Job’s trials are his own fault. He even manages to crush the rest of his friends in the process, saying, “I have heard many things like these. You are all miserable comforters. Is there no end to your empty words?” (Job 16:2–3).\nIf we aren’t careful, we can be miserable comforters to our friends. We can’t speed up anyone’s season of suffering. When we become impatient, exasperated, or just fed up with the trials of another, we become what we hope would never come our way in our time of need. An accuser. A tempter. A liar.\nRash counsel and rushed advice can injure those who hear. If we don’t give careful consideration to our counsel, we will throw spiritual platitudes and canned Christianese at our friends as they walk through real pain, suffering, and heartache. It will make us feel better because we’re involved, but we will crush our friends as they hear our words. Yes, we are commanded to bear one another’s burdens, but not to fix them. The Lord tells us to pray and encourage one another, not blame one another.\nIf we, like Job’s friends, try to figure out our friends’ suffering, we run the risk of jumping to wrong conclusions because you and I are not God. We ought to point one another to the risen Christ, who also endured awful advice from His friends (Matthew 16:21–28). We should pray for our friends to find comfort in the Wonderful Counselor. Jesus knows what to do, and the Holy Spirit will give our friends the comfort they truly need.\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    One of the most difficult aspects of pastoral ministry is being well acquainted with the frailty of human life. I write this as our church family just buried Ed, a 94-year-old veteran of World War II. The man survived the enemy attack on the shore of a foreign battlefield and lived his entire life with shrapnel in his body from that incident. Ed’s life wasn’t always easy, but he was tough as nails. A true hero, Ed was one of the last members of the Greatest Generation. But despite being the hero he was, like all men, his death was a tender reminder that we are all fragile.\nStill, there is a certain refuge in death for the weary. As I sat at his funeral, I found comfort in the Christian doctrine of the future resurrection of the dead (Matthew 27:52). For Ed, and for all who are in Christ, death does not have the last word. Our fragility does not lead to our finality. In Job 14, we are reminded of what everyone in the ancient world believed: life continues after death.\nAnyone born of woman \nis short of days and full of trouble. \nHe blossoms like a flower, then withers; \nhe flees like a shadow and does not last. \nDo you really take notice of one like this? \nWill you bring me into judgment against you?\nWho can produce something pure from what is impure? \nNo one! (Job 14:1–4).\nIn light of the hope of eternity, human life difficult and brief. And because no human being is able to live outside the earthly limits God has set, we must set our hopes on life beyond the grave. From the depths of the earth, God will raise us again in Christ Jesus.\nIn John 5, Jesus reminds us that whoever hears His Word and believes that He is the life-giving Savior from God will pass from death to life (vv.24–25). There is a day coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. The same God who brought life into existence with His Word, will call forth new creation with His voice. The same Jesus who commanded dead Lazarus to come forth from his grave, will call all of His children forth to eternal life.\nI find great hope in the beautiful poem that the grieving theologian C. S. Lewis penned to be etched on the grave of his beloved wife Helen Joy Davidman: “Like cast off clothes was left behind in ashes, yet with hope that she, re-born from holy poverty, in lenten lands, hereafter may resume them on her Easter day.”\nWhen I think of Ed, I am reminded that his death is not a goodbye—it’s “See you soon.” This is the hope of what God’s promised in His Word. This is the gospel of Jesus Christ. When our flesh fails, God will be faithful to His Word. As Isaiah 40:8 reminds us, “The grass withers, the flowers fade, but the word of our God remains forever.”\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The English writer and philosopher Aldous Huxley once said, “There are things known and there are things unknown, and in between are the doors of perception.” I would argue that much of perception has to do with personal perspective. Consider a photograph, for example. A photographic image is only able to capture a moment in time, and only one perspective of that moment in time. Beyond the frame of the photograph, most of that moment is cropped out. In other words, your perception of that moment in time is limited by what is presented in the picture.\nIn many ways, this helps us understand the sharp challenge that Zophar aims at his friend, and Job’s response in Job chapters 11 and 12. From Zophar’s point of view, Job’s suffering is the result of his own secret wickedness. In one sense, we know that all suffering is a result of sin, and the brokenness we experience in this world is caused by sin. However, the irony of Zophar’s challenge, “Can you fathom the depths of God or discover the limits of the Almighty?” (Job 11:7), is that he presumes God’s purposes in Job’s suffering are obvious, transparent enough that he can rebuke Job and call him to repent.\nBut remember, Zophar has a limited perspective. Much of his indictment against Job is based on his own limited experience. Wisdom always has two sides: the known and the unknown. True wisdom understands that only God is able to view things from all vantage points. God’s wisdom is not always clear to us, especially in difficult times. During those times, it is important not to doubt God’s wisdom and providence over our lives.\nWe never have the whole picture, only our limited perspective. Based on the testimony of God’s character revealed in Scripture, we should fight to believe that God is ultimately sovereign over everything in life for these reasons: His glory and, ultimately, our good.\nTherefore, we should always aim to be attentive to what God may be doing in order to gain insight into His character and will. One of the most comforting truths to remember is that we have a good Shepherd, Jesus Christ, who is the overseer of our souls. Jesus is the true and greater Job, who innocently suffered, yet overcame and still intercedes for His friends. Not only did Jesus suffer for you, He did so by entrusting Himself to the Father. Unlike Zophar, who lodged critiques at Job, we have a Savior who knows suffering well, and is therefore able to empathize with us, offering true comfort and compassion.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Every single one of us has a deep sense of justice hardwired in our hearts. Indignation stirs in our spirit when we witness the guilty go free. The football stadium roars in anger when a referee calls an unwarranted penalty on the home team. The child passionately pleas their case when a parent punishes them for something they didn’t do. These reactions to injustice are a testimony to our inner conviction that God is just and has ordered the world to reflect His justice.\nIn Job 8, Bildad stands as an example of this truth. In light of the suffering that has come upon Job, his friend becomes aroused by anger and asks him how long will they have to hear his lament of suffering? Bildad roots his question in the character of God: “Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?” (Job 8:3). There must be a reason this suffering has fallen on Job, right? Perhaps Job’s children have sinned? If Job or his children were pure and upright, wouldn’t God bring restoration?\nIf we were to honestly read this passage with a humble view of ourselves, we would quickly see that no one—not even ourselves—could stand before the just God of the universe as pure and upright. And thus, our sense of justice condemns our own hearts. Our hearts confirm the witness of the apostle Paul in his letter to the Romans: “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). The testimony of Scripture is clear: the Lord will by no means clear the guilty.\nHow then do we respond? In despair, like Job? In anger, like Bildad? Thanks be to God, there is another way! God has not forsaken us in our sin. The suffering of Job points forward to Jesus, the truly innocent sufferer who consumed the just penalty for sin that we deserved (vv.24–26). No, God does not pervert justice! God’s Son paid for sin on the cross so that we may be forgiven. Because of this, God remains just even as He justifies those who have faith in Jesus Christ. This is the beauty of the gospel of grace. God is fair, and we deserve His justice because of the sin in our hearts. Jesus Christ takes what we deserve and gives us what we do not deserve: forgiveness.\nEven if Bildad’s sense of justice is correct, his impatient anger against Job is rooted in a religious understanding that is devoid of grace, and therefore, devoid of comfort for his friend. Even if we sympathize with Job’s despair, we understand that in the bigger picture, his suffering does not have the last word! In Christ, we experience the justice of God to which Bildad appealed, and we receive the comfort from suffering for which Job longed. In Christ, the guilty go free, because He takes the punishment we deserve. Let us run with urgency to our heavenly Father and thank Him for His mercy.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

It goes something like this:\nLinus: “Give me one good reason why I should memorize this.”\nLucy: “I’ll give you FIVE good reasons!” (She holds up five fingers, one by one, making a fist.) “One! Two!\nThree! Four! FIVE!!”\nLinus: “Those are good reasons! Christmas is not only getting too commercial, it’s getting too\ndangerous!”\nClassic. I mean sure, five is good. But like Linus, sometimes we just need one good reason to keep going. Just one. And sometimes, like Job, we look high and low and still struggle to find just one.\nWhat strength do I have, that I should continue to hope? \n What is my future, that I should be patient?… \n Since I cannot help myself,\n the hope for success has been banished from me (Job 6:11,13).\nIt’s easy to watch A Charlie Brown Christmas every year. There’s a sweetness to the truths that are communicated. They remind us of all that’s good and true (plus, it’s got an awesome soundtrack). It’s not so easy to read Job’s story. And why? Well, because the truths it presents have a brutal quality to them. There are no beautiful primary colors, no awesome soundtrack in the background. No, Job’s story is stark—a very grown-up tale—and as such, it challenges more than it comforts. Job comes face to face with something called hope, and he has to choose whether or not to use it.\nPaul gives the believers in Rome (and us) this working definition of hope: “Yet hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience” (Romans 8:24–25). Yep, probably not what most of us want to hear. We want just one good reason, something we can see, something tangible, But that’s not hope.\nHope is keeping on when you’re all out of reasons. Hope is patiently groaning along with all of creation for the redemption, not only of our bodies, but of all things (v.23). Hope is not a warm, fuzzy, childish cliché, but a dogged, determined, childlike faith in the God we cannot see, who gave us His one and only Son. If you stop and think about it, that’s all reason we’ll ever need.\nAnd that’s what hope is all about, Charlie Brown.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

Lewis, chances are good it’s due to his Chronicles of Narnia series with books like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. But Lewis was also an amazing philosopher and ethicist. One of his lesser known books is a collection of essays titled, God in the Dock.\nThe word “dock” refers to the place where the accused sits in a courtroom. Lewis contends that in ancient times, men approached God as an accused criminal would approach a judge. But for the modern man (which includes us), things are reversed. We sit in the judge’s seat, and God is on trial. God is in the dock, having to answer for everything from wars and weather patterns, to the rise and fall of the stock market, to the flow of traffic in our daily commute. Lewis writes: “The trial may even end in God’s acquittal. But the important thing is that man is on the bench and God is in the dock.”\nHow often do we put God on trial, in the dock? If we’re honest, probably more often than we’re comfortable admitting. After all, “Can a man be righteous before God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?” (Job 5:17).\nThe answer here is “No.” Full stop. As smart and savvy and progressive as we may consider ourselves to be, there is a Judge over all, over everything—and it most certainly is not us. Let me repeat that: We are not the judge.\n“So then, are we the accused?” you might ask. The answer here is a resounding “YES,” but with a clarification regarding God the Judge. He is righteous, and if we know Jesus, He judges us through the blood of His Son. As Paul tells us in Romans 5, “Since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (v.1).\nYou and I, in the dock, throwing ourselves upon God’s mercy, are forgiven, acquitted, set free. We no longer live as men who stand accused, but as sons who belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God. Full stop.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

It shocked the watching world, and it left Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan injured and unable to compete for some time. The enduring footage of the attack shows a crumpled Kerrigan in a dark hallway, crying and repeating one question over and over: “Why?”\nAlthough the attack, even years later, remains shadowed in some mystery, it appears to have been initially motivated by jealousy on the part of her rival, Tonya Harding. Nancy Kerrigan had done nothing wrong. The only thing she was guilty of was consistently outperforming her competitors.\nJob was not an Olympian, but his circumstances were not altogether different from Kerrigan’s. In a very real sense, he’d outperformed his fellow men in terms of integrity before God. He chased hard after the good and kept his distance from evil. But after an attack, seemingly out of nowhere, on his family, property, and even his own body, Job was left crumpled on the ground repeating a variation on that same word: Why? He lamented, “Why was I not stillborn; why did I not die as I came from the womb?” (Job 3:11).\nSearching for a reason for our suffering can be downright frustrating at best, and debilitatingly depressing at worst, because satisfactory answers are often hard to find. And the one place we think might hold keys to our questions—Scripture—asks us to suffer more by faith than by sight. In other words, we’re called to trust even when, and possibly most especially when, we don’t understand.\nI have no doubt the apostle Paul (another overachiever of sorts) had moments when he asked, “Why?”—times when he tried to squint through the glass darkly. But he confessed it was all worth it in order to know Christ “and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings” (Philippians 3:10).\nWhy? is a completely valid, human question.

As we prepared to leave, I reached into the pocket of my jeans and handed Laurin my car keys, then returned my hand to the same pocket to fish out the key to the truck. But it wasn’t there.\nPanicked, we searched the ground all around the truck. I retraced my steps through the house. I even called the fast-food restaurant where we had eaten lunch. But we couldn’t find it; the key seemed to have vanished. After a couple hours of looking, I begrudgingly called the rental company’s 24-hour toll-free number and admitted I’d lost the key. They told me they’d happily send out a locksmith and, even more happily, charge me a small fortune for the service.\nStanding there in the driveway beside our immobile truck, I thought about the loss of money and the loss of time we would endure because of the loss of this key, and I shifted into full blame mode. It was the rental company’s fault for handing me just a single key without a keychain, so easy to lose. It was Laurin’s fault for not bringing her own set of car keys, because with the weight of my own keys in my pocket, I never noticed the missing truck key. And it was my own fault for not being more careful.\nWhen something bad happens, we want to get to the bottom of it. Why did this happen? Who caused this? How do we avoid this next time? Our missing key was trivial. We were on the road in a few hours, and the rental company never even charged me for the locksmith. But when we have a true loss in life—our health, a loved one, a marriage—the blame game takes on deeper meaning.\nIn these early chapters of Job, we get a glimpse into the heavenly realm. We get to witness what Job and his friends did not: that every single calamity in Job’s life was seen and permitted by God. The same is true in our lives. Of course, we must remember that God is never the author of evil (Psalm 5:4), we live in a broken, fallen world (Romans 5:12), and choices have consequences (Proverbs 14:12). But God is sovereign (Job 42:2; Proverbs 16:4). Nothing enters our lives that has not first passed through His hands. As Job himself asked rhetorically, “Should we accept only good from God and not adversity?” (Job 2:10).\nThe book of Job can be difficult to read, because it doesn’t provide easy answers to the problem of human suffering. In fact, these opening chapters add a new difficulty to work through: God’s role in allowing suffering into our lives.\nWhile God’s sovereign rule over heaven and earth may leave us asking, “Why, Lord?” alongside Job, it is God’s sovereignty that should be our greatest comfort. He has decreed a day when all evil, pain, and suffering will cease (Revelation 21:4). And in moments of despair, He promises to be near to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18). Suffering is bigger than any easy answer we can muster. Thankfully, we can bring our suffering to God, who is bigger still. He who did not spare His own Son the suffering of the cross will not leave us nor forsake us (Hebrews 13:5; Deuteronomy 31:6).\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

Work and Wealth: Wisdom concerning our material world\nThis week’s proverbs will turn our attention to biblical wisdom concerning how we interact with the material world. We’ll explore the topics of diligence and laziness, justice, generosity and gluttony, wealth and poverty, and good versus evil.\nDay Twenty-Six: Good and Evil, Faithfulness and Truthfulness \nJesus says, “I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. For He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous” (Matthew 5:44-45). Amos 5:15 says, “Hate evil and love good.” These two passages do not contradict each other. They clarify each other.\nOne of the profound characteristics of a maturing Christ follower is a desire to live in the tension of hating evil while loving our enemies. In a way, this is the heart of the gospel—Christ came carrying an unwavering disdain for the sin at work in us while maintaining an unwavering love for us.\nConsider how these proverbs show us how to live in that tension.\nGood and Evil\nProverbs 1:10-19\nMy son, if sinners entice you,\ndon’t be persuaded.\n11 If they say—“Come with us!\nLet’s set an ambush and kill someone.\nLet’s attack some innocent person just for fun!\n12 Let’s swallow them alive, like Sheol,\nstill healthy as they go down to the Pit.\n13 We’ll find all kinds of valuable property\nand fill our houses with plunder.\n14 Throw in your lot with us,\nand we’ll all share our money”—\n15 my son, don’t travel that road with them\nor set foot on their path,\n16 because their feet run toward trouble\nand they hurry to commit murder.\n17 It is foolish to spread a net\nwhere any bird can see it,\n18 but they set an ambush to kill themselves;\nthey attack their own lives.\n19 Such are the paths of all who make profit dishonestly;\nit takes the lives of those who receive it.\nProverbs 11:3-5\nThe integrity of the upright guides them,\nbut the perversity of the treacherous destroys them.\n4 Wealth is not profitable on a day of wrath,\nbut righteousness rescues from death.\n5 The righteousness of the blameless clears his path,\nbut the wicked person will fall because of his wickedness.\nProverbs 14:14\nThe disloyal one will get what his conduct deserves,\nand a good man, what his deeds deserve.\nProverbs 25:21-22\nIf your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat,\nand if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;\n22 for you will heap burning coals on his head,\nand the Lord will reward you.\nAsk\nQ. How often would you say you are caught in an internal struggle between good and evil? \nQ. See Proverbs 1:10-19. What does traveling the road of sinners look like for you? \nQ. What is Proverbs 25:21-22 saying? What do you think “you will heap burning coals on his head” means? \nFaithfulness and Truthfulness\nProverbs 3:3-4\nNever let loyalty and faithfulness leave you.\nTie them around your neck;\nwrite them on the tablet of your heart.\n4 Then you will find favor and high regard\nin the sight of God and man.\nProverbs 30:5\nEvery word of God is pure;\nHe is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.\nProverbs 20:6\nMany a man proclaims his own loyalty,\nbut who can find a trustworthy man?\nProverbs 20:17\nFood gained by fraud is sweet to a man,\nbut afterward his mouth is full of gravel.\nProverbs 13:5\nThe righteous hate lying,\nbut the wicked act disgustingly and disgracefully.\nProverbs 11:13\nA gossip goes around revealing a secret,\nbut a trustworthy person keeps a confidence.\nProverbs 25:13\nTo those who send him, a trustworthy messenger\nis like the coolness of snow on a harvest day;\nhe refreshes the life of his masters.\nProverbs 25:19\nTrusting an unreliable person in a difficult time\nis like a rotten tooth or a faltering foot.\nProverbs 27:6\nThe wounds of a friend are trustworthy,\nbut the kisses of an enemy are excessive.\nAsk\nQ. See Proverbs 3:3. How do you tie truth around your neck and write it on the tablet of your heart? \nQ. Who are some faithful people in your life? If an unfaithful person is compared to a bad tooth or a busted foot (Proverbs 25:19), to what would you compare a faithful person? Get creative. \nQ. Look at Proverbs 13:5. Do you hate lying? What must be true in a person’s heart in order for them to hate lying? \nQ. How has Christ epitomized the faithfulness depicted in these proverbs? \n\n                ",

Work and Wealth: Wisdom concerning our material world\nThis week’s proverbs will turn our attention to biblical wisdom concerning how we interact with the material world. We’ll explore the topics of diligence and laziness, justice, generosity and gluttony, wealth and poverty, and good versus evil.\nDay Twenty-Five: Debt, Wealth, and Poverty \nMoney is more than a means to buy the things we need. It is power, and it always has been. This is why the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil (1 Timothy 6:10): it is the love of being able to wield power for our own benefit.\nThere is nothing inherently sinful about being wealthy. The Lord gave King Solomon great wealth. And He continues to do this, using the generosity of His people to fund important works of mercy and justice around the world. But God’s people are called to be very careful when it comes to the pursuit and use of wealth, and very generous when it comes to caring for the poor.\nConsider the principles of debt, wealth, and poverty raised in these proverbs.\nDebt\nProverbs 6:1-5\n6 My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor\nor entered into an agreement with a stranger,\n2 you have been trapped by the words of your lips—\nensnared by the words of your mouth.\n3 Do this, then, my son, and free yourself,\nfor you have put yourself in your neighbor’s power:\nGo, humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor.\n4 Don’t give sleep to your eyes\nor slumber to your eyelids.\n5 Escape like a gazelle from a hunter,\nlike a bird from a fowler’s trap.\nProverbs 11:15\nIf someone puts up security for a stranger,\nhe will suffer for it,\nbut the one who hates such agreements is protected.\nProverbs 22:26-27\nDon’t be one of those who enter agreements,\nwho put up security for loans.\n27 If you have no money to pay,\neven your bed will be taken from under you.\nAsk\nQ. Have you ever financially over-extended yourself? If so, what did that experience teach you? \nQ. Isn’t it interesting that the Bible speaks about co-signing for someone else’s loan, or “putting up security for a stranger”? How would you summarize the wise counsel given in these proverbs concerning co-signing? \nQ. What is the wise counsel from these verses concerning debt? What does teaching about debt have to do with living in the freedom of the gospel?\nWealth and Poverty\nProverbs 6:10-11\n10 A little sleep, a little slumber,\na little folding of the arms to rest,\n11 and your poverty will come like a robber,\nyour need, like a bandit.\nProverbs 13:7\nOne man pretends to be rich but has nothing;\nanother pretends to be poor but has great wealth.\nProverbs 18:23\nThe poor man pleads,\nbut the rich one answers roughly.\nProverbs 20:21\nAn inheritance gained prematurely\nwill not be blessed ultimately.\nProverbs 22:1-2, 4\n1 A good name is to be chosen over great wealth;\nfavor is better than silver and gold.\n2 The rich and the poor have this in common:\nthe Lord made them both.\n4 The result of humility is fear of the Lord,\nalong with wealth, honor, and life.\nAsk\nQ. Read Proverbs 13:7. If you were given a million dollars, would you be more likely to blow it on excess or bury it in the ground? What does your answer reveal about your view of wealth? Your view of God? \nQ. Look at Proverbs 20:21. What do you think is behind our fascination with gaining instant wealth? \nQ. Being as honest with yourself as you can be, do you think you are a person who easily sees the poverty in and around you? Why is poverty so difficult to see?\n\n                ",

Work and Wealth: Wisdom concerning our material world\nThis week’s proverbs will turn our attention to biblical wisdom concerning how we interact with the material world. We’ll explore the topics of diligence and laziness, justice, generosity and gluttony, wealth and poverty, and good versus evil.\nDay Twenty-Four: Generosity and Gluttony\nGluttony and generosity are opposites. One involves taking as much in as we possibly can for our own enjoyment; the other focuses on giving of ourselves to others to help meet their needs. One makes us sick; one makes others well.\nThe true problem with gluttony has less to do with how many calories we take in or how big our waists become. It has to do with our ability to practice the fruit of the Spirit, self-control—an essential component of generosity. Generosity is always an exercise in self-control because it requires us to give when our instinct is to keep.\nConsider how these proverbs link gluttony and generosity together, and let their wisdom hold up a mirror for you.\nGenerosity\nProverbs 3:27-28\n27 When it is in your power,\ndon’t withhold good from the one it belongs to.\n28 Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go away! Come back later.\nI’ll give it tomorrow”—when it is there with you.\nProverbs 19:17\nKindness to the poor is a loan to the Lord,\nand He will give a reward to the lender.\nProverbs 30:15-16\nThe leech has two daughters: “Give, Give!”\nThree things are never satisfied;\nfour never say, “Enough!”:\n16 Sheol; a childless womb;\nearth, which is never satisfied with water;\nand fire, which never says, “Enough!”\nAsk\nQ. Why does God care about how we handle our possessions? \nQ. Look at Proverbs 30:15-16. Have you ever been bitten by a leech? What about this creature’s process makes it a fitting symbol of greed? \nQ. Think of a time you withheld giving to someone, knowing you should have been generous. Why did you withhold your generosity? \nGluttony\nProverbs 21:17\nThe one who loves pleasure will become a poor man;\nwhoever loves wine and oil will not get rich.\nProverbs 23:19-21\n19 Listen, my son, and be wise;\nkeep your mind on the right course.\n20 Don’t associate with those who drink too much wine\nor with those who gorge themselves on meat.\n21 For the drunkard and the glutton will become poor,\nand grogginess will clothe them in rags.\nProverbs 25:16\nIf you find honey, eat only what you need;\notherwise, you’ll get sick from it and vomit.\nProverbs 28:7\nA discerning son keeps the law,\nbut a companion of gluttons humiliates his father.\nAsk\nQ. Where are you a glutton—what appetites have a hold on your heart? Why do you think God cares about gluttony? How does gluttony contradict godliness? \nQ. What sort of “poverty” do you think is being described in Proverbs 23:19-21? \nQ. Proverbs 28:7 tells us there is a relational cost to our own personal gluttony. What does gluttony cost us relationally, and why do you think gluttony works this way? \n\n                ",

We’ll explore the topics of diligence and laziness, justice, generosity and gluttony, wealth and poverty, and good versus evil.\nDay Twenty-Three: Security and Justice \nYou have only ever had one provider. One of the most frequent commands in the Bible is, “Do not fear.” This command is less about feeling the sensation of fear and more about what our fear tells us about our view of God. We’re called to live without fear because God, who made us, knows our needs and takes care of us.\nOf course, as we’ve already seen in this study, sometimes God’s provision comes in the form of loss, by way of inheriting the natural consequences of our actions. But God calls us to honor Him by trusting in His goodness, rather than our possessions, to give us security.\nThese proverbs help us understand security and justice from a biblical perspective.\nSecurity\nProverbs 1:33\nBut whoever listens to me will live securely\nand be free from the fear of danger.\nProverbs 13:6\nRighteousness guards people of integrity,\nbut wickedness undermines the sinner.\nProverbs 3:9-10 ESV\nHonor the Lord with your wealth\nand with the firstfruits of all your produce;\nthen your barns will be filled with plenty,\nand your vats will be bursting with wine.\nProverbs 4:13\nHold on to instruction; don’t let go.\nGuard it, for it is your life.\nAsk\nQ. Look at Proverbs 1:33. What benefit is there in listening to God? What is your security? \nQ. Why does Scripture talk about giving in terms of “firstfruits” (Proverbs 3:9)? What is the wisdom of giving from the top of our resources as opposed to the bottom? In what ways does giving “firstfruits” combat the power of greed in our hearts? \nQ. Look at Proverbs 4:13. What does it look like to “hold on to instruction”? \nJustice\nProverbs 11:1\nDishonest scales are detestable to the Lord,\nbut an accurate weight is His delight.\nProverbs 13:23\nThe uncultivated field of the poor yields abundant food,\nbut without justice, it is swept away.\nProverbs 18:13\nThe one who gives an answer before he listens—\nthis is foolishness and disgrace for him.\nProverbs. 18:17\nThe first to state his case seems right\nuntil another comes and cross-examines him.\nProverbs 22:28\nDon’t move an ancient boundary marker\nthat your fathers set up.\nAsk\nQ. Name a time when you have fallen prey to the sort of folly described in Proverbs 18:13. How does answering without listening contribute to injustice? Why do you think people are so quick to speak confidently about things we don’t fully understand? \nQ. What does Proverbs 22:28 have to do with preserving justice? What do you think is the wisdom behind this specific instruction not to move an ancient landmark? \nQ. These proverbs tie the plight of the poor to whoever reads these words of God’s wisdom. What does the plight of the poor have to do with you? Why should you care? Why is it wise and godly to care? \n\n                ",

Work and Wealth: Wisdom concerning our material world\nThis week’s proverbs will turn our attention to biblical wisdom concerning how we interact with the material world. We’ll explore the topics of diligence and laziness, justice, generosity and gluttony, wealth and poverty, and good versus evil.\nDay Twenty-Two: Diligence and Laziness\nWhen Jesus taught us to pray, He told us to say, “Give us today our daily bread” (Matthew 6:11). Not our monthly or yearly bread, but our daily bread. The instruction to pray for daily sustenance implies that we are meant to always be engaged in the work and provision of life. We are not meant to be workaholics, but neither are we meant to coast. We are called to engage with the life we’ve been given.\nGodly diligence is the pursuit of contributing beauty, goodness, and truth in whatever ways we can. Consider how these proverbs help us understand that call.\nDiligence\nProverbs 4:23\nGuard your heart above all else,\nfor it is the source of life.\nProverbs 12:27\nA lazy man doesn’t roast his game,\nbut to a diligent man, his wealth is precious.\nProverbs 13:11\nWealth obtained by fraud will dwindle,\nbut whoever earns it through labor will multiply it.\nProverbs 22:29\nDo you see a man skilled in his work?\nHe will stand in the presence of kings.\nHe will not stand in the presence of unknown men.\nProverbs 27:23-27\n23 Know well the condition of your flock,\nand pay attention to your herds,\n24 for wealth is not forever;\nnot even a crown lasts for all time.\n25 When hay is removed and new growth appears\nand the grain from the hills is gathered in,\n26 lambs will provide your clothing,\nand goats, the price of a field;\n27 there will be enough goat’s milk for your food—\nfood for your household\nand nourishment for your female servants.\nAsk\nQ. In what areas of your life are you the most diligent? What does Scripture call us to be diligent about?\nQ. Proverbs 4:23 calls us to “guard our hearts.” What does it mean to make caring for your heart a priority? \nQ. What are the ways you currently take care of your heart? If you don’t have an answer, what would it look like for you to begin? \nLaziness\nProverbs 6:6-11\n6 Go to the ant, you slacker!\nObserve its ways and become wise.\n7 Without leader, administrator, or ruler,\n8 it prepares its provisions in summer;\nit gathers its food during harvest.\n9 How long will you stay in bed, you slacker?\nWhen will you get up from your sleep?\n10 A little sleep, a little slumber,\na little folding of the arms to rest,\n11 and your poverty will come like a robber,\nyour need, like a bandit.\nProverbs 26:14-16\n14 A door turns on its hinges,\nand a slacker, on his bed.\n15 The slacker buries his hand in the bowl;\nhe is too weary to bring it to his mouth.\n16 In his own eyes, a slacker is wiser\nthan seven men who can answer sensibly.\nProverbs 15:19\nA slacker’s way is like a thorny hedge,\nbut the path of the upright is a highway.\nAsk\nQ. We live in a culture of busy people. Is it possible to be extremely busy and extremely lazy at the same time? Explain. \nQ. What does laziness look like in your life? Why is laziness a gospel issue? Why, specifically, is it sinful? \nQ. Under the banner of a gracious God, how would you state in the positive the negative command, “Don’t be lazy”? \n\n                ",

We praise our Lord and Father with it, and we curse men who are made in God’s likeness with it. Praising and cursing come out of the same mouth. My brothers, these things should not be this way” (James 3:7-10).\nFew of us probably spend much time considering how we use our words throughout the course of a day. Use this day to pay careful attention to your words, and see what wisdom these proverbs have for you.\nProverbs 29:20\nDo you see a man who speaks too soon?\nThere is more hope for a fool than for him.\nProverbs 10:11\nThe mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life,\nbut the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.\nProverbs 15:1-2\nA gentle answer turns away anger,\nbut a harsh word stirs up wrath.\n2 The tongue of the wise makes knowledge attractive,\nbut the mouth of fools blurts out foolishness.\nProverbs 26:4-5\nDon’t answer a fool according to his foolishness\nor you’ll be like him yourself.\n5 Answer a fool according to his foolishness\nor he’ll become wise in his own eyes.\nProverbs 31:8-9\nSpeak up for those who have no voice,\nfor the justice of all who are dispossessed.\n9 Speak up, judge righteously,\nand defend the cause of the oppressed and needy.\nAsk\nQ. Why do our words matter so much? What is it about the way God made us that gives power to words? \nQ. Our words can give life and take life. They can bring light or add darkness. How have you given light and life with your words? How have you spoken death and darkness?\nQ. Why do you think Proverbs 26:4 and 26:5 are back to back? Is this a contradiction in the Bible, or is there an important principle of wisdom to be found in their being placed beside each other? If so, what is it? \nQ. Are there any areas of your life where you know you need to practice the wisdom of Proverbs 31:8-9? \n\n                ",

Relationships: Wisdom concerning our interpersonal lives\nThis week’s proverbs are turning our attention outward to the relationships we have with others. We’re looking at the the wisdom God’s Word gives us concerning parents and children, adultery, correction, and the power of the tongue.\nDay Eighteen: Correction\nAs followers of Jesus, we are called to humility—to be open to correction from God’s Word, and from people in our lives who love us.\nReceiving correction, as with seeking counsel, requires the humility to openly admit that we do not know all there is to know. It also requires the grace to receive what may, at the time, feel like a wound, believing that wounds from a true friend can be trusted.\nConsider how these proverbs dealing with correction work to correct you even as you read them.\nProverbs 3:12\n[F]or the Lord disciplines the one He loves,\njust as a father, the son he delights in.\nProverbs 6:23\nFor a command is a lamp, teaching is a light,\nand corrective discipline is the way to life.\nProverbs 9:8\nDon’t rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you;\nrebuke a wise man, and he will love you.\nProverbs 11:14\nWithout guidance, people fall,\nbut with many counselors there is deliverance.\nProverbs 12:1\nWhoever loves discipline loves knowledge,\nbut one who hates correction is stupid.\nProverbs 19:20-21\nListen to counsel and receive instruction\nso that you may be wise later in life.\n21 Many plans are in a man’s heart,\nbut the Lord’s decree will prevail.\nProverbs 27:5-6\nBetter an open reprimand\nthan concealed love.\n6 The wounds of a friend are trustworthy,\nbut the kisses of an enemy are excessive.\nAsk\nQ. From whom do you welcome correction? Why? Who seeks wise counsel from you? Why? \nQ. Consider Proverbs 9:8. Describe what a mocker is and does. What motivates them to do so? Are you a mocker? \nQ. How would you explain the meaning of Proverbs 27:6 to a friend? What are some wounds good friends have given you in the spirit of this proverb? What do you think the phrase “kisses of an enemy” means?\n\n                ",

Relationships: Wisdom concerning our interpersonal lives\nThis week’s proverbs are turning our attention outward to the relationships we have with others. We’re looking at the the wisdom God’s Word gives us concerning parents and children, adultery, correction, and the power of the tongue.\nDay Seventeen: Adultery\nNotice the way this topic, adultery, comes up in Scripture. It is included in the Ten Commandments as a clear statement of Law: “Don’t do this.” But the Book of Proverbs adds a layer of complexity to that law by discussing the sometimes hard-to-detect process often involved in committing this particular sin.\nFew people wake up in the morning saying, “Today I am going to commit adultery.” Much of the time, the act of adultery is the product of walking a long and dangerous road of seduction. Sometimes the seductress described in this text is a particular person (man or woman) who tries to lure another person into infidelity. But sometimes the seductress in this passage can be the unchecked longings and unaddressed pains in our own hearts, calling to us from within to succumb to temptation with the promise that it will bring us happiness.\nKeep both of these meanings in mind when reading these proverbs about adultery.\nProverbs 5:1-17\n5 My son, pay attention to my wisdom;\nlisten closely to my understanding\n2 so that you may maintain discretion\nand your lips safeguard knowledge.\n3 Though the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey\nand her words are smoother than oil,\n4 in the end she’s as bitter as wormwood\nand as sharp as a double-edged sword.\n5 Her feet go down to death;\nher steps head straight for Sheol.\n6 She doesn’t consider the path of life;\nshe doesn’t know that her ways are unstable.\n7 So now, my sons, listen to me,\nand don’t turn away from the words of my mouth.\n8 Keep your way far from her.\nDon’t go near the door of her house.\n9 Otherwise, you will give up your vitality to others\nand your years to someone cruel;\n10 strangers will drain your resources,\nand your earnings will end up in a foreigner’s house.\n11 At the end of your life, you will lament\nwhen your physical body has been consumed,\n12 and you will say, “How I hated discipline,\nand how my heart despised correction.\n13 I didn’t obey my teachers\nor listen closely to my mentors.\n14 I am on the verge of complete ruin\nbefore the entire community.”\n15 Drink water from your own cistern,\nwater flowing from your own well.\n16 Should your springs flow in the streets,\nstreams of water in the public squares?\n17 They should be for you alone\nand not for you to share with strangers.\nAsk\nQ. Why do you suppose this passage is so personalized and told like a vivid story, as opposed to being a list of reasons why adultery is wrong? \nQ. Describe the temptress wooing your heart in this season of your life. \nQ. It is interesting that a negative thing (an immoral woman) is compared to a sharp two-edged sword, when the Word of God is also compared to a sharp two-edged sword (Hebrews 4:12). What do they have in common? \nQ. What does “Keep your way far from her” mean in Proverbs 5:8? Practically, what are some ways you can do this as it relates to the particular temptation you are facing? \n \n\n                ",

Relationships: Wisdom concerning our interpersonal lives\nThis week’s proverbs are turning our attention outward to the relationships we have with others. We’re looking at the the wisdom God’s Word gives us concerning parents and children, adultery, correction, and the power of the tongue.\nDay Sixteen: Parents and Children \nThe last words in the Old Testament, in Malachi chapter 4, tell us that the Messiah will “turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers,” healing what is broken between them (v. 6). Few relationships carry greater room for pain or influence than the parent-child relationship.\nThe Book of Proverbs does not assume this relationship is easy, or that its health is automatic. But it does acknowledge that this relationship, potentially more than any other, has the capacity to shape a young person’s life in beautiful and lasting ways.\nThe wisdom given here looks very much like what Jesus described as the greatest love there is—one person laying down their life for another (John 15:13). These proverbs shed some light on what that sort of self-sacrifice looks like.\nProverbs 10:1\nA wise son brings joy to his father,\nbut a foolish son, heartache to his mother.\nProverbs 13:1\nA wise son responds to his father’s discipline,\nbut a mocker doesn’t listen to rebuke.\nProverbs 14:26\nIn the fear of the Lord one has strong confidence\nand his children have a refuge.\nProverbs 19:18\nDiscipline your son while there is hope;\ndon’t be intent on killing him.\nProverbs 22:6\nTeach a youth about the way he should go;\neven when he is old he will not depart from it.\nProverbs 22:15\nFoolishness is tangled up in the heart of a youth;\nthe rod of discipline will drive it away from him.\nProverbs 30:17\nAs for the eye that ridicules a father\nand despises obedience to a mother,\nmay ravens of the valley pluck it out\nand young vultures eat it.\nAsk\nQ. Looking back, how did you see the wisdom in these verses modeled for you (or not modeled for you) when you were younger? What can you learn from that now? \nQ. Look at Proverbs 10:1. Why do the actions of a child have so much impact on the hearts of his or her parents? \nQ. Why does the Bible tell parents to train their children early? \nQ. In what ways does the parent-child relationship uniquely cultivate understanding of the gospel in our lives? \n\n                ",

Relationships: Wisdom concerning our interpersonal lives\nThis week’s proverbs will turn our attention outward to the relationships we have with others. Let’s look at the the wisdom God’s Word gives us concerning parents and children, adultery, correction, and the power of the tongue.\nDay Fifteen: A Virtuous Woman\nProverbs 31 is the most comprehensive description of a godly woman in Scripture. It is also a poem—an acrostic—each line beginning with the next letter in the Hebrew alphabet. The poetic structure adds to the mystery, orderliness, and poetry of the woman being described.\nThough not all of the qualities here belong solely to women (Proverbs 31:16, for example), this chapter gives us an ideal personification of virtue—a person “who fears the Lord” (Proverbs 31:30). What are those virtues? Read the passage to see.\nProverbs 31:10-31\n10 Who can find a capable wife?\nShe is far more precious than jewels.\n11 The heart of her husband trusts in her,\nand he will not lack anything good.\n12 She rewards him with good, not evil,\nall the days of her life.\n13 She selects wool and flax\nand works with willing hands.\n14 She is like the merchant ships,\nbringing her food from far away.\n15 She rises while it is still night\nand provides food for her household\nand portions for her female servants.\n16 She evaluates a field and buys it;\nshe plants a vineyard with her earnings.\n17 She draws on her strength\nand reveals that her arms are strong.\n18 She sees that her profits are good,\nand her lamp never goes out at night.\n19 She extends her hands to the spinning staff,\nand her hands hold the spindle.\n20 Her hands reach out to the poor,\nand she extends her hands to the needy.\n21 She is not afraid for her household when it snows,\nfor all in her household are doubly clothed.\n22 She makes her own bed coverings;\nher clothing is fine linen and purple.\n23 Her husband is known at the city gates,\nwhere he sits among the elders of the land.\n24 She makes and sells linen garments;\nshe delivers belts to the merchants.\n25 Strength and honor are her clothing,\nand she can laugh at the time to come.\n26 She opens her mouth with wisdom\nand loving instruction is on her tongue.\n27 She watches over the activities of her household\nand is never idle.\n28 Her sons rise up and call her blessed.\nHer husband also praises her:\n29 “Many women are capable,\nbut you surpass them all!”\n30 Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting,\nbut a woman who fears the Lord will be praised.\n31 Give her the reward of her labor,\nand let her works praise her at the city gates.\nQ. This picture of the virtuous woman comes to us from an ancient context. What are some present day comparisons you could make between the woman in this passage and a godly woman today? \nQ. How is the woman depicted in this passage different from the women our culture tends to prize? \nQ. What does this picture of a virtuous woman reveal about what it means to be a virtuous man? What would a man whose character perfectly complements this woman be like? \nQ. If you have a woman like this in your life, how can you tell her before the sun goes down today? \n\n                ",

You’ll find a short introduction to the Proverbs reading plan on Day 1.\nSection Two—The Inner Life:Wisdom concerning the body, heart, and mind\nThe proverbs we study this week we are turning our attention inward. We’re examining ourselves in light of the wisdom God’s Word provides on the topics of seduction and strength, health and happiness, adversity and anger, counsel and instruction, and humility and pride.\nDay Twelve: Humility and Pride\nIn Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis wrote, “the essential vice, the utmost evil, is Pride. Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere flea bites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.”\nThe wise person assumes the battle between humility and pride is always raging in our hearts. These proverbs help us understand that fight.\nProverbs 11:2\nWhen pride comes, disgrace follows,\nbut with humility comes wisdom.\nProverbs 15:33\nThe fear of the Lord is what wisdom teaches,\nand humility comes before honor.\nProverbs 22:4\nThe result of humility is fear of the Lord,\nalong with wealth, honor, and life.\nProverbs 27:1-2\nDon’t boast about tomorrow,\nfor you don’t know what a day might bring.\n2 Let another praise you, and not your own mouth—\na stranger, and not your own lips.\nProverbs 29:23\nA person’s pride will humble him,\nbut a humble spirit will gain honor.\nAsk\nQ. Where does pride have its strongest hold on you? \nQ. What is the difference between self-deprecation and humility? Why do you think we employ false humility in the ways we relate to others? What do we want it to do for us? \nQ. In these proverbs, humility is associated with wisdom, honor, and riches. Pride, however, is associated with shame. Do you functionally live as someone who accepts these connections or as one who rejects the idea that they are related? \nQ. We should be people who seek to praise God for the work He is doing in us. The gospel tells us that the Holy Spirit works in the lives of believers to make us more like Jesus (Philippians 2:13). This means He is working to cultivate humility in us. Name a place in your life where you can thank God for bringing you true humility? \n\n                ",

We’re examining ourselves in light of the wisdom God’s Word provides on the topics of seduction and strength, health and happiness, adversity and anger, counsel and instruction, and humility and pride.\nDay Eleven: Counsel and Instruction\nSeek counsel. Desire to be taught. Nurture a curiosity to explore things you don’t understand.\nOn a purely intellectual level, these ideas make perfect sense—to the extent that they shouldn’t even need to be said. But because we are proud, our hearts tense up at the suggestion that we have much to learn.\nThe way of wisdom is about more than simply obtaining new information. It is about living as part of a community where we gladly regard one another as valuable.\nThese proverbs charge us to lay down our pride and seek counsel and instruction.\nCounsel and Instruction\nProverbs 3:6\nThink about Him in all your ways,\nand He will guide you on the right paths.\nProverbs 12:15-16\nA fool’s way is right in his own eyes,\nbut whoever listens to counsel is wise.\nA fool’s displeasure is known at once,\nbut whoever ignores an insult is sensible.\nProverbs 13:20\nThe one who walks with the wise will become wise,\nbut a companion of fools will suffer harm.\nProverbs 17:10\nA rebuke cuts into a perceptive person\nmore than a hundred lashes into a fool.\nProverbs 19:20\nListen to counsel and receive instruction\nso that you may be wise later in life.\nAsk\nQ. Are you someone who desires wise counsel, or are you someone who wants to find your own way?\nQ. How do you react when people try to tell you what you should do? How do you react to a command from God that you’re not particularly fond of?\nQ. What does it look like to walk with wise people? How is this something you are doing, or could do, in your life?\nQ. Think about those people who have counseled and instructed you. Are you becoming someone who has counsel and instruction to give? Is there anyone in your life right now who needs your wisdom, experience, and counsel? What would it look like for you to pursue that person this week?\n\n                ",

We’re examining ourselves in light of the wisdom God’s Word provides on the topics of seduction and strength, health and happiness, adversity and anger, counsel and instruction, and humility and pride.\nDay Ten: Adversity and Anger \nHarboring anger can destroy a person, but facing our anger often requires a great deal of humility and courage. It is easier to blame other people for the problems in our lives than to do the soul-searching work of admitting our own responsibility. The Bible cares about how we handle relationships in times of adversity and through seasons of anger.\nThese proverbs are like a hand on your shoulder, telling you to take a breath before you barge, guns blazing, into conflict.\nAdversity\nProverbs 3:25-26\n25 Don’t fear sudden danger\nor the ruin of the wicked when it comes,\n26 for the Lord will be your confidence\nand will keep your foot from a snare.\nProverbs 17:17\nA friend loves at all times,and a brother is born for a difficult time.\nProverbs 27:10\nDon’t abandon your friend or your father’s friend,\nand don’t go to your brother’s house\nin your time of calamity;\nbetter a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.\nAsk\nQ. Look at Proverbs 3:25-26. What dangers do you fear the most? What does it mean that the Lord is our “confidence”? \nQ. What is your general reaction to adversity? Do you tend to blame God for it? Do you reach out to Him for comfort? \nQ.

What makes you angry? Why? In what ways do you see pride and anger working together in your life?\nQ. Based on the wisdom of these verses, do you think it is possible for you to harbor anger without it affecting anyone else? Why or why not?\nQ. Do you harbor anger? Does unresolved anger ever just go away? What hope does Scripture give us for our angry hearts (see Proverbs 10:12)? \n\n                ",

We’re examining ourselves in light of the wisdom God’s Word provides on the topics of seduction and strength, health and happiness, adversity and anger, counsel and instruction, and humility and pride.\nDay Nine: Health and Happiness \nThe first question of the Westminster Shorter Catechism asks, “What is the chief end of man?” and answers, “To glorify God and enjoy Him forever.” This answer assumes two profound truths: we are made to be happy, and we are eternal beings. The Bible has a lot to say about both of these. Our hearts and our health matter to God.\nThough we are eternal beings, God created us with bodies. He also tells us that we will have glorified bodies for all eternity, where there will be no more sadness or pain—only joy. Right now, however, we live in a fallen world where our joy is sometimes quelled and our bodies sometimes break.\nThese proverbs help us live now in light of the eternal comfort that awaits.\nHealth\nProverbs 4:20-22\n20 My son, pay attention to my words;\nlisten closely to my sayings.\n21 Don’t lose sight of them;\nkeep them within your heart.\n22 For they are life to those who find them,\nand health to one’s whole body.\nProverbs 14:30\nA tranquil heart is life to the body,\nbut jealousy is rottenness to the bones.\nProverbs 18:14\nA man’s spirit can endure sickness,\nbut who can survive a broken spirit?\nProverbs 25:25\nGood news from a distant land\nis like cold water to a parched throat.\nAsk\nQ. These proverbs hold physical well-being up as a good thing and as a benefit of spiritual health. How are the two connected? What are the spiritual reasons we should care about our physical health? \nQ. How would you explain the connection between wise counsel and “health to one’s whole body” (Proverbs 4:22)?

Where do you turn when your spiritual health needs a lift?\nHappiness\nProverbs 3:13-14\n13 Happy is a man who finds wisdom\nand who acquires understanding,\n14 for she is more profitable than silver,\nand her revenue is better than gold.\nProverbs 14:10, 13\n10 The heart knows its own bitterness,\nand no outsider shares in its joy.\n13 Even in laughter a heart may be sad,\nand joy may end in grief.\nProverbs 24:17\nDon’t gloat when your enemy falls,\nand don’t let your heart rejoice when he stumbles…\nProverbs 29:18\nWithout revelation people run wild,\nbut one who listens to instruction will be happy.\nAsk\nQ. We all want to be happy in this life, but Colossians 3:2 tells us to set our minds on things above, not on earthly things. How do you see yourself placing value and identity in your own personal happiness, and how do you measure it?\nQ. Put into your own words a definition of godly happiness. What light does Proverbs 14:10&13 shed on true happiness? \nQ. Look at Proverbs 29:18. What is the relationship between happiness and obedience to God? \n\n                ",

You’ll find a short introduction to the Proverbs reading plan on Day 1.\nSection Two—The Inner Life:Wisdom concerning the body, heart, and mind\nThe proverbs we study this week will turn our attention inward. We’ll examine ourselves in light of the wisdom God’s Word provides on the topics of seduction and strength, health and happiness, adversity and anger, counsel and instruction, and humility and pride.\n//\nDay Eight: Seduction and Strength\nIt’s an image we’ve all seen, either on a movie screen or in our imaginations: a person faced with a decision stands conflicted, an angel whispering into one ear and a devil whispering into the other.\nAs fallen people in a fallen world, we should assume we are susceptible to seduction at any given moment. We should also assume that, for every situation we face, the wisdom of God is available to us if we ask. Both of these safe assumptions call for us to pay attention to the words of wisdom found in Scripture.\nThese proverbs call us to examine how seduction and strength work in our lives.\nSeduction\n\nProverbs 3:31-32\nDon’t envy a violent man\nor choose any of his ways;\nfor the devious are detestable to the Lord,\nbut He is a friend to the upright.\nProverbs 23:17\nDon’t let your heart envy sinners;\ninstead, always fear the Lord.\nProverbs 24:1-2\nDon’t envy evil men\nor desire to be with them,\nfor their hearts plan violence,\nand their words stir up trouble.\nProverbs 24:19-20\nDon’t be agitated by evildoers,\nand don’t envy the wicked.\nFor the evil have no future;\nthe lamp of the wicked will be put out.\nAsk\nQ. What is the most powerfully seductive voice speaking into your life right now? What is it promising that makes your heart want to follow?\nQ. With that answer in front of you, what is the deeper, God-given longing of your heart that lies beneath the desire you just named?\nQ. Who or what do you envy the most? How does envy distort the promises of God in our lives? \nStrength\nProverbs 14:26\nIn the fear of the Lord one has strong confidence\nand his children have a refuge.\nProverbs 18:10-11\nThe name of Yahweh is a strong tower;\nthe righteous run to it and are protected.\n11 A rich man’s wealth is his fortified city;\nin his imagination it is like a high wall.\nProverbs 20:29\nThe glory of young men is their strength,\nand the splendor of old men is gray hair.\nProverbs 25:28\nA man who does not control his temper\nis like a city whose wall is broken down.\nAsk\nQ. What are the strong towers you run to for refuge? Are any of them addictions? \nQ. What do you think Proverbs 25:28 means? Can you think of a time when you found this proverb to be true in your own life? \nQ. How would you put Proverbs 20:29 into your own words? \n\n                ",

We’re exploring topics such as the ways of wisdom and folly, the fear of God, what God commands, what God hates, and blessings and curses.\n//\nDay Five: Blessings and Curses\nFrom the time we are born, we learn that the decisions of life come with consequences. If a baby cries, she might get fed or changed. But if a toddler throws a tantrum, he might get a time-out. Consequences are not payments as much as they are the natural results of our actions.\nIn this life, we experience blessings and curses—consequences of choices we make or the choices others make that affect us. The preserving grace of God assures us that He is not temperamental or spiteful, but He does discipline His children. His discipline is for our flourishing because how we live and what we do matter in the here and now.\nThese proverbs value our present well-being without abandoning the biblical truth that love covers a multitude of sins.\nProverbs 3:33\nThe Lord’s curse is on the household of the wicked,\nbut He blesses the home of the righteous;\nProverbs 20:7\nThe one who lives with integrity is righteous;\nhis children who come after him will be happy.\nProverbs 28:20\nA faithful man will have many blessings,\nbut one in a hurry to get rich\nwill not go unpunished.\nProverbs 28:27\nThe one who gives to the poor\nwill not be in need,\nbut one who turns his eyes away\nwill receive many curses.\nAnd for fun:\nProverbs 27:14\nIf one blesses his neighbor\nwith a loud voice early in the morning,\nit will be counted as a curse to him.\nAsk\nQ.

We’re exploring topics such as the ways of wisdom and folly, the fear of God, what God commands, what God hates, and blessings and curses.\n//\nDay Four: The Commands of God\nImagine what this world would be like if God had chosen to be silent and distant from His creation. Imagine if He had not given us His Word to guide us. Imagine how lost and morally bankrupt we would be—how hopeless we would be when it comes to understanding our identity and worth.\nThough it is part of our sinful nature to rebel against God, His commands are more than mere rules. They are one of the primary ways He has drawn close and revealed His character. The commands of God help us to know who He is and what He values for the children He loves.\nConsider how these proverbs guide us in approaching God’s commands with wisdom.\nProverbs 4:1-4\n1 Listen, my sons, to a father’s discipline,\nand pay attention so that you may gain understanding,\n2 for I am giving you good instruction.\nDon’t abandon my teaching.\n3 When I was a son with my father,\ntender and precious to my mother,\n4 he taught me and said:\n“Your heart must hold on to my words.\nKeep my commands and live.”\nProverbs 6:20-23\n20 My son, keep your father’s command,\nand don’t reject your mother’s teaching.\n21 Always bind them to your heart;\ntie them around your neck.\n22 When you walk here and there, they will guide you;\nwhen you lie down, they will watch over you;\nwhen you wake up, they will talk to you.\n23 For a command is a lamp, teaching is a light,\nand corrective discipline is the way to life.\nProverbs 29:18\nWithout revelation people run wild,\nbut one who listens to instruction will be happy.\nProverbs 30:5\nEvery word of God is pure;\nHe is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.\nAsk\nQ. We have all inherited a sinful nature and, therefore, we cannot keep God’s commands perfectly. So, according to these proverbs, what purpose do His commands serve in the day-to-day life of a Christian? \nQ. Where do you find yourself “running wild” (Proverbs 29:18)? What drives this in us—this desire to live without law?\nQ. Is it possible to live without law? If we reject the Law of God and say “I live by no law,” is there still a law governing us? If so, what is it? \nQ. When was the last time you received “corrective discipline”? Are you one who willingly receives reproof? If so, under what circumstances and from whom? If not, why not? \n\n                ",

We’re exploring topics such as the ways of wisdom and folly, the fear of God, what God commands, what God hates, and blessings and curses.\n//\nDay Three: What God Hates\nOne of the most glorious overarching themes of the Bible is the astonishing love of God toward a rebellious and sinful people. This aspect of God’s nature is so wonderful because it plays out in every setting and circumstance—even in a broken world full of terrible things. To truly know God, and therefore truly walk in wisdom, we must know not only what God loves, but also what He abhors.\nConsider these proverbs about the things God hates.\nProverbs 6:16-19\n16 The Lord hates six things;\nin fact, seven are detestable to Him:\n17 arrogant eyes, a lying tongue,\nhands that shed innocent blood,\n18 a heart that plots wicked schemes,\nfeet eager to run to evil,\n19 a lying witness who gives false testimony,\nand one who stirs up trouble among brothers.\nProverbs 10:29\nThe way of the Lord is a stronghold for the honorable,\nbut destruction awaits the malicious.\nProverbs 11:1\nDishonest scales are detestable to the Lord,\nbut an accurate weight is His delight.\nProverbs 17:15\nAcquitting the guilty and condemning the just—\nboth are detestable to the Lord.\nProverbs 21:27\nThe sacrifice of a wicked person is detestable—\nhow much more so\nwhen he brings it with ulterior motives!\nProverbs 28:9\nAnyone who turns his ear away from hearing the law—\neven his prayer is detestable.\nAsk\nQ. Why do you think there are so many proverbs that talk about what God hates? Why is this important for us to know? \nQ. God hates abominations, but loves sinful people. When you are sinned against or are a witness to sin, is hatred something that rises up in you? If not, why do you think there’s no hatred? If so, what is your hatred directed at? How do these proverbs instruct us in how and what to hate? \nQ. Look at Proverbs 11:1. In what sense are we, as people, scales? Name at least one specific time you were a dishonest scale. How can we be “accurate weights”? \nQ. Look at Proverbs 28:9. What does the first half (turning our ears away from hearing the Law) have to do with the second (offering detestable prayers)?\n\n                ",

We’re exploring topics such as the ways of wisdom and folly, the fear of God, what God commands, what God hates, and blessings and curses.\n//\nDay Two: The Fear of God\nIn Genesis 31:42, Jacob referred to God as “The Fear.” What exactly does it mean to fear God? Does it mean cowering under a rock for fear that if He sees us, He will strike us down?\nWhen the Bible talks about “fearing God,” it means we should revere God as holy. Fearing God by revering Him as holy is not a posture of hiding; it is a posture of drawing near.\nConsider these proverbs that focus on fearing the Lord.\nThe Fear of God\nProverbs 3:7-8\n7 Don’t consider yourself to be wise;\nfear the Lord and turn away from evil.\n8 This will be healing for your body\nand strengthening for your bones.\nProverbs 8:13\nTo fear the Lord is to hate evil.\nI hate arrogant pride, evil conduct,\nand perverse speech.\nProverbs 19:23\nThe fear of the Lord leads to life;\none will sleep at night without danger.\nProverbs 23:17\nDon’t let your heart envy sinners;\ninstead, always fear the Lord.\nProverbs 31:30\nCharm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting,\nbut a woman who fears the Lord will be praised.\nAsk\nQ. What do you think it means to fear God in a way that actually cultivates intimacy between you and Him? \nQ. What does “Don’t consider yourself to be wise” (Proverbs 3:7) have to do with fearing God? \nQ. Where in your life does pride have its strongest hold? What is the difference between confidence and pride? \nQ. When you’ve found yourself “envying sinners” (Proverbs 23:17), what specifically do you envy? What does that envy reveal about what you revere? \n\n                ",

Instead, Proverbs lends itself well to a topical approach, which is how we have arranged this study.\nWe’ve gathered a selection of wisdom sayings from throughout the Book of Proverbs into daily thematic readings. Each day’s reading is followed by a short series of questions to help you grasp the meaning of the text and then apply that day’s wisdom to your own life. This study is meant to be contemplative—light on the quantity of verses but heavy on the thoughts, questions, and prayers that flow from them.\nAs you come to each day’s proverbs, read them several times. Linger over them. Read them out loud if that helps you absorb them. Take time to turn them over in your mind. Then use the questions provided to help you connect the day’s Scripture with your own life.\nGrace & Peace,\nThe He Reads Truth Team\n//\nSection One— God: Wisdom concerning the nature and values of God\nIn this first week of our study of Proverbs, we turn our attention upward to who God is and the wisdom He offers His people. We’ll explore topics such as the ways of wisdom and folly, the fear of God, what God commands, what God hates, and blessings and curses.\n//\nDay One— The Ways of Wisdom and Folly\nThe key foundational truth in Proverbs is this: to pursue wisdom is to pursue God, and to deny God is to walk in the way of a fool.\nWisdom is not just the accumulation of knowledge. It is a way we walk through life, seeking not only to know, but to interact with the truths of God. Folly, in the biblical sense of the word, is to hold the love and pursuit of truth in contempt by choosing to make our own path. A life of wisdom or folly comes from more than just the quality of the individual decisions we make. It comes from how we approach the journey of life as a whole.\nConsider these proverbs that describe the way of wisdom, and also the way of folly.\n\nThe Way of Wisdom\nProverbs 1:7-9\n7 The fear of the Lord\nis the beginning of knowledge;\nfools despise wisdom and discipline.\n8 Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction,\nand don’t reject your mother’s teaching,\n9 for they will be a garland of grace on your head\nand a gold chain around your neck.\nProverbs 2:1-12\n1 My son, if you accept my words\nand store up my commands within you,\n2 listening closely to wisdom\nand directing your heart to understanding;\n3 furthermore, if you call out to insight\nand lift your voice to understanding,\n4 if you seek it like silver\nand search for it like hidden treasure,\n5 then you will understand the fear of the Lord\nand discover the knowledge of God.\n6 For the Lord gives wisdom;\nfrom His mouth come knowledge and understanding.\n7 He stores up success for the upright;\nHe is a shield for those who live with integrity\n8 so that He may guard the paths of justice\nand protect the way of His loyal followers.\n9 Then you will understand righteousness, justice,\nand integrity—every good path.\n10 For wisdom will enter your mind,\nand knowledge will delight your heart.\n11 Discretion will watch over you,\nand understanding will guard you,\n12 rescuing you from the way of evil—\nfrom the one who says perverse things.\n\nAsk—\nQ. These words come near the beginning of the Book of Proverbs as a way to help us read everything that follows. What do these verses suggest is the goal of growing in wisdom?\nQ. According to these verses, what does wisdom give us?\nQ. What do you hope a month of studying God’s wisdom will produce in you?\n\nThe Way of Folly\nProverbs 3:35\nThe wise will inherit honor,\nbut He holds up fools to dishonor.\nProverbs 9:13-18\n13 The woman Folly is rowdy;\nshe is gullible and knows nothing.\n14 She sits by the doorway of her house,\non a seat at the highest point of the city,\n15 calling to those who pass by,\nwho go straight ahead on their paths:\n16 “Whoever is inexperienced, enter here!”\nTo the one who lacks sense, she says,\n17 “Stolen water is sweet,\nand bread eaten secretly is tasty!”\n18 But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there,\nthat her guests are in the depths of Sheol.\nProverbs 17:12\nBetter for a man to meet a bear robbed of her cubs\nthan a fool in his foolishness.\nProverbs 18:2\nA fool does not delight in understanding,\nbut only wants to show off his opinions.\n\nAsk—\nQ. Proverbs 9:13-18 describes folly as being secretive about our sin. Why is being secretive about sin foolish, and what is the value of letting trusted friends know the secrets in our lives?\nQ. Look at Proverbs 18:2. What is the difference between understanding and expressing your own heart?\nQ. What does it look like to “delight in understanding”? On what sorts of occasions do you do this in your life?\n\n                ",

We’ve been told for years in the Church that real marriages and relationships look nothing like what Hollywood depicts, and I think there is truth in that. But what I think we’ve heard sometimes in between the lines is that true Christian love is emotionless. We’ve been told it’s virtuous, dutiful, and righteous; but I think somewhere along the way we’ve come to overly distrust the emotional aspects of a marriage relationship.\nThe Princess Bride came out 30 years ago, but if you’ve never seen it, don’t let that be an excuse. It taps into some of the most essential and transcendent themes of the human experience, and it’s witty as all get-out. Plus, I’d be willing to wager you’ve missed at least a joke or two in your lifetime as it’s possibly one of the most quotable movies ever made. Inconceivable!\nWhat the film gets right is the same thing that the Teacher is imploring us to remember in Song of Songs 8:6: the enduring power of love. Solomon proclaims: “love is as strong as death; ardent love is unrelenting as Sheol. Love’s flames are fiery flames—the fiercest of all.” Kind of puts Shakespeare to shame. Yes, this is a poetic statement, but it seems experientially true that love really does surpass the powers of death. I’m sure each of us can think of a friends or family members who have passed through the thin veil into eternity, but we still love them. Objectively speaking, their physical bodies have been overcome by death, but that cannot vanquish our love for them.\nThe type of love Solomon describes feels like a fire burning in the pit of your stomach. It makes you do crazy, risky, and potentially embarrassing things for the sake of your beloved. The richness of God-given emotion is what drives us to action. We see in the teachings of Jesus that these actions must be tethered to the clear and careful instruction of God’s Word, but I think Song of Songs describes an enviable level of passion and poetic dedication to hold high the power of love. \nSong of Songs is a testament that God created love on purpose and that His Spirit animates us with a sense of passion for our brides. God’s love certainly is far more powerful than death. As His Spirit lives and breathes in each of us, we have the opportunity to confront death and proclaim the enduring power of holy love each and every day. We do this by loving those we have, and those we’ve lost, hopeful for the coming, glorious reunion that awaits all those who are in Christ.\nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Just about every man remembers the first time he got “the talk”—that awkward introduction to “the birds and the bees.” These talks are usually embarrassing because Dad or Mom (or son) is painfully uncomfortable even broaching the subject.\nIn the same way, it can be uncomfortable to read or write about the Song of Songs because the imagery is often overtly sexual. At times it feels like God accidentally let some French poet slip a few excerpts of his romantic verse into the pages of Scripture. Indeed, Song of Songs is so graphic that Jewish kids were not allowed to read it until they were 13 years old.\nBut here we are, my friends. And we are in a passage that fits that bill. Here, it seems Shulamith is taking significant romantic initiative toward her husband. If you didn’t know the historical context, you might think she’s whisking him away on a weekend trip to Napa Valley. This scene is full of intimate dialogue and straight-up seduction on the part of the wife. How do we read a passage like this? \nAny time marriage is discussed in the Bible, we should first remember that marriage reflects Christ’s love for His Church (Ephesians 5-22-33). As a picture of the gospel, marriage is always saying something about God.\nSo when we come across passages like these, we should perhaps move into what feels like even more awkward territory and dwell on how the intimacy between these two lovers reflects the relationship between Christ and His bride, the Church.\nNotice that throughout Scripture, there is a call for men to lead and initiate in marriage. As Christ is the servant-leader to His bride, so His bride is a servant-helper to her Husband. This doesn’t mean, of course, that the bride has no role to play in cultivation and initiation. In the same way, Christ’s bride is not merely a passive recipient of devotion or love. No, we’re active participants.\nMore than a sex talk, this passage joins others in calling us to seek and pursue Christ as active agents in discipleship (Proverbs 8:17; Psalms 27:8; Matthew 7:7-8; Acts 17:27; Hebrews 11:6; et al.). As Luther said, “We’re saved by faith alone, but not by a faith that is alone.” As Shulamith ferociously pursues her husband, we should also ferociously pursue Christ.\nWritten By Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Okay, I’ll admit it. When I was around 12 years old, I would often read the Song of Songs during church. There wasn’t a whole lot else to do, I thought. It was a brilliant plan because not only was I reading something just as explicit as Dr. Ruth’s radio show, there was the added bonus of getting credit for reading the Bible.\n“Look at Brother Pastor Redmond’s son. He may not be listening to the sermon but at least he is reading the Bible!”\nThey had no idea.\nThen I grew up a little and was taught that chapter 7 was “not really” about red-blooded sex. It was a picture—albeit an R-rated one—pointing to our relationship to Christ as the Church. I didn’t see it, but I trusted those teaching me in Sunday School and from the pulpit and in all the books. But it was all so disappointing. And more than a little weird.\nThen I got married and went to seminary. I will never forget the day my Psalms and Wisdom professor told us, in no uncertain terms, that this book was nothing other than a romantic love poem. Not only was this one of my better days in seminary, it confirmed those early instincts that this poem was the real deal. This was a man dreaming about the body of his wife.\nI’m 45 years old and have been teaching Scripture for most of my life now, and I still cannot believe this is in the Holy Bible. But I also have grown to see something that does take a little imagination.\nWhile Song of Songs is most certainly a love poem, maybe—like every other love poem, love song, and love story we know—it is also a reverse echo of the great love story of Christ and His bride, the Church. Paul makes the link clear in Ephesians 5 when he compares the relationship between Christ and the Church to the relationship between husbands and wives. That’s a pretty big comparison to make.\nThink about it. Christ looks at the Church the way a loving husband looks at his bride. Follow me here: Christ loves the Church the way the husband in Song of Songs loves his bride. Christ’s relationship with the Church, while not sexual, is still all the more intense and real. He looks at us and loves us.\nLet me say that again, because it is really hard to believe on many of our days. Christ looks at His people and loves what He sees.\nAll the great love stories by Austen, Dickens, and Berry are pointing to this. All the great love songs by Willie, Cash, and Merle are pointing to this. And all the great love poems of Shakespeare and Auden and Donne are pointing to this reality: Christ, who loved us and gave Himself up on the cross for us, looks at us and sees a bride worthy of His love.\nWritten By Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    God is the God of literature, even of love poetry. He is the God of romance, even of the most intimate relations between a man and his wife. From the very beginning, God created us male and female. Why should we be surprised that God would inspire love poetry? The words in the Song of Songs are breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16). So what do they tell us?\nGod gives us this love poem to drive us to His design for true romance. God’s design is not promiscuous. The celebration of marital intimacy is neither to be frowned upon nor exploited for unseemly purposes. While the Song of Songs is intimate, it is not vulgar. Indeed, the expressed mutual delight between the lovers is presented in the context of marital fidelity. The central declaration is this: I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine.\nThe images in this passage reinforce this theme of intimate fidelity. The garden, while sensually evocative, is also full of Edenic overtones. Gardens are places of life, fruitfulness, and intimacy. There Adam walked with Eve and also with God. There Christ visits with His people—the Bridegroom calling to His bride. The bride is also said to be as lovely as Jerusalem, the city of God. The hills, full of the shepherd’s livestock, are both abundant and endearing. The descriptions are local, tied to familiar places of hearth and home, of those things dearest to the heart. \nIn a world of wandering eyes and wayward affections, God calls me to fidelity. He calls me to love my wife well, having eyes for her alone. She is my darling, my treasured one. This passage drives that home. As Adam sang his love song to Eve in the garden, as he celebrated her as “flesh of my flesh and bone of my bones” (Genesis 2:23), as the beloved delights in his lover, his dove, his perfect one, so also is every husband to woo his wife and remain faithful to her.\nIn the Song of Songs, God provides us with a rich celebration of faithful love between the bridegroom and the bride. The central declaration of the gospel is this: I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine. This mystery is profound, as Paul remarks, and it refers to Christ and the church (Ephesians 5:32).\nWritten By Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I have a recurring dream—a nightmare of sorts. It usually comes on a Saturday night when I have some important responsibility at church the following morning. In the dream, no matter how hard I try, I cannot get to the church. And the obstacles that prevent me are the strange stuff of dreams. I get into a cab (which I never do) that has to stop by a different city first. Or there is an apocalyptic traffic jam, and I have to run over the tops of cars. Or, my favorite, the church I go to is the wrong church, even though it is my church, because no one told me we moved.\nDreams are weird. I am not the sort of person who thinks there’s some deep hidden meaning underneath everything that flies through our heads while we’re sleeping. But I do believe our dreams often are the result of the untangling of our consciences. Our worries, fears, hopes, and longings all show up—some to a great, cartoonish effect and others to nightmarish terror. But they do show up, don’t they?\nToday’s passage in Song of Songs is, many scholars believe, a description of a dream. It is the couple’s wedding night. They are in bed and she has a nightmare, which she introduces by saying, in effect, “I’m asleep, but my heart is awake, and it hears a knocking at the door” (my paraphrase of 5:2).\nIn her dream, her lover is outside knocking, asking her to let him in. In a haze of sleep, she offers excuses for why she can’t get out of bed—she’s naked and doesn’t want to get cold, she just washed her feet and doesn’t want to get them dirty. But soon, still in her dream, she warms to his presence and gets up to let him in. But when she opens the door he is gone. She panics. Has he left her to find another lover? She goes out into the night searching for him, and in her nightmare, the city watchmen find her and beat her (5:7). The worst thing that could have happened has happened. She has lost her lover on their wedding night, and her refusal to let him come inside played a part in her loss. She is sick with love.\nWhy has such a nightmare made its way into one of the greatest love poems ever written? Because her fear is a terror everyone can relate to. Will I push you away to the point that you leave me? Will I treasure my own comfort over letting you in?\nThese fears are rooted in many things. One is the false belief that the strength of love is found in the intensity of romantic passion. Young lovers fear what will happen if the wedding-night intensity fades. But deeply rooted love takes work. It is good work, but work nonetheless. Colossians 3:12-17 describes the work. It is the work of forgiving, the work of celebrating, the work of listening, the work of growing in wisdom, the work of maturing in Christ together.\nThe truth is, no matter how dark the nightmare goes, the Bridegroom is not really gone. He is right there, beside the one He loves. And He is there because He made a covenant to never leave and never forsake. \nMay God wake us from the nightmare that denies the possibility of such a love. And may we come to trust the faithfulness of God, even if our deepest fear is the fear of being left alone.\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    There have been attempts, over the years, to try and unearth the Song of Songs—to take it out of the realm of flesh and blood and sex and love, and place it in some super spiritual realm of heady disembodied thought. For the life of me, I have never understood such attempts. They just seem weird, and sorta sad.\nSong of Songs chapter 4 presents The Man at the height of his focused powers, giving full attention to The Woman. And although I’ve no doubt he appreciated her wit and intelligence and sense of humor, this chapter is more about the curves of her body and the spicy contours of her flesh. This is essentially John Mayer singing “Your Body Is A Wonderland.” Don’t think so? Read it again. He engages in a literal head-to-toe cataloguing of her physical features, listing with increasing poetic energy everything from her fragrance, to her smile, to her neck and her breasts. Yeah, so much for thinking disembodied thoughts, right?\nThe beautiful thing here is that this is a wonderful Scriptural affirmation of what both The Man and The Woman enjoyed on their wedding night—one another’s bodies. Are there spiritual realities afoot when a man and woman come together like that? Absolutely. But do those spiritual realities somehow exclude the possible physical pleasures? Not in Song of Songs chapter 4. Those two aspects are wedded, and it appears God is quite pleased with it all.\nIt is not lost me that the partner doing most of the talking in this chapter is The Man. That’s not to say that The Woman doesn’t take a turn, for she does in chapter 5. But in this chapter we hear from his voice. And what we hear is a husband painting a verbal portrait I’m willing to bet most women would kill to hear. Sadly, many never do.\nSure, most of us are not the lyrical type. But that doesn’t mean that we can’t take a few cues from The Man and risk complimenting our wives on their physical beauty. I say “risk” because while her body is a wonderland, it can also be a minefield of past wounds and possibly even abuse. So be gentle.\nWhat’s the best way to start? The Man gives us a great opening line: You are so beautiful!\nWritten By John Blase\n\n                ",

I was asking myself, Can you really do this? Can you take care of her?\nI’m sure others wondered this about me as well. The people at our wedding did not only expect to see the bride; they were also looking to me. I was the man who was saying I would take on the responsibility to provide for and love this woman with everything I had. And if I didn’t have what that took, I would do whatever was necessary to acquire it. I felt like all eyes were on me, along with a lot of expectations.\nHad I let them, my fears and expectations would have paralyzed me, leaving me unable to live out the great joy and honor of being a husband. I wanted people to see in me the ability to commit to this woman forever. This is what a groom is supposed to feel—a determination to love and provide, no matter what. And this is how Christ loves the Church—with an unwavering commitment.\nSong of Song 3:6-11 describes the commitment of the groom. He will give everything he has to take care of his bride. For Christians, the groom is Jesus, who perfectly commits to His beloved and to her heart because He alone has the character and strength to do it.\nWe don’t just need the example of Jesus; we need to know the reality of His love for us. When we see the perfect Groom, we learn what it looks like to be faithful and loving in all of our relationships. Because of Jesus, we can rest secure in knowing that God our Father has equipped us with what we need to provide for our families and love the people in our lives well.\nJesus is preparing a place in His Father’s house for us, where we will dwell with Him for all eternity. We can look to Jesus, seeing His faithfulness and character, and be confident that He can love us and provide us with all we need. He is making a home for us.\nWith great joy a man stands up at his wedding, committing all of himself to the flourishing of the woman he loves. So it is with our Lord. Jesus Christ, with great joy, loves us at the expense of Himself, and He gives us everything we need to find our home with Him. \nMay we follow with our eyes fixed on Jesus—our example and the One who gives us the strength to give our lives away in love.\nWritten By Jevon Washington\n\n                ",

On most days, the goal is just to keep things as normal as possible. But when love overtakes you, normal just won’t work any more. The desire to love and to be loved is deeply embedded in each of us, and it drives us to want more and more from love.\nToday’s reading from Solomon’s story of love describes the longing the woman has for the man, the soon-to-be bride for her soon-to-be husband. Here is a dream about their longing to be fully together on their wedding night—a glorious night of passion and care for each other, a night where they fully embrace each other, a night which marks the beginning of their shared, vulnerable life together.\nThis longing is heightened because of their faithfulness to “not stir up or awaken love until it pleases” (3:5). They want to do things in the proper order. Faithfulness and self-control are marks of great love. To wait out the intensity of our longings is to model our sacrifice for each other, which includes the daily work of loving each other in the normal, boring parts of life as well as in seasons of heightened romance and passion.\nMarriage to the one you love is a commitment to sacrifice. The days of waiting described here are part of the reality of loving someone. We can’t always get what we want when we want it. Marriage is the work of loving and serving and waiting, anticipating the ultimate fulfillment of marriage—the return of Jesus and the marriage supper of the Lamb. For young lovers, it can seem like the ultimate longing is just for the wedding night. But the more the two become one, the more they long to intimately wait together for Jesus to return. \nIn love, the work is often the waiting. The Christian life is a string of days spent waiting for the return of the One who loves us best. And if we love Him, those days will be filled with longing.\nWritten By Jason Tippetts\n\n                ",

Or the thrill in the woman’s heart when she knows he has bought the ring but hasn’t yet proposed. Anticipation.\nYou know the feeling, right? It seems like an almost disproportionate desire for the thing you actually want. It’s the feeling when a longing outpaces the value of the thing you desire, and yet, the desire remains and sometimes even grows. Why does this happen?\nToday’s text from the Song of Songs is filled with a longing for something to happen—for the lover and the beloved to finally be together. She hears his voice over the distant hills, but cannot see him. She wants him to run, to hurry. The setting is perfect: the winter is past, the rains are gone, and the flowers are opening. It is the perfect spring day and romance is in the air.\nFinally, he arrives. He tells her to stand up so they can explore the countryside together. It is like something out of a musical—a young man and a young woman dancing and singing across the fields in bloom. They are in love.\nBut in the midst of their joyous union, they eventually turn to the hard realities of life. This world can be a tough place. They talk about how as they dance, they need to also take time to chase away the foxes that ruin their vineyards (2:10). They talk about how the shadows will come and the day will grow dark. This is the reality of the life they know. \nThey want their day of romance in the spring meadow to be a dance that will last forever, but it won’t. And yet, the longing is there—and that longing came from someplace. So it is with us. We all have insatiable longings for a perfect love that goes on and on and on without interruption, and that desire comes from someplace. Where?\nC.S. Lewis wrote, “If I find in myself desires which nothing in this world can satisfy, the only logical explanation is that I was made for another world.” The Apostle Paul said it like this: “For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known” (1 Corinthians 13:12).\nBecause of the finished work of Christ, the day will come when we will dance freely without having to keep one eye on the foxes. But for now we can rest in this: our longings often feel disproportionate to the thing we desire because that thing we desire is only a foretaste of what we really want most—to have all we need, at peace with our Maker and at rest in our eternal home. \nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

I’ve learned never to tell our children the birthday or Christmas presents I got for my wife. They can’t help it; the secret erupts out of them.\nLove is meant to burst out of us. In Song of Songs, we see love on high-definition display. There is no hidden love in this book. This is one of the first things we learn about love from the Song of Solomon: love isn’t meant to be a secret. Solomon sings of his love for his bride, and she returns with songs of love for her suitor. Love is supposed to rise to the surface, billowing from the heart, perfuming the way we speak, serve, and live.\nLove is meant to be displayed. Love is something we do. As Paul shows us in 1 Corinthians 13, love is patient in the face of impatience. Love is kind when tempted toward anger. Love isn’t rude. Love doesn’t keep a record of wrongs done by your wife, kids, friends, or co-workers. Love is visible and active.\nIt isn’t unmanly to make our love known. We see God’s love for us in the cross of Jesus Christ: “God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16). Jesus’ love for us is made known in His cross when Paul describes Him as “the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me” (Galatians 2:20). In fact, Solomon and his bride aren’t the only ones moved to sing because of love. God sings over us. “The Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; He will rejoice over you with gladness; He will quiet you by His love; He will exult over you with loud singing” (Zephaniah 3:17).\nGod doesn’t hide His love for us. Let’s not hide our love for Him. Let’s not hide our love for others. Let’s love God with all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love our neighbors as ourselves. May it be with a love we’re unable to contain.\nWritten By J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

He was faithful to deliver the message God gave him, even when it was at his expense.\nNow he must trust God not only with the present, but also the future. Daniel asked a question many of us have also asked. What am I to do in light of everything I have seen? How long will this go on?\nI am a person who craves being “in the know.” I want to be well informed and ready for whatever happens. If I’m honest, I want to be in the know because it requires me to have less faith. Knowledge becomes my idol. I assume knowledge will grant peace.\nThe messenger to Daniel reminded him that it is not being in the know that grants us peace, but knowing God and His Word.\nPeter also reminded us of this in his letter to the early church, writing, “Dear friends, don’t let this one thing escape you: With the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day. The Lord does not delay His promise, as some understand delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance” (2 Peter 3:8-9).\nGod’s timing is not ours, and His knowledge is above ours. We may long for answers, especially when circumstances are dire. Even then, God does not delay His promise.\nwritten by Britton Sharp\n\n                ",

I have come because of your prayers.”\n-Daniel 10:12\nI don’t always understand what happens or why. This past year has been hard with the tragic loss of a great friend. Sometimes the magnitude of the anxiety, sadness, or stress has left me lying on the bathroom floor in the fetal position. Those are the moments we long for hope—moments when everything seems fearfully dark.\nIn today’s reading, we see Daniel overwhelmed by what he has been shown. It caused a physical response in him, and he looked to the ground, speechless.\nWhen he encountered God’s messenger, Daniel asked, “How can someone like me, your servant, speak with someone like you, my lord? Now I have no strength, and there is no breath in me” (Daniel 10:17).\nI have asked that question myself, lying on the floor in grief and sorrow. I see the path before me and I am made aware of the magnitude of my inadequacy.\nThe messenger answered, “Don’t be afraid, you who are treasured by God. Peace to you; be very strong!” (Daniel 10:19).\nGod will supply us where He has called us. As believers, our power to persevere comes not from within us but from God. We are inadequate, but we serve a God who has no limits.\nHope may not be within my grasp but it is never beyond God’s, for He is the very source of hope. Daniel is shown the rise and fall of kings and kingdoms in these chapters, yet the point of it all is that there is hope. God is the Everlasting King, and He is sovereign and in control.\nI must hide these truths within my heart so that when life is overwhelming, I will remember: my God is never overwhelmed.\n“I have told you these things so that in Me you may have peace. You will have suffering in this world. Be courageous! I have conquered the world.”\n– John 16:33\n\n                ",

I am guessing that if you have made it this far in Daniel, you are realizing just how wildly written this little book really is. It reminds me of Revelation with its imagery, visions, and stories that seem to tinker right on the edge of lunacy. This is one reason Daniel is overlooked by many Bible readers, or filtered though and picked to pieces by others. \nFor those who want something clear and distinct, Daniel appears chaotic. For those wanting to wade in the waters of mystery, Daniel is right up their alley. But what can Daniel teach all of us about living lives dedicated to God?\nIn reading today’s passage, I am reminded of the season of Lent, one of my favorite parts of the liturgical calendar. In my Christian tradition we sort of go over the top with this particular Christian season. We put ashes on our heads, we fast, we repent, and we remind ourselves of the great distance between God’s character and ours. In Lent, we practice praying in a different kind of way. In today’s passage, Daniel teaches us not only how to pray, but how to repent. He reminds us how to come to the God of mercy who is so quick to bridge that distance. \nListen to the words Daniel uses in speaking to God: We have sinned. We have acted wickedly. We have rebelled. We have not listened. These are the words of an honest man who doesn’t make light of sin. This is a prayer that cuts out the fluff.  \nNow, listen to what Daniel asks God to do: Let your anger turn away. Listen to the pleas for mercy. Hear me. Open your eyes. Forgive, pay attention, and act. These seem like strong words for someone who has admitted his people have rebelled and acted wickedly. But, here is the key: Daniel is able to pray—and you are able to pray in this way—not because of who you are, but because of who God is. He is a God of great mercy.\nWhen Jesus began preaching in Mark 1, His first words were, “Repent, for the Kingdom of God is coming!” This was more of an invitation than a warning. Repenting is the first step in our move toward God. We should do it daily, reminding ourselves of who we are and who God is. \nDo we often come to God asking only for Him to meet our needs? Do we only come when things aren’t going so well? \nDaniel shows us a different way to pray, a way that opens up our lives to the Kingdom of God.\nwritten by Aaron Wright\n\n                ",

Should I take this job? Which school am I supposed to go to? What’s next for me? In the questions and uncertainties of life, I often feel confused. When I read this chapter of Daniel, I see that I am in good company. \nMaybe you read through this chapter and were confused, like me, by the vision and even the interpretation of the vision. That’s okay—Daniel was confused too. God was unfolding for him events that were to take place in the future but made little sense to him at the time. \nThe vision, though confusing, is good news for Daniel and all believers who have ever suffered at the hands of earthly kingdoms: only God’s Kingdom will last. On top of this, it offers us a lesson not to look at the troubling circumstances in front of us as insurmountable, but to instead look to the Author and Shepherd of all history and trust in His plan. As Romans 8:38-39 says, “we have confidence that nothing in the present or future can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.” \nThat means whatever we are going through at this moment, although it may be difficult, is only temporary. In the end, we “are more than victorious through Him who loved us” (Romans 8:37). This is where the Christian can find joy no matter what trial or pain he is going through. In Christ, our joy is anchored in the everlasting promise of the love of God. \nWe will have moments of confusion in our faith. Daniel admits to this in verse 27. He had to stop everything he was doing because it literally made him sick. But soon after, he got up and continued going about the king’s business even when he didn’t understand the full purposes of God.\nThere have been times I have felt sick when I don’t understand what was going on in the world around me. But just like Daniel, we must carry on for the sake of the heavenly Kingdom. Even when we don’t see how God is working in a situation, our job is to remain faithful while His job is to work out the details. Many times we pray to God asking Him to reveal what lies ahead, and then we will be faithful. But what God asks of us is to be faithful no matter what lies ahead. We don’t have to know everything in order to do what God calls us to.\nWhen confusion enters into our lives, where will we run? Could our desire for clarity actually be our fleshly desire for comfort instead of faith? Am I willing to go about God’s work even when it doesn’t all make sense?\n \nwritten by Chandler Vannoy\n\n\n                ",

Seriously.  \nGood, let’s begin. Daniel 7 is one of those chapters in the Bible where I think we can get all twisted and jumbled. Many of us don’t have a context for this kind of passage. If we try to twist it to make sense in our world, it doesn’t really work. We have to imagine a different world, One in which we find ourselves in desperate need of salvation from powers and empires wishing to devour us, crush us, stamp us out. Only then does it begin to make sense. This vision does come as good news. It sounds incredibly thrilling and hopeful, yet terrifying—all at the same time.  \nI remember going to the theatre fifteen years ago wanting to be like the Gladiator. It was my favorite movie that year. I loved thinking of myself placing my fist over my heart and saying, “Strength and honor.” Or, in other words, power and glory. I knew then the significance of those words. They were the calling card for the Roman army; it was their way of distinguishing themselves from everyone else. \nRome was an empire bent on stamping out anything and everything in its way, an empire of power and glory. But, Rome isn’t here anymore. Neither is Babylon, or Persia, or Assyria. The empires have passed away.  \nThe promise Daniel 7 is that a Kingdom is coming that will not pass away. Daniel is not simply telling a wild story to incite unfounded hope; he is pointing to God’s plan to rescue all of us (every people, nation, and language) from the empires and dominions of this world (Daniel 7:13-14, Rev. 5:9). \nIt begins with a different kind of King, a King who comes on the clouds of heaven. This is not a mere mortal— this is One who has been given authority to rule and reign.\nIf you find yourself reading the Gospels anytime soon, look at how people respond to Jesus. He is one who has real authority. He is the Son of Man, the one who speaks of the true Kingdom. Then pray the Lord’s Prayer (Matt. 6:9-13). And when you come to the end of that prayer, place your right hand over your chest. Say those words that Daniel and his listeners longed to say and that Christ taught us to pray: “For thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, Forever and Ever. Amen.”\nwritten by Aaron Wright\n\n                ",

Come to think of it, I’m not entirely sure why we so often tell it to small children, considering that the story ends with lions devouring whole families. More than a children’s Bible lesson, however, Daniel’s ordeal is a study of perseverance in the face of persecution. Sadly, the persecution of God’s people is very much a reality in many parts of our world today, places where faithfulness to Christ could come at the expense of one’s life. \nDaniel’s faithfulness to God had endured the longevity of the Babylonian Empire and was now extending into the burgeoning Medo-Persian Empire with its current ruler, King Darius. Once again, Daniel found himself at the right hand of a ruler who was learning that God is ruler of heaven and earth and His “kingdom shall never be destroyed” (Daniel 6:26). \nWhen he learned of the Darius’ decree, Daniel’s faithfulness to God found its outworking in the continued rhythm of daily prayer and thankfulness (Daniel 6:10). Daniel was a man accustomed to persecution, but even more accustomed to perseverance. He had learned to live in the Kingdom of God in the midst of exile. \nAs Daniel was being cast into the lions’ den, Darius proclaimed what can only be called a hopeful blessing upon Daniel: “May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!” (Daniel 6:16). This was at once affirmation of Daniel’s faithfulness and God’s power. \nFor most of us, we will never face hungry lions because we confess the name of Jesus. But, lest we become comfortable, 1 Peter 5:8-9 tells us that there is a lion on the prowl that is seeking to devour us. Much like Daniel’s perseverance, Peter instructs us to resist the Devil, stand firm in our faith, and stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Christ throughout the world who are being persecuted. \nWhat you would do if you were in Daniel’s position? Would you maintain your allegiance to Christ in the face of death? It’s a difficult question, to be sure. \nBefore moving on to the reflection questions, take a moment to pray for perseverance for our brothers and sisters in Christ who are reading this passage around the world and experience this persecution as reality.\nwritten by Chris Comstock\n \n\n                ",

And at this point in my life, I hope there is some significant character resemblance. I recognize this is not the case for all men, but my father has shown me what it means to walk humbly before God and trust Him for my life. \nIn Daniel Chapter 5, we are abruptly introduced to King Belshazzar, a stand-in for his father King Nabonidus and hence the successor to King Nebuchadnezzar. The situation was politically complicated, but the point is that Belshazzar walked in the footsteps—or, missteps—  of his predecessor and “father” Nebuchadnezzar.\nBelshazzar, in his great pride, threw a lavish party and decided to bring out all the golden vessels that were pillaged from the temple in Jerusalem and use them like the red plastic cups you would find at a college party. The partygoers praised Babylon’s false gods, the whole scene amounting to a direct provocation and blaspheming of the God of Israel. Between all this and the unsettling incident with the handwriting on the wall, this was no ordinary party.\nThe focus of this passage, and the message Daniel so vividly delivered to Belshazzar, is that the Most High God is the One to whom all honor and glory are due. Trust in any false god the world puts forth, including oneself, is futile. In his pride, Belshazzar had “lifted himself up against the Lord of heaven” (5:22) and was now being brought low as a result. Like father, like son.\nAs followers of Jesus we are exhorted in 1 John 2:15-17, to not love the world or the things belonging to the world. This “world-love” has its distinguishing marks: the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and pride in one’s lifestyle. If we are honest, we all struggle with these. It is not only Babylonian kings who love the “world.”\nIn reality, all of our lives bear the marks of world-love. All of us have scars that remind us how lust and pride make our lives smaller, not larger. But each of us, no matter our circumstance, is invited to bring our lives to God in repentance, so that love for Christ can swallow up our love for the world.\nTake a moment to reflect on the ways Jesus, the Son, lifts up and honors the Father. Like Jesus, may we as sons pattern our lives after our heavenly Father.\nwritten by Chris Comstock\n\n                ",

The flip side of that fear is pride. We tend to have an unrealistic view of our own sufficiency, priding ourselves on being self-sustaining. This belief is in direct opposition to how God created and designed us. \nThe story of Nebuchadnezzar is the story of one man’s battle with pride. What is especially interesting about today’s passage is that it is written by Nebuchadnezzar himself. The narrative switches to the first person voice of the king, who describes his interaction with the God of Daniel, the God that ultimately becomes the focus of the king’s praise (Daniel 4:34-37).\nChapter 4 opens with another of Nebuchadnezzar’s dreams, and Daniel is once again called on to interpret. I have to wonder how Daniel felt in this situation. He is speaking with the current ruling king— the king of a nation who captured his people— and the message Daniel has to deliver is not exactly a pleasant one. Through Daniel, God reveals to Nebuchadnezzar that unless he humbles himself, he will be torn down. Daniel chooses to share this truth rather than manufacturing something that might please the king, and not out of spite but out of concern. So many times we wish ill for those with power over us, but God’s desire is for repentance and restoration. Daniel shares God’s desire— that Nebuchadnezzar will follow Him—and in grace, he tells the king the truth of what will happen if he does not.\nAs Nebuchadnezzar gains in power, he becomes more convinced of his self sustainability. Sometimes success is the worst thing for us. The king allows his success to blind him of the reality of his need for God.\nNebuchadnezzar reaps the consequences of his pride. He is humbled. Though painful, humbling can lead to healing. God humbles Nebuchadnezzar, and in that breaking of his pride comes repentance.\nIn taking his eyes of of himself, Nebuchadnezzar is able to see the majesty the true King, the God of Daniel.\nIn our brokenness we can either turn to bitterness or repentance. Nebuchadnezzar’s story is a beautiful picture of repentance.\nAt times we may wonder why God doesn’t allow gains in different areas of our lives. Could it be that He is protecting us from ourselves and our tendency to forget Him?\nMay we keep our eyes on the true King. May we not think too highly of ourselves, but when we do, may we respond to our breaking with repentance and not bitterness. May our stories point to the one true King: “For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom is from generation to generation” (Daniel 4:34b).\nwritten by Chandler Vannoy and Britton Sharp\n\n                ",

Usually, if not always, these things fall well short of their hype. They don’t enhance our life. They don’t fill us with awe. They disappoint.  \nI imagine the image Nebuchadnezzar built would have been labeled as something spectacular, something worth our time and attention. It was a massive golden statue that stood roughly 90 feet tall. It probably was the “most amazing thing” anyone of the time could have imagined. All the empire was summoned to come and fall before this manmade image and bear witness to its grandeur. But this wasn’t just a “click and see” kind of call for attention. This was a requirement of loyalty to the empire— a requirement to worship Nebuchadnezzar’s magnificent statue and his false gods. \nAs we continue to read Daniel, we will begin to see how the role of earthly empire collides with the promise of God’s Kingdom. God’s Kingdom brings life. It reveals the God of mercy. Empire reveals itself as nothing but crumbling stone.  \nIn this particular passage, God takes the faithfulness and obedience of three young men and makes it a signpost of the true King and Kingdom. These three young men believed that what they did not see was far greater than what they could see. They believed that what (or rather, Who) they could not see demanded of them complete and total allegiance and obedience, above and beyond any earthly kingdom. We often talk of striving for excellence, which happens to be measured by something we can create (much like an excellent statue). But God calls us to something deeper than that: God calls us to obedience.  \nIt is in our obedience that we discover, as the three young men did, that faithfulness to God reveals the actual most amazing thing ever: His presence. Even with all of culture and empire breathing down your neck, obedience to the true King is the real test of faith. It is through hearts that are obedient, even unto death, that God transforms the world. He did it through these three men. He did it through Jesus Christ. And He calls us to the same. \nDon’t get caught up in the world of manmade excellence and the temporarily spectacular. Instead, be obedient to the only One who can give you the most amazing thing ever, Himself.\nwritten by Aaron Wright\n\n                ",

Generally we want to know what it holds for our own lives. For some of us this stems from simple curiosity, but for many others it is rooted in a desire to control outcomes. If we just knew we would one day be married or financially stable or healthy, then we could rest secure in the here and now.\nThis thought process is not too far from what Nebuchadnezzar was trying to do. In the ancient world, a king’s dreams held significance for the entire nation as they were thought to foreshadow future events. So if one could interpret a dream correctly, they could take appropriate actions to sustain their kingdom.\nConsider the lengths Nebuchadnezzar was willing to go to get a grasp on the future. Not only had he tasked his magicians and fortune-tellers with interpreting his dream’s meaning, but he also demanded they describe his own dream to him—under penalty of death!\nDaniel enters this life-threatening situation with a completely different perspective than his Babylonian counterparts. He knows he serves the God of heaven who not only writes history but reveals it. What is interesting to note is the main message of the dream: in the midst of rising and falling kingdoms, “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people…it shall stand forever” (Daniel 2:44). Simply put, the future is secure for all who trust and serve the world’s true King.\nThis passage convicts me because I recognize a bit of Nebuchadnezzar in myself. As I reflect on my own life, I find I’m guilty of the same impulse to control outcomes to favor my well being and satisfy my desires. In reality, my future security, happiness, satisfaction are ultimately not within my grasp. Granted, I can contribute to some of these realities. But my best contribution to my future and the future of those around me is to trust in God’s sovereign rule (Kingdom). The more trust I place in Him now, the more confident I can be in God’s plan for my future, even when it takes me through hardship.\nIs your desire to know and control the future battling against your allegiance to the God who writes the future? In what areas of your life do you need to offer up control of outcomes to King Jesus?\nwritten by Chris Comstock\n\n                ",

I also remember my dad praying with me in the car before I went in. Surprisingly, he didn’t pray I would get the job and he didn’t pray I would answer all the questions correctly. Rather, he prayed that the manager of the grocery store would show me favor and that I would demonstrate a strong work ethic.\nFaithfulness and favor— these two realities are what allowed Daniel and his friends to not only survive in Babylonian exile, but to flourish. In a foreign land, living in a strange culture with even stranger gods, and enrolled in the best education program Babylon had to offer, Daniel and his three comrades prioritized faithfulness to God above pursuit of success or status. Obedience to Yahweh’s statutes took precedence over the ways of Babylon.\nDaniel was seeking to be faithful to the God who had been faithful to him. This posture resulted in God blessing him and his friends with wisdom, knowledge, and the ability to interpret dreams (which will come in handy later, as we will see). These young men were blessed to the point that the King found them ten times better than all the Babylonian wise men and magicians (Daniel 1:20).\nLet’s pause a moment and reflect on an important distinction. We may be tempted to think Daniel somehow earned God’s blessing by what he did or didn’t do. I know many times I am tempted to think that way. But we need to remember that Daniel stands in symbolic contrast to the nation of Israel as a whole. God’s choosing Israel to be His people was an act of pure grace (favor), not a result of anything they had done. As God’s people, they were to reflect God’s character. If they were faithful to God, they would live in God’s blessing; but if they were not, they would be exiled (case in point). Daniel was merely doing what Israel was meant to do all along: trust, obey, and live out of the favor of God. The fruit of this was blessing.\nThis theme also appears in 1 Samuel 12:24: “Above all, fear the Lord and worship Him faithfully with all your heart; consider the great things He has done for you.” In short, prioritize faithfulness to God out of recognition of the favor he has already shown you.\nAs followers of Jesus, God’s favor is always being extended to us. The question is, will we will choose to live out of it—as a response to it—and let it permeate our lives?\nHow often do we reflect on “the great things He has done”? Do we live our lives as a response to the favor He has already shown us?\nMay we prioritize faithfulness to God and live our lives deeply rooted in His favor towards us in Christ.\nwritten by Chris Comstock\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Being a Christian can make for some uncomfortable social interactions. Those awkward moments can even show up in our discussions with friends — the fidgety part of the conversation where you have the choice to speak truth or hide it away.\nHow do you live according to the truth God has called you to in a world that believes otherwise? What about the times when what you believe inconveniences others?\nWhat does respectful righteousness and humility look like?\nIn the opening chapter of Daniel, we get a picture of respectful righteousness. Daniel drew a boundary: he would not eat the king’s food. Scripture says, “Daniel determined that he would not defile himself with the king’s food or with the wine he drank” (Daniel 1:8). Some think this is a dietary reference, but is it more than that. If Daniel did not put boundaries in place, would he then continue down the slippery slope of compromise?\nWe may assume Daniel didn’t like the food, but this was the king’s best (Daniel 1:5). Refusing it must have felt like being on a diet and seeing a big piece of chocolate cake — surely it was desirable to Daniel. But this was not just a food decision; it was a heart decision.\nWould accepting the king’s food lead to accepting the king’s views? Might Daniel start to believe all of the things thrown at him and lose track of who God had called him to be? Could it be not the body that is defiled, but the heart?\n“So [Daniel] asked permission from the chief official not to defile himself. God had granted Daniel favor and compassion from the chief official, yet he said to Daniel, ‘My lord the king assigned your food and drink. I’m afraid of what would happen if he saw your faces looking thinner than those of the other young men your age. You would endanger my life with the king.’” (Daniel 1:8b-10)\nDaniel respected his overseer. He asked permission; he didn’t demand. As we will see again in a few days, God granted him favor. Daniel realizes that his convictions could cause harm/issues for others, so he takes responsibility for those issues. \n“So Daniel said to the guard whom the chief official had assigned to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, “Please test your servants for 10 days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. Then examine our appearance and the appearance of the young men who are eating the king’s food, and deal with your servants based on what you see.” (Daniel 1:11-13)\nDaniel did not bully his way to having his convictions valued by others. Instead, he responded to God’s call, respectfully created space for God to work, and trusted. He did not try to overthrow the overseer; he reached out to him and talked with him. Daniel valued cultivating the relationship with the overseer, rather than conquering him to just get his way. He trusted in God’s sovereignty and refrained from trying to manipulate others into righteousness. \nHow are we living out that which God has called us to do? How might we learn respectful righteousness from the example of Daniel?\n \n\n                ",

I have always valued the fact that my name has meaning and symbolism for my family.\nIn the culture of the Ancient Near East, a name was synonymous with character. In much of scripture, after someone had an interaction with God, He would often change their name. It signified a change of character.\nIn Daniel 1:1-7, we can see that King Nebuchadnezzar valued these men. Notice the types of men he gathered; pay attention to what the king was doing. What do you think his plan was for this 3-year program that culminated in a name change?\nDaniel’s name in Hebrew means “My judge is God,” while his Babylonian name Belteshazzar meant “May Bel protect his life.” Hananiah (“Yahweh is gracious”) is changed to Shadrach (“The command of Aku”). Mishael (“Who is what God is?”) is changed to Meshach (“Who is what Aku is?”). Azariah (“Yahweh has helped”) is changed to Abednego (“Servant of Nebo”).\nIn changing the names of these men, Nebuchadnezzar hoped their character would also change. And maybe some of them did. Perhaps some of the Israelites began to think this exile thing wasn’t so bad after all.\nEven in exile, we still find ourselves with choices. Many are harmless, some are fatal. Why do you think Daniel accepted some parts of his new culture while, as we will see tomorrow, taking a stand against others? \nDaniel was not alone in his captivity; there were other men with him—men who understood his culture and his faith. What could be the significance of them going through this together?\nIn 1 Peter 2:11-12, Peter charges his fellow believers to abstain from fleshly desires that wage war against their soul. Like Daniel, Peter understood that walking with God is a battle that we must fight every day. It is not limited to times of physical exile but is a daily exercise of our faith in God, the one true King.\nMay we remember our true identity and citizenship today as sons of the true King, and may we resist those things which wage war against the ways of God.\n\n                ",

We have all at some point longed for a different outcome and are left with a reality we did not desire. \nThis is what we see the nation of Israel going through in today’s readings. In Psalm 137, we hear Israel wrestling with their ability to sing praise in the midst of captivity. When you read to the end of the Psalm, you actually see a prayer of harsh vengeance. What you don’t see is Israel address their hearts and how they fell away from God. \nThat is our tendency—the refusal to look at our heart, the refusal to take ownership of our need for the Gospel.\nIn Jeremiah 28, we see the prophet Hananiah use a different tactic: the tactic of denial. Hananiah’s words sound great, but he is a false prophet. Why? Because he still does not address the heart. Hananiah is extremely adamant and he and Jeremiah have a prophetic face-off. The false prophet promises a change of circumstance without acknowledging the need for a change of their hearts. \nSometimes my desire for different circumstances eclipses my desire to do what God is asking of me in my current ones. That is when I am most likely to believe false prophets— when they give easy fixes to hard heart issues. \nIn Chapter 29, Jeremiah goes where Hananiah wouldn’t — he addresses the heart. He points out how the people have wandered from God, and he deals with the reality that they will be in exile for awhile. But even in exile, in consequences of their sin, they can find God. \nWhen we find ourselves in exile, we can remember the promise God gives us:\nYou will call to Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart. I will be found by you”—this is the Lord’s declaration—“and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and places where I banished you.”\n– Jeremiah 29:12-14\nWill we search for God with all of our heart, or will be incessantly try to find easy fixes? Will we say we cannot praise God where He has put us, or will we deal with our hearts and flourish in the grace of the Gospel despite our circumstances?\n\n                ",

The reality is that we would and we probably have. All of us have the capacity to fall away and the potential to fail. That is why we need Jesus. \nIsrael had come to the point where their hearts were far from God. As you read through today’s passage, you can see them drift, one king to the next. One generation’s success does not ensure the faithfulness of the next. \nIsrael was a repeat offender, continually wandering from God. When we continue to wander, we find ourselves in exile. We reap the consequences of our choices. But the story does not end there. Our failures do not define who we are. They may be part of who we are, but they are not our identity. They are not where we find our purpose. \nIn Daniel, we see a man walking with God in the midst of exile. Yes, it is possible! There is grace and hope, even in exile. Exile is not the end of the story. \nIn this book, we see God taking a remnant of His people and sending them into exile. Yet, as Daniel unfolds, we also see they have a purpose in being there, that God is still at work even in the midst of their struggle and threatening circumstances. \nThrough the book of Daniel, we observe the battle of the heart as well as God’s provision and protection in the midst of that battle. We learn that when God’s people turn their hearts towards Him, He provides for them, even in exile. I may long to be faithful, yet there is hope when I am not. \nThere is a lot of detail in today’s reading, a lot of talk about who did what and who didn’t.

Daniel, a young prophet from Judah, is taken from everything familiar. He is lifted out of a culture in which he is part of the majority and becomes a minority living in a foreign land with foreign gods. Many of us reading this today can relate. \nThe setting of Daniel is the powerful kingdom of Babylon around 605 BC. The kingdom of Judah, the last half of now-divided Israel, has fallen away from God yet again and is taken captive by King Nebuchadnezzar and moved to the kingdom of Babylonia. \nIn the first half of the book, we see Daniel walk through these difficult circumstances, all the while pointing to the Everlasting Kingdom of the one true God. In the second half of the book, we see Daniel share the dreams God gives him, dreams that also point to that Everlasting Kingdom.\nIn its dramatically compelling narrative and fascinating prophecy, the book of Daniel illustrates one consistent theme: “God’s dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom is from generation to generation.” (Daniel 4:34b)\nOur circumstances change and earthly rulers come and go, but God’s is the Everlasting Kingdom.  \nwritten by Britton Sharp\n\n                ",

In this short sentence, he expresses both the purpose and predicament of the human condition. We are made for rest in God, but we look for rest in all the wrong places.\nAugustine knew this struggle firsthand. For he, like you and me, had a drifter’s heart. But that’s not just true for Augustine or you or me. It’s true for everyone. This is why reading the history of Israel often feels a bit like a day in the life of a parent with a two year old. No matter how many times God tells Israel not to do something, they still wind up sticking screwdrivers into electrical sockets (spiritually speaking). \nYou might half expect the last chapter of this book to be God’s “I’ve had it up to here with you” speech. But nothing could be further from the truth. Instead, Hosea chapter 14 is God’s “I love you this much” speech. Complete with beautiful promises of healing kindness, turned-away anger, and unconditional love, God calls adulterating Israel back to the arms of His covenant affection to experience the restoration of life, joy, and peace.\nIsn’t it amazing that this chapter begins with the word “return to the Lord” and not “go away; I’m through with you”? After all we’ve done, God’s love remains. More than anything, He wants us to be restored to Him, and so He pleads for us to return in repentance and then He patiently waits and watches. \nThe daily practice of returning to God for the love and grace He freely gives is the heart of the Christian life.

It reminds me of the book of Hosea. \nOne of the biggest problems the protagonist Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon, has is memory loss. He wakes up, suddenly a guy who can’t remember his name, where he lives, or where he works. He doesn’t even know how he got to where he is. His problem, the inability to remember, is what Hosea 13 is about. Just like with Jason Bourne, God’s people keep forgetting who they are, where they are, and how they got there. \nIn today’s reading, the prophet Hosea recounts to Israel how God remembered them in the desert, what He did to set them free, and how He forgave them in their rebellious idolatry. Forgetfulness leading to idolatry is what happened to them while they were in the desert. Though God had remembered Israel, they forgot Him, His rescue, and His promise. \nIsrael had been in bondage as slaves to Egypt’s cruel Pharaoh for hundreds of years. They labored day and night, building Pharaoh’s breathtaking city, with no hope of freedom. Their enslavement is a sad but rich picture of the evil “pharaoh” we call sin. Sin makes us work as hard as we can, promising us glory from the fruit of our hands. But it never delivers. Obedience to the commands of sin keeps us in bondage.\nUltimately, it took the death of the firstborn sons of Egypt to break Pharaoh’s hardened heart and convince him to finally set Israel free. This sacrifice points to the death of Jesus, the firstborn over all creation (Colossians 1:15), who died so that men and women who are dead in sin can be freed from their cruel taskmaster and raised to new life.\nHosea reminds us that, just as fast as Israel praised God for His deliverance, they forgot Him. They forgot His character, love, faithfulness, and goodness, and their forgetfulness led them to idolatry. They exchanged trust in God’s faithfulness for belief in lie that He was unfaithful to them. We are tempted to make the same exchange. \nForget not God and His goodness. When we forget our God, we begin to worship powerless idols like the golden calf. In our day it looks more like money, lust, control, success, power, and comfort. The list is endless, but the result is the same. The only thing these impotent idols guarantee us is emptiness – splinters of their broken promises.\nDon’t forget. Remember God’s provision: Jesus, the manna of God. He sustains us in the barren wilderness of our lives. Remember Jesus’ work. Remember your faithful Friend.\nWritten By Jevon Washington\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In 1517, Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany. This, in turn, set the Reformation in motion. In the first of these theses, Luther boldly asserted, “When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, ‘Repent’ (Mt 4:17), He willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance.” We find this to be the consistent teaching of the Scriptures—both in the Old and New Testaments. In the prophetic ministry of Hosea, God calls His people to turn from their sin and back to Him again and again.\nThe Covenant Lord—having brought unfaithful Israel before His tribunal in order to pronounce His indictment against them (Hosea 12:1-2)—now does something unexpected. Instead of simply pouring out that judgment, He reminds them of their inception by His grace and of the way in which He brought their father, Jacob, to repentance by grace. \nIn bringing the story of Jacob to bear on the current condition of Israel, the Lord encourages them to respond as their father Jacob had done at Bethel. Though a deceiver from birth, Jacob “strove with the Angel and prevailed; he wept and sought His favor. He met God at Bethel” (v. 4). \nReturning to the Lord involves striving for the covenant blessing—weeping over our sin and longing for the spiritual blessings of God in Christ. Of course, all of this also means that we recognize that it is God who takes the initiative. \nMoving from the story of Jacob to the story of the Exodus, the Lord next reminds Israel that He is the Covenant Lord who sovereignly took them “from the land of Egypt.” He promised that He would “again make them dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed feast” (v. 9). Returning and restoration are ultimately the work of God’s free grace. God is the great grace initiator. He is the one who provides the redemption that enables His people to repent and turn back to Him.\nNext, the Lord reminded Israel of the central role that His Word plays in bringing His people to repentance. He says, “I spoke to the prophets; it was I who multiplied visions, and through the prophets gave parables” (v. 10). The Word of God is the central means by which Jacob returned to the Lord. Hosea reminds Israel that it was at Bethel (the place where Jacob wrestled with God) that “God spoke with us” (v. 4). The same thing was true at the Exodus: “By a prophet the Lord brought Israel up from Egypt, and by a prophet he was guarded” (v. 10). So, too, for us.\nGod still calls rebellious sinners back to Himself by virtue of His initiating grace and by means of His Word. Just as Luther reminded us that the entirety of the believer’s life is one of repentance, so we are reminded as we read through Hosea of who that repentance comes from and by what means it comes to us.\nWritten By Nick Batzig \n\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Growing up in North Texas, tornadoes were common. Every spring, news channels would routinely interrupt our regularly scheduled program to update us on the latest tornadic activity. We’d watch with fear, wondering if the tornado was going to make its way through our part of the state.\nSometimes the tornado came eerily close. We would hide in closets or lie in the bath tub under a mattress, hoping to protect ourselves if it took our roof off. We felt like Isaiah: “We are men of unclean lips! We’re not worthy!”\nWeather like that is fierce and unrelenting. You can’t hug a tornado into submission. It’s like an angry god, hurling its wrath toward anything in its path. It destroys a town and moves on to the next with no compassion or remorse. Honestly, I’m kind of surprised we never left a burnt offering on the doorstep to try and appease the gods of weather. Our fear was a type of worship.\nIn Hosea 11, we continue to see the interesting relationship between God and His people. Israel has been unfaithful. They don’t want God’s steadfast love. Like Gomer, they are a bride who chases after other men. They have a perfect, loving Husband at home, but to them, He’s not good enough. In this passage, there is yet another glimmer of hope because of God’s love.\nPerhaps the most powerful phrase here is in verse 9: “For I am God and not man, the Holy One among you; I will not come in rage.” The good news for God’s people, and all sinful people, is that God is not like us.\nWe seek revenge; God seeks justice. We are spiteful; God is merciful. We are unforgiving; God is über-forgiving. We are adulterers; God is faithful. We are hateful; God is love.\nGod is not like us, but He does come near to us. He is wrathful toward sin, but He doesn’t leave us in His wrath. As He has shown time and again in the book of Hosea and throughout the rest of Scripture, He draws us in rather than forcing us out.\nGod is not an uncontrollable, mindless tornado. He is not seeking to tear the roof off our house, destroy our belongings, and leave us destitute. Though our spiritual houses may collapse, and they almost assuredly will at some point, He will not leave us homeless. He doesn’t leave destruction in His wake and move on to the next town.\nThrough Jesus, God has brought us near. Through the Holy Spirit, God has made us not just His house, but His temple. He lives inside of us. He propels us toward loving and following Him. Though we cheat, He takes us back.\nWritten By Brandon D. Smith \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    There’s an old Seinfeld episode where George tries to convince his in-laws that he has a place in the Hamptons. Not believing him, they ask him to show it to them. Knowing they are trying to call his bluff, George nevertheless loads them into his car and drives them two hours away to the Hamptons just because he resents the idea of being called out. The drive is a contest of wills—a test to see who will break first. The problem is that George cannot win because his in-laws see right through him.\nIn Hosea 10, God sees right through Israel’s pretending. They make promises, but they don’t mean them. They offer sacrifices, but don’t connect their own hearts to them. They are in the process of cutting themselves off from God. They’re working so hard to hold it all together, but they’ve reached a point where everything they’re doing now is just for show. They know it. God knows it. But the pretending goes on. It is like a game of chicken, and Israel is convinced they will be the last to swerve.\nBut they’re exhausted. Are you exhausted by the effort you put into your shows of strength and self-sufficiency? I get bone tired when I’m putting up a front.\nGod gives us beautiful prayers in Scripture—words to turn to when we’re weary of pretending to be something we’re not:\nTurn to me and be gracious to me,\nfor I am alone and afflicted.\nThe distresses of my heart increase;\nbring me out of my sufferings.\nConsider my affliction and trouble,\nand take away all my sins.\n– Psalm 25:16-18\nOr, simply, Jesus calling to us:\n“Come to Me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.”\n– Matthew 11:28\nBut if you’re like me, in our pride, we often refuse to be the first to relent. We just press on toward that image we’re trying to pass off as real.\nBut here’s the thing about God: He delights to take us to the end of ourselves. He will often let us drive Him all the way out to the Hamptons if that’s what we’re bent on doing, knowing we have nothing of substance to show Him there.\nWhy does He do this? Because God, out of love, uses our own stubbornness and futile efforts to discipline us. He brings us to the end of ourselves, and there we find Him ready to take us back. \nAs we grow, may it take us fewer miles of pretending to embrace that truth.\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

I’m not talking about adventure seeking or site seeing, but true wilderness wandering. You’re stuck in the desert and can’t find your way out. No way home. Wandering.\nThere is some truth in the oft quoted Tolkienism, “Not all who wander are lost.” But in today’s text, Hosea isn’t talking about the kind of whimsical “off to find yourself” sort of wandering. What Hosea is describing to the Israelites is a hopeless sort of wandering, a diaspora. He’s predicting more of an Israelite refugee crisis than a couple weeks backpacking the Appalachian trail. \nWhy such harsh words? Didn’t God still love His people? YES! But the weight of their sin and the consequences of their actions were serious. \nSometimes we, too, need to pause and have a similar moment of startling revelation. You see, we have the benefit of being able to read this passage with the end of Hosea in mind (and with the Gospels in mind, for that matter!). Chapter 14 describes an opportunity for the people of God to repent and embrace blessing, but it is a difficult time. We know God loves His people and pursues His people, but Hosea shows us that His people need prophetic—and sometimes painful—moments to face the truth.\nSometimes we have to face the depths of our sin to know what exactly it is we are being saved from. If we were to jump straight from transgression to restoration, we might not ever break out of a perpetual cycle of the same sins.\nTrue restoration comes in the wake of repentance—a repentance that understands the wrong committed, but also recognizes what hangs in the balance. The love of God, shown through the cross and resurrection of Christ, is never far from us. But the cross allows us to see the weight of our sin. Only then can we recognize that we can’t lift it.\nGod, in His love and wisdom, works toward our redemption through our repeated failures. This was the story of the nation of Israel: right relationship with God, followed by spiritual drift, followed by intentional rebellious sin, followed by prophetic truth-telling, followed by repentance, followed by restoration, and repeat cycle. In many ways, this mirrors each of our individual spiritual journeys. \nWhile God’s restoring grace is a mystery to us in certain respects, there are a few things we can be sure of: 1) A healthy fear of God is never a bad thing; 2) understanding the weight of sin is painful and scary, but necessary; and 3) God, in His all-knowing and all-embracing love, is with us every step of the way, even if we don’t feel His presence. \nWritten By Andrew Stoddard \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I’m a child of divorce. As a young teenager, my mom left my dad for another man after a year-long affair. One day while my dad was at work, we packed up and moved in with her new boyfriend.\nAt the time, it seemed like a good thing. My dad was working tons of hours and had become irritable. My mom’s boyfriend was a “cool” guy, who acted more like my friend than a father figure. I was an immature, naïve kid—I thought my immediate happiness was more important than my parents’ marriage. I was just glad to have a new friend.\nLong story short, he became abusive toward my mom. He was not a “cool” guy; he was manipulative. He destroyed my parents’ marriage and began to destroy our lives. It turns out that the destruction of marriages is not really good for anyone.\nHosea experienced similar heartache. Gomer was a serial cheater. She denied his covenantal love to chase fleeting happiness. She was more interested in the supposed greener grass that was found somewhere else. She didn’t appreciate or realize what she had at home.\nOf course, the story of Hosea and Gomer is the story of God and His people. Israel was no different than we are today. God still says of His people, “They have installed kings, but not through Me. They have appointed leaders, but without My approval. They make their silver and gold into idols for themselves for their own destruction” (Hosea 8:4). Like Adam and Eve in the Garden, we trade the unending joy of giving our lives to God for the quick taste of a rotting apple.\nThroughout the book of Hosea, we see both the loving-kindness and frustration of God with His people. Like Gomer, they refuse His repeated attempts at reconciliation and continue to ignore His love. Divorce is their only true desire.\nBut God told Hosea to stay. In today’s reading, God promises to “remember their guilt and punish their sins” (Hosea 8:13). They pay for their sins, of course. However, though breaking a covenant is painful and destructive, it doesn’t have to be the end.\nAs we see, God didn’t leave Israel to keep chasing that desire. He didn’t sign the divorce papers. He didn’t send His people packing—at least not entirely and not forever. Jesus echoes God’s love for Israel in Matthew 23:37: “Jerusalem, Jerusalem! She who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her. How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, yet you were not willing!”\nIn Jesus, God keeps His promise to both punish us and redeem us. Sin is punished ultimately through Jesus, not God’s people. He’s doesn’t tell Hosea to do something He Himself isn’t willing to do. He stays. He fights for His adulterous bride. God’s faithfulness is embodied in Jesus’ life, ministry, death, resurrection, ascension, and second coming. The Father’s sending of the Son is the definition of grace: unmerited, undeserved, logic-shattering favor.\nMy parents weren’t able to reconcile. They’re still divorced. But not every story ends that way. Because God’s grace is stronger than any earthly feeling, our story ends the way it should—with a wedding feast and an eternal relationship with the Lover of our souls (Rev. 19-22).\nWritten By Brandon D. Smith \n \n\n                ",

It seems they have two primary ways of exhibiting these latter qualities: 1. disobeying in the same ways repeatedly, no matter what parents say, or 2. thinking they can find a new way to get around rules. And, of course, both lead to the same results each time without fail. Parents’ rules don’t change, don’t bend, and don’t have loopholes. So each exhibition of thick-headedness is met with consequences. The only way this changes is if the kids begin to learn to obey and submit to their parents’ wishes.\nIn Hosea 7, Israel is the thick-headed child. Verse after verse regales the reader with the rebellion of one tribe or another. They are stubborn; they think they are clever. They are trying to put one past God or overrun His authority with sheer will – like that ever works. It’s what got them into trouble in the first place.\nEven more remarkable is that this comes on the heels of redemption upon redemption. Throughout the first part of the book of Hosea, we saw God go to great lengths to show His people how He would rescue them from themselves and their unfaithfulness. And yet, here we are. You and I should resonate with this. We should recognize our own proclivity to rebel, to ignore, to think too highly of our cleverness. We are like Israel in a million ways.\nBut Israel’s, and our, fickleness and foolishness does not change God. He shows Himself to be a Redeemer still. He says, “I want to redeem them.” Despite rebellion upon disrespect upon idolatry, God wants to redeem His people—even though they do not call on Him. They grasp at any other false hope they can find. They use the gifts and abilities God gave them for their own ends instead of for His honor. They reject God completely. Yet still He wants to redeem.\nGod does not change. He does not waffle when we waffle. God does not become distant and unavailable when we distance ourselves. He is steady though we are not. He is faithful though we are not. Though we push God away, He does not push us away. \nGod stands ready to redeem, and make whole, and restore. Always. Even when we behave like stubborn children.\nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

What, then, are we to make of this declaration: “Come, let us return to the Lord” (Hosea 6:1)?\nIs this an expression of genuine repentance, or another vain commitment, a faithless promise?\nEven well-intentioned repentance, if performed in our own strength, will be like the dew that goes early away. Time and again, Ephraim and Judah had vowed and fallen away. They had promised and grown weary of keeping their promise. “What shall I do with you, O Ephraim?” God asks (v. 4). \nLike Ephraim, when I hear that question, my gut reaction is to say to God, “Give me another chance! I can do it this time!” But I cannot. God does not desire my own sacrificial efforts, or any vain attempt on my part to earn His favor. Such pursuits are not repentance. \nYet how often do I substitute “sacrifice” for faithful love? Do I measure my spiritual walk by the fruit that I bear, rather than by what He has done? Do I walk alone, rather than in the light of His fellowship and the communion of the saints? Do I engage in the Word and prayer as to-dos, rather than as feast of grace? When I sin, do I try to earn my way back into God’s favor, rather than leaning wholly upon Christ?\nWe all have Ephraim hearts. We are quick to turn aside and to seek refreshment from strange waters (Jer. 2:17-25). But God, in His great mercy, has offered deliverance even to us. God’s rebukes mercifully drive us to Christ: \n“He has struck us down, and He will bind us up.\nAfter two days He will revive us;\non the third day He will raise us up,\nthat we may live before Him.”\n– Hosea 6:1-2\nOur hope of return to the Lord is not in our efforts, but in Christ. In Him we are struck down, as God visited His just wrath against our sin on the cross. In Him are we raised on the third day. God does not desire vain sacrifice from us, for Christ Jesus, the true sacrifice, has already satisfied the demands of justice. \nTherefore, let us know; “let us press on to know the Lord” (Hosea 6:3). He has come to us as the spring rain, making even the wasteland and desert glad (Isaiah 35:1). Let us lay aside vain pursuits and walk in His steadfast love.

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    A few years ago, a public high school English teacher in our town had all of the junior class read Jonathan Edwards’ famous sermon, “Sinners in the Hand of an Angry God.” The teacher told his students that he had assigned it to them in order to stir up distaste for puritanical theology and preaching. After all, among the countless unpopular subjects someone could bring up, the judgment of God has got to take first place.\nThe teacher then proceeded to tell the class that Edwards was simply trying to scare men and women into a certain form of ethical behavior. Academics have often used this sermon for similar pejorative purposes. However, it must be noted that the content and purpose of this sermon, which God singularly used to bring about the Great Awakening, has often been misrepresented. As he brought this sermon to an end, Edwards, in no uncertain terms, held forth the hope of the mercy and grace of God to those who would come to Christ when he said:\n“Now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has thrown the door of mercy wide open, and stands in calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners; a day wherein many are flocking to Him, and pressing into the kingdom of God. Many are daily coming from the east, west, north, and south; many that were very lately in the same miserable condition that you are in, are now in a happy state, with their hearts filled with love to Him who has loved them, and washed them from their sins in His own blood, and rejoicing in hope of the glory of God.”\nThe judgment of God is a subject of supreme importance, both for our understanding of who God is and for our understanding of who we are. It is necessary that we come to come to terms with the reality of the righteous judgment of God if we are ever going to understand the nature of His saving work in Christ.\nHere in Hosea 5—as the Covenant Lord brings further indictment against Israel for her spiritual adultery—He now sets before His people, in highly symbolic language, the judgment that they deserve for their idolatrous rejection of Him. Hosea explains that God’s judgment will be poured out like water and that He was promising to come as a destroying “moth” and as “dry rot” (vv. 10, 12). Additionally, the Covenant Lord speaks of His coming in judgment as a lion, “tearing them to pieces” (v. 14). These figures are meant to stir up an understanding of what the people should expect from the Lord.\nHowever, mingled in the midst of the promise of impending judgment is a note of hope. At the end of the charge that the Lord brings against the whole nation, He says, “I will return again to My place, until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face, and in their distress earnestly seek Me” (Hosea 5:15).\nHere the hope of mercy is held out for those who would turn from their idols and to the Lord. The same God who promises to come in judgment, offers the hope of mercy and grace. All of this, of course, is based on the fact that the Lord would take the judgment on Himself in the person of Jesus. \nWhen Christ came, the wrath of God was poured out on Him like water.\nWritten By Nick Batzig \n\n                ",

But I’m going to risk it.\nWhen I read books, I sometimes move quickly through difficult passages.

Or to skip over the chapter altogether. After all, the author uses the word “whore,” or a variant of it, about a dozen times. It can either distract you or cause you to move along quickly without hearing the full weight of what God is saying to Israel.\nThese are God’s people. And yet, the picture of their falling away from the worship and character expected of them is so dark and twisted, it’s hard to read. We all love the redemptive story of Hosea, but man, chapter four is dark.\nBut really, without chapter four, there is no great redemptive love. If we skip over all the ugliness of the story, we miss out on all the beauty of God’s pursuit of His people. Top to bottom, God’s people were mired in sin that seems almost unimaginable. Even the priests were in on the action. They seem to have rejected God altogether and were acting just like pagans.\nThink about it. If they had only been mildly rebellious, this story of God’s redemptive pursuit of them would have been less than it is. What if they just had an issue with greed and that was it? What if they were sexually chaste and went to church like they were supposed to and were otherwise nice people? Would they still need to be saved from their sin? Sure. But through the story of Hosea, God wanted the glory of His grace to be clear. He wanted it to be something we would stand up and gawk at.\nSo maybe we should slow down when reading chapter four. Maybe we should read it slow enough to catch all the shadows of our need for redemption. Maybe we need to read it carefully enough to see the beauty of God’s redemptive pursuit through Jesus’ blood on the cross. Those are the sins He died to save us from. Read them slowly and then quickly, and remember that they no longer separate us from God.\nWritten By Matthew B. Redmond\n \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    We love heroes. The hero of a story is the one we want to resonate with and be like. If you grew up attending Sunday school like I did, that’s often how you come to Bible stories: Who is the hero I should emulate? And certainly there are some heroes in Scripture, or at least heroic moments. There is courage and faithfulness and self-sacrifice.\nIn Hosea 3 we see an act of bold, selfless, forgiving love. Hosea goes to redeem his unfaithful wife for a price, to buy her out of prostitution. Wow. He took her back and paid a price for her, despite her repeated brazen unfaithfulness.\nBut if we are looking for a character with whom to relate in this story, it is not Hosea. It is his wife, the adulteress. We are not the redeemer; we are the unfaithful ones in need of redemption. \nIf that seems harsh or crass, it simply means we lack context. Throughout the Old Testament, God iterates and reiterates His covenant of faithfulness to His people, like a marriage covenant. He affirms that He will be faithful to them (us)—He will be their God and they will be His people. Yet, time and again, the people break that covenant; they cheat on Him. They are unfaithful by seeking out other gods or seeking to be their own gods. And we are just the same.\nThe hero of this story is God the Redeemer, the One who purchased His unfaithful bride out of the bondage they (we) chose. But this is no rom-com story of unrequited love turned to affection in a twenty-minute montage. In this story, God’s people must wait for restoration. Wholeness after brokenness doesn’t happen all at once, or even in a short time.\nFor Israel, God was promising the coming of Christ after a long wait. He would free them from exile, but their restoration would come only after a long wait. And what He asks of them is faithfulness—to cling to Him and no other. And that is the command for us as well. \nOur wait after redemption is for sanctification, to be made holy. This does not happen all at once but rather by grace, through faith, over time—until the day comes when God’s people are made perfect in His presence.\nHere and now, we must look to our Redeemer, the One who paid a price for our unfaithful selves, and be faithful to Him. This is our call. We are called to be faithful to Him alone while we wait for the restoration that will make us whole and free in God’s goodness. \nWe are the rescued, and He is the hero.\nWritten By Barnabas Piper \n\n                ",

Without the presence and love of God, it’s nearly impossible for a marriage that has suffered such a blow to become whole and healthy once again.\nSo much more than physical intimacy is severed through unfaithfulness. Emotional connectedness, relational trust, spiritual oneness—all of these are fractured through adultery.\nIt’s easy to read portions of Hosea and have a sense of indignation towards his wayward wife. But the reality is, spiritually speaking, we have all walked in the steps of Hosea’s prostitute wife more than once.\nHosea’s life was meant to be an extended illustration to the people of Israel, indicting them for their serial unfaithfulness to God. Despite the goodness God had shown them, in spite of the redemption and release from slavery He had given them, regardless of His continuous provision, the people of Israel perpetually found themselves worshiping false gods. Most prominently in Hosea, we see that the Israelites turned their affections towards Baal, a pagan god of fertility.\nGod’s relentless pursuit of His people was visualized in the life of Hosea. Hosea offered unconditional love and forgiveness to his wandering wife. Though she had countless lovers, Hosea always welcomed her home with loving arms wide open.\nHosea would speak to her, “You are my wife. You are loved. Come home.”\nGod spoke to the Israelites, “You who do not deserve to be my people, you are my people. Come home. You are loved.”\nGod speaks to you now: “You who have sought other lovers and encounters with false gods, through other people, places, and possessions – you are my bride. Come home. You are loved.”\nWe know from Paul’s letters that we are the Bride of Christ. Yet we also know from experience that we are far from being a faithful one. Only the supernatural love of God can cover and forgive such blatant and constant transgressions.\nThe product of our sin, the result of our wayward choosing, is that we end up in the camp of “not my people.” We wander away from our spiritual home in search of passions and pleasures that we think will fill the void. Yet what you need, what I need, what we all need most is to turn to God. \nHe will always call us back and always rename us, “his people.” \nWritten By Andrew Stoddard \n\n                ",

But that friend sent me a photocopied chapter from a book that was soon to be released. The pages came with very little commentary other than “dude, read this.” So I did, sitting on a sun-warmed boulder in the middle of a swollen river in Arkansas. And to this day I cannot read these verses from Hosea without thinking of the phrase Brent Curtis used to title those pages – “less-wild lovers.”\nThat chapter from The Sacred Romance talked of the many “lovers” we chase after in our lives, the addictions we flirt with and often allow to take root in our hearts. These addictions can range from alcohol to bible studies to exercise and everything in between. We’re convinced the promises these lovers make will fill the ache in our bones, and often they do for a season. But only for a season. Then we’re faced with the choice: double up and try harder, or search out for some new same-but-different thrill, or slowly resign ourselves to what Thoreau called the life of quiet desperation.\nAll the while the wildest of lovers waits. But God’s is not some impotent waiting. It is jealous.\n“I will expose her lewdness.”\n“I will ruin her vines.”\n“I will punish her for the days she burned incense to the Baals.”\nNot the kind of let’s-make-sure-everybody-feels-good-because-love-wins spirituality that’s so viral these days, is it? No, not by a long shot. But if we’re going to read Scripture in its fullness, then this is part of the picture of God’s love.\nYou don’t need a theology degree to understand the force behind these verses. It’s humblingly clear: “she…went after her lovers, but me she forgot” (Hosea 2:13). To chase other lovers is simply to forget God, the God who set aside His glory and wrapped Himself in flesh so that you and I might be called the sons and daughters of God. If you’ve ever loved someone with all you have and then that person left you for greener pastures, so to speak, then you know the feeling of being forgotten. It is the feeling of a broken heart.\nWhile we chase the less-wild lovers, the wildest One waits. But these verses won’t allow us the excuse of “I didn’t know.” We do. Scripture is clear. God’s is not some impotent waiting. He is jealous. Jealous for our full affection.\nWritten By John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Hebrews 10:31 tells us “it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.”\nA number of years ago, a friend of mine got arrested for doing something bad in public—bad enough to make the evening news. That’s how we learned about his offense—by watching him get loaded into the back of a police car on tv.\nOne person in our friend group said, “Wouldn’t it be strangely freeing if everyone knew our most secret sins – if when we walked into a room, everyone knew the truth about us? Wouldn’t there be some good in it if people knew the things we work so hard to hide?”\nIn a manner of speaking, the book of Hosea opens with the people of Israel in cuffs, getting loaded into the back of the squad car. It happens like this: God tells His prophet to Hosea to “take to yourself a wife of whoredom and have children of whoredom, for the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the Lord” (Hosea 1:2 ESV).\nHosea’s life was to be a sort of performance art. His marriage, along with all the pain it would bring him, was meant to stand as a witness against the people to whom he had been sent to proclaim God’s call to repentance. Good things—great things, in fact—lay in store for God’s people; but first they needed to be busted for who they really were: unfaithful people, raising a new generation in their infidelity.\nThere is no greater love than to lay down your life for your friends (John 15:13), but Hosea is a hard book. When you start to imagine the circumstances that would have moved God to ask His prophet to offer up his own heart for the sake of a nation of betrayers, it gets dark quickly. Think of the nights Hosea spent alone, knowing what his wife was up to. Hosea loved Gomer. He really did. But he knew she would break his heart over and over again. Unless Gomer herself felt the pain of her infidelity, she would never repent. But for this to happen, she would have to own the truth about who she was.\nThe same is true for us. Hosea’s marriage told Israel they were living like prostitutes while in a marriage covenant with God Himself. Hosea’s marriage, along with his genuine love for and sorrow over Gomer, was meant to arrest Israel (and us) in their (and our) acts of infidelity and read to them their (and our) rights. \nBecause of Jesus, we have the right to know God and to live at peace with Him. But as long as we deny our crimes—our perpetual running after other lovers—we will never accept the means by which we find the peace our hearts long for. Unless we are apprehended and exposed for what we are, we will never understand the steadfast love and mercy of our Groom—Jesus Christ, who took us as His own and binds our wandering hearts to Him.\nIt is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. But how else will we be set free?\nWritten By Russ Ramsey \n\n                ",

It seems I knew more about parenting then than I do now, after fourteen years of fatherhood.\nA few months ago we had one of those parenting days. It was Sunday, and our kids had been terrible all day. They were terrible before church. They were terrible on the way to the church. They were terrible at church. They were also terrible on the way home from church, and then terrible at lunch. Had we gone to the pool that afternoon, they would’ve been terrible there, too. \nWe could not figure out what was going on, but I was losing it. By that evening I’d had it. The smallest infraction that might have been overlooked on any other day, now had the effect of a nuclear bomb. And there were bombs going off all over our house at bedtime. Then I truly lost it. I yelled and hollered in a way I never had before, and it made my kids cry as they lay in their beds.\nI felt awful.\nBy the time all my self-righteous indignation had worn down, they were asleep and I was left in despair. I kept trying to justify my anger but I couldn’t, and then I just felt terrible again. The idea of waking them up and apologizing for my sinful anger kept running through my head. But I could not do it.\nMaybe you haven’t done this as a parent, but maybe you have as a husband or friend. You said or did something unkind to someone, then the day was done and you were left wide awake to feel the weight of the guilt of it. It’s a pretty dark place. It’s hard enough to face your sin, but to know that your sin has truly hurt someone else is just downright painful.\nIt’s a dark place, and the need for light is real.\nIn the midst of delivering God’s prophecy against Israel, Micah gets very personal. He confesses his own sin. Then he says that God will be a light to him in a dark place (Micah 7:8), and that God will plead his cause and vindicate him (v. 9). In other words, Micah turned toward God in humble repentance, knowing that God would be there for him, gracious and forgiving.\nIt took me awhile to get there, but that is where I ended up: humbled. Instead of wallowing in my guilt all night, I went to God and repented. The gospel was the light I needed in that dark place, knowing that Jesus has already pleaded my cause with His blood, and I am already vindicated because of His completed work on the cross—not because of my own works.\nI still looked forward to apologizing to my kids the next morning. But when I went to bed that night, I went in the full security of the gospel, which is good news for sinners.\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

Without a doubt, it is true that “God is love,” as John reminds us in his letters (I John 4:8). But when we skip over the justice and righteousness of God, we lose a sense of the very real, very tough truth: that God is just, righteous, and holy, and that in our sin, His people have fallen short throughout the ages (Romans 3:23).\nGod’s prophet, Micah, tells us, “It is wise to fear [God’s] name” (Micah 6:9). Fear seems like such an odd word to describe a part of our relationship with God. But throughout the prophets’ writing, and especially in the book of Proverbs, we read over and over again of how important it is to have a healthy fear of God. Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived, encourages us: “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding” (Proverbs 9:10). \nCertainly, Solomon was well aware of the beauty and wonder of God’s unmerited grace and goodness—the same God who poured out favor and lavished wisdom upon Solomon, though Solomon would ultimately stray far from God’s direction. When we neglect to fear the Lord and follow His commands and His ways, we place ourselves in a position that is at odds with His holiness.\nWhile legal proceedings worked a little differently in the ancient Near East, it’s not difficult to grasp the gravity of the circumstances in Micah 6. Being in a metaphorical courtroom on the opposite side of the table from God is not a good situation to be in.\nThis is not because we serve and worship a vindictive or vengeful God, but rather because we serve a just, holy, and righteous God. Yes, His goodness, mercy, and love have covered the sins of those who call on Jesus’ name. But Micah reminds us of the very real consequences of our sinful choices: they always put distance between us and God, between us and our family and friends.\nWhat God required of His people in Micah is still required of us: “to act justly, to love faithfulness, and to walk humbly with [our] God” (Micah 6:8). While we often have trouble living, thinking, and speaking consistently in this way, we are blessed beyond belief to have a great High Priest and Advocate, who stands with us and for us when we break God’s law.\nWe are wise to fear God in His greatness and power, and we are wise to draw near to God because He promises He will always draw near to us. When we do, He provides the power and mercy we need to pursue our calling and love Him in the midst of our trials and challenges.  \nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

Every year the same rich, familiar texts were read, and the same songs were sung. The same feeling of sleepy hopefulness and joy would waft through the sanctuary, or so it seemed to me. It was a simple tradition with strong roots, not least of all because it was laced with prophecies and promises of the coming King.\nIt was in these services that I first heard (maybe the only time I heard) the sentence “Bethlehem Ephrathah… one will come from you to be ruler over Israel” (Micah 5:2). It was a Christmas promise, a candlelight lesson to precede a carol, and it was so much more. These words are a Christmas promise for all time, a promise of a coming eternal King who will conquer enemies and rule to the ends of the earth forever. He is a King who will bring peace.\nWhat exactly does “peace” mean? It means all false gods and idols will be removed; no more will people worship the work of their hands, whether an accomplishment or a physical product. It means God’s people will be shepherded, cared for, protected, and directed. It means God’s people will not be run down or defeated by enemies any longer. The poor will be lifted up and oppressors thrown down. And all this will have no end, either in time or in place; it will be eternal and cover every inch of the earth.\nThis is a Christmas promise: the line of Judah will continue, and the King will sit on the throne of David as God’s chosen One. We know this to be Jesus. But this is not a Christmas promise contained in lessons and carols. It is not a soft glow and gentle melody. And it is not bound to two days in December.\nThis promise roars through all time. The King is coming, the Son of the Most High. We celebrate Jesus’ humble beginnings on Christmas, but we should also rest in the promise of His peace every day. We sing of His birth in December, but we should live under His reign, always. We remember when our King came to earth the first time, and we should look forward eagerly to His return. For His kingdom will have no end. In that promise we have peace, and when He returns we will have perfect peace. \nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of living in the Blue Ridge Mountains, hiking the Sangre de Christo Mountains, traveling through the German Alps, skiing the French Alps and the Rockies, and flying around the seemingly endless Alaskan Mountain ranges. There is something mystical and majestic about these natural structures that tower over the rest of creation. In addition to their natural majesty, Scripture actually has quite a lot to say about the theological significance of mountains.\nThe garden of Eden sat on the top of a mountain (Ezekiel 28:14-16). This is why God later appeared to Moses at the top of Sinai and Elijah at Horeb. It also explains why He ordained that both the King’s house and the temple would be built high on top of a mountain of Jerusalem. Mountains capture something of the transcendence and exaltation of the Most High God. It should, then, come as no surprise to us that when the prophet Micah speaks of the gospel age and blessings, he does so by way of drawing off of the illustration of a mountain.\nIn order to pave the way for spiritual mountain imagery, the Lord first has Micah prophesy of the judgment the nation deserves on account of their corrupt religious leaders. Having laid bare the many injustices of His prophets and priests (Micah 3:5-11)—the fact that they hated good and loved evil (Micah 3:2)—the Lord promised to plow Zion as a field and leave Jerusalem “a heap of ruins” (Micah 3:12). They would be like a pile of discarded wood. God promised He would level Israel to the ground for all of the greed, idolatry, and falsehood of their religious leaders.\nAgainst this background, Micah then prophesied of the forthcoming gospel blessings, when “the mountain of the Lord’s house will be established at the top of the mountains and will be raised above the hills” (Micah 4:1). Then the peoples and nations will come to the heavenly Zion to hear the Word of God and to worship the living God in truth. \nThe writer of Hebrews picks up on this and explains that the mountain of mountains is Mount Zion—”the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem” where we come to “an innumerable company of angels… the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are registered in heaven… God the Judge of all… the spirits of just men made perfect… Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant” (Hebrews 12:22-24). It is there that we “will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever” (Micah 4:5). \nMountains are glorious on their own. But to walk on the mountain of the Lord with the Lord will be a glory like no other. This is a glory in which all who call on the name of Christ are destined to walk.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

All was well until the rig exploded, killing eleven workers and causing one of the greatest environmental catastrophes in the history of the world.\nThe explosion on the Deepwater Horizon may have been a surprise to most of the workers on the rig that day, but it wasn’t a surprise to one person. Earlier that morning, rig operator Jimmy Harrell had argued with a senior BP official about what materials should be used to fix a leaky pipe. Harrell suggested a proven, yet expensive, option. However, the BP executive chose the cheaper, unproven, less reliable option. Tragedy, of course, followed, with oil washing up on the shores of the mainland for years to come. \nIn the first chapter of today’s reading, God speaks through His prophet Micah to warn the people of His imminent judgment. God cannot turn a blind eye toward the sins of His people simply because they are His. Israel’s world is literally going to be torn apart, and God is being intentional with His people, informing them of the judgment due to them because of their disobedience. Micah warns them, “All this will happen because of Jacob’s rebellion and the sins of the house of Israel” (Micah 1:5). God’s people are not going to be pillaged because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, or because of the greed of surrounding nations. No, God wants His people to know that their immanent destruction is of their own doing and because of their own sin. Still, His warning goes unheeded.\nBut in chapter 2, God offers a ray of hope amidst the lament and despair. He says through Micah, “I will indeed gather all of you, Jacob; I will collect the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in the middle of its pasture” (Micah 2:12). He tells them there is One who will break open the way for them, and then lead them into freedom.\nIndeed, a deliverer came and freed the remnant from captivity; and Jesus, our Deliverer, has already come to free us from our oppressive slavery to sin from which we once lived. But even while we’ve been set free through the cross, resurrection, and ascension of Christ Jesus, we still struggle to find contentment in that freedom. We often struggle to rest in Him, returning to our old ways, despite their ugliness and oppression. \nBy grace, may we heed and reflect on God’s message through the prophet Micah. May we look forward to God’s coming judgment, and turn our hearts toward Him in repentance. And may we learn to cling to the finished work of Jesus Christ, resting in our deliverance secured in Him. \nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

Do you think it was okay to sneak into the kitchen in the middle of the night and eat all the Pringles? Is it right to hit your friend? \nNo, no, no.\nAnd when God asks Jonah if it’s right for him to be angry, we know the correct answer.\nJonah is ticked at God’s grace. He can’t believe that God would be so gracious and kind to the city of Nineveh. As Jonah stews in his anger, God asks him if his anger is justified. \nNo answer. Not yet.\nAfter witnessing a revival in Nineveh, Jonah heads back home. While resting, God provides shade for Jonah and puts him at ease. Everything is going Jonah’s way. Finally. But then, the Lord sends a worm to destroy the plant, toppling Jonah’s temporary comfort and happiness. Things aren’t going Jonah’s way anymore. \nJonah rants and raves against the plant, and God asks Jonah if he’s right to be angry. Jonah thinks so. But God reminds Jonah of his place in the universe. The prophet had nothing to do with the plant. He didn’t plant it or grow it. It doesn’t truly belong to him. Jonah only cared about the plant because of what it gave him. His anger came when his comfort was removed and his selfishness exposed.\nJonah only cared about Jonah. God cared about the city of Nineveh, filled with people made in His image. Jonah was angry because Jonah was the most important thing to Jonah. And if I’m honest, most of my anger is about one person: Me, Me, Me.\nIs your anger me-filled? You will live in a state of anger if you only care about you. Jonah cared more about his shade than he did the revival that broke out in Nineveh. Do you care more about the kingdom of God than the barista getting your coffee order right? Do you get more upset by the traffic in your city or the fact that thousands in your city don’t know the risen Christ? Is your anger right?\nOur emotions reveal our greatest passions. May the crucified and risen Christ, His kingdom and His name, be our greatest passion.\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n                ",

He made it very clear that he wasn’t comfortable visiting our church. In fact, this was the first time he had set foot in a church, period. After the service, he pulled me aside and made a hesitant comment about my sermon on Jonah that I will never forget. He said, “The gospel you preached just seems too good to be true. If you knew me, you would understand why.” I simply responded, “David, it may seem that way, but let me assure you, it is true.” \nHe returned the next week and the next. A month later, he walked into my office with tears streaming down his face and earnestly called out to God for salvation. David had come to realize the depth of his sin, and experienced the overwhelming grace of God in Christ.\nThe message of God in the book of Jonah is a message of grace. In chapter 3, Nineveh’s evil had come up before God. It was in the depth of their depravity that the Ninevites were met with the eternally significant words of the prophet: Repent, or God will destroy this city! This may not seem like a message of grace. But we have to remember, every warning before final judgment is an act of mercy. \nIt is simply astonishing that, in response to Jonah’s call for repentance, the people of Nineveh believed God. In fact, the entire city put on a fast and covered themselves in sackcloth, expressing grief, humility, and remorse. \nAs Christians, we can become so familiar with God’s grace that we lose sight of how amazing it is. The city of Nineveh was notorious in the ancient world for their wickedness. Of the city, the prophet Nahum declared, “Woe to the city of blood, totally deceitful, full of plunder, never without prey” (Nahum 3:1). By all self-righteous standards, Nineveh was the least deserving of God’s grace. But this narrative reminds us that it doesn’t matter if you are a Ninevite or my friend David; the grace of God is not deserved. That is what makes it grace.\nEveryone can call out earnestly to God. In fact, everyone must call out earnestly to God. We are all great sinners, but thanks be to God, Christ is a great Savior. It’s true when you come to terms with the deep depravity of your heart, the gospel may seem too good to be true. But it is true. Let us never lose sight of the power of the gospel.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

Satan had a field day, tempting me in several ways. I often felt like Jonah in today’s passage, calling out to the Lord in distress.\nJonah and I were in different spots. His struggles and loneliness came from his running from the Lord’s call. Mine came from a work and study trip. Jonah knew God was sovereign, but he also knew he was on the boat because of disobedience, avoiding God’s call for him to go to Nineveh. So he jumped overboard rather than facing the God he was running from. He took his chances in the open sea rather than turning his eyes to the heavens. \nJonah feared the uncontrollable. I was no different while on my trip, and even today. So often I find myself trying to white-knuckle it, trying to convince myself to simply feel better. I try to take things into my own hands, just like Jonah. And like me, Jonah didn’t turn to God, the only One who can give any of us true rest.\nIt’s easy to judge Jonah. We pretend as though we’d answer the Lord’s call and go wherever He called us to go. But I know in my own life, I’m often just like the runaway prophet. \nEvery one of us is in the same spot as Jonah. We all need the Lord every day, and yet we often run from Him, jumping into the sea instead of lifting our eyes to the heavens. But if, like Jonah, we call out to the Lord, He will answer. God doesn’t ignore our cries for help. He doesn’t tell us to ask someone else to fix our desperate situations. He hears our cries and proves Himself faithful. “Therefore, let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in time of need” (Hebrews 4:16).\nWhat in your life feels like the storm that rocked Jonah’s boat? In what ways have you jumped overboard, choosing the chaos of the sea over the peace of heaven? Call on the Lord. Lift your eyes and approach Him with assurance. He stands ready to bring you to dry land.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

Imagine how early I had to set my alarm so I could have enough time to get up, get dressed, and get to work. It was early! I genuinely hated my job. Working there was taking me in a direction I did not want to go. Every time my alarm went off, I wanted nothing more than to hit snooze, roll over, and go back to sleep.\nIn the story of Jonah, God was like an alarm clock telling Jonah to get up and go to work. Jonah didn’t want to go. And he didn’t just choose to hit the snooze button; he decided not to show up at all. In fact, he tried to run as far away from the job as he could. \nWhen Jonah hopped on a boat to escape God and dodge the call to preach to Nineveh, a violent storm nearly sank his getaway vehicle. As this great storm threatened to destroy the ship, Jonah was sleeping so deeply he wasn’t even phased by the storm. How in the world was Jonah so dead asleep? Though we’d be guessing, of course, it’s possible Jonah was actively avoiding God’s call even in his sleep. Often we sleep not only because we’re tired, but because we’re trying to shut ourselves down completely—physically, spiritually, and relationally. God was calling Jonah to wake up to the needs of the people God asked him to serve. This was what Jonah was trying to sleep through—not just the storm.\nJonah did not want to obey God’s command to do the work he was called and equipped to do. As with other reluctant servants in Scripture, it’s easy to scoff at Jonah for being disobedient. But let’s be honest for a minute, friends. How many of us have been instructed by God to “get up” and go do something? How many of us, like Jonah, think we can escape not only the call on our lives, but also the presence of the One who calls us?\nIn Jonah’s story, we see there is no getaway vehicle that can outrun God’s faithful presence. The gospel of Jesus tells believers that though we may run from God, He faithfully chases us with His grace. \nWhen we find ourselves hitting the snooze button on God’s alarm clock, perhaps it’s time to wake up. Perhaps it’s time to trust in the One calling us, and go where we believe He’s sending us. Even in our disobedience, we will never be able to outrun the steadfast, constant, and gracious love of God that strengthens us. \nWritten by Jevon Washington\n\n                ",

But it takes a special kind of self-reliance to haul the kids up the mountain without knowing the length of the trail. Hiking in the North Cascades, we shared big hopes to see mountain lakes and snow-capped peaks. And as the pater familias—“the father of the family”—I knew exactly who should be the one to choose the trail to lead us there. \nAfter what seemed like hours of hot trudging back and forth and up and down over the switchbacks, my family was starting to wilt. We pressed on, in spite of the children’s protestations, and made it to the end of the trail. What I’d thought would be a quick quarter-mile walk turned into what I now assumed was a seven-mile journey.\nWhen we got back to the trailhead, ice cream promised to the children, I saw that I was wrong in both coming and going. I had chosen the wrong trail in the first place, and then underestimated its length; the trail was actually four miles long. Despite my confidence at the outset, and my wife’s loving support, I had misread everything.\nDo you trust yourself? This can be a complex question to answer, but I reckon most of us trust ourselves to a great degree. I find that my proclivity is to trust my own judgment, my own opinions, my own perspective. And this is often what gets me in trouble, because all of these things—judgment, opinions, perspective—are the fiercest arenas of spiritual warfare. Here, the flesh and the Spirit battle. \nWe love to arm ourselves with worldly securities, with finances and influence, possessions and talents. To have such things is no sin, but to trust in them causes great peril. When we trust in our own strength, in our own fleshly accumulations, we find that all our allies have driven us to our borders, deceived us, and even conquered us (v.7). \nWhen we lean on our own understanding, the pride of our hearts deceives us (v.3). We become like Edom, the recipient of Obadiah’s message of judgment. \nMatthew Henry observed: “Those that make flesh their trust, arm it against themselves.” The folly of Edom was this trust in self, in the strength of arms, in strongholds and lofty dwellings. Their faith was in a kingdom of this world.\nFaith always leads to practice. Worldly trusts inevitably lead to worldly living, and for Edom, the natural fruit of their self-trust was disregard for their neighbors, Israel. In arrogance, Edom stood by aloof and idle as Israel suffered, gloating over the calamity of God’s people, and believing it to be a means for their own gain. \nThis is a persistent and natural temptation for all of us, no matter how we dress it up. But thankfully, the new kingdom will be the Lord’s (v.21), and His kingdom is not built upon earthly trusts. What a great blessing, to see this prophecy already fulfilled in our own day! Though partial fulfillment was evident in Israel’s return to the land of Palestine, the final fulfillment is in Christ, who has come to upend all false and worldly faith. \nThe kingdom of the world is now the kingdom of God and of His Christ (Revelation 11:15). May we, with grateful hearts, honor Christ alone as King. May we yield all our trust to Him, and may His kingdom come and His will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

I have no memory of living in a house longer than three years until I was 35 years old, so I have never really associated home with an address or an ornate front door knocker. I often wonder what it’s like for people who have lived in the same house their whole life: same address, same phone number, same neighbors, same drive to school, not to mention the same school. There is something about that life, one with a place called “home,” that I can’t relate to very much.\nI think moving gets in your blood and eventually becomes normal. It might be unhealthy, but this is normal to me. This gypsy life does have its benefits: you develop a knack for making friends quickly; you never feel lost (or you always do and it just becomes a familiar feeling); and you accept that change is a part of life. But there are plenty of downfalls, too—mainly that commitment becomes a struggle, a long-range view of the future is nonexistent, and roots are hard to plant.\nOne of the great promises of the gospel is that we will be rooted—home at last, forever in the place we belong, where we are fully known and fully loved. \nWe can try to take it upon ourselves to put down roots that can’t be pulled up, to try and make ourselves secure. But on a spiritual level, this is not something we can do on our own. As today’s text points out, this is something God must do. \nGod will plant His people, and they shall never again be uprooted. This is a gift from God—having a place, a story, a history, an identity, all from Him. How often do we toil to create our own place and security? How often are we let down because it just isn’t what we’d hoped?\nWhat is the uprooting that you fear most? God’s promise of a home is beyond any space we could call our own apart from Him. The place He establishes for us will never be taken away. He will never uproot us from His promises, and He will never leave us or forsake us.\nWritten by Jason Tippetts\n\n                ",

Switchback after switchback, the going was slow, but the views were more than rewarding. My wife and I were comfortably lost in casual Sunday afternoon conversation.\nAfter a couple more seconds, it registered that we should not be hearing anybody’s sprinkler at this altitude and time of day. That’s when we both saw it.\nOut of the corner of our eyes, my wife and I both saw the rattlesnake’s head and torso rising up out of the tall grass. Its tongue was flickering, and from about 4 feet off the trail to our right-hand side, its eyes had drawn a bead directly on us.\nI turned to my wife and our eyes locked in unison before we booked it down the path.\nTalk about an adrenaline rush. Whew, buddy!\nMy heart and demeanor jumped into high gear, from slightly careless and complacent, to ultra-vigilant and alert. I have thanked God dozens of times for protecting us from that close call.\nWhile the comparison is not perfect, I think I understand a bit more clearly Amos’s message from our reading today: “Woe to the complacent!” Granted, we were simply taking an afternoon stroll, whereas Amos was addressing a people who had grown spiritually and morally corrupt in the midst of comfort and luxury. So, big difference in context. However, to be jarred rapidly out of your comfort zone is something that I am freshly familiar with.\nIf I’m honest with myself, my spiritual life can often be this way. Have you ever noticed that in your own life? It’s when we’re most comfortable materially and most secure socially that we begin to invest less and less into our spiritual well-being and our relationship with God. \nThere’s an old adage which says the truth ought to “afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted,” and that is exactly the paradigm we see in Amos and many of the other Minor Prophets. \nThe Lord gave the prophet a vision of the impending destruction that was the result of the people’s wayward behavior. This was an act of divine kindness. It was like the sound of the rattlesnake on the path. \nWhen God uses affliction or trouble to wake us from our complacency or slumber, it is always a gift of mercy, lest we wander off into what can hurt us. And when Amos heard the warning and cried out, “Lord God, please forgive!” (7:2), the Lord heard his prayers, and they were answered immediately. Our God is a God of rescue and grace.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

So I bought Bob Dylan’s Greatest Hits, his first compilation album. The first song was “Rainy Day Women #12 & 35,” which is a rollicking good-time song. But then it came on, and for the first time I really heard it.\nA lament.\nI did not have that category in hand to dignify the song and my feelings along with it. All I knew was how I felt while listening. It was a protest song. It sounded like the most beautiful indictment of injustice I’d ever heard…\nHow many roads must a man walk down\nBefore you call him a man\nAs far as I was concerned, it sounded like one of the Old Testament prophets decrying the injustice of God’s people who had been given so much.\nWhen God, through the prophet Amos, rails against Israel in chapter 5, it is a lament—a lament over their sins of injustice and their lack of seeking after Him in a life of repentance and holiness.\nMore than once in that chapter is the command to seek the Lord, and then there is that famous verse 24: “But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an overflowing stream.” But here is what’s most interesting to me: while the people appear to be doing what is commanded of them by God, He still does not seem very impressed by them.\n“I hate, I despise your feasts,\nand I take no delight in your solemn assemblies.\nEven though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings,\nI will not accept them;\nand the peace offerings of your fattened animals,\nI will not look upon them.\nTake away from me the noise of your songs;\nto the melody of your harps I will not listen” (Amos 5:21-23).\nWhat is going on here?\nWell, that famous verse 24 gives us a clue. God wants justice and righteousness. Israel may be doing all of the outward requirements of the law, but what they really need is an internal change of the heart.\nImagine a church full of people who sing wonderfully, listen to the sermon, give their tithes, and practice the sacraments rightly. But they cannot get along and be kind to others, much less to the vulnerable. And morally speaking, they are a mess. That’s a good picture of Israel. They needed to be changed from the inside out.\nWe can easily fall into the same trap. We think doing all the right things—church attendance, quiet times, tithing, etc.—will buy us favor with God. But Amos chapter 5 points to the futility of such thinking. We need to hear this lament, and then “seek Him and live.”\nWhen we seek Jesus, as revealed in the gospel, we see not only the futility of our efforts to earn God’s favor, but also His provision of a changed life. This kind of freedom allows us to pursue justice and righteousness, not to gain His favor, but because we already have it.\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

Santa Claus is a never-harm-a-fly, squishy, happy old man who gives out toys and delights to children all around the world. And sadly, a lot of people think of the Almighty God in this way too. Many picture God as some old man in heaven with rosy cheeks and a big beard; the worst He’ll do is give you a lump of coal.\nAmos is an armageddon against all Santa-like thoughts of the Almighty God.\nThe prophet Amos proclaims a side of God we don’t gravitate toward. Amos reminds us of God’s war helmet, His military boots, and His might to tear down the nations. Forget the fuzzy red hat. In Amos, God is rocking the regalia of a five-star general to the infinite power. The God of Armies is His name. He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords. He is the great master and commander. God would make Alexander the Great break out in a cold sweat. Napoleon would hide under his bed when facing this God of Armies.\nGod’s might is unmatched. No one can be delivered from His disciplining action. Israel knows this first hand. Their rebellion against the God of Armies brought the swift strike of discipline—and love.\nRemember, “For the Lord disciplines the one he loves” (Hebrews 12:6). God disciplines His children because He loves us. If He didn’t love us, He’d let us do our own thing. But like every loving parent—the kind who doesn’t let their kid run wild without boundaries—He reins us in, even if it takes a strong tug on the arm, or a nail through His own wrist.\nThe God of Armies loves us to a degree that leaves us slack-jawed. The God of Armies carried out His wrath on Jesus, instead of you and me. The God of Armies is not against us—He is for us. By faith in Christ’s death and resurrection, we are with Him. We are on His side. \nThe God of Armies loved us so much that He sent us His Son, Jesus of Nazareth, to die in our place and for our sins. The Minor Prophets remind me of Christmas for this reason too—we need the incarnate Messiah to save us from our sin and from the wrath of the God of Armies. And this is precisely what Christ does.\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Fire is both beautiful and dangerous. There is something about it that seems to draw us in. When I sit in front of a fire pit on a crisp dark night, I find that I am often mesmerized. But while fire attracts with its stunning movement and color, it also repels with its dangerous heat. It’s a fascinating paradox: you cannot get too close to it without being injured, and at the same time, you cannot look away. \nIt is no coincidence that in the Bible, God’s presence is often made manifest in fire. His holiness and wrath against sin cause us to approach Him with humility and reverence as broken sinners. And, in the first few chapters of Amos, the writer marshals the attention of the rebellious Israelites by using fire as a primary metaphor in his message. For Amos in particular, the imagery of fire is predominately used for judgment. It is abundantly clear in Amos chapters 1 and 2, that in response to Israel’s repeated rebellion, “God will not revoke the punishment” (1:3). Our God roars from Zion!\nAnd yet, even as God has decided to judge the world for sin, His gavel falls only after a season of patient endurance. Thankfully, in the sweep of biblical history, we are able to see that God is slow to anger (Psalm 103:8). Like the Israelites of the Old Testament, we can cry, “Lord, have mercy.” And thankfully, God answers that cry, extending mercy to those who honor and fear Him (Psalm 33:18-19). \nWith the coming of Christ, the fire of judgment has been lit. The question for all of us is this: Will we cry out to God for mercy in Jesus Christ? Every person that has ever lived will acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord. That means that either we repent and confess Him by faith now, or we will confess Him in shame and terror on the last day. We will either be consumed in fiery wrath on the last day, or we can become the products of fiery refinement today. Our response to the gospel determines our outcome in the final day of fire.\nThe good news of the gospel is this: it is by grace through faith in Christ alone that we are delivered from death (Ephesians 2:8). He is calling out to us. “The Lord roars from Zion and makes his voice heard from Jerusalem” (Amos 1:2). And while we approach God with both humility and reverence, as Christians we can also rest in His steadfast love. \nO Lord, be upon us, even as we hope in you.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

In order to stir up the reality of this truth in our minds and hearts, the Lord sets the stage, painting the picture of all the nations being brought before Him in judgment in the valley of Jehoshaphat, in order to “enter into judgment with them there” (v. 2).\nIn that valley, the Lord holds the nations in contempt for all the ways they have oppressed His people (vv. 4-8), and then calls the nations to appear before Him as in a battle. The outcome is most certainly judgment and desolation (v. 19).\nJoel draws a strong contrast between the nations and the people of God (vv. 16-21). Instead of executing judgment in the “winepress” of His wrath (v. 13), the Lord promises to make “the mountains drip with new wine” (v. 18). Instead of making a desolate wilderness out of His enemies (v. 19), the Lord promised to send a streambed and a fountain forth from His house for the blessing of His people (v. 18). Borrowing language that reminds us of the blessings of God in the garden of Eden, the Lord symbolizes the spiritual blessings He will give His people in Christ.\nWhat makes the difference between Israel and the nations? Why has God promised to be a refuge to His people when they deserve exactly the same treatment as that of the nations? The answer is discovered in the references to Judah—“the streambeds of Judah” that will leave “Judah inhabited forever” (Joel 3:18-21). Jesus is the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the One who drinks the bitter cup of wrath in the place of His people, so they can drink the sweet wine that flows from the mountain of His grace. \nGod’s promises are good and true because of who He is. As we look to Him by faith, we will find not just the face of our Judge, but the face of our Savior as well.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    “Because I said so.” \nThis was a sentence I loathed as a child. Whenever my parents or teachers said it, I could feel my hackles rise, and I don’t even have hackles. It felt like such an in-your-face display of authority. Why must I do this thing? Because they said so. That didn’t feel like a reason. It felt dismissive, even if their position of authority gave them every right to command me without providing what I deemed a proper explanation.\nToday’s passage from Joel essentially says, “Because I said so”—but with a twist. Instead of it being a blunt or dismissive command, it is a promise. Because I said so. Who? God. That is, after all, what the entire sentence is hinging on: The person who makes the promise determines its validity and efficacy. And in this case, God is the one making the promise.\nIsrael was under duress from invaders, as judgment for their own rebellion against God. They were in captivity, facing starvation, and had lost their home. So, as they’d done throughout the Old Testament, they cried out to God, and, as He’d done throughout the Old Testament, God listened. He offered them a glorious promise of feasting and health, of vindication, and of fullness. The people could “rejoice and be glad, for the Lord has done astonishing things” (Joel 2:21).\nThey could rejoice because He said so—the same God who had done astonishing things dating back to the creation of the world. This passage echoes of those things. It echoes of Jubilee (Leviticus 25)—a freeing and redeeming time—when God promised Israel, “I will repay you for the lost years” (Joel 2:25). It echoes of the burning bush and of Sinai (Exodus 3;19-24). These are markers, reminders of God’s sovereignty, which prove that He is the Lord and there is no other (Joel 2:27). \nThroughout the Minor Prophets, God threads these I AM—or “Because I said so”—phrases so people will know the promises are true. He reminds the hearer repeatedly, “I am the Lord.” Why? Because in times of trial (and in times of ease) we forget. We forget who we are and whose we are. We forget what God has done in the past and lose sight of His help both now and in the future. \nBut God knew this about us, and so He promised the pouring out of His Spirit (Joel 2:28,32)—“the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father!” (Romans 8:15), and the seal of God upon those who love Him (Ephesians 1:13). He gave us His Spirit to remind us of what’s true.  \nGod has promised us restoration and redemption. But He also promises us Himself. And just like He did for Israel through the prophet Joel, He promises to deliver us to fullness, joy, and health, too—a Jubilee to those who belong to Him. That is our future promise. And though we don’t know when it will come true, we can trust Him to bring this, and all of His promises, into fruition, because He said so. \nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

You may remember the scene—it’s one of the only good ones in the prequels.\nObi-Wan pleads with Anakin. He knows he has the higher ground, that Anakin has no chance of defeating him. And so in an effort to prevent Anakin’s self-destruction, Obi-Wan begs him to stop, saying, “You were the chosen one! It was said you would destroy the Sith, not join them!”\nIn the book of Joel, we see the people of God rebelling against His compassionate rule yet again. A plague of locusts has stolen the wine and grain that the people of God rely on for the sacrifices of atonement they make to Yahweh. “The day of the Lord is near,” God says through Joel, and with the day of the Lord comes the righteous judgment of all people (Joel 1:15). But in the face of imminent judgment and destruction, God cannot let His people stay where they are in their rebellion.\nAnd so once again, through His prophet Joel, God calls out to His people: “Turn to me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning. Tear your hearts, not just your clothes, and return to the Lord your God” (Joel 2:12-13a). The Lord is pleading with His people to repent and return to their rightful place, worshiping Him as His chosen people.\nLike a loving Father with a wayward child, God’s heart breaks for His rebellious people. In His justice, He cannot withhold His judgment, and in His grace, He calls them to repentance. “Who knows?” the prophet writes, “He may turn and relent and leave a blessing behind him, so you can offer grain and wine to the Lord your God” (v.14).\nEven when we trust in the finished work of Christ to free us from our slavery to sin, we still rebel against the goodness of God. Even as we grow in Christ’s likeness, we forget that the day of the Lord is coming and that we will face judgment. But in love, the Holy Spirit within us cries out, reminding us of who we are as children of God, and calling us to repentance. “For he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in faithful love, and he relents from sending disaster” (v.13b).\nTear your hardened heart, and let the grace of God soften it, making it whole in Christ.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

They’re mostly short books, so they’re often flipped right over on accident, and they’re usually not real peachy. The book of Joel isn’t much different.\nJoel is a textbook prophet, though. The prophets’ ultimate job was to pronounce, on behalf of the LORD, blessing and judgment on God’s people. If they obeyed God, they’d be rewarded. If they disobeyed, they would experience His wrath. We should not avoid these parts of Scripture because they’re terrifying or seem less important than, say, the book of Psalms or the Gospels. But every word of God’s Word has a word for us. Yes, even the book of Joel.\nNo doubt, it can be difficult to read passages like today’s and find them applicable to us. But that may be, at least in part, because we don’t understand the goodness of God’s warning of judgment. None of us like to be disciplined, but as we’re told in Hebrews, our Father’s discipline is for our good. Good dads discipline their children (Hebrews 12:6-11).\nIn this passage, we see words like “tremble” and “devastation,” but we also see the promise of God’s salvation. God disciplines because He loves, and He judges because He cares about righteousness. His awesome presence ought to cause holy fear and trembling, and yet, we also know that He is good and merciful to those who love Him. \nRemember the words of Romans 10:13: “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” This is why Jesus was sent into the world. In love, the Father sent Him for our salvation. He saw our sin, and sent His Son to die for it. He heard our cries, even the cries we didn’t know how to let out (Romans 8:26-27).\nIf His coming brings fear in your heart, if His discipline feels too strong, you’re invited to cry out to Him. He is not detached. He listens. He hears. He responds. Call on His name.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

They are like a giant eraser, wiping clean the chalky fields of Israel. The Lord wants His people to know the plague is meant to wake them up to their need to repent. Devastation and desperation have this effect on people. It will cause us to cry out to the Lord for salvation (Joel 1:14).\nJoel is one of the Minor Prophets in Scripture. What are the Minor Prophets, you ask? For starters, they are books, not people. There are twelve of them: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. These books are called “minor” because of their length. Compared to the “major” prophets—Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Daniel—they are relatively short. But they are no less important than any other part of God’s holy Word.\nBooks like Joel confront, head on, the fracturing effects of sin and present a God who is committed to rooting it out, no matter how deep it runs. We need that. Occasionally, as we see in these opening verses from Joel, God roots out sin by bringing us low. I don’t know about you, but I often need to be humbled before I have ears to listen to the Lord.\nJoel and the other Minor Prophets talk a lot about judgment, but they also talk about hope. Today, we see the judgment of God from this side of Christ’s finished work on the cross. We take comfort in knowing God’s wrath has been satisfied through Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection.\nIt is tempting to want to distance ourselves from really studying the wrath and judgment of God. It can be uncomfortable to look at. But when we turn aside from examining God’s righteous judgment, we lose sight of His holiness and majesty, and in the process also lose a sense of the magnificence of Christ’s sacrifice on our behalf.\nThe Minor Prophets help us with this. If we come to these books—books like Joel—with a humble posture, they will break our hearts in the best way. They show the darkness of sin and leave us desperate for a salvation none of us could accomplish on our own. The Minor Prophets remind us of our hope in Christ, as they also remind us that apart from Him, we have no other hope.\nAs you read through these books, perhaps a good verse to keep at the ready, in order to remember both our desperation and God’s salvation in Christ, is Joel 1:14:\nAnnounce a sacred fast;\nproclaim an assembly!\nGather the elders\nand all the residents of the land\nat the house of the Lord your God,\nand cry out to the Lord.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    It’s been noted by many a preacher that one of the most repeated commands in Scripture is to not be afraid. Oftentimes, the recipients of this instruction were frightened by seemingly insurmountable trials, challenges, or enemies. Those things can cause us to fear too. It’s a natural human reaction, especially when we forget God is always with us.  \nThat was the case in Haggai 2; the people were discouraged and afraid. Rebuilding the temple was no small feat, and they felt overwhelmed with the task and the problems they were facing. They were stuck and were stalling. Even though they were likely excited about worshiping God in the temple once again, the arduous process and demanding labor was enough to dampen their spirits. Plus, they thought the rebuilt temple could never measure up to the glory of the former temple (v.3).\nGod’s loving proclamation in the midst of their discouragement was, “My Spirit is present among you; don’t be afraid” (v.5). Instead of promising them that their challenges would suddenly disappear, God comforted His people by reminding them of His presence. The people needed to pivot from their unhealthy fear of the task before them to a healthy fear and respect for God, the Most High. They needed to remember His Spirit was with them to direct and strengthen them for the work they were called to do.\nMisplaced fear is crippling. It keeps us focused on our lack of resources, the size of our problems, and the strength of opposition we face. By contrast, God-honoring fear is rooted in reverential awe, worship, and a trusting relationship with our all-powerful God and Father. This kind of fear is freeing, healing, and energizing. Scripture tells us that “the fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom” (Proverbs 9:10). We won’t be able to sustain wise, courageous action apart from the fear of the Lord.\nIt’s easy to look at the Israelites’ cycles of fear—from misplaced to proper, and back around again—and wonder how they could have missed the mark. This might be because we have the luxury of observing their stories from a distance. If we step back and examine our own lives with some degree of objectivity, we might see the same pattern of belief and unbelief, of faith and fear. We’re not so different from them.\nI suspect fighting fear is something we will have to do our whole lives; it will never completely go away in this life. Knowing that, and knowing our proclivity to fear the wrong things, my prayer is that we’d focus on growing in a healthy, life-giving fear of the Lord. Fear rooted in the goodness and power of God propels us forward, despite the obstacles we face. It’s a fear that’s powerful enough to overcome all our other fears. So, let’s pursue the only fear that leads to peace—the fear of the Lord.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

My wife and I play referee every single day, telling them to be nice to one another, to be kind, to be gentle, and on and on it goes.\nAfter a recent fight, I sat them down to have a conversation about family. I asked, “Do you know what it means for us to be a family?” To which my five-year-old replied, “It means we all have to share the same snacks.” I chuckled and said, “Well, yes, but more importantly, it means that we belong to one another. No matter what happens, this house is the place we all come back to. We’re always here for each other, no matter what. So even though you might have disagreements with your sister, remember that you are family and you should always forgive one another.”\nJudging by their argument a few hours later, I’m pretty sure my message didn’t stick. But our passage today reminds me of that conversation. When we read Haggai 1, we might wonder why God is so bent on having His temple built. If God is everywhere, why does He need a temple? Why would anyone need to go to a temple to meet with Him? It can seem like an unnecessary concern on God’s part.\nBut God’s temple was the place where His presence dwelt with His people in a special way. He says, “I am with you—this is the LORD’s declaration” (v.13). God wants His people to know He is with them, and no circumstance they face will separate them from Him. Even so, the temple showed God’s people that He wanted to be with them. He was so committed to them that He encouraged them to press on and rebuild it. The temple was for them—to shape their identity as God’s people. Much like how a roof over my kids’ heads doesn’t make them my kids, our house, nevertheless, represents a place of belonging, of love, of protection. It helps my kids remember they belong to the family.\nPaul told the Ephesians, “You are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with the saints, and members of God’s household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone” (Ephesians 2:19–20). Our passage today points to this greater truth. God has always wanted to dwell with His people—He has always “templed” with them—from the garden of Eden to the sending of the Holy Spirit.\nThe temple’s reconstruction all the way back in Haggai was another promise kept by God. The sending of the Son and the sending of the Spirit are more signs God hasn’t abandoned His people. And so we look forward to that day described in Revelation 21, when God will come down from heaven and we will spend eternity with Him, never again separated by our sin. He will be our God, and we will be His people forever.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    It’s almost weekly that we hear of some new corruption scandal—a man or woman in a position of power preying on the weak and vulnerable. It’s maddening. It’s nauseating. These stories of oppression and injustice tempt us to lose our faith in God’s providential governance of our world. Where is justice? Where is God?\nToday’s injustices are not unlike the situation in ancient Israel, where leaders acted like wolves under the cover of darkness, devouring the innocent and leaving nothing but waste for morning (Zephaniah 3:3). Yet Scripture reminds us that God remains just. He “applies his justice morning by morning; he does not fail at dawn” (v.5). We set our hope in His ability to set things right, knowing He is the only one who can. \nLearning to trust God while being treated unfairly demonstrates faith. It is acting by waiting. It is patiently believing God will act at the right time and in the right way. It is clinging to the words of the prophet Isaiah: “The LORD is waiting to show you mercy, and is rising up to show you compassion, for the LORD is a just God. All who wait patiently for him are happy“ (30:18). \nThe need to trust God in the midst of injustice and suffering is no different today than it was in ancient Israel. Even our best leaders are flawed, and our worst leaders can be tyrants. The presence of unfit and unrighteous leaders generates longing for the one true leader who will bring about perfect justice. Jesus is that perfect leader. He not only seeks justice but is able to bring it to His people. With His first coming, He established His rule—the kingdom has come. It is already here. Yet the full experience of His kingdom, of His perfect rule, lies in the hope of His future return, when everything will be set right forever. \nAs we wait in the night, let us be reminded that the Son has come, and is coming again. And when He returns, it will be the dawn of a new age when justice and righteousness will prevail forever. A new age in which our present earthly rulers will seem but frail shadows when compared to the perfect rule of the Son, who will shine brighter than we can imagine.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    What would you do if you went to the mailbox today and found a letter from a foreign world leader of a small, unimposing nation—a letter telling you your time was short and his fury would soon come, bringing an end to your family, home, community, and entire way of life? How would you handle the threat of being wiped off the face of the earth in a display of his power and terrible anger?\nIf it were me, I’d probably toss the letter into the trash and completely disregard it. I couldn’t fathom any scenario where my way of life could be threatened so seriously by an insignificant foreign nation while living in a so-called superpower. No way, no how, could that happen in my lifetime. At least that’s what I’d be tempted to think.\nI imagine something similar was going through the minds of those who received Zephaniah’s prophetic message in chapter 2. Perhaps the Philistines just laughed. The Moabites and Ammonites might have looked at their lands and temples and shrugged their shoulders. The powerful kingdom of Assyria and its capital, Nineveh, most likely didn’t even consider the threats from the God of Israel to be problematic. They are of the “jubilant city that lives in security, that thinks to herself: I exist, and there is no one else” (v.15).\nReceiving this kind of message from a seemingly inferior power would not generate any kind of response other than to just go about life normally. And that’s the problem. Unless people really know who God is and how they have rebelled against His glory, they will be unconcerned about His impending judgment over all the earth. Even those of us who are in Christ can remain somewhat oblivious to God’s righteousness and His just punishment of sin.   \nSandwiched between the message of the coming day of the Lord and the judgment of the nations are three beautiful verses pointing us in a new direction toward humility. To those who are “undesirable” (2:2), a message of grace gives hope and provides a way of escape from God’s impending wrath. It’s a call to humble repentance, to seek mercy and forgiveness from the hand of our Maker.\nThe prophet’s “perhaps” (v.3) isn’t meant to be read as if he’s saying, “Maybe you’ll find mercy if you’re lucky.” It was meant to give the people of Judah hope, and it’s meant to point us to the cross, where Jesus absorbed the full fury of God’s anger on our behalf. He concealed us from death by His own death, so that we might know the mercy and love of God.\nHow will you receive God’s warning to repent and believe, and to continue to do so? Will you receive it with pride, thinking you’re secure in and of yourself? Or will you receive it with humility, depending only on God’s grace to cover your sin and need?\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When I get home from work in the afternoon, I can tell by my children’s reaction to my entrance how they behaved that day. Some days, I walk through the door and am surrounded by kids who are thankful to see me. Other days, the sound of the doorknob turning sends children flying up to their rooms, hoping I won’t come up and ask the dreaded question, “How was your day?” My return home either means a fun rest of the afternoon or a difficult conversation about their behavior.\nThe Bible paints the “day of the Lord” with brushstrokes that depend on the audience. Zephaniah, writing in the days before the Babylonian captivity, portrayed the day of the Lord as a day of wrath and fury. He said, “The great day of the LORD is near, near and rapidly approaching” (1:14). Then he laid out what people can expect on that “great day”:\n“That day is a terrible day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of destruction and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and total darkness, a day of trumpet blast and battle cry against the fortified cities, and against the high corner towers” (vv.15–16).\nZephaniah spoke the “word of the LORD” (v.1), declaring that the day of the Lord would usher in terrible wrath and distress. The great city’s walls and defenses would be no match for God, who would lay waste to those cities. A trumpet blast would declare His appearance for battle against those who had rebelled against Him.\nPeter strikes a different tone when he speaks of the Lord’s return. He pictures it as a day his readers ought to look forward to. He reminds them that the Lord’s delay is not because He forgot His promise, but because He is giving more people more time to repent and believe. They are called to wait patiently for His return, understanding it will happen “like a thief” (2 Peter 3:10). On that day, the “elements will burn and be dissolved,” but “we wait for a new heavens and a new earth” (v.10,13).\nThe day of the Lord will be a day that is both great and terrible. The dam holding back the wrath of God will break, and all who have escaped justice will no longer be able to hide. Yet, for those who are in Christ, the flood of God’s wrath has already been poured out on Him. We no longer have to look at the Lord’s return with fear, trembling at His coming, as those who have no hope. The day of the Lord holds great promise for us. We look forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where we will reign with Christ in glorified bodies. Because of the new life we have in Christ, we say, “Come, Lord Jesus!” (Revelation 22:20). \nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In what seems like another lifetime now, our children were small, as in preschool and kindergarten age small. During those years, a craze was afoot—scrapbooking—and my wife was all in. In some sense it was an analog version of Instagram. You took pictures constantly, trying to capture those special moments. Then you’d get the film developed and arrange the pictures in a scrapbook, complete with handwritten text, tagging who was in the photo and what was going on. Sound familiar? There was special paper, special pens, special stickers, special adhesive tape. It was crazy. But it was also special. Here’s why.\nIf we had ever experienced a house fire while our kids were small, do you know what they would have grabbed on their way to our designated safe place outside? You guessed it—those scrapbooks. They were, and still are, one of their most treasured possessions. There are probably a handful of reasons why that is, but I believe the primary one to be this: those scrapbooks tell them who they are and where they come from—and, most importantly, who loves them more than anything. Those photos and text awe them, they reveal the amazing experiences they had in the past, and that gives our kids confidence to keep moving into their unknown futures.\nHabakkuk could pray, “LORD, I stand in awe of your deeds” (3:2), because he had heard the report of all the amazing things God had done in the past. And the recounting of those miracles and wonders gave him confidence to continue on, regardless of what the future held. It’s in those moments that Habakkuk’s confidence in God was bolstered by the words and pictures, if you will, of God’s faithfulness in the past.\nThat’s a key reason why consistently reading and studying God’s Word is so important to our lives. In a very real sense, the Bible is a scrapbook that reveals to us the ways of God. Yes, you’re right: the Bible often feels like another lifetime now (probably because it was), but here’s the deal: the same God Habakkuk prayed to is the same God we pray to today. In fact, He’s the very same God who “became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:14). Those scriptural snapshots tell us who we are and where we come from—and, most importantly, about the God who loves us with a never-ending love. They provide for us a confidence, also known as faith, to carry on into today and tomorrow.\nWritten by John D. Blase\n\n                ",

Bad things seem immanent for God’s people, and like Job, Habakkuk is wondering about the justice of God. From where he is sitting, things are headed in a disastrous direction, and God does not seem to be as moved to act as Habakkuk thinks He ought to be. The wicked seem to be getting off scot-free. And the people of Judah, Habakkuk’s countrymen, are slipping into corruption. All is about to be lost. So in the first chapter of Habakkuk, the prophet asks God to give an account of Himself.\nIn today’s reading of chapter 2, Habakkuk takes a seat and waits for the Lord to answer. Before we look at God’s response, though, consider the ways in which you are sitting right next to Habakkuk, tapping your fingers on the table, waiting for God to clear His throat and apologize for failing to do the good thing that seems plainly right to you. In what areas are you trusting in your own perspective so much that when God doesn’t do what you expect, you assume the problem lies with Him?\nThe Lord responds to Habakkuk by saying that He sees everything, knows everything, and will judge everything rightly, with perfect justice, holiness, and strength. As surely as the Lord lives, “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the LORD’s glory, as the waters cover the sea” (v.14). Take some time to read this chapter slowly. Maybe even read it aloud to catch every phrase. The absolute power and assurance of God’s justice rings out with a steady, fearsome clarity. God will not be overcome. No one will thwart Him.\nI sometimes evaluate God’s performance in my life based not on what He does, but when He does it. I don’t know about you, but I’m usually in a hurry. When God doesn’t act quickly, do you wonder what’s wrong with Him?\nI take comfort in passages like this because they remind me that God is working on a larger scale than the one I see. Habakkuk’s prayer for justice was in response to the injustices he could see. His nation was falling apart, and he wanted God to patch it back together. But God’s plan to deal with the problem of injustice had an unimaginably greater reach than what Habakkuk or the people of Judah could see. God’s vision for justice and healing went beyond what they could imagine—all the way to a cross on Calvary and an empty tomb.\nWe think this world is a fragile place, that one mistake or missed opportunity could bring everything crashing down to the ground. But today we are reminded that “the LORD is in his holy temple; let the whole earth be silent in his presence” (v.20). Rest easy. God sees more than you or I can see, and He is good. All the time. He needs to give no other account of Himself than the death and resurrection of His Son. That’s enough.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Injustice is everywhere around us. Sometimes I’m overwhelmed by what I find when I scroll through my news feed: another public shooting; new abuse victims coming forward; the latest statistics on abortion or human trafficking; some public figure has used racial slurs, devaluing whole segments of the population. It feels like people invent new ways to ignore basic human dignity each day. \nThe prophet Habakkuk called it “violence”—deliberate and brutal hurt imposed on one person by another. Seeing it left him grieved, shocked, and tired. Habakkuk cried out, “How long, LORD, must I call for help?” (1:2). \nThe prophet’s words should remind us of the raw, pain-filled cries we find in the Bible’s psalms of lament (see Psalm 13:1–2; 22:1–2). The Bible doesn’t downplay this world’s brokenness. It doesn’t paint over the pain with pious words. Instead, it gives us true words that describes how we feel, allowing us to borrow these words and form them into our own desperate prayers.  \nI look at Habakkuk’s dark cry in particular as an invitation to go to God with my grief. I want to plead with Him about what I perceive to be His apathy in the face of our world of injustice. With the psalmist, I want to cry out to God: “Why do you hide and forget our affliction and oppression?” (Psalm 44:24). \nHabakkuk implores us to plead with God from our own wretched corners—but not solely from our own corners. Because these words are in the Bible, they communicate more than our own personal griefs; they also communicate the griefs of the covenant community. In fact, there may be no better way to “weep with those who weep” (Romans 12:15) than to offer prayers of lament with and for others. \nTaking our cries of indignation and doubt to God is an act of personal and corporate faith. When we go to God with our complaints, we’re acknowledging the truth that He alone can solve our problems. Sometimes we find that God answers these prayers in ways that are clear and surprising. On other occasions, our requests appear to remain unanswered. But even then there’s a great treasure in praying during times of suffering. \nOnly in the midst of our laments can we become acquainted with the God who suffered. You see, Christ joins us in our pain, and He prays with us. In our affliction, we come to know Him as the One who cried out on the cross, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” (Matthew 27:46). Though we may feel abandoned, with no understanding of why we’re suffering, we can still trust God in the midst of our pain. Our suffering is not random or cruel; it’s purposeful and redemptive.   \nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

In our modern age, we have so distanced ourselves from the reality of God and turned Him into a spiritual figment that the idea of bothering to taunt Him seems absurd. Our mockery of God comes as we passively ignore His lordship of the universe. In the Old Testament, taunting God looked entirely different.\nSecond Chronicles 32:9-22 describes the invasion of Judah by the Assyrians, who were led by Sennacherib. They surrounded Jerusalem, the holy city of Israel and the home of God’s temple. They began to taunt, but they did not merely taunt the people or King Hezekiah—they hurled insults at God. “No god of any nation or kingdom has been able to rescue his people from my power or the power of my father. How much less will your God rescue you from my power!” (2 Chronicles 32:15). And they escalated their mockery from there.\nSennacherib thought he could rattle the faith of Judah by undermining their confidence in God. He thought he could bring God’s people to their knees. Well, he was right. Hezekiah, king of Judah, did indeed fall to his knees. He prayed for deliverance, and God acted. That day, an angel of the Lord killed every Assyrian warrior and sent the shamed Sennacherib home to his own demise. Jerusalem was rescued.\nThe prophecies of Nahum, given a few years after Sennacherib’s attack on Jerusalem, speak directly to the pride of the Assyrians, specifically Nineveh. And if the people of Nineveh had any doubt about whether the God who defeated Sennacherib’s army would again act to bring this defiant city to justice, the Lord makes it perfectly clear: “I am against you. This is the declaration of the Lord of Armies” (Nahum 2:13). Nahum 2 tells of the armies of God rising up fierce and strong with blood-red shields and chariots of fire to devastate Nineveh. Chapter 3 tells of the shaming of the city for its pride, prostitution, and sorcery—all acts of defiance against God. It ends by saying the city’s people would be scattered into exile, a just retribution in line with how they had treated nations they’d once conquered.\nThese are hard verses and harsh prophecies. Our instinct might be to ignore them or explain them away, but we cannot. In these verses we see the reality of a God who will not be mocked or rejected or reviled. He is not petty or spiteful; He is perfect and glorious, making such acts infinitely condemnable. We also see a God who rescues His people, who achieves justice and doesn’t let evil stand. In God’s infinite power, holiness, justice, and kindness we find comfort. \nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Many of our spiritual struggles stem from holding wrong views of God. When we don’t see God as He is, as He has revealed Himself in Scripture, spiritual dysfunction is sure to follow. I know when I lose sight of God’s goodness and doubt His faithfulness to me, my desire to obey God plummets along with my peace and joy. \nThe spiritual dysfunction of God’s people, the Israelites, is frequently on display in the books of the Minor Prophets. The Israelites would trust and obey the Lord for a time, but then would fall headlong into rebellion and idolatry. They seemed to forget who God is and who they were as God’s people. Their struggle to remain faithful to the covenant God had made with them through Moses resulted in God sending prophets to warn them of the consequences of their disobedience. \nBut not every message from the prophets is a warning to Israel. Sometimes the prophets announce God’s blessing upon them and judgment upon their enemies. That’s what we see happening in the book of Nahum. The prophet Nahum announces God’s impending judgment upon Assyria. About 150 years prior, God relented from destroying Assyria and its capital Nineveh, much to the chagrin of the prophet Jonah. But now God’s patience has run out with this arrogant, cruel nation. Assyria’s comeuppance has finally arrived. God’s people, despite their many failings, would soon be avenged. \nThough the book of Nahum highlights God’s grace toward Israel, chapter 1 reveals much about the Lord’s character that, had the Israelites consistently believed it, they might not have drifted from Him so often. Consider the first part of verse 3: “The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will never leave the guilty unpunished.” From this verse we see that God is patient and merciful, and He is holy and just. He is a gracious God, and He is not to be trifled with.\nSeeing God as He is remains a challenge for us, too, but Jesus has made the Father known in a way the old covenant never could. God’s character is perfectly revealed in His Son, who is the “exact expression of his nature” (Hebrews 1:3). When we see Jesus in the pages of Scripture, we see the Father as well (John 14:9). Jesus corrects our faulty views of God. He is the “true light that gives light to everyone” (John 1:9). \nAs Christians we are invited to read the Minor Prophets, indeed all of Scripture, in light of the revelation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. All Scripture points to Him (John 5:39). While the prophets spoke to the issues of the day, and we should work hard to understand the original context of their words, many of their prophecies have a later, larger fulfillment as well. They point to the new covenant age and the kingdom of God inaugurated by Jesus and later to be consummated upon His return at the end of the age. These small books at the end of the Old Testament are sometimes overlooked, but they form a key chapter in God’s great story of redemption.\nWritten by Matt Erickson\n\n                ",

But God is still at work, and I am looking forward to seeing more of His promises fulfilled with my own eyes—either in the natural years that are given me to walk this earth or with eyes that are awakened from death and made new at the Lord’s coming.\nThe final words of Malachi are fitting for a faith that lives in the in-betweens. He tells the people of Judah to remember the law of Moses, those ancient rules that set Israel apart from their neighbors and were, in part, the basis for their special relationship with Him (Malachi 4:4). But He also tells them about something that will happen in the future—Elijah will come before the Day of the Lord (v.5).\n“Elijah” was John the Baptist (Matthew 11:7–10), and he did indeed prepare the way for the coming of the Lord. But there is still a future coming, a Day of the Lord that will be history’s final Day of the Lord. Whether or not Elijah will come again in some form is yet to be seen, but that the Day is coming is certain. When it does, there will be no more middles, no more alreadys-and-not-yets. There will only be judgment and salvation.\nFor those who have rejected the grace of God in Christ, the warning is dire: “all the arrogant and everyone who commits wickedness will become stubble. The coming day will consume them” (Malachi 4:1). But for those who know the Lord, Malachi has this promise: “But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings, and you will go out and playfully jump like calves from the stall” (v.2).\nThe fire of judgment or the warmth of the sun. Destruction or healing. Death or life. The choice, from Genesis to Revelation and all down through human history, has always been the same.\nWe may feel caught in the middle, but the time for remaining in the middle is drawing to a close. Let’s heed Malachi’s instruction to remember—maybe not looking back exclusively to the Mosaic Law, but to Christ, who fulfilled that law and died on our behalf. And let’s do so with thankfulness, because the work of Christ also invites us to look ahead to the promise of His coming kingdom, when all things will be made new (Revelation 21:5).\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    This past spring, when the buds started bursting, the birds started singing, and the world seemed to be reborn a thousand shades of brilliant green, I discovered that my lawn was more weeds than grass. The beautiful, vibrant, lush yard my family and I had enjoyed the previous autumn returned from its winter slumber too weak to combat a militant strain of common weeds native to Middle Tennessee.\nI called my lawn guy, and, as if it were a medical emergency, he came over to the house immediately. (I’m not joking—our lawn guy is that dedicated to grass. He loves the stuff.) Stepping from the cab of his truck, he was already shaking his head. “Winter weeds,” he said. “You can fight ‘em, but you should’ve fought ‘em last fall.” As I’m learning, one of the tricks to starting off well with grass is to apply weed killer and feed to the lawn in mid-fall, before the cooler weather sets in. Doing so prepares the yard for the coming year. Otherwise the spring rains and sunshine grow weeds faster than grass.\nIn God’s economy, preparation is a form of grace. The people of Judah, home from exile but still under the thumb of a foreign king, were awaiting the Day of the Lord, when God would reign from Jerusalem, blessing Israel and punishing the nations of the earth. The way they saw it, everyone else had it coming.\nBut that’s not the way God saw it: “I will come to you in judgment, and I will be ready to witness against sorcerers and adulterers; against those who swear falsely; against those who oppress the hired worker, the widow, and the fatherless; and against those who deny justice to the resident alien” (Malachi 3:5). God shows no favoritism when it comes to His righteousness. The people of God would be judged, just like everyone else.\nHowever, remember when I said preparation is a form of grace? Before God promised judgment, He also promised a messenger to prepare the way before the Lord (Malachi 3:1). The messenger would remind the people of God’s invitation: “‘Return to me, and I will return to you,’ says the Lord of Armies” (v.7).\nWe know this messenger as John the Baptist (see Matthew 11:10), who did indeed prepare the way for Jesus. He preached the coming kingdom of God and called the people of Israel to repent. And guess who were among Jesus’s earliest disciples? The disciples of John (John 1:35–46; 3:26–30). Their hearts were ready. Their priorities were already being aligned with the kingdom. And they paid attention to what John said about the coming Messiah, so that when the Lamb of God arrived, they were ready to follow Him.\nThere is no longer a man dressed in camel’s hair with a leather belt about his waist standing in the Jordan, his breath stinking of locusts and wild honey, calling people to repent. But that doesn’t mean we have been left without a way to prepare for the Lord’s return. We have the Scriptures and we have one another. So let us be people who savor His Word as instructions for life. Let us be people who help each other prepare our minds and hearts for the coming kingdom.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Far too many people have been there, myself included. I’m talking about that moment when you discover an invaluable covenant has been broken. Perhaps it was a marriage, a bond of friendship you thought was unbreakable, or an important business deal you were counting on.\nWhen a trust has been broken, every area of your life is affected. The worst part, though, is the burn of betrayal you feel in your gut. It’s unrelenting and unquenchable. It keeps you up at night and destroys your appetite. It’s the sort of ache that can immobilize you mentally, spiritually, and even physically if not addressed with care.\nIt may be that you, too, have been there. It may be that you’re walking through something like what I’ve described right now. If you are, I want you to know that you can go to the Lord with every bit of pain you feel, with every unanswered question, and with every doubt. He is the God of all comfort (2 Corinthians 1:3), and He is able to sympathize with us because He has been on the receiving end of betrayal as well.\nEven after God’s people had experienced the hardship of exile as a direct result of their sin, they returned to the land of promise only to slide back into disobedience once again. The priests were performing their duties without heart—offering up lame and blind animals, and defaming the reputation of God in the process. And the disdain for the Lord’s commands didn’t stop with the Levitical priesthood. Men were marrying foreign wives and worshiping their gods. Some were even divorcing the wives of their youth to do so.\nWhen I read this passage from Malachi, I expect to hear God say, “And that’s why you’re going into exile again—this time for good! I’ve had it! I can’t take it anymore!” But He doesn’t say that. Yes, He’s angry. (At one point, He even says He’s going to spread the dung of the sacrificial animals on the faces of the priests so they can be hauled out of the camp and discarded just like refuse [Malachi 2:3].) But we know this isn’t the end of Israel’s story.\nEven though there is no one who perfectly obeys the covenants and loves God with the intensity He deserves, God doesn’t give up on His people. Instead, He sends His Son to be an Israelite. Jesus becomes the perfectly obedient son of Abraham, of Jacob, of David. And He becomes the perfect priest and the perfect sacrifice, once and for all. In this way, Christ takes every broken covenant and makes them whole, perfectly fulfilling the law and completing the task Israel never could.\nWe have all broken faith. We have all been betrayers. But in Christ’s obedience, there is good news for all who are united with the Lord in His life and His death: His righteousness is now our righteousness. And though we don’t deserve it by our own merit, God is now able to look upon us and say, “He walked with me in peace and integrity and turned many from iniquity” (Malachi 2:6). Amen.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

A lot of time was spent staring at a blank document, that infernal blinking cursor mocking me as it flashed in time at the top of the page. I read and reread our passage from Malachi, praying over it and trying to think of a unique or memorable way to connect the disobedience of the priests in post-exilic Judah to our own lives today. But every parallel I could think of seemed to fall apart before my fingers could finish typing.\nThe priests in Malachi’s day were offering blind and lame animals to the Lord and treating His altar with contempt, even referring to the sacrificial system as a nuisance (Malachi 1:13). A direct comparison won’t do. We don’t bring livestock with us to church. We are not required to offer up the blood of an animal for purification. Christ’s blood has already paid the price for our sin.\nAnd it would be a stretch to compare the worship of the Old Testament sacrificial system to our modern worship services on Sunday morning, as if the lesson we should take from the Lord’s rebuke of the priests here in Malachi should be something like “Always wear your Sunday best, sing with gusto, and remember to sit up straight during the sermon.”\nIn reality, this passage is not less applicable to us because we are so far removed from its context, but ought to instead hit us powerfully in the chest. You see, in Christ, God has made us priests, and our priesthood far surpasses the Levitical priesthood of Aaron and his descendants. Scripture calls us a “royal priesthood” (1 Peter 2:9)—we are sons and daughters of the King called to serve in His presence.\nSpeaking of presence, you may have noticed there is no longer a temple in Jerusalem where God’s presence resides. Instead, God’s presence abides within every believer. We are His temple (1 Corinthians 3:16), and our priestly duties remain with us wherever we go in this world.\nJust as our priesthood and our temple-bodies are superior, so too are the sacrifices we are commanded to offer. Animals—even spotless, perfect, unblemished ones—will no longer do. Christ’s death on the cross has made them obsolete anyway. Instead, our sacrifices consist of our whole lives. Each one of us is to be “a living sacrifice” as an ongoing act of worship (Romans 12:1).\nIt would never do to take God’s rebuke of the priests in Malachi and simply apply it directly to ourselves. But there is a deep truth we need to hold onto, a glimpse into the spiritual reality we have been called into. God’s complaint was not really about blind animals. It was about the hearts of His priests. They took their sacred privileges and made them common by maintaining a posture of disrespect and dishonor toward God (Malachi 1:6). As a result, they were failing in the most sacred responsibility as God’s image-bearers: to magnify the name of the Lord. We have that same responsibility, and since our priestly role has been expanded and amplified (Revelation 5:10), we ought to read this passage as a warning.\nGod promises, “My name will be great among the nations, from the rising of the sun to its setting” (Malachi 1:11). It is for this reason we have been created, and for this reason we have been called. So in everything we do, day in and day out, give the Lord the honor due His name. We live in His presence continually, so let’s live like it, wholeheartedly devoted to Him.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

I know he doesn’t understand the weight it holds. And I know he’s just saying it because it’s a provocative word he heard his older brother use. But still, whenever I hear my two-year-old son say “I hate [fill in the blank here with anything from cereal to his fire truck pajamas to the bathtub],” it breaks my heart a little bit. Boys as young as Jude aren’t supposed to know about hate—not yet anyway.\nHate is one of those words that grabs your attention. It’s stronger than dislike, bigger than mere preference. To hate a thing is to place little or no value on it. We reserve our hatred for the worst of the worst—at least what appears to be the worst in our own eyes.\nIt’s one thing to be hated by another person, whether or not that hatred is deserved, but can there be anything worse than being the object of God’s hatred? Yet, that’s precisely what God says about Esau: “I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau” (Malachi 1:2–3). Ouch, right?\nMalachi is a book about God’s love for His people. It was written after the exile, when the people of Judah had begun to return to the land of promise. The temple had been rebuilt, but it wasn’t as awe-inspiring as the one Solomon constructed (Ezra 3:12). In addition, enemies surrounded them on every side, and they weren’t really free from the grip of foreign powers. With all this on their minds and before their eyes, the people were beginning to doubt God’s love for them.\nAnd God’s response is to point across the border of Judah into the neighboring country of Edom, where Esau’s descendants live. The Edomites haven’t been taken into exile. They haven’t suffered the losses or known the devastation that God’s people had. To any observer, based on present circumstances, it would seem that God favors Esau over Jacob. But God says that Esau’s day is coming, and when their cities are destroyed, they will not be rebuilt (Malachi 1:4). God’s people, on the other hand, had been chosen to be His vehicle of blessing for the world. He isn’t about to give them up. He loves them.\nThe use of hate in these verses catches our attention, but it shouldn’t. God’s love should instead. By all rights, God ought to hate all of us. The history of our world is a history of disobedience, of people and nations rejecting the gracious invitations of God. And Israel is, by and large, no different. That’s what the exile was all about, after all. Yet despite their sin and ours, God still chooses to love. He loved Jacob, so that through Jacob the promised Messiah would come and bless the whole world. In this way, God’s love for the people of Israel would extend to people from every tribe, tongue, and nation—even to those of us who smell an awful lot like Esau.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

Some of us want to be the king of our fantasy football league, or the king of our neighborhood’s Christmas light displays. Some of us treat the highway as our own little kingdom, demanding that our minions ask our permission before they change lanes or slow down.\nKings stand above everyone else, receiving praise and reverence from everyone around them. Nothing is withheld from kings, after all. They never come in second place, and they never have to acquiesce to another’s needs. It’s good to be king.\nIn 1 Samuel 8, Israel wants to install a king to make them like other nations. Despite God’s warnings, they were adamant: Enough with this judge stuff; give us a king! So God gave them their hearts’ desire in King Saul. For most of the monarchy, it was hit-or-miss. Most of Israel’s kings were nowhere close to David—a man after God’s own heart—but even David failed. Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and a few others had decent reigns overall. Ahaz, Manasseh, Amon, and Jehoiakim? Not so much. The people wanted a king instead of the King, and they often paid for it. Because of sin, Lord Acton’s words ring true: “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”\nAs we saw in Zechariah 13 and are reminded of here in Zechariah 14, God plans to wipe away all sin and death and injustice. And the Israelites here are promised a kingdom with God on the throne. Regardless of any king of earth that they’d look to, there would be only one King for eternity.\nRevelation 22 gives us hope in this promise: that we will be reunited with the tree of life, which our ancient parents were driven away from (Genesis 2–3). This is both a literal promise—the tree will be there, as it actually was in the garden—and a theological promise of everlasting life. The eternal kingdom will be the true and better garden of Eden. “On that day the Lord will become King over the whole earth—the Lord alone, and his name alone” (Zechariah 14:9). God’s plan of redemption never failed; indeed, God has always been working to heal His creation, erasing sin and death and all of its devastating effects. Though many kings have failed God’s people, the true King will be on His throne, and no one will ever breach His gates again.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

Except, of course, part of God making all things new means cleansing and purifying us of sin. When we read this chapter, we see a grim hope for those who turn away from God or prophesy against Him.\nBut because God is good, loving, and just, one day sin and evil and death will be no more. He will eradicate all ungodliness from creation, and we will live for eternity with Him without any fear of slipping back into sin or losing a loved one to cancer or war. The end of Revelation gives us a clear picture of this:\nThen he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will freely give to the thirsty from the spring of the water of life. The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he will be my son. But the cowards, Faithless, detestable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars—their share will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death” (Revelation 21:6–8).\nWhen thinking about Christ separating believers from unbelievers for eternity, we cannot help but think of the terrifying D-word: death. But death is inevitable, right? We often try to find a way to comfort the loved ones of the deceased. “It’s just the way it is,” we say. “It’s a part of life,” we assure them. “It’s sad, yes, but also expected; death comes for all of us.” But death is not natural—it’s actually unnatural. Sin brings death, but sin is not meant to exist. And to eliminate death, God must also eliminate sin.\nThrough Christ, we will be cleansed of all unrighteousness so that we can live forever with God, no longer worrying about sin, death, or even false prophets coming into our fold. God will bring justice, and He will fulfill His promise here in Zechariah 13—that His people will be delivered out of the fire and that He will hear their voice.\nWritten by Brandon D.

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    On a cold December day in 1944, American armed forces were surrounded in the now-famous “Battle of the Bulge.” Sensing an opportunity to force the Americans to surrender, the Germans sent a message to General Anthony McAuliffe demanding they lay down arms and give up. Encircling the cold and weary American troops who were defending the town of Bastogne, the Germans threatened total annihilation should anyone not surrender to them, assuming their own victory was imminent. Instead the Germans received an unexpected, single-word response to their presumed domination; General McAuliffe simply wrote back “NUTS!” and refused to surrender.\nThe “pronouncement” that God speaks in chapter 12 of Zechariah’s prophecy contains that kind of secure confidence. Envisioning a time when all the armies of the world would be arrayed around the holy city of Jerusalem, God declares they are no match for His strong arm.\nGod describes that day as a day when everyone will come against His people. His people will be like a heavy stone—so heavy, that when the nations try to lift it, they will end up injuring themselves (v.3). He will fight for His city by bringing the armies of His enemies into a panic (v.4). He will cause His wayward people to turn back to Him in repentance (vv.5–6). He will save and defend His people from those who came to destroy them (v.9).\nBut the means of that salvation will not be cause for a ticker-tape parade and national celebration. The pronouncement declares that the people will mourn. As the fog of war lifts and the reality of what saved them comes into view, they will “look at me whom they pierced” (v.10). Clarity comes in the Gospels when we see that our own salvation comes from the Savior’s death.\nThe future day that Zechariah proclaimed was the day when Christ would rescue His people from their sins through His own death. At the hands of His own people, Jesus laid down His life to conquer the three-fold foe of Satan, sin, and death.\nThis momentous truth brings out a response that we must embrace. As John Stott so eloquently put it, “Before we can begin to see the cross as something done for us, we have to see it as something done by us.” When we see that we have pierced the Son by our own sins, and we repent and embrace Him, we find the absolute security of God. His grace causes us to mourn, but His grace also enables us to stand in His mercy and power.\nThe cross was the definitive victory of God over all His enemies, and over the enemies of His people. There is coming a day where every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord to His glory (Philippians 2:10–11). Even though we fear that the world, the devil, and our sins will overcome us, God responds with a decisive victory in Christ. We have no reason to fear!\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Somewhere along the line, this statement was made: “People always elect the government they deserve.” It certainly rings a bell of truth. If left to ourselves, we will always put leaders in place who match and affirm our own values. Even under the authority of God, there comes a point where He turns people over to their own desires and allows them their destructive autonomy.\nThe shepherds of Israel, her leaders, were taking advantage of the people for their own power and profit (Zechariah 11:5). Instead of leading the people to God, they exploited them to achieve their own wicked ends. So God invokes Zechariah to act the part of their shepherd with two staffs in hand—one to represent the covenant, and the other, the union between Judah and Israel (v.7).\nIn a display of stubbornness, the flock reveals that the problem wasn’t simply with their leadership. The people refused to be led by anyone or anything but their own wickedness. Bad shepherds were removed, and faithful shepherds labored, but the people wouldn’t have it. They wouldn’t have the Lord lead them. Zechariah shows God’s own frustration by breaking the staffs representing God’s favor and their unity as a people (vv.10,14). Even the wages that were given to Zechariah for pastoring the people were an insult; they paid him what they would have paid a slave. The leadership of God was cheap to His people. The result was clear: God would give Israel over to “a foolish shepherd… who will not care for those who are perishing, and he will not seek the lost or heal the broken. He will not sustain the healthy, but he will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hooves” (vv.15–16).\nThis message should awaken us today; either we will humble ourselves to the voice of Jesus, the “Good Shepherd,” and follow Him, or we will refuse God’s mercy toward us and choose to follow whatever leader we want—one that will affirm and compound our waywardness. Make no mistake, there is no third way. It’s either embracing God’s grace for us in Christ and following Jesus, or rejecting God’s provision and facing the reality of being handed over to our destructive desires.\nWhile it may ring true that people always elect the government they deserve, it is the sheer grace and mercy of God that He provides a better “government” for us in Christ. Jesus, the Good Shepherd, grants eternal life to all those who humble themselves and place their trust in Him. He gives the deepest security to those who rest in His hand (John 10:28). We certainly do not deserve the gracious leadership and care of Jesus, but by God’s mercy, we don’t have to experience the curse of abusive shepherds. We are free to enjoy the delightful leadership of the only Shepherd who will lead us to green pastures of eternal life.\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    As a children’s pastor, there’s perhaps nothing that has tested my faith in God’s provision quite like recruiting volunteers. Frankly, when you’ve been told, “No,” several times over the course of a day, it can be discouraging.\nA few years ago, I participated in a conference call with a group of children’s ministry leaders in our church’s denomination. The topic of conversation was—you guessed it—recruiting teachers. The moderator asked, “What have you found to be most successful?” One leader piped up quickly, “I find the most success when I am the most passionate and prayerful.” That children’s minister emphasized the last word in his sentence, and it was convicting to me. You see, it’s not just that people are more likely to volunteer when they sense a leader’s passion. More importantly, God has designed ministry so that it only moves forward when we depend on Him—when we trust Him and pray.\nThat’s why Zecharaiah is so frustrated with Israel’s leaders. They’re bad shepherds who have led the people to trust in deceitful idols (Zechariah 10:2; see also Ezekiel 34:1–10). They’d been passionate and involved, but they hadn’t led the people to green pastures. They led them to pasturelands that were rocky and dry; they tried to feed the sheep in a desert land ruled by idols that couldn’t provide. We get the same results in our own lives when we depend on passion and effort but fail to stop and receive provision and restoration from God’s Spirit.\nThankfully, there was hope for the remnant of Israel, and there is hope for us too. We find that hope by calling upon God in prayer. Zechariah’s prophecy is a reminder that God can make even dry ground lush again:\n“Ask the Lord for rain\nin the season of spring rain.\nThe Lord makes the rain clouds,\nand he will give them showers of rain\nand crops in the field for everyone.”\n—Zechariah 10:1\nGod promised to punish Israel’s bad shepherds and restore the remnant of His people, causing them to rejoice with gladness (vv.3,6–7). God promised to strengthen them so they’d be a strong army with a brand new identity. They would live securely “in the Lord” (v.12). God provides for us as well in the name of Jesus Christ—He is our provision. He is the bread of life (John 6:22–35). Whatever discouragement you’re facing today, He is the Provider. You can depend on Him.\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    What do we want from our government leaders? What do we want from governors, kings, and presidents? Most of us have a laundry list of things we’d like to see the government do: repeal bad laws, bring justice to marginalized groups, overhaul broken programs, help the economy, provide better healthcare, lower our taxes, and so on.\nShortly after Israel returned from their captivity in Babylon, God promised to return to the land and claim it as His own (Zechariah 9:1–8). The prophet Zechariah told the people that God would give them a new government and a new King (vv.9–13), one who would make the people incredibly prosperous and bring justice and victory for Israel (vv.14–17).\nGod Himself would fight for this King until peace between Israel and the nations was finally secure. According to Zechariah, the new King would put away battle bows and war horses; there would be no more need to fight because His rule would extend from sea to sea (Zechariah 9:10). Like King David of old, the new ruler would shepherd the people like a flock of sheep (see Psalm 100:3), and they would thrive under His leadership, sparkling in the land like jewels in His hand (Zechariah 9:16–17; Isaiah 62:3).\nGod’s promises to bless the people in this passage are simply incredible. Israel certainly anticipated the new King’s rule, and the greatness and prosperity this Messiah would bring. But many in Israel—and particularly the religious leaders—rejected King Jesus when He arrived (Luke 19:39). How could this be? How did they miss the promised King?\nThey missed Him for the same reasons we sometimes miss Him today. We want the kind of prosperity that’s offered by politicians more than we want the promises of God. Sure, we want the eternal glory that God promises His people, but we don’t want the suffering that comes first. We want power and vindication, but we fail to see that God’s righteousness comes to us wrapped in weakness. King Jesus came humbly, riding on a donkey (Zechariah 9:9). He didn’t achieve the forgiveness of sins and secure salvation through military might, but rather through the blood of the covenant (v.11), His own blood that He shed for our sins when He was crucified and condemned as a criminal in our place.\nIf we want to be embraced by the best King—the one who offers us eternity—we will learn to embrace His humility ourselves (Philippians 2:5–11). King Jesus says it this way: “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me” (Luke 9:23).\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

Why do we fast and keep Christian celebrations like Easter and Christmas? Do we keep up with spiritual practices in order to earn favor from God?\nIn Zechariah 7, the people of Bethel send a delegation to the temple to seek the Lord’s favor. They ask, “Should we mourn and fast in the fifth month as we have done these many years?” (Zechariah 7:3). In essence, the people wanted to know: “What do we need to do to keep God on our side?”\nGod answered them through His prophet: “When you fasted and lamented in the fifth and in the seventh months for these seventy years, did you really fast for me? When you eat and drink, don’t you eat and drink simply for yourselves?” (7:5–6). God’s response through the prophet is meant to be a rebuke. Zechariah knows that the people are just currying favor, attempting to ingratiate themselves to God through their devout behavior.\nHow often are we just like them? We may be outwardly religious, but inwardly we’re more in love with the benefits God gives than we are in love with Him. Here’s the truth: God wants more than our personal piety. He wants our hearts.\nAs verses 7–10 make clear, God demands justice. He wants His people to treat widows, orphans, refugees, and the poor with compassion. He demands the same from us. The Bible says it again and again: “Mankind, he has told each of you what is good and what it is the Lord requires of you: to act justly, to love faithfulness, and to walk humbly with your God” (Micah 6:8). “Pure and undefiled religion before God the Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained from the world” (James 1:27).\nOf course, none of us can live up to the exacting standards of God’s justice (Zechariah 7:11–14). So, God gives the remnant of Israel a promise. He says, “I will return to Jerusalem” (8:3–8; see also Jeremiah 31:33). God tells them that He’s coming as the Savior to make them faithful and holy again.\nWe know God has come to us in Jesus Christ, so we should hear these promises as an encouragement. Christ has made us new, and He will make us fruitful (Zechariah 8:12). He’s given us His Spirit so we can love our neighbor. Let your hands be strong and build up one another. Because the Spirit dwells within us, we can practice justice and mercy. And when we do, even our fasting and feasting will be holy and joyous (v.19), not because they’re earning us favor with God. But because these religious acts now come out of the overflow of hearts that love Him.\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    By the time you get to chapter 5 of Zechariah, you have at least half a dozen visions, and almost all of them are more than a little odd. But arguably, the strangest of all may start here, where we see something is “going out.” We are told it is a basket, and that in the basket is the “iniquity of the land,” which sounds like great news. Then we find out there is a woman in the basket—and she is wickedness personified.\n“Then the angel who talked with me came forward and said to me, \n‘Lift your eyes and see what this is that is going out.’ And I said, ‘What is it?’\nHe said, ‘This is the basket that is going out.’ And he said, \n‘This is their iniquity in all the land’” (Zechariah 5:5–6, ESV).\nSpeaking of odd, the first thing I thought of when I read those verses was Bruce Springsteen. The other day, my ten-year-old son asked me, “Why do you like Bruce Springsteen so much?” I gave a quick answer of, “Well, I’ve been listening to him ever since I was about your age.” And while that’s true, the more I’ve thought about it, I think the real answer is empathy; I keep listening to him because of his ability to empathize with other human beings.\nSpringsteen’s songs are full of empathy. Sometimes I understand all too well the joys and the heartbreaks he sings about. Other times, I understand other people better—their joys, heartaches, and failures—because of his songs. And sometimes I understand their sins better too.\nOne of his songs that is full of empathy and never ceases to move me is “Racing in the Street.” It’s told from the perspective of an aging man who goes to work every day, and in an attempt to recapture the glory of his youth, he participates in street races. This is what he lives for. His wife is also aging and is disappointed with the life they have. You can gather from reading between the lines that these are not wealthy people by a long shot.\nIt’s a powerful tune full of regret, grit, and resolve. And it was the first thing I thought of when I read Zechariah 5:5–6. I thought of that song because of the last couple of lines: “Tonight, my baby and me, we’re gonna ride to the sea / And wash these sins off our hands.”\nWithin all of us, we know something is not right and needs to be fixed. Actually, we know there are sins that need to be removed. And we know something bigger than ourselves (and the sea) is needed to do it.\nMy first thought was that line from Springsteen. But my second thought was of Jesus. Because we cannot wash the sins from our hands, it is nothing but a relief for us to know He washes us clean through His work on the cross. All of us will have times of feeling like we need to clean ourselves up and wash away our sin, guilt, and shame. That is when we need to remember our iniquity has already been removed from us.\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In Brandon Sanderson’s fantasy novel, The Way of Kings, the high prince Dalinar discovers a long lost teaching called “The Immortal Words” in an ancient text. Within it are a set of ideals for living and an honor code for a group of ancient warriors: Strength before weakness. Life before death. Journey before destination.\nAlmost everyone around Dalinar thinks he is crazy for trying to live by these ideals, especially in the midst of war. He trusts that these ideals are from “the Almighty” and that living by them honors both the Almighty and those under his command, men and women he has sworn to protect, and his enemies.\nI found all three of these teachings fascinating. But the last one has kept my attention for weeks now: journey before destination. At the same time, a slave named Kaladin is also learning this ideal from another slave; it’s explained to him in this way: “There are always several ways to achieve a goal. Failure is preferable to winning through unjust means… In the end, all men die. How you lived will be far more important to the Almighty than what you accomplished.” In other words, the ends don’t justify the means. How you get something done is just as important—if not more important—than what you get done.\nWhen God speaks through Zechariah to Zerubbabel about the rebuilding of the temple, He makes sure he knows it will not be easy. But then He says something very interesting: “Not by strength or by might, but by my Spirit” (Zechariah 4:6). God wants to make it clear that as important as the rebuilding of the temple is, how it is completed is also important. And while they will have to work hard to rebuild it, it will be done by the power of the Spirit.\nI know this would’ve been hard for me to buy into, because it’s hard for me to buy into now. I want to muster up my own power and strength when something needs to get done. I’ve been thinking about all of this because I want my family to be a family that honors God, one another, and everyone we meet. But my temptation is to want this Christian ideal—this destination—without the Christian journey. I rely on rules and my ability to exert power and control over people and situations. My temptation is to not trust the power of prayer or the power of God’s Word to mold us into the family God would have us be. But think about it: If we want our families and ourselves to be molded into the image of Christ, then we must trust that His Spirit can do the work far better than we ever could in our own power.\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Have you ever started a project but didn’t see it to completion? Perhaps it was the renovation of a bathroom? Or maybe you bought an old car and swore you would fix it up? Or you bought a copy of War and Peace that now sits collecting dust on the shelf?\nMaybe it was outside forces that stopped you midway through—difficulties that made finishing seem insurmountable. Maybe you just lost the desire to keep working. Maybe, like me, you just lost the fire to keep going.\nMy project was for our family to work through an overview of the entire biblical story over a few months at the dinner table. We got through Moses, but busy school nights and lagging interest did us in. And I honestly just lost the desire to keep going when the enthusiasm waned.\nZechariah wrote the first part of his book a few decades after the first group of Jewish exiles had returned from Babylon. They had begun the work of building the temple, but that work had begun to wane. The enthusiasm God’s people had after their initial return from exile had all but disappeared. So God speaks to the prophet Zechariah and His first words to him are bone chilling: “The Lord was extremely angry with your ancestors” (Zechariah 1:2). In other words, “You need to remember why you ended up in Babylon, with a destroyed temple.”\nBut His next words for His people are a kind invitation: “Return to me… and I will return to you” (v.3). It’s a plea, asking them to not be like their forefathers, who also asked to turn away from sin and to Him instead. They did not listen. Thankfully, this time God’s people respond in repentance.\nNot long ago I was talking to my class of eighth grade students about repentance, and when I asked them to define it, they told me it was being sorry for what you have done. “That’s true,” I told them. But there is more.\nWhen I was a kid, my fourth grade Sunday school teacher once told us repentance was like a soldier marching in one direction and then turning and going in the opposite direction. It’s doing a one-eighty, an about-face. So when the Israelites repented, they were not only sorry; they actually began to do what they were supposed to do.\nRepentance is hard. It’s hard to hear that you’ve done wrong, that you’ve sinned and need to change. It is hard because there are always forces working against us. And it is hard because the very sin problem that caused the need for repentance is still with us as we move forward.\nThe whole time I was reading this story, I thought about the temple that we, all of mankind, tore down and God rebuilt—Jesus. Repentance is hard, but looking back to that story and what God has done to deliver us can ignite a fire of enthusiasm within us to pursue the work of His kingdom.\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

To pacify jealous leaders, the sinless God-man was put to death in the fashion of traitors and rebels. He was displayed like a bloody yard sale sign for all passersby to see and to scorn.\nThat is one side to this story, the unjust and bloody murder of the Messiah.\nThere is another side woven throughout the same events, the side of signs, wonders, and hope. In the face of questioning and mockery, Jesus remained silent, like a sheep being peacefully led to slaughter. The purple robe, crown of thorns, and placard declaring Him to be “King of the Jews”—all of these details were meant to demean Him but were infinitely more accurate than His accusers knew. \nWith His final words, Jesus referred to Psalm 22, which speaks of being forsaken by God, but also of His rescue and good pleasure in doing so. Just as He gave up His spirit as a willing sacrifice, darkness fell at midday, displaying the Father’s sorrow. In that moment, the rending of the temple curtain made the holiest place accessible to all. Somehow, in the midst of the blood and gore and screams and agony, a Roman centurion saw the signs and recognized the truth: “Surely this man was the Son of God” (Matthew 27:54). And so He was.\nAnd so He is. \nJust as the Son of God gave up His spirit, He then took it back again, rising from the dead, resurrected. With an earthquake and angelic entourage, Jesus exited the grave. He greeted friends, spoke tenderly to the doubting, made public appearances to hundreds, and gave life to the tales His murderers sought to spread. He left witnesses in His wake and left them with a charge: go and make disciples. And then He left them with a promise, saying, “I will be with you always, even to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:19-20). \nWhen Jesus departed earth, He had fulfilled His mission: to live a perfect life as one both completely divine and completely human; to die the death He alone did not deserve in order to give salvation to all those who did; and to bring about the death of death with His own resurrection. He then established His church by commissioning His followers to be disciple-makers, promising to impart the Holy Spirit to them as teacher, guide, empowerer, and life-giver. \nIndeed, this man was, and is, the Son of God. And one day, He will come again.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

I can think of a handful of difficult conversations in my life that I would have preferred to avoid completely, if at all possible. Yet, if we are honest with ourselves, it is often the most difficult of life’s circumstances that, when looked back upon, appear to have had the most lasting, transformative impact on our lives or the lives of others. \nNo one has felt this feeling of foreboding conflict and pain like Christ.\nAs He approached His death, Jesus was overcome by the grim reality of what was to come. He would be betrayed, sold into the hands of His enemies, and killed—separated from God the Father for the good of His children. Even knowing there would be light on the other side of the darkness, Jesus’ trust in the will of the Father was pushed to the brink.\nIn the Garden of Gethsemane, not far away from where He would be crucified the next day, Jesus prayed to the Father, saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will” (Matthew 26:39).\nJesus did not fear death. He was not trying to back out of the impending physical pain, as horrible as it was going to be. Jesus was facing the reality that His Father was about to forsake Him. The Father does not forsake even the vilest of sinners who repents. Yet, He was about to forsake His own Son.\nBut Jesus, as soon as He asked that the cup of God’s wrath pass from Him if possible, said He knew He must yield to the will of God the Father and endure all that was to come.\nIt would be easy to look at this passage and ask the questions, “What is it that you need to endure from God on behalf of others? What conflict do you need to face for the sake of those you love?” But such an application is short-sighted. \nWhen we witness the courageous, life-giving embrace of imminent death by our Savior, the most appropriate response is not for us to try to emulate this sacrificial act, but to praise Him for it. We must look to Christ as our hope; as the one who gave up His unity with the Father so that we, too, might experience such unity with Him ourselves.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    All of my brothers are significantly older than me. The brother closest in age is nine years older, and the oldest is about thirteen years older than I am. At family reunions, my kids are playmates with their grandkids. When I was my youngest son’s age, my brothers were either in college or about to finish college. It was like having four dads or three extra uncles who were only around sometimes. The one time of year I always got to spend with them was around the holidays. Even if they were in college or grad school they would come home for a couple of weeks. I loved those times.\nMy brother Wes was a genius. He made incredible grades in high school and college. Because of this, he was accepted to Georgetown Law School in Washington, D.C. While I loved going to visit and getting familiar with the nation’s capital, I missed having him around. He’d stayed home during his years as an undergrad, so throughout those four years I was able to pester him and do everything I could to get his attention. But now he was states away and his visits home were few and far between.\nBut he always came home for the holidays.\nThere were no cell phones back then, so the timing of his exact arrival was always a mystery. But I would wait for hours. Our house sat on the side of a small mountain, and when you were on the second floor of the house, the street below seemed far away. I loved sitting in the living room at Christmas and listening to my dad’s Christmas mix tapes. There was something about the colors of those lights on the tree and the lights on the street below that carried Wes and other family members home. \nI knew he was coming. He had told us. I just had no idea when exactly he would show up. \nThere is a lot to this being ready when Jesus comes. But when He says to “be alert,” we know one thing for sure: Part of watching for Him is wanting Him to come. When I watched for my brother to show up at Christmas, I was anxious for him to come home. I wanted his presence in our home. When we keep an eye on Jesus’ return, we look forward to His return. We are not wanting Him to delay. \nThat’s not always easy when things are going well. When the wedding bells are chiming and the money is coming in and the children are being born and the pantries are full to overflowing—that’s when it’s hard to watch for Jesus’ coming. But watch we must. \nBecause of who He is and what He has done for us, we ought to prize Christ’s presence more than all the good things in our lives that He has given to us. We must long for Him to come and then rejoice when He does— just as a young boy waits for his brother, knowing the things of this world do not shine as brightly as his presence.\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

Gawking over the clothes of celebrities, movie stars, and millionaires is a low point of television’s year. Success isn’t on that carpet. Greatness isn’t found in the glamor of the world. Jesus would tell us to look past the people in the flashing lights and to look for the people who rolled that carpet out; find the people who are picking up the trash, opening doors, and serving others—there you’ll find a shadow of kingdom greatness.\nBrothers, do we fall for the same trap in our churches and in our inner lives? Do we think greatness is found in being at the top of the pyramid or being the person in the room everyone looks to—the kind of person everyone oohs and aahs over? \nJesus reminds us that greatness isn’t found in a title. Rabbi, teacher, pastor, doctor, CEO, head of the house—our crucified Savior smashes all the pomp the world finds in titles. On the cross, literally nailed above our nailed Lord, were titles mocking Him. Yet even in the midst of being mocked with those titles, true greatness and compassion remained as Jesus served us to the point of death on that cross.\nIf you want to be great, you won’t be. If you want to serve, you will be. Servanthood isn’t a back alley to greatness. We don’t serve, waiting for the eventual boomerang of greatness to be bestowed upon us. It doesn’t work that way. If you chase greatness and superiority you will only achieve great hypocrisy. Serving from the heart, for the good of others, is the true greatness of the gospel of the kingdom.\nJesus says the greatest among us are the servants. His cross and resurrection prove it. He didn’t come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many (Matthew 20:28)—for you and for those whom you serve. \nIf you crave a red carpet for your life, don’t crave one to walk on, but one to roll out for your wife, your kids, your friends, and coworkers. Serve as you’ve been served by your servant-hearted Savior. Greatness is there with Him and from Him.\n Written by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I recently presided over the graveside service of the father of one of the members of my congregation. The day before, two sons of the deceased man had come to the beautiful country cemetery to dig their own father’s grave. Allow that to set in for a moment.\nIt was at the end of the service that I was no longer able to hold back my tears. Family and friends all stood in silence as these two brothers lowered the urn of their father’s remains into the earth and slowly covered it with dirt, shovelful after shovelful. What a profound ritual of remembrance. What a powerful reminder of the brevity of life on this earth.\nBefore I left, I prayed that my words during the service would comfort them as they faced the harsh reality of his death. The good news: this was not goodbye; it was “see you soon.” \nIt is in this passage from Matthew 22 that Jesus challenges the Sadducees, the religious teachers of the day, in their limited understanding of life beyond this world. Quoting Exodus 3:6, Jesus says, “Now concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read what was spoken to you by God: ‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living” (vv. :31-32).\nJesus called forth this poignant passage, one the religious leaders would have been familiar with, for a reason. When these words were written in Exodus, the men mentioned had been dead for centuries; however, it was written in present tense. Why did the writer of Exodus refer to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as living?\nYou see, Jesus was pointing the Sadducees to God’s power to raise not only the patriarchs, but also all of God’s people to enjoy His eternal covenant in the world to come—an eternal life beyond anything they could imagine by comparison to life in this world.\nAs Christians, we understand that when Christ sat down at the right hand of the Father following His death, resurrection, and ascension, it was a declaration that His work was finished (Hebrews 10:12-13; Psalm 110:1). Sin and death had been defeated. Death no longer has the last word. For all believers, there is an Easter morning to come.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When we read Scripture, we’ll notice many different ways Jesus is described. Some have to do with His nature (who He is), and some have to do with His ministry (what He does). To understand the depth of Jesus’ life and ministry, we have to understand many things about Him. We have to understand that He is fully God and yet fully man; He is the God who can forgive sins, and the man who shed His blood to cover them. He is a priest, standing as mediator between God the Father and His sinful people. He is also a prophet, who speaks on behalf of God and embodies His message of both grace and judgment. And in today’s reading, we see that Jesus is also a king.\nHe is not king in the way the people laying down their palms and coats might have imagined—a political hero or a military leader. But make no mistake: He is King.\nNow, when we think of kings, we often think of corrupt leaders. We tend to be wary of power because, as Lord Acton said, “absolute power corrupts absolutely.” There is no such thing as a perfect earthly king or ruler, president or prime minister. In our passage today, Jesus is mentioned in the same breath as King David. We all know the faults of David, most notably that he was a murderer and adulterer. Even so, in all his imperfection, he was a man “after God’s own heart,” whose bloodline would one day produce the True King (1 Samuel 13:14; 2 Samuel 7). David wasn’t perfect, but God would send a perfect King from David’s family line.\nKing Jesus is the King who can never be corrupted, because He is the only man who lived and died without sin (2 Corinthians 5:21). While other kings barter over possessions and land and military might, our King owns all things and is eternally undefeated. Even His death on a cross was not a defeat, but a cosmic victory over His greatest enemies: sin and death (1 Corinthians 15:57).\nOur passage today reminds us that Jesus is the rightful King of the world and of our hearts. He does not make deals with the devil, but rather stomps his head (Genesis 3:15; Matthew 4:1-11). Praise God that King Jesus is not only a powerful and perfect ruler, but also a kind and humble King who invites His children to come to Him. May we, with childlike faith, embrace our King, trusting Him to grant us His life-giving grace and protect us from life-stealing sin.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I honestly believe that if we are not thrown by what Christ says, we probably haven’t heard Him correctly. Jesus’ words continue to baffle those who hear them. Even His disciples, who walked with Him daily, kept double-checking to be sure they’d understood Him correctly. And when He addressed the issues of divorce and marriage, His disciples simply reasoned, “If the relationship of a man with his wife is like this, it’s better not to marry” (Matthew 19:10).\nIf we hear Jesus correctly, we are right there with the disciples, scratching our heads, and doing our best to understand it all. When He speaks of camels passing through needles, they respond: “Then who can be saved?” (Matthew 19:23-25). Who indeed? Who can live in the economy of God’s kingdom? No one, according to his own works. With man, it is impossible, but with God, all things are possible (v. 26). \nWe are both legalists and antinomians at heart; we think of the law as a means of earning favor, salvation, and glory, yet we also think of the law in the loosest terms possible. Like the men in the vineyard, we are incensed when we don’t get paid bonuses, despite the fact that we’ve received our just wages (Matthew 20:1-15). Like the rich man, we’ve kept our own version of the law and are disappointed to find that it is not enough (19:16-22). Like the Zebedees, we think we can drink the cup, and we’d like to get a few thrones thrown in just to make things fair. And if someone else seems to beat us to it, we are indignant (20:20-24). \nMankind has always been angling for first place, failing to recognize that God’s economy works very differently. But many who are first will be last, and the last first (Matthew 20:16). To inherit the kingdom, we ought to come to Him as children, that He may lay His hands on us and pray (Matthew 19:13-15). May we come to Him as the blind men, saying “Lord, have mercy on us… Open our eyes!”  (Matthew 20:30, 34). \nLet us lay aside our anglings and barterings, the clamoring for first place, lording what authority we have over those in our care. Yes, left to ourselves and in our own strength, this is impossible, but with God all things are possible. For, “the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many” (Matthew 20:28). In His kingdom, great and small are overturned, as He simply calls us to Himself, saying, “Come, follow me.”\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Have you ever been frustrated when a writer or film director does something that seems outside the expected or conventional lines of a story? Recent backlash over the film Star Wars: The Last Jedi is evidence of that very kind of frustration. Some faithful fans have expressed their disappointment and even disgust with the plot twists director Rian Johnson made. The Star Wars-obsessed had trouble allowing their predictable plot lines to be altered in a new creative direction. No longer could the audience say to themselves, I know where this is going…  \nThe problem is we often think that way about Jesus too. Even Jesus’ closest disciples did. As our passage today points out, Peter thought he had it down when it came to the plot line of Jesus. As he stood with James and John on the mountain and Jesus revealed His full and radiant glory to them, it seemed this was the moment Peter had been expecting: Now the Kingdom has come! Now Rome will be overthrown!\nEven the appearance of Moses and Elijah confirmed Peter’s perceived familiarity with the trajectory of Jesus’ story. As the glory mounted, he proposed the opportunity to harness the moment, saying,  “Lord, it’s good for us to be here. I will set up three shelters here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah” (Matthew 17:4). Looking to establish a way to memorialize, and perhaps even monetize, God’s power and glory, Peter believed he had it all figured out about Jesus.\nIs that the case with you too? Does Jesus fit into the nice and tidy box that you have built around your behaviors, politics, and religious expectations? It’s possible that when we really see who Jesus is, we will be frustrated that He doesn’t fit our perceived patterns of who He should be. \nGod’s interruption of Peter is the exact remedy we need in those moments. As the glory of Christ was placed on full display, the Father broke into the story, which forces us to evaluate what kind of relationship we possess with Him. Jesus isn’t one we can manipulate into bringing about our best life now. Instead, the Father declares Jesus to be His beloved Son to whom we are obligated to listen. The familiar line we expect is that Jesus is obligated to us; the plot twist is that we are commanded to listen to Him. \nMaybe this is why Jesus is frustrating to many; He doesn’t fit the tropes we’ve constructed for Him. When we come face to face with who He really is, sometimes we’d rather listen to ourselves. Yet, for those who will abandon their own storylines and desires to manipulate Jesus, they will hear Jesus say, “Do not be afraid.” That’s the power and glory He came to show.\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

But social media has captured the word and diluted it with a swift terribleness. For many in our current culture, to be a follower means nothing more than loosely keeping track of someone online whom you may or may not know in person, and if you do know them, it’s often by way of a mutual friend. There is little to any actual commitment to that person other than clicking the “follow” or “like” buttons and then, on occasion and only if the mood strikes, commenting with an emoji in response to words or images that person posted. These days following is, as they say, “easy peasy.”\nJesus the Messiah was accused of many things in His day, but being indirect was usually not one of the charges. If anything, His approach may have seemed too direct, too piercing, or at least more so than His contemporaries would’ve preferred. The Gospel according to Matthew records Jesus’ straightforward, but rather un-easy-peasy, conditions when it comes to following:  \n“If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me” (Matthew 16:24).\nThis is a good example of the danger of sidestepping the truth of Scripture in an attempt to remake Jesus in our own image. We must let Jesus be Jesus. If we’re not careful, we’ll paint Jesus as a consensus-seeking savior, always content to hear every opinion around the table, and then in conclusion, to encourage some variation on a theme of “Can’t we all just get along?” But hold on. That is not Jesus—certainly not Jesus the Messiah we find in Matthew’s words. \nThe truth here is clear, stabbing, and let’s face it, possibly more than we would prefer. There is a cost involved with being a follower of Jesus. It requires a self-denial that rings strange in our postmodern ears, and a level of commitment that rubs our progressive wills the wrong way. It means surrendering to the reality that, as one pastor paraphrased: “We are not in the driver’s seat. Jesus is.” The faded bumper sticker you may see from time to time reads: “God is my co-pilot.” No, no He’s not. And if He is, you can call yourself something—just not a follower.       \nFollower. According to Jesus the Messiah’s definition, this means choosing to be, as they say, all in. Anything less is simply about liking Jesus. What the Messiah calls for is our love.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

As Mr. Smith sprays bullets toward him, Neo raises his hand, causing the bullets to stop mid-air and harmlessly drop to the floor. Remember that scene—when Neo realizes he is “The One”? After the bullets fall, Neo flexes his arms, and when he does, it’s as if the walls surrounding him and the rest of the world flex with him. It’s an exhilarating scene because it marks the moment when evil realizes it is no match for good. \nIn today’s reading, Jesus walks on water. This may be one of the most well-known details of Jesus’ life, but when we look at the text, we see that those who are close to Him do not respond with a cheer. They are afraid. Why? Because Jesus is flexing and the world is flexing with Him. His disciples are beginning to wonder if they have a tiger by the tail; if they let go, there’s no telling what may happen.\nPerhaps one of the most accurate words we could use to describe Jesus during the Galilee phase of His earthly ministry, is “famous.” Though the time was coming when the world would turn on Him with a vengeance, in these early chapters of Matthew’s Gospel, everyone seems to want a piece of Him. When He opens His mouth to teach, great crowds gather. When word spreads that He is close to a town, the sick, lame, and blind are brought for healing. When He goes to the synagogue to teach, religious leaders square up for debate as though they are facing a worthy opponent. \nBut as we know well in our own culture, being famous is not the same as being known. Most people who admired Jesus in this stage of His earthly ministry admired Him for who they thought He was, not for who He truly was. We all do this to one degree or another. Even John the Baptist, who came out of the womb with a call to prepare the way for Jesus’ life of ministry, wondered if Jesus really was the Messiah (Matthew 11:1-19).\nOne reason I love the story of Jesus walking on the water is because of how it terrifies those who see Him. Surely if any of us saw Jesus flex like this, if we saw His full glory and power on display, we’d be terrified too. Why? Because the power of Jesus is greater than any of us can imagine.\nThe Apostle Paul says in Philippians 2 that every knee will bow before Jesus, and every tongue will confess that He is Lord (vv. 10-11). He has this sort of power and glory. But just as He invited Peter out onto the water, He invites us to draw near to Him in all His glory and power. We draw near by faith, knowing He will not use His power to crush us, but to save us. Still, it is good for us to remember that His power remains greater than we can imagine.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

As parents naturally do, I was using an example to make a point about an attitude she needed to change. It was concrete, clear, and drew out the truth I was seeking to make obvious to her. Needless to say, it fell on deaf ears. \nYou might say she did not have ears to hear. (You might also note that I am not Jesus and don’t have His perfect communication skills.) She heard me, she understood my words, yet the meaning did not penetrate her heart. \nJesus navigated this very matter at a more profound level, an eternal life-and-death level. He spoke life-saving truths in parables, veiled stories packed with meaning. But only some people could pull back the veil to access the meaning with clarity—those with “ears to hear.” To some, Jesus said, the secrets of the kingdom had been revealed, and for them parables were clear and crystalline, solid and sharp. For everyone else, they were a fog of words swirling around the truth, keeping it from being clearly seen and understood.\nWhen Jesus spoke of good soil, mustard seeds, wheat and weeds, and leaven, He was using familiar objects and actions to give imagery to spiritual realities. Like an optical illusion, His words were lost on many listeners. But for those who were willing to hear, Jesus would explain His parables. \nWhy didn’t He explain them for everyone? Why not just speak in plain language to begin with? Because Jesus was calling hearts, not arguing with minds. He spoke to the ears of the heart, and if those ears could hear Him, then the heart would follow Him. Those with ears to hear were the good soil in which the Word could spring up, grow, and bear fruit. Their fruit was like a mustard seed of faith that started small and would become a great plant.\nSo often we read Scripture and see the words of Jesus. We hear sermons and lessons. We read books and receive teaching. Our minds absorb it and parse it out. Our intellects are stimulated as we put together ideas and arguments. But are we good soil? Is the seed of the Word planted and bearing the fruit of faith? We hear, but do we listen? For that is how we truly know Jesus and enter into His kingdom.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    For thousands of years, and even today, controversy and confusion surround the matter of the Sabbath. Should the day of rest be Saturday or Sunday? Are we allowed to do anything on the Sabbath, or is the point to just avoid work? And why can’t Chick-fil-A be open all the time? \nRegardless of what we believe about the Sabbath, we know two things to be true: we need rest, and Jesus is our ultimate rest. Currently, I have been working for about twelve days straight, so I am experiencing the practical need for a day of rest in my life right now. At the same time, I know that it is in Jesus alone that I find true Sabbath rest.\nIn Matthew 12, Jesus is confronted with the legalism of the Pharisees who seek to prosecute Him for not adhering to the culturally appropriate ways of observing the Sabbath in His day. Jesus responds by telling the Pharisees and others listening that “the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath” (v. 8). Meaning, the religious ordinances and rules erected by the Pharisees in an attempt to worship Yahweh, yield to the authority of the Son of Man, who is Jesus.\nThe Pharisees misunderstood the Sabbath. They understood it to be a day in which they rested, but they executed it as a sort of worshipful mimicry of how God rested after He created the earth. This was a partial, and therefore incorrect, view of the Sabbath.\nJesus came to tell them that the Sabbath is more than a day. It is a person. It is Jesus Himself. And it is in Him that we find true rest, not in a day defined by ritualistic relaxation. Indeed, one day, as Matthew said in recounting Jesus’ confrontation with the Pharisees, “The nations will put their hope in his name” (Matthew 12:21; Isaiah 42:1-4).\nTaking a day of our week to rest from work and the routine stressors of life is wise, no matter what day of the week it is. But we rob ourselves of true rest if we simply understand the Sabbath to be a license to be lazy one day out of every seven. \nTo experience true Sabbath rest, we must rest in the finished work of Jesus. He is the only One in whom we can find true rest, because His work is the only work which is actually finished. Might we, the nations, put our hope in the name of the One who purchased eternal rest on our behalf.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

Or the verse lived inside me.\nMonday through Friday I would drive begrudgingly to the office. I would park the truck as far from the building as possible, walk through the parking lot, use my badge to get into the building, wait for the elevator, and then clock in. And Monday through Friday I would work hard, clock out with a sigh, wait for the elevator, use my badge to leave the building, walk across the parking lot, and drive home miserably, knowing I would get up the next morning and do it all over again. \nAnd this verse from Matthew 11 would swirl inside my head.\nI know what this verse is about. It’s not about the rest that I longed for, from a job I was ill-fitted for in the business world. This verse is not about the weariness I am experiencing now while working at a school doing something I love. Yes, that is God-given rest, but this is not the rest Jesus was offering. They are related, though. \nYou see, while I was working in that awful place, I would often doubt God’s affection for me. There was an intellectual compartment in which I stored all the knowledge of God’s justifying grace and love toward me, regardless of my attitude and sin. I could teach it to a Sunday school class. I could counsel friends about it. But buying in while sitting at my desk was proving elusive. Doubt would creep in, riding on the wings of emotional reactions to stress and the hardship of work I had to do and could not seem to escape.\nLet me tell you if you don’t already know: misery in your work, coupled with guilt over that misery, is a deadly mix. Guilt because you have a job and you hate it. Guilt over not doing a good job at work because you just don’t care. Guilt because God has given you so many other good things. It wears you down. It crowds out hope, and you have trouble enjoying even the smallest things.\nI just wanted some rest. And Jesus offered it. \nWhen in the midst of all the stress and frustration, I would sometimes remember the gospel message of Christ’s work on my behalf. I’d remember that He did all the heavy lifting—actually, He did all the lifting, period. Regardless of how my day went and how frustrated I was, I could rest in the knowledge that God the Father loved me because of what God the Son did for me. \nAnd here’s the kicker. One day, we will not only rest in the work of Christ, but we will rest from all the weariness of this world. We need to go to Jesus with our need for rest from trying to work ourselves into God’s good graces. That is good news. In a world that offers work, Jesus offers rest for our weariness.\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I remember roughly two to three handfuls of stuff from high school, and somehow, a lesson from Basic Economics made the cut. Here it is: There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Everything costs something. Sure, you may be getting a free bowl of chili, but it cost someone to make it. They bought the food, used labor hours to prepare it, bought bowls, utensils, and on and on. Something may appear free to you, but it was costly for someone else. \nAnd this is Jesus’ point too.\nJesus sends His band of brothers out, reminding them what they paid to become His disciples: absolutely nothing. They didn’t earn it. They weren’t selected because of their prestige, influence, or liquid cash to make things happen. They didn’t pay a premium to get in the room with Jesus. The Twelve freely received the message of the kingdom. Their discipleship with Jesus was free of charge. Jesus now tells them as they go forth proclaiming the kingdom, to not do it for the coin. “Don’t acquire gold, silver, or copper for your money-belts” (Matthew 10:9). Freely they received, so they should freely give, expecting nothing in return.\nJesus operates on the currency of grace with His people, and this is to be our currency with others too. There is no fitting exchange rate for grace. Once we try to exchange grace for something else—swap it out for works, mere morality, or self-righteousness—we get zero back. The entire Christian life, beginning to end, is from this reality: “For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift” (Ephesians 2:8). \nBrothers, we’ve freely received, so we freely give. We’ve been forgiven, so we forgive. We’ve been loved, so we love. The message of grace came to us, so we can give it to others. Jesus wants us function and serve from a place of grace, freely given to us by Him. \nRemember, there is no such thing as a free lunch. It will cost you to give to others. Maybe you’ll have to spend money to help someone who is down. Perhaps you’ll spend time over lunch evangelizing. Or maybe you’ll rack up weekends serving in a prison or a pregnancy center. But these operating costs are joyfully spent because the kingdom is worth it. Jesus is worth it. It cost Jesus His blood—His very life—to free us from our sins and give us new life. We did nothing but believe. \nAnd today, the risen Jesus invites us to freely give as we’ve freely received, to share a no-strings-attached gospel. To serve as you’ve been served by Jesus. In your day-to-day, invite others in to the experience of freely receiving the grace of Christ through you from Him.\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

We have all felt the painful feeling of shame arising from the consciousness of something dishonorable or impure. Shame causes us to pull away from others. It is impossible to estimate how much time and energy people invest in trying to hide or deny the things they are ashamed of.\nThis is why the woman who rudely breaks into the account of Matthew 9 is so intriguing. According to medical and social norms of the time, she was beyond unclean. She was the carrier of an unspeakable bloody discharge. And yet she pushes through the crowd. Does she have no shame?\nIn the ancient Near East, most people would have gone to great lengths to avoid unnecessarily exposing themselves to her. Yet here she is, moving through a large crowd in pursuit of Jesus. Doesn’t she know that, according to Old Testament law, she could infect other people with her impurity?\nSo what is more powerful than her shame? What causes her to go public and push through the crowd in order to grasp the edge of Jesus’ robe?\nDesperation.\nDesperation may be the only thing more powerful than shame. It is the woman’s desperation that causes her to expose her dishonor and impurity with the hope that she will be made clean.\nAnd Jesus responds unexpectedly. He doesn’t pull away from her in disgust; He accepts her in love. When this woman touches the hem of His garment, Jesus turns to her and refers to her as His “daughter.” With great affection, He welcomes her as a dependent.\nIsn’t this amazing? Jesus was unashamed to be identified with her uncleanliness. “‘Have courage, daughter,’ He said. ‘Your faith has saved you’” (Matthew 9:22).\nThis should not surprise us. After all, this is the same Jesus who came to embrace all of humanity’s  uncleanliness and shame on the cross. This is the same Jesus who would pour out His own blood to make us clean. This friends, is the good news of the gospel. Christ tells us not to cover our shame, but bring it to Him. When we confess our shame, Jesus covers it for us, making us clean before the only audience that matters: our Holy God. Therefore, don’t pull away from Christ—run to Him in desperation. He is the only one who can rid you of your shame.\n Written by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

For eight weeks, it feels like you spend more time in your closet or bathtub than anywhere else in the house. For my family, our fear of these uncontrollable storms was always at red alert. Our area wasn’t just at risk for the occasional twister; we lived where many of those tornadoes tended to start. We were often glued to The Weather Channel, sure that our day was (eventually) going to come.\nI’d like to say that we always prayed and trusted the Lord in those moments. Truthfully, we didn’t. We treated tornadoes like embodied deities, almost bowing down to them and begging them not to hit our house. C’mon, tornado. Stay north of us. Don’t come through here, we prayed from our closet. We stopped just short of leaving them an offering on our doorstep.\nMuch like the disciples on the boat, we had doubts. When the storms raged around us, we said, “Lord we’re going to die!” We wish we were more like so many of those in today’s passage who turned to Jesus, with faith that he could heal and protect. In fact, we have even less excuse than the disciples to doubt Jesus’ power, because we get to look back on these stories and see the Savior at work.\nIf we believe the Bible is true, then we’ll ultimately rest in the truth that Jesus is in the business of healing and protecting. Storms, diseases, and frailties are like house flies in the face of Jesus—they are annoying, but of no real threat. He squashes them with a mere word. After all, “even the wind and sea obey him” (Matthew 8:27). Surely, even our greatest heartaches, missteps, and fears are no match for Him. \nToday, may we trust that even through life’s storms and pains, Jesus is here. He cares. He empathizes. He reaches out to us. He may not always answer exactly how and when we’d like, but He is never silent or ambivalent to us. \nThanks be to Him.\n Written by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

They sing:\nShow them all of your good parts,\nLeave town when the bad ones start to show.\nIsn’t this the inclination of the heart? I like to keep my good works in public view, and keep my shameful side out of sight. Please, notice me for showing up to church on time every Sunday, but don’t look at the way I badgered my family into getting there.\nChrist’s Sermon on the Mount turns everything on its head. His declaration, “you must not be like the hypocrites” (Matthew 6:5), is a direct confrontation to my every natural proclivity. I want people to think the best of me. Is that so wrong? I want to be the sort of guy others can look up to and emulate, which is great. But I quickly slip into a pursuit of reputation, rather than a pursuit of righteousness. I begin to store up treasures on earth. And before I know it, the moths have come, and the rust eats away at my storehouse.\nPride can make much even of humility. It can turn even fasting and prayer into pomp and show. Greed goes out dressed as generosity. Meaningless babble goes out dressed as prayer. And the weight of hypocrisy begins to drag us down.\nOf course, the Sermon on the Mount isn’t chiefly about hypocrisy. It is about the kingdom of God. Hypocrisy is our way of looking like we’re walking in step with the kingdom. We think it might be easier to pretend, to turn a blind eye to the pet sins, to push aside the really difficult parts. We like the idea of dressing in the robes of righteousness, but we don’t want it deep down in our bones. We don’t want it to trouble our habits, to muddle with our comforts, to mess with our bank accounts. We tell ourselves we can serve two masters.\nI wrestle daily with how to confront the hypocritical leanings of my heart. The old carnal man sticks too close for comfort, and I keep tripping over him. Christ’s remedy is simple.\nAsk, and it will be given.\nSeek, and you will find.\nKnock, and the door will be opened. \nAsk, for your Father in heaven gives you the very bread of life. Seek, because He first sought you. Knock, because He Himself is the door. Do not seek for bread that does not satisfy, or water that does not quench, but seek first His kingdom, and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided.\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

It usually starts out civil, but before you know it, you’re yelling at your grandma and throwing the dice across the room. \nIn fact, I think it’s safe to speculate that the ratio of those who have started a game of Monopoly to those who have finished one is staggeringly askew. Sometimes it’s best for everyone’s sanity that the game is called off before completion. \nIf we’re not careful, we can start to think that the Law is a lot like Monopoly. God thought it was a great idea at first, but after a few shouting matches, and a bunch of hurt feelings, He realized it was probably best to just call the whole thing off. In this scenario, He sent Jesus to help extricate us from a flawed game and pronounce us all friends and winners. \nThe trouble with this way of thinking is that Jesus directly contradicts this notion in the midst of the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus didn’t come to abolish the Law or show up as a Plan B to remove unfair rules and arbitrary regulations. Rather, in His own words, He came to fulfill it (Matthew 5:17). \nMatthew 5 is a very special passage because we see Jesus carefully re-calibrating His listeners’ understanding of the Law. Where there was so much emphasis on outward piety, Jesus drills down and applies God’s principles to the heart. What’s also fascinating about this moment is we see a direct resonance with Moses’ original reception on the Law on Sinai. We see a leader of God’s people—and this time God incarnate—standing on a mountain, revitalizing the hearts and lives of His listeners; offering a way to fulfillment that never existed before. \nThrough His fulfillment, Jesus offers release and reprieve for the heavy-laden. He offers rest for the weary. He brings grace and restoration for those who need it most: all of us. In other words, in the Monopoly analogy, Jesus didn’t show up to calm us all down and shelve the game. He came to complete the game that, literally, no one else could even come close to finishing rightly. And we participate in His victory, not because the Law was flawed and needed ending, but because we were incapable of being faithful to it. \nHis love for us is one of the reasons that He didn’t abolish the Law. Because the Law was fundamentally not the problem—our sinfulness, selfishness, and cynicism was. He walked this life all the way through, perfectly and righteously on our behalf. And in His victory, He didn’t just free us from the Law; He makes us co-heirs and co-victors with Him (Romans 8:17).\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

I especially remember that instructional skit in which one of the characters would have four things set in front of him. Three of the items would be identical and one would be different. The song would then start: \nOne of these things is not like the others\nOne of these things just doesn’t belong…\nBefore His earthly ministry started, Jesus came to the Jordan River to be baptized by John the Baptist, the herald who proclaimed the coming Messiah, saying, “Prepare the way for Lord; make his paths straight!” (Matthew 3:3; Isaiah 40:30).\nGod had sent John to inaugurate the Messianic ministry by calling His people to repentance, representing their cleansing by baptism. People flocked to John and his ministry, turning back to God in repentance and faith. And so Jesus also came to John to be baptized. But why? \nThroughout the New Testament we learn that Jesus “did not commit sin” (1 Peter 2:22) and was “holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners” (Hebrews 7:26). Why would the sinless Son of God come to John to receive baptism, a sign indicating the need to have sins washed away? \nWhen Jesus stepped into the Jordan, He was stepping into the waters that had been symbolically polluted by the sin of the great line of those who had gone in before Him. Jesus submitted Himself to having that symbolically polluted water poured over Him. Geoff Thomas captures the scene so well:\n“There is a great line of repentant sinners standing soberly and sorrowing on the bank of the Jordan waiting to go down into the waters… There’s a thief, a drunkard, an adulterer, a liar, a bully, a wife-beater, an idol-worshiper, a torturer, Jesus, a murderer, a forger, a troublemaker, a braggart, a terrorist, a blasphemer, an abuser of children… and hundreds more—every one a sinner, and there is Jesus—made in the likeness of sinful flesh—standing in line.”\nHow do we know Jesus was so very different from the others in that water?\nEven John questioned the need for Jesus’ baptism, at first trying to stop Him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?’” But Jesus said, “Allow it for now, because this is the way for us to fulfill all righteousness” (Matthew 3:14-15). \nSo John baptized Him. Then the heavens opened up. The Holy Spirit descended on Him. And the Father Himself spoke over Jesus: “This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased” (Matthew 3:13-17). \nThe Father’s affirmation would carry Jesus all the way to the cross where He would die for those who could not live without Him. Nailed to the tree and under the wrath of God, Jesus washed away the sins of His people through His bloody baptism on the cross (Luke 12:50). \nImagining Him there now, on the banks of the Jordan River, we must conclude that truly, He is the One who is most certainly not like the others. Yet He became like us in order to redeem us. “God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:21).\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

I received the gospel like it was a gift given especially to me. I was hungry to learn what it meant to live out this new faith, but I had no idea where to begin.\nThe counsel my youth group leaders gave—read the Bible and pray—has since become what I refer to as “the jeans and t-shirt” of the Christian life. Scripture and prayer are so basic, and yet they never go out of style. No matter what is happening in my life, spiritually or otherwise, I am happiest and healthiest when prayer and Scripture are part of my regular rhythm.\nMy youth pastor gave me a “Read the Bible in a Year” plan. That little card directed me to start by splitting my time between Genesis and Matthew. I imagine these are the first books of Scripture for many new believers—the beginnings of the Old and New Testaments.\nToday’s reading—Matthew’s opening two chapters—are a bridge between the Old and New Testaments. They give the history of those who came before Jesus, and the story of His birth, which changes everything that follows. No one understood this better than Matthew himself.\nMatthew was not just an historian. He was a person who knew firsthand the transforming power of the gospel. Matthew was one of Jesus’ twelve disciples, a tax-collector called away from his booth. Jesus called him to stop feeding off the wealth of his countrymen and to give away the riches of God’s kingdom instead.  \nMany people meet Jesus for the first time through Matthew’s Gospel. This was Matthew’s primary goal: to introduce his readers to Jesus. Matthew also introduces us to the world in which Jesus lived, died, and rose again. In this Gospel, we meet key people and groups involved in the story of salvation, from John the Baptist to Pontius Pilate, from the twelve disciples to the Pharisees. And not only that, we also become familiar with the Promised Land itself—Israel, with the Sea of Galilee in the north and Jerusalem on the mountain in the middle. \nAs you read, pay attention to these details: the characters, places, and plot points. Ask the Lord to give you eyes to see things you’ve never before noticed or known. Whether you are new to Scripture or reading this Gospel for the tenth time, my prayer is that we would all come to know Jesus better after spending time in these words.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    “Just one date.”\nI begged my now wife for just one date. And when she granted me that date, which went very well, I had more hopes and fears about my future than I had ever had before. Hope for happiness. Fear of how she felt about me and if she would continue to have feelings toward me. Hope and fear were colliding.\nFear is not flat. There are many different kinds of fear. And even within our varied fears there are emotions and dispositions that may take a lifetime to plumb the depths of. Fear rarely pounds against the insides of our hearts without confusion, excitement, anger, or hope beating in time and alongside.\nThis would explain the reaction of these three women when they went to Jesus’ tomb. \nThey were already sad. It is easy to imagine this was no ordinary grief. They had lost a friend and a Messiah. It is one thing to lose someone you love, knowing they will no longer be with you. But to lose hope would be even harder.\nTo compound that grief, they were preparing to show care and respect by anointing Jesus’ body. I assume this would make the grief even sharper, much like when we go to a funeral and look upon the lifeless body of a loved one. When both of my parents died in the course of two years, this was hard: seeing them look nothing like the laughing and loving people I’d known all my life. Their lifelessness added, if not insult, certainly more pain. Fear was at my elbow, as I am sure it was for these three women.\nThe women also worried they’d not be able to anoint Jesus because the stone blocking the entrance was too heavy. It’s that feeling anyone driving to a funeral can relate to: You want to pay your respects, but on another level, you don’t want to say goodbye. There is even an edge of fear in this.\nAnd then, a glowing man. And everything was reversed. \nThe stone was rolled away. Jesus was not there. He had risen and was now in Galilee. Not in heaven, but in Galilee—which is a real geographical place, like Montgomery. \nImagine showing up at a funeral and the body is not there. The funeral director tells you, “He is not here; he is down the road a bit. He has risen.” Hope? Yes. But also fear, because this is not what was expected.\nIt would be easy to read into how these women didn’t tell anyone what they had seen, even after the angel instructed them to tell the disciples. But their world just tilted on its axis. The thoughts and feelings and fears these women had going to the tomb were now mixed with new hope, eclipsing whatever plans they had otherwise made—possibly even affecting their ability to think straight. \nI have to wonder if a version of the moment these women had at Jesus’ tomb is coming for all whose faith is in Christ—a reckoning where all our fears and hopes are met with the reality of the risen Christ. I look forward to that day. I look forward to the moment when “the hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight.” \nWritten By Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

But I do remember a handful of Sundays when we’d waltz into the little stained glass sanctuary and I’d be pleased to see hymn #172 on the board alongside a few others.\n“O, sometimes it causes me to tremble! tremble! tremble!”\nAs a boy, the story of Jesus’ death made me sad. I’m not entirely sure why, but perhaps it was because while I knew that something incredibly broken had been made right, it came at a great cost.\nNow though, I do tremble. I tremble and quake at the thought of our crucified God. What kind of God lets Himself be killed? A loving God; a very loving God indeed.\nJesus Himself declared, “greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends” (John 15:13). Friends, Jesus laid down His life for us.\n \nHere is what I’ve come to believe:\nI was there when they crucified my Lord.\nYou were there when they crucified your Lord.\nWe all were there when they crucified our Lord.  \nWe were all represented there in the crowd. And as much as we might like to think we would’ve been the one centurion crying out, “truly this man was the Son of God,” that’s likely not the case. What’s more likely is that we would have been among the crowd, jeering, spitting, and yelling, “Crucify Him, crucify Him” (Mark 15:13, 39) \nThe fullness of the cross is a mystery. But what we do know is this: to experience resurrection, we must move through the cross. Jesus carried what we never could—the full weight of our sin. To know the fullness of forgiveness that He purchased through His death and resurrection, we, too, must die to self. \nI know I was there. I know I was there when they crucified my Lord. You were too. There’s no doubt about it. The good news is that, while complicit in His death, by grace we are completely released from condemnation. Even better, we gain the Kingdom of God through faith in His resurrection. \nWhat’s holding you back? Is anything keeping you from participating in the fullness of His mercy? The hard work, the heavy lifting has all been completed on your behalf. All you need to do is surrender; surrender to a God who was willing to die on your behalf and in your place. \nHe’s calling with His clear and gentle way: “The stone was rolled away, son.”\nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

I don’t remember much about our family dynamics, but there was one constant event that sticks in my mind—eating dinner together. Every single night, no matter what else happened, my family sat around the same table and ate dinner. In a sense, the dinner table was an opportunity to recommit to one another, to look across the table and say, “That’s my father, mother, and brother.”\nNot long before His crucifixion, Jesus sat around a table with His family—that ragtag group of disciples He called His brothers. They broke bread and sipped wine, to remember Jesus’ soon-to-be broken body and poured-out blood (Mark 14:24-25). When they looked around at one another, they were bonded together as brothers under the covenant that Jesus’ blood would establish. Christians are bound together by that same blood today.\nSunday morning worship services are more than a time to “get something” from a pastor or worship band; they’re dress rehearsals for eternity. In the final act of God’s story, His family will gather around one table, feasting and giving thanks for Jesus’ broken body and shed blood (Rev. 19:7-10). We rehearse like those disciples, and we look forward to the Last Supper when Jesus returns to make all things right.\nWhile we weekly highlight preaching and music in Sunday morning gatherings (for good reason!), we must not forget the Lord’s Supper, “for as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes” (1 Cor. 11:26). When we praise God through the preaching of His Word, the singing of hymns and songs, and partaking in the Lord’s Supper, we present to the world that multi-sided prism of the ways God is worshiped in eternity.\nWhen we gather around the Lord’s table, our eating and drinking is a recommitment. We look at our brothers and sisters in Christ, and remember that we’re one family, one body. We may go our separate ways throughout the week, visiting each other here and there, but we always come back to the same table. We collectively hold the bread and wine or juice and look upward to our Father in heaven, who sent His Son for us.\nJesus came into the world to save it, and yet He was despised and rejected (Isa. 53:3; Matt. 27:15-44; John 19:1-7). He was nailed to a cross, dying the death we deserved. His cross seemed like an upright coffin, but was actually a victory chariot. Three days after His crucifixion, His heart kick-started and He walked out of the grave, prevailing over the sin and death that nailed Him to the cross.\nThe Lord’s Supper is a beautiful, powerful, tangible reminder of that victory. Because of Jesus, we are sons and daughters, adopted by the Father (Gal. 4:4-7). Take a seat at the table with your brothers and sisters, and proclaim what He has done.\nWritten By Brandon Smith \n \n\n                ",

What causes you to get lost in the weeds of the tyranny of the urgent? What takes your eyes off of the future glory promised to those who follow after Christ? And what are you to do about it?\nThe truth is, many of the things that compete for our attention are good things—things we can’t forsake, like our jobs, relationships, marriages, children, ministries, and causes. Though the Christ-follower’s eternal destiny is a glorious one, the trails we follow through this life to that glory often demand a lot from us.\nI am a hiker. I love going deep into the mountains, far from civilization, with everything I need in a pack on my back. I love climbing up to vistas that are only made sweeter because the difficulty required to get there. When I finally get to the top of a mountain and drop my pack on the ground and take in the view, I am overwhelmed with a sense of awe and worship. Up there I see the beauty of creation with clear eyes and a full heart. Up there I always feel that I was made to take in far more glory than I do.\nBut it seems the higher the summit, the steeper the trail. On the steep trails, I find that I cannot walk and take in the views at the same time, lest I stumble and fall. I must watch my feet. I must read the terrain right in front of me. If I don’t, I will break an ankle or lose my way. There is so much glory to see on the way up, but I dare not try to take it in as I hike.\nI have hiking buddy, Nick, who does a good job of making us stop and look around as we climb. I’ll hear him say, “Man, look at that.” By this he means, “Look at all of it.” We’ll stop, catch our breath, and look around before putting our heads back down to study another stretch of the trail. This pattern eventually leads us to the summit.\nI don’t think Jesus’ call to be alert and stay awake is a call to only be concerned with the future glory that awaits. We go through seasons where the trail in front of us demands our attention. I believe what He is saying is that, along the way, we need to regularly stop and look at the bigger reality surrounding us. We need to remember that the path we follow leads to inevitable glory and that before we know it, that glory will be all we know.\nIt would be a shame if we walked this entire path and never stopped to notice the beauty around us and the heights of glory ahead.\nSo be alert. Stay awake. Stop and look around you. You’ll only be on this path for a while.\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

Today’s verses tell us as much, as we read them and shake our heads at those Pharisees and Sadducees and think, Wow, how could you guys be so blind?\nLike all great teachers, Jesus was also a great storyteller. Mark 12 begins by describing Jesus as such. And the culture of our day, at least the cross-section of our culture that is interested in spiritual matters, has no problem giving Jesus credit for being a good storyteller. It’s clear He knew how to tell a tale. We the people are all about story, and narrative, and parable, and the hero’s journey, and, well, you get the point. But if we’re not very careful we can be just as sightless as those blind guys from Jesus’ day.\nAnd how, you ask, could that happen?\nIs Jesus the most excellent Teacher? Yes. Is Jesus the grand Storyteller? Yes again. But there was and is a greater identity that Jesus came to reveal: He is the great I AM—the subject of His own teaching, the Hero of the big story. If we the people hold the pieces of Jesus we prefer to the exclusion of the whole, then we’re no better off than the Pharisees and Sadducees of way back when. Oh sure, we’ve got iPhones and cars that parallel park themselves, but in terms of what eternally matters, we still lack vision and understanding.\nJesus didn’t say, “I’m sorta like the Father.” No, His claim was, “I and the Father are one” (John 10:30). In other words, “If you want to know what God looks like, look at me.” And it was that kind of truth-talk that drove the Pharisees and Sadducees nuts back in Jesus’ day. And it’s that same kind of truth-talk that separates the sheep and the goats today.\nThis chapter ends with the humbling story of the poor widow and her two cents. In a way, she represents us, for that’s essentially what believers have to share with the world—our two cents: that Jesus is the God we are to love with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength. \nBut the poor widow reminds us that the gospel is more than a story we tell or a lesson we learn. Telling and living the story of Christ will cost us more than all the others put together. It demands of us an extravagance, that we give our all. Why? Because it is more than a story we tell. It is the story we are in. May we never become blind to that.\nWritten By John Blase \n\n                ",

Frankly, donkeys are just not highly sought after animals. They are the animal equivalent of the Datsun. You’ll never hear a child say, “I really want a donkey this Christmas.” \nAnd yet, it was a donkey that our Lord rode into Jerusalem. Zechariah prophesied that Israel’s King would come “lowly and riding on a donkey” (Zech. 9:9). What has often been called “the triumphal entry” might just as soon be called “the humble entry.” This was to highlight the humble means by which the Kingdom of God advances, as well as the humble King through whom it advances.\nThe German theologian, Frederick Krummacher—in his marvelous work, The Suffering Savior— made an interesting observation about the manner in which Christ comes as King and the way in which His kingdom advances through the Church. He wrote:\nThe whole scene of the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem… gives us a hint in what manner Christ, for centuries together, will manifest Himself on earth until His second coming… Zechariah, confirms and attests this, in the words, “Behold thy King comes unto you, lowly…” a word that describes at the same time the idea of an entire absence of display, pomp, and dignity; and this is the attribute which is peculiar to His government to this hour.\nThe Kingdom of God advanced, in the days of Christ, with our Lord riding on the back of a donkey. The Kingdom advanced in lowliness and in unassuming ways. It did not advance by human wisdom and insight. It did not advance in any external attraction. \nIf it were left to men, the King would have ridden to power on a war-horse. But He didn’t. \nHe rode to the cross on the lowliest of animals. Lowliness and gentleness were the two personal attributes to which Christ appealed. When He called sinners to Himself, He did so by saying, “Come unto Me all you who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest; take My yoke upon you and learn of Me for I am gentle and lowly hearted and you will find rest for your souls” (Matt. 11:28-29).\nToday, as in the days of Christ’s earthly ministry, the Kingdom of God advances through God’s use of humble people who spread the knowledge of Christ through the proclamation of the King who was crucified for our sins. It continues to advance through the foolishness of preaching by weak individuals. It advances by unassuming means. \nGod’s Kingdom advances now as it did then—through humility. May we never forget this most important lesson from the life our Lord.\nWritten By Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

This is what He did with the Rich Young Ruler, who was trying to live in two kingdoms at the same time.\nThe Rich Young Ruler embodies everything our culture prizes: he is rich, young, and powerful. On top of that, he cares about spiritual matters and conducting himself in an upright way. He has life this side of the grave pretty well buttoned up. He is a devoted Jew—someone who knows and swears he upholds God’s Law. He is a good guy. His life is full of good things of his own making. And he knows it. In fact, he banks on it.\nBut something is bugging him. Something moves him to go to Jesus and say basically this: “I’ve done everything right. I’ve succeeded economically, socially, morally, and even religiously. Teacher, I’ve heard you are wise—and look, I even seek out wisdom. What I’m wondering is this: Is there something I’ve overlooked?” \nOf course there is something he has overlooked. We don’t ask questions like this unless there’s something nagging at us.\nHow does Jesus respond? He frustrates the man: “Here’s what you lack: sell all you have. Give it all to the poor and trust that your treasure will be in heaven. Then come follow me” (Mark 10:21, my paraphrase). In other words, Jesus is calling this man to lay down his entire approach to security.\nAt this, the young man walks away sad. Jesus’ counsel is too rich for his blood.\nWas Jesus just trying to show this man up? Humiliate him? No, that’s not Jesus’ way. In fact, our text tells us that when the young man asserted that he’d kept the Law of God since the time he was a boy, Jesus “looked at him and loved him” – a detail given to tell us this is exchange is not acrimonious (v. 21).\nJesus frustrates the man for the same reason He sometimes frustrates us—to show us how tight our grip is on the things of this world that have nothing to do with the next. It isn’t the young man’s wealth Jesus objects to. It is his need of that wealth.\nI love that we’re not told the rest of this story. Did the young man walk away sad, never to return? Or did Jesus’ words stick in him like a splinter, infecting his false sense of security until he came back to ask the Great Physician for help? We’re not told. But I know many people who found mercy and grace as a result of being frustrated by truth.\nWhere are you walking away sad from a confrontation with Truth?

They say the right things. They even preached some sermons and did a few miracles. But they’re still missing it. So Jesus moves from subtlety (if you can call walking on water or feeding thousands “subtle”) to clarity. He shows His glory. Quite literally.\nOn the top of a mountain Jesus reveals a side of Himself to Peter, James, and John – His three closest friends – that no human being had ever seen. He “transformed in front of them” into a dazzling, magnificent, indescribable being and along side Him were Moses and Elijah, the two greatest prophets of Israel’s history. \nIn a moment, these disciples caught a glimpse of divine glory, and in that moment were given an understanding that Jesus was the beautiful fulfillment of all Moses, Elijah, and every other prophet had stood for. He was the embodiment of their prophecies, their leadership, their sacrifice, their message, and martyrdom. And if that was not enough for the terrified, overwhelmed disciples, suddenly a voice boomed from heaven, “This is my beloved Son; listen to Him!” God Himself glorified Jesus in that moment.\nCan you imagine what the trip down that mountain was like? What thoughts were the disciples having? Thoughts of power? Utter confusion? Certainty that Jesus would rise up and bring His kingdom to bear against Rome that very day? \nWe can’t know, but you can be sure that what happened when they arrived at the foot of the mountain was not what they expected.\nFirst, Jesus cast a demon out of a boy that nobody else had been able to cast out, showing His power over the forces of evil once again and in the process showing compassion for the fragile faith of the boy’s father. \nBut then Jesus did something decidedly un-glorious. He predicted His own death. He explicitly said He would be killed. That is not what glory looks like.\nAnd then He explained that the greatest must be the least, the servant of all. The greatest must become like a child. That is not what glory looks like either.\nExcept that it is. Glory, in God’s economy, looks like sacrifice and humility and servanthood. Jesus showed this throughout all of His life and death. What Jesus revealed on the mountain and in His life was the road to glory: humility leading to glorification. \nIn this life we are called to serve and sacrifice, and to do so at any cost so that we neither stumble nor cause another to fall. We are called to lay down our lives. This is the way to glory. This is the example of Jesus – the glorified Son of God.\nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

But there are times when I read this story and all the unbelief surrounding his confession makes we wonder if he said it with a question mark in his mind.\n“We hope you are the Messiah. Please be the Messiah.”\nAll of chapter 8 really is a summation of the life of Jesus. Think about it. He feeds people miraculously. The Pharisees demand a sign because they do not believe Him. His disciples worry about having enough to eat in the wake of watching Him feed all those people with the equivalent of a Happy Meal. He heals a blind man. Peter makes the great confession of belief that Jesus is the Messiah they have been waiting for. Jesus foretells His death and resurrection for which Peter rebukes Him. There’s a lot in there.\nWhile Peter was right about Jesus being the Messiah, all the surrounding unbelief causes me to look sideways at his great pronouncement of faith. And to be fair, it causes me to look sideways at my own great pronouncements of faith too. I sometimes look at the religious world (the Pharisees) and the irreligious world (Herod) and, with great conviction, make certain pronouncements about my own faith and convictions – noble claims of wisdom and maturity.\nBut sometimes when I do, I look sideways at myself. Why do I do that?\nBecause for all my displays of confidence, when I’m down to one loaf of bread, I wonder how I’m going to eat. We have a nice house with a full pantry and a full fridge. Actually we have two refrigerators. And the second is for the overflow. \nThis fact alone makes me suspect that my version of unbelief believes that more than enough is not enough.\nThe disciples should have said, “We have one loaf of bread and the Messiah. And that is more than enough.” But they had forgotten how Jesus had provided sufficiently with so little before. One loaf of bread with Jesus is more than plenty.\nEven with all I have, I forget this. I look at the future and worry about my family, wondering if we have enough. What if things go bad and the pantry goes bare? It’s happened before. There was a time when we had so little we had to say, “all we have is…” But we knew we had the Christ. And we watched Him take care of us in some lean times.\nGrand pronouncements are great. But what I really need, and what you really, need is a faith that looks at what we have, no matter how much or how little, and says, “One loaf of bread and Jesus is more than enough.”\nWritten By Matthew B. Redmond\n \n\n                ",

In fact, these are often simply the clever traps of the devil, who is quite practiced in ensnaring the hearts of men; he would supplant genuine Christ-likeness in exchange for a pseudo-righteousness built on human traditions.\nTo make matters more difficult, our own hearts are deceitfully wicked, and hypocrisy is perhaps the easiest of sins to fall into. John Owen, the great Puritan minister, once observed, “No man preaches his sermon well to others if he doth not first preach it to his own heart.” \nYet we are quick to ignore our own faults and find faults of others. We are prone to assume as faults those things which only disagree with our own pride, with our own faulty measure of righteousness. We hold in high esteem those who think as we do, those who tickle our ears, who make us feel high and holy, who praise our accomplishments. Desiring to justify ourselves, we elevate our own righteousness, and pass it off as God’s confirmation of our goodness, our worthiness, our fitness, because, after all, this position of wealth, influence, and respect I enjoy is because I’ve done something good. Right? \nOur hearts are deceitfully wicked. Like the Pharisees, we have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish our own traditions. Yes, and many such things we do (Mark 7:13).\nBut Christ does not measure by outward forms, by the appearance of righteousness, or even by the applause of many good believers. No. Instead, He declares: “From within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person” (Mark 7:21-23).\nDo you see yourself in this list? I see myself. By Christ’s interpretation of the law, we are all weighed, measured, and found grossly wanting, for He searches the heart and tests the mind (Jeremiah 17:10).\nYes, our hearts are desperately sick (Jeremiah 17:9). Christ, therefore, bids us look to nothing else but Him. He alone does all things well. May we fall at His feet, and may Christ Himself open our eyes, our ears, and our hearts that we may draw near to Him.\nWritten By Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

You used to cruise around this neighborhood on your bike and cause all sorts of trouble.”\nOne visit to the town you grew up in and you’ll hear something like this. It even happened to Jesus. The problem was that Jesus wasn’t just in town for the holidays; He was on a mission to save the world and He wanted to begin with those He knew and loved most. \nInstead, all He got was “Isn’t that Mary’s boy? I think He made me my end table a while back.”\nThe closeness of the people in Nazareth to Jesus blinded them to His identity. They could not hear the truth or power of His words, and He could not do any miracles there, because of their unbelief. All they could see was the son of the carpenter. \nSo Jesus gathered His twelve disciples and commissioned them to take His mission to other parts of Israel. And did they ever – preaching with power, seeing people repent, and even casting out demons in Jesus’ name.\nIt was a shame that the people of Nazareth missed out, but the story turns here. The mission is progressing nicely. Right? Well, about that…\nIn a remote place, Jesus preached to a crowd of 5,000 men and likely as many women and children. They are hungry; so He told His disciples, those same twelve, to feed the people and they panicked. “How can we? Should we spend half a year’s salary on food?” So Jesus miraculously provided. Only this time, it was the disciples who did not believe.\nHours later, as they sailed to their next stop through high seas and strong winds, Jesus came walking across the water toward them. When they panicked and cried out, “It’s a ghost!”, Jesus reassured them. Still, the disciples did not believe.\nIt’s easy to look at the people of Nazareth and shake our heads at their hard hearts. It’s easy for us to look at the disciples and tsk tsk just a little. How could they preach and perform miracles and still not believe? What we should see is ourselves. We should see our own blindness and unbelief and our own ability to overlook the great things Jesus has done. We, too, see miracles and brush them off or fail to understand. We see them in Scripture. We see them in our own salvation. Yet still we panic. We doubt. We wander.\nThankfully, Jesus provides and reassures and draws us close to Himself. He continues to reveal Himself to those seeking to believe, so that over time we truly can.\nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

It refers to someone who’s all show—maybe a big Stetson, fancy boots, and a starched snap shirt. He looks the part, and may even sound the part. But when approached for help finishing up some ranch chore, you’d discover lickety-split that he doesn’t know squat about actual cowboying. There’s the appearance of authority, but when pressed, he’s all hat and no cattle.  \nMark 5 presents three instances of Jesus going all hat and all cattle—the appearance and authority. But in the case of Jesus, the appearance was not due to fancy boots or some external marker, but rather the sum total of His divine/human presence.\nIn all three episodes in this chapter, the main characters “see Jesus” and recognize that He’s no ordinary man. How did they know this? Well, I don’t know; the text says they simply did. But that’s not hard to imagine, right? We’ve all had the experience of someone walking into a room, and without saying a word their presence relays the message, “Here comes the boss.”\nFirst, Jesus frees a lonely man from a legion of demons, and sends that hell to the pigs, literally. The evil knew who Jesus was, and that He meant business when it came to liberating the captives. The next two instances are brief encounters Jesus has with a leader of men and a woman out of options. They, too, “saw Jesus,” and they were so taken with His magnificence that Jairus trusted Jesus simply to speak healing authority laden words, even from a distance, while the woman bet it all on being able just to brush against the robe that wrapped the Son of Man.\nThe authority Jesus carried in His human frame was something the world had never seen. In the case of Jairus’ daughter, Jesus raised that little girl from the icy grip of death. And in the case of the woman (whom Jesus addressed as “daughter”), Jesus raised her to stand upright, no longer shame-bent, but now whole and healed.\nIt’s not reflected in the text, but something tells me Jesus walked away from those three moments, and all the people said, “All hat and all cattle.” Why? Because that same power of presence draws people to Him still.\nWritten By John Blase\n\n                ",

It was my family’s when I was a kid. My father would lead us along the winding path through the trees to a clearing in which we had built a small plot. Each season we’d enjoy its yield of zucchini, squash, lettuce, tomatoes, and a few spicy peppers. (We tried watermelon once, but I don’t think it ever produced fruit.)\nMaybe the warmth of those summers and the sweetness of those harvests has lead me to romanticize the farming life. Or perhaps I’ve just read too much Wendell Berry. Either way, my great-grandfather was a lifelong career farmer, and a handful of conversations with his side of the family has helped dispel the myth that the farm life is pure laid-back country bliss. It certainly has its perks and joys, but I’ve come to accept that it’s not “Green Acres” all the time. It’s a lot of hard work, sweat on your brow, and pain in your back.\nThis is not to diminish the goodness and richness of a life spent working the land, but rather to point out that, as a child, I experienced the joys of planting and harvesting with minimal effort beforehand or in between those two seasons.\nYou see, I never really saw all of the work that went into preparing the soil, or all of the effort spent by my folks as they weeded and watered and pruned. My parents did all the heavy lifting on the front end, and then my brothers and I had a lot of fun planting the seeds when the time was right. Same with the harvest. Our folks took care of the majority of daily maintenance while we kids experienced the joy of reaping rich fruit.\nI’ve heard the Parable of the Sower preached a variety of ways in my lifetime, usually with one of two emphases. The first asks the congregation to examine their hearts and determine what sort of soil they are; “are you the rocky soil?!” The second is typically a call to evangelism; “you need to be sowing those seeds!”\nI’ve always had a tough time with that second application. Not because I think it’s wrong, but because it’s difficult to live out, and even more difficult to know if it’s working or if you’re doing it right.\nHere’s the good news though: many times, the conversations you have with those around you are really acts of tilling and preparing the soil. You may not know it, and they may not know it, but the time and energy you’re investing will be realized later. This is all important work.\nIn Mark 4, Jesus is tipping off His followers that not everyone who hears the message is ready to receive it. And many who hear His words won’t be able to hold onto them. The good news for us is that we don’t have be able to know which soils are which. All we have to do is to be faithful to our calling. Sometimes this means tilling, sometimes it means planting. Other times it may mean harvesting.\nAs individuals, we do not carry the full weight of another’s conversion. We may share the gospel with someone for years and never see them come to faith in Christ. But that doesn’t mean our efforts are in vain. Perhaps we are the ones God has called to till the soil and help prepare it so that it can eventually receive and hold onto the word of God. \nWhether tilling, or sowing, or harvesting, we are called to be faithful. God will handle the rest. \nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

If she starts to even barely insinuate that I might have done something wrong, I get defensive. I want to be the hero!\nAs we pull out of Mark 1 and into Mark 2 and 3, we start to see Jesus preaching, healing, and forgiving. He’s setting all things right. Jesus is about the work of the Kingdom, restoring broken creation to Himself. If you scan over chapters two and three, you see Jesus with a paralytic, a tax collector, the Pharisees, a man with a withered hand, a great crowd, the disciples, and His mother and brothers. What a great Savior in the midst of His people—all different types of people!\nWhere might you find yourself in that crew?\nLook at the first narrative, where several men bring their friend to Jesus through the roof of the house where He’s speaking. They’re committed. They’re full of faith. They’re a band of brothers. They are strong and resourceful, if perhaps not respecters of the property of others (since they destroy the roof). I naturally think of how I need to and want to bring others to Jesus like this.\nBut.\nBut what if I’m the paralyzed man? What if I’m the one depending on help? What if I’m the tax collector, someone who is despised? What if I’m most often a rule follower, someone who loves to argue with Jesus? I may call it asking a good question, but I’m suspicious of any answer He gives me that butts up against my preconceived theological and practical opinions.\nWhat if I am not the hero of my own story? What if I need healing and forgiveness? What if I need to follow Jesus, no matter where He leads me?\nThe good news is that the Son of Man forgives sins. He is the Great High Priest. He says I can be washed clean by His atoning sacrificial blood. I can be set free, and I can also be healed.\nHe’s calling us to Himself. But we won’t make it on our own merit. This must be His work. We’re sick. We’re malformed. We’re not the righteous. We’re sinners. We need His Word and His deeds, His parables and His miracles. We need the Great Physician.

You mean I need to admit my faults in front of others and endure their disapproval?” Or is it something more like, “This is terrific! I’m being invited into a process of restoration, which my wayward heart desperately needs”?\nGospel repentance is always the latter. In Christ, the call to repent is always a call to enter into the joy of being restored.\nI bring this up because Jesus’ first statement in Mark’s Gospel is exactly that—a call to repent. “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the good news!” (v. 15).\nWhat is He saying?\nIt’s a pretty audacious way to start. When Jesus stepped onto the scene, the first thing He did was essentially say, All of history has been waiting for Me to arrive. The Kingdom of God has stepped into your world in the form of a man. What you’ve needed most since the fall of man has come—Me.\nThen He says, “Repent and believe the gospel.” This is a twofold call—repent and believe. Let’s break that call down by starting with the second half first: believe the gospel. The word gospel literally means “news that brings great joy.” So Jesus’ implication here is that His message is “news”—something as yet unheard and unknown—which should draw from us a response of joy. What is that joy about? The first part of His call tells us: it is the joy of being restored.\nThe news that brings great joy calls us to repent, which is to recognize that we have reason to admit fault, confess sin and brokenness, and literally “reverse course.” \nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is a liberating insult to our pride. We are called, here at the start, to lay down our sin and arrogance, relent of our stubbornness and fear, and trust that repentance will not lead to condemnation, but to joy.\nIn Christ, this is what repentance is all about—entering into joy. The reason we repent is not to convince God to do something gracious so that we might come to know Him. It is because He already has. The Kingdom of God is at hand in Christ. The call to repent is always a call into the joy of the gospel that bears His name.\nWhat Jesus is telling us in His call to repent and believe in Him is that there is no other way to find the life we were made to live outside of a relationship with God, and that the only way to have that relationship healed, which is otherwise broken, is through faith in Christ. This is the message of Mark’s entire Gospel.\nYou were meant to live in right relationship with your Maker. The call to repent is the call to examine your heart before God and enter into the joy being restored to Him. So, hear that call. Examine yourself before Him. Repent. Believe. And read on.\nWritten By Russ Ramsey \n\n                ",

Waking up days later in what must have seemed like heaven compared to the vile and jagged landscape of Mordor, Sam says, “Gandalf! I thought you were dead! But then I thought I was dead myself. Is everything sad going to come untrue? What’s happened to the world?”\nI may lose some fantasy-geek credibility with this confession, but I must admit I read The Lord of the Rings only after seeing the films. So, years ago, when I first watched The Return of the King, the third installment in the trilogy, I actually didn’t know if Frodo and Sam were going to make it out of Mordor alive. They could die, I thought. And if they had given their lives to rescue the world from evil, it would have been a picture of the gospel. On Good Friday, Jesus willingly laid down His life to save the world from the curse of sin.\nBut the gospel story doesn’t end in death. On the other side of the cross, there is an empty tomb. As Mary and the other women puzzled about the missing body of Jesus, Luke tells us two angels—men in dazzling clothes—appeared and asked, “Why are you looking for the living among the dead?… He is not here, but he has risen!” (Luke 24:5–6). Of course, these female disciples of Jesus were shocked by this declaration, but the news was even better than they could have imagined: the empty tomb was still only the beginning of the end of the gospel story.\nThe apostle Paul tells us that the garden tomb will not be the only empty one. Jesus is the firstfruits of the resurrection of the dead that will take place at the end of history (1 Corinthians 15:20–23). And in the book of Revelation, John tells us that on that day, “Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away” (21:4). Swords will be turned into plows, wolves and lambs will live together, and the knowledge of the Lord will fill the earth (Isaiah 2:4; 11:6; Habakkuk 2:14). Indeed, all things will be made new (Matthew 19:28; Revelation 21:5). Just as Samwise guessed, everything sad is now coming untrue.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

There’s Pilate, the Roman governor with a history of cruelty and a penchant for expediency. There’s Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee, who had Jesus’s cousin John beheaded to save face with his party guests. There’s also Barabbas, the murderer who’s freed so that Jesus would die. And of course, there are the Jewish leaders who arrested Jesus and brought Him to trial in the first place. To paraphrase Obi-Wan Kenobi of Star Wars, we may never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy than the one found in this chapter.\nBut in Luke chapter 23, we find these famous words from Jesus: “Father, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing” (v.34). He’s been falsely accused, spat upon, beaten, tortured, condemned, mocked, and nailed to a cross, yet Jesus uses His hard-fought breath to ask His Father to forgive the people responsible for His pain. Of course, the cross had first been God’s plan (Acts 2:23), and Jesus laid down His life willingly (John 10:18), but none of that cancels out the wickedness on display in these scenes.\nA few verses after Jesus uttered this prayer, we read that one of the criminals being crucified next to Jesus used his waning strength to mock the Son of God. He shouted to Jesus, “Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!” (v.39). Oh, the irony. If only this thief had known that it was precisely because Jesus wanted to save people like him that He would not step down from that cross, even though He could have at any time.\nOn the other side of Jesus was another man being crucified for his crimes, but this one struck a different tone. “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom,” he said (v.42). None of the Gospel writers tells us how this thief knew who Jesus was or that He was bringing a kingdom, but however he knew, his encounter with Jesus sparked faith. Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise” (v.43).\nOn the surface, this man should have been no different than his counterpart on the far side of Jesus. Both were criminals, rightly convicted for crimes against the state. Both were sentenced to die, with just hours left till their muscles gave out and they suffocated under their own weight. But one taunted Jesus, while the other reached out in faith. The gospel has the power to transform the hearts of even the vilest of sinners. This side of the grave, no one is too far gone to turn, repent, and receive the grace of God.\nThat’s how good Jesus is. He endured everything this world could throw at Him, only to die and make a way of salvation for the very people doing the throwing. In the cosmic scheme of things, there’s not much separating you and me from the two criminals who died next to Jesus. We, too, are guilty. We, too, deserve death. And we, too, must decide what we will do when confronted with Jesus.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

That’s because when we were first starting out, we didn’t have a shared history to talk about yet. We also didn’t have much of a present life together either. And while most of our relationship was still in the future, we would have freaked each other out on that first date to talk about the kids we might have or the places we might live.\nBut now we have it all: the past, present, and future, and they collide whenever we get to spend time together. We talk about what it was like when we first fell in love. We talk about our wedding, and our first house together. We talk about our kids—what they were like as newborns and that cute thing they did this morning. We talk about our current challenges and what God is teaching us. And we talk about the future: our hopes and dreams, that beat up, old Jeep I’m going to buy someday, and the sewing room Laurin would like to have. On these dates, the past, present, and future come crashing together, and it’s beautiful.\nSomething like this was at work when Jesus sat down with His disciples for the meal we now know as the Last Supper. The meal was a Passover celebration, a time for the people of God to look back and remember how He delivered their ancestors from Egypt and made them into a nation, and how a spotless lamb took the place of every firstborn son of Israel the night the Lord visited Egypt in judgment.\nBut the Last Supper was also a time to think about the future. Before the meal, Jesus told His friends how much He was looking forward to sharing Passover with them. “For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God” (Luke 22:16). One day there will be another supper, one to which every Passover meal and Lord’s Supper commemoration look forward: the marriage feast of the Lamb (Revelation 19:9). That meal will be a celebration of God’s ultimate deliverance of His people, from sin and death and this present evil age. It will be the party that puts all other parties to shame, because, at last, Jesus and His bride, the Church, will be together forever.\nLooming over these echoes of the past and nods to the future was a very real and very difficult present. Judas, one of the Twelve, was about to betray Jesus. The disciples would abandon their Master. Jesus would be arrested and put on trial. Peter would deny Him three times. The Son of God would be mocked, spat upon, tortured, and crucified. He would die like the lowest of criminals. With all this weighing on His mind, Jesus looked at His disciples around the table and then “took bread, gave thanks, broke it, gave it to them, and said, ‘This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me’” (Luke 22:19).\nIn that moment, the past, the present, and the future collided. The Passover was always about so much more than an escape from Egypt; it was about the spotless Lamb of God who would be broken to take away the sins of the world. And the marriage feast of the Lamb could never happen if Jesus’s bride were left in her filthy rags. She needed to be cleansed, purified, and dressed in fine linen, “bright and pure” (Revelation 19:8).\nShe is made pure—we are made pure—because Jesus took her sins upon Himself. Thanks be to God for what He has done in the past, for His Spirit’s power at work in the present, and for the future He has secured through the faithful obedience of His Son.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Recently, I’ve been trying to teach my son Jonah to discern the difference between what matters and what doesn’t. For example, there’s no sense getting worked up when his younger brother Jude “steals” his favorite toy truck, because we have lots of trucks (and Jude tends to move on to a new toy every five minutes or so). Or, when we’re working on his reading skills, if he doesn’t know a word, that’s okay; we can sound it out together and keep trying till he figures it out.\nMore importantly, I have also been trying to instill in Jonah the unbreakable fact that no matter what happens in his four-year-old world, his mother and I love him to the moon and back. Nothing he can do has the power to change that. In the long run, that truth matters, while so many others do not.\nThere is a marked difference between what matters for today and what matters for eternity, and one day, the two will be sorted out. Jesus made this point as He and His disciples were observing the temple. As large and beautiful as the complex was, Jesus told His friends, “not one stone will be left on another” (Luke 21:6).\nThis statement got the attention of the disciples, and they asked Jesus when this stone-toppling destruction day would be and what signs would mark its coming. In true prophetic fashion, Jesus’s response is both specific (“Those in Judea must flee to the mountains” [v.21]), and somewhat vague (“When you hear of wars and rebellions, don’t be alarmed” [v.9]). There’s also a sense in which His words apply to the destruction of Jerusalem, which happened in the year AD 70 (see vv.20–24,32 especially), and another sense in which they apply to the end of history as we know it (see vv.25–28,34–36).\nWriting about this discourse and its parallel passages in Matthew and Mark, Bible scholars and theologians have emptied countless fountain pens in their attempts to unpack the myriad opinions on how we should understand Jesus’s words. And while the discussion is a fascinating one, in my opinion the most important principle to be found in this chapter is among the most straightforward of Jesus’s statements: “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away” (v.33).\nWhat matters most—and what will last for eternity—are those things we do in response to the words spoken by God, whether they came from the lips of Jesus or were inspired by the Holy Spirit and recorded for us in Scripture. Jesus said, “Heaven and earth will pass away.” That means we won’t be able to hold onto anything we’ve built for ourselves. However, the author of Hebrews tells us, “we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken” (Hebrews 12:28). Our task until that kingdom comes in its fullness is to be obedient to His Word.\nGod speaks because He loves us. We can trust His Word, no matter what comes.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    During presidential election seasons, I love tuning in to watch candidates on the debate stage, especially if it’s a town-hall-style forum with questions from the audience. At rallies and in speeches, would-be presidents can deliver canned remarks and offer vague promises, but in an open forum, the voters are free to ask almost anything. At these events, the novices are easily separated from the seasoned politicians. The professionals know how to turn the answer to a difficult question into a great television moment.\nIn politics, this can be a terrible thing, as style can overtake substance pretty quickly. But the art of answering tough questions well doesn’t need to be an effort in deception. In fact, there has never been anyone better at answering tough questions than Jesus. Whatever trap the Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians, or scribes tried to set for Him, Jesus avoided the snare and turned their own words against them.\nTake, for example, the scene in Luke 20. Jesus was in Jerusalem, knowing He had come to town to die. His enemies among the religious elite were eager to oblige, looking for a way to turn the crowds against Him or get Him to incriminate Himself. As part of this effort, a group of Sadducees approached Jesus with a ridiculous, almost comical, scenario based on a minor point of the Mosaic Law.\nThe particular law concerned a man who dies without having children. In order for his widow be cared for and his line perpetuated, the dead man’s brother was to marry his wife and produce a child to be the man’s heir (see Deuteronomy 25:5). But in the minds of the Sadducees, this passage poked a gaping hole in the doctrine of the future resurrection. Their question was: If seven brothers, in keeping this law, all married the same woman, whose wife would she be at the resurrection?\nJesus’s response came in two parts. First, He said that marriage is only needed for this age, for in the age to come, people will no longer die, so they won’t need children to keep their legacy alive (v.36). The whole premise of the Sadducees’ question was faulty. Then, Jesus gets to the heart of the matter: the resurrection.\nThe Sadducees had hoped to stump Jesus, so that it might appear to the watching crowds that Jesus was at odds with the universally revered Law of Moses. But Jesus used Moses to show the Pharisees that it was they—and not Him—who were out of step with the Law.\nGenerations after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob died and were buried, God was still speaking about His friends in the present tense. That’s because they were—and are—alive and present with the Lord, awaiting the final resurrection when they will be forever united with their transformed bodies on a renewed earth. This is our “living hope,” as Peter put it (1 Peter 1:3), and it is secure because Jesus defeated the power of sin and death on the cross.\nAs Jesus illustrated in His answer to the Sadducees’ question, this hope was never a “plan B,” an afterthought from God. It was woven into the story of redemption from the beginning. And with each passing day, this hope we share with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob draws nearer and nearer. Thanks be to God!\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    “Jesus wept” (John 11:35). This is the shortest verse in the Bible, and it occurs in the context of death—the death of an individual named Lazarus, a brother to Mary and Martha, and a friend dear to Jesus. While there have been attempts over the years to read something more into the verse, it’s best to let it mean what it means: Jesus broke down and cried.\nBut there’s another passage in Scripture where Jesus cried. It’s tucked away in Luke 19, as Jesus enters the city of Jerusalem on the back of a borrowed donkey. The whole crowd following Him began to shout, “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord” (Luke 19:38). But as usual, a number of Pharisees were there and told Jesus to silence His supporters. “He answered, ‘I tell you, if they were to keep silent, the stones would cry out’” (v.40).\nAnd as He inched closer and closer to Jerusalem, Luke tells us that Jesus wept (v.41). Again, it’s best if we understand this literally; Jesus broke down and cried. But this time, His tears were not for a friend, but for a city that God had set apart from all others. And instead of crying over something that had already happened, this time Jesus’s tears flowed for future days when the beautiful city would be crushed by its enemies. Jesus said these enemies would not “leave one stone on another in your midst, because you did not recognize the time when God visited you” (v.44).\nEarlier in the chapter, Zacchaeus went to great lengths to see Jesus, knowing He was more than just another teacher. Now, Jesus sheds tears because Jerusalem did not see Him for who He was, God in the flesh, the Savior of the world, the King of kings and Lord of lords, come to deliver people from their sins. Yes, there were some disciples who knew who He was, and creation itself (the stones) knew too. But most people missed the One whose love drove Him to tears, and in the days to follow, to a cross.\nThe Son of God’s love for sinners is this way. He left the glories of heaven to enter the stage of history, only to die so that those who rejected Him as King might one day turn, repent, and be saved. If there had been no crowds that Sunday when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the rocks would have shouted “Hosanna!” Even so, He would have entered the city all the same, because Jesus’s love for His people is greater than any force that would try to stop Him.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

But I can still remember the lessons we tried to teach their malleable minds. One of them (and it actually still continues to this day) is summed up in a familiar phrase: “Use your words. What do you want?” As toddlers and young children, they would often point, or cry, or utilize any number of other non-verbal behaviors to communicate to us what they wanted or needed. And while we could sometimes interpret, our goal was to get them to speak their desires clearly, to use their words. The crying and tantrums have since stopped, but in some ways, it’s a lesson we continue to emphasize now that they’re older. Truth be told, it’s still a lesson I’m learning in my fifties.\nLuke 18 tells us that as Jesus made His way toward Jericho, He told parables. He also met an interesting cast of characters, one being a blind man. It wasn’t the first blind man Jesus had come across, but this man’s story is rather illuminating. There’s a lesson to be learned.\nAfter hearing that Jesus the Nazarene was passing by, the blind man—named Bartimaeus according to the parallel account in Mark’s Gospel (see Mark 10:46)—began crying out for mercy. Much to the frustration of those around him, Bartimaeus persisted, not unlike a child who desperately wants something. The people tried to shush him, but he was having none of that. He kept on crying out.\nJesus heard the ruckus and commanded the man be brought to Him. Everyone reads Scripture’s tone just a little differently, but I read this interaction as that of a loving father to a son, essentially saying, “Use your words. What do you want?” To which the man answered, “‘Lord… I want to see’” (Luke 18:41).\nFunny, isn’t it? Wasn’t it obvious what Bartimaeus wanted? Jesus could clearly see the situation for what it was. But He also knew that to give this man his sight back was also to give him a world of new responsibilities. No longer could Bartimaeus beg to get by. He’d have to work. A blind man is no one’s apprentice, and therefore has no skills. A blind man owns no property, no land to till. In the ancient world, a blind man got by on the compassion of others. Jesus wanted to know: “Is being made whole what you really want? Use your words.” Gracious as Jesus is, He gave this man a choice.\nIt’s a lesson we continue to learn over the course of our lives. The consistently loving voice of our Father saying, “Use your words. Tell me what you want.”\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

Everyone from celebrities to professional athletes to cultural gurus are praising the benefits of being thankful. Gratitude is showing up these days in long-form essays, evening news reports, popular podcasts, and conferences as a positive factor for everything from the quality of our hearts to the clarity of our minds to getting a good night’s sleep.\nThe medical and psychological community has been studying gratitude and its effects for well over a decade now. Studies have shown that gratitude can improve blood-vessel function, lower the risk of heart failure, take the edge off chronic pain, and lessen the effects of depression. The emphasis there is on the word can. As usual, there are always other factors involved (environment, heredity, physical activity), and so it’s difficult to prove conclusively the positive side effects of gratitude. But there are definitely enough testimonies to help us think it’s cool to be grateful.\nOne specific area researchers are now studying is the significance of our gratitude’s focus. In other words, the importance of who or what we are thanking.\nAs Jesus made His way to Jerusalem, He encountered ten lepers. Their cry was common to Jesus’s ears: “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us” (Luke 17:13). Jesus did, and as they went on their way, they were healed. One out of the ten turned back to focus on the target of his gratitude: Jesus, the Master. Luke tells us this Samaritan man, a foreigner, “fell facedown at his feet, thanking him.” Jesus told him, “Get up and go on your way. Your faith has saved you” (vv.16,19).\nDid the Samaritan experience physical healing from his leprosy? Scripture says he did. From that moment on, did he also experience improved blood circulation, more meaningful personal relationships, and a better night’s sleep? Well, Scripture doesn’t say. But what Jesus does tell us is that the Samaritan received salvation, possibly the greatest health benefit one could hope or ask for in this life.\nWhy didn’t the other nine men go back and thank Jesus? We don’t know. We only know they didn’t. But one, a Samaritan, turned back and said, “Thank you.” His gratitude earned him a place in the biblical record, and we’re still talking about him to this day. Whether or not it’s cool to be grateful shouldn’t really be our focus, for what’s cool changes with the weather. What we know for certain is that it’s good to be grateful, very good indeed.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

Most of us have some pictures of success we measure ourselves against. And unless you’ve been living under the proverbial rock or off the literal grid, at least one of those pictures probably looks like money. Sure, there are obviously other metrics, such as health, the presence of family and friends, and job satisfaction, but it seems none of us can shake the one known as wealth. We look around at those who seem to have it together financially and conclude they’ve got it made.\nThere’s nothing new under the sun, including this particular notion. This approach to life has been around about as long as this world has, and it’s not going away anytime soon. Wealth is a common measuring stick for the kingdoms of this world. However, that is not so in the kingdom of God.\nJesus tells two parables in Luke 16, both beginning with a common line: “There was a rich man…” (vv.1,19). But the two parables take different tracks from there. The first appears to praise a shrewd steward who uses money to gain favor, though it’s not the man’s questionable ethics Jesus wants us to emulate; it’s his attitude toward money. The man in the parable sees wealth as a means to an end. He uses it to secure his future. In the same way, you and I are to use everything at our disposal with an eye to our future—eternity with the Lord. In telling this parable, Jesus raises a caution: “So if you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will trust you with what is genuine?” (Luke 16:11). True riches. Genuine wealth. The kind that ultimately matters.\nThe second parable presents a radical reversal of the way things are: it’s the poor and forgotten who end up with a place at the table in God’s kingdom. The rich, who enjoyed luxury in this world (wearing purple and fine linen, and living in splendor every day), are left out in the world to come. They used money to benefit themselves instead of using it to serve God.\nAlthough Jesus’s parables initially diverge somewhat, they both arrive back at the same conclusion: “You cannot serve both God and money.” His point is that money is not necessarily a bad thing, but we must remember where our hope lies. Jesus said, “No one can serve two masters, since either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. ” (Matthew 6:24).\nIt is interesting to note who was listening to Jesus tell these parables on that day. Luke tells us it was the Pharisees, who were “lovers of money” (Luke 16:14), men who believed they could pledge their allegiance to both money and God.\nTrue riches. Genuine wealth. The kind that ultimately matters and is really the only metric for our lives is trust in the King of the coming kingdom. That’s how we have it made.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

It’s somewhat old-fashioned. However, chances are good you’ve got an idea what it means. You might even hear a particular voice in your head when you read it. I know I do.\nThe voice comes from a character in a certain black-and-white movie that plays every December, often multiple times throughout the season: It’s A Wonderful Life. He’s Mr. Potter, the bitter, old banker and the foil for the younger, idealistic George Bailey played by Jimmy Stewart. After George comes up short in a bank deposit, Mr. Potter tells him in quite the self-righteous voice, “Why don’t you go to the riff-raff you love so much and ask them to let you have $8,000?” The riff-raff, the lower classes, those of questionable reputation, the good-for-nothings. Or to use another word, sinners.\nAnd the Pharisees and scribes were complaining, \n“This man welcomes sinners and eats with them” (Luke 15:2).\nLuke 15 is usually recognized as the chapter that includes Jesus’s parable of the prodigal son. In actuality, that is just one of three parables in the chapter, each having to do with someone or something lost—a sheep, a coin, and a son. The lost sheep and lost coin are fairly neutral examples, but that last parable gets specific for those listening. The younger son who took his inheritance and ran off to spend it foolishly in a distant land is clearly the one who is lost. He is a prime example of the riff-raff, a sinner.\nBut the genius of Jesus comes into play as He introduces a third character in that familiar parable: the older brother, the brother who had done everything right, the one who always played by all the rules. That description in many ways fits the Pharisees and scribes listening to Jesus. They would never have considered themselves a part of the riff-raff they so despised, sinners like those Jesus welcomed and ate with. But Jesus’s parable reveals both brothers were lost. The younger knew his lostness, while the older did not. His self-righteousness left him blind to his own need of rescue. That same self-righteousness blinded the Pharisees and scribes. They were lost and didn’t know it.\nJesus’s parable tells us we’re all riff-raff, every one of us. Make no mistake—God loves us and is running toward us to wrap us in his love and forgiveness. But we’re all sinners who have fallen short of his glory. Any righteousness (right-ness) we have doesn’t come from us, but from our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\nStaying lost in self-righteousness leads to bitterness, but recognizing our lostness is an important step to being found and welcomed home.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    For many years, I drove past a massive, half-finished resort and hotel on my way to work. Situated in a nice, up-and-coming part of town, this structure was always a bit of a mystery to me. I wondered, How did they start this thing, get so far, and then just leave it here?\nAs it stood, it was more than a bit of an eyesore, a noticeable mar on an otherwise beautiful skyline. Even though it had great potential and was located in a great spot, it was left vacant, dilapidated, and unused. I heard that the developer and builder had dramatically underestimated the financial burden and had been forced to abandon the project during a tough economic season. They had failed to properly weigh the cost.\nLuke 14:27 is a sobering challenge from Jesus to correctly weigh the cost of following Him. Like the builders who abandoned that building before they’d finished, those who set out to follow Jesus without really understanding the all-encompassing nature of their commitment are in trouble.\nThe teachings of Jesus in Luke 14:25–33 can sound a bit gruff or perhaps even harsh. However, they served as a compassionate wake-up call to some of His followers, those anticipating a cushy role in Jesus’s kingdom. It was the common expectation of many first-century Jews that the Messiah would overthrow Rome and restore the self-rule and peace of Israel, bringing prosperity and comfort back to the land. For someone in the crowds with that expectation, the idea of dying to self would’ve made little sense.\nWe don’t have the same messianic expectations of Jesus that His first listeners did, but we sometimes expect that following Jesus will open doors to comfort, prosperity, and easy living. While following Jesus is certainly the most purposeful pursuit, and while there are certainly seasons of joy and celebration along the way, we need to be prepared to daily hoist our own crosses.\nMy prayer today is that the Spirit of God would give us the wisdom to accurately assess the cost of following Jesus, and then that we would wholeheartedly commit to the journey before us, regardless of personal sacrifice. Let us have the foresight to finish the building God has called us to build, not for our glory, but for the sake of His kingdom and life the of world to come.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

In reality there were probably only twenty to thirty students in that line, but at seven years old, the back of that line felt miles away from your destination—especially if that destination was recess. Oh, the coveted position of “line leader.” Whether chosen for this spot based on some merit or because you happened to be the first to rush to the door, it was the position to have.\nYou might think we grow out of this way of thinking, but have you ever seen people line up to board a plane? How about for a sporting event or a concert, or even worse, a Black Friday sale? As Ricky Bobby’s father famously quipped, “If you ain’t first, you’re last!” I would humbly suggest that the desire to be first, to be at the front, to be at the top, really never goes away. Sure, it looks differently today than it did in grade school, but it can still be a driving force in our lives.\nLuke 13:30 is perhaps one of the most famous teachings of Jesus: “Note this: Some who are last will be first, and some who are first will be last.” Most people are aware of it in some form or another, even if they’re not active readers of Scripture. It’s one of those sticky, memorable sayings.\nBut our key verse for today is more than a nice slogan for a bumper sticker. You see, Luke 13 is all about the kingdom of God. Each of Jesus’s teachings, interactions, and healings in this chapter tells us something unique about what the kingdom is like.\nJesus isn’t merely teaching us to be nice to one another. He’s revealing a key component of the kingdom; elbowing for a prime spot at the table won’t get you where you think it will. This teaching of Jesus was designed to challenge the expectations of His hearers, and it should have the same effect on us today.\nWe live in a day and age that loves a good underdog story: Rudy, Rocky, the Karate Kid, etc. Not so in the honor-and-shame-driven world of the ancient world. Honor for leaders came from being at the front of the line and staying there. Jesus flips this way of thinking on its head. Instead of reinforcing a front-of-the-line approach to the kingdom, He suggests that the humility and charity of the “line-lagger” would actually generate more influence and eternal impact. The kingdom is built on humility and selflessness, knowing that God is the one to lift people up.\nEven if you’ve given yourself over to a life of following Jesus, the temptation will be to jockey for power, measure yourself against your neighbor, and race to the front of the line. Jesus’s teaching for today encourages you to work hard and intentionally, but also to work humbly and charitably. My friends, this is tough, but let’s link arms in prayer and in encouragement as we embark on a journey to the back of the line.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

She was eventually caught and sent to a concentration camp. Perhaps you’ve read some of her story in her most well-known book, The Hiding Place.\nIf anyone had cause to suffer recurring worry and fear, it was Corrie. Before her arrest, every moment of every day was precarious. Would her neighbors figure out what was going on? Would they rat her out to the authorities? Would the police show up at her door? What if she couldn’t get enough food to care for everyone in her home? After her capture, her world was wrought with pain and suffering. She was left wondering if each day might be her last. Would she be further tortured? Would she be executed? What special horrors awaited her tomorrow?\nWhat’s amazing, though, is that while she endured some incredibly difficult days, she held onto hope and trusted in God’s provision. On worry and fear, she famously said: “Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow. It empties today of its strength.”\nFor most of us, our current level of stress is nowhere near what Corrie’s should have been. But, if I’m honest, I must admit there have been times in my life when I’ve been so consumed by my preparations for tomorrow that I’ve completely missed the joy of today. I’m willing to wager I’m not alone in that.\nWhat’s interesting about Luke 12 is that Jesus’s audience was facing many of the same issues we face today: civil and social unrest, economic uncertainty, extreme political divisiveness, and the whole gamut of personal traumas and tragedies. Jewish life under Roman rule was incredibly difficult and could be unpredictable. Still, Jesus invited His hearers to “consider the ravens” and “consider the wildflowers”(vv.24,27)—to trust God with the future.\nPerhaps we should consider taking Jesus up on His invitation today. No matter how disorienting our world might be, let us seek first the kingdom of God, not because all our problems will magically disappear, but because we have every reason to trust God. The burden of trying to control tomorrow is too great to bear, and any sense of real control over the future is an illusion. Let’s release that false sense of control to the Lord today, and regardless of our circumstances, let’s embrace peace that is beyond all understanding (Philippians 4:7).\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

Regardless of the location, we’re all familiar with the sentiment; giving lip service to something is always easier than actually giving it life service.\nWhen reading Luke chapter 11, I’ve always found Jesus’s response to the woman in the crowd a bit curious. She gives a shout-out to His mother, Mary, and in turn, Jesus seems to give her a hard time. Instead of offering agreement, Jesus seems to toss out a bit of a zinger: “Do you even know how to follow the Word of God?” (v.28, my paraphrase).\nHonestly, I began to think that Jesus’s response was bit of a non-sequitur. The woman points out something over here, and He speaks to something over there—almost as if He’s speaking an aside, talking beyond their encounter. But Jesus was not ignoring the woman or teaching above her understanding. Rather, He was using her declaration as a teachable moment, giving the perfectly tailored, most loving response to her statement. She declares, “Blessed is the womb that bore you,” and essentially, He counters with, “Blessing doesn’t come from being my mom. Instead, it comes from following the Word of God” (again, my paraphrase).\nIn other words, yes, Mary preformed a special role as the mother of Jesus. But we, too, can all walk in blessed intimacy and relationship with God because of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. He invites and enables us to not only be hearers of the Word, but doers (James 1:22).\nCertainly, there is an emphasis on faithfulness in the doing. If God has placed something on your heart, and the Scriptures confirm it, make sure you do it! But there is also an emphasis on the blessedness; it is possible for each of us to experience a blessed life in God this side of eternity.\nThe Word of God is easier read than done. But our job is to commit ourselves wholeheartedly to the doing, as an outpouring of our belief and trust in Jesus Christ. If you’ve come to trust and know Him, your eternity lies in His hands, but He still invites you to participate in His blessing now. Relationship with Jesus does not guarantee a safe, easy life—quite the opposite, really (John 16:33)—but it does mean that we get to participate in the kingdom as it invades this world here and now.\nHopefully, Jesus’ declaration feels like more of an invitation to you than an obligation. If the Word requires something of you that you’re not doing, pray for the courage to do it! If the Word requires you to leave something behind, pray for the perseverance to leave it! That is the intersection of obedience and blessing.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Imagine the busiest intersection you pass through each day on your morning commute. Now, imagine one day you show up at about 7:30 a.m., park your car on the side of road, and start directing traffic—though, the traffic light is in perfect working order, mind you. With no prior training or experience, you just walk out into the middle of the road and begin pointing and waving and motioning like crazy.\nIt wouldn’t take long for drivers to begin to realize that you have no idea what you are doing. Who does this guy think he is? Though your impact on traffic patterns and the safety of countless individuals would be immediate, without any real authority, the chances of you affecting any positive influence are approximately zero.\nThe situation would have an entirely different outcome if you were to roll in during rush hour to find the traffic light down, but a trained officer there to carefully and meticulously bring order to an otherwise dangerously chaotic situation. In that situation, you and everyone else on the road would be thankful for their expertise.\nJesus’s teachings in Luke 10 would’ve presented a series of radical paradigm shifts for His initial listeners. Between commissioning the seventy-two, describing unrepentant cities, and offering up a shocking definition of the term “neighbor” in His parable of the good Samaritan— Jesus was really rocking the boat big time.\nI imagine some of His Jewish listeners were left wondering, Who does this guy think He is? How dare He diminish our cities in comparison to the unrighteous and licentious Gentile cities! How dare He diminish the Levites and priests in favor of a foreign and unclean Samaritan!\nAt first glance, Jesus’s declaration of oneness with the Father in verses 21–24 might come across as informative, sure, but perhaps unrelated to what comes before and what follows after. But this passage’s placement could not be more intentional.\nUnlike you or I trying to direct traffic with no authority, no training, and no positive impact, Jesus enters the intersection of human history to bring order to the chaos. When He says, “All things have been entrusted to me by my Father” (v.21), He’s not just making a profound theological statement; He’s declaring His authority.\nJesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and shared openly about His unique relationship with the Father as a statement of divinity and invitation. He was quick to unequivocally answer the question, Who does this guy think he is? He’s the Son of God, and no one can know the Father except through His Son.\nIt may not be hard for us to accept some of the difficult teachings of Jesus in Luke 10. That’s largely because we don’t have the same social or cultural background as His initial audience. These days, those instructions can be challenging to enact, but we don’t typically reject them at face value.\nThat said, I’d be willing to wager that the teachings of Jesus challenge each of us in other ways. We might not be prone to wonder, Who does this guy think he is? Rather, perhaps we’re quick to assume some of His teachings no longer apply to us these days. My prayer for each of us in those moments is that we’d remember Jesus is directing traffic for a reason. If we want to know the Father, we have to put our lives under Jesus’s loving course correction.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

Throughout the discussion, he talked about how various worship services, camps, small groups, and prayer meetings provided “jolts,” “pick-me-ups,” and “shots in the arm” for him. His basic view of the Christian life, and one that many Christians share, is that of traveling from mountain top to mountain top, constantly in search of the next exhilarating spiritual experience to keep him going.\nFor those of us reared in evangelical youth groups and college ministries, we are familiar with this exhausting rollercoaster of soaring heights and crushing lows. Thankfully, today’s readings point us to a better and more realistic way of growing and living in Christ.\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke all follow Peter’s confession of Jesus as the Messiah with the transfiguration. In this famous episode, Jesus took Peter, James, and John with Him up to the top of a mountain. Then, He shone brilliant white before them. Moses and Elijah, the two great Old Testament prophets, appeared, and the disciples heard the Father say, “This is my Son, the Chosen One, listen to him!” (Luke 9:35). If there was any doubt left for these men about Jesus’s identity, this surely cleared up the confusion.\nJesus’s face shone brightly, and Peter, James, and John saw its brilliance without any covering, filter, or shade. They beheld Him as He truly was. Contrast this with the experience of the Israelites. Moses’s face would shine so brightly whenever He met with the Lord that he found it necessary to wear a veil for the sake of the people. The brightness was just too much for them (Exodus 34:33–34).\nIn 2 Corinthians chapter 3, Paul wrote, “We all with unveiled faces, are looking as in a mirror at the glory of the Lord and are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory; this is from the Lord who is the Spirit” (v.18). We, like Jesus, and like Moses before Him, have met with the Lord. As a result, we shine brightly with unveiled faces. Our hearts are new, and now we behold Christ in all His glory. We see Him in both His majestic power and His unparalleled compassion. And as we behold who Christ is, marveling at His greatness, God works in us to transform us, little by little, into the image of glory that belongs to Christ.\nThis process does not often take place in giant leaps and bounds, but incrementally. Little by little, as we repent of sin, hear God’s words, and obey them, the Spirit trims off the rough edges of our old lives and shapes us into molds of Christ’s character. We don’t need another mountaintop, because we get to experience the glory of Christ every day through the presence of His Spirit within us, making us more like Him. Thanks be to God.\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

Many argue that any attempt to convince a person to change their religion constitutes the most egregious of social errors. They find it to be cruel, condescending, and arrogant. However, Christians usually have a simple response to these criticisms: Every person needs to hear about Jesus.\nIn Luke chapter 9, there is a key turning point in Jesus’s ministry (vv.18–20). After feeding the five thousand, Jesus asked His disciples what the crowds were saying about Him. The disciples responded by cycling through some of the more popular answers regarding His identity. This wasn’t hard for them to do, as rumors were no doubt circling among the crowds.\nThen Jesus did something remarkable; He turned the casual conversation about what the crowds were saying into one that was intensely personal. “‘But you,’ he asked them, ‘who do you say that I am?’” Jesus took the conversation to an uncomfortable and awkward place, but it led to an important moment. “Peter answered, ‘God’s Messiah’” (v.20).\nUltimately, every person must wrestle with the same question Jesus asked His disciples. The gospel makes a universal demand: to be saved, we must believe. Yet, it also makes a universally gracious offer: any person, regardless of background, race, gender, or socio-economic status, may be saved.\nIn Romans 10, Paul reminded the Roman church of the simplicity of the gospel; a person has only to believe (v.9). We do not have to untangle difficult creedal formulas or perform a series of progressively more difficult good works. Rather, God saves through simple faith in His Son, Jesus Christ. “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Acts 2:21).\nEvery person who believes in Jesus has the incredible privilege of knowing Him, of taking up the daily cross, of following Him into kingdom work God has established for us to do. We join in the task of ensuring that everyone has heard the message of the gospel. Jesus sends some around the world to share this message. He sends countless others into their neighborhoods, ball fields, gyms, schools, and grocery stores to love, befriend, serve, and share in Jesus’s name.\nToday, let us join in this mission by praying that God would give us opportunities to share the good news. Let us live our lives with gospel intentionality, looking for ways to speak about the graciousness of our God and the gift of His Son.\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    This past Sunday I heard a sermon that was based on a text, one I myself had read many times before and had even preached on once. During the sermon, my pastor said nothing all that new to me, but throughout the sermon, I kept thinking, I needed to be reminded of that. For some of us, it may be rare to hear something truly new in a sermon or a Bible study, but we still need frequent reminders of what we already know because we are prone to forget.\nYou don’t have to read biblical history long to realize that God’s people were forgetful. They often forgot about His provision, His promises, and His power. Think of the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings. They grumbled about not having enough food or water not long after He had delivered them from Egypt and led them across the Red Sea on dry land. How could they think the Father would bring them out of bondage only to abandon them in the desert?\nJesus’s disciples evidenced this same forgetfulness in Luke 8. On a boat trip across the Sea of Galilee, a great storm came upon their small ship. Several experienced fishermen were aboard; the fact they, with all their experience, were fearful, proves the powerful nature of the storm. Despite the storm, Jesus was asleep in the boat. The disciples rushed to wake Him, telling Him they were going to die.\nThink about the miracles the disciples had witnessed in the previous chapter. Jesus healed the centurion’s servant, not by placing His hands on the man but by speaking a word from miles away. In the next narrative, Jesus raised a widow’s son from death. So with those miracles in their very recent memories, why would the disciples think a storm was beyond Jesus’s control?\nIt’s easy for those of us who know the end of the story to find fault with the disciples’ fear. When you know how the exodus ends, it’s easy to shake our heads in disbelief at whiny Israelites. However, at some point, we need to stop, think, and realize we are just like those Israelites and Jesus’s disciples. We complain when God doesn’t run the world according to our dictates, and we shake in fear with uncertainty about the future. The Israelites complained with hunger after the Red Sea parting, and the disciples were filled with terror over a storm even though they’d witnessed miracle after miracle—but really, we are no different. We grumble and shake after knowing Jesus died and rose again.\nJesus could just as easily ask us the same question He asked of His disciples: “Where is your faith?” (Luke 8:25). When tempted to grouse about our circumstances or fear for the future, our first responsibility is to remember what we already know. We must look to the cross of the Lord Jesus and His resurrection from the dead. We must look to what we know of biblical history. There we will find God working for the good of His people. Having remembered who He is and what He has done, we can take heart and face the future with forward-looking joy.\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt had a meeting scheduled with the well-known African-American academic, Booker T. Washington. On a whim, Roosevelt decided to make the meeting a dinner and quickly rushed an invitation over to Washington. Washington accepted, and the two men dined at the White House. When news of the dinner became public, a furor erupted. Many in southern America fumed at the news of the president inviting a black man to dine at his table. One news editor even quipped that by issuing the invitation, President Roosevelt insinuated that black men were equal to white men.\nWhen you welcome a person to your table, you invite them into the life of your family. It is an invitation to relationship. Meals in Jesus’s day were intimate affairs. People often reclined at the table, resting on one arm while eating with the other. In Luke 7, we read about a meal Jesus and His disciples had with Simon the Pharisee. While they were gathered together at Simon’s house, a woman with a notorious reputation came in and made a beeline for Jesus. Would He welcome her or would He do what any self-respecting man in His day would have done and send her back out of the door?\nHer appearance caused quite a scene, not only because of her reputation, but also because of her actions. She brought an alabaster jar of perfume with her, which she used to anoint Jesus’s feet. Then she kissed those feet and wiped them with her hair. Her actions were extraordinary acts of worship and hospitality. Jesus’s host offered Him none of the customary acts of hospitality, yet this woman, out of her great love for Jesus, offered them to Him at great expense and without regard to the awkward scene it created.\nJesus explained her actions and those of the Pharisee. She had been forgiven much, so she loved much. He had been forgiven little, so he loved little. Then Jesus looked at the woman and told her, “Your sins are forgiven” (Luke 7:48). Jesus’s boldness caused His dinner companions to wonder, “Who is this man who even forgives sins?” (v.49).\nWith four little words, Jesus taught His dinner companions an important truth about Himself; He has the power to forgive sins. In one simple statement, Jesus affirmed His divinity, but also offered good news: forgiveness is available for even the “worst” of sinners. No matter how far we’ve stumbled. No matter how far we’ve wandered from the Father’s heart, forgiveness is available through Jesus.\nForgiveness breeds change. It beckons us to treat people the same way we have been treated by the Father because of the gospel. We forgive the wrongs we experience at the hands of others, because we know the joy of being freely forgiven. Since we know what it is to be welcomed into the family of God, we spread a table, warmly welcoming others into our lives that they might know life in the Father’s family too.\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    “These people approach me with their speeches \nto honor me with lip-service—\nyet their hearts are far from me, \nand human rules direct their worship of me.”\n– Isaiah 29:13\nWhen the Lord spoke these words through the prophet Isaiah, He was not confronting a new problem or speaking about a phenomena that would magically disappear when Jesus came into the world. As a species plagued with sin and living in a fallen world, human beings tend to value the form of religion rather than the heart behind it.\nJesus came face to face with this tendency from the early days of His ministry. He challenged it, and in doing, so inflamed some of His opponents who wanted to put Him to death. In one incident, recorded in Luke 6, the Pharisees criticized Jesus because His disciples were picking heads of grain to eat on the Sabbath (vv.1–5). In the same chapter, but on another Sabbath, the Pharisees became “filled with rage” because Jesus healed a man with a withered hand (vv.6–11).\nIn the controversy over the heads of grain, Jesus pointed the Pharisees to the actions of David in 1 Samuel chapter 21. While on the run from Saul, David went into the house of God where he and his men ate the consecrated bread. David’s actions showed that human need trumps strangling legalism. If David’s men could eat the consecrated bread on the Sabbath, then how much more could the Son of David’s disciples fill their bellies with unconsecrated heads of grain on the Sabbath?\nJesus made another startling claim in this discussion about the Sabbath, saying that He, the Son of Man, is “Lord of the Sabbath” (v.5). Think about this statement for a second. In Genesis 2, we read that God created the seventh day as a day of rest, the Sabbath day (v.2). In claiming to be “Lord of the Sabbath,” Jesus announced to His enemies that, at the very least, He had authority over that which the Father created and ordained.\nJesus further exposed the Pharisees’ glaring hypocrisy when He healed a`man with a withered hand on the Sabbath. Instead of rejoicing that this poor man had regained the use of his hand, the Pharisees became filled with righteous fury. Then, in their indignation over Jesus’s supposed violation of the fourth commandment, they began plotting in their hearts to break the sixth (Luke 6:6–11).\nLest we think we are wholly unlike the Pharisees, James, the brother of our Lord, painted a picture in his letter that could be a scene in one of our own churches (see James 2:1–4). Whenever we discount the poor and the vulnerable while celebrating the rich, the powerful, and the well-connected, we are honoring the Father with our lips while our hearts are far from Him.\nThe Lord of the Sabbath showed unparalleled compassion in each of His Sabbath healings. Shouldn’t those of us who gather in His name welcome the weak, the powerless, the broken, and the poor in His name? He is present through the Holy Spirit, who enters into the hearts of His people, and He is present with us when we gather together. Since we are His, we ought to welcome those He would welcome.\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

Everyone wanted a piece of Him, but few truly knew Him.\nIn the early stretch of Jesus’s earthly ministry, He couldn’t walk into the towns around Galilee without crowds gathering and pressing in around Him (Luke 5:15). They wanted to hear Him teach. They wanted to touch Him. They wanted to see Him perform miracles, maybe even one for them. It was everyone too—men and women, young and old, religious leaders, government officials, tax collectors, and sinners.\nLuke chapters 5 through 9 focus on this period of time when Jesus was famous. After this He became persona non grata among the religious establishment. But chapters 5 through 9 cover the days of the Sermon on the Mount, the feeding of the 5,000, and fascinating little vignettes like the one we find in today’s reading about a paralytic who was lowered down through a roof by his friends in the hope that Jesus might heal him.\nThese men really did believe Jesus could heal their paralyzed friend, though it is likely they had limited insight into who Jesus truly was. His fame had reached them. They’d heard stories of His supernatural abilities. But they couldn’t have known they were seeking the Son of God.\nIn our culture today, we often treat Jesus in this way. We focus on what He might be able to do for us without considering who He is to us. For the paralytic’s friends, Jesus saw their act of determination as a genuine expression of faith. He healed the man and commended their faith, even forgiving the man’s sins (Luke 5:20). They had so little to go on, and yet they acted.\nI always wonder what came of people like this—people who went to Jesus with a measure of faith and then saw Him command the laws of nature: blind Bartimaeus (Mark 10:46); the woman with the issue of blood (Luke 8); the paralytic by the pool of Bethesda (John 5). I wonder how many of these people who came to Jesus with embryonic faith in God but were delivered as true, eternal believers.\nWhen we come to Jesus in faith, we always come with a short-sighted grasp of who He truly is. We can’t help that entirely, since we remain earthbound creatures contemplating the divine. But we have much more insight into who Jesus is than this paralytic and his friends because we have the remaining sixteen chapters of Luke’s Gospel to inform us.\nIt would be a shame if the best thought we ever had about Jesus was that He could help us out from time to time. It would be a tragedy of misplaced affection if the only time we ever went to Him was when we wanted a miracle. It is good for us to come to Jesus in faith like the paralytic and his friends, but as we read on, I pray the Holy Spirit would give us eyes to see who Jesus truly is—the Savior who is Christ the Lord. May this be what truly amazes us.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The gospel is an “accept or reject” proposition. It’s either completely true or categorically false. Jesus makes sure of this.\nAfter Jesus’s temptation in the wilderness, He began ministering in and around Galilee. People did not realize it, but the Messiah was in their midst. They caught glimpses of it through events like those we see here in Luke 4. He spoke like a man with an uncommon grasp of God’s law. He cast out demons with authority. He cared for the indigent and afflicted, miraculously healing them.\nThough those in positions of religious authority could not explain where Jesus got the power and wisdom to do and teach as He does, they were very reluctant to accept what He says so plainly in this chapter—that He is the fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy:\nThe Spirit of the Lord is on me,\nbecause he has anointed me\nto preach good news to the poor.\nHe has sent me\nto proclaim release to the captives\nand recovery of sight to the blind,\nto set free the oppressed,\nto proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor (Luke 4:18–19).\nCan you picture the scene—Jesus reading these words, carefully rolling up the scroll, allowing for a nice dramatic pause, and then saying in reference to Himself, “Today as you listen, this Scripture has been fulfilled” (Luke 4:21). Why do you think people had such a difficult time believing Him? Clearly He wasn’t simply talking big. People were beginning to observe His wisdom and power. And the miracles too.\nI see two kinds of people in this chapter: people who are trying to hold things together, and people who are so desperate for help they’re willing to risk having their assumptions challenged. What was happening then continues today. Jesus makes claims, does things, and has events attributed to Him—most notably, His own resurrection from the dead—that require us to either dismiss Him or become open to the possibility that He is who the angel told the shepherds He would be in chapter 2: the Savior who is Christ the Lord.\nThe message of the angels is coming into sharper focus here in chapter 4. Captives are being set free. The blind are recovering their sight. And the good news of the possibility of this sort of restoration is spreading.\nThroughout the rest of Luke’s Gospel, people will struggle to believe in Jesus. The struggle continues to this day for many. Perhaps it does for you. If so, ask the Lord to open your heart to the possibility of believing what you never imagined possible—that Jesus Christ heals the blind, frees the captives and oppressed, and ushers in a new kingdom, over which He will rule forever, world without end. He either will or He won’t.\nHe says He will.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    How real is your faith? Is it anchored in reality? Were you made for a relationship with God? Do you need forgiveness? Is there hope for sinners? Does any of this matter? These are some of the questions Luke wants us to tangle with.\nThe third chapter of Luke’s Gospel really drives home his earlier statement that this book would be an “orderly account” of the life of Jesus. The chapter opens with an historical point of reference—the 15th year of the reign of Caesar Tiberius, when Pilate, Philip, and Lysanias were all tetrarchs, and Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests—and it ends with a genealogy that reaches all the way back to the first man, Adam.\nThis stuff really happened. That’s something Luke wants us to know. He is not telling fables, parables, or fantasy. He is writing truth. We are reading truth. This chapter marks the beginning of Jesus’s earthly ministry. No one knows who He is yet. There are rumors floating around that some believe the Messiah has been born, but few have zeroed in on Jesus as the Christ. \nLuke sets us up for this chapter by telling us in the chapters before about the miraculous nature of John the Baptist’s birth—coming from old, barren parents and leaping in Elizabeth’s womb in the presence of the pregnant Mary. Now, John emerges as a man stepping out of the wilderness to do what he was born to do: proclaim the Messiah’s coming and call all people to repent. \nIt can be so easy to regard our spiritual ideas and habits as some sort of mystical soul-care that has little to do with our present reality. We can take on devotional practices because they make us feel better, or ease our consciences, or make us feel enlightened. And we can just as easily begin to treat our spirituality as something that belongs to another realm, serving as some kind of escape from the here and now.\nBut the Gospels don’t treat faith in this way. Rather than being some ethereal concept floating in spiritual energy, Luke nails faith in Christ to the floor. He anchors it in real time, and sets it in real geography. Jesus did not come to inspire us. He came to live a life of perfect righteousness in our place, die the sinner’s death we deserve, and give us life in His name through His real cross and real resurrection. \nWhen John the Baptist came on the scene, he did not call us to positive thinking, or quiet times, or joining up with a social cause. He called us to repent and to believe in true forgiveness, made possible by the One more powerful than him (Luke 3:16). Forgiveness would come through the real, historical, atoning work of Jesus—which, again, really did take place during the reign of Tiberius, when Pilate, Philip, and Lysanias were all tetrarchs, and Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. \nReally. Do you believe it?\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    For you. Focus on these two words as you read: “A Savior was born for you” (Luke 2:11, emphasis mine). \nAn ordinary shepherd’s life was rich in irony. His job was to tend the animals that would be sacrificed to atone for the sins of the people. Yet because of his work, a shepherd was often ceremonially unclean. And because he was routinely unclean, he was sometimes seen by others as untrustworthy and irreligious. \nJesus said a good shepherd would lay down his life for his sheep (John 10:11)—sheep that would be sacrificed for the sins of the same people who regarded the shepherd as unclean. This reality made shepherds’ very lives a kind of sacrifice. They were outsiders.\nWhen the angel appeared outside of Bethlehem to these marginalized men keeping watch over their flocks, what did he say? In effect, he said, “Go behold the end of your life as an outsider.” Let’s unpack that.\nThe angel uses three names for Jesus—names that speak to His purpose. Savior means He will atone for the sins of the people. Christ identifies Him as their deliverer and Messiah. And Lord recognizes His divinity.  \nBut then the angel uses one more expression, which would have brought overwhelming clarity to the moment. The angel tells the shepherds that the Savior, Christ the Lord, has been born for them (Luke 2:11). The divine, atoning Messiah has been born for shepherds. They are not outsiders to this gift. They are recipients!  \nImagine it. An angel appears to some of the most disregarded people in the land to deliver the greatest announcement ever given. The glory of all glories appears to the lowest of the low, and he gives them a sign to prove Christ was born for them, a sign that would have left them speechless. The baby King would be lying in a manger. \nThe shepherds saw not only that He had come; they got a hint as to why. When they found Jesus there in a manger, just as the angel had said, the very location of His birth was drenched in meaning. The Savior was born into their unclean world and placed in a manger, a feeding trough for sheep. As the Good Shepherd, the Savior would lay down His life, and His body would be broken to feed His sheep.\nLike those shepherds, we are not outsiders to this gift either. We are called to receive Him who came into our unclean world, the Savior who is Christ the Lord. May we leave this text in the same way the shepherds left the manger—glorifying and praising God for these things we have seen.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

Think of the cultural moments that have risen and subsided, where the voices with the megaphones have demanded that we all believe this or reject that. It can be dizzying.\nIn Malcolm Muggeridge’s essay from 1980 entitled, “But Not of Christ,” the British journalist reflects on all that had happened in his own lifetime. England and America saw their economies flourish, then tank, and then flourish again. Hitler came along declaring the establishment of a German Reich that would last for 1,000 years. He died less than ten years later in infamy. Stalin’s countrymen hailed him as wiser than Solomon and more humane than Marcus Aurelius. Then his name became forbidden in the regime he helped found. Mussolini announced that he would restart the calendar to coincide with his reign. That didn’t work out so well either.\nMuggeridge ends his essay by saying, “Behind the debris of these self-styled, sullen supermen and imperial diplomatists, there stands the gigantic figure of one person, because of whom, by whom, in whom, and through whom alone mankind might still have hope. The person of Jesus Christ.”\nThe gospel of Luke begins with a strong assertion. Luke opens this book by telling the honorable Theophilus that he is writing an orderly account of the life of Jesus Christ. When he recounts the story of Jesus’s birth, he tells us, “his kingdom will have no end” (Luke 1:33). That is a bold statement.\nThese words were written 2,000 years ago, and they come to us in the context of Luke quoting an angel who was referencing the time of Jacob, which was several thousand years prior. These are impressive words to read. Why? Because in all this time, Luke’s Gospel has not collapsed in on itself. In fact, the message has spread around the world, and millions of people from hundreds of cultures have not only heard this gospel, they have surrendered their lives to the One it’s about: Jesus Christ.\nAs you read Luke’s Gospel, keep in mind that this is no ordinary book. Anyone can say their ideology, regime, or religion will last forever, but no one can actually make that happen. No one except for the King of the Universe. The gospel is about the King of the Universe—Jesus Christ, the Son of God and heir to the throne of David (v.32).\nThis is His story, and the very fact that you are reading Luke’s words is evidence that the story is ongoing. And that you are part of it. So read on.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

Capon observes, “It is in the ordinary that groans with the weight of glory.”\nOf course, we are naturally inclined to think the opposite—to expect that prominence, pomp, and power are the end goal, or even that they are the best evidences of spiritual achievement. But places of prominence are never for us. We are raised only that we may bow and serve. And service is seldom made of grand and recognizable gestures.\nChrist, newly risen from the dead, might have summoned angels to attend Him. He might have visited kings instead of fishermen. He might have ordered a spectacular banquet, rather than serve simple bread and cooked fish on the shore.\nThe Christ who ascended in glory was the same Christ who served breakfast on the beach, who stooped to serve. His glory was revealed perhaps most profoundly in the ordinariness of His ministry. I wonder, when we pray for God’s blessing, how many of us ask, “Lord, use me in ordinary ways.”\nYet that is what Jesus asks of Peter. “Do you love me? Then feed my lambs, tend my sheep, feed my sheep.” This was not a call to fame, but to lowliness.\nIf you’re like me, you may be saying, “Yes! Amen! That is precisely how I try to live! I try to serve God in the everyday things, in the little stuff.” \nIs that the truth? Or, do we like Peter, the moment after declaring our love for Christ, turn and wonder what God is doing in someone else and say, “Lord, what about this man?” How quickly our hearts run to competition and the desire for a place of special prominence. How often we use our oversight for shameful gain, rather than eagerly serving. \nHave we truly grasped the vision of the Kingdom of heaven? Capon further observes, “A man can do worse than to be poor. He can miss altogether the sight of the greatness of small things.”\nHow greatly we are indebted to Christ’s condescension, to the authority of His humility, to the glory of His servanthood! Lord, open our eyes to see the Kingdom. Cause our hearts to long for the blessedness of humility.\nJohn concludes his Gospel account with these words: “Now there are also many other things that Jesus did” (John 21:25). I tend to think of those “many other things” as grand displays of power, staggering miracles, and earth-shaking utterances. But I’m beginning to wonder if John is speaking of something else. How many words of love and kindness did Christ utter? How many meals humbly prepared? How many quiet stoopings? How many washings of feet? How many wiping of tears from the eyes? How many ordinary, plain, and small glories did He display? \n“Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written” (John 21:25). And a lot of them would probably appear very ordinary.\nWritten By Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

Believing in the resurrection of Jesus without seeing the proof was a tall order since, in his world, one hundred out of one hundred people died, and when they did, they tended to stay dead.\nBetween His resurrection and ascension, Jesus appeared in the flesh to over 500 of His followers (1 Corinthians 15:6). He appeared to Mary Magdalene and a few other women on Easter morning, and He appeared to Peter and John later that day (Luke 24:34; 1 Corinthians 15:5). That afternoon, Jesus appeared to two others walking to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-32). Then later that night, the other disciples, except Thomas, were in a room talking about what had happened to Jesus, and as they were talking, Jesus came and stood among them and bid them peace (Luke 24:36). Jesus showed them His scars and invited them to touch them to see He was real.\nThomas wasn’t there for any of that. Later, when he heard about it, he said that unless he could see the marks of the nails in Jesus’ hands and place his hand into Jesus’ side, he would never believe (John 20:25). It seemed unwise to go down such an impossible road. But eight days later Jesus appeared again to the disciples when Thomas was there, and said, “Put your hand in my side, Thomas. Don’t doubt, but believe” (John 20:27, paraphrased). Then Thomas saw Him and said, “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28).\nIf you were in Thomas’ shoes, would you have believed the disciples’ story without seeing the proof? Even though I might have wanted to, I don’t know that I could have.\nJohn’s Gospel was written with a purpose—to exist as proof of the resurrection of Jesus. He said, “These things are written so that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name” (John 20:31).\nWe’re given a different kind of proof, but proof nonetheless. In John’s Gospel, he shows us the risen Christ—but not simply with words alone. He gives us a testimony to a resurrection that has not been disproven, but rather has come to be embraced and celebrated by millions of people around the globe and down through time. It is such an incredible claim that it should have been easy to disprove if it were false. But that is not what has happened.\nInstead, the story of Jesus’ resurrection has led to the transformation of countless lives. Why? Because the evidences and eye-witnesses surrounding His resurrection were so numerous and consistent that people who came looking to find the whole thing to be a sham often ended up believing. And with believing comes life in Christ’s name. People are changed by the life and ministry of Jesus, not just intellectually but in every way imaginable.\nThe simple fact that Christianity—a faith built upon the resurrection of its founder—still exists, is a testament to its authenticity. \nWhat about you? Do you believe this?\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

Not so for Pilate and all the Jewish leaders gathered at Jesus’ midnight interrogation.\nJesus was crucified under a sign that mockingly read “King of the Jews.” To many who were present on that day, that sign was an indictment of Jesus’ failed earthly political revolution. Based upon their best understanding of Old Testament prophecy and the teachings that had been handed down to them, the Jews were expecting a political military revolutionary who would overthrow the oppressive Roman governance of Israel. They were hoping for a new King David; a heroic, military, warrior king.\nIt’s easier for us now to think of Jesus’ Kingdom in spiritual and future terms, but on the day of His arrest, we can see even by Peter’s behavior that many were expecting to take up arms to bring the Kingdom of God to earth. This of course was not Jesus’ way. It was such an unexpected moment when Jesus announced that His Kingdom was not of this world.\nWhat does this mean for us? It means that we, as Kingdom people, are experiencing portions of the Kingdom now, but that we also await its future and full arrival. Jesus’ death and resurrection inaugurated the Kingdom of God. Because of this we now live “in the world, but not of it.” It’s an odd ache, a disquieting tension that I’m willing to wager most of us have felt from time to time. We are “not of this world” people, living, working, and dwelling on this earth.\nC. S. Lewis described this sort of longing best in his book Till We Have Faces:\n“The sweetest thing in all my life has been the longing — to reach the Mountain, to find the place where all the beauty came from — my country, the place where I ought to have been born. Do you think it all meant nothing, all the longing? The longing for home? For indeed it now feels not like going, but like going back.”\nThat longing we possess is a sign that we are in the midst of a massive redemptive mystery. We stand in a moment between the resurrection of the Lord and His much anticipated final return. This moment is full of hardship, but also characterized by an immense sense of hope. To be “not of this world” means that you’re going to feel like a square peg in a round hole some days. Other times, it may just feel like an unquenchable wanderlust, or itchy feet. \nTravel is a wonderful thing, but our hunger for the right place—the most beautiful place, the place where we feel home and whole—is ever elusive. That’s because our King and His Kingdom are not of this world’s making. This can be hard to wrap our heads and hearts around, but we know it will be satisfying in an eternal and everlasting way when the Kingdom of God is fully realized. From then on, it will be all we ever know. But for now, because the coming Kingdom is real, we ache. May the longing be sweet.\nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Back when I was doing youth ministry, there was this one night I was teaching in Romans. There were many nights when I would teach and I would know I had their attention. They were with me and the Holy Spirit was moving among them. Something was happening and I knew it. Those were special nights.\nThis was not one of those nights. \nI knew I was not getting through, no matter how hard I tried. The metaphors fell flat and the examples were not connecting. I could hear their souls longing to reach for their phones. I was frustrated.\nWhat was I trying to get them to see? We were discussing the glory of God. And I was struggling to get them to understand what God’s glory was and why it was so important. And then something happened that I will never forget. This young girl leaning back in her chair spoke up and made it clear.\n“Do you mean His wonderfulness?”\nIn that one word she had made clear what I, the seminary-trained pastor, could not. And ever since, I have used her definition and that story when communicating what the glory of God means. Her definition holds up, even when I set it against those of the theologians throughout history.\nSo when I see Jesus in His “High Priestly Prayer” (which He prayed right before His arrest, death, and resurrection) say, “glorify Your Son, that the Son may glorify You,” I read Jesus’ words through the lens of that girl’s definition of glory.\nWhen Jesus prays that He would be glorified, He is praying that we would see His wonderfulness and that He would then, in turn, show off the wonderfulness of the Father to us. Now, if I were to pray this, that would be awful. My wonderfulness—if there is any—would not do you any good. It would be an arrogant prayer for me or any of us to pray. So why is it not arrogant for Jesus to pray this?\nBecause apart from us seeing Christ’s wonderfulness, we have no hope. We must see the wonderfulness of His perfect life. There are many wonderful things in His life to see, not the least of which is His perfect obedience to the Father and His ability to never sin. We must see the glory of His death. It is gruesome and tragic, but we must see the wonderfulness of how loved we are in His giving His life so that we could be saved from our biggest problem, our sin. And we must see the wonderfulness of the resurrection. Even though He was as dead as dead can be, He rose from the grave; and we are given the wonderful promise that because He rose, we will, too, if our faith is in Him.\nSee this in full wonder: when Jesus prays that we would see His wonderfulness, it is the most loving prayer He could have prayed. Wonder of wonders. May the Lord give us eyes to see the wonder of who He is.\nWritten By Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

The whole point is to stand in one spot, on “the mountain,” while opponents try to take it. They push, tackle, and bombard you, but if you stand your ground, you stay King of the Mountain—or usually a sewer manhole, a patch of dirt, or a couch. No alliances are allowed. No sharing of the hill. Only one king and only one mountain. Whoever is strong enough to endure reigns as king. It’s a cruel and crushing monarchy.\nDo you see how different the King of Mount Zion is? Jesus is the King of kings, and He doesn’t discourage anyone from standing with Him. He invites us. Christ welcomes poor sinners into His kingdom and into His majesty to share His reward.\nJesus came down from Heaven—chucking the King of the Mountain playbook—and died on a Roman torture device for sins He didn’t commit. But He didn’t lose His spot on the mountain. He rose from the dead and has been given a name above every name and a throne over the universe.\nJesus overcame. The devil couldn’t stop him. Even death’s grip wasn’t strong enough to keep Jesus from being the resurrected King of kings. Jesus outperformed and outlasted the greatest threats in the world, with sin and death being the loudest of them all. And He did this for you.\nIn Christ, you are with Him on the Mountain. “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? … No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 8:35, 37–39).\nIf your faith is in Christ, you have overcome the world because He overcame the world. Nothing shall separate you from Him—from His love or His power.\nWritten By J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In John 15, Jesus unfolds a familiar metaphor—He is the vine, we are the branches. What does this mean? People have taken this image to mean a lot of things. Some focus on how it highlights the nearness of Christ. Others may focus on how it promises that we will do amazing things for God as fruit-bearing branches. But Jesus’ focus of the metaphor is obedience. The Son cooperates with the Father, and then calls us to cooperate with Him.\nJohn 15:9 reads a little like a math story-problem. Solve for why we should obey: “As the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you. Remain in My love.” The sequence of our connection to Christ in this verse is important to see. As the Father has loved Christ, so Christ has loved us. For this reason we are called to remain in His love—because He has loved us as the Father has loved Him. Think about that. There is not a single degree of difference between the strength of God’s love for Christ and Christ’s love for us. Not even a hint.\nHow do we remain in a love like this? Jesus answered plainly in the chapter before: “If you love Me, you will keep My commands” (John 14:15). We remain in the love of Christ by obeying. Here is where we can go off the rails, though. Love precedes obedience. If you reverse that order, you lose the gospel. Obedience is not how we obtain Christ’s love. It is a response to it. \nTrue Christian obedience is always a response to the already-existing love of Christ, not an attempt to earn it. We love because He loved us.\nIf we love Jesus, the only response that makes any sense at all is to obey what He commands. If Jesus, the Son of God, came in the flesh for the purpose of living and dying in our place, then what command could He give us that would not be for our good? What bit of guidance could He issue that wouldn’t exist to strengthen the bond of our love for Him? Why would Christ call us to anything if it didn’t serve to strengthen our comprehension of the depth of His love for us?\nIt is God’s design that our lives would resemble Christ’s—that we bear fruit that shows Christ to others. This, Jesus tells us, brings glory to God—when our lives bear fruit that reveals Christ (John 15:8). What an amazing thought, that the commands of Christ are not given to be a burden (Matthew 11:30), but a path to freedom, peace, and an always deepening understanding of His love for us—which, in turn, reveals His love to others.\nBecause of all this, Jesus says, “Remain in me.” \nMay our obedience to Christ always be a response to His already-existing, never-failing love for us. And may our obedience—flawed and incomplete as it is—bring glory to Christ, to the delight of the Father.\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    We love expectations. Sometimes we love them more than reality. We can fantasize about what something might be like—that dream job, the relationship we have longed for, winning a big game, or simply a delicious meal. But our expectations also have the power to destroy, especially when they go unmet. \nWhen Jesus said, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6), His disciples were confused. Maybe they were expecting someone more religious-looking, or more physically respectable, or more professional. Philip replied, “Show us the Father, and that will be enough for us to believe” (v. 8). Jesus didn’t meet even His own disciples’ expectations. Even though they had the Son of God standing in front of them, there was a part of them that wanted more.\nWhen our expectations are not met, we begin to question whether something or someone is worth the effort. We call this doubt—a struggle to imagine a way, or a truth, or a life when things don’t go the way we expected.\nWhen Jesus says He is the way, He is calling us to a life we are not creative enough to expect. We are called, like His disciples, to allow the Author of life to rewrite our expectations. This rewriting is hard. It often involves pain, and it can seem like a never-ending process (which it is).\nWhen Jesus says He is the truth, He is calling us to lives we are not always honest enough to receive—the truth about God and about ourselves, the truth of grace and repentance, the truth about what is valuable and lovely. \nWhen Jesus says He is the life, He is calling us to embrace a reality of that cannot exist apart from Him.  \nJesus calls us to Himself. He is the way and the truth and the life. And as we read in John 14:2, He goes before us to prepare a place for us. Jesus loves His children enough to redeem us here and to lead us home. \nChild of God, whatever your broken expectations are, you are called by the One who lacks nothing. In Christ, you are redeemed. \nWritten By Jason Tippetts \n\n                ",

This task was typically performed by a servant who would stand at the door, washing the feet of his master’s guests as a gesture of hospitality. \nWhy is that information relevant? Because in John 13, Jesus does something radical. The Son of God in the flesh takes off His outer garments and kneels at the feet of His disciples so that He can wash their feet.\nJesus was showing the disciples that He is the servant of all. No matter the dirt and possible excrement on the feet of His disciples, Jesus washed them. Likewise, there is no sin so dirty in us that God cannot wash it away. \nIf Jesus is more than willing to stoop low to cleanse us, why do so many of us reject His humility and service on our behalf? John 13:8 gives us the answer to that question: “Peter said to Him, ‘You shall never wash my feet.’ Jesus answered him, ‘If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.’” Peter could not imagine Jesus stooping so low.\nLike Peter, we struggle to believe that we need Jesus to cleanse us. We think our cleansing is not the responsibility of the Son of God. Many of us accept the lie that our sin is too great for God to tolerate, so the cleansing of that sin becomes our responsibility. But that is not the gospel.\nThe good news of the gospel is that the nail-pierced hands of Jesus cleanse any and all sin away. This washing happens as a gift of grace to all who need to be made clean. In order for us to enter God the Father’s house after this long journey we call life, Jesus, the servant of all, comes to earth to wash the feet of His Father’s guests so that we might dine at His table. \nIt’s an open invitation.

From John 1:1 to the end, it’s obvious not only that Jesus is God, but that Jesus knows He is God.\nAt the same time, we see over and over again Jesus pointing to His Father, reminding people that the Father sent Him, that He speaks on behalf of the Father, that He’s an exact representation of the Father, and that He seeks only to glorify His Father. In short, the Father and His Son are both God, but there seem to be some similarities and differences between them. Both are said to have created the world, but we also know the Father didn’t die on the cross. As theologian Fred Sanders has said, “They are equal, but they are not each other.”\nWhy does this matter? John’s Gospel in general and John 12 in particular give us a peek into the life of our Trinitarian God. God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—one God in three persons. This is important to affirm because it’s important to know and understand God rightly (at least, as best we can with our limited humanity).\nJohn 3:16 tells us that God (the Father) sent His only Son (Jesus) to give us eternal life—the eternal life they share as God. As we will see in John 14, we also know that Jesus will send the Holy Spirit to remind us of Jesus’ words and to empower us to live Christlike lives. In other words, we see clearly that God loves us, and that He’s provided everything we need to be saved.\nIf a person believes in Jesus, he believes in the Father who sent Him (John 12:44). If a person believes in the Father and Son, he must believe in the Holy Spirit who will be sent to him. God the Father sent God the Son into the world, and God the Son sends God the Spirit into our hearts. And we know that through this faith, we have eternal life (John 12:50).\nGod has come into the world. He has come to save sinners. And He has come to live within us. May we say with the psalmist in Psalm 118:25, “Lord, save us!” We know that He wants to save us and that in Himself, He has given us all we need for salvation.

My daughter is talking, so I listen (sometimes—she talks a lot).\nJohn 11 turns on the word so. People brought Jesus word that His close friend Lazarus was deathly ill. You’d expect Him to drop everything and rush to Lazarus’s home, especially because Jesus could heal any illness. But He didn’t. The passage says, “so when He heard Lazarus was sick He stayed two more days.” What? Why? That seems insane or negligent or insanely negligent—even more so when Jesus said that the sickness would not lead to death. Of course it would if nobody healed him. But Jesus waited on purpose.\n“This sickness will not end in death but is for the glory of God that the Son of God may be glorified through it” (John 11:4). Those are Jesus’ words. Except Lazarus did die. And dead is dead, final, life over. Jesus could have stopped it, and Lazarus’s sisters knew it. Yet He intentionally waited to show up and then had the audacity to say Lazarus had “fallen asleep.”\nWhat was Jesus getting at? What did all this add up to? A display of both His full humanity and full deity, His deep connection to His friends and His power over all.\nWhen Jesus arrived in the town where Lazarus had lived, He walked into the pain of loss. Martha and Mary, Lazarus’s sisters, met Him and—as people do when they are overcome with pain and are grasping for answers—asked why Jesus hadn’t been there to heal their brother. “If you had been here,” they said. If. Jesus had stayed away on purpose. He had let Lazarus die.\nBut Jesus wept. How could He weep when He had allowed the pain to happen? Jesus wept over the loss of a friend and over the pain of death. He wept over the pervasive evil that steals life from everyone and the devastating effects of sin on the world. He wept for the pain of Martha and Mary. He wept because He was a man who deeply hurt.\nThen He showed why He’d waited, what that so was all about. “Lazarus, come forth,” He commanded. (John 11:43). Jesus gave death an order to depart, and it did. For a moment He pulled back the curtain and gave a glimpse into the resurrection to come, the impending death of death He would bring about by laying down His own life. \nIn that moment, in the midst of mourning, Jesus proved the hope that all His followers have, a hope greater than death.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

Sure, we hear about them at Christmastime, or we might catch a late-night PBS special on their pastoral ways, but other than that shepherds have no hold in our 2017 lives.\nSo when Jesus says, “I am the good shepherd” (John 10:11), that phrase poses a challenge for men today. We either tap the brakes and go back to a bygone era in our minds and see Jesus in that same vein (somewhat removed from today), or we hit the gas and speed up to hopefully imagine something more relevant for right now. But what if we focused on the adjective in that statement instead of the noun? Not that the noun isn’t important, because it is. But today’s text doesn’t compare a shepherd to a government official, but rather a good shepherd to a poor excuse for one.\n“I am the good shepherd.” Whether you lived in ancient Palestine or you currently reside in Austin, Texas, that word good rings a bell.\nJust so there’s no confusion, Jesus does us a favor and clarifies things. The shepherd who is good is the one willing to lay down his life for the sheep. The good shepherd puts the sheep before himself. He is ready to sacrifice his own life for those in his care.\nMen, in a world that wants and rewards awesome and epic and great men, I challenge you to live and one day die a good man. And to do so by taking your cues from the one and only Good Shepherd who calls and knows His sheep by name, and was willing to lay down His one and only life for them. Whatever vocation you find yourself in day by day, you have the privilege of living your life in the footsteps of Jesus, the Good Shepherd.\nAnd just so there’s no confusion, let me clarify: the name of the game here is nothing less than sacrifice. It’s not that you and I are trying to be Christ, but that we’re trying to be Christlike. Live that way and you’ll no doubt be accused from time to time of having a messiah complex. That’s fine, whatever. The reality is that you’re simply a man trying to do the right thing, the good thing, the thing that Jesus would do if He were in your boots or your cap-toe oxfords or your Converse.\nWritten By John Blase\n\n                ",

Jesus’ disciples figured this man was blind for one of two reasons: either it was because he had sinned or because his parents had. Had they known he was born this way, they would have been certain his parents’ sin was behind his inability to see. Regardless, they were confident someone’s sin had caused it.\nNow, we shouldn’t be too rough on these guys. It sounds superstitious and hackneyed for them to say such a thing so bluntly, but if we are honest, they’re only saying out loud what we often think and feel.\nWhen our middle child was born, everything seemed fine.

Within a couple days, we were two hours from home at the Children’s Hospital in Jackson, Mississippi. No one was sure what was going on. We had not slept in days. We were tired, scared, and confused.\nBeing on staff at a great church meant that people cared for our family in ways we will never forget. But being on staff at a great church did not stop me from asking if I had done something that had caused this. I wondered which sin of mine my son was now paying for.\nThanks be to God, he has been our healthiest child ever since. Still, I couldn’t help but wonder what caused his trouble. I could attribute my questioning to sleep deprivation or the pressure of having a newborn son who couldn’t breathe correctly, but the truth is, I question God like this all the time. Flat tire? I wonder why I’m being punished. Kid has stomach bug at 2am? What sin did I commit to deserve this? And on and on and on.\nI think we are all spring-loaded to blame someone. We Christians tend to turn the blame around on ourselves. And because many of us have such a low view of God’s love for us and a high view of His disappointment with our behavior, we are tempted to believe suffering equals punishment for sin.\nBut Jesus turns all that on its head and makes it clear that the blind man’s sin is not the reason he was blind. And my sin is not the reason Knox had trouble breathing at two days old. The whole point of the blind man’s affliction was so the “works of God might be displayed in him” (John 9:3). Jesus used the healing of the blind man to attest to the truthfulness of His claims.\nFor me and my wife, the “works of God” were trusting Him in emergency rooms and NICUs. It was trusting that the One who gave His only Son was letting us go through this so we would see His glory. We did, and we thank Him for it still.\nWhat are you walking through? Where are you wondering if God is punishing someone else for your sin? The gospel tells us this in an impossibility. God will never lay the penalty of your sin or mine upon one of our sons, because He already laid it upon His own.\nWritten By Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

Add a dash of thick darkness, and you should get the band-aids ready. While playing on a sketchy outdoor playground at a greasy hamburger joint, my son wanted to see what was behind the playground’s main attraction—an abandoned school bus. I tagged along with him to see what was behind the bus. It was so dark I could barely see him. I turned on the flashlight on my phone, and when the light hit the ground in front him, we both saw he was seconds away from falling onto a jagged pile of concrete chunks. I snatched him as he stumbled forward, milliseconds from getting the worst cuts and scrapes of his life.\nIn a way, the light saved him. The light showed us reality. Light is essential to seeing what’s out there, what’s coming at us, where to go, and what to do.\nWhen Jesus says He is the light of the world, He’s telling us reality is found with Him. Jesus shines His light, and as we look at the world through His high-beams, we see we are sinners—people who have fallen short of God’s law. We see that we can’t save ourselves. And then we see He is the Savior we need, crucified for our sins, risen from the dead, reigning in the heavens, and returning soon. Jesus’ light helps us see the universe as He sees it—existing for Him and His glory. This light, Christ alone, gives us life.\nWe now see by faith all we couldn’t accurately see before. “In your light do we see light” (Psalm 36:9). In Christ, we now see hope for eternity and peace for today. In the Light of the World, we also see one another clearly as our racism, selfishness, and pride are exposed and we are empowered to love another better.\nAs we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, the Light of the World shines on us, and shines for us. Because of Jesus, we see the potholes and pitfalls of this world, the temptations and thorns, and the way to life everlasting. The light of Christ shows us how to live with him. “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path” (Psalm 119:105).\nBy faith in Christ, Who is light, we see the glory of God (2 Corinthians 3:18)—and one day we will see His face (Revelation 22:4). Christ is our vision, our Lord, our light, our all. He is the light we see by, and we can see clearly now.\nWritten By J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

When you ask the same of your neighbor, do you really want to know? For many of us, we only want to know when things are going well.\nI recently shared with a friend some our family’s struggles. With one of our sons, we’ve wrestled through ongoing difficulties, trauma, and dangerous behaviors. I trust that God is doing a work in our son’s life, and in our own hearts as well; but for the present, things are still rough. When I share this story, I find people desperately want to hear that everything’s getting better. It’s hard to hear “things are worse” or “nothing has changed.” These are uncomfortable truths, and when we hear them, we want to modify them. \nIs it surprising that when Christ came declaring the truth, even His own people resisted what He had to say?\nWhen Jesus, our perfect Prophet, speaks, do we listen? When He testifies that our works are evil, will we believe? Like the Pharisees, we tend to respond negatively to criticism.\nChrist declares truth, and the world hates Him for it (John 7:7). Christ comes from the Father, and the world seeks to reason away this truth (vv. 27-30). Christ speaks authoritatively, and the world rages at His authority (vv. 47-49). Christ dwells among us, and the world seeks to cast Him out, or kill Him (vv. 1, 41-43).\nOur fear of the truth is often rooted in the notion that truth is usually bad news. In a fallen world, the first part is indeed bad news. We’ve sinned, and the curse is real. But like the Pharisees, fear of facing the bad news often keeps us from seeing beyond it to the great news. \nOn the first days of the feast, Jesus reasoned with the crowd, but on the last day of the feast, He stood up and cried out. The bad news had to be faced, but the good news merited a resounding shout: To all who thirst, Christ offers living water!\nThe wasteland of the fall, the weight of the curse, and the truth of our own guilt are uncomfortable realities to face. But if we receive Christ as He comes to us—and we judge, not by appearances or by our fearful human standards, but with right judgment—then we find every reason to celebrate (Leviticus 23:39,41).\nThis is Christ’s resounding declaration: I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh! If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink, and out of his heart will flow rivers of living water! (Joel 2:28; John 7:37-38).\nWritten By Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I love bread. This is no writerly exaggeration. When I’m at a restaurant and the waiter asks if I’d like bread before my meal, I think to myself, “What planet are you from? Heavens yes, I want bread! Bring it hot, and bring it fast!” From cornbread to pumpernickel to brioche to tortillas—man, I love bread.\nI love Jesus. This, too, is no exaggeration. Jesus is, as Updike wrote, the “tall friend of my childhood.” I’ve loved him since I was a boy, wooed to His side by the King James Version of His love, faithfully proclaimed each Sunday by my father’s pastoral voice. And here, at almost fifty years of age, I love Jesus still.\nOne of the many things I adore about Jesus is the trick He often used when speaking. I do not use the word “trick” in a belittling sense at all. Jesus would fill the air with common words attached to a startling idea. He was, and is, a master of this. For example, “I am the Bread of Life.” To take this most common, and let’s face it, universally beloved thing—bread—and when the hungry people said, “Give us this bread,” to respond to them: “Its me!”? Genius. Absolutely genius.\nAnd while on that day such talk presented good news, full of ripe possibility, it also challenged the ears on which it fell. The text indicates that many disciples heard His words and found them tough, if not impossible, to swallow. Jesus was proclaiming bread with bones in it—His own. The people could understand the manna that Moses provided and how it sustained their ancestors in that wilderness time. But to make the jump from that to this son of Joseph, this son of Mary? Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable.\nNot much has changed. The Son of Man still stands before us, pointing to all the things we love, not to diminish those good gifts in any way, but to point to the better gift—Himself—and say, “All those things will leave you still hungry, still restless, still aching. But take Me and you will live forever, and never hunger or thirst again. I am the Bread of Life.” And while this message still strikes the mind as utterly unprovable, it endures a pleasure to the ear. An absolutely hopeful pleasure.\nI love bread. But I love Jesus more.\nWritten By John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    It seems as though the religious elite in Jesus’ day had really come to misunderstand the meaning of “rest.” Somewhere between Exodus 20 and John 5, Israel’s leaders and scholars had begun to interpret the Sabbath so strictly that they’d lost their bearings on the matter altogether. In an effort to protect the Sabbath and keep it holy, they turned God’s day of worship into the worship of God’s day. \nInstead of being a day of growing in wholeness and closeness to God, rest-oration, it had become an undue burden on God’s people—a day full or rules, codes, and classifications. This was never God’s intent, but as is often the case, humanity took God’s careful and loving Law and distorted it into something it was never meant to be.\nSabbath is not merely a state of passivity. It is the state of settling deeper into wholeness through God’s divinely bestowed love.\nWe can see this so clearly in John 5. Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath, does not seem to worry about the established customs of the day. Rather, He goes directly to a man who needs rest the most. Jesus honors the Sabbath that He created by bringing physical and spiritual healing to a lame man in great need. In so doing, Jesus not only restored the man’s physicality, but also his spirituality. An unclean person, like the crippled man, would’ve never been welcomed to the temple in Jesus’ day. By healing this man, Jesus restored a sense of wholeness and closeness to God in a matter of moments.\nRest, true rest, comes with healing. It may not be experienced right away, but we all know that it’s difficult to enter a true and complete rest when you’re in a state of suffering and pain. Our Sabbath days are markers and mileposts along this life journey. They are moments to stop, reflect, worship, receive new strength, become intimately closer with God, and regain the energy we need to persevere a little further.\nWe are meant to cease our work, not out of rule or obligation, but rather out of opportunity to create space in our lives for God to move. Much like the still, small voice who spoke to the prophet, God’s restoration in our lives comes frequently in an unobtrusive and undemanding manner. He shows up when we make room in the quiet.\nGod does not call us to seek passivity on the Sabbath, but wholeness—the type of wholeness that can only be found in Him. From that place and from that posture we go out into the world, bringing a healing and comfort that naturally emanates from our rested and spiritually reinvigorated souls.\nJesus didn’t heal on the Sabbath purely to make a statement (though He certainly did drive a pretty significant stake pertaining to His divinity that day). Rather, He did it to offer a glimpse of the wholeness and rest that His coming has inaugurated. It is not complete yet. His Kingdom has not completely come, but we’ve been given a foretaste. And we get a new foretaste each week when we lean into our God, Lord of the Sabbath. \nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

You don’t have what it takes. She was essentially saying, “You are delusional to think you can give me water without a bucket to collect it. You clearly don’t understand what gathering water takes, unless your water is something I don’t understand—something that fills a thirst I can’t even explain.”\nThe grace that sustains us—Jesus’ living water—is something we struggle to understand. We continually try to fit this grace into our economy of works, and it just will not fit. But we still try. I try because sometimes believing in my own snake-oil righteousness is easier. If I ignore my wrongs, this snake oil is all I need. So I work and judge and criticize and long to be better in order to make my snake oil good enough.\nWe understand the snake oil scam of the Old West, but do we see our desire for a modern day concoction?\n“If you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you…” \nThis is the hard edge of faith: do you believe this gift and do you believe the Giver? Do you believe that the living water of Jesus will sustain you? Do you believe that your snake-oil righteousness is a charade? Are you saying, “Sir, give me this water”?\nWhat a story the Samaritan woman can tell. She moves from the place of saying, “You have nothing,” to imploring, “Give me what you have.” This is a glorious story of the chaos the gift of God brings. It is the story of being so dug into our own economy of righteousness that we can’t see what real grace and righteousness look like. But Jesus sees it. And He knows that she, like us, needs what He alone can give.\nFaith in this gift and the Giver is a daily battle of giving up the snake oil, of letting go of an economy of performance that feels comfortable but ultimately destroys. The God of peace wants your soul to rest satisfied with the living water, the gift that is yours to receive by grace through faith in Jesus. \nMay we become the ones calling, “Sir, give me this water.”\nWritten By Jason Tippetts\n\n                ",

A thoughtful gift makes me realize that I matter. \nWhen God sent Jesus, it was because sinners—like you and me—matter to Him. Love without action is not real love. True love demands action, and there has been no greater act of love by anyone in the cosmos than God the Father giving His only Son to die for sinners like us. In this gift we see the character and nature of God on display. \nGod is the best gift giver. We hear many promises from lying lips that whisper, “I love you. I will give you everything,” only to then steal from us the attention and worship meant for the One who truly loves us. We must resist the temptation that plagues all men, which is to worship the gifts God gives instead of the Giver Himself. \nThe joy of receiving a gift increases with the quality of the gift. No man, when proposing to the woman he loves, comes to her with a ring pop or a cracker jack prize. He proposes with a ring of value, made with glimmering jewels and precious metals like gold, silver, or platinum. The quality of gift given by God is of infinite and priceless worth because the Son of God is perfect and matchless. Jesus, in His incarnation, has displayed the love of God. Those who place their trust in the One who gives a gift like this will never be put to shame.\nLove is costly. For the joy that was set before Jesus, He endured the cross and was put to shame (Hebrews 12:2). God spared no expense. No, He gave very best. The love of God the Father cost Him temporary separation from His Son so that sinners could eternally be joined to Him. \nFriend, you matter to God. Your pain and circumstances—He cares about them all. He does not just talk about His love for you; He shows you.\nWritten By Jevon Washington\n\n                ",

One of those things is that, despite myriad opportunities, she has resisted the urge to put me on the spot in public and embarrass me. Jesus didn’t have such a luxury. Mary put Him in quite a spot—and at a wedding, no less.\nWeddings in that culture were multiple-day celebrations with much feasting and drinking. For the wine to run out early was a real downer. It would shame the hosts and be terribly embarrassing, so when it happened at this wedding in Cana, Mary declared that her son could fix it. She knew something of His capabilities and that He was no mere man. Jesus gently reprimanded her because His time for this sort of thing had not yet come, the time in which He wanted to reveal His power and glory to people. But He helped nonetheless.\nBy turning water into wine, Jesus did more than save a host from embarrassment or add to the enjoyment of the guests. He revealed, ever so slightly, His power over the natural world. He wasn’t a magician. He was a creator. The Creator. The laws of nature did not apply to Him because He had written them.\nThe chapter takes an interesting turn here. It shifts from joy and celebration and partying and a miracle, to a more serious, intense, even angry tone. Jesus reveals another side of His glory and identity. At the wedding He revealed His generosity, His creative ability, His power over nature, and His desire for people’s joy and happiness. But in the temple He reveals His zeal for holiness and the perfect glory of His Father. \nUpon arriving at the temple during the Passover, a time when Jerusalem was overflowing with pilgrims who had come to worship as the law required, Jesus saw that this holy day of remembrance had been turned into an opportunity for commerce. Merchants lined the temple courtyard, selling animals for sacrifice (likely at a huge markup, as you would find in any tourist trap) and changing currency at a profit. This place was meant to be devoted to God during this celebration of how the Lord rescued His people. But now it was a mercenary’s heaven.\nJesus would have none of it. He drove the sellers out. He declared the temple to be His Father’s house. And, when challenged as to His authority, He prophesied His own death and resurrection by metaphorically calling Himself the temple, the gateway to God’s presence. Jesus declared Himself to be the Son of God, the sacrifice, and the means by which any who believed could enter God’s glory.\nWith subtlety, generosity, and flare, Jesus showed Himself to be Creator of the universe. With passion, fierceness, and strong (though veiled) language, Jesus declared Himself the Son of God. In both cases people were intrigued, though most found an explanation other than the truth. \nYet those with eyes to see and ears to hear believed and followed.  \nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

Everything is perfect. There’s no strife, no stress, and no strain. Things are exactly as they should be, and as you hoped they would be. Now, snap out of that insane daydream.\nImagine that’s all gone. Imagine that, in an instant, you stepped out of that place into the nightmare of a life that’s exactly the opposite. Every day is a struggle. Everything around you has broken, is broken, or is breaking. If you look around, that’s probably a little closer to the reality you face every day.\nJesus did just this—He stepped out of the riches of heaven and into the poverty of earth. We can probably imagine the stark difference in the picture I painted above. But what we can’t imagine is wanting to step out of heaven and into earth. The scenario above sounds like a nightmare. If anything, we’re dying to get from earth to heaven!\nPraise God for Jesus, the Word become flesh. God Himself took on flesh, coming to us on an über-mission trip from heaven to earth. He did so not out of frustration or with hesitancy, but with joy, even as He faced the torture of the cross (Hebrews 12:2).\nThe same Word who spoke the world into existence and set the lights in the sky (Genesis 1) is the same Word that brought His own light into our darkness (John 1:1-14). It’s nearly impossible to wrap our minds around someone wanting to step into our darkness, but that’s exactly what Jesus did. In love, the eternal Son of God, by whom all things were made and through whom all things hold together, took His first breath in Bethlehem and His last in Jerusalem (John 3:16; Colossians 1:15-17).\nAs we reflect on the recent Christmas season, may we not forget the simple but extravagant love of God displayed in the incarnation of His Son. May we never move on from the profound truth that God became a man, living the life we should have lived and dying the death we deserve. The Word became flesh and dwelled among us, dying a gruesome death and rising again to defeat it.

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I do not know how my life will end. Neither do you. \nThe Lord, in His wisdom, protects us from knowing these sorts of things—and this is most certainly a kindness. A mercy. If we knew such things, we might spend more time preparing to die than actually living.\nAs we come to the end of the book of Acts, we know some of what happens to Paul, but not everything. We know he is taken to Rome as a prisoner. And we know that he most likely died there as a martyr, although he was in Rome for several years before his death.\nWhen the book of Acts ends, the author Luke does not reveal (and maybe doesn’t know) what would come of Paul. But when he tells us Paul made it to Rome, I detect a note of joy in his words. This was a dream of Paul’s—to take the gospel into the heart of the Roman Empire (Romans 1:8-15).\nIn today’s passage, Luke does not frame Paul’s imprisonment there as a negative, but as a situation that actually served to strengthen the Church. Christians who had come to know Jesus through Paul’s teaching heard he was there, and they came to care for him and learn from him (Acts 28:17). Because he was under house arrest, Paul’s place of incarceration became a gathering ground for those who had been set free by the gospel he proclaimed. This went on for at least two years (Acts 28:30).\nThe traditional position is that Paul was released from this imprisonment but stayed in Rome as a missionary, and was arrested again later. This second imprisonment was the one scholars believe led to his execution.\nWhen we consider the arc of Paul’s story—from his early days as a persecutor of the Church, to his missionary journeys, to his last days in Rome—we see a man who had to lose everything in order to find the life he knew. He lost his position, his reputation, his career path, his circle of friends, even his hometown. Paul’s life looks to me like a candle that was lit on the road to Damascus, and from then on was burning down to its inevitable end.\nI believe the reason Paul continued to boldly minister to the people of Rome, even though the gospel he proclaimed was the very reason he had been brought there as a prisoner, was because this had become his life. Paul knew nothing else but this cycle of risking his freedom to bear witness to the One who could set others free.\nWhen we come to the end of Paul’s story, we find him not preparing to die, but continuing to live, confident in the gospel and unafraid of what might come his way. \nI don’t know what is coming my way, and neither do you. But the book of Acts tells us the story of what we have—a risen Savior, an indwelling Holy Spirit, a continuing Church, and a gospel with the power to set captives free. For these things, may we give thanks to our Father in Heaven, and trust Him for all that we cannot see as we continue to live on.\nWritten By Russ Ramsey \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I’m old enough to have seen the first Indiana Jones movie in the theater six times. It was at the Cinema City 8 for at least a year. This was just before VCRs, when good movies would be shown for months in the theaters.\nFor the life of me, I cannot understand why I went to see that film over and over. It was a great movie and universally loved, but I had nightmares for months. Not about the scary scenes of melting faces. No, I had nightmares about snakes. I was terrified of them then and I still have an irrational fear of them today. \nAs many times as I’ve sat through that movie, I have never been able to watch the entire scene where they actually find the ark. I have also never been in the building that houses the snakes at the zoo. And I feel like I’ve really accomplished something when I cut the grass without getting a snake bite.\nBeing bitten by a snake is my biggest fear. Second to that is just seeing one.\nIn Acts 27, Paul is in the custody of the Roman authorities for preaching Christ. He is on a ship. The ship is full of prisoners, and when it is shipwrecked, someone thinks it’s a good idea to kill them instead of letting them escape. Thankfully, they are spared. But once they get on land, Paul is bitten on the hand by a snake. The viper is so poisonous that everyone assumes Paul will die. Furthermore, the island natives assume he must be a murderer and he is receiving justice. But Paul lives, and he is able to use that hand to turn around and heal the father of the chief of the island.\nLet’s review. Paul is under arrest. He then survives a shipwreck only to have his life threatened again by the soldiers on the boat. Then, my worst fear—on an unknown land he is bitten by a very deadly snake. And Luke, the writer of Acts, makes it clear that Paul continues throughout all of this to minister to everyone around him. \nWherever you read about Paul in the New Testament, there is this “To live is Christ, to die is gain” hum happening. Sometimes it is in the background but, more often than not, it is in the foreground.\nEvangelicals today are fond of saying “It was a God thing” when something really good happens. While I refuse to ever say that out loud, I emotionally respond that way. I tend to see good events as sent by God. I also see bad and challenging events as sent by God, but I lean toward thinking they are punishment for some sin—sometimes to the point that I find myself feeling wrecked with guilt.\nBut Paul, who once terrorized the Church, was so convinced of God’s affection for him that he could see all the good and the bad as a “Christ thing.” To Paul, everything was about Jesus and His glory and His mission to save sinners.\nMy prayer? To see every won parking place and every cancer diagnosis, every triumph and every disappointment, every new and shiny gift and every loss as being about Christ and the glory of His grace toward sinners.\nWritten By Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Sometimes what is just is not right, and what is right is not just – at least in legal terms. Sometimes the law’s rigidity actually keeps people from doing right, yet obeying the law and abiding by it is right. It’s a conundrum, one that Paul found himself facing in Acts 25 and 26.\nAfter being arrested, Paul was transported to Caesarea where he would go before Festus, the Roman governor. Paul pled his case to Festus, and that’s when things went awry. In the same way that Pontius Pilate once privately declared Jesus innocent but then handed Him over to be crucified, so also Festus declared Paul innocent yet did not set him free. \nInstead, he kept Paul until Agrippa, the Jewish King, could come down and hear him too. What Paul did, when given the opportunity to face Agrippa, was astounding. He did not plead his case legally. He did not argue his innocence, though he did make it clear that he was innocent. He did not try to argue the law at all. Instead, Paul gave full testimony to why he followed Jesus and why everyone else in the court should too.\nThe most natural thing for Paul to do would have been to try to save his own life. But what he did instead was try to save the souls of everyone present. Agrippa even scoffed at Paul, asking if he really thought he could convince Agrippa to believe, in such a context and in such a short time. \nPaul’s response? “I absolutely hope so!”\nPaul was drawing on the promise that God does not forget His saints and that the Lord gives power to His people in the moment they need it. He trusted in this and he declared it. He did not fear or cower or try to manipulate.\nIn the end, Paul was sent to Rome to face Caesar. It was legal, but it was not right. He was innocent but he was condemned. A Roman governor conspired with a Jewish king to kill an innocent man for honoring God. And the innocent man went willingly. Paul did not wonder what Jesus might have done. He did precisely what Jesus had done—he let them take him. \nIn a culture where we demand our rights, Paul’s humble obedience to the Lord in the face of a personal injustice gives us a gut-check. God works through seasons of ease as well as hardship, which means whatever season we’re in, God is with us, no matter how unfair things seem.\nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

Eight days without work. Eight days of taking scrupulous notes in order to follow the arguments and render a verdict. She was proud of her service, but glad to be finished. I was glad to get out of that chair. \nIn today’s text, Paul has been summoned, but not for jury duty. He’s there for another round as the accused. He’s in and out of court, always in trouble for one reason or another. If he’s not in some sort of official predicament, he’s getting shipwrecked, or he’s raising money, or he’s dealing with some new conflict. \nYet here he is, offering up his sacrifice of praise and acknowledging God’s providence and grace, just like the author of Hebrews writes in 13:15. I’m not sure I would start my speech with this opening line: “Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense,” (Acts 24:10) but Paul pulls it off. He knows God is in charge. He trusts that all will be for good, that Jeremiah 29:11-14 still applies— that God has a plan for him and that nothing can separate him from the love of Christ. \nWhat about you? What about me? I often think God abandons me or is distant and uncaring. But I’m likely to do so under far tamer circumstances than those Paul endured—like when I have a big test, or when I have to file an important project, or when I have to have a difficult conversation, or when I have to go to the dentist. I don’t like going through hard things. So, of course, when I do, I feel like God has abandoned me! \nFor this, I have to admit my weaknesses and lack of faith, and rely on Christ and His riches, His love, and His care for me. Paul displays this, even standing before high priests and governors. Yes, it’s courage. But more than that, it’s Christ. He is our Advocate, our Great High Priest, the Lord of Lords and King of Kings. He’s our Redeemer, so I can stand with confidence and tell my story—His story. \nWritten By Doug Serven\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I’ve always wondered what happened to those 40-some-odd men who took oaths not to eat until they had killed Paul. Paul, as it turns out, lived for quite some time after those vows were taken. I reckon those men eventually just gave up. The zeal and fervor of the wicked cannot overcome the sovereign providence of God.\nThe cause of the Jewish religious leaders’ hatred for Paul was his ministry to the Gentiles. Considering themselves devout and committed to their false version of the faith, they took a sacred oath. This was not merely a personal vendetta, but a satanic commitment to oppose Christ. As Jesus declared in John 8:44: “You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” \nThe religious leaders hated the gospel of Christ, and so were opposed to Paul, the apostle of Christ. \nIn contrast to the rashness of the religious leaders, we see Paul’s measured and wise response. He neither panics nor despairs in the face of the threat, but trusts himself to God’s good care, while at the same time prudently engaging the means of help available to him. The civility of a centurion, the power and might of pagan Rome under the Julian law code, and the Pax Romana, in God’s providence, were the means by which God not only preserved Paul’s life, but also furthered the apostle’s ministry among the Gentiles.\nThere are really only two views of Providence we can take. Either God is sovereign over all, or else the course of time and history is in the hands of men. If men govern the tide of time, then plots and oaths and human connivings are perhaps the best means to gain ground. \nBut “the earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it” (Psalm 24:1). No plot, no priesthood, no zeal, no army can confound His will or harm those in His care. All men belong to God. Rome was God’s. Caesar and all his legions were God’s. Even the devil is God’s (Job 1:9-12). Paul knew that he need not be anxious about anything, because God, the Almighty, gave him life and no man could snatch it from him apart from God’s will (Philippians 4:6, Job 33:4, John 10:28, Matthew 10:28).\nDo we have this same confidence? Do we fret and fear in the face of the world’s might? Do we trust our own strength and resolve to make our way in the world? Remember, it is the Almighty who gives us life. No power, human or spiritual, can snatch us from His care. \nThough we may be afflicted, perplexed, and persecuted, we can yet walk in hope, joy, and confidence, knowing that “we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies” (2 Corinthians 4:11). \nThanks be to God.\nWritten By Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I am intensely afraid of heights. Like, paralyzed-on-a-second-story-roof afraid. I once was helping a friend put Christmas lights on her house, and though I was petrified to climb a ladder and get onto the roof, I put that fear aside in order to help her out. Unfortunately, once I got on the roof, I was toast. My brain said, “Just climb back down to the ladder. You won’t fall or break anything—it’s perfectly safe.” But my body wouldn’t respond to logic. My legs were like Jell-O. I was stuck.\nI took a risk for a friend—which was the right thing to do—but I suffered embarrassment and stress in the process. And I vowed to never feel like that again. If I were on a courtroom TV show, I would’ve definitely sued that roof for causing me mental anguish.\nIn today’s passage, we see Paul taking a risk for not only his friends, but ultimately his Lord. That might be the last time I ever climb on a roof, but this is not the first or last time Paul put himself in harm’s way for the sake of Christ.\nIn this scene, he is at the temple teaching something he knew the crowd would likely reject. But this crowd wasn’t merely unbelieving pagans who didn’t know him; these people were Jews—God’s people, Paul’s people. This crowd was predisposed to despise Paul because, though he was one of them, his gospel was an affront to their beliefs. Knowing that, he and his companions still entered the temple and preached the gospel.\nSo why did Paul enter the temple knowing the danger? The obvious answer is that he knew the Great Commission. Sure. But more than that, he did it out of love.\nRemember what he says to the Romans: “I have intense sorrow and continual anguish in my heart. For I could almost wish to be cursed and cut off from the Messiah for the benefit of my brothers, my own flesh and blood” (Romans 9:2-3). Paul wanted those closest to him to know Christ and be saved, so much so that he was willing to trade his own eternal fate for theirs. He was willing to be embarrassed—and much worse if that’s what it took.\nThis passage speaks not simply to door-to-door evangelism or handing out pamphlets at the mall; it speaks to sharing Christ with those closest to us. After all, why would we spend hours and hours trying to tell strangers about Jesus when our own family, friends, coworkers, and classmates don’t know him?\nMy risk was not Paul’s risk. But we both suffered at some level because love compelled us to take a risk for someone else. The difference between Paul and me is that he was more willing to be beaten for the gospel than I am to climb on another roof. He risked over and over again, and I’ve not stepped foot on a roof since.\nFor many of us, our instinct is to avoid risk, even when the risk in question is motivated by love. We can look up that ladder and talk ourselves into believing it’s not worth the personal pain or hassle. But in the gospel, the real risk is not loving others. \nThe question for us is, which do we see as a greater risk—self-preservation or gospel-motivated love?\nWritten By Brandon D.

His friends pleaded with him not to go, but off he went. He knew it might be to his demise, but he also knew that ignoring the prodding of the Holy Spirit would have been even worse than death.\nWhen he arrived, Paul went straight to James, the brother of Jesus, who was the most respected leader of the church in Jerusalem. Paul shared what God had done during his journeys.\nThis was significant. Paul was Paul, the most prominent of the apostles, but he went to James for counsel in a posture of humility. He didn’t arrive as the conquering hero or star preacher. He abided by decisions made by the counsel of elders. He saw himself as part of the Church, not the star of the Church.\nWhat Paul did next was the true “Don’t go in there!” moment. We felt it when he headed toward Jerusalem, the ominous music in minor tones playing in our minds. But when he entered the temple, we knew he was walking into the den of the beast (“beast” being the religious leaders of Israel who hated him and the work he was doing). \nWhen some of the people who despised Paul saw him enter the temple with four others, they assumed one of the men was a Gentile named Trophimus, who had been seen with Paul earlier in the day. They assumed Paul had brought a Gentile into the temple area, defiling their customs, and they turned on him. \nThrough lies and false accusations they riled up a crowd so rabid Paul would have been torn apart if Roman soldiers hadn’t arrested him. The fervor and ire of the religious leaders echoed back to a number of years earlier in Jerusalem when a man was arrested on false premises and killed on a cross a few hours later. That was the man who Paul sought to honor with his whole life. And this arrest would eventually lead to Paul’s death too.\nBut Paul knew this. He knew he “shouldn’t go in there.” Was Paul a fool? By human standards, maybe; but by that standard so was Jesus. What Paul did was the same as what Jesus did – the thing that the Holy Spirit compelled Him to do in order to give glory to God. Such actions are never foolish, no matter the cost.\nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

He lay stretched out in his recliner, covered with soft blankets, the pillows behind him carefully arranged. A plastic cup with a lid and a straw stood on the small table beside him. We spoke quietly, but I did not have much to say. \nI was hearing his final words of exhortation to me. He knew his end was near, and it gave weight to his every syllable. Time slowed down. I remember listening very carefully, treasuring up each word in my heart. I remember, too, how confidently and peacefully he faced eternity.  \nAs Paul journeys toward his own final trials, everything seems to slow down. Luke records the names of each friend that fellowshipped with them along the way: Sopater, Aristarchus, Secundus, Gaius, Timothy, Tychichus, Trophimus, and the elders of Ephesus (Acts 20:4). This was a time of final goodbyes, and we read that “there was much weeping on the part of all” (Acts 20:37).\nLuke records each stopping place: Greece, Macedonia, Troas, Assos, Mitylene, Chios, Samos, and Miletus. He also counts the months and days. Each detail of that final voyage is stretched out. Even Paul’s sermon one evening at Troas extends well into the night, until young Eutychus fell asleep and “fell down from the third story and was taken up dead” (Acts 20:9). \nBut, as the story of Eutychus reveals, this lengthening of months, weeks, days, and hours is marked by God’s favor and direction. From the healing of Eutychus to the Spirit filled confidence of Paul, we see God at work. And it is precisely this which God desires us to see: Christ is at work, and His grace abounds.\nUpon arriving at Miletus, Paul summons the Ephesian elders to give them his final exhortations and instructions. \nWhat would you say if it was your final word?\nPaul’s declaration is simple: “I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God” (Acts 20:24). \nIn the face of impending death, in the face of sorrowful and final goodbyes, Paul had set his heart upon Christ alone, and His kingdom. Paul’s hope, his confidence, his purpose, and his joy were fixed in Christ. As he declared in his letter to the Philippians, “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain” (1:21).\nThis too must be our eager hope and expectation. \nAnd, as Paul warns, we will face many obstacles. Wolves will come in among us, seeking to harm the flock of God. From our own midst will arise some who will deceive and seek to draw us away. How will we remain alert? \nPaul declares: “I commend you to God… remember the words of the Lord Jesus” (Acts 20:32, 35).\nThese two truths are our security: \n\nWhether in life or in death, our lives are in God’s hands, and there is no better place to be, and,\n\nIn this world full of trouble, we have a sure source of comfort, purpose, confidence, peace, and life in the words of our Lord.\n\n\nThanks be to God!\nWritten By Caleb Faires \n\n                ",

This is why, when we’re not directing our worship at God, we automatically begin investing it in something else.\nAs far as we know, idols have existed from the earliest days of post-Fall creation. It’s easy for us to scoff at ancient worshipers for thinking that a carved log or chiseled stone could be a god; but perhaps that’s our fault for misunderstanding the custom. The small totems and family idols weren’t meant to be actual gods, but rather physical manifestations or meeting places where the natural could fellowship with the supernatural.\nThe craftsmen in Ephesus were working from this framework. Their idols of Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, were not meant to be Artemis herself, but a physical place where the common could connect to the divine.\nPaul’s ministry in Ephesus confronted at least two major problems with this system of worship. The first and most notable was that Artemis was not a true god in any sense. At best, the people of Ephesus were worshiping a figment of their imagination. At worst, they were playing around with dark spiritual powers. \nThe second problem was that the worship of Artemis in Ephesus had been highly commercialized. It’s easy to see that a large catalyst for the riot in Ephesus was that the merchants and craftsmen were getting hit where it hurt—not in their hearts, but in their pocketbooks.\nIn spite of the healings they had witnessed and the miracles they had seen, the leaders at Ephesus were outraged because Paul’s ministry was cutting into their sales, distribution, and profits. Fewer faithful servants to Artemis meant a decrease in demand for idols, which meant a decrease in demand for silver, which meant a decrease in demand for fine craftsmanship, which meant less revenue for all involved.\nThese leaders had been confronted with powerful, life-changing, life-giving truth; but it was far more comfortable and far more profitable for them to protect the idols they knew. They chose to stick with what they knew instead of embracing what Paul continually demonstrated to be actually sacred and true. \nIt’s easy to judge the Ephesian craftsman and the riotous mob for their stubbornness or perhaps even their greed, but it seems like all too often we make similar decisions with our own lives.\nLike the man with his lizard in C.S. Lewis’ The Great Divorce, we all have idols or pet sins we hold onto because they are convenient, make us feel better, or in some way seem profitable. We are not foolish enough to think that our idols are actual gods. Rather we use them as a meeting place where we hope to find peace or security.\nThere are times when following the one, true, and everlasting God will be costly, even painful. It probably won’t be because you’re manufacturing idols to Artemis, but it could be because you’re involved with the production or worship of other cultural idols (less easily recognized as such, but idols all the same).\nWe are like the Ephesians. We all have things that we worship and adore that are not the one true God. Whether we hold on to them out of fear of letting go, or we protect them to hedge in our comforts, we are called to release them and to lay them down. \nTrue freedom is found in surrender to the one, true, and everlasting God. When we search the deepest recesses of our souls, we know this to be true. All we need to do is ask, and God will deliver us.\nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

We all know the brilliant mind, natural athlete, gifted artist, or charismatic leader. You may even know someone who is a sickeningly awesome combination of all four.\nIn today’s text we meet someone I imagine was like that—a man who will become a very influential leader in the early Church—the eloquent Apollos.\nApollos reminds me of another character we’ve already studied, Barnabas, in that he appears several times in Acts but never really as the primary character in any of the passages. So if we don’t try to pin him down a bit, we might never really see him. \nApollos was a man who had embraced the teachings of John the Baptist concerning Jesus (Acts 18:25), either by traveling to Jerusalem to hear him personally, or by hearing one of John’s disciples who traveled to Alexandria after John was beheaded by Herod (Mark 6:25).\nEither way, as a result of his interest in John the Baptist, Apollos believed a lot of things that were true. It’s just that he didn’t have the full picture. But, boy, was he a gifted speaker.\nWhat do you do with someone like this? Well, Aquila and Priscilla heard Apollos teach, and they knew something needed to be done. But what? Should they warn his hearers that his teaching was deficient? Should they brand him a heretic? Should they try and steal away his students?\nIt seems what they did was invite him over for dinner.\nApollos wasn’t the enemy. He was, if anything, a gifted asset to the Church—which he’d later prove to be in Corinth, where he would serve in a long, fruitful ministry. Aquila and Priscilla took Apollos under their wing and filled out the picture for him. They told him the rest of the story. \nWhat all they taught him, we can’t know for sure. But what we do know is this: 1) Apollos was humble enough to be corrected, 2) he embraced what Aquila and Priscilla taught him, and 3) his effectiveness as a preacher only grew.\nSo, apparently, Apollos was also gifted at being humble and teachable. Sheesh.\nApollos and his gifts were an asset to the Church. But here we’re reminded of something crucial to the health of any Christian fellowship: doctrine matters. \nApollos seems like a man people would follow based on his polish and pedigree alone, regardless of what he taught. This happens all the time. We like being around gifted people. But you can have all the gifts in the world, all appearances of a “successful looking” life, use all the right trendy words by which to introduce yourself; and when you’ve finished listing all your appealing qualities, if your doctrine is weak, incomplete (intentionally or not), or false, what then?\nI love this passage for the way it speaks not into our weaknesses, but our strengths. It says, Don’t trust your strengths carry you. One of the best gifts Apollos had working for him was people who would take him as he was and seek to deepen his understanding of the truth.\nWhere are you relying on gifts and talents to carry you beyond what you actually understand? Who would your Priscilla and Aquila be? What would it look like to seek their help to grow beyond your natural talents into a deeper understanding of the truth? What would that sort of humility look like?\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

It’s Italian for “the man with no name.” \nIt also refers to the protagonist played by Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone’s trilogy of westerns: A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. \nA key element in those genre-bending westerns was keeping the main character nameless, and thus mysterious, almost otherworldly. Nobody knew where he came from or where he was going, but they sure as shooting were witnesses to his brand of cinematic high plains justice. The man with no name.\nPaul rode into Athens, so to speak, and was appalled at the number of idols/shrines. But he reined in his anger and set about to discussing this with the philosophers in town: “It is plain to see that you Athenians take your religion seriously…I even came across an altar to THE GOD WITH NO NAME” (Acts 17:22-23, my paraphrase). \nBut rather than leave them in their ignorance, Paul introduced them to the one, true God—He is the God who created all there is, the God who doesn’t need a shrine or any human help for that matter, the God who spoke into existence the entire human race, the God who is always near, the God in whom we live and move and have our being, the God who commands people everywhere to repent and turn to the Man God has appointed as judge, the very Man God raised from the dead.\nAnd just like that, the GOD WITH NO NAME was named: Jesus.\nJesus’ genre-bending narrative was like nothing the people of Athens had heard before. And once they heard it they had no excuses. They could choose His brand of cinematic-technicolor mercy, or they could refuse it. What they couldn’t do any longer was ignore it. Actually, they could no longer ignore Him—the God with a name, JESUS, who was crucified, died, buried, and raised from the dead.\nIt is the same choice before us today. Refuse, or choose the known God with fists full of justice and mercy. He is good, and His name is Jesus.\nWritten By John Blase \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Has God ever brought you to the end of yourself?\nWhen I was an RUF campus minister at the University of Oklahoma, I received a phone call from one of my students on the Saturday of the OU-Texas football game. This match-up is played every year in Dallas, and it’s a huge party.\nMy student had already called his dad, who had instructed him to call me next. He told me he was calling from jail. He’d been arrested for public intoxication. I told him I was glad to hear from him, that I hoped he was okay, and that I’d talk to him next when he returned home. But that was all I could do for him.\nGoing to jail might be one of the most stressful things that can happen to a person. My student’s incarceration turned into a time of gospel renewal for him. His embarrassment became a turning point in his life.\nThough I wish my student had been in jail for a different reason, the Lord used that time to change his life. But in Acts 16, when Paul and Silas were also sent to jail, their time behind bars ended up changing their jailer’s life. This chapter tells a fascinating, and rather odd, story. Read the text and you’ll see what I mean.\nPaul commanded an evil spirit to come out of a slave girl who was being used to make money for her masters. The owners weren’t happy their fortune-teller could no longer profit them. So they had Paul and his buddy Silas put in jail. \nWhat happened next was nothing like the story my student told about the night he spent in the drunk tank in the West End in Dallas. The earth shook and the prison doors opened and prisoners were free to escape—but they didn’t. The jailer knew this was somehow connected to their God. \nLuke describes it this way: \n“Then he brought them out and said, ‘Sirs, what must I do to be saved?’ And they said, ‘Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.’ And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family. Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God” (Acts 10:30–34).\nIt’s amazing that God uses things like incarceration for His glory. He did this both for Paul and Silas and for my student at OU. God uses evil for good. He redeems bad situations. This is His way. One of the ways God gets our attention is by bringing us to the end of ourselves. \nHow has He done this, or how is He currently doing this, in your life?\nWritten By Doug Serven \n\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Relationships are complicated, aren’t they? \nSometimes I think if I just could manage them correctly, all my friendships would be devoid of conflict. But that’s not true. You know that, right? \nConflict is part of relating to others, and not all conflict is born out of sin. In fact, some of it comes from God desiring to do something in your life that He does not plan to do in another’s.\nPaul and Barnabas found themselves in conflict, and it separated them. But before we search for who’s to blame, let’s look at it. \nEarlier, these two men had been set apart by their church to take the gospel to the Roman Empire (Acts 13:1-3). They had already completed one missionary journey, and now they set out to plan a second. That’s when we get the unsettling news that Paul and Barnabas were parting ways over whether Barnabas’ cousin, John Mark (Col. 4:10), who’d left them on the first missionary journey, could come with them on the second.\nPaul knew this journey would only be harder, so he said “no”—apparently regarding Mark’s leaving as, at best, an indication of weakness or, at worst, a form of desertion. They would, after all, return to the same cities they’d previously been thrown out of, even stoned in. Lives were at stake here. Paul needed his team to have clear eyes and committed hearts.\nBut how could Barnabas tell his own cousin he couldn’t come? This wasn’t in Barnabas’ chemistry. He got his name, “Son of Encouragement,” for his willingness to believe the best in people. Barnabas believed in John Mark so strongly that it led to a “sharp disagreement” between him and Paul, which led to their separation (Acts 15:39).\nThe Apostle took a stand for the intensity of the mission. The Son of Encouragement took a stand for his cousin. We can’t be too hard on either of them for this. Our strengths are often our weaknesses too. Still, their conflict carried with it this consequence: Silas would go in Barnabas’ place.\nThis is the classic struggle over choosing which to put first—relationships or the work at hand. Sometimes we have to make that choice. Barnabas had invested so much in Paul, yet Paul’s work was to the Gentiles throughout Rome. \nWhat would you have done? The principle Paul applies here is that the call to do what Christ had set Him apart to do was prime. Anything that jeopardized that mission was second to the mission itself. This is consistent with Paul. He was one who contended for the gospel to be heard among the nations.\nLater references in 1 Corinthians 9:6, Colossians 4:10, and 2 Timothy 4:11 suggest that Paul, Barnabas, and John Mark went on to consider each other as co-laborers in the gospel, but this split had to have hurt all three. \nWhere are you wounded from a relationship strained by mission, loyalties, or some sort of change in call?\nEverything God does is motivated by His perfect love. We can rest in knowing that even when His call means relationship are strained, we can trust Him. Because God has decreed by His wise providence that a life spent making His grace known is richer by far than a life spent pursuing comfort.\nWritten By Russ Ramsey \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I’m sitting here reading Acts for the thousandth time. I’ve always read this story of the Jerusalem Council and focused on the theological implications. I’ve reviled in my heart those who were part of the Pharisees. I’ve identified with Paul and Barnabas and the others in their desire to deliver a gospel of grace.\nBut I’ve never really thought about what it must have been like to receive that news from the Jerusalem Council.\nWhen our second child was born we were living in a small Mississippi Delta town. The day we came home from the hospital, we noticed his lips would turn blue whenever he would go to sleep. We rushed to the ER at the local hospital, and within 24 hours we were at the Children’s Hospital down in Jackson and no one knew what was wrong. He would just quit breathing.\nOver the next few days, our son was run through every test imaginable. We wondered if he would live, or if he would have health issues for the rest of his life. We were exhausted, anxious, and emotionally spent. Then the breathing problem just stopped. He was pronounced healthy. You can imagine our relief when we got the news.\nThey told us to keep an eye on him (as if we’d be able to stop). And they told us he would need regular checkups but he was as healthy a baby as they had ever seen. Our hearts, once so unsure, were now encouraged.\nWhen the representatives from the Jerusalem Council went down to Antioch, they gathered the congregation and delivered the letter. “And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement” (Acts 15:31).\nUp until then, these believers had been getting mixed messages. From Paul they had heard they did not need to be circumcised, but other voices said that was incorrect. Yes, they would have dreaded circumcision because of the physical pain, but I’m sure they also didn’t like wondering whether they were justified before God. Their hearts, which were so unsure, were now encouraged.\nStill, I doubt the matter was ever completely settled among them. There were—and still are—plenty of Pharisees who want to add to the gospel and do not believe we are fully justified by faith in Christ’s work on our behalf. Heck, I live with a constant Pharisaical conscience that tells me there is something else I need to do before God will truly love, accept, and forgive me. Every time this happens I am unsure how to proceed. My first instinct is that I need to do something really painful or sacrificial to make things right with God, but that is not the gospel.\nWhat we all need to hear in those situations is what those believers in Antioch were so encouraged: we have already been justified by faith and we need to rest in the work of Christ. With this knowledge, and by the power of the Holy Spirit, we can fight the voices that insist we need to add our own works to a salvation perfectly accomplished by Christ.\nWritten By Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

The more we get, the more we want. It’s addictive, and and it affects our brains like a drug. We become stupefied and begin doing foolish things to gain further acclaim or hold on to what we’ve got (Think reality TV).\nMany of us believe that with popularity comes happiness and fulfillment, and we ignore all the signs that indicate just the opposite.\nWhat happens when our addiction to praise puts us in direct conflict with God’s Word? That’s precisely what happened to Paul and Barnabas in Acts 14, in the town of Lystra. Paul was preaching when he saw a crippled man in the crowd, and in the man he saw a spark of faith. So Paul called out to him and said, “Stand upright,” and the man did. His faith had made him well. \nAt this, the whole crowd turned to Paul and Barnabas and declared them to be gods—Hermes and Zeus, respectively. They brought out bulls to sacrifice and placed garlands on them. What a scene!\nMost people, followers of Christ or otherwise, would likely balk at being called a deity. But I don’t think many of us would protest very hard. We might offer a token, half-hearted, “C’mon guys, don’t do that.” But that’s not how Paul and Barnabas responded. They rushed into the crowd, pleading with them not to do this, proclaiming that they were men just like everyone else. They declared their God was a better way and wanted no part of this celebration. Paul and Barnabas knew their place before God and how much the people needed to hear His good news, and no amount of praise would deflect them from their course.\nJust days later, the same crowd that had praised them turned on Paul to stone him. They rejected his message and left him for dead. This is the fickle turn of fame and the cost of standing up for the gospel. \nIn his second letter to Timothy, Paul would write, “All who seek to live a godly life will face persecution” (3:12). That’s quite the juxtaposition to the pursuit of praise. But it was worth it to him. Even from prison at the end of his life, Paul prayed that a door would be opened for the gospel—the same gospel that put him there.\nThe hope and truth of the gospel drove Paul. Fame and fortune seemed to mean nothing to him, though I’m sure he battled their stupefying power. \nWhat would it look like for us to live lives life free from the need for earthly acclaim? What would have to change? What would have to take hold?\nMaybe the best first step would be for us to own that we’re at least a little tempted to seek the praise and favor of men, and to open a prayer for help with that confession.\nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

I first become most intimately familiar with the concept through Steven Pressfield’s The War of Art. Pressfield penned War with writers and creative types in mind, but its message broadly applies to all of us.\nWhile not a Christian (as far as I know), Pressfield’s writing contains some deeply spiritual themes. I for one believe this is because every act of creation sparks within us the image of God. Regardless, Pressfield names a force called “the resistance,” which simply put is the sum total of all that stymies or impedes our endeavors. Some call it writer’s block, others call it procrastination, others yet call it leisure time. Whatever you call it; the resistance is real. I’ve felt it and fought it, and I’m sure, regardless of your profession or calling, you have too.\nI believe there is a spiritual sort of resistance all Christ-followers encounter. It’s a tangible opposition to the work of redemption. Certainly Paul and the earliest apostles felt it. In fact, it was rare for them to enter a city and not experience opposition. Their arrival in Antioch was no exception. Wherever they found eager and open hearts, they also found hostile and dissenting parties.\nThere are a couple quick lessons we can learn from Acts 13 concerning spiritual resistance and opposition.\n1. If we’re preaching the gospel, if we’re attempting to expand the Kingdom of God whether in word or deed, we will experience resistance.\nThis could be as direct as verbal objections, terse words, or ad hominem attacks. Or it could be as subtle as the passive resistance of systemic injustices that oppose godly change. Paul and Barnabas experienced this in nearly every town they entered.\n2. Redirection is not the same thing as resistance.\nNot once, but twice, Paul was turned back from a location by the power of the Holy Spirit (Acts 16, 21). We sometimes have a tendency to interpret all challenges as spiritual attacks and persecution, but this is not always the case. There are times when we experience pushback because God is course correcting. Other times, we experience pushback because we’ve made a foolish decision. Neither one of those situations should be considered persecution or spiritual opposition. Rather, they are opportunities to learn, grow, change. Be careful in discerning the difference between these different scenarios. Paul and Barnabas certainly had to be. \n3. Sometimes we’re called to rebuke the resistance.\nIn Acts 13, we see an instance in which Paul and Barnabas rebuked the resistance (v. 10).  Paul, being filled with the Holy Spirit, didn’t mince any words about it either. He was incredibly direct. Likewise, there are times when we are called to push back against the resistance to the gospel with boldness.  \n4. Other times we’re called to endure the resistance.\nIt takes careful and discerning conversation with spiritual leaders and intentional time in prayer to know the difference, but there are times when our posture is to be one of endurance and perseverance. Not every manifestation of the spiritual resistance or oppression can be immediately rebuked and overcome.\nWhether from a stage or in a break room, whether online or in a coffee shop, if we preach the gospel or enact gospel-centered justice, we will encounter resistance and opposition. Remember though—we, like Paul, can only confront and endure by the power of the Holy Spirit. \nMay we be rooted and established in His love, trusting that knowing how to respond when we face opposition will become clear as we venture on.\nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The providence of God is mysterious business. If you’ve ever looked at the hand you’ve been dealt and felt confused by God’s logic, you know what I’m talking about. Job 14:5 tells us that God determines the number of our days, and we cannot pass the limits He has appointed. We live every one of our days in these mysterious boundaries.\nActs 12 is a sweeping narrative dealing with God’s prerogative to determine the number of days for those who love Him and also for those who don’t.\nThe chapter opens with of the death of James, the brother of John. Herod unceremoniously killed James in an effort to please the Jews. What is so stark about this is that the entire story of this key disciple’s beheading is told in just one verse—“Herod killed James the brother of John with the sword” (12:2). James, one of Jesus’ closest disciples, present at the transfiguration, was killed by a vicious, paranoid ruler, and this is all we’re told about it.\nWe then learn that, when Herod discovered that James’ death pleased the Jews, he detained Peter with the same intent. However, due to the fact that Peter was arrested during Passover (which would have made a public execution offensive to the very people he was trying to please), Herod left Peter in jail under the watch of four guards at a time. Peter was chained directly to two of them. On the last night of Passover, an angel loosed Peter’s chains and led him safely into the dark streets of Jerusalem. \nThese two encounters with Herod leave us asking, “Why did Peter live and James die?” Sure, Acts tells us people prayed for Peter’s safety (12:12), but can’t we assume they prayed just as fervently for James? So why did James die and not Peter? \nDon’t we often ask similar questions about our own lives? Why am I going through what I’m going through when my neighbor isn’t?\nThe rest of the chapter (vv. 19-25) answers the question: How much power did Herod really have over James and Peter? Can anyone, regardless of their influence, wealth, or fame, cross the limits God appoints? No. Not even Herod. How can we be so sure? When Herod denied giving God the glory due His name, God struck him down (Acts 12:23).\nJohn Stott observed, “This chapter opens with James dead, Peter in prison, and Herod triumphing; it closes with Herod dead, Peter free, and the Word of God triumphing.” \nAs ominous as Herod must have been, he was just a man, and his attempt to derail the Church amounted to less than a kid trying to derail a train with a nerf gun. This ruler who appeared so powerful was gone in a moment, but the Word of God still stands.\nIt can be unsettling to live in uncertainty, but there is nothing for it. We simply don’t get to know all that we’d like to. But we can rest in this: God determines the number of our days, and we cannot pass the limits He has appointed. There is no safer place to be than under His wise providence.\nWritten By Russ Ramsey \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    This year, the world will be watching the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. My family and friends will be watching in America, and of course we’ll be rooting for the Americans. And why wouldn’t we? They’re a part of us. They represent us. As the games unfold, we’ll get to know their stories and we’ll track their accomplishments. We’ll hope to be near the top of the medal count leaderboard, and we’ll take pride in our athletics.\nThe United States has won 2,401 Olympic medals. With a population of 313 million, that translates into one medal for every 130,000 people. That medal per population number puts the US 37th on the list! Did you think that rank would be higher? We’re winning a lot of medals, but we have a ton of people to choose from; so our numbers are high, and our efficiency is actually pretty low.\nTopping the charts is Finland at number one. They’ve won 302 medals with a population of 5.4 million for an index number of one medal for every 18,000 people. Then comes Sweden, Hungary, Denmark and the Bahamas (only 11 medals but only a population of 353,000 people, so that’s one medal for every 32,000 people). It will take the US winning a lot of medals to gain ground on Finland, but I’ll still root for that to happen.\nIs it right that we root for our own country? Every person competing in the Olympics has a story, regardless of the flag they represent. Each person has to fight some battle to get to this point. Our athletes are not automatically better—better people with better stories. \nStill, we all have a bias toward some people over other people. Rooting for what we know makes sense to us. And though we don’t often see it this bias, we inherit it. We sustain it. We buy into it. We promote it. \nThese inherent biases are at the forefront of what was happening in Acts 11. In Peter’s world, there was a dividing line between Jews and Gentiles. The two groups were separate. But when salvation came to Cornelius’s house, and when he, a Gentile, received the Holy Spirit, it broke through a cultural barrier that had stood in many people’s minds for centuries. The barrier was the idea that the God of Israel belonged to the people of Israel. Even Peter himself needed some convincing of the reach of the gospel (Acts 11:8-9).\nCornelius’s salvation was not only cause for God’s people to open their minds to the idea that the gospel could reach beyond what they imagined, but it was also cause to celebrate. Jews were not just called to accept the conversion of Gentiles, but to root for it.\nHaving biases is natural, but God calls us to what is supernatural. He calls us to a different way. He calls us not to see everyone as the same and without any distinction, but to love people as they are—in, with, and through the love of Christ. He calls us to see ourselves as people in need of the grace and mercy and Christ, and to extend that same mercy and grace to everyone. \nWe may all nod our heads to that, but Acts 11 pushes us to do something about it. It shows us that life in the good news of the gospel is not business as usual. The gospel transforms us.\nWhat might this look like? We might root for someone else besides those in our own tribe. Or appreciate what others contribute. The gospel calls us to set aside our own rights, privileges, and prejudices for something even better—God’s glory in His church. \nLet’s look for ways to do that.\nWritten By Doug Serven\n \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    A white sheet, heavy with livestock and lowered from the heavens, is a surprising way to communicate equality. But this vision from God came to Peter as an alarming and powerful announcement of freedom. Like the ceremonially unclean animals in the sheet, we also are unclean in our sin, except that God, being rich in mercy, credits to us His righteousness and makes us clean. \nAll men come to salvation by grace, and grace alone, Jew and Gentile alike.\nAlthough God shows no partiality, we are always at risk of judging by false standards (Acts 10:34). God’s ways are higher than our ways, and He calls us to set aside our inclinations toward human partiality. \nOur inclination to partiality is rooted in a selfish narrowness of perspective and a great underestimation of God’s grace. Like Peter, we find the ordinary needs of human frailty intruding on our prayers. Like Peter, when God gives us instruction and direction, we are often, at first, perplexed. I wish I could say that, like Peter, I am quick to respond in obedience, but that is often not the case. Instead, I like to understand what I’m doing before I do it. I want answers and clarity before I walk forward in faith. I want to manage God’s grace.\nBut God’s grace is mysterious, and it intrudes upon our lives in the most unexpected ways. Here in Acts we see a striking example of God’s unexpected and intrusive grace. \nFirst, we see that God is working at all times, everywhere. As Peter goes about his day, God has already sent an angelic vision to a devout centurion named Cornelius, who would summon Peter to bring the gospel to the Gentiles (Acts 10:3-9), so that “all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God” (Is. 52:10).\nSecond, God often provides what we need to know one step at a time (Acts 10:16-17, 29).  Peter’s calling is not a step-by-step instruction. God calls Peter to walk in faith, by the Spirit, rather than by sight.\nThird, God has already prepared the way. Notice that when Peter arrives at the house of Cornelius, he’s not sure what to do. When Cornelius says, “We are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord” (Acts 10:33), Peter did not have a prepared talk. But God prepared Peter long beforehand with the words to say. Peter’s job was simply to bear witness of Christ, to preach the gospel (Acts 10:33, Matt. 28:19).\nFourth, God’s work is His doing, not ours. God has graciously invited us into the joy of participating in what He is doing, but the work is ultimately His. Indeed, we read that “while Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word” (Acts 10:44). Peter had not even finished his brief sermon, and God was already working. The Gentiles were not won over by Peter’s persuasiveness or eloquence, but by the Word of God and the work of His Spirit.\nWhat a glorious reminder this is. Because God is at work, because His grace is surprising and sufficient, because His Spirit is active and enlivening, we can, like Peter, enter into the work of the Kingdom with great joy and confidence. We need not be hindered by uncertainty, nor worried about what we will say (Matt. 10:19).  God is always at work, and we have the great joy and privilege of proclaiming His salvation to a world in need, “preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ” (Acts 10:36).\nWritten By Caleb Faires \n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Have you ever seen a dead body? Maybe at a visitation or wake? It’s a strange experience, especially if you knew the person. In death they cease being the person you knew. Something is absent, and they look like a mannequin version of the person you loved. When life ends, the person is gone and what is left is but a shell.\nDeath is final. What’s the old joke? The two things you can count on in life are death and taxes. But try to imagine a scenario where death is not final, when it’s an intermission but not the end of the story. That’s hard to do, isn’t it?\nSomehow, that’s what we see in Acts 9. After Peter visited Aeneas, who had been paralyzed for eight years, and healed him in the name of Jesus, Peter was summoned to a nearby town. A beloved saint named Tabitha had passed away. Her friends were stricken. She was the sweetest, gentlest, most generous woman they knew, and now she was gone forever.\nYou’d expect Peter to comfort them with hope for the future and reminders of the resurrection. He might sit with them and be a good pastor who listens and cares. But what he actually does is, well, unusual. Peter goes into the room where Tabitha’s shell of a body is laid out and prepared for burial, sends everyone away, and prays over her. She’s gone, Pete. What’s the point?\nIn that moment he must have thought back to the time he saw his Savior do the same thing in the room of a young girl who had died. He must have remembered that Jesus not only raised that girl with a word but that He also rose from the dead Himself. Peter must have realized that when Jesus sent the Holy Spirit, it was for more than preaching and speaking in tongues. It was a spirit of power—the Spirit of Christ. Besides, hadn’t he just seen a man healed days before? \nSo Peter prayed with a certainty that death was not final.\nTabitha awoke. Her intermission ended and her story continued. She went from waxen to awakened, from absent to present.\nYou know what’s amazing about this story (aside from the woman rising from the dead)? The same Holy Spirit Peter depended on, who breathed life into a corpse, is with us today. All who follow Christ have the Holy Spirit. \nNo, we may never heal a paralytic or raise the dead, but the Spirit did raise the dead when He brought us from spiritual death to life. We have life because of the same miraculous power that brought a little girl and a woman back from the dead.\nWritten By Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I like to remind the members of our church that three of the foremost authors of Scripture were murders: Moses, David, and Paul. This is important. The grace of God can only be understood adequately against the background of our own unworthiness. Of these three men, the grace of God is most fully displayed in the conversion and calling of the one who would come to be known as “the Apostle Paul.”\nWhile Saul of Tarsus was on his way to arrest Christians in Damascus, Jesus arrested him and brought him to his knees. There is something wonderful about the way God’s sovereign grace is displayed here. Saul did nothing to contribute to his own redemption. He was not seeking after Jesus; rather, he was seeking to destroy the work of Jesus (Acts 9:5). \nThe conversion of Saul is a beautiful picture of the interruption of grace. Jesus interrupted Saul’s ambitions and plans. Jesus invaded Saul’s life in order to remake him.\nBlinded and brought to his knees, Saul cried out, “Who are you Lord?” (v. 5) and “What would you have me do” (v. 6)? These are the two questions that all men must ask. The answers to these two questions are the ground upon which the Christian life is built. Saul learned the answers to those questions on that particular day on the Damascus Road. When Jesus reveals Himself to us, we also learn the answers to those questions in our spiritual experience.\nWe can, however, see another aspect of grace in Saul’s Damascus Road experience. \nThere was converting grace on the Damascus Road, but there was also calling grace. The day of Saul’s redemption was the day of his being called by Christ into gospel ministry. What more grand display of God’s grace than that He should take the chief persecutor of the Church and make him into the chief laborer in the Church for the salvation of the nations.\nHaving sent Saul to be baptized by a believer named Ananias, Jesus revealed His plan for Saul. He explained to Ananias that this one who had persecuted the church was, “a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel” (v. 15). How amazing that God’s converting grace is followed by His calling grace. Not only does God redeem the worst of sinners, His grace can make them instantly useful in His kingdom.\nThis usefulness would not come without suffering. We know how much the great Apostle Paul did ultimately suffer for the name of Christ (v. 16); but, we also see how he endured that suffering with joy and purpose.\nMany years after his conversion and calling, the Apostle Paul would reflect on his former life and see in it the purposes of God for the salvation of others. When writing to his young protégée, Timothy, Paul wrote: “for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life” (1 Tim. 1:16). \nWhen Jesus met Saul of Tarsus on the Damascus road, He made him the great example of the precious biblical truth, “where sin abounded, grace abounded much more” (Rom. 5:20). \nThis is the same grace we, too, rely upon.\nWritten By Nick Batzig \n\n                ",

This time serves to prepare our hearts for the Lord’s Table and provides an opportunity for reflection, confession, and connection with God.\nUsually the things that I’ve done come to mind much more quickly than the things that I’ve left undone. Nonetheless, I’m thankful when the Spirit of God calls to my attention sins of omission: things that I probably should’ve done, but for some reason or another neglected to do.\nWhen recounting the stoning of Stephen, Luke inserts a short clause that if we’re not careful, we can easily read over: “And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul” (Acts 7:58b). This seems like an unusual detail to include, but it actually tells us quite a bit about Saul’s involvement.\nThe men who stoned Stephen had entrusted themselves to the authority and oversight of Saul. While he probably did not physically cast a stone at Stephen, Saul was present, approving, and guilty by inaction (Acts 8:1). He had given his stamp of approval to the persecution and martyrdom of Stephen (and presumably many other early believers).\nWhen Saul finally encountered the resurrected Jesus on the road to Damascus, he needed to seek repentance not merely for the evil things he had done (which were many), but also for things that he’d left undone. The conversion of Saul to Paul is one of the miraculous events recorded in the New Testament, and it is also one of the most encouraging. It’s a demonstration to all of us that God can use anyone, no matter their past.\nNo matter what you’ve done, or left undone, there is mercy, forgiveness, and redemption to be found. Maybe you’ve stood idly by when someone needed a hand. Maybe you’ve failed to act in love in a difficult situation. Maybe you turned a blind eye to a situation you knew was just plain wrong. Regardless of the circumstance, there is great hope and grace abundant for all who ask.\nSaul spent a good chunk of his life ignoring and actively contributing to the persecution of God’s people, yet God forgave him and eventually raised him up to a position of leadership.\nEach time I find myself in a moment of confession, corporate or otherwise, I also find myself in a place of deep gratitude and thankfulness. There is joy in asking for forgiveness and receiving it with no strings attached. For what we have done, and for what we have left undone, for our deepest regrets and failures, we ask forgiveness in the name of Jesus Christ, and He gives it. \nLord give us the strength and peace that we need to delight in Your will and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your name. Amen.\nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

The preacher (I grew up Baptist, and Baptists have preachers) would find three main points, or hooks, in a passage, and hang his thoughts on them. Then he’d select a few lines from a poem as a sort of wrap-up to everything. These lines were the coup-de-grace, the mercy blow designed to cause us to engage in self-examination, and respond publicly and accordingly during the invitation (a.k.a, tons of verses of “Just As I Am”). \nI guess the Baptists stole this sermon approach from Stephen though. Just so you know, Stephen’s sermon in Acts 7 was his last, his coup-de-grace designed to cause the listeners to look at their hearts. They did, then picked up stones and killed the young preacher, just as he was.\nHere’s the outline of Stephen’s sermon.\n\nTHIS LAND IS YOUR LAND (WELL, IN 400 YEARS) – As Stephen started his sermon (and it was a doozy), he went straight for the jugular. He talked about how prominent the LAND had become in the mind of his audience. To be fair, Israel had to wait a long, long, long time for the land God had promised Abraham. But the land became a “thing” overshadowing the Giver of the “thing.” In other words, the land had become an idol. This did not sit well with God.\n\nWHO’S YOUR DADDY? – Near the end of those long 400 years, the children of Israel got sloppy and blurred their worship of the one, true God by constructing TEMPLES for the many false gods of war and sex. Those temples took on the nature of a “thing” or idol. God their Father wasn’t pleased with this behavior, but He let them continue on and suffer the consequences of their wandering.\n\nEYES BUT DON’T SEE – Interestingly enough, the Israelites had a tabernacle of the covenant LAW with them all that time, built to the exact specifics God had provided to Moses. And while for a season it did represent the presence of the Almighty, it was not the Almighty. It was a “thing” that eventually became an idol, and we know God demands no other gods/idols/things before Him. In fact, that was the very first line written on the tablets of the Law, they just couldn’t see it.\n\n\n\nDON’T FENCE ME IN (closing poem; use expressive voice)\nHowever, the Almighty does not live in houses made by carpenters or masons, never has, never will. As the poetic prophet wrote:\n“Heaven is my throne,\n  and the earth is my footstool.\nWhat kind of house will you build for me?\n  says the Lord.\nOr where will my resting place be?\n  Has not my hand made all these things?”\nLet us pray.\nWritten By John Blase\n\n                ",

In my mind, I effortlessly partition off the spiritual things from the practical day-to-day busyness of life. The here and now, the schedules, and the tasks can easily overwhelm my day, crowding out my seemingly less urgent but vitally important spiritual life. \nToday’s Scripture describes an intensely practical and urgent matter: the Hellenist widows were being neglected. The dualist in me sees this as an administrative task, needing a real nuts and bolts solution. Surely, the next best step is to look over the resumes and pick the most qualified people to deal with the issue. \nBut the apostles carefully unfold the criteria: they seek men “of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom” (Acts 6:3). The spiritual health of these men was their first concern. The apostles certainly didn’t overlook natural gifting and skill; we see very clearly that they differentiated between their own calling to serve in preaching and the calling of these men to serve with their hands. But there is no dividing line between the practical things and the spiritual things. \nOne of these men, Stephen, a man of very practical gifting, proved to be one of the most potent witnesses in the early church. His opposers “could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking” (Acts 6:10). What was the root of his powerful witness? It was not his earthly talents, his intellect, or his cunning. Indeed, we find in this passage echoes of Acts 4:13, where Peter and John, ordinary and unschooled men, nonetheless spoke with power and conviction. The Jewish rulers, we are told, “took note that these men had been with Jesus.” So also, Stephen’s witness was born of his walk with Christ. \nToo often, we neglect the weightier matters. We operate by an earthly wisdom, being sure to tidy our workspaces, balance our checkbooks, and organize our tools, long before we get on our knees, open our Bibles, and sit at the feet of Christ. Is it any wonder that our countenance falls? (Gen. 4:6) \nThe first and most urgent matters are those of the heart. When our hearts are filled with the Spirit, we are then prepared for even the most practical matters.\nThe content of our hearts shows up in our hands, on our faces, and in our words. Though for a while men may pretend and even deceive many, what is inside always comes out. When Stephen faced his accusers, he did not wilt at their accusations. Rather, the whole assembly could see that his face shone brightly. \nMay we walk with Christ and be filled with His Spirit, and may His light shine in us, that we may be faithful serve with “great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus” (1 Tim. 3:13).\nWritten By Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

We worked with kids from the Dominican Republic in Washington Heights. I’m from Alabama and hadn’t experienced anything like NYC. I was blown away. The whole time I walked around that huge city, I marveled at how different it was. This was especially true in Washington Heights where all the signs were in Spanish. I remember thinking, “This is a totally different world.”\nWhen I read Acts 5:17-42, I feel like I am reading about a world that is different from my own.\nThe world of Acts was a world of persecution. In the Western world, we don’t have to worry about this. We can teach and preach and even those who do not like what we say will leave us alone. They will not beat us and put us in prison. It’s a very different world indeed.\nBut that is not what seems so otherworldly to me. What Strikes me most is how they respond to the imprisonment and the beating.\nThe apostles are arrested and put in prison. Then to everyone’s great relief, they are supernaturally freed by an angel. But instead of enjoying their freedom, they go out and preach again, doing the very thing that got them put in prison in the first place. So, they are brought in again and beaten before being released.\nThere is no record of complaint. No cries of injustice. No plans for revenge. No, they rejoice because they have been treated terribly, just like the One they follow.\nTheir response to being imprisoned? They go back out and publicly preach Jesus. Their response to being beaten? Joy, because they had suffered like Jesus.\nThese apostles lived in a world so foreign to the world I live in. I live comfortably in a world where I demand my rights and complain about my pain. I walk around in a world paved with expecting pity for hardship. But I don’t want to reside in that world.\nI want to reside in a world where my freedom is about Jesus and my suffering is about Jesus.\nMaybe you do too. How do we get there?\nIf you are anything like me, your first inclination will be to resolve to do better, to be more willing to do things that might bring on suffering. That’s not a terrible way of thinking, but if that’s all that drives me, I will just get worn down and give up. And that sounds like a world of my own making anyway.\nNo, sheer determination was not the thing that fueled the apostles’ desire to live for Jesus. They lived like this because they believed the gospel— to the point that it was their only hope for this life and the next, as the old confession says. They lived in a world where the gospel left no room for fear; where suffering couldn’t crowd out joy.\nOh, to live and believe in that world.\nWritten By Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Proverbs 9:10 says, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” Conversely then, the absence of the fear of the Lord is the heart of folly. Acts 5 tells the story of how a lack of the fear of the Lord led to ruin, and it is a hard passage. But any time God endeavors to instill in His people a reverential fear of His holiness, it is a gift, because God is and always shall be holy.\nWhat exactly did Ananias and Sapphira do wrong? As members of the church, they did what others were doing. They sold possessions and gave the proceeds to the apostles, who used those funds for the work of the church. (Barnabas had done the same thing.)\nAnanias decided to keep part of the proceeds for himself. This decision was not a sin. He was free to do that if he wanted. The end of Acts 4 tells us people were giving “what they had decided in their hearts to give.” This means that before God, people were thinking through what their contributions to the church should be, and giving accordingly. The apostles didn’t decide for them. Ananias was free to give what he wanted. He gave, and it was probably a lot of money.\nSo what was the sin? What Ananias and his wife had decided in their hearts to do was to deceive people and represent their gift as being larger than it truly was. When Ananias gave his offering, he led everyone to believe it was everything he had gained from the sale. As one pastor I know said, “Ananias wanted to look like an especially good Christian without actually having to be one.” It was this deception, not the amount he gave, which led to God’s judgment.\nAnanias and Sapphira died as the result of their sin. They are the only two we hear of this happening to in Acts, although no doubt countless others had committed and continue to commit very similar sins. But the writer of Acts tells us that as each one died, all who heard of it were filled with fear.\nWe, too, should listen. \nIf God is Holy, if God is all-powerful, if God’s demand for righteousness could be satisfied only by the sacrifice of Christ on our behalf, then we should fear Him.\nAnd if we are prone to forget that God is Holy, then it is gracious of God to call our hearts to fear Him. If we are prone to seek glory for ourselves, though God alone is to be glorified in our lives, it is grace that teaches our hearts to fear. If we are prone to live as though God isn’t really real, it is grace that He should arrest our hearts with a fear of His holy, present power.\nThe fear of the holiness of God is a gift because God is, in fact, holy. To regard Him as anything less is to miss who He really is. \nThe sober story of Ananias and Sapphira invites us to commune with God as He is—the holy One who created the heavens and Who knows our names—the Lover of our souls. May He give us the gift of a holy fear.\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

We love to see transformations, and we want to know how we, too, can be transformed.\nScripture has its own collection of striking “before and after” pictures. That of the pre- and post-Pentecost Simon Peter might be one of the most significant—and significantly overlooked—transformations in the Bible. Before Pentecost, we see Simon Peter denying the Savior, while warming himself at the fire outside of the High Priest’s palace. But after Pentecost, we find Simon Peter boldly proclaiming Jesus and the resurrection inside that very same palace.\nWhat changed? What happened to bring about this radical transformation? In short, it was the power of the death and resurrection of Jesus applied by the Holy Spirit to Peter’s heart.\nPeter tasted the grace and redemption that is found only in Christ when Jesus restored him (John 21:15-19). After his restoration, this man who had been so timid and fearful to bear witness to Christ was emboldened to proclaim that same grace and redemption to everyone he met. He was now unashamed of the fact that “there is salvation in none other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12) because he himself had become an object of that salvation.\nWhen we have our souls restored by Christ, we are eager to proclaim His excellencies for the salvation of those around us. Rather than seeking to please ourselves, we seek to bring glory to the One who alone is qualified to be the Redeemer.\nThe healing of the lame man was the event that sparked Peter’s sermon to the rulers who arrested him (Acts 3). Peter, together with John, told the people and rulers that God had performed this miracle through them as an attestation of the resurrection power of Jesus. Just as Jesus’ own miracles proved His Messianic kingdom and power, so too did the miracles that Christ worked through His apostles.\nThe end result of the healing of the lame man was that it brought glory to Christ by highlighting the essential fact that salvation is found in Him alone. This is always the end result when God works through His people. Peter and John had not performed that miracle by their own wisdom or power. They had not even received formal theological education. But they had been with Jesus, and that was all that mattered!\nIf we have tasted and seen that the Lord is gracious, we too will be eager to tell others about Christ. When we recognize that the One who has saved us by His grace is the only Savior of sinners, we will want to tell others where they too can find this salvation. \nOur own experience of redemption in Christ should fuel our zeal to hold Christ forth as the only way of salvation. May God use the “before and after” pictures of our lives to bring glory to the only Savior of men.\nWritten By Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I have a tough time with some televangelists. It’s not so much that they’re on TV, but when their message sounds more like crowdsourcing, I get a little uneasy. Recently, one such leader garnered a great deal of attention because he said he believed God was calling him to raise sixty-five million dollars for a private jet. This is not a joke. This really happened.\nWhile there are pastors and teachers using television as a positive medium, it’s difficult to think that a sixty-five million dollar jet (for example) was being explicitly purchased to further the glory of God.\nWhat a contrast this draws to the very real healing and teaching ministry of Peter and John that we see in Acts 3. They were incredibly clear about their allegiance to God and the message He had given them. They healed not to gain attention or power, but because it was an imitation of the work of Christ.\nPeter exclaimed to the lame man: “I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!” (Acts 3:6). Not in Peter’s name, not in John’s name, but in Jesus’ name. That distinction is crucial.\nAs would probably happen today, a large crowd gathered around Peter and John in the wake of the miraculous healing. Again, we witness the apostles paying tribute to the plans and power of God. Peter proclaimed: “Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk? The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him” (Acts 3:13).\nThe “whys” and “hows” of physical healing and restoration are still a mystery to me, but what is clear is that Peter and John could not have brought healing apart from the power of God. Their mission had a distinct emphasis on making the name of Jesus great among the nations.\nPeter and John didn’t pull any punches about this mission when addressing the crowd. Instead of leveraging their moment in the spotlight for their own glory and gain, they actually risked quite a bit when they told the people that the very power which healed the lame man also was condemning the people for their lack of repentance.\nNo jets here, folks. In fact, I imagine Peter and John didn’t receive much of a love offering in exchange for their encouraging message.\nSo, what’s the point?\nThe sixty-five million dollar speck in our neighbor’s eye is often easier to see than the plank in our own. For you and me, the temptation to glorify our own names might be wrapped in seemingly benign packaging. \nWhen we invest in our family life or career, it’s easy to pay lip service to God. But all good things can become ways we seek to inflate our reputations and perceived importance. However, with the right posture, these relationships and actions can also work to give credit where credit is due. They can point back to God, the Giver of all good gifts.\nTo have the most meaningful impact, we have to worry about our success and influence less and less, and the gospel more and more. \nIf we are really committed to the work of following Jesus, it looks and feels like picking up our crosses and following Him. We get to participate in the resurrection, to be sure, but to get there we too have to die to ourselves, our desires, and our need to make our own kingdom great. For Christ to increase, we must decrease (John 3:30).\nWritten By Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When I was a child, I longed for Christmas Day more than anything else. This was, no doubt, partially on account of the expectation of opening the gifts my parents had so neatly wrapped and placed under the tree. But it was also because of the eager anticipation that it would snow on Christmas, spreading a white covering over everything outside our living room window. If that were not enough, our family would then spend the entire day together singing, reading, praying, and eating.\nThe combination of presents in our home, snow-covered fields outside, and the warmth of fellowship with loved ones made for a particularly wonderful—and now extremely nostalgic—experience. It was as if all the other days of the year built up to Christmas Day and existed to make it extraordinary.\nIn the same way, there was a special day in redemptive history on which God gave a combination of blessings to His people—the outpouring of the gift of the Spirit, the proclaiming of the gospel to the nations, and the new creation of a worshiping and fellowshipping community of believers. This was the day of Pentecost (Acts 2) and there was nothing like it in redemptive history.\nAnyone reading the New Testament must draw the conclusion that these were no ordinary times. The powerful events accompanying the outpouring of the Holy Spirit—as had been promised by Jesus—was part of His once-for-all saving work. In a very real sense, Pentecost belongs as much to the accomplishment of redemption as does the death, burial, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus.\nThe coming of the Spirit on Pentecost signaled several important things about the saving work of Jesus Christ. The details of the day of Pentecost in the book of Acts are meant to draw the believer’s mind back to the Exodus, when God led His people out of Egypt by means of the cloudy pillar by day and fiery pillar by night.\nAt Pentecost, the Spirit came down on the people of God and appeared as tongues of fire. We might envision hundreds of tiny pillars of fire coming down and resting on each of the disciples. This was, of course, signaling that God had come down—by virtue of the redemption He had accomplished in Christ—in the person of the Spirit to lead the true Israel through the wilderness of this world. At Pentecost, the Spirit was coming down on the living stones of the new Temple that God had raised up with Christ.\nThe gift of tongues also carries our minds back to the early chapter of Scripture where God came down in judgment and scattered the people of earth, confusing their languages (Gen. 11:1-9). Now, having fulfilled all things in Christ, the Lord came down in mercy to unite those who heard the “wonderful works of God” in Christ, each in their own language (Acts 2:4-12).\nThe uniting work of the Spirit of God through the preaching of the gospel to the nations, in turn, brought about the knitting together of a new community of believers. Those who believed the gospel were all together and had everything in common. These new converts sat at the feet of those who had been taught by Jesus (Acts 2:40-47).\nWhile there was something unique—a once-for-all-ness—about Pentecost, there is nothing unique about the ongoing work of Christ in giving His Spirit to His people for our redemption and sanctification, in sending His ministers to proclaim the gospel to the nations, or in His continuing to create a worshiping community of believers. This is the everydayness of the work of redemption. \nWritten By Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

But the opening chapter of Acts shows us it is not.\nA number of years ago, I went to my brother’s deployment ceremony for the Army. He was leaving his wife and daughter behind in the great state of Texas to spend a year in the Middle East as a soldier. The send-off was a sober event that involved many lengthy farewells.\nBut as the troops left the stadium, they didn’t immediately board a plane for Kuwait. Instead, they went to a military base seven miles away from my brother’s house, where they spent the next two weeks preparing to leave. So my brother was only a few miles away from his family, but might as well have been on the other side of the world. He said that was the hardest week of the year because he was stuck waiting so close to home.\nIn the first chapter of Acts, we find Jesus’ disciples waiting close to home. That must have been a difficult stretch. Jesus had risen from the grave and walked among His disciples for forty days, teaching them that the Holy Spirit would indwell the people of God and empower them for the work of building the Church around the world. And right before He ascended into heaven, He told His disciples to remain in Jerusalem and wait for the Holy Spirit. They waited there for 10 days.\nWhat are you waiting on now? Or better, how are you waiting? It’s hard to wait because waiting can feel wasteful, which also feels “unspiritual.”\nThe reality is that sometimes God calls us to wait on Him, and rather than the waiting being a time of inactivity, God uses these periods as times of preparation. What kind of preparation? For the disciples in Acts 1, it was preparation to be His witnesses. They spent their time in fellowship with one another (1:13-14), in devotion to the Lord (1:14), and in anticipation for how He would work through them when the time came—evidenced in their determination to shore up their group by replacing Judas (1:21-26).\nIf we believe that God is pleased to use our lives for His glory as His witnesses throughout the world, then even our seasons of building, establishment, and waiting are filled with significance. \nSo how do we wait well? We spend our time seeking the face of God, studying and obeying His Word. We spend time in fellowship together. We regard every day as a precious gift of time to spend in preparation for what He will do through us.\nAs we bear witness to Him, let us spend our time waiting for His return; for although He does not need to use us as His witnesses, He is pleased to use us as His witnesses by His grace and for His glory. \nMay we spend our lives in response to that grace.\nWritten By Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

It’s fine when they happen between episodes in a series; it keeps us watching, engaged, eager for what’s next. But when we are left dangling at the end of a season, I want to call my congressman. And don’t even get me started on a resolution-less movie. \nWe need closure. We need the closing notes of “shave and a haircut.” We want to hear the “two bits.” Conclusions help us understand the point of it all. Today, at the end of Romans, Paul gives us the resounding note for the letter to the Romans—a doxology of praise: “To Him be glory forever!” (Romans 16:27).\nEverything and everyone exists for the glory of God. Our churches, our ministries, our jobs, our entire lives are given to us for the glory of the triune God. Do you live this way, submitted to His Word and eagerly living for the fame of His name? What does that even mean? What is God’s glory? God’s glory is the “Godness” of God going public—it is what we see of Him that moves us to worship.\nHow do the heavens declare the glory of God? They display things like wonder and majesty. By faith, we see the creative power and brilliance of God as clouds wisp across our patch of sky, gliding to other coordinates on this blue marble dangling in the cosmos. God displays His glory all around us. We are meant to look for it—to see it, to align with it, to spread it.\nThe gospel teaches us that we are not the point of our own lives—God is. He saved us for our good and His glory. Living for the glory of God means we agree with who God says He is, and we align our lives accordingly. We submit and serve. We enjoy and exalt. \nJesus’ death for our sins and His resurrection for our new life enables and empowers us to behold the glory and fame of God, and to worship Him for it. “Your sins are forgiven for his name’s sake” (1 John 2:12 ESV). We, the forgiven ones, rejoice at God’s glory because we reap the blessings of it.\nThe glory of God lasts forever. It isn’t trendy. Nothing will outdo the awesomeness of God. Don’t live in cliffhanger-mode, wondering what your life is all about. Jesus redirects our lives to His—one forever aligned to the glory of God. “Not to us, Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory because of your faithful love, because of your truth” (Psalm 115: CSB).\nWritten by J.

In fact, he called himself a “horseboy.” In his memoir, Where Rivers Change Direction, he tells of how he and his father trained their horses to “show them their heads”—in other words, to pay attention or be expectant when they were around. Spragg tells of how he could walk into another man’s corral and know the man—by the way his horses lounged—to be a horse’s, well, rear.\nI grew up around churches and the preachers who led those churches. I was a preacher’s boy. At the risk of oversimplification, I found two kinds of preachers: those who would greet all the people before a service began, and those who would be sequestered away somewhere in an office, putting the final touches on a sermon or praying or whatever. I could walk into other men’s churches and know the man—by the way the congregation didn’t expect to be greeted by him—to possibly be a fine speaker who could untie theological knots, but not much of a friend.\nThe primary text for today emphasizes how important valuing one another is. We make much about the “last things” Jesus said, and so give great importance to the Great Commission at the conclusion of Matthew’s Gospel. If we’re going to be consistent, we must give equal importance to how Paul concludes the weighty letter known as Romans: “Greet one another” (Romans 16:16). \nThis is not some drive-by where you wave at the crowd and use words like “Hey, everybody” or “Bye, y’all.” No, this is personal. People are known by name (Phoebe, Rufus) and also by some details about them—“who risked their own necks for my life” or “my dear friend in the Lord.”\nDo you greet people by their names instead of “Hey”? Do you know details about the people you come in contact with every day? Do you know anything about their story—not everything, but at least a few things? I realize some men are naturally outgoing while other men are quiet, even shy. I’ve found that has little to do with being a man who greets well.\nYou can tell a lot about a man by walking into his places of influence, and watching to see if the people raise their heads and eyes, expecting to receive the gift of a greeting. \nIn the name of Jesus and for the sake of His gospel, greet one another.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

Other times, it’s the final sense of peace in a thrilling and uneasy storyline. In any case, the ending is most often the lasting impression of the work.\nPaul’s letter to the Romans is indeed a letter—it’s written as instruction and encouragement to its recipients. It has a greeting and a conclusion, and the meat of the letter is Paul’s teaching on various related subjects that the church in Rome was struggling with. Nonetheless, Paul is still telling a story with his letter.\nAs we have traced through this letter, we’ve seen the argument Paul has built: we’re all sinners deserving of death, but we are saved by grace through faith and God calls us to live in light of this fact. The death that sin brings is just as real as the life Jesus brings—but that life has swallowed up death. We can place our hope in this. This is our peace.\nAs Paul concludes the letter, he seems to tie a bow on the whole story. He’s not just saying goodbye to some friends; he’s leaving them with an ending to the story. He’s putting a final touch on the picture of God’s glory that he’s just painted.\nPaul thanks the church for their kindness, but he makes a greater point: the mission is bigger than just them (Romans 15:26-28). The blessings of Christ—this gospel Paul and all of us have been called to preach—is a worldwide mission. Paul needs to take the encouragement and support of the gospel to both the Jews and the Gentiles. The good news of the gospel, the blessing of Christ, is meant to reach every corner of the world (Matthew 28:18-20). So Paul concludes his letter by asking the Romans to pray for him, and to pray for the Spirit’s work in the world.\nDon’t overlook this conclusion. It is not an add-on to an otherwise majestic theological book. It is a theological statement about how the gospel is meant to move and work. The gospel is meant to come to us, and flow through us to others. This is what Paul wants for himself and for all believers. \nLet’s heed Paul’s request to the Romans and pray for the blessing of Christ to infiltrate the hearts of people all over the world.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    We are prone to look at success, both worldly and spiritual, as merit, rather than grace. Whenever I think I have grown spiritually, I am tempted to pat myself on the back and feel smug. My heart can take a generous compliment and turn it into entitlement in no time at all. But genuine spiritual growth doesn’t turn our eyes self-ward, nor does it set us on a pedestal to receive honor. Instead, spiritual maturity is manifested in humility and service. This is so because all of life is doxological; it is aimed at one thing: the praise of God.\nPaul opens this passage with a clear instruction that grows directly out of this doxological aim: strength, authority, power, and influence are not for self-gain or personal honor. In a culture of self-worship, this is a radical notion. But this radical idea is a hallmark of Christianity, for Christ did not please Himself. He exchanged glory for lowliness, power for humility, and even life for death. This is not just about earthly gains, wealth, and blessing, but about spiritual strength. \nFor those who follow Christ, Paul says, the life of service to others is not an option but an obligation, for Christ became a servant. Closeness to Christ leads to the building up of the saints in harmony. It produces the fruit of love and service, not of self-serving pride.\nFor this reason, Paul declares, “I would not dare say anything except what Christ has accomplished through me” (Romans 15:18). How easy it might have been for Paul to claim honors for himself for the success of his ministry! But Paul’s great legacy as an apostle to the Gentiles came about because of the grace given him by God. The root and the fruit of the Christian life are all of grace, so that no man may boast except in the work of Christ. Therefore, where grace is at work, gratefulness, service, encouragement and harmony results. \nChrist’s glorious humility brought salvation to Jew and Gentile alike, that all nations might bring Him praise. For great is His steadfast love toward us, and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever. \nWhen we see the glories of the gospel, delivered to an undeserving and needy people, our tongues are set free to echo God’s praises. May the God of hope fill us with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit we may abound in hope, to the praise of His glory.\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Remember when you first got your driver’s license? All that freedom, all that road, all that speed. You could go anywhere and do anything—except break curfew or give rides to other teens or to girls or speed or run red lights or take long road trips. Freedom has its limits, at least it ought to, especially to protect the less mature.\nIn Romans 14 we see a scenario in which freedom and limits are again in tension. Now that the Old Testament laws of cleanliness and purification were in the past, it meant that any food or drink was pure, so people were digging in. But this caused issues for other believers still more closely connected to the old ways. Their consciences were pricked by this new freedom—it felt wrong to eat or drink these new things, or even be in proximity to them.\nSo on one side we have people exercising their freedom in Christ. On the other side we have people abiding by their consciences. Both good things, but in tension.\nPaul brings the tension back to the heart. He points out that food and drink are not the issue. The issue is love. People on one side were prioritizing their freedom above the hearts of fellow believers and causing them to struggle. He points out that, clean or not, if food or drink is seen as questionable by someone, then for that person to consume it would be sin. The liberated person should set aside their freedom temporarily in order to show love.\nThe church is a body and a family. When one part works in conflict with another, it breaks down. One person’s freedom in Christ cannot be a license to push another person into conflict with their conscience. All actions, attitudes, and convictions in the church must be done and held in such a way as to build up and support. They must pursue love. \nThe self-sacrifice of setting aside liberties is an indication of spiritual maturity. It shows that love for brothers and sisters is of greater value than one’s own freedom or pleasure.\nBelievers are no longer under the old law, but neither can we grab our freedoms and revel in them for our own happiness at the expense of others. We are free because of God’s profound love and grace through Jesus, so love and grace and Christlikeness must be the marks of our freedom. \nSometimes we will revel and eat or drink to our great pleasure. Other times we will sacrifice our freedoms for the sake of our brothers and sisters who have yet to discover the guilt-free freedom of Jesus. This is true maturity proven by love.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    A Christian is to honor God with all the decisions he makes. This means our decisions—what to wear, eat, watch, etcetera—should not be first and foremost about what we like or want, but about what God likes or wants. In whatever we do, “we live to the Lord” (Romans 14:8; 1 Corinthians 10:31).\nSimply put, personal preference cannot be the ultimate arbiter of our decisions. We may like how certain clothes look or feel, and that’s good; but the first question we must ask is, “Will this honor God?” We may like certain foods for their nutrition or taste, but the primary consideration is, “Will this be pleasing to the Lord?”\nNow, I have good news for you: God is pleased with a LOT of different clothes and foods. From togas to t-shirts, He gives us great liberty. The same is true of food. You can go for the green smoothie or hit up Five Guys for a juicy hamburger. Both are well within the scope of God’s pleasure.\nOf course, as you make these decisions, principles of modesty, stewardship, freedom, and wisdom are in play. Paul reminds us elsewhere that, though something may be permissible, it is not always profitable (1 Corinthians 10:23). You have things to think about when you pick out that garment or order from that menu. Your life is not your own (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). In all our decisions, we must honor God and love those around us.\nBut remember, it’s a problem if we begin to judge others by our own particular convictions and choices when the Lord has given them freedom. Or worse, when we demand that others conform to our convictions when Scripture demands we extend liberty.\nLet me go back to the food illustration. Maybe today you’re munching on carrots and celery for lunch out of a commitment to be a good steward your physical body (Matthew 25:14-30), while your fellow Christian coworker across the table downs a cheeseburger as an expression of freedom and a celebration of the cleanliness of all foods (Acts 9:10-16). Which one of you is right? Don’t answer—it’s a trick question. You both have a biblical basis for the particular choices you’ve made, and you can both honor the Lord in the decisions you’ve made. What’s essential is that you are “fully convinced in your own mind” (Romans 14:5) and that you open-heartedly welcome the other’s convictions as well (Romans 14:1-3).\nWe live this way because God has already “welcomed” both carrot and burger eaters into the kingdom of Jesus Christ. It is only through grace, not perfect decision-making, that we will be able to stand at the end of time (Romans 14:4). And so we follow St. Augustine’s old dictum, “Love God and do what you will.”\nWhen Jesus is the true unifying point of community life, wine connoisseurs sit down with teetotalers and there’s not a hint of judgment. Meat eaters break bread with vegetarians, and neither looks down their nose at the other. \nWhen we’ve truly tight-gripped the gospel, we gain the liberty to hold many other things loosely, or freely. And that’s just how God would have it. \nWritten by Nate Shurden\n\n\n                ",

You know that feeling, the one where you look at the clock on your bedside table and you realize you’re already a half-hour late to that crucial meeting or final exam? Panic sets in, and your entire day feels completely thrown off.\nDid you know that it’s possible to be spiritually asleep? Elsewhere in his letters, Paul seems to use this language to describe those who are either physically or spiritually dead, but here in Romans 13 he seems to be addressing believers (“…nearer now than when we first believed.”). Paul is worried that his readers are going to miss key encounters with the Spirit and power of God because of their spiritual complacency. This concern, of course, extends to us too.\nPaul cautions the church in Rome because he can see a cycle forming. Spiritual complacency and sleepiness is not a singular issue, but rather one that ripples outward. When you atrophy spiritually, it affects many of your decisions, which in turn further diminishes your spiritual strength. The cycle Paul is worried about in Romans 13 looks something like this: Spiritual apathy leads to compromising sin choices. These behaviors lead to a more spiritually numb life, which leads to more bad choices, and so goes the cycle.\nPerhaps you’ve felt yourself stuck in a pattern like this. It can feel like being trapped on a treadmill where you have no control over the speed. Thankfully, Paul calls us all to a different, more fruitful way of living. “Rather, put on the Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 13:14 ESV). Another translation reads, “clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ” (NIV). \nBreaking the cycle of spiritual sleep and unhealthy choices starts with a change in our understanding of who we are. We are meant to see ourselves under, in, and through the life and work of Jesus Christ and His calling over us. With this shift of our internal compass and posture, we are able to combat the cycle of spiritual sleep and distance from God.\nIf you’re reading this and feel like you’ve overslept, the good news is that it’s never too late to break your cycle or get back on track. You are a new creation and can be “clothed with the Lord.” In that place of spiritual redemption, you can choose this day “to put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light” (Romans 13:12). One of the thieves on the cross next to Jesus found this to be true in his final moments. It is never too late to make Jesus the fullness of your identity. \nTake that step today.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

The opposite is actually true. In fact, Darcy had been generous to a fault with Wickham, and Wickham chose a prodigal lifestyle without ever returning gratitude. In the movie, as he is telling the story, there is a scene of him walking in on Wickham, who is with a woman. And the look on Darcy’s face is one of barely being able to look at what’s happening in front of him because of how evil it is.\nScene 2: There is a scene in The Road by Cormac McCarthy when the son asks the father if they are still the good guys. The father had done something to protect them, and the son was unsure if they were still on the side of good. I’ve read this book now at least five times. Each time I am moved by this scene. In McCarthy’s nightmare, where so much evil is surrounding them and demanding things from them, this young boy is concerned about him and his father being the good guys.\nI think those two scenes sum up pretty well what Paul is wanting from the Roman Christians and from us in today’s passage. Paul wants us to regard evil as though it is hard to look upon, not because we are judging people and looking down on them in their sin, but because we know the harm evil does. \nThis is reason Christ died: to defeat evil once and for all. We are called to detest evil—like Darcy.\nPaul wants us also to cling to what is good—the way McCarthy’s boy clung to a desire to be good in the midst of a world where the darkness of evil and suffering and hurt had descended like an ever-present fog. In that scene, McCarthy’s apocalyptic world is not so different from the one we know at present. We’re called to cling to what is good.\nWhere do we get help to live out Romans 12:9? At the foot of the most evil act that did the most good: the Cross. The focal point of the gospel is the ultimate act of evil, and God’s ultimate act of detesting it and doing the ultimate good.\nThere, at the cross, sin was defeated. Above every event that ever was, this one is good beyond all human measurement. When we need help detesting evil and clinging to what is good, we can cling to the cross and hold fast.\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    What does it mean to be a living sacrifice? Consider a couple of everyday examples: marriage and parenthood.\nMarriage and parenthood are two of the most significant relationships people have in life. They are also two of the most demanding. Both ask for sacrifices not fully known before the “big day.” How many times have you talked with engaged couples or expectant parents and listened as they painted a glorious picture of what they thought their upcoming life would look like? And if you are already down those roads a bit, how many times have you heard this and thought, They just can’t see how many surprises await. \nIf you have traveled the road of marriage or parenthood for any significant distance, you know what’s involved. You know the coordination, the patience, and the sacrifice required. I remember a few years ago when talking with an engaged couple. The husband-to-be said, “You married people are sometimes the worst advertisements for marriage.” Surprised, I asked what he meant. He said married people often seem to take it upon themselves to warn young engaged couples about how hard marriage is. \nOf course, some of the “advice” is terrible, like: “Are you sure you really want to give your life to serve someone else?” “You really don’t know what you are signing up for.” “There goes your freedom.”\nMarriage is a sacrifice. No one argues that point. Sadly, those who make comments like these don’t seem to get the joy of living as a sacrifice. Laying down your life for another is a learned joy; it comes from humility, from valuing the other more than yourself.\nMarriage and parenthood are challenging. They are examples of the biblical call for self-sacrifice. But sacrifice is a beautiful challenge. When we sacrifice for the right things, we are shaped into a humble people, and joy is the result.\nIn our Scripture today, God calls us to be a living sacrifices (Romans 12:1). This is a beautiful thing—living while sacrificing. Just like the engaged couple that is unaware of the joyful sacrifices ahead of them, the Christ follower is also blissfully unaware of the joy that awaits him when he learns to function as a living sacrifice.\nFollowing Jesus costs us everything, but it gives us everything we really need, too. Consider what it means to present your bodies as living sacrifices, and take courage in the beautiful challenge of resting in Christ in deeper ways than you ever thought possible.\nWritten by Jason Tippetts\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    A couple months ago, I was talking with my mom about how we do allowances for our kids. I said to her, “Remember how you used to do it when I was a kid? You’d put all those little sticky notes on the fridge with chores and dollar values on them, and we’d take them off and put them in a pile as we did them?” \nMom said, “Oh, we tried all kinds of things.” \n“Really? That’s all I remember,” I said, surprised. \n“I think we tried that method out for a few weeks, but that’s it.”\nIt’s funny how we remember the passage of time, isn’t it? There are things I did as a kid for only a few weeks which I remember as having done for years on end. Now a parent myself, I try all sorts of things with my own kids that might only last a week or two, but I bet when they’re grown they’ll have memories of some of those things and think we did them all the time.\nHere’s my point: the older get we, the more trouble we have remembering how things actually happened. We compress timelines. We think we did certain things all the time when we actually didn’t. And some things we did do all the time, we may have forgotten entirely. We can begin to lose our hold on the foundational truths of what really happened. \nThis is not so with God.\nIn today’s passage from Romans, Paul reminds his readers that God has been at work among His people for a long, long time. The Christian faith is undergirded with realities that have stood since before we were born and will remain long after we’re gone. \nGod has given gifts and issued calls to His people that we are likely to forget. Paul’s point is this: Whether we remember them or not, God’s gifts and callings stand. Our memory of them, or lack thereof, does not erase them.\nGod’s gifts are what He gives us, the His calling is where He leads us. In our passage, Paul is referring to the gifts God gave Israel (listed in Romans 9:4 as “the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple service, and the promises”) and their calling, which is the promise of salvation. These, Paul says, are irrevocable.\nAs with Israel, God gives us both an eternal calling to the life to come, as well as gifts to use in this life here and now. We cannot “forget” them away. Passages like Romans 11:25-36 remind us that God has been at work since the beginning of time. God knows our hard-heartedness and sin better than we remember it, and He gives us a mercy greater than we suspect we need.\nAdmit that your memory, when it comes to sin and grace, can sometimes get a little fuzzy. And when you do, rest in the fact that God’s promises do not hinge on our ability to remember them. He remembers them perfectly, and they are irrevocable.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

Sure, our favorite team may have won the series, the game, or what have you—but the fans? Did they win too? In a real way, yes they did. They were a part of the experience. There was a bond between the team and its fans, which facilitated a shared moment of joy.\nBut imagine a fan bragging about his victory more than the team’s MVP does. Picture him filled with pride, talking himself up, discounting Tom Brady’s feats in the Super Bowl, or LeBron James’s guts in the NBA Finals. It seems a bit ridiculous, doesn’t it?\nAs crazy as it seems to think that we not only help our teams win, but deserve the trophy too—how insane is it for us overlook God’s grace when we think about our own standing in this life? \nThe Lord’s offer to save sinners through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is a total act of God. Our efforts bring nothing to His saving grace. We can’t muscle our way into the New Covenant. God’s kindness is at work in our salvation. He sustains us. This is what we celebrate. His victory is our victory.\nAs men, we are often tempted to compare ourselves to others, seeking a little ego boost to make ourselves feel better. We wrongly think we are more worthy of salvation than others. We may even believe God saved us because of all the great things we offer to His cause. But salvation is about a God who is rich in mercy, even when we were dead in our sins. \nPaul reminds us that apples don’t keep the apple tree going. The fruit doesn’t sustain the root. It works the other way around. There is no place for pride in the Christian life. We boast, not in ourselves, but in the cross—in Christ’s death for our sins (Galatians 6:14).\nWhenever we are tempted to crank up our self-importance, we must remember that God’s kindness is what justifies our entire lives. Knowing the gospel, reading and enjoying the Bible, serving in the Lord’s name—these are all launched and sustained by His kindness. God gets the credit. He saved you. He is saving you. He will save you. \nEnjoy and exult in God’s kindness. Rely on His strength. It’s the only way to live.\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n                ",

I’m suspicious of everything that bangs my eardrums. \nDiscerning fact from fiction in this digital age is now a full-time but necessary job. The whole intent behind fake news is the spread of misinformation, hoaxes, bogus stories, or whatever you want to call them. It’s not that this is some new phenomenon, but that the reality of social media brings an ease of spreading the stuff like never before.\nPreachers and teachers and writers and communicators of the gospel find themselves in this cultural moment. But all of us as people of faith do too, in a very real sense, for we all have a platform nowadays. And into this fact-checking mentality and culture we bring Scripture, which is filled with strange stories of people being made from dust and ribs, and axe heads that float on the surface of the water. Then there’s that virgin birth that eventually led to a man who claimed to be God but then died but then decided we were all better off with Him alive, so He un-died and is still around today. \nIn the minds of some, Christians are the original fake-newsers. Who in their fact-checking mind would believe our message? And what are we supposed to do about it?  To borrow a line from some actual news of late: Nevertheless, we must persist. But as we persist, we must be diligent to not fall into the spreading of what some call the larger category that includes fake news: bad news. \nThe good news is that if we’ll simply stop trying so hard to save ourselves, we’ll find that there is One who has already taken care of all that and then some. His name is Jesus, and His ears are poised and ready to respond to all who would call on Him—Jew or Greek, free or slave, American or Arabic, doctor or school bus driver, grandparent or hipster.\n“For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Romans 10:13).\nWhen we fact-check that verse, we find that the phrase “everyone who calls” means, well, everyone who calls. And we find that “the name of the Lord” is Jesus, that virgin-born man who claimed to be God. And that last phrase—“will be saved”—is a fact you just have to take on faith.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

How can a good God be wrathful toward people?\nThis passage in Romans 9, among many others, raises tough questions about God’s character. Good questions. Questions that God doesn’t mind you asking and that He can handle.\nHow can a good God be wrathful toward sin? He can because He is a good judge, and good judges rightfully hate and push back against evil. We want a God who says, “I am here to not allow injustice to reign as king. I am here to reign as King against injustice.” \nBecause God is perfect, His wrath isn’t like ours—it’s an outflow of His perfect love and goodness. And because of this great love, God calls us to place our faith in His righteousness and not our own.\nWe’re clay, created by God to worship Him. When we try to earn our salvation, we miss the point of our existence. This was Israel’s greatest mistake.\nIf you read through the Old Testament, you see Israel obeying and then disobeying God, worshiping Him and then worshiping idols, ultimately placing their hope in something other than God’s unmerited favor. Israel tried and tried to work for their salvation, and they even questioned God for not rewarding their efforts. But God’s not interested in our white-knuckled efforts. He’s interested in our faith driving us to love Him and others.\nGod is not surprised by sin, but that doesn’t mean He’s ambivalent toward it. God is not surprised by unbelief, but that doesn’t mean He’s satisfied with our misplaced worship. In fact, He cares so much that He sent His Son to live the life we couldn’t live and die the death we deserve.\nMay we not be bitter or angry toward God like the Israelites, questioning His character because we don’t like something He’s said or done. Instead, let us lay our lives down for Him because of His righteous, perfect character. He is good and He does good.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

The ruling will come down and you will be condemned—there’s no way around it. \nThe judge looks at the evidence and listens to the testimony of witnesses. But then, in a dramatic turn of events, he picks up the gavel and, striking the bench like a hammer driving a nail, renders the verdict: “not guilty.” \nYou and everyone else know you are guilty of the accusations brought against you. But the judge has shown you mercy.\nThe reality is that every person saved by Jesus has been shown mercy like this. “Guilty” is the only verdict any of us deserve, and apart from Christ, it is the ruling rendered upon all men and women on this earth. All our wrongdoing and wrong-loving has stood trial, and the evidence against us is insurmountable.\nThough we do not deserve to be let off the hook, God is the only judge who can and does show mercy to anyone He desires. Some might say that pronouncing a verdict of “not guilty” upon someone who is clearly guilty is unfair, and they are correct. The unfairness of this forgiveness God grants through His mercy is called grace. Grace cannot be earned, but is a gift given by God to an otherwise hopelessly guilty people.\nMercy and compassion are gifts God gives for His good pleasure, but they are not free. God does not just let us off the hook. A price must be paid for our sin. God, in His compassion and mercy, gave His only Son, Jesus, to pay the penalty for our violation of His law. \nGod will show mercy upon whom He will show mercy. But He does not set people free without penalty. That would be unjust. He pays the wage of our sin through the blood of His Son. This is our hope: the perfectly just mercy of God, given to those who do not deserve it, through the undeserved sufferings of Christ in our place. \nWhat a great mercy! What a great cost!\nWritten by Jevon Washington\n\n                ",

Most often when we answer this question, whether privately in our hearts or more boldly, we limit the love of God. We attach His love to the circumstances or results we want. We draw a straight line between God’s love and our comfort.\nRomans 8 paints an altogether different picture of a love so much bigger, richer, deeper, and more complete than anything we are even capable of imagining. It isn’t a contingent love or one designed to dole out creature comforts. It cannot be cheapened by our color-by-number effort to depict it. Romans 8 is a masterpiece of God’s love, which is intended for our good.\nIn Jesus we live loved. We breathe love and exist each moment ensconced in it. No one can condemn us. No one can judge us. No enemy can assail us. Yes, we will be condemned, judged, and assailed in this world, but no one can remove us from Christ’s love. Our own fears and insecurities, even our own death, cannot remove us from the love of God.\nThis profound love of God was ours before we were conscious of it, and will be ours for all eternity to the fullness of our joy and glorification. God promised to complete the good work He started in us (Philippians 1:6), and He will—through the transformative power of His love. \nWhen Romans 8:28 says “all things work together for good,” this is what it means: not that every painful or confusing moment will pay out in happiness, but that God’s love will not fail. We will reap its benefits throughout infinite time.\nIn this single passage we see the fullness of God—Father, Son, and Spirit—offer the fullness of His love to those who believe. The Spirit intercedes on our behalf when we lack the words or ability. The Son sacrifices Himself as the means—the access—to this rich love. The Father is the ordainer, author, and giver of the eternal plan of love. And we are part of it, in it for all time. \nWe may never get what we filled in the blank with above—that thing we attached to God’s love, that trite and limiting expected sign of His goodness. Instead we will be more than conquerors in eternal glory, no matter what we face in this temporal life.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

First, I’ve come to understand that time moves every bit as fast as others told me it would back when I was in my 20s; and, second, I can do just about every physical act I did in my 20—but I need more time to recover. \nThe strength and vigor that once marked my life is now replaced with pains and groans. This unwanted experience has served to better my appreciation for the Apostle Paul’s references to groaning in Romans 8:18-25. In that place, Paul sets the hope of glory against the backdrop of the groaning of this fallen world.\nWe live in a world that God has subjected to futility (Romans 8:20). Everything around us is groaning under the burden of the fall of man. The fall of Adam brought misery to the entire created order. The turmoil in the world is not simply limited to the turmoil between nations and peoples. There is an innate groaning among all creatures in the animal kingdom, too. There is even a groaning among the trees and vegetation. \nAll of creation is crying out for something better. \nThis is one reason why the prophet Isaiah speaks of the glories of the new heavens and new earth under the symbol of the lion laying down with a calf in peace (Isaiah 11:6). It’s why the psalmist speaks of the trees clapping their hands at the prospect of the Lord coming to judge the world in righteousness (Isaiah 55:12). In one very real sense, the entire creation is like a woman in labor. This old, broken creation is eagerly anticipating the new creation that Christ has secured and will deliver by His death and resurrection. \nThere is, however, also the groaning of the people of God who have been subjected to the sufferings of this present life. This groaning is tied to the persecution believers endure at the hands of unbelievers—both in the church and in the world. There is a tremendous burden in the sufferings believers must bear up under as they press on to the hope of glory. But there will come a day when believers will be set free, in body and soul, from the sufferings of this present age and will be ushered into the inexpressible glory of everlasting life.\nWhenever we hear or feel the groans of this life—whether in the created order around us or in our own hearts—we must remember that there will come a day of glory for creation in general and for believers in particular. All temporal groaning will end and eternal rejoicing will commence when Christ comes in glory to raise His people from the dust.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    October 31, 2017, marks the 500-year anniversary of the day Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of All Saints Church in Wittenberg, Germany. Luther’s burning conviction was to preach that salvation came to God’s people only by miraculous grace through faith in Jesus Christ. Now, there were other monks and priests at the time with similar convictions, but it seems clear that Luther’s intense study of Romans was his tipping point. In passion and in conviction, he penned and posted a document that would change the face of the Church in the West forever.\nLuther knew from Paul’s letter to the Romans that the Spirit of God alone could mark us as children of God. Good works, good intentions, and good gifts to the church or the poor weren’t without value, but they could never stand as being able to save anyone in and of themselves.\nThe very good news of Romans is the same very good news of the Gospels: God entered the world, a world that He had created perfectly and that we, through sin, had marred. God sent His Son to bring us life everlasting. This life, as Paul so clearly points out here in Romans 8, comes with and through the gift of the Spirit, Who produces spiritual fruit in our lives.\nJesus said to His disciples that we could be recognized by our fruits. There seems to be a very similar thread here in Romans 8. Life in the Spirit is marked by the fruits of the Spirit. Paul is not only giving a promise here, but also a quick spiritual litmus test for our own lives. When we, as believers, examine our hearts, actions, and decisions, do we see a pattern of Spirit-filled movement? Of course, we will still see sin. In fact, both Jesus and Paul acknowledge this. But it should be troublesome to us if we see a continuous pattern in our lives incongruent with the marks of the Spirit.\nThe good news is that if you choose to be led by the Spirit, you can have confidence in your place as a child of God. Paul proclaims: “If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you” (Romans 8:11). \nThere should be evidence of the Holy Spirit’s work in the Christian’s life. But as Martin Luther contended, that spiritual fruit does not come through our work. In today’s passage, Paul encourages us that we have the power of God—the same power that raised Jesus from the dead—living in us to help us produce that spiritual fruit. \nWhen you’ve placed all of the good, the bad, and the ugly in your life at the feet of Jesus, you have the Spirit of God as your advocate. He is the one Who testifies with our spirit that we are the children of God. \nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    My dad was a pastor, so I was pretty familiar with the Bible growing up. Check that. My dad was a Southern Baptist pastor in the 70s and 80s, so I grew up doing sword drills and memorizing Scripture as part of the air I breathed as a kid. But it seems now there was a lot of the Bible we touched on and a lot we skipped over.\nLike Romans, for instance. I knew a lot of this book. I knew the “Roman Road to heaven” in high school. But there was a lot in this book I did not discover until college.\nTake Romans 7, for example. I can remember the first time I got ahold of Paul’s own wrestling. I can remember the “aha!” moment pretty well, actually. I remember it so well because of how it made me feel less alone in my struggle with sin. Whether it was in my own head or because I heard someone say it, I walked away with the thought, “so this is the Christian life.”\nThat was a pretty revolutionary moment. Up until then I’d bought into the idea that if I was a real Christian, I would not struggle with sin as Paul describes. I would always be saying no to sin and yes to righteousness. What felt like a cosmic battle between good and evil within my own heart, which often made me feel sick to my stomach, was surely a sign of how carnal I was.\nBut this was Paul. Paul was the man. And it was clear he struggled too.\nThat was a beginning a for me. I felt less alone and more free to talk about my struggles instead of pretend to have it all together. It was a slow process, but it was sure. As one who wanted to follow Jesus and be holy, I was glad to know that struggling was a sign of fighting. And fighting was a sign of following Jesus.\nI think we assume sin will kind of fade away from us as we grow in the faith. And that is true to a point. As Paul taught in chapter 6, we have been set free from sin (6:18). But there will be seasons when we struggle in big ways. And as we grow older and wiser, we will see our sinfulness and our need for His grace more clearly. So really, what Paul reveals to us is good news: We will struggle. But that means we are fighting. And fighting is a dead giveaway that we are believing the gospel and following Christ.\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Death takes more than it brings. It takes not just people, but relationships and dreams and future plans. Death is more of an intruder than an invited guest. It brings tears and a church gathering where awkward small talk with strangers is accompanied by deviled eggs and cucumber sandwiches.\nPersonally, I hate death. I hate the emotions it brings and the loss it forces me into. I hate that it even exists. I will admit that my hatred for death is a selfish hatred. To be forced to lose my people, my relationships, and my future dreams hurts.\nDeath, at its core, reminds me that I am not in control. This life is not about my plans. Death is a deep reminder that something is seriously wrong. It pushes us to admit that this world, in its present state, is not where we belong.\nSo if we don’t belong here, then where do we belong? Where is the place we can settle into without the dread of eviction? This question is ultimately not about a place, but a person: to whom do we belong? \nFor the Christian, we belong to Him who was raised from the dead. We belong to the One who is victorious over death. We belong to Christ.\nOur Scripture today reminds us that we belong to Him who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God in this life (Romans 7:4). Our lives here matter. We are called to bear fruit, to invest in those parts of life that last beyond the grave. This is comforting.\nThough we will all die in some sort of physical way (unless the Lord returns first), we should not dread death as though it ends everything. As the Lord assures us in Proverbs 1:33, “whoever listens to me will live securely and be undisturbed by the dread of danger.”\nDeath comes and we are shocked and grieved. We hurt with those who feel the loss. Some of the fruit we grow in this life because of Christ is the peace dwelling secure, without dread, because we know life is ultimately victorious over death. \nIn Christ, we have a security that keeps us beyond any death.  \nWritten by Jason Tippetts\n\n                ",

We don’t RSVP to the party too early lest something better comes along. And we do all this in order to remain free.\nOr, so we think.\nSadly, this loose-ended, unattached freedom proves to be its own slavery. For in refusing to commit to relationships, we’re ensnared by loneliness. In always remaining open to the better offer, we’re trapped by anxiety. And whenever a better offer doesn’t pan out the way we hoped (and that will happen time and again), we spiral into depression. Isn’t it true that sometimes our best attempts at freedom turn into the worst kinds of captivity?\nIt’s actually through serving that we find freedom, and we’re all serving someone or some thing. Bob Dylan understood this, as the lyrics from his 1979 hit, “Gotta Serve Somebody,” make clear: \nYou’re gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed\nYou’re gonna have to serve somebody,\nWell, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord\nBut you’re gonna have to serve somebody.\nDylan is absolutely right. You’re gonna serve something. But whether it’s the devil or the Lord – well, that will make all the difference.\nWe learn in today’s reading that the truly free life of the Christian is not so much a freedom from slavery as it is a freedom to be bound to Someone in the right kind of way. Which makes sense if you think about it, for that is exactly how true love works.\nWhen we love a friend or a spouse, we willingly restrict ourselves in service to them. We spend money on them. We carve out time to be with them. We give to them our attention and affection. We do this not because we have to, but because we want to—because we love them. Our love for them leads us into a voluntary, life-giving, joy-spreading life of service. It’s the same way with Jesus Christ, “…having been set free from sin, [we] become slaves of righteousness” (Romans 6:18) in love for Jesus Christ. \nThe more we see and experience what Jesus has done for us – paying the penalty, breaking the power, and one day removing entirely the presence of sin – the more we can then return His love with love that willingly renders us “slaves of God” (Romans 6:22).\nBrothers, take in the love of Christ for you today. Let His love free you to such a degree that you willingly and joyfully enslave yourself to God and His righteousness all the days of your life.\nWritten by Nate Shurden\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    After a grocery store run with my children—not forgetting a thing, item or child—I felt proud of myself when we pulled back onto our driveway.  \nAs we were getting out of my truck, I heard my daughter stomp on the concrete. Then more stomping. Then stomping with a dash of panic. She ran away, spooked and screaming, “Kill it, Papa! Kill it!” I gently put the eggs down, and ran over to see a mutant, Hot-Wheel-sized, furry, wingless wasp-looking thing. I stomped. It moved. I stomped two more times. The beast ran. Three more stomps. It darted and tried to lose me in the grass, but after a barrage of stomps and some heel-digs, it was all over. I killed what my friends on Facebook identified as a “velvet ant.”  \nVelvet ants are infamous for their bites and their toughness. Sin is, too, isn’t it? But Jesus is stronger. The temptations we face are real, no doubt. But our death to sin and new life in Christ are even more real because that life will last for 10 billion years—and more—to come.\nWe all have various sins that easily trap us (Hebrews 12:1). But Jesus introduces us to new life, new power, and a new way with Him on the throne. Sin’s grasp on us was formidable, but when Jesus died on the cross He crushed the velvet ant-ness of our sin. Christ conquered and killed what every other power could not. He rose from the dead, bringing us along with Him toward a life of grace, forgiveness, and freedom from sin (Galatians 5:1).\nOur freedom from sin’s chains is as real as Christ’s cross and His empty tomb. A no-longer-dead Jesus means a no-longer-doomed-to-sin you and me. Let’s not throw our hands up in despair, overhyping sin’s power and disbelieving Christ’s declaration of victory over it. Let’s receive it. Let’s accept the freedom Christ gives to those who believe.\nDon’t buy the propaganda that sin has power over you. Look past it. Look back to a blood-stained hill outside of Jerusalem. See, by faith, a stack of used grave clothes from your risen Friend. Look beyond what tempts you. Look to the One who saves you. \nIf you are in Christ, an obituary for your life in sin has been already published, and good news is printed on top: “Dead to sin. Alive in Christ.”\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Unless you’ve been living under a rock lately, you’ve heard the phrase “love wins.” It has become a rallying cry for a collection of voices, an umbrella-like conviction wide enough for many to stand under. But while inspiring, the phrase begs for clarification because there are a number of different kinds of love in this world. \nC. S. Lewis highlighted four loves. Someone else might insist there are more or less, but the point is there is more than one kind of love. The sacrificial love a spouse practices on a daily basis may indeed reflect the kind of love that wins in the end, while the “I sure do love my Ford F-150” kind of love may not. So it’s not so much a wrong phrase as a vague phrase. Something more specific would serve we the people better.\nAnd here’s something. In today’s passage, the Apostle Paul gives us an alternative for “love wins” that covers the necessary bases. In other words, it is just as powerful while at the same time rings even more clear. Paul’s phrase? Grace wins.\n“Wait, isn’t there more than one kind of grace in the world as well?”\nYes, good catch, as there most certainly is. There is the grace the old hymn writer called “amazing” and there is also the grace said before supper. But leave it to old Paul and that thing called “context” to provide our needed clarity. When Paul uses the word “grace,” he is talking about, as one translator renders it, “aggressive forgiveness.”\nNow chew on that for a second or two. Grace is God’s aggressive forgiveness. And if we fancy ourselves as people of grace, which we like to believe we are, then aggressive forgiveness will be a defining characteristic of our lives as well. But far too often we practice something along the lines of dragging-our-heels forgiveness, which is why far too often we are not winning.\nSo grab your used copy of C. S. Lewis and drive around in your F-150 and love everything and everybody, okay? But remember—“for just as through one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous.” \nWhen all is said and done—when there’s a loser and a winner—grace wins.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Before marrying my wife, I was in a “serious” relationship with a woman I thought I’d marry. I was saving up for a ring, we were talking about our future kids, and we even began looking at neighborhoods we’d like to live in.\nIf I’m honest, I put my entire hope in her. I would not have said so at the time, but she was my god. I offered sacrifices at her altar daily, and I based my entire life around her wants, needs, schedule, and interests.\nI didn’t realize how bad it was until she broke it off. I was devastated. I’ve probably never cried more in my life than I did during that season. My god let me down—and I felt empty.\nPaul’s words here in Romans 5 were the words I needed that that time. He tells the church in Rome:\nTherefore, since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ… This hope will not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.\n– Romans 5:1,5\nI didn’t listen to those words at first, but I learned their truth in the midst of my suffering. Placing my hope in another person was futile. She was a sinner just as much as me, and she could never bear the weight of my worship.\nPeople aren’t built to be gods. Neither are jobs or hobbies or riches or even our best attempts at good works. None of these can fully satisfy. They’re all created things. Only the Creator deserves and can handle our worship and dependence.\nIf we confess Jesus as Lord, we become adopted into God’s family. “And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!” (Galatians 4:6). Our Father loves us and wants us to place our hope in him.\nLay your hope—your entire life!—at his feet. He can handle it.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

Someone hires a contractor to build their home, and somewhere in the process the builder stops working, stops showing up, and abandons the project. The hopeful homeowner is stuck with a half-finished house, which is about as useful as no house at all. The frustration is great because the homeowner hired the builder to make something very important, and the builder promised to do the work to the end. The break in trust is painful.\nWe’re all looking for someone or something to trust in. But we live in a day where words alone don’t seem to carry much weight. Like papers blown away by a gust of wind through an open window, so go the promises people and possessions make, assuring us that we can trust in them for what our souls desperately yearn for most. \nThe truth is, only God can satisfy us. \nNo labor of our hands nor ascent of our intellects can make the promises of God come to pass. Only God can do that, and we have to trust Him. \nFaith is a gracious gift God gives to His children so that we might see His beauty and character. Just as a person might have surgery on his eyes enabling him to see light and color, so the Spirit of God gives us eyes of faith. When life gets hard, God can seem so far away. But when our trust is fastened to the reality of Jesus taking our sin and giving us His righteousness, we can rest in this busy and noisy world knowing we don’t have to go find Him. He has come to us through His son, Jesus. \nGod is not a flakey construction worker who stops in the middle of conforming us to Christ’s image. He always does what He says He will do. He will finish what He began. \nBecause our faith is a gift from God, anchored in the work of God, we can be certain of His faithfulness to us. “He was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification” (Romans 4:25), and nothing can take that away.\nWritten by Jevon Washington\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    What is it that makes a Christian right with God, innocent in His eyes? Can we gain it by being good enough and keeping God’s law? Most of us would pretty quickly answer no, we can’t. We must live by grace. We might even add that living by the law is legalism—trying to make ourselves right through actions and self-will. And we would be right to say this. Mostly.\nWhat sets the Christian faith apart from every other religion in the world is that we are not justified by works—that is: we are not made right and upstanding in the eyes of God because of what we do. We recognize that our works can’t accomplish this. We are justified by faith in Jesus’ perfect life, innocent death, and death-conquering resurrection. He is our atoning sacrifice—the sacrifice that takes on the punishment for another.\nBut so often we love to oversimplify and create “either / or” propositions out of rich and complex aspects of faith. We say we are saved by grace, not law, and while it is true that Christ’s sacrifice is the most profound act of grace in history, it happened because of the law.\nWe needed an atoning sacrifice to fulfill God’s law. The two are inextricably connected—God’s Law and Christ’s sacrifice. Sin could not go unpunished, and innocence cannot be handed out like candy at Halloween. God’s perfect justice led to God’s perfect mercy. So yes, we live by faith in the work of Jesus, and in so doing we are evidence that the law’s requirement was met in Christ.\nAnd our faith shows something more: we are now citizens of a new kingdom. We’ve been rescued from darkness and transferred to a “kingdom of light.” And what does it mean to be part of a kingdom but to be under the law of the land? We are under the new law that was ushered in through Christ’s perfect atonement—a law of grace.\nWe are governed by grace, shaped by grace, driven by grace. We obey God’s commands by grace and remember Christ’s work by grace. We cling to grace by faith, and so it is that we are saved by grace through faith, and that faith upholds God’s law. This is what makes us innocent in the eyes of God.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When I was 18 years old, I was accused of a crime that I didn’t commit. In the course of affairs, I had to take a lie detector test—which I apparently failed. I was devastated. I felt guilty, even though I wasn’t. It was one of the worst experiences of my youth.  \nThe great irony is that I was guilty of many worse things than that for which I was falsely accused and subsequently penalized. I have revisited that experience from time to time when I consider all that the Scriptures have to say about our sinfulness before God. God’s Word is universal in the scope of its testimony about the sinfulness of humanity when it says, “There is no one righteous, not even one” (Romans 3:10).\nThe Apostle Paul went to great lengths in Romans 1 to set out the catalog of sins that mark the Gentile world, which includes our own. Whether it is the sexual sin and idolatry that is widespread among the nations (1:18-27), or the more general sins that mark the day-in and day-out lives of unbelievers (1:28-32), there is manifold evidence of the absolute pervasiveness of the depravity of all humankind.\nOf course, when we hear such an indictment, there will always those who will say, “I’m not like that. I don’t do those sorts of things. I’m not that bad.” The Apostle anticipated such objections from those he knew so well—his own countrymen! When he brings the entire Jewish nation before the divine tribunal in chapter 2, he explains that when they condemn others for sin, they must remember that they, too, are guilty of functionally practicing the same things (2:21-24).\nIn chapter 3, the Apostle goes on to set the entire world before the all-searching eye of God, thus leveling the the playing field. Paul explains that God gave the Law so that “every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God” (3:19). Weaving together a number of statements from the Psalms (Psalms 14:1-3; 5:9; 140:3; 10:7; 36:1), Paul explains that every part of man has been affected by sin. References to the throats, tongues, lips, mouths, feet, and eyes of men are illustrative of the fact that every part of man has been corrupted. “There is no one who seeks God” (Romans 3:11).\nComing to terms with the extent of our guilt before God is part of coming to see our need for Christ. Apart from the grace of God in Christ, we are spiritually hopeless, helpless, and powerless. \nThanks be to God that He seeks and saves sinners.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

It was a Saturday night staple in our household. Good guys and bad guys, gunslingers and cattle ranchers, A Fistful of Dollars and A Few Dollars More.\nThese revered moments gave real-life weight to the words of men like Clint Eastwood, Robert Duvall, and the Duke himself, John Wayne. Wayne’s call for a code is one I’ve always respected. Of course many different moral systems could be nested under the umbrella of Wayne’s famous saying. For some it’s the golden rule, and for others it’s a fiery pursuit of justice. For still others it’s the commitment to live the way their folks raised ‘em.\nCreeds and codes are good. But they meet their greatest contest when the proclaimer of the code fails to keep it. Whether by deliberate choice or in the face of overwhelming opposition, codes eventually break down. What we do then says more about us than any ethic ever could.\nPaul was confronting this gut-wrenching sort of breakdown in his letter to the Romans. For his Jewish readers, and for the God-fearing Gentiles among them, the Old Testament law was their code. It was, in it’s purest form, a gift from God. But over-legislation by the religious leaders of the day made the law a crushing and impossible burden to bear.\nPaul knew from personal experience that even a deeply focused life dedicated to keeping the code would fall short. This murderer-turned-apostle had seen firsthand the mangled and marred disasters that could be found in the wake of law-based living.\nHis question, “Do you dishonor God by breaking the law?” begs a response; and his original readers would have intuited that. He is asking us to admit our hypocrisy. Why? So we can truly live. Rather than living as creatures of the code, Paul is calling us to be people living under lavish grace.\nIf we feel compelled to boast, let us boast in our weakness and in God’s unmerited grace and mercy. Codes, laws, rules—these things are fundamentally helpful, but our hearts are flawed. This is why God entered our litigious and punitive world: to reset the whole broken order. Certainly, we are encouraged to live lives of virtue. I think this is where the Duke got it right. But what sets us apart as New Testament believers is our ability to hand over our shortcomings, and to lay our failures at the feet of a gracious God.\nBoast not in your virtue, boast not in your vice, but rather each day offer thanks to God that He covers it all. We fail, each of us, in keeping the code. But we have a Great High Priest who stands over it all. In Him, we can seek virtue, be released from the condemnation of the Law, and find a freedom and grace in Jesus that far surpasses it all.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

The other day I saw it happen. A kid was shooting baskets. The first shot was bad, and he got mad instead of shooting again. Maybe you know a child who loses it when he drops something, or who sits down with math homework and is beside herself with frustration in 30 seconds or less. Kids’ sensitivities run deep. One day this may serve them well, but in the moment it can be maddening.\nMy kids struggle with this, but they come by it naturally. When I am tired after a long day at work, I tend to do the same thing. The slightest thing can cause me to spiral into being quite a grumpy dad. Spilled coffee grounds. Not being able to watch a baseball game. Running out of bacon.\nWhen I get frustrated with my kids’ behavior, it is a condemnation of my own behavior.\nI thought about this when reading Romans 2. Paul is trying to get religious people, or at least people prone to judging other’s behavior, to see that when you are critical of others, you set yourself up for condemnation. Whether you do this with laws everyone agrees on or the Law of God, you are really pronouncing a guilty sentence on yourself. Why? Because we’re guilty of doing the things we condemn others for.\nBut Paul doesn’t merely want his readers to feel guilty; he wants them own it, to know it. He wants them to buy into the idea that we all suffer from the same human condition. We are all guilty before God. We all deserve His judgment. The problem is, this is so hard to get people to see. So Paul uses their own moral compass against them. Paul’s goal, of course, is not just to make sure we know our own guilt. He wants us to trace the line from guilt, to need, and then on to the good news of what God has done in Christ.\nWhen I see bad behavior in one of my kids, I acknowledge that behavior is wrong and I tell them they need to stop. But because I do the same, I am also judging myself and revealing my own need. I need to experience the mercy and grace of the cross afresh, just as Paul’s original audience may have needed to experience it for the first time.\nWe must acknowledge our incessant need for Jesus. And when I do this—when you do this—we can know God’s kindness that leads us to repentance (Romans 2:4).\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

This isn’t the sort of thing most folks want to talk about at your local coffee shop or over dinner and drinks. Paul directly confronts sin and brings us face to face with God’s righteous wrath. Indeed, God’s wrath, says Paul, is revealed against all ungodliness.\nThe judgment described is frightening. Perhaps the most frightening phrase is this: “God gave them up” (Romans 1:24). When our hearts are blind, false, desirous of carnality and evil, He gives us what we desire. To get what we want in this life is sometimes—dare I say most of the time?—not blessing, but judgment.\nIn his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” So also, unrighteousness anywhere is a threat to righteousness everywhere. The minute we begin condoning evil, justifying our selfishness, and excusing our pet sins, instead of repenting of them, we are asking for judgment: for blindness, darkness, waywardness, folly, debased minds, and perverse passions. \nIt is a slippery slope, and there aren’t any pit stops along the way. There is no “sort-of” righteous, no “halfway” committed. There is no neutrality. There is wisdom or folly, life or death. “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and discipline” (Proverbs 1:7).\nHowever, this talk of judgment isn’t a load of pessimism. God’s righteous wrath is the only good response to a world of sin, and even to our own rebellious hearts. It flows from the simple fact that God is good and holy. \nGod’s holy wrath was visited upon Christ on the cross. His righteousness triumphs; yet in the midst of His wrath, He remembers mercy. Because of this, it is possible to both tremble and to trust.\nI am comforted by Paul’s words in 2 Timothy 3:9: “But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all.” Folly can’t be hidden. Ungodliness and unrighteousness will be revealed for what they are. This is both sobering and glorious news. I am provoked to repentance for my own folly and unrighteousness, and also to thanksgiving for God’s faithfulness and grace. \nMay Christ Himself keep us and guard us from our own folly—from the love of self and the love of the world, from presumption and from pride. May He keep us in His grace, that we may fear Him all the days of our lives. Thanks be to God, and to Him alone be the glory!\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Welcome to Paul’s letter to the Romans. \nMartin Luther said of this epistle, “It is well worth a Christian’s while not only to memorize it word for word but also to occupy himself with it daily, as though it were the daily bread of the soul.” Why did Luther hold Romans in such high esteem? Because, he said, “this letter is truly the most important piece in the New Testament. It is purest Gospel.”\nWhat makes Romans so special? While all Scripture is God-breathed and equally valuable, Romans is unique in that it is the most comprehensive, well-organized expression of Christian doctrine assembled in one place in the Bible.\nLuther wasn’t the only person who regarded this letter in this way. Paul did too. We see this in today’s reading when Paul actually gives us his thesis for the entire book:\n“For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.”\n– Romans 1:16-17 CSB\nThe reason Paul is so eager to preach Christ is that he believes the gospel has the power to give life where there is none. Jesus alone is the way to salvation. The message of Christ is free to all and powerful enough to save those who believe. \nPaul wrote this letter to explain to Jewish and Gentile converts alike what it means to believe in and be redeemed by Jesus Christ. This book reaches back deep into the Old Testament. It walks us through the origin and problem of sin, the reality of guilt, the impossibility of saving ourselves, and the ultimate rescue we’re given in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\nRomans is meant to be thorough—a practical, theological guide for the follower of Jesus. This book calls believers to trust Christ as it unfolds what it means to live by faith. By faith we anticipate our eternal home. But by that same faith, we also learn how to live as followers of Christ in this world. Romans speaks to both.\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ, Paul says, is the righteousness of God—meaning it is the way by which we are able to stand in the presence of God and live. In the work of Jesus, we see the character of God on display. In this letter we find a God of compassion, patience, and justice. We see unfathomable love displayed to complicated and broken people—a generosity of grace and mercy.\nWhether you are new to what it means to follow Christ, or you have read this letter many times over, read the book of Romans as though it is telling a single story—the story of how God rescues us through the sacrifice of Christ.\n Written by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    My wife and I often joke that aside from our commitment to God and love for one another, a third reason we will never get divorced is because we don’t want to enter the dating scene ever again. Dating is just the worst, isn’t it? The uncertainty. The awkwardness. The mystery sounds fun, but ultimately it’s stressful and sometimes overwhelming.\nThe Bible teaches that God protects and seals those He saves (John 10; Ephesians 1). This means God isn’t like your high school ex-girlfriend, who you could never quite figure out—that girl who threatened to break up with you every time you got into a little tiff, and then played you against other guys to make you jealous and manipulate your behavior. If God has set His love on you, literally nothing can separate you from Him (Romans 8:31-38).\nOur passage today doesn’t contradict that truth. Rather, Paul is telling the Corinthians their salvation is so secure that they can judge for themselves if it’s real. It’s not a mystery or a fleeting thing. Those who love Christ are transformed and made more like Him by the power of the Holy Spirit (Romans 12:1–2; 2 Corinthians 3:18; Galatians 5:22-23). \nIf we are becoming more like Christ, even if slowly and painfully, we can have confidence that the Spirit is at work in us. If we fail miserably, we know that God’s grace is not dependent upon our works, but on Christ crucified. The great mystery of salvation is that we are sinful, yet forgiven; we are imperfect, yet growing more and more into Christ’s perfect image through the work of the Holy Spirit.\nPaul encourages the Corinthian believers to test their faith, to see to it that they keep becoming more mature. We are all weak, but God’s power works through us. He will never let us go. This truth helps us to both press into His love and push away sin. And it’s only by the power of the Holy Spirit that we can do either one.\nMay we rejoice in the work of Christ, both in our own hearts and in the world. And may we continue to mature and grow in our faith, doing what is right in His eyes and for the truth of His gospel (2 Corinthians 13:11,8). \nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When was the last time you played the “one up” game? You know, the game you play when you’re with other men and you start to tell stories. One guy starts sharing his story of conquest and achievement, and before you know it, the next guy puffs out his chest and tells a story that’s just a bit bigger than his friend’s. The boasting and bragging inflate with each subsequent story told. If there is an “alpha male” in the group, you can be confident he will bring out the biggest fish of all, thus ending the game with his dramatic achievement.\nPaul’s “boastings” here in this passage make you wonder if he is playing that game as well. Pitted against the “super-apostles,” Paul has had to defend his credentials and ministry before the very church that he planted in that city. As the church was seduced away from sound doctrine and living by flashy and false celebrity teachers, Paul sought to correct and restore them to the truth. But that came at a cost. The Corinthians had bought the lie that the super-apostle with the greatest boasts was clearly the one worth following, regardless of what he taught. If Paul wanted to bring the church under his leadership again, he knew he’d have to play the game to engage the Corinthians. \nHowever, unlike the boasting that Paul’s opponents give, Paul flips the script and lays out his weaknesses. Instead of puffing out his chest and talking about how many souls he’s converted, or churches he’s planted, or multitudes he’s spoken to, he lays out his thorns. He “takes pleasure in weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions” (2 Corinthians 12:10). But why?\nBecause faithfully following Jesus looks more like a cross than a crown. The power of the gospel is more profoundly displayed in human weakness and suffering than it is in demonstrated power and triumph. The reason for this is so God’s strength will be seen, even in our weakness. It’s so we can’t take any glory for what belongs solely to Him.\nPerhaps you’re tempted to boast in your spiritual victories and achievements. Here, at almost the end of this 1 and 2 Corinthians reading plan, you may feel a bit of pride that you’ve read every day and been in prayer. You may want God to notice and affirm your strength of will and dedication to Him. \nThe good news is that God’s not looking to affirm “one-up men.” His eye is to the weak and the humble. Why? So He gets all the glory for His grace. May we learn this “secret of being content” Paul spoke of, “whether in abundance or in need”—that in Christ Jesus we are able to do all He’s called us to do (Philippians 4:12-13). He alone is the source of our strength. He alone is worthy of our praise. Let us boast in Him.\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n \n\n                ",

If you use it in a sentence with your pals, you are likely to make someone uncomfortable. It isn’t a notion we like to ponder, because it runs so counter to our natural way of thinking. In an age that is indifferent to truth, the virtues of righteousness, purity, faithfulness, and holiness cause folks to squirm. It’s much easier to accept the call to holiness as a private pursuit or, to really water things down, a personal preference. Why? Because being set apart as the pure bride for Christ means we must lay aside our own selves. We must die to self. \nWhen Paul confronts the Corinthians, he is loathe to talk about himself and his own credentials. Yet it is a “foolishness” that serves to reveal the true nature of the gospel. He tells them, “If boasting is necessary, I will boast about my weaknesses” (2 Corinthians 11:30).\nThe world always sees the wisdom of God as foolishness, and the strength of God as weakness. Yet when Christ washed His disciples’ feet, this was true success. Christ’s silence before His accusers was a victory. When He remained on the cross as the crowd jeered, “He saved others, but he cannot save himself!” (Matthew 27:42), this was a triumph. Christ did not come into the world so that we could be like the world, but that we might be set apart from it and made to be more like Him. \nBut the lure of falsehood is strong, both for the Corinthians and for us. It often enters into our lives, not through an active rebellion, but through complacency, through a passive concession to lies. Like Eve, we are prone to give the serpent the benefit of the doubt. We like to have our ears tickled. We hear him out, consider his boastful appeal, making sure not to offend. Like Adam, we stand by idly, instead of confronting the dragon (Genesis 3). We exchange humility for tolerance, and courage for captivity.\nWe live in a world full of boasting and false teachers who proclaim false gospels—of prosperity, of self-worship, of self-righteousness, of permissiveness—but who fail to proclaim the Christ who came to make His bride holy. \nGiven that we are so much like the Corinthians, I am provoked to examine myself. “For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any double-edged sword, penetrating as far as the separation of soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart” (Hebrews 4:12). \nIs my own heart devoted to Christ? Or do I make concessions to the world in my mind, my heart, my life? Do I sit idle while the serpent of old tickles my ears and strokes my pride? I have plenty of my own boasting and foolishness that I must yield to Christ. But I greatly rejoice at this opportunity, for He has purchased me by His blood and is preparing me for Himself. In Him alone is my joy complete.\nWe rejoice, therefore, in the service of Christ. We boast in our weakness, and we preach but one gospel: Christ, and Him crucified.\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

It’s easy to do, and Lord knows, I’ve been there. In a culture that so highly values and esteems credentials and qualifications, it’s easy to slip into a conversational pattern of only sharing your most recent wins. \nDon’t get me wrong, it’s good to celebrate our joys and successes with our friends, family, and community. But if we’re not careful, we can slowly digress into the realm of one-upmanship and humble brags. Maybe it’s not so overt for you, but rather an, “Aw-shucks, here’s my latest, awesome thing.” Or perhaps on social media you’re just harmlessly sharing your best, #blessed life. \nWhile a lot has changed for humanity and the body of Christ since Paul’s day, it seems like basic human inclinations have not. Paul’s reminder to “boast in the Lord” alone was as much a reminder to himself as it was to his audience (2 Corinthians 10:17). It seems like he would’ve been the first to admit this. \nI imagine for each of us, there are different areas of our lives or different social circles that prompt us toward more of a “look at me” posture. So apart from avoiding people and social media altogether, I think there are some practical steps we can take.\nThe first antidote to boasting is living with a focused memory. The Israelites lost their way when they forgot the history of God’s mighty deeds and His steadfast love. We are prone to do the same, focusing on our own strengths because we’ve forgotten the blessings of God that have led us to where we are today. \nAnother antidote to boasting is curiosity. In developing a healthy sense of curiosity, we begin asking more questions of others and seek to learn more of their expertise. Some of the most humble and influential men and women I’ve ever met are phenomenally curious question-askers. \nMy prayer for us today is that we’d hone our sense of memory, and deepen our sense of wonder and curiosity. These practices will help us boast more frequently in the Lord and His mighty works, acknowledging His rightful place of power and authority over our lives. They will also help us celebrate the victories of those around us. Surprisingly, I think we’ll find ourselves feeling more whole, purposeful, and confident in our calling and identity as a member of the body of Christ. \nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Generosity is a trait we love—in others, that is. Most of us love the idea of giving. When we do give, we don’t regret it, because it feels good to give. Sort of. Maybe. Sometimes we miss the money or time we gave and would like to have it back, or at least get something back in return. It’s easy to regret the cost of giving, but that’s not the attitude of a cheerful giver; it’s the attitude of an investor. We want dividends paid in exchange for our “gift,” or rather, our “investment.”\nToday’s reading in 2 Corinthians 9 turns our attitude of investment generosity on its head. The picture it paints is that of a farmer sowing seed. In the spring he sows seed, and in the fall he harvests. How much he harvests and the quality of his harvest depends on how much he sows and the quality of his seed. If he scatters a few crummy seeds he will harvest a lean crop, but if he sows generously he will reap generously. \nAt first, this appears to be a similar metaphor to that of investing: you get out what you put in, plus a little extra. But Paul isn’t finished yet. Consider the farmer’s dependence on God. He puts little dead plant pods in dirt and prays God will transform it into growing, living sustenance. He hopes his seeds will bear fruit, but it isn’t up to him. \nNext, notice how Paul describes what is reaped: “And God is able to make every grace overflow to you, so that in every way, always having everything you need, you may excel in every good work” (2 Corinthians 9:8). \nPaul is not describing riches gained on a return investment. The harvest of generous sowing is due to “every grace,” so we can “excel in every good work.” Faithful, hopeful generosity results in abundant grace and growth in our lives, not necessarily our bank accounts. While these graces that help us do good work might include money or material gain, that is neither a guarantee nor the point. Our investment is in every good work, and that is our dividend. \nPaul goes on to emphasize thanks, not reward. The fruit of generosity is thankfulness and “shouts of joy” (Psalm 126:5). That response reflects a kind of generosity I rarely see or participate in, but wouldn’t that be amazing? It would mean giving as we have received from God—lavishly, sacrificially, whole-heartedly, lovingly, and without ceasing. This kind of sowing reaps thanksgiving and praise. It is a pouring out of life, not just dollars. And the harvest is rich, beautiful, and bountiful.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n\n                ",

Starting a new work is filled with challenges, struggles, and things to work through-—enough so that there are many books and conferences on the subject.\nBut the challenges most church planters in the West face today are nothing compared to what Paul had to navigate. Today’s reading in 2 Corinthians 8 focuses on a collection Paul was taking to assist believers who were suffering for their faith. Christian churches in those days were born through suffering and affliction. It was hard to be a Christian in public. Sometimes it could cost you your life. And yet, Paul says, though they suffered, the believers in Macedonia (Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea) remained generous with their giving to the needs of others, though they had little to give. \nPaul had been taking up a collection for believers in Jerusalem who were suffering persecution and famine. In this chapter, Paul is asking one group of believers who are suffering for their faith to contribute to the needs of another group of believers who are suffering for their faith.\nThis is about more than money. Paul is appealing to the Corinthians believers, and to us, to not cling too tightly to the things of this world. His argument is essentially this: “Think of what you’ve been given in Christ. Think of what His generosity gave others and cost Him. Walk in this way.” When it comes to money, let the generosity of Christ loosen your grip on material wealth, and let your boast be in how much you’ve been given in Christ, not in how much you’ve given away to others, or in how much you’ve built up for yourself.\nThis applies to so many other areas of life too, doesn’t it? Church planting. Reputation. Esteem in the eyes of the world. Relationships. How we go about our work. Generosity. Service to others. For the believer, because of what Christ has given us, we should live generous lives, seeking the good of others, even when we have needs of our own.\nThe irony here is that the biblical principle of generosity can seem limiting when, in reality, it’s freeing. We become great by becoming the servant of all. May the Lord give us generous hearts and open hands when it comes to our labors together in Christ.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

As my cousin and I crept out of the grocery store that day, cards falling out of our pant legs, it didn’t take long for my Aunt Rosie to bust us. She marched us back into the store and made us apologize to the manager. Sure, we escaped a prison sentence as kids, but I was shook. Tears were flowing. I’m-so-sorrys were everywhere. I hated that I got caught.\nA few months after my crime of passion, I heard about Jesus’ death and resurrection saving people from sin, Satan, hell, and the wrath of God. It all “clicked” for me. I’d stolen baseball cards and lied to my parents—I realized then that I’m a sinner and that I needed Jesus to save me. I believed He could. From that day forward, the way I saw and understood my sin and myself changed forever. \nThe grief over my sin led to repentance—a 180-degree change. I admitted my sin and wanted to honor God. Twenty-five years later, I’m still following the same paradigm. Godly grief, motivated by love for God, “produces repentance that leads to salvation” and real heart change. Worldly grief, motivated by love for self, “produces death,” and therefore, no change for good (1 Corinthians 7:10). Paul wants us to see difference.\nIt’s no surprise as Christians that we still sin. What should be surprising is the way we handle it when compared to those who haven’t been crucified and raised with Christ. When your sin gets pointed out to you, how do you react? Do you ask for forgiveness, repent, and change course? Or do you put concrete around your heart, refusing to admit the transgression, and try to avoid the subject?\nOnly the cross of Christ could deal with our sin, once and for all. The cross tells us all our sins have already been paid for, aired out before the universe; and because Christ is alive, I have the power to change with the help of the indwelling Holy Spirit. I’m now aware of my sin and I hate it, but because of Jesus, I can now walk in newness of life. \nBrothers, the kind of grief that simply causes us to hate that we got caught and were embarrassed—that’s the way of the world. But godly grief leads to repentance, transformation, and an eagerness to make things right with those we’ve sinned against. Thanks be to Jesus for making us new. “Because of the LORD’s faithful love we do not perish, for his mercies never end” (Lamentations 3:22).\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

I not only cannot fix my car in any meaningful way, I cannot even remember what has been done by my mechanic. Thankfully, there is a receipt box included in every car. You may call it a “glove box,” but I never wear gloves, and therefore, I’ve never placed a glove in that box. The only thing I can do with any confidence is change a tire and put gas in the car. And I use the word “confidence” loosely. Needless to say, I’ve never received a call from my mechanic that did not result in the significant depletion of my bank account. \n But I do know when my wheels are out of alignment. Inevitably, one day you get to a certain speed—usually on the interstate—and the front-end of your car starts to shake. (That’ll cost you about $60 with a Groupon, by the way.) The problem is that the wheels aren’t in sync; they are, in effect, not going the same way perfectly. This not only messes with the quality of travel down the road, but it eventually ruins your tires.\nIn 2 Corinthians 6, Paul is concerned about whom the believers in Corinth are aligning themselves with. He tells them, “Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?” (v. 14).\nYou see, Paul had planted the church in Corinth, but some teachers who opposed his teaching had infiltrated the church. Though no one is absolutely sure what they were teaching, we do know they opposed Paul, and so we can assume they opposed his teaching of salvation by grace through alone. They may have been like the Judaizers, who taught that Gentiles had to follow the Old Testament laws (including circumcision) in order to follow Jesus. Needless to say, Paul was concerned about their false teaching.\nThink about what a yoke does. It gets placed over the neck of two animals, so they will go in the same direction. Imagine the problem if you place a yoke over a cow and a donkey, or an ox and a horse. It wouldn’t work. You need two oxen. Or you need two donkeys, so they will go in the same direction. They need to be aligned.\nOften, this passage is quoted in reference to marriage. That’s surely implicit, but what is even more explicit is the need to understand that Christians need to align themselves with others who believe in the gospel of grace through faith alone when working towards kingdom purposes. The temptation will be for individual believers and churches to look at the world’s way of getting things done, and then try to hitch themselves to those ways. But this temptation must be resisted, no matter how enticing the power and the glory promised are. Paul makes it clear: the world’s ways are not kingdom ways. They have nothing to do with one another, and the payoff will be costly.\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

Do you wonder, If I am a saint, why can’t I live a victorious Christian life? If so, you are not alone. Consider these words from the apostle Paul and how often we, too, cry out to God in similar ways. “What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?” (Romans 7:23). \nThe Christian life is a journey of killing sin; we are either killing sin or sin is killing us. And the pursuit of righteousness often teaches us that the more we grow in holiness, the more sin we see in ourselves. In the pursuit of righteousness, this may alarm us, but it should not disarm us. In fact, the gospel of Jesus Christ reminds us that we are far worse than we once realized, but God is better than we ever could have imagined. \nThis is why the gospel is good news! “[God] made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:21). In other words, Jesus paid the price for our sin so that we could be counted as righteous before God. And the righteousness of Christ is credited to us when we trust in Him for salvation! \nTherefore, in the fight for righteousness, we should not be driven to despair or defeat when we consider the presence of sin in our lives. Instead, this should drive us to Christ, where we find grace and peace. Through faith, Jesus’ victory over sin and death becomes our victory over sin and death. \nAs Tim Keller has said, “The Christian gospel is that we are so flawed that Jesus had to die for us, yet we are so loved that Jesus was willing to die for us.” Did you catch that? We are so loved that Christ willingly died for us. It is in the security of His love, in response to His love, that we pursue righteousness. \nOne day, when Christ appears we will experience the fullness of salvation in eternal life without sin. Now, in this life, His grace has appeared bringing salvation, but also training us to renounce ungodliness. It is His grace that trains and equips us to live self-controlled and godly lives in this present age. \nTherefore, when the Spirit reveals sin in your life, it is an act of grace. In light of this grace, we must act in faith. Faith teaches us to trust that while our sin is great, Christ is greater. Faith repeatedly trains us to turn from sin and turn to Christ. You see, the victorious Christian life isn’t the sinless life; it’s the repentant life of faith. In this sense, a saint is one who falls and gets back up, turning again and again to Jesus, standing on the gospel that declares we are righteous in Him.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

My wife hadn’t felt her move in over 24 hours, so she called the doctor’s office. Thinking she was overreacting, she was relatively calm when she dialed the number. But after explaining her symptoms to the nurse, she was told to come in for an immediate ultrasound.\nWhen my wife texted me that news, I rushed home from the office. I made a 40-minute drive in 20 minutes, racing as fast as I could to be at my wife’s side when the ultrasound was performed. I cried the whole way home, begging God to save my baby’s life.\nAs it turned out, the ultrasound said that everything was basically fine, aside from a few things they wanted to monitor in the following weeks. Most importantly, my little girl was alive. Whether God revived her due to my prayers, or it was simply an overreaction on our part, we thanked God. Of course, even without that scare, every time her heart took a beat, it was a miracle. He is the God of life, and He’s the only one who controls it.\nPaul tells the Corinthian church that any suffering in life is meant for God’s glory through the thanksgiving of His people. I tell this story about my daughter often, primarily as a way to comfort others who have had similar experiences. As Paul says, “this momentary light affliction” was for our benefit, so that we could increase in faith and overflow in testimony (2 Corinthians 4:17).\nIt’s not always easy in times of suffering, persecution, or trial to remember that these difficult seasons are brief in comparison to eternity with God. Paul gives this advice multiple times in his letters, no doubt because he had to learn to be content in all circumstances in his own life. Paul wasn’t perfect—he surely struggled at times to believe in God’s goodness in the midst of his many difficulties—but that didn’t make his testimony any less true. In fact, we can trust Paul’s advice precisely because he experienced so many afflictions.\nThe fear of losing my daughter wasn’t my first struggle in this lifetime, and it certainly won’t be my last. Life is fragile. The world is broken. Terrible things happen every single day. But because of my trials and tears and begging God for mercy, I now believe in Him more than ever before. And I pray He continues to use our stories to encourage others.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

His call was “come follow me” (Matthew 4:19). It was always a ministry of life on life. He came into the world and dwelt with us, and we beheld His glory. When Jesus ascended, He passed on His ministry to His disciples, to the Church, and to us—and the call is still the same: go, and make disciples (Matthew 28:19). You shall be fishers of men.\nThe gospel is not a system of behavior, though it does change our behavior. Nor is it a set of rules to follow, though in it the law is fulfilled. The gospel is Christ and His work of redemption. It is His life given to us, alive in us, making us alive in Him by His Spirit. The gospel transforms people because Christ transforms people by His own life. \nThis life-on-life transformation is what Paul speaks of to the church at Corinth. Paul calls them his “letter,” because through his ministry they came to know Christ (2 Corinthians 3:2). We are all “Christ’s letter,” made so by the Spirit of the living God. In Him is life, and if we abide in Him, and He in us, His life is ours. \nThe fruit of this life is freedom and boldness because our adequacy comes from God. We are His letter, His testimony—not our own. This is the glory of the new covenant, that the glory that is His has been given to us. It’s transforming us, so that we shall one day be like Him.\nHe has forgiven our sins and remembers them no more. Even more, He is making us like Himself. Do you hear how great is our privilege, that we should be called the children of God, that we should be His witnesses, and live in His life? If we have already received such a great treasure, how much more should we seek to walk in this new life! We ought to make every effort to seize hold of this life, and seek its transforming power. \nHow do we do this? \nThe answer is unique to the gospel, but it is the same as it has always been: Abide in Him. The veil that once separated us from Him has been removed. When you sit in your house, as you walk by the way, as you break bread, remain in the Word, walk by the Spirit, and abide in Christ. When we see Him as He is, we are transformed. May He so transform our hearts and lives and use us as His effective letters and witnesses to a watching world.\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

Not only had the prodigal son squandered his entire life savings and well-being, but in the process he had shamed and dishonored his entire family. His actions and words had effectively told his father he wished he were dead. As he walked back to his boyhood home, I imagine he dreaded the reunion with his family. How would they receive him? How would their judgmental gaze feel when they saw him? Would his father even speak to him? (Luke 15:11-32).\nFor the Corinthian church, this challenge stood before them as well. While we are left to guess the details of the situation Paul describes in 2 Corinthians 2, it is apparent that someone in the church had deeply sinned and wronged the body. Paul speaks of that person causing “pain,” not only to him but to the entire church (v. 5). The sin was devastating to the believers in Corinth. And yet, standing on the other side of the door, like the prodigal son, was this wretch of a human broken by his deeds and asking for restoration and forgiveness. How would they respond?\nRooted in the reality of the gospel, Paul calls the church to display the very forgiveness they have received in Christ. Instead of keeping the repentant outcast at an arm’s length and shunning him, the reality of the gospel calls them to “reaffirm your love to him” (v. 8). More than being a kind gesture, this is a test to the church. The test being this: Do you really understand the gospel? Does your understanding translate into obedience to the gospel?\nHerein lies the test for us as well. How do we receive those who have sinned against us? While the pain of others’ sin against us is deep, when they come to their senses and return to us repentant and asking for forgiveness, how will we respond to them? Will realities like “forgiveness” and “comfort” and “love” flow from us to those who have wounded us and our church community? Will we be “the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing?” (v. 15).\nWhen we view the nature of what Christ has done, we are confronted with the reality that this is exactly what He has done for us. He has taken our guilt upon Himself and paid for our sins in His death. He has welcomed us, forgiven us, and what’s more, He loves us! This good news for us is exactly how we are to receive those who return back in repentance. Instead of shaming and shunning, the Father restores His prodigal sons. Because He loved us first, we, too, can receive them with love (1 John 4:19).\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

He told his boys’ basketball team that crying is acceptable at “funerals and the Grand Canyon.” In another episode, Chris gets emotional over a box Ron made for him. Ron replies, “Saltwater will warp the wood, so keep your tears in your eyes where they belong.”\nWe work hard at becoming immune to life’s pain, but when we do this, we also insulate ourselves against the immense comfort God offers when times are difficult. When we learn to be honest about how hard and painful life can be, we open ourselves up to the joy that we can experience, even in our suffering.\nAside from the vision of God in chapter 6, you probably don’t hear many sermons from the first 39 chapters of Isaiah. Through the prophet, God confronted the sin and faithlessness of His people while telling them about their coming exile at the hands of the Assyrians and the Babylonians. This brutal section ends with Isaiah telling Hezekiah that all he and his own son will be carted off to Babylon, where his sons will serve as eunuchs for the king (Isaiah 36–41). For a people who heard they would live forever in a land filled with milk and honey, this came as startling news.\nGod broke into this stark reality with words that would make His people glad: “Comfort, comfort my people” (Isaiah 40:1). While pain and suffering will come, they will not have the final word. God promised there would be a time when Jerusalem’s warfare would end and her sin would be forgiven. This is what God does over and over. He steps into our pain, even the pain we bring upon ourselves, speaking words of comfort and bringing peace to our weary souls. \nThe comfort God brings to us in our pain ultimately comes through the suffering of Christ Jesus. While we were foolish, running headlong into our sin and bringing misery upon ourselves, God demonstrated His love towards us by sending Christ to die in our place (Romans 5:8). He took our sin, misery, and guilt upon Himself, and in exchange, we get to experience His comfort and peace.\nPaul didn’t pretend life wasn’t hard. In fact, 2 Corinthians catalogued Paul’s sufferings in a way no other letter he wrote did. He spoke of beatings, imprisonments, cold, want, and the pressure of caring about the well-being of the churches he’d founded. He knew affliction and pain. He didn’t hide it; he wore it on his sleeve.\nYet, Paul testified that even though we know something of the afflictions Christ bore, through Him we can also know the abundant comfort God gives. We don’t minimize our pain. We don’t explain away our sufferings. “For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so also through Christ our comfort overflows” (2 Corinthians 1:5). When we honestly acknowledge our suffering, we can trust that God will meet us there in our pain, ministering to us with overwhelming comfort.\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

Then, as now, “all” means all. \n“My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus” (1 Corinthians 16:24).\nWhen it came to the Lord’s work, Paul did not adhere to any hierarchy of persons. In one breath he advocates for Timothy. In the next, he respects the plans Apollos has in place. Then he turns to throw major kudos in the direction of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus. And then he ensures that Aquila and Prisca get name recognition. Paul went to great lengths—not only in letters, but also in life—to make sure all meant all. As one who had experienced the grace of the Lord Jesus, Paul was serious about sharing with others what was shared with him.\nBut even within that wide net, Paul kept an eye on those in need. 1 Corinthians 16 starts out with pointed words regarding “the collection for the saints” (v. 1). Paul was clear. As you prosper, don’t forget to set some aside for those who are not. It is these verses that Leviticus refers to, Moses was clear: Don’t harvest it all. Leave a margin there for others (Leviticus 23:22). Such intentional kindness was truly a facet of the Lord’s work, a tie to bind the people together so that all always meant all.\nI’ve witnessed this repeatedly in the life of my pastor-father as he has been grandfather (Papa) to my children, and also to my nieces. I wrote a poem about this in my book Know When To Hold ‘Em: The High Stakes Game of Fatherhood (Abingdon Press, 2013).

Preaching her funeral sermon and standing by her graveside were the most difficult things I have had to do in life. A friend of mine reached out to me and said, “Nick, when you stand by your mother’s grave, remember this is resurrection ground.” Another friend comforted me with these words: “It’s at the graveside that we strengthen ourselves in the truth that the gospel really works.” My mother was a sincere and devoted follower of Christ. When Christ returns, she will rise from the dead unto eternal life. Right now she is “asleep in Jesus.”\nWhen the Scriptures speak of the death of believers, they do so under the idea of “sleep.” Before raising the little girl from the dead, Jesus told the crowds “the girl is not dead but asleep” (Matthew 9:24). When He took His disciples to the grave of Lazarus, in order to raise His friend from the dead, Jesus said, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I’m on my way to wake him up” (John 11:11). And here in 1 Corinthians 15, the apostle Paul says, “We will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed” ( v. 51). Death for the believer is as if he or she is merely asleep because the certainty of the resurrection is the hope of God raising them to immortality. \nPart of the resurrection awakening we await is for our departed loved ones in Christ to awaken to a transformed and glorified body. We will have the same bodies we have now, but they will be transformed into the likeness of the glorified Christ. When He comes, Jesus will impart the glory that is now His to those who are united to Him, whether in the graves or still alive on the earth when He returns. Scripture is clear that God will wake those who have fallen asleep in Jesus first, and then He will bring those believers who are still alive to Himself. Our frail, mortal, sinful flesh will be automatically made new, immortal, and sinless in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. How we should long for that day!\nWhen the Scriptures speak of the hope of believers, it always does so by reminding us of these precious truths about the resurrection and glorification of our bodies. Whether it is the raising of those who sleep in Jesus, or the transformation of those who are still alive when He comes, we look with eager anticipation to that day. We long to be reconciled with those who have gone before us; but more than that, we long to be with them in the presence of Christ in glory.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n\n                ",

Yet for Paul, this reality was important to note hand-in-hand with our key verse for today: “Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures” (v.3). \nMany of us grew up in Christian traditions that emphasized a prayer of repentance which leads to immediate salvation and reconciliation with God. Praise God for that! There is much scriptural basis for this invitation (e.g., Romans 10:9). However, if we’re not careful to balance this beautiful exchange with Paul’s message in 1 Corinthians, we miss an important truth. We are being saved—currently, permanently, but also in process. \nThis does not negate the beautiful, mysterious transformation that happens the moment you enter into repentance in the name of Jesus for the first time, but rather it helps us grasp the manner in which Jesus is constantly interceding on our behalf and making us more like Him. \nDuring the day in, day out grind, it’s easy to lean on that initial moment of repentance, while overlooking the majestic exchange in which we’re currently participating. Perhaps that’s why Paul’s first words on the resurrection to the Corinthians are “Now I would remind you…” (1 Corinthians 15:1, ESV). He knew then, exactly what we experience today: it’s easy to become complacent in our pursuit of the spiritual. Said another way, our spiritual memory is short, and our spiritual vision constantly needs to be refocused. \nHave you ever bought a new car? Or a new-to-you car? There’s usually an excitement and happiness that comes on the heels of a purchase like that. But it doesn’t take long for the shiny, new feeling to wear off. Pretty soon, it’s just your daily ride, part of your routine. \nThis sort of experience is really common for believers as well. The shiny, new feeling of salvation wears off, and we can start to lose focus, passion, and energy in our walk with God. I wonder if you’ve ever had a season like this. Maybe, you’re walking in one now. \nPaul’s words to the Corinthian believers are relevant to us today. Though it’s easy to let your walk with God drift to the back burner when you lose passion about the newness of your salvation, we’re called to remember the newness of each and every day. Christ died for our sins in 33 AD, but He is going about the work of saving you each and every day in 2018, 2019, and beyond! We are being saved, and with that confession, we can celebrate the newness and wonder of how we’re being redeemed and transformed each and every moment.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

It’s his sole mission—to pull people away from Christ—and he excels at it. One of the devil’s most devious and effective methods is stirring up dissension and debate within the church, what Scripture calls a spirit of confusion. We get mired in arguments, frustration, judgment, preferential tug-o-war, and all of it under the guise of defending truth or seeking good things. In reality, though, we’ve forgotten the reason for church: joining together to worship and reflect Jesus. Confusion has defeated us, and that’s what this passage in 1 Corinthians 14 is about. \nHere, Paul sets out to offer clarity, the opposite of confusion. From the top, he says he wishes people would pursue love and desire spiritual gifts, and he follows that up a few verses later by saying that all gifts are for the good of the church, to build one another up. This is Paul’s thesis, and everything else in the passage points to that. \nOur temptation is to tie others and ourselves in knots with debates over speaking in tongues and prophecy. What do they mean? How should people do them? Are they gifts for everyone? These questions matter enormously, and they’re also a temptation—a temptation toward confusion and distraction. \nWe can never forget that we are to “seek to excel at building up the church” so that, “everyone may learn and everyone may be encouraged” (vv. 12,31). This is why God grants gifts of the Spirit, and anything that doesn’t move the church in this direction is of a false spirit, as 1 John chapter 4 tells us. We are to test the spirits (vv.1–6). If this sounds oddly mystical or confusing, John clarifies: \nDoes the spirit profess Christ or does it not?\nDoes it point people to Jesus or distract them?\nDoes it diminish Jesus or make Him bigger? \nThis is a sharp knife to divide the false spirits from the true, and the helpful gifts from the unhelpful. \nWe ignore these instructions at our own peril and at the peril of our churches. We are called to be a sanctuary, a dwelling place of God, both individually and corporately. But when we allow chaos and confusion to supersede Jesus, we stop being a church and become nothing more than a gathering of people. Only when we seek to excel in building up the church with spiritual gifts, confessing Christ above all else, will we be the church God calls us to be through Paul’s words.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I love the author E. B. White. I grew up reading (and crying my way through) Charlotte’s Web. It remains one of my favorite stories of all time. Right now, I have a collection of White’s essays on my nightstand. That man can write. Boy, can he write. I read one essay he wrote about the hens on his farm. I don’t really care that much about hens, but the way White wrote about them made the experience of reading about them pure joy. I could have read about his hens all day.\nWhite’s collection of essays is just that—a gathering of pieces that stand on their own, having no real connection to the other essays in the book. Charlotte’s Web, on the other hand, is a story. Each chapter connects to the others. They work together to convey a cohesive body of information.\nFirst Corinthians is not a collection of essays, where each chapter is its own thing, independent of what comes before or what follows. It is a letter, and like Charlotte’s Web, is meant to be read as a cohesive work. \nIn my experience, we seldom read 1 Corinthians 13 in this way. More often than not, we lift it up out of its context and treat it like a stand-alone love poem suitable for weddings and cross-stitch. And it certainly works on that level. But when we consider this famous chapter of Scripture in its actual context, it reads less like a love song and more like a rebuke.\nLet’s walk back a bit in the text. In chapters 10–12, Paul rebukes the Corinthian believers for not caring enough about each other’s consciences, for indifference to sexual immorality, for dressing in ways that would have been provocative in their culture, for gorging themselves at the Lord’s Supper while their poorer neighbors sit beside them hungry, for being confused about the value of various gifts and abilities. In other words, the Corinthian believers are struggling to live selflessly. They’re struggling to put each other’s needs and consciences above their own. They’re struggling to love one another.\nThen comes 1 Corinthians 13. If I have the most amazing gifts and popularity, but no love, I’m just making noise. If I’m the smartest, most devout person in the room, but don’t have love, I’m nothing. \nAnd what is love?\n“Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not envy, it is not boastful, it is not arrogant” (v. 4). Love is the opposite of what they’re being to one another.\nI like reading this chapter in the context of what came before it, rather than as a stand-alone piece. Reading this chapter as a word of correction, rather than as a flowery love poem, gives it teeth. It raises the stakes. As you read, think of someone you struggle to love, maybe someone you look down on in some way, for some reason, and ask the Lord to search your heart through His Word and help you see where you fail to love.\nAfter all, when we come to the end of this life, with all our struggles, pride, and resentments, those things will all fall away. Only love will remain. So why not receive these words from Paul as a correction, and practice the art of loving well now?\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I’m sure the debate will end at some point, but for now, people love a good debate on who the greater basketball player is: Michael Jordan or LeBron James. You can compare championships, MVP awards, games played, points per game—stat after stat—and no decisive winner is proclaimed. The divide over Air Jordan and King James is a hallmark of NBA discussion. Everyone wants their guy to be the guy. No one wants to be the lesser, and sadly, this stat-and-status war can be found in the local church, too.\nThe Corinthians were struggling with spiritual gifts. They weren’t having a hard time exercising them—they were exalting them. They were comparing stats. Who has what gift? Who plays what role? They were dividing themselves over their differences, demeaning the unifying power of Christ’s cross, resurrection, and impartation of the Holy Spirit. They found their identity in what they did for Jesus, rather than who they were in Him. \nBrothers, we are not our ministries. Christ defines us. Just as we are prone to do, the Corinthians were turning the gifts of the Spirit into status symbols, assuming that people who have been given “Gift A” are more important, vital, and spiritual than people who have the less flashy, middle of the road, “Gift M.” Paul crushes this division with a vision of the body; toes, nose hairs, and eyelids are all a part of the whole. No one is more or less a part of the body than anyone else.\nWhy do we lift up the preachers and teachers among us and look right past the sound guys, the setup crew, and the people who print the bulletins? Don’t downplay your role, via the gifting of the Spirit, in your local church. Your service, encouragement, and giving matter to the mission of God. But don’t overplay your gifts either. We forget that the Spirit is at work in all of us. From the seminary-trained preacher to the volunteer children’s ministry teacher, and from the hands and feet to the vocal cords, the Holy Spirit is at work.\nWhen we remember that it’s the Spirit who is at work in our local church, we are less likely to compare stats and status. When we know this truth we will see, as Paul says, that “the members would have the same concern for each other. So if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it” (1 Corinthians 12:25–26). Sure, we all have different gifts, but the source is the same Spirit. Everyone is valuable. God made it so.\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

And I remember playing with the little plastic cups after they were used.  \nOnce, when I was no more than eight years old, our church had communion on a Sunday evening. It must’ve been during the summer or over a holiday weekend, because after church I spent the night at my friend Chris’s house. His older siblings had brought home a bunch of those plastic cups and set up a communion table in their bedroom. We munched on crackers and used the cups to drink tiny cups of Kool-Aid. We laughed a lot that night, walking the line between irreverent play and doing what Jesus commanded of us (1 Corinthians 11:17-26).\nIt wasn’t until a few years ago that I began to truly appreciate the bread and the cup. Our bank account was empty—not an exaggeration. Everything in the house seemed to be breaking. I was miserable at my job. Vocationally, I felt lost. \nI knew the gospel was true. Objectively true. But the application was getting obscured by a cloudy dark night of the soul. There were few stars shining to steer by. No sermon seemed to help, though we faithfully attended church. I even taught Sunday School every now and again. Nothing I read gave any relief either.\nOne Sunday I was not very happy about going to church. So I prayed and asked God to give me something to hang some hope on, some word that would encourage me. What I was really after was a word of hope. Something I could hold on to. \nThat Sunday we had communion. I can remember looking down at the bread and the cup as I held them, one in each hand. Something I could hold on to. And then the pastor spoke Jesus’ words: “This is my body which is for you… This cup is the new covenant in my blood” (vv. 24-25). For the first time in a long time, I felt like I could hold on to something. When I drank from the cup, I was drinking in a promise of grace, mercy, and love made by the resurrected King. Since that Sunday, I have enjoyed the Lord’s Supper as a physical sermon of God’s covenant love for His people. \nJesus commanded us to eat the bread and drink the cup “in remembrance” of Him—to remind us of who He is, and who we are to Him. He wanted us to hang our hope on to something true, as represented by the broken bread and the poured-out cup. It’s not our faith we are hanging on to, but Jesus.\nWritten by Matthew B.

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In our culture, it is not uncommon to hear someone say, “I have the right to do what I want to do for my own good,” especially in areas of personal choice and life decisions. At the heart of this statement is a belief that our identity is founded on and formed by these expressions of personal freedom.\nThis pursuit of “doing what’s best for me” is as old as the garden of Eden. We are all lovers of self by nature. In fact, the Bible presupposes self-love. This is why the command to “love [others] as yourself” is so deeply unsettling (Matthew 22:39). It means that we have to love others with the same amount of energy, force, and sacrifice that we do for ourselves. It should be no surprise then that in our culture, people’s consciousness is so bound by self-love.\nHowever, in matters of the Christian’s personal conscience, the Bible is clear: “No one is to seek his own good, but the good of the other person” (1 Corinthians 10:24). The pursuit of good toward others is the ultimate expression of love. We do to others what we would have them do for us, even when it curtails our own desires and freedoms. \nJesus Christ provided the ultimate expression of this command in His loving pursuit of good for the sake of others. Christ gave up many freedoms to secure our salvation. Now as ambassadors for Christ, we are called to give up many personal rights and preferences, so that others may receive and enjoy His salvation too. This is not always easy, since our sinful hearts often tempt us to insist on our own rights at the expense of others. \nTo make matters even more complex, there are also times when we must pursue our freedoms in order to confront the legalism of others. Regardless, the heart of the issue here can be stated in a simple but heart-searching question, namely, “How does this choice or decision honor God, love others, and promote the gospel?” \nAs Christians, our identity is found in Christ, and our identity is formed as we imitate Christ. In Him we see the greatest form of love the world has ever known. He died for our good and our gain. Now, we are called to die to self for the good of others. \nIn a culture fully drunk on self-love, it’s easy for people to reason, “I have the right to do what I want to do for my own good.” Yet, we as Christians are called to live out the biblical law of love which says, “I will lay down my rights for the good of others.”\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

Sometimes it’s disagreement over certain policies or ideas or practices. Sometimes it’s disagreement with your entire philosophy.\nPaul felt this opposition regularly. He was often criticized for his theological views, the practices of his ministry, and the people he associated with. In fact, he was critical of other leaders at times too (Galatians 2:11-13). At some level, leaders are always out front, which means the crosshairs find them quite easily. And frankly, folks are often quick to point a finger when something goes wrong.\nWhile Paul is explaining, and even defending, his leadership here, it is riddled with principles we all can learn from. In short, every Christian is called to make disciples, and so every Christian is a leader. So what does Paul say about his own ministry?\nFirst, he explains that he has a right to be in leadership. He tells the Corinthians that he was called by Jesus, and therefore, should be able to minister to them and should be supported by them. The Corinthian church’s faith is proof of that. They were “the seal of [his] apostleship in the Lord” (1 Corinthians 9:2).\nSecond, he roots his leadership in Scripture. He defends his teaching and philosophy not on worldly wisdom or cultural customs, but on what he believes God’s Word says. He is not a false teacher. The Bible can back him up on that.\nFinally, he tells them that his ministry is not selfish. He wants them to know that all he does is for the good of others. He humbles himself in every situation in order to serve, and he is not a compromiser. The fact that he has rooted his ministry in God’s call and biblical truth validates that.\nAll of us can learn from Paul here. As ministers of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:16-21), we are called by God to lead others in biblical truth and servant-hearted humility. Regardless of opposition, if we are grounded in this, God can use us just as He used Paul.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Christian liberty is easy to abuse. The truth that we’ve been freed from bondage to the law can quickly turn into the notion that we are free to be a law unto ourselves. We are naturally bent selfward, and so we are inclined to bend grace selfward as well. \nBut the heart of the gospel of grace is not that we are beholden to no one, but that we belong wholly to Someone. We are Christ’s. Because we are His, we are free from the bondage of the law, but we are also free from the bondage to self and all the idols our hearts will invent.\nFor this reason, Paul can say to the Corinthians, “Food will not bring us close to God. We are not worse off if we don’t eat, and we are not better if we do eat” (1 Corinthians 8:8). Our liberty in Christ is not bound by idols or enslavement to them (1 John 5:21), nor by slavish asceticism from God’s good gifts, for all things are from Him. At the same time, our liberty is not for self-serving. Indeed, true liberty is not chiefly about the self, but about what is good. For this reason, we can see several principles quite clearly:\nFirst, our liberty in Christ is for freedom. “For freedom Christ has set us free,” Paul writes in Galatians 5:1. To use freedom to return to sin is to use freedom to return to bondage.\nSecond, our liberty in Christ is for service, and this service is defined by love. “Love builds up,” says Paul, and this is the object of Christian liberty (1 Corinthians 8:1). It is for seeking the kingdom, for the building up of the body, for loving our neighbors.\nThird, our liberty in Christ is for His glory alone. Christ has set us free that we might be His. He knows His own, and His own know His voice (John 10:14). Any exercise of liberty that does not honor Christ is no liberty at all.\nIndeed, “all things are from him, and we exist for him” (1 Corinthians 8:6). Christ has set us free. Thanks be to God! Let us therefore walk in that freedom, in love, in service, in honoring Christ, by the power of His Spirit, who has sealed us for His kingdom.\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

I felt I had all the right reasons for needing him to step into this role, but his perspective on what was urgent and most important was quite different from my own. His concern was for his wife, whose life was on a countdown clock—one cancer had created and hadn’t given a definitive answer of when time would be up. For him, knowing that her time was short, he wouldn’t find himself in any leadership or ministry capacity apart from her. The urgency of time shaped the way he stewarded his marriage. It should shape ours as well. \nThe Corinthians had inquired of Paul regarding some issues they were trying to sort out. Namely, questions about marriage, singleness, and divorce, and the timing of all those things, rang in their minds. The church wondered if the return of Christ was at hand and the end of the age was near. It was enough for them to wonder what they should do with their relationships.\nThe instruction Paul gives them in 1 Corinthians 7 is just as relevant for us today as it was then. Married believers should love and serve each other in the way marriage is intended to be demonstrated (vv.1-7). Marriage is indeed good, and married believers should not divorce or abandon their spouses (vv.10-11). If you are married to an unbeliever and they want to stay married, then do so (vv.12-16). Single people can pursue marriage, although it may be wise to remain unmarried if you possess the gift of singleness (vv.8-9, 25-35). And in whatever station in life you find yourself at this present time, choose to “remain with God” (v.24). \nThe point is that, given the brevity of life and the serious nature of the times, Scripture calls us not to squander our current relationships, but instead to be better managers of them all the more. “God has called [us] to live in peace” with one another (v.15). And though “time is limited” and “this world in its current form is passing away” (vv.29, 31), Paul says these things serve to give us a right perspective on our lives and relationships.\nThe brevity of our lives should motivate us to walk with one another in dignity, love, and integrity. In light of the passing times, we are called to steward our singleness or marriages well. Whatever the case may be, we are to devote our relationships to the Lord.\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

Whether it’s the frustration of continued thoughts you think you can’t control, falling victim to the lure of pornography, committing acts of sexual immorality, or dealing with urges that feel unnatural—no man is exempt from the lusts of the flesh and the damage they do.\nWe sin, and then we are convicted of that sin in our hearts, as we should be. In 1 Corinthians 6, the apostle Paul reminds us, “You are not your own, for you were bought at a price” (vv.19-20). But when we forget who we are in Christ Jesus, we turn away from Him because we feel guilt and shame, rather than turning toward Him in repentance. Then, because we don’t know how to handle our guilt and shame, we feel powerless, plunging deeper and deeper into the pit. \nThe cycle is vicious, relentless. We don’t know where to turn. Telling friends doesn’t seem like an option because the shame is too much to bear. Talking to a pastor feels ridiculous because we imagine he surely doesn’t know what it’s like to deal with these sins, let alone the guilt and shame that seem to render prayer impossible.\nBut men, there is good news for you today. Jesus died for you. He didn’t just give Himself up for your “respectable” sins. He died, bearing the guilt and shame for the things you don’t want anyone else to know about. Cleansing, healing, forgiveness, and restoration are all possible for you because of your Savior who loves you.\nIn addition, this good news has the resources to help you experience real change and victory over your sin. Again, in 1 Corinthians 6, Paul walks through a laundry list of sins that make one unfit for the kingdom, and it includes many of our pet sins and temptations. We read this list and surely hear that we will not inherit the kingdom. But Paul’s next sentences should make our hearts sing: “And some of you used to be like this. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God” (v.11).\nDid you catch the past tense in those verses? Christian, you are no longer defined by your struggles, failures, and shame. You are defined by the new identity you have in Christ. You have been declared righteous before God, you have been cleansed by God, and you have been set apart from your sins by God the Father, in the name of His Son, by the power of the Spirit. You are new.\nStop that.\nWork harder.\nBe better. \nThese commands never changed one heart, and they won’t give you victory over your hidden sins—but the gospel will. In Christ, you are clean. In Christ, you are new. In Christ, you are empowered by the Spirit. In Christ, you have brothers who will help you in your faith journey. These are the words you need. They are true and they bring real life, real change, and real joy.\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

They’d say, “Would you do this (or say that) if you knew Jesus were right there beside you? Because He is, you know. He is.” \nThe author Brennan Manning referred to this as “the present risenness of Christ.” Manning’s emphasis was similar in kind to those mothers, but minus the fear factor. The ragamuffin writer prayed you and I would be constantly aware of and in awe of Christ’s living presence with us, and that it might embolden us to do the next thing in love, whatever that may be. Manning might say, “Wouldn’t you do that if you knew Jesus were right there with you? Because He is, you know. He is.”\nOf course, the common ground between mothers and Manning is that even though Christ’s body is not here, His Spirit is. He is, you know. And as such, this has implications for our lives. The apostle Paul tried to communicate the same thing to the believers in Corinth concerning their trouble-ridden church, as well as some much needed discipline: “Even though I am absent in the body, I am present in spirit” (1 Corinthians 5:3).\nAnd leave it to the apostle Paul to embody the best of both the mothers and Manning. It’s as if he were saying to the Corinthians, “I may not be there in the flesh, but I’m still there. I love you, but there’s something going on that’s not right. And since I love you, let’s do the right thing in response to it.” It takes both of those aspects for anything even remotely related to true church discipline, as Paul envisioned it, to work.  \nUnfortunately, we too often see it played out one-sided. To err on one side is to slide toward “an angry God,” who is just waiting in the wings for us to mess up. And to err on the other side is to ease into the arms of “a permissive God,” who wants us to be all we can be, which God truly does, but not at the expense of His holiness. Call it what you will—tough and tender, truth and grace—but that Christlike combination is absolutely necessary if our desire is to not grow weary, to not lose heart in doing good. \nAnd is such discipline and goodness achievable in this life? A chorus of witnesses, including our mothers and Manning and Paul, would say, “Yes.” Because God is right here with us. He is, you know. He is.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    On numerous occasions, people have told me that they reject the idea of an infinite God who does what He wants for His own glory. In response to such assertions, I sometimes say, “Well, we’re finite, and by nature, we want to do whatever we want for our own glory! Why would it be wrong for God—that being of which there is none greater—to seek His own glory?” \nThe sad reality of life in this fallen world is that we are all hungry for the applause of others. Scripture teaches us that we are either seeking the praise of men or the praise of God. This is an important recurrent theme in the letters from the apostle Paul, whose reputation was constantly demeaned by men who presented themselves to the members of the church as being “super apostles.” They sought to convince the Corinthian church that they were superior to Paul because of their credentials, gifts, and accomplishments, and they boasted in them constantly. In order to help the members of the church learn to think properly about who is truly approved by God, Paul taught a valuable lesson on stewardship.  \nThe apostle constantly viewed himself as a steward in the house of God. He considered the ministry to which Christ had called him as something precious and entrusted to him. He wanted to be found faithful to carrying out the work of the gospel in the church and in the world. Paul was motivated by a desire to bring glory to God—not for himself to be praised by other men. \nIt is far too easy to start wanting to serve in the church or in ministry for the applause of men. We can do this very subtly. Many of us are skilled at what is known as the “humble-brag.” We may not appear to be overtly seeking the praise of men, but our desire to number the size and scope of our service shows that we are seeking it in more covert ways. \nAt the end of our lives, the only praise that will matter is that which comes from the only true and living God. “And then praise will come to each one” from Him (1 Corinthians 4:5). Everything about our lives right now is just scaffolding. Once the scaffolding is taken down at judgment day, God will reveal who He has approved as being a faithful steward, and who He has not. \nAs we look to the Lord Jesus, and labor to bring Him glory, we find we care less and less about the praise of men, and more and more about the praise that will come from our living God. May God give us grace to seek that praise continually. And may we seek to bring Him the glory for His mercy, grace, and goodness to us in Christ.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When Paul proclaims, “God’s temple is holy, and that is what you are” (1 Corinthians 3:17), he is offering a profound encouragement and a heartfelt challenge. Both this encouragement and challenge were initially meant to stir the Corinthian believers from a lackadaisical approach to their spiritual walk, but it also applies to our everyday circumstances even now. \nWithin that powerful declaration there are two clear messages from Paul. The first is a celebration of your deepest reality: In Christ you are holy. You are seen by God as such, and you have the glorious spiritual benefit of not only walking with Him now, but also walking into the fullness of eternity with Him. \nHowever, the second message is a word of caution: a clear marker of participation in the temple is that you are intentionally pursuing holiness. When Paul says, “Don’t you yourselves know that you are God’s temple and that the Spirit of God lives in you?” (v.16), he is issuing a subtle challenge. Much like when a loving parent asks their child, “Are you supposed to be doing that?” Or, if Paul were to say, “Have you forgotten that you are God’s temple? Because sometimes it’s a little hard to tell by how you’re acting.”\nWe need only look back to earlier in the chapter to see that Paul is concerned about the spiritual progress of the believers at Corinth: “For my part, brothers and sisters, I was not able to speak to you as spiritual people but as people of the flesh, as babies in Christ” (v.1). Paul seems both frustrated and genuinely concerned. The Corinthians were crawling when they should have been running.\nI wonder how this passage first struck you in your reading today. Were you encouraged by being able to participate in the temple, encouraged that you are intimately connected to God and His people? Or were you challenged by Paul’s stern cautioning? Was there something in your spirit that quickly identified areas of your life where you need to pursue holiness and growth? Maybe it was a both/and situation for you. Paul certainly wanted both for his readers, and I’ve come to believe that God wants both for us today. \nWhen you feel those waves of attack, telling you that you’ve lost your worth, lean into the reality of the temple. You are God’s servants: holy, redeemed, forgiven, and sent with a purpose. When you know you’re not investing what you should into your growth and relationship with God, heed the challenge and respond to the call. You’ve been set on a journey toward wholeness and holiness. Keep your eyes fixed on Jesus and refuse to falter! This is the way of a temple people.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

We don’t understand the Spirit’s work, so we don’t consider His work often enough. Oh, how misguided we are in this. Consider first what we see of the Spirit in these verses, keeping in mind that this is but a fragment of who He is and what He does.\nThe Spirit searches the depths of God and knows the thoughts of God—the same God of whom the Bible says His knowledge is too wonderful for us and no one can be His counselor. But the Spirit knows the wisdom and complexity and infinity of God’s mind, motives, movements. \nNow God has revealed these things to us by the Spirit, since the Spirit searches everything,\neven the depths of God (1 Corinthians 2:10).\nThis same Spirit is the power and clarity of God’s Word. The reason Scripture is living and active is because the Spirit communicates it to a believer’s soul. The spiritual person, the one who is in Christ and in whom the Spirit dwells, can “evaluate everything” (v.15). That means, in part, that we have eyes to see and ears to hear what Scripture says, and also a mind to understand it. Through this knowledge we can evaluate everything else we see and hear according to what the Spirit has spoken to us.\nLest you think the Spirit offers only distant knowledge or impersonal communication, consider what Romans tells us: He helps us in our weakness and intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words (8:26). This means when we are unable to pray, lacking words to communicate with God, the Spirit who knows the mind of God takes our yearnings and carries them to God on our behalf. \nThe Spirit is more, even, than what we have seen in these verses. Ephesians 1 tells us that we are “sealed by the Holy Spirit” in Christ, and that the Spirit is a “down payment of our inheritance” (vv.13-14). This is what every believer in Christ Jesus is because we have the Spirit dwelling within us: We are sealed and guaranteed. Our place as firstborn in God’s family is guaranteed. The promise of glory is locked in because we carry the Spirit within us.\nIn these four truths (and there are so many more throughout God’s Word) we see the Spirit woven into every aspect of our faith and Christian life, imparting to us the wisdom of God, and interceding on our behalf before the Father. He is God indwelling us, sealing our faith, and guaranteeing the promise of eternal life with Jesus. No longer can we overlook or underplay the Holy Spirit.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    As you read Paul’s letters to the Corinthian church, you might notice from time to time that his tone sounds angry. That’s because he is fighting for them, which sometimes looks like fighting with them. What is Paul fighting for? \nUnity. \nPaul wants the church in Corinth to embrace its identity in Christ. He wants them to know “we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and we were all given one Spirit to drink” (1 Corinthians 12:13). He wants them to realize that we were called by God into fellowship with His Son (1 Corinthians 1:9). This is the basis for our call to unity. \nPaul uses this image of being one body in a variety of ways throughout these letters. He writes about how our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, meant for holy purposes (1 Corinthians 6). He writes about the Lord’s Supper, when believers gather together to partake of the body of our Lord (1 Corinthians 11). He talks about how the Church is one body, made up of many parts (1 Corinthians 12). He writes about the resurrection of Jesus’ body, and how believers will experience that same resurrection (1 Corinthians 15). He encourages the Corinthian Christians to give to others in need because they are one (2 Corinthians 8). \nThe image of a body is a great picture of the Church. Just as we want each part of our physical bodies to function in unified and healthy ways, this should be our vision for the Church. Believers in Jesus are not merely a collection of individuals who share a Savior. We are one, united in Christ. This unity lies at the heart of these letters.\nSo here at the beginning of this reading plan, maybe a good place to start is by asking: where do you need to pursue unity? Is there anyone with whom you need to seek peace? If you aren’t sure how to answer those questions, ask the Lord to show you if there are any relationships in your life that need mending. Ask God to fight for your heart.\nAs you read through 1 and 2 Corinthians, think about what it means that the Church is one body made up of many parts. Think about what it means to live in that unity. Consider what it means to be part of the body of Christ.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When my oldest son, Jonah, was still a baby, just nine or ten months old, I decided to shave off my beard. Now, I realized that he might have a reaction to my bare face, since my fuzzy visage was all he’d ever known, but I wasn’t prepared for just how pronounced his reaction was. For hours after the reveal, whenever I tried to hold him or even come near, he’d cry uncontrollably and push me away. I was a stranger. I couldn’t be his dad, not with those pitiful, hairless cheeks.\nEventually, Jonah and I worked it out. He stopped crying long enough to hear my voice clearly, and slowly but surely he came to recognize me as the man who tossed him in the air with reckless precision, who fed him his bottle before bedtime, and who tucked him in every night with his special song. (For the record, I have grown my beard back in full, and if I even hint that I might someday shave it again, Jonah counters, “But then I won’t know you, Daddy!”)\nAt the end of Galatians, Paul does something to make sure the Galatians can “recognize” him. He stops dictating the letter to his scribe and picks up the stylus himself: “Look at what large letters I use as I write to you in my own handwriting” (Galatians 6:11). In other words, “It’s really me here on the other end of this conversation. It’s Paul! Your friend!” Paul’s personal relationship with the Christians in Galatia went deeper than any logical or biblical argument he could make to steer them away from the false teaching that threatened to rob them of the true gospel and steal their joy. So, his final appeal is to tell his friends about his scars.\n“I bear on my body the marks of Jesus” (Galatians 6:17). Paul had been persecuted just about everywhere he went—imprisoned, beaten, and left for dead more than once. He could have saved himself a world of hurt, at least from the Jews who opposed him, if he would have just advocated for circumcision in his calls to repentance. But that would be changing the gospel of grace into a gospel of works. He believed so strongly that Jesus, and Jesus alone, was enough that he could not compromise, not for all the comforts in the world.\nDo you believe Jesus is enough? Or have you believed the lie that there’s something you must do to earn eternal life with God? The gospel is the most precious and priceless message that’s ever been shared. Paul stands in good company with all those, down through the centuries, who have suffered for a gospel that can seem just too good to be true. Thank Jesus today for the gospel of grace. And may we pray for one another with these final words of Paul here in Galatians: “Brothers and sisters, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen” (Galatians 6:18).\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

But Kevan wasn’t content to see life at “belt-buckle level,” as he calls it. So, a few years ago, he left his wheelchair at the Atlanta airport and boarded a plane for Europe. Kevan toured three countries, visiting places that lack handicap-accessible ramps, places that would normally be off-limits to someone with his disability. He even scaled Skellig Michael, a steep mountain island off the coast of Ireland.\nHow did Kevan do all this? He has friends. Five friends accompanied Kevan and took turns carrying him using a specially-designed backpack, making it possible for Kevan to experience things that would have been impossible on his own. The trip is chronicled in the book We Carry Kevan and the film The View from Here. It’s a simple but amazing story that demonstrates what can happen when we take turns carrying one another’s burdens.\nPaul wasn’t thinking of physical burdens when he wrote to the Galatians. Instead, he was thinking of spiritual ones no less debilitating—sins that so easily entangle us. Chapter five of Galatians closed with Paul instructing his friends to walk by the Spirit. Now he says, “Carry one another’s burdens; in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ” (Galatians 6:2). In other words, as we walk by the Spirit, we are to walk alongside our brothers and sisters in Christ. When someone trips headlong into sin, we are to “restore such a person with a gentle spirit” (v.1), helping them get back on their feet so they can continue to walk in “love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control” (Galatian 5:22–23).\nThe false teachers in Galatia were trying to convince the Galatian Christians they needed to be circumcised and obey certain other rules in order to fulfill the law and be real followers of Christ. But Paul says the only law that matters is “the law of Christ”—and that law is fulfilled when we “carry one another’s burdens.” After all, remember that when Jesus carried His cross through the streets of Jerusalem, falling under its weight, He was carrying our burdens. That cross was our rightful punishment, the curse we deserved for our rebellion against God. We fulfill the law of Christ when we follow Jesus’s lead, bearing the burdens of those whom we love.\nEach one of us must battle against his own flesh, the snares of the devil, and the traps of this world, but we don’t fight alone. God has given us the local church, brothers and sisters who also love the Lord, to help us. But all too often we reject this help out of pride, shame, or fear. We don’t share our struggles. We don’t ask for prayer. We don’t confess our sins. And so, we don’t have someone by our side to pick us up when we fall. We spend most of our time at “belt-buckle level,” spiritually speaking.\nJesus said, “Love one another as I have loved you” (John 15:12). If we are going to take this command seriously, we can’t live the Christian life as a solo adventure. We must go together, and we must carry one another.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I once heard a megachurch pastor describe his church as a store where people can come on Sunday mornings to be consumers of faith. He said this was by design, as Americans are generally more comfortable with transactions than they are with relationships. At a restaurant or a store, a person’s credit card gives them a special kind of power. They can have anything they see, whatever promises happiness at that particular moment. They can get their coffee personalized a thousand different ways, and while they’re waiting in the drive-thru lane for said coffee, they can order nearly any product in the world from the phone in their pocket. If we want to reach the lost for Christ, this pastor’s argument went, we ought to speak their language, and that language is consumerism.\nThis shouldn’t be controversial to say, but that is not the Christian faith. Jesus is more than a transaction. He is a Person, and the Christian life can only be lived in relationship with Him. Paul reminds the Galatians of this important truth, writing, “If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:25).\nJesus Himself modeled the kind of life Paul describes, being “led by the Spirit” (Luke 4:1). He also promised His disciples, “the Spirit of Truth… will be in you” (John 14:17) and then added, “I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you” (John 14:18, emphasis mine), and also, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him” (v.23, again, emphasis mine). When we receive the Holy Spirit, we enter into a relationship with the Father and the Son also.\nThe Christian life is not a one-and-done transaction. It’s not a one-time prayer. It’s not walking down the aisle. And it’s not merely a moment of decision. It never has been, and thanks be to God, it never will be. When we walk by the Spirit, as we are necessarily called to do, we become more like Jesus. That’s why Paul could report that the fruit of the Spirit is “love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control” (Galatians 5:22–23). That’s a pretty great description of Jesus, if I’ve ever heard one.\nJesus is alive, and those who know Him have the privilege of doing life with Him. He’s always with us through His Spirit. And that’s better than anything we can buy at a store.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

In this case, I was hiking back to our mission house one afternoon, talking with a friend. Something about the kingdom work we were doing on our trip, the spiritual conversation we were having as we walked, and the beauty of our surroundings made an impression deep inside of me. To this day, when the dwindling afternoon sunlight hits my eyes just right or I smell a certain combination of nearby ocean mists and fruit trees in bloom, I am transported to that moment.\nMy mind has taken other pictures over the years, but for reasons unknown to me, this one is the most vivid. And every time I’m taken back, the goosebumps on my arms remind me that God is present in my life, no matter my current circumstances. It’s a gift that cannot be purchased or earned. Even if I headed to the airport and boarded a flight to Kingston, I doubt the trip would have the same effect.\nThere are certain beautiful experiences in this world that cannot be maneuvered into being, the most precious of which is receiving the grace offered by God in Christ. Yet that’s precisely what the Galatian Christians were being talked into. There was a moment—a wonderful, amazing, unforgettable moment—for each and every Galatian believer, when they understood the gospel deep within and took hold of it as their own, when they surrendered to God’s love and traded their sins for Christ’s righteousness. But now a group of false teachers were telling them they had to earn God’s favor through obedience to certain aspects of Old Testament law, including circumcision. In short, they were being told to doubt the moment that everything in their life had changed.\nPaul wrote to remind the Galatians of their freedom in Christ. Jesus paid the price for their sins, so there was now nothing standing between them and the love of God. “For you were called to be free, brothers and sisters” (Galatians 5:13). But the false teachers in their midst were preaching a twisted gospel that would render Christ’s sacrifice meaningless. If salvation must be earned, the cross accomplished nothing. To turn and follow the instructions of the false teachers would be to turn away from Christ, to reject the grace He offers. It’s no wonder Paul used such harsh language in this passage: “I wish those who are disturbing you might also let themselves be mutilated!” (v.12). This is deadly serious business.\nMore powerful than a sight or a smell that can transport a person back in time, Paul’s letter to the Galatians served to remind them of the moment in their own history that was truer than every lie those false teachers could think up. But his letter wasn’t just for them. The Holy Spirit inspired Paul’s words and preserved them so that you and I, nearly two thousand years later, could receive the same reminder: In Christ, we have God’s love. There’s nothing we can do to show ourselves approved. We already are, and it’s all thanks to grace, bought and paid for on our behalf at Calvary.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

While I’ll always be grateful for the time I spent there, there were many years where I felt out of place: I was one of the only students whose parents were divorced.\nToday, that might sound strange. Sadly, divorce is an all too common reality, and many kids are growing up in single-parent or blended-family homes. But back then, in my small corner of the world, it felt like I was the only one. Through no fault of my own, I was an outsider, at least in my own head. I believed God’s biggest blessings were reserved for those families that seemed to have it all together, and I—I was just surviving. I was a Christian, and in that sense I belonged, technically, but only as a black sheep.\nThe Christians in Galatia knew what it felt like to be black sheep. As they read the Old Testament, they saw how God loved and blessed the people of Israel, the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, over and over again. The Galatian Gentiles were grafted into the family of God because of Jesus. But they were the black sheep of the family because they weren’t Jewish. Or at least that’s what they thought.\nThis is why it was so easy for false teachers to convince the Galatians they needed to become Jewish through circumcision and obedience to the law; only then could they really be Christians. But Paul showed them another way to read the Old Testament, to see themselves in the story, not as outsiders, but as real and true descendants of Abraham and heirs of God’s promises.\nLong before the law was given to Moses, there was Abraham, and he was an outsider until God invited him in, not because of anything he had done, but simply on the basis of faith. Abraham had two sons—Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael was the son of the slave woman, Hagar, and the result of Abraham taking God’s promises into his own hands. Isaac, on the other hand, was the child given to Abraham and Sarah. His birth was unnatural. It was miraculous. And it was through this miracle child, Isaac, that God’s promises came down through history.\nLike Isaac, the Galatians were “unnatural” children of God. They, too, were part of God’s family by way of a miracle. “Now you too, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise” (Galatians 4:28). God’s family is made up of men, women, and children who enter in by faith, in fulfillment of the promises God spoke to Abraham. Being a Jew or a Gentile means nothing. What matters is Christ.\nThough I spent years feeling like an outsider, a child of divorce, I understand now that divorce and brokenness and my inability to keep it all together are among the many reasons why Jesus came. As He said, “It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are sick” (Mark 2:17). We can belong to the family of God, not because of who our parents are or because of how well we obey, but simply because Jesus paid the price and invites us to enter in by faith. Thanks be to God!\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    One of my biggest fears as a parent is that my kids will reject Christianity altogether. We’re a family that doesn’t have a lot of history with the faith, and my wife and I are flying blind on almost everything. What is it like to grow up with Christian parents? No idea. We didn’t do that. What is it like to be Christian parents? We’re making it up as we go along.\nBasically I don’t want to do something that’s going to completely mess them up. (Which I know is already too late, because every parent messes up their kids to one degree or another.)\nIn our early years as parents, we tried to follow a program that claimed to be help parents raise their kids, basically, God’s way. But God’s way in that instance seemed to be a whole lot of Law, and not a lot of gospel. Children will obey the first time. They will do what they’re told. Because if they don’t, they’ll be lost. For us, the approach didn’t make us more godly parents. It did, however, feed into our insecurities and anxieties—and into our larger problem of our natural tendency to wander away from the One we love (and too often had one of us losing our cool because the kids did not obey the first time we asked them to do something). We were getting so wrapped up in trying to be a good Christian parent that we were losing our focus on the gospel.\nRemembering that particular season, I can’t help but think of what Paul wrote to the Galatians: “But now, since you know God, or rather have become known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elements?” (Galatians 4:9)\nThat, in a nutshell, summarized our problem: we were turning our eyes from what mattered most. We were parenting from a legalistic view, instead of parenting out of the gospel. Our parenting was based on the wrong foundation. We needed to point our kids—and point ourselves—to “the Rock;” to pay attention, to remember, and to tell our children about all that He has done day in and day out (Deut. 32:1-9).\nI needed this reminder yesterday. I need this today. I’m going to need this tomorrow. Everyday, I need to confront myself of this truth, because it’s so easy to wander away from it into something else. To lose sight of what really matters. But God is good. He is kind. And whenever I am out of step, I am reminded that the only hope that I have, and my kids have, is in “the man [God] has appointed;” Jesus, the man He raised from the dead (Acts 17:31). And that’s all any of us need.\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    As a kid and well into adulthood, I thought Christianity was… well, let’s just say “joyless” is the most polite thing I could say. I had friends who grew up with either Anglican or Catholic parents (I didn’t care enough to ask in all honesty) and they were required to go to catechism classes once a week up until they had their first communion. Given that I had no background with anything Christianty-related, I asked what that even was. They did not speak of it with joy. They didn’t speak of anything that sounded particularly exciting at all. Just rules, at least from their perspective. We all had enough people telling us what to do already, so if Christianity was about more rules on top of the rules I already had to deal with, I wasn’t interested.\nWhen I started reading the Bible in my 20s, and found something completely different than I was expecting. It wasn’t the drudgery that my childhood friends described. It wasn’t lists of rules and commands that left us hopeless and helpless. It was something wondrous. Life-giving, I dare say. Words that told me that God takes people who were orphaned by sin, and makes them part of His family. He adopts them as His sons and daughters (John 14:18; Rom. 8:15). Heirs, the Bible called them (Gal. 4:7).\nAnd after I believed, after I recognized the only way to the father was through the One who called Himself the “way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6), I kept noticing many people who struggled with the same sort of begrudging attitude toward Christianity that my childhood friends had with their catechism classes. They were exhausted, trying to work for what God had already given them. It was like they had forgotten that “there is no Jew or Greek, slave or free male or female; since you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Gal. 3:28). They lived as slaves instead of sons (and daughters) and heirs of the promise. I swore that this wouldn’t happen to me.\nUntil it happened to me.\nNot too long ago, I was tired, running on empty. Something was off. I was working hard—really hard—to help people see how great the gospel is. But I was working so hard that I took my eyes off the gospel’s greatness for myself. So, I turned to the Scriptures once again. And in Galatians, I was once again reminded of this good news: in Christ, I am a child of God. I am adopted into God’s family. I am an heir according to God’s promises (Gal. 3:29). And because of this, I know I am going to enjoy eternity with Him forever—not because of anything that I do, but all because of Christ, the way, the truth, and the life.\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The law does not justify, faith in Jesus does. If you live by the law then you are under a curse. It’s difficult to read these statements as anything but derogatory about the law. It cannot save and it actually condemns, so what exactly is the purpose of the law? Is there anything good about it at all?\nPaul poses this very question in Galatians 3:19. He recognizes that the previous 18 verses have seemingly diminished and undermined the law of God, the very commands God gave his people as a means of being set apart for holiness as his own. Rather than doing what we are often so prompt to do and taking an extreme position Paul answers it in a sequence of clarifying statements adding depth and nuance to our understanding of God’s plan and purpose.\nFirst, the law was “added for the sake of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise was made would come.” (v.19) Paul clarifies this a few verses later in 3:24 when says “the law, then, was our guardian until Christ.” The Old Testament law was a protective measure, a gift from God to show his people what sin was, what honoring him required, and to guide them to an understanding of righteousness.\nSecond, makes abundantly clear that the law is not contrary or in opposition to the promise of God to save through Jesus. In 3:21 he explains that the law was not given with the ability to give life. It was never designed to be the means of justification. Following the law without faith was never salvific. God gave the law to protect his people, guide his people, and teach his people their need for a true and perfect savior.\nJeremiah 31 helps us understand the connection between the law (old covenant) and the promise of Jesus (new covenant). In verses 31-34 the Lord declares that he will make a new covenant, not like the old one which Israel broke (and like we break the law). This covenant will be written on their hearts, that is, it will be believed by faith and given by the Spirit. The old covenant law paves the way for the new covenant. Hebrews 10:1 clarifies even further by describing the law as “shadow of good things to come.” The sacrifices and rituals of the old covenant law could never purify and never justify, but they echoed forward to the promised saving sacrifice of Jesus.\nSo what was the purpose of the law? It protected. It foreshadowed. It echoed. This was God’s intention, not to save through the law but to create a family for himself: “Through faith you are all sons of God in Christ Jesus.” Before Jesus their faith was in the one true God and a coming savior, and it was credited to them as righteousness. Since Jesus’ ascension our faith is in him as the perfect sacrifice, the mediator and great high priest, and the coming King.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    One of the most foundational truths of the gospel, of being a Christian, is that we are unable to save ourselves because we are sinners. In our nature we are rebellious against God and cannot make ourselves righteous and good enough to enter his perfect Holy presence and be right in his eyes. Somehow, some way, though, we convince ourselves that good works will save us and that following a moral code will gain us justification in God’s eyes. It is an easy thing to believe: do good and earn rewards. In this way we are like the Galatians.\nWhat Paul says is something much stronger than “this is incorrect” or “make some adjustments to your thinking.” He says “all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse . . . it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law.” Not only was the Galatians’ focus on law-keeping failing to save, it was keeping them under a curse of judgement by God. By depending on the law they were condemning themselves to hell.\nThank God the passage does not stop there, nor does the gospel. Paul does not leave us with bad news but rather wipes away the curse of the law by looking to Jesus in faith: “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming the curse for us.” 1 Peter 2:24 says he “bore our sins in his body on the tree,” and Isaiah 53 is rich with hope because Jesus carried our curse and stepped in to take our punishment. After verse upon verse describing Jesus’s sacrifice and burden bearing for his lost sheep it says “The Lord was pleased to crush him severely . . my righteous servant will justify many, and he will carry their iniquities.” The curse of the law was broken by the sacrifice of Jesus. We are no longer bound by the task to pushing our righteous high enough to please God only to see it fall short time and again.\nThis text offers more than personal salvation, however. The promise of salvation is not just an individual thing. This is a promise for the nations, a fulfilling of God’s covenant to Abraham. In Genesis 12: 1-7 God calls Abraham out of paganism to follow him and promises to make Abraham into a great nation. This blessing is not Abraham’s ego or world domination; it is a promise to bring hope to the world through Abraham’s offspring. “I will make your name great and you will be a blessing . . . and all the peoples on earth will be blessed through you.”\nPaul points out that the promise was not to multiple offsprings of Abraham but to one. The offspring of Abraham through whole the world is blessed is Jesus, the curse bearer. The law, which came centuries later than this promise, doesn’t change it. The law served a different purpose altogether. Salvation is through Jesus alone, and all who have faith in Jesus are members of the promise God made to Abraham, both blessed and commissioned to spread the blessing of Christ to our world.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    “Who has bewitched you?” sounds more like a question Hermione Granger might ask Ron Weasley in the Hogwarts common room than something Paul would ask the church at Galatia. It is the steroidal version of “have you lost your mind?” Yet this is how Paul addresses the Galatians right after calling them foolish. What precipitated this exasperated expression?\nThe Galatians had done what so many of us do: turned to good works (in their case this was living by the Jewish ceremonial law) as their means of justification. They were living as if their standing in the eyes of God was based on their actions. This is why Paul reacted so strongly.\nHe hammers them with rhetorical questions each of which smashes the foundation for their false sense of justification.\n“Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by believing what you heard?”\n“After beginning by the Spirit are you now finishing by the flesh?”\n“Did you experience so much for nothing?”\n“Does God give you the Spirit and work miracles among you by your doing or by works of the law?”\n“Or is it by believing what you heard—just like Abraham who believed God and it was credited to him for righteousness?”\nThis last question is incredibly significant for people seeking to be good Jews, to follow the law. It harkens back to their patriarch and his standing before God. In Genesis 15 God promises Abraham, an old man, an heir who will lead to offspring as numerous as the stars. Abraham believed this promise and it was “credited to him as righteousness”—that is, his faith was his righteousness in the eyes of God. Abraham, the father of God’s people, was justified by faith. The Galatians could not rest on their law-based laurels. A few years prior John the Baptist had warned about this very thing when he preached the coming of Jesus: “Do not presume to say to yourselves ‘We have Abraham as our father.” He then preaches repentance and the coming of Christ, the true messiah.\nWhat does all this add up to? We have a church inclined to seek justification through following the law. We see Paul point back to Abraham, their father figure, as justified by faith. We see John the Baptist dismiss justification by association with Abraham and point forward to Jesus.\nPaul ends this section with the clarifying, defining words: “those who have faith, these are Abraham’s sons.” He does not dismiss the significance of Abraham or God’s promise to him. No, he clarifies it. Abraham was promised to be the father of a great nation through whom all the nations of the world would be blessed (gentiles, like me and most of you). How does this happen? Through Jesus, the offspring of Abraham. We are made right in the eyes of God by faith in Jesus and no other way, no other action, no other law. So it is that faith folds us into the family of Abraham, the people of God.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

When the truth of this verse hits your heart, it’ll feel like you touched a live wire with 2,000 volts pumping through its coils. You’ll feel dead. And then you’ll feel alive. Our lives are no longer our own, brothers. Christ lives in us and works through us. He brings with Him life after death. That’s the way of the gospel.\nPaul reminds us of the time Peter struggled to walk in the freedom of the gospel. Christ’s cross and empty tomb finished the demands of the law. “For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes” (Romans 10:4). If the law were a subway, Christ is the final stop. Everyone off. If the law were a movie, Christ is the hero-scene. Roll the credits. With Christ, we’ve died to the law, and we now live with Christ.\nIf you are a Christian, your commitment to Him is more than merely believing that a man from Nazareth was crucified under Roman occupation. You were crucified, too, right along with Him. You are a crucified man. As Jesus struggled to breathe, your sins and your past life were struggling to breathe too. And when Christ walked out of that borrowed burial site, you walked out, too—into new life. Right now, your life is animated by the Lord Jesus. Christ lives in you, and you live by faith. Faith in Christ is now the driving force in your life, if only you’ll let Him lead.\nWhy did Christ do all of this for you? Because He knew you were going to be a great Christian? Ha! No, not at all. He knew you and I would be bumbling followers of The Way. Did He do all of this because our good works caught His attention? Nope. Paul is clear: Jesus loved us and gave Himself for us out of His great love for us (Ephesians 2:4–5). Jesus loves you, brothers. The Bible tells us so. Rejoice. Live freely in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ. That’s the Christian life.\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

Paul wasn’t going to let the church bullies in Galatia win. No way. Forget about it. Paul was riding this theological Harley to Galatia, ready to step up for the Galatian church. Christ’s church is too precious to let a distorted gospel run amok.\nBy this point in the letter, you are beginning to get a whiff of the garbage in Galatia. People are teaching that you have to be circumcised, in addition to faith in Jesus, if you want to be a real Christian. Paul brings up the fact that Titus, an uncircumcised Greek, was at his meeting with apostles in Jerusalem—mission control of the early church—and they didn’t make Titus get circumcised. So, why is that? Because it’s not vital to the gospel of grace.\nBut legalists will try and sneak in their lists of “do-this and don’t do that.” They want to enslave people, corrupting the freedom we have in Christ, and chaining them to their yokes and burdens. But Paul refuses to entertain it for even a minute. False gospels don’t get any courtesy. You must be swift to cut out any distortions of the gospel you see in your life. What do you think defines rightness before God other than the righteousness of Christ? The answer is nothing—not even reading your Bible every morning and going to church every Sunday.\nYes, we are called to read Scripture, to meditate on it day and night (Joshua 1:8) and to store it up in our hearts so that we might not sin against the God whom we love (Psalm 119:11, ESV). We are to feast on His words (Jeremiah 15:6) and delight in them (Psalm 1:2–3) because they teach us how to live best, but also because God’s Word invites us to know Him better. In Scripture we encounter Jesus and learn to follow Him as He transforms us into His image, making us more like Him.\nBut even spiritual disciplines, good things, like reading Scripture and serving do not make us right with God. His grace alone does that. As Dallas Willard said, “Grace is not opposed to effort, but to earning.” So let the real gospel out, share the truth with others, and it will defend against all its distortions. Today, may we rest in and run to our crucified and risen Savior.\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

Dr. James Naismith created a spectacle that still dazzles millions of people every year. While it’s been improved over time (the addition of the three-point shot, for example), the game originated with Dr. Naismith, a physical education teacher, his student athletes, and a peach basket hanging off a gymnasium balcony. It’s amazing what can come from human ingenuity; human beings can be quite clever.\nBut no human came up with the gospel. It’s too beautiful. It’s too “other than us” for one of our kind to have dreamed up the drama and goodness of redemption. The gospel came to us from another dimension, from heaven to earth. Holy became human; the Son of God became man. Learning to live out the gospel is to believe it. To trust it.\nPaul didn’t create this message to the church. He received it from God and then went on mission with Him to spread it all over the Roman world. And this is our task, too: to believe in the gospel—in Jesus, the one God sent to us (John 6:29)—and to share the good news with others, spreading its message far and wide beyond us. It won’t always be easy, but it will always be worth it.\nWhile false teachers pushed back against Paul’s message and his authenticity to even preach the gospel, Scripture shows us that he remains committed to sharing his testimony. Paul begins by reminding us that he isn’t an ordinary teacher; he’s a full-blooded apostle. Not ordained by men, not trained in some weekend program in a shopping mall—the risen Christ gave Paul this ministry. And his authority surpasses anyone who would disagree with him. Paul establishes his apostleship, not to puff out his chest, but to wrap his arms around us, as to say, “I’m here to help. I know what I’m talking about. Will you trust me?” A former Pharisee before Jesus flipped his world upside down in the very best way, Paul knows the power of Christ and is not ashamed of the gospel.\nHow has Jesus flipped your world around? Don’t ever be ashamed of your story. Jesus isn’t. He wrote it. He’s using it. Your personal narrative of new life doesn’t have a human origin either—it’s all grace. Praise God for it!

I put the name of the business in correctly, but it took me about ten blocks away—in the opposite direction from where I needed to go. I’ve since ditched Apple Maps, and I’ve been faithful to Google Maps ever since. We are right to ditch apps when they fail us. There are better options out there. But there are no better options when it comes to the gospel.\nPaul is amazed that the Galatians are turning from the pure gospel of Christ, turning from Jesus Himself, and turning to a “different gospel.” It’s not like Jesus led them astray. there’s no chance Jesus pointed them ten blocks in the opposite direction. He hadn’t failed them. So why were they installing a different gospel in their lives? Perhaps because they were deceived and pressured into buying into a gospel that’s really no gospel at all.\nHow often are you tempted to subscribe to a “gospel” that says you only matter to God if you prayed today? Or read your Bible? Do you follow the crushing logic of a “gospel” that ties your joy to your works, or do you tie it to Jesus’s cross and resurrection? If we aren’t careful, we can take good things, like spiritual disciplines, and we can make them into cursed things if we attach them to the gospel. Bible reading doesn’t level us up in God’s sight, no more than circumcision leveled up the Galatians. Distorted gospels are a dime a dozen.\nOne of the great weapons of legalists and pushy people in the Church is peer pressure. Most of us like being liked; we don’t want to make waves and offend others. But if this goes unchecked, it can lead to adopting all kinds of dangerous teachings. Paul tells that he isn’t trying to please people first and foremost. He’s Christ’s servant. He is committed to speaking the truth and guarding the good deposit of grace to the Galatians.\nIf you ever sense someone spreading a distorted gospel, remember who you live to please, first and foremost. Correct course in love. Correct course because it matters. And when possible, do no’t let others be led astray.\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

Galatians is a nuclear rod of grace. Whatever it touches is transforms, sets free, enlivens and revitalizes. The church in Galatia needed a reviving around the gospel of grace. Honestly, who doesn’t?\nPaul wrote this spicy letter to the Galatians because they were toying with the gospel. Because of false teachers in their community, the Galatians were about to tamper with the gospel of grace, diluting it by adding their own works. But we don’t make the gospel better by adding to it—that’s how to de-grace the gospel. Christ alone and none of our works makes us righteous before the Father. This is why Paul wrote to the Church, and this is what we still need to hear today on the regular.\nAs Paul gets off the starting block, he goes right into the full-flavored gospel. “Grace to you”—it’s not you climbing toward grace, reaching for it. Grace to you. Grace always runs downhill, meeting us right where we are. Only Jesus can deliver us from our sins—past, present, and future—and we cannot deliver ourselves and make our relationship with God right. Only Jesus can rescue us from this dark, post-Eden, pre-New Jerusalem age. Faith alone in Christ alone is the only way we are saved. Simple. Supernatural.\nRight now, in the heavenly places, the risen Christ lives for you. The Father raised the Son out of Joseph’s borrowed tomb, defeating the biggest threat in your life: death. Jesus cracked the jaws of death when His eyelids flung open that Sunday morning. Were any of our works present that first Easter? No. But our risen Savior was there, dying in our place.\nGrace alone. Grace always.\nAnd that leads us to say, “Glory to God alone!” As Paul says, “To him be glory forever and ever. Amen.” And that’s what the book of Galatians is all about: God alone gets the glory. We can’t smuggle in any works, impressiveness, or goodness along with God’s grace. It’s just grace. It’s just Jesus. He is more than enough. Glory to God.\nWritten by J.A.

But the battles were not ultimately about those places. We are like this. Our hearts are battlefields, but the aim of the devil’s warring isn’t ultimately about us. What is he after? God’s glory. It has always been this way (see Ezekiel 28).\nSo why are we who are flesh and blood in this fight? Because Scripture teaches us that we exist to glorify God and enjoy Him forever (1 Cor. 10:31, 1 John 1:3), and the devil wants more than anything to render us irrelevant when it comes to living this sort of life.\nHow does the devil go about this? There is an old Scottish proverb that says, “The Devil’s boots don’t creak.” The devil is subtle. Why? Because we don’t fight what we don’t notice. The Apostle Paul wants us to notice we are in a fight.\nThe devil’s tactic isn’t to block the glory we strive to give to God as much as it is to take from us the desire to give God glory in the first place. He does this not by turning our focus from God and onto himself, but by turning our focus from God and onto ourselves.\nWhat does it look like to live as men obsessed with our own glory? It can look like an obsession with our weight or appearance. It can look like pettiness because self-love makes contempt come easy. It can look like a critical spirit when we determine to find our worth in how we stack up against others. It can look like a drive to manipulate because we’re afraid of anything we can’t control. What would you add to this list?\nWhat are we to do about this?\nGod gives us everything we need for everything He has called us to do and be. He has equipped us with armor and with access to His presence. We cannot fight this battle without Biblical truth and prayer, but the good news of the gospel is that we have been given access to God’s Word and His throne of grace, before which even the most weary and defeated disciple can fall and find help.\nScripture tells us who we are when our faith is in Christ. We are redeemed by blood of Jesus. We are heirs of God’s kingdom. We are agents of redemption in this world. So may God, by the power of His spirit, uncover the lies we believe and the accusations we wilt under. May He show us the devil’s schemes at work in our lives. And may God be glorified in and through our lives.\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

I followed her lead and rolled my eyes. I know why she laughed. And she knew precisely why I rolled my eyes as I moved quickly away to my writing nook. \nThis series of passages often gets abused in the church. There isn’t really a better way to say it. In some cases, it has made tyrants out of men. We may read the entirety of Ephesians and come to a screeching halt at the words “submit” and “slave.” Sometimes when reading Scripture we are tempted to scrap the big picture for a small one. Today, let’s make sure we have the bigger picture in focus first.\nUp to this point, Paul has built a simple yet beautiful theology around the ascended Jesus. It is in the ascended Jesus that we find our truest identity. In other words, we see what it is to be fully human as God desires us to be fully human. We see our calling, our destiny, and our glory all summed up in the reality that Jesus is seated on the throne in heaven at the Father’s right hand (Revelation 3:21). A better way to say it is this: in Jesus, heaven and earth are in their fullness. \nThe problem is that we don’t see the ascended Lord. This reality is hidden from our eyes. It is hidden from the world’s eyes. So, as we remind ourselves of Christ’s prayer to the Father, we have that one little phrase, “on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10). \nHow will people know that Christ and the Father are one? How will they know the depths of that beautiful relationship? The Church, and how it manifests its life in the most basic of relationships, points us to the oneness of God the Father and the Son (Ephesians 1:22-23). Paul isn’t giving instructions to the Church so that its members will live out some strict moral code. No, Paul is instructing the Church how to embody, in the power of the Spirit, the marvelous relationship between the Father and the Son. He is inviting them into the divine life of the ascended Lord and to reveal that life to the world around them. \nEverything Paul asks of his hearers is rooted in the nature of Christ: Submit. Love. Obey. The ascended Lord is revealed to the world when we— all of us— submit ourselves to one another in Christ (Ephesians 5:21). \nThese texts are rich and beautiful. They take the most simple of relationships and form them into the light of Christ. In embracing their true meaning, we begin to get a glimpse into the Lord’s prayer for us: on earth as it is in heaven.\nwritten by Father Aaron Wright\n\n                ",

I have high cholesterol, so my doctor says, “Don’t eat ice cream!” But I love ice cream, and now that he’s told me “no,” I want it all the more. Like Paul says in Romans 7:15, “I do not understand what I am doing, because I do not practice what I want to do, but I do what I hate.”\nOur passage today takes us into the realm of dos and don’ts. Some think that’s all the Christian life is, and so they want nothing to do with it. After all, this list Paul gives the Ephesians is pretty overwhelming, even to the most disciplined believer.\nThankfully, Paul’s list does not stand alone but comes after Chapters 1-3, making it clear that dos and don’ts are not the heart of the gospel. In the Christian faith, the indicatives (what is true about me in Christ) always come before the imperatives (how we then live). I’ll explain what I mean.\nOn the way to school I often ask my 5-year-old and almost-3-year-old boys this question: “Boys, who do you belong to?” They’ve learned that the answer to this odd question is, “God, Mommy, and Daddy.” It’s not a control freak question, but rather one of identity. The point is, if we belong to the Henderson family, we should think, speak, and act in accord with the beliefs and traits of our family, never forgetting who we are. In the same way, if we belong to the family of God, we should act like children of God. Identity informs lifestyle.\nPaul has spent three chapters of his letter telling the church who they belong to. They—and we—are those for whom God moves heaven and earth to make them his children. His Son gave His life to save us. His Spirit lives within us as a seal of proof and a deposit, guaranteeing the promises to come. Chapter four begins a shift. Paul essentially says, If this is true about you, then live this way. It’s as if he’s asking us, “Children, who do you belong to?”\nScripture tells us there has been a shift in the heart of every follower in Christ from darkness to light (Ephesians 5:8), from pagan ways to the Christian lifestyle. This is not as a result of rules but out of joy for what Christ has done for us!\nIf my core identity is that I am a son of the living God, then I want to live that way. Being in Christ doesn’t guarantee my faithfulness—this world will bring challenges and temptations. But in Christ I am a new creation, and I can choose to live as a new creation. Yes, this will require a power outside of myself. But good news! His Spirit fills me, transforming me day by day and empowering me to live out my true identity in Christ.\nMay we not buy into the idea that the Christian life is a moral straitjacket, but live in the reality that it is a path of flourishing for all who find their identity in Christ.\nWritten by David Henderson\n\n                ",

Some would say Christian culture has emasculated men, leaving them weakened or tamed. Others might say the definition of a Christian man has been made so specific it alienates those with different giftings. Why such division? If we are brothers in Christ, why does our family seem so dysfunctional?\nIn this passage from Ephesians, Paul once again addresses unity in the midst of diversity,  urging believers to walk worthy of their calling in Christ. I don’t know about you, but I tend to have selective hearing. If you give me five compliments and one criticism, I seem to only hear the one criticism. Though Paul’s focus is a bit more instructional in this passage, we must be careful not to forget the context of grace that permeates his message, even when that message intersects the practical topic of our works.\nWith grace as the context, we are challenged to walk in and live out the calling we have received. Paul exhorts us to do this with all humility and patience, accepting one another in love, while diligently keeping the unity of the Spirit as the peace that binds us (Ephesians 4:1-2). Might Paul’s focus on humility and peace reflect our tendency toward comparison and competition over unity and acceptance?\nPaul goes on to list several gifts and roles within the body of believers, stating the purpose of the various gifts is “to build up the body of Christ, until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God’s Son, growing into a mature man with a stature measured by Christ’s fullness” (Ephesians 4:12-13). When we do not live in the unity of the Spirit, we corrupt our gifts of ministry into idols of competition.\nCompetition strips the body of Christ of peace and unity. We will not be vulnerable, open, and honest if we feel like we have to earn our place of significance. At the same time, we should not deny our gifts or act as if everyone is created with the same gifts. God has displayed Himself uniquely in us all. We are all His poiēma (Ephesians 2:10), yet we are not all duplicates. We are created to fit together to accomplish what He has called and prepared for us to do.\nGod gives us each talents, abilities, and perspective. If we are to live out God’s call in the culture He has placed us in, then each talent, ability, and perspective is valuable, not just those that are the loudest or strongest.\nTo restore function to our dysfunctional family of faith, we must embrace the unity of the body of Christ that Paul preached to the Ephesians. To restore a healthy view of true Christian masculinity, we must stop competing and comparing, focusing on the Kingdom instead of on ourselves.\nWe are called to more, and in the unity of the Spirit, by the grace of Christ Jesus, we will achieve it.\nWritten by Britton Sharp\n\n                ",

How many wars have been fought, refugees created, and lives degraded because of the love of power? And how many offenses have been forgiven, orphans adopted, outsiders welcomed in, and lives transformed because of the power of love? \nWhat happens when these two forces cease the back and forth we’re used to and come together in embrace? What would that look like? What would be the effect in our world and in our lives?\nIn God the Father, love and power are perfectly mingled together. Paul’s prayer for the Ephesian church is that they would understand and live from the depth of the Father’s love for them, namely that love as found in Christ Himself.\nThe language we get here is both agricultural and architectural. Paul’s desire is for these Ephesian believers to be rooted and established in love. The first metaphor elicits a picture of a tree sending roots deep into the soil and drawing upon its rich nutrients, as we are to put deep roots in Christ, being nourished by His constant flow of love. The second metaphor paints the picture of building a structure on a solid foundation, just as we are to build our lives on the unshakeable foundation of the love of Christ. This rootedness and grounding is the result of Christ dwelling in our hearts by the power of the Holy Spirit.\nPower and strength are both mentioned twice in this passage. As followers of Christ, we are not only grounded in Christ’s love for us, but we are empowered to understand the magnitude of this reality and to let His love permeate and energize our lives. Paradoxically, we are to “know the love of Christ” that “surpasses knowledge” (v. 19). We are to know the unknowable. This speaks to the incredible depth and breadth of Christ’s love for us, such that we have to authentically experience it to understand it. This is no mere head knowledge, but interactive relationship with the One who demonstrated His love for us by giving up power and dying on the cross.\nThere is a goal, an end to which Paul is praying: that we would be filled with all the fullness of God. As followers of Jesus, our lives are to burn and brim with the power and love of God. Indeed, power and love have come together in embrace in Christ and His finished work of the cross, and the sons of God in Christ are enveloped in it.\nMay the power and love of God take shape in our lives as we are firmly established in Christ’s love.\nwritten by Chris Comstock\n\n                ",

I know this takes place when we say the Nicene Creed every Sunday. We say something so many times (which is a wonderful practice) that we can forget what it is we are actually confessing. One of those parts that we tend to say without fully grasping the reality of it is the part about Jesus ascending. The Creed states, “He ascended into Heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.”\nYou just read one of the thickest, richest portions of Holy Scripture you will ever read.  However, it can be easy to miss; not because it is hiding from us, but because we typically don’t bring the right kind of lens to the reading. We don’t read it through the lens of the Ascended Lord. We have typically narrowed the Gospel message to crucifixion and resurrection. Crucifixion reveals and deals with our sin. Resurrection gives us victory over it.  But ascension shows us where we belong, who we are called to be, what God’s plan has been all along. God and man were meant to dwell together. Christ is still human and divine. He is in the throne room with God.  \nTo read Ephesians without the Ascension front and center is to miss Ephesians altogether. Look how Paul has set this up: read Ephesians 1:9-12, 1:20-23, and 2:6-10. God’s plan is to make us co-heirs with Christ, who is seated above all things, and for us to be seated with Him. Christ has made a way for humanity and God to dwell together because He is fully human and has the authority in Heaven to gather all things into Himself.  \nIt is for this reason that Paul has become a prisoner. What Paul has discovered through the Holy Spirit is that Christ holds all of humanity within Himself. Not only Jew, but also Gentile. So through Jesus—the ascended, human Jesus— we have been brought near to God if we are in Him. And we have become members of His body— His Ascended Body. This is not some ethereal reality, this is tangible. We are Christ’s body and Christ’s body is ascended. So, when Paul comes to the end of this portion of Scripture, he reminds us that God’s eternal purpose has been carried out in Christ Jesus. Now we have access to God in boldness and confidence through the faithfulness of Christ.  \nAs you go about your day, thankful for the crucifixion and resurrection, remember that you have already been brought near to God through Christ. The Ascended Lord has gathered you up in His body, the Church, and is already giving you a foretaste of the heavenly life.\nwritten by Father Aaron Wright\n\n                ",

Tension, war, division, oppression, suffering— they overwhelm us, and the combination can overshadow our lives and our faith.  \nThe Ephesians knew this tension too. Paul’s letter was written to be circulated among small groups of believers scattered throughout what is now modern-day Turkey. It was a culturally diverse area, and the tensions that came with this inherent diversity may have easily overshadowed the small churches there.\nYesterday, we read that we are God’s workmanship, His poiēma. Lest we be too individualistic, in today’s reading, Paul calls us back to the reality of the body of Christ. We are different, but we are one.\nPaul draws out two key factors of this unity.\n\n Christ brings peace where there was division. \n\nIn verse 13, he states, “But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah.” “Messiah” was a Jewish term; however, Paul was writing to an ethnically mixed audience of both Jews and Gentiles. He points out that Christ Jesus brings the two together. Not only this, in the following verse he says that Christ is our peace and has torn down the walls of hostility (Ephesians 2:14). We are not called to be homogenous, we are called to peace—peace made possible in Christ.\nThis is a daunting task, but God always provides where He has called. In verse 18, we see the unifying power and work of the Spirit. In the magnitude of the gospel, differing cultures and ethnicities are made fellow citizens by the unifying and redeeming work of Christ Jesus. Unity comes by His provision, but it is also part of His provision. We need the body of Christ to fulfill the call of Christ.\n\n Christ is our cornerstone. \n\nPaul then illustrates that each of us, as God’s workmanship, is part of the grander work of the Kingdom. Christ Jesus is the cornerstone on which this work is built. \nThe gospel is about the redemption of all things in Christ. Our personal salvation is a critical part of this great work, but not the only part. The gospel is much bigger than us— it’s about all things being reconciled in Christ. As believers we are “being built together for God’s dwelling place in the Spirit” (Ephesians 2:21).\nWe are all made one to glorify the One who redeems and reconciles us, who has crafted us into His workmanship. May we strive towards this unity, for in it we find the provision to live as God has called us.\nwritten by Britton Sharp\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I was going to start this by saying, “We tend to forget where we came from…” But, if I am being candid, I don’t forget it— I would just rather ignore it. \nEphesus was a booming city and commercial crossroads (think: the culture of New York or LA), and the Ephesian church contained a lot of diversity. The stories of the believers there were must have been a vast array of redemption at work, a passing from death to life. Yet, I wonder if at times they, too, ignored their past. Personally, often due to shame, I don’t always want to remember that I was dead in my sin. God’s mercy is rich, and so often I long to share it with others— yet, at the same time, I want to deny the reality of my bankruptcy. We love to give, but there is often an unhealthy shame in needing to receive.\nMaybe the Ephesians thought the teaching of the gospel was juvenile and they had moved on to grander theological debates. Or, perhaps they became distracted, the beauty and tangibility of the city enticing them away from the gospel that changed them.\nIt’s been said that early in life we are astronauts, looking to the stars and endless possibilities. But as we age, we become archeologists, looking for the significance and meaning of what has already happened. As believers, we are called to embrace both. We must be willing to acknowledge our need for the gospel in our past, while also following it in our future.\nEphesians 2:10 is one of my all-time favorite verses. It says: “For we are His creation (poiēma in Greek), created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time so that we should walk in them” (HCSB).\nThe word poiēma is rich with meaning. It is can be translated “handiwork,” “masterpiece,” “workmanship,” and “creature.” It is a deep word, suggesting more than just an impulse or whim, but something created with meaning, purpose, and intent.\nWhen you look at a piece of art, you don’t just look at one part of it—the background, for example. You see how the whole of the piece works together. We must balance seeing our past with seeing our purposeful hope of the future. If we only focus on our past, we could struggle with shame; if we only focus on our future, we may find ourselves alienated and unrelatable. To focus on one aspect only is to miss the composition of redemptive grace in the entire piece.\nLest we become puffed up, Paul reminds us that we are God’s creation and nothing good is of our own doing. Our God-given purpose is to do good works, that He has prepared beforehand. This is a mic drop moment if you get the fullness of it.\nYou are created to do God’s good works that He has prepared beforehand, that you should walk in them.\nEvery step you will take for the rest of your life, God has gone before you and prepared the way. The rest of your life, then, is choosing whether to walk in His ways and provision or to try your own way.\nMay we live in the reality that we are His poiēma, displaying the gospel to the world around us.\nwritten by Britton Sharp\n\n                ",

Though close in proximity, head knowledge and heart knowledge can stand miles apart. \nHosea 6:3 says, “Let us know; let us press on to know the Lord.” But what is knowing? On one hand, it simply means gathering data, like this: My name is David, I am six feet tall, I have hazel eyes and brown hair. Now you know me. Google and smartphone apps allow us to know almost anything within seconds.\nBut it is a vastly different sense in which I know my wife. I know what she looks like, but I also know what she likes and dislikes, what she needs and doesn’t need. I know her personality type—how it meshes with my own and how our differences sometimes bring us into conflict. I know what makes her feel happy and loved, fearful and ashamed. I know what brings her life.  I know her spiritually—why she loves Jesus and how she engages with Him. I know her physically, even intimately.\nI have a deep relationship with my wife. I truly know her. I know her in many ways that I do not know, nor care to know, the celebrity on my television screen. I know about celebrities, but I know my wife.\nThis is the sense in which the word “know” is used in the Bible. It is not mere knowledge about something. It is intimate, relational knowledge.\nPaul has just finished telling the Christians in Ephesus about all the spiritual blessings they have in Christ Jesus. They know it. And they are living it out through “faith in the Lord Jesus and love toward all the saints” (Ephesians 1:15). They get it, but they don’t. And neither do we. It is the Ephesian church that Jesus Himself will rebuke in Revelation 2:4: “But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first.” How could a group of people get it but not get it, know it but not know it? Because all too often head knowledge trumps heart intimacy.\nWe know random details about every friend on Instagram, but we know few, if any, of those friends on a heart level. We know theology but not the “theos” Himself. We know Scripture but not the God of Scripture intimately.\nWhat is the cure for this heart forgetfulness? Paul prays. He seeks the Lord, praying for a heart enlightenment. He prays for knowledge of Him who gives us hope in despair, whose salvation is sure. He prays that we would know we are His treasure. He prays for knowledge of Him whose resurrection power works in us to transform us into the image of His Son.\nWhen we are adopted by the Father through the Son, God gives us a new identity. He gives us hope, and empowers us with His very own Spirit. If we know this within our hearts, it will change our lives. Pressing on to know this God of immeasurable greatness is our life’s goal.\nwritten by David Henderson\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The letter from the Apostle Paul to the Ephesians opens with a command: Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. \nWhy? That question is what the rest of the letter endeavors to solve. But Paul summarizes the answer in verse 3: praise God because He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavens.\nHere’s the thing: if God hasn’t blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing, then both the teachings of the rest of this letter and their applications are out of our reach. We may as well put the letter away. But what Paul says in this first verse is that, when our faith is in Christ, the riches of life in Christ are ours. \nThe problem is that we often still live as spiritual paupers. Why do we do this? One reason is because we often do not understand the foundation under such a promise. So Paul opens this letter by pouring some heavy theological footings on which our hope in Christ stands. How heavy? Let’s look.\n1. God chooses man.  Paul says in vs. 4 “He chose us,” and in vs 5, “He predestined us.” Throughout Scripture, you see God choosing people—Abraham, Isaac, Jacob (Israel), and Joseph. Moses. David. Jesus chose his apostles, even Paul. Though we, from our earthbound perspective, struggle to understand reality, Jesus taught, “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him” (John 6:44).\n2. God’s redemption is accomplished by the unmerited grace of Jesus. God’s choosing His people is neither deserved nor earned by those He has chosen. The basis of our salvation is “in Christ” (Ephesians 1:3-9). Salvation, from beginning to end, is an act of God’s undeserved grace.\n3. God calls His people into a relationship with Him that is intimate. Why does God call His people? Are we just His worker bees? No, God chooses His people so they might spend eternity in intimate proximity with Him. “He predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ” (Ephesians 1:5).\nWhen we put these opening verses together, what do we get? God chose His people before the foundation of the world, according to His mercy and grace and not by any work of our own, in order that we might know Him as our Father, and know ourselves as His beloved children.\nThis, Paul says, should draw from us a response of praise. Why? Because a great darkness has been pushed back. The breathtaking beauty of God choosing us in Him before the foundation of the world to be His adopted children is that, had He not, ours would only be a story of perishing in the wreckage of our sin. But praise be to God: He has intervened. God doesn’t rescue us to give us a second chance. He saves us from spiritual death and then gives us a new identity as His adopted sons.\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Who am I and what in the world am I doing? \nIt’s a question that usually arises in transition or other uncertain circumstances. However, if you lived in a city like Ephesus, it might be a daily recurrence. Ephesus was a port city of many cultures and, therefore, many religions and worldviews. Some of them dominated the cultural landscape. For example, worship of the Roman goddess Diana (equivalent to the Greek goddess Artemis) was so prevalent that there was a massive temple built in her honor, one of the largest temples in the world. The temple was so successful and rich it also operated as a bank that gave out loans to entire countries. People took pilgrimages to this temple and took home a small silver figurine as a souvenir, like the Eiffel tower figurine you might get if you went to Paris today. \nThese silversmiths that made these souvenirs as well as offerings for the goddess herself are the same ones we read of in Acts 19:23-41. People were turning away from the worship of idols and the temple, and their business suffered. They held Paul responsible. He was preaching not just another god to add to their collection, but the God—not just any gospel, but the gospel. This new perspective threatened their livelihood, and they didn’t like it. \nSometimes what we believe will inconvenience and cause friction with the world around us. How does God provide for this? How do we live with this tension and friction? What must we not lose hold of in the midst of it?\nThese are the questions that Paul answers for the churches in the region of Ephesus. This letter was passed around to the house churches, helping them remember who they were in Christ amid a culture that believed otherwise. Paul also points out that, even though the members of the church come from different cultures, through Christ they are made one. He instructs them about how this unity will be their lifeline as they strive to walk with God in the midst of the tension. \nAbove all, Paul encouraged the Ephesians to walk in the new life they’ve been given in Christ Jesus—a life of fullness, love, and unity.\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When I was a freshman in college, the Lord used a series of events to bring me to my knees before Him. I had been a Christian for a few years at that point, but it’s fair to say I hadn’t truly made God the true “Lord of my life.” What I mean is, I believed in my heart and my head that the work of Christ saved me from my sin into eternal life with God, but this belief hadn’t yet changed my affections and motivations.\nIn short, I was pursuing a relationship with a girl, and through one of my attempts to communicate my commitment to that girl, I lost her trust and the relationship of a dear friend in the process. I was not content with the love of Christ; I needed the love and attention of someone else. The Lord showed me my sin. I was searching for contentment in others, but true contentment can only be found in Him. When I came to understand this—really understand it in my heart—I found myself being drawn closer to God.\nThroughout his ministry, Paul found himself in much more dire circumstances than losing the attention of a girl he liked. He faced countless acts of persecution and attempted execution. He was shipwrecked. He was bitten by a snake. He was imprisoned. Despite all of that, Paul is able to write: “I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I find myself” (Philippians 4:11).\nNow, it’s important to remember that Paul was not given some sort of enhanced version of the Holy Spirit in order to face all the difficult situations he faced in his life. Paul received the same Holy Spirit Christians receive today when they repent and believe that Christ has saved them from their sins. Paul is not some sort of super-Christian, allowing him to be content amidst trials in a way that we cannot match. But Paul does say something curious in verse 12: “In any and all circumstances I have learned the secret of being content​—whether well fed or hungry, whether in abundance or in need.”\nWe may be tempted to think, Uh-huh. See! God has given Paul something “extra.” He’s told him some “secret” that He hasn’t shared with us—that’s the real reason he’s able to be content in all things. We may be tempted to believe true contentment is impossible, that there’s a “secret something” we need to get or earn or do to be at peace. But that’s just not the case. In verse 13, Paul lays it out plainly: “I am able to do all things through him who strengthens me.”\nThat’s. It. That’s the secret.\nThe secret to living with true contentment is that we are given the ability to do so by His Spirit. Verse 13 is not a promise from God that we will somehow be able to conquer any mountain or accomplish any task we want just because we are Christians. When we read within the context of the rest of Paul’s letter to the Philippians, we see that verse 13 reveals the secret to living a life of contentment no matter what our circumstances are. God wants us to find our contentment in Him because He knows we cannot find true contentment anywhere else.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Depression and anxiety have never been as prevalent in the United States as they are today. These twin burdens often afflict the same people, and they are afflicting more Americans than they ever have before. This is especially true among young people. From the 1990s to the early 2000s, rates of depression and anxiety were pretty stable. That isn’t the case anymore.\nAccording to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, in 2012, about 5% of boys and about 12% of girls ages twelve to seventeen had a “major depressive episode” in the preceding year. In 2016, about 7% of boys and about 20% of girls had a major depressive episode—that is one in five American teenage girls having a major depressive episode. We are amidst an epidemic, and there are plenty of purported reasons why, but that’s for another place and another time. The point is this: As a culture, we are more anxious and depressed than we have ever been.\nI have battled with serious feelings of anxiety myself. It can feel like a hole out of which it is impossible to climb. And while I don’t imagine the apostle Paul knew about the depression epidemic Americans would face in the 21st century, his words to us in Philippians 4 may serve us well as we fight the realities of our mental health struggles.\nRejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: \nRejoice! Let your graciousness be known to everyone. \nThe Lord is near. Don’t worry about anything, but in everything, \nthrough prayer and petition with thanksgiving, \npresent your requests to God (Philippians 4:4–6).\nLet me be clear in saying this: the depression and anxiety we feel may not be simply solved by reading our Bibles and being encouraged to throw off anxiety and “rejoice!” It can be hard to find joy when the world feels like it’s closing in, and in a moment of distress, a few Bible verses may not immediately quell our feelings of helplessness. However, I do think it is important to read Paul’s words closely and examine our lives in light of them. I actually find it helpful to read these particular verses in reverse order. For our purposes today, consider this slight rearrangement:\nThe Lord is near. Don’t worry about anything, \nbut in everything, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, \npresent your requests to God…\nRejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: \nRejoice! Let your graciousness be known to everyone.\nI must confess, there have been times when I’ve found myself rolling my eyes after reading Paul’s instruction to not worry. It feels as though there is no way Paul could understand what is causing my distress, so his charge to not worry feels invalid (though he was well acquainted with having to live life from a cell). But the reasoning he gives for why we should not worry is there alongside his charge to not do so. Why should we not worry? Because the Lord is near! This is a tremendous truth, a more than adequate remedy for whatever worry we may be facing.\nWhen we are fighting any variety of anxiety and worry in our lives, we ought to ask ourselves: Do I truly believe Jesus is near? Or do I feel like I’m in a forever-deep hole by myself? Might we find peace even in our anxiety if we realized our Lord is truly by our side at all times and in all places? May He help us to believe what is always true: the Lord is near.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Prior to 1929, there was no standard oath to recite when someone became a citizen of the United States. As you might imagine, this reality allowed for the naturalization process to vary from state to state. But in 1929, that reality changed when the U.S. Citizenship Oath took on standardized language. About twenty years later (1952), amendments were made to emphasize service to the country. Those changes included adding language around bearing arms on behalf of the United States when required, and performing noncombatant services in the armed forces when deemed necessary. The time frame (1950s) for all this is of importance. Think about it: this was the onset of the Cold War, and the stakes—both real and perceived—were at a tension-filled high.\nThe amended form of the Citizenship Oath still stands today, and it begins: “I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen…” Words matter. And if you’re going to be a citizen of the United States, it seems your allegiance does as well. You’ve got to be all in. You’ve got to stand firm. Of course, the “foreign” powers being referenced in the oath are earthly kingdoms and countries. But what if, for example, your truest citizenship is in heaven? (Philippians 3:20).\nThe New Testament is abundantly clear on this matter. If I have chosen allegiance to the cross of Christ, then my citizenship lies with His kingdom. While I may still be a citizen of this or that country, nation, or even of this world, things have changed. I live for and serve only One, even as I live as a citizen of my earthly country. To be a follower of Jesus means being all in. Sure, I am to render to Caesar what is Caesar’s (Mark 12:17), but I am also to render to God what is God’s—and God demands all of me.\nThe language the apostle Paul uses indicates that waffling in my allegiance to Christ equates to being a “enemy of the cross.” That’s rather harsh, isn’t it? But you see, far from some war between rival countries, you and I live in enemy territory, in a daily struggle for our hearts and minds. This calls for standing firm in the Lord each day, living acutely aware of “those who cause dissensions, for such people do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites. They deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting with smooth talk and flattering words.”\nWords matter. And if we claim to be Christians, those whose citizenship is in heaven, then that should be abundantly clear to anyone paying attention. Everything has changed, and we now live in such a way “that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified.” Our allegiance is to One, and to Him only.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

I’ll bet you’ve heard her name, and there’s a chance you’ve read her best-selling book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Maybe you’ve even seen her Netflix series, Tidying Up with Marie Kondo. In both, Kondo preaches the gospel of “KonMari”—a system of simplifying and organizing your home by getting rid of physical items that do not “bring joy” into your life. If you’ve no clue about her name, her book, her TV show, or her system, here’s my simplified overview: You stand in front of the clothes in your closet, go hanger by hanger, and ask if that garment brings you joy. If the garment or item does not, then discard it, but only after you’ve thanked those bell bottoms, for example, for their service.\nCall me cynical, but I find that to be a bit extreme. I’m also envious that Kondo has, at last count, four bestselling books on organizing your life her way. Some ideas come along at the right time, and hers have definitely struck a chord with millions of people, helping them to get their ducks, or closets, in a row. But Kondo’s idea is not original. See Paul’s words to the Philippians:\nForgetting what is behind and reaching forward to what is ahead, \nI pursue as my goal the prize promised by \nGod’s heavenly call in Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:13–14).\nThe apostle Paul’s approach to spiritual life is by no means the same as Marie Kondo’s approach to your closet. But in some ways, they share the same ballpark, for Paul also advocates for a ruthless elimination of anything in our lives, especially anything in our past, that hinders us from true joy—otherwise known as “knowing Christ Jesus.” Discipline and self-control are non-negotiables in this way of living. In fact, Paul invokes imagery of elite athletes such as boxers and runners in training who strive for nothing less than a win. And Paul’s training advice to us? “Run in such a way to win the prize” (1 Corinthians 9:24).\nLike Kondo, Paul has his critics, those who insist such an approach is too extreme. But Paul remains adamant, stressing that those who practice such devotion and commitment experience nothing short of life-changing transformation, an experience that leads to a crown that will never fade away (1 Corinthians 9:25). If there’s anything “behind” us in our lives that does not orient us to the joy of knowing Jesus Christ, then those things are to be forgotten, done away with. This “tidying up,” so to speak, allows us to then be free to reach for and live for God’s goal that lies ahead. No, this has nothing to do with closets and hangers and bell bottoms, but everything to do with our hearts and minds and souls and strength.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    A dear friend recently suffered an enormous loss. His home and all of his family’s belongings were lost in a devastating home fire. In just a few hours, the historic home in which his family had invested years of renovation ended up as a pile of cinders and ash. This included all their clothes and family photos—virtually all of their earthly possessions. In the midst of this tragedy, one of the first things I wondered about was the quality of my friend’s homeowner’s insurance policy. It’s not that I was unconcerned about his family’s safety and their emotional loss, but as one who is predisposed to finding hope and safety in financial stability, the first thought that jumped to my mind was, Are they completely protected from all this suffering and loss?\nI am convinced that many of us wonder about God’s faithfulness, goodness, and love toward us, not because He has been unfaithful, but rather because we believe He has not lived up to providing the safe and prosperous outcomes we’ve imagined for our lives, such as our individual and cultural notions of safety, predictability and peace, pleasure and affluence. I wonder if our forebears from past generations bought into this idea, if they believed that those who follow Christ should expect a life free from insecurity, suffering, and loss.\nIn Philippians, Paul explains his reorientation from the false securities of his previous life to a new understanding in which he rejects those former notions in order that he “may gain Christ and be found in him” (Philippians 3:8–9). Now, because of Christ, he has suffered the loss of these accomplishments, and he even considers them “as dung” (v.8). This is one of many passages in the Bible that reminds us that God is not necessarily working to bring about our own individual dreams of the good life. If we don’t recognize this, we are likely to find ourselves primed for disappointment with God. He is concerned with something of much greater value than helping us achieve everything we want. His desire is for all of creation to experience the redemption and restoration we need.\nPaul knows that his former aspirations are nothing compared to gaining a relationship with Christ and being found in Him. As we consider our own privileges and accomplishments in comparison to the incomparable gift of knowing Jesus Christ, we will see the former things as far less important. We can appreciate them even as we count them as loss in comparison to the value of knowing Christ. Is the loss of these identity markers a true loss of identity? No. Our truest identity and a fuller comprehension of His redemptive love are found in our union with Christ. Only through Him are we truly secure.\nWritten by Rob Wheeler\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I recently heard a ministry leader share this idea: The first thing pastors lose after entering into the ministry is someone who will pastor them. In other words, you become the shoulder for other people to lean on, while missing out on having someone to lean on yourself. He then went on to mention the spiritual attacks pastors and their families often endure—the enemy’s attempts to knock them down and prevent the gospel message from spreading.\nAs Christians, we all face spiritual struggles, and sometimes isolation, because of our faith. Even Jesus said that we would be hated by the world because we are not of it (John 17:14–16). Our shared calling as believers is one of consistently serving others and sharing their burdens—a burden all its own that is not to be taken lightly, especially for those who are called to teach (James 3:1).\nDuring Paul’s ministry, he traveled across the Mediterranean preaching and then being thrown in prison. But he rarely endured this alone; Paul was constantly in the company of fellow believers who were also doing God’s work, working alongside him to spread the good news about Jesus.\nTwo of these assistants were Timothy and Epaphroditus. Paul mentions these men in a few of his letters, especially when he was sending one or both on a mission to a local church. He likens Epaphroditus to “his brother,” and urges the Philippian church to “welcome him in the Lord with great joy and hold people like him in honor” (Philippians 2:25, 29). He extols Timothy’s likemindedness and his “proven character” as he carries out his mission (Philippians 2:20, 22; 1 Corinthians 16:10). Clearly, Paul wanted those who would receive his brothers in the faith to treat Timothy and Epaphroditus with care and respect.\nIn Paul’s day, the missionaries spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ depended upon local churches for a lot. As they traveled, Paul, Timothy, and Epaphroditus relied on other believers to provide them food and shelter. They existed on God’s charity and the goodwill administered to them through the kindness of other believers. And although Paul could not always be with his brothers on mission, he wanted them to be held in high regard “because of their work” for the kingdom (1 Thessalonians 5:12–13).\nThis missional work was difficult, but men like Paul, Timothy, and Epaphroditus persevered because they were serving a God who loved them and a community of people who supported them. Likewise, each of us needs the Church, the body of Christ and all its parts working together, to carry out the call God has placed on our lives (1 Corinthians 12:12–14). The world has changed a lot since the first century, but the Great Commission hasn’t. So, while our challenges are different than those faced by Paul and his friends, we still need the grace of God—and one another.\nWritten by Robert Carnes\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    A few years ago, when I was working for a different organization, a colleague asked me for the email of a vendor we’d been working with. At the time, I’d been having difficulty getting said vendor to respond to my own messages, so in my return message to my colleague, I said something to effect of: “Good luck with getting in touch with him. He takes forever to respond.” I hit send and went about my business.\nA few minutes later, the color drained from my face when I got a response to my email—not from my colleague but from the vendor I’d been talking about. It seems that in my search for the vendor’s email address, I’d inadvertently sent my message to him instead of the colleague I’d meant to share it with. Of course, I profusely apologized to the vendor for my mistake, and thankfully, he was understanding, perhaps because what I’d said about his response time wasn’t untrue. Needless to say, this was a humbling moment for me professionally; I’d made a mistake which could have cost me a relationship. I also learned a valuable lesson about patience and proofreading emails before sending.\nIt’s no surprise that the word humble comes from the same Latin root, humilitas, which means “to be brought to a low place.” This can be done one of two ways: either voluntarily through our own actions and disposition, or through circumstances we experience. Humility is mentioned repeatedly throughout Scripture. The apostle Paul reminds us to be “humble and gentle” (Ephesians 4:2), while James says, “Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you” (James 4:10). And when Jesus visits a Pharisee’s house, He tells those proud men a parable about choosing seats at a wedding feast. The moral of the story is this: “Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted” (Luke 14:11).\nWhy is it so important for us to be humble? What’s the benefit of lowering ourselves? Christ was the greatest among us, yet He was also the most humble of all (Philippians 2:8). Why is humility the model Jesus set for us to follow? Because when you love others more than yourself, it makes for a better community. Acting selfishly benefits only yourself, but acting selflessly benefits everyone around you (v.3). When you lower yourself, you lift up everyone around you.\nWhen we focus more on other people, we also gain a perspective of empathy. Being humble opens our eyes to the needs and cares of those around us. God calls us to live in community with one another and support our fellow man. That’s much easier to do when we’re not distracted by our own ego.\nIt’s been said that “humility is not thinking less of yourself; it’s thinking of yourself less.” That statement has been attributed to several different Christian thinkers, including C.S. Lewis. Regardless, I imagine that whoever first said those words wouldn’t mind sharing credit—they no doubt understand the point of being humble.\nWritten by Robert Carnes\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In the book of Ecclesiastes, the Teacher (most likely King Solomon) wrote, “It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, since that is the end of all mankind, and the living should take it to heart” (Ecclesiastes 7:2). Except for the generation still alive when Christ returns, every person’s journey will end at the same place: death. The color will pass from our cheeks, and our limbs will make their final movements. The synapses that fire in our brains will ignite no longer, and our hearts will cease their steady rhythm. This life will be over.\nSince the moment when our first parents sinned in the garden, death has been our common enemy. He stalks each of us, no matter where we go. He’s unrelenting, never growing tired, never losing his pace. He is coming, and we cannot escape him. But in the book of Philippians, death is no longer fearsome. He doesn’t even look scary. Paul talks about dying as if it were just a change of location, no different than moving across town: “Now if I live on in the flesh, this means fruitful work for me; and I don’t know which one I should choose. I am torn between the two. I long to depart and be with Christ—which is far better—but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake” (Philippians 1:22–24). You can almost hear him weighing the difference between life and death the way one considers items on a dinner menu.\nThe gospel has freed Paul from the tyranny of death’s pursuit. The apostle is no longer running. Death has lost its power over him. He knows where he will go when his heart stops beating. He will find himself in the presence of the Lord, where there is abundant joy (2 Corinthians 5:8; Psalm 16:11). In the same way that the gospel has transformed the meaning of death, it has also transformed the meaning of life. Our time in this world can no longer be about mere pleasure or self-preservation. Against the backdrop of eternity, it is instead an opportunity to allow Christ to live in and through us, to worship Him and to serve others in His name.\nDeath is still our great enemy. It’s still appropriate to mourn when a loved one dies. We should still fight for life in every arena. And it is still a tragedy when an innocent life is cut short. Nothing in the gospel would deny any of that. But death is coming undone, and we who know Christ have no need to fear it.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In my life there have been people who have loved me, and there have been people who have loved me so well that they actually changed my life. I think of my sister, who gave me a place to stay when I had nowhere else to go. I think of a certain college professor whose teaching made the scriptures come alive for me in a way they simply hadn’t before. I think of friends who have given words to feelings for which I lacked the vocabulary. And I think of my wife, Laurin, whose tenderness in the midst of my sometimes misguided determination keeps me sane and holds our family together.\nSo, I have a sense of what Paul meant when he wrote, “I give thanks to my God for every remembrance of you” (Philippians 1:3). The Philippians had loved Paul well. They had shared their lives with him and given him a base of operations in Macedonia for his evangelistic work (Acts 16:15). They had supported him financially in good times and in bad (Philippians 4:14–16). And they had been partners in his mission to preach the gospel near and far (Philippians 1:5). Even in his imprisonment, their friendship had been an encouragement, bringing him joy in what was surely a time of suffering and loss.\nPaul’s gratitude is directed toward the Philippians, but it is also pointed at heaven, to the “God from whom all blessings flow,” as the Doxology says, echoing Jesus’s half-brother James: “Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights” (James 1:17). And Paul acknowledges this truth in his thanksgiving. He knows that the gifts he has received from his friends in Philippi—as well as the Philippians themselves—have been given to him from the hand of the Father.\nI thank God for bringing certain people into my life. Their impact has been so great that my mind can’t bear the thought that we crossed paths by accident. My story is being written by the Author of life itself, and these chapters were meant to be written. I didn’t see them coming. I didn’t plan them. In many cases, I didn’t even know I needed them. But God did. So I am thankful, each and every time I remember one of these who has loved me so well.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    As I write this, the current price of a U.S. postage stamp is fifty-five cents. That means, essentially, if I give my mail carrier two quarters and a nickel, he’ll make sure a letter I’ve written gets to my friend on the other side of the country. Even to Alaska. Even to a house in a remote part of the state. Even if the house is on the tippy-top of a very tall mountain. Even during a snowstorm. That makes sending a letter one of the greatest bargains going today.\nIt’s not just the small cost that makes sending or receiving a letter wonderful. A handwritten letter communicates something that an email or an Instagram DM or a phone call cannot. (Remember phone calls?) A letter is personal, not just because of the words written, but because of how they’re written: in the sender’s unique handwriting. A letter also takes time and more effort than other, more modern forms of sending a message, and that says something in and of itself.\nJust think about the last time you received an honest-to-goodness letter in the mail—not a bill or a package from Amazon or an account statement, but an actual letter from a friend. Didn’t it feel, well, special? Much more valuable than two quarters and a nickel, anyway.\nPaul’s letter to the Christians at Philippi was special, the nearest thing to being there in person. He couldn’t be there, of course, because he was in prison. But he wanted to impart something to his faithful friends, those who had become partners in the gospel (Philippians 1:5). Philippians is essentially a thank-you note for financial support. The theme is joy, and the tone is one of gratitude—to the recipients but also to God. In fact, if Paul had decided not to mention his current imprisonment in the letter itself, it would be hard for us as modern readers to deduce that reality on our own. This is simply not the sort of letter one would think emanated from the heart of an innocent man living under the weight of suffering.\nBut here it is, all the same.\nPhilippians is powerful, because it is an artifact of something nearly too good to be true. In the kingdom of God, the meek inherit the earth, the poor are blessed beyond measure, and those in prison find reason to sing. So, when Paul writes “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (Philippians 1:2), it’s not merely a formality. He knows the reality of God’s amazing grace, and he knows it’s available to his friends in Philippi. And he also knows what it’s like to experience the peace that “surpasses all understanding” (Philippians 4:7); it is his heartfelt desire that his brothers and sisters in Christ be wrapped up in it too.\nThis simple verse is a beautiful picture of the kingdom. In earthly terms, Paul is the one in need. He’s in prison. He should be asking for help. But he sees the world through the lens of heaven, so he is content, and his desire is for his friends to receive the gifts—namely the grace and peace of God.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

This desire can be subtle and masquerade as goodness, but we all have it in us to some degree. Even Jesus’s own disciples argued about who would be the greatest among them (Luke 22:24). While we may not always argue with our mouths, we compete in our hearts. Inward competition is just as divisive as the outward kind. \nOne of the fascinating things about this letter from Paul is his specific inclusion of so many names here at the end. Why does the well known and well respected apostle, the “alpha wolf” in this scenario, take time to include these names most of us won’t recognize? Let’s dig deeper and see what we can learn about them.\nTychicus, a native of Asia Minor, delivered not only this letter to Colossae, but also the letter to the church in Ephesus and Paul’s personal letter to Philemon. God used this man to carry the Word of God to His people. The world doesn’t have to know your name in order for you to do something significant for God.\nOnesimus. Talk about a step of faith—Onesimus was the runaway slave of Philemon. While in Rome, he met Paul and subsequently met Jesus. Both Colossians and Philemon tell the story of how the gospel saved Philemon’s life. In Onesimus’s relationship with Philemon, we see forgiveness and restoration at work, a glimpse of the unifying power of the gospel.\nAristarchus, from Thessalonica, joined Paul on his journey and gave his life and freedom so that others may know Christ.\nMark had a reputation. He had bailed on Paul earlier which caused a fall out between Paul and Barnabas (Acts 13:13, 15:39). Mark grew spiritually and now worked alongside Paul, who instructed the church to welcome him. Mark shows us that the gospel is bigger than our conflict.\nEpaphras, who was from the Colossae area, “contended” for them in his prayers (Colossians 4:12). The Greek word for “contend” means “to fight for.” Epaphras fought for the church at Colossae in his prayers, demonstrating that we can be fighters not with fists but with hearts devoted to God.\nLuke, author of the Gospel that bears his name and the book of Acts, seems to have stayed with Paul throughout his imprisonment, aiding in the ministry of the gospel.\nDemas appears to have deserted Paul and chased after the things of this world (2 Timothy 4:10). In his sobering story, we see the reality of our need to pursue Christ.\nNympha was a wealthy Christian woman who valued the gospel over possessions. She hosted the church in her home, using her earthly treasure for heavenly gain.\nAfter naming all these people and more, Paul charges Archippus (possibly the son of Philemon) to pay attention to the ministry he has received in the Lord, so that he may accomplish it (Colossians 4:17).\nPaul is not competing with the people he lists in his letter. He loves them. He is not trying to be the alpha wolf. He is trying to be the Lord’s servant.\nWhat would it look like if we as the church laid aside our competition and intentionally encouraged and exhorted our brothers and sisters in Christ? Jesus said, “By this all people will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another” (John 13:35). Paul’s conclusion to his letter reveals this recognizable love in the way he addresses his friends.\nAs Christians, may we not be identified by our competitiveness but by our love. And may that love show the gospel at work in our lives to those around us.\n\n                ",

There is nothing more satisfying for me than engaging with someone about their life or important issues facing our world. When it comes to talking about the gospel, I get even more energized because I know these occasions can have eternal significance.\nThis passage from Colossians is largely about how we interact with those who do not know Christ. Paul takes for granted that Christian people will interact with those around them, particularly people with little understanding of the gospel. Like a good pastor, Paul encourages these believers to make the most of these opportunities. As believers, we are to thoughtfully represent Christ to those who don’t know Him.\nDo you think about your conversations with non-Christians very much? Do you reflect on the content or the quality of those interactions? You may be one of the only authentic followers of Jesus your non-believing friends or co-workers come into contact with on any given day.\nPaul challenges us to be more intentional with how we represent Christ to the world. He says we should “act wisely toward outsiders, making the most of the time,” and our words should be “gracious, seasoned with salt” (Colossians 4:5-6).\nGraciousness in speech refers to a generosity of spirit. Have you ever met someone who is not set on needing the last word or winning an argument? I’m guilty of seeking both. Gracious speech invites further conversation, with a genuine interest in the one to whom we speak. Our speech is also to be “salty.” If speech can be “colorful,” then I guess it can also be flavorful. Salty speech is relevant, engaging, and thoughtful. It takes skill, but we must learn to speak so that our words convey the truth of Christ in an intelligible way. This takes practice and discernment to learn “how to answer each person” (v. 6).\nThe gospel is the best news ever given to our weary world. As we encounter those who do not know Christ, let us share the greatest news the world has ever heard with generosity and creativity, always seeking to make the most of every opportunity.\nwritten by Chris Comstock\n\n                ",

It’s not the instructions that necessarily bother me—I’m as good as the Pharisees at following rules. It’s my heart that trips me up. \nIn this passage from Colossians, Paul calls his readers not only to submit, love, and obey; but to do so with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord (Colossians 3:22). He urges them not only to work heartily, but to do so for the Lord and not for man, and not by way of eye service or as people-pleasers (3:22-23). He reminds them that, in everything they do and in all their earthly relationships, they are serving Jesus, their master in Heaven (3:23-4:1).\nThis list from Paul is tough for me because it completely kicks against the way my flesh approaches work and relationships. Left to myself, I’m a good and hard worker—so long as someone will notice and pat me on the back. Left to myself, I can put on a good face and fulfill my relational duties—but not with a sincere heart and not with a posture that serves the Lord. \nBut the beauty of this text is that it doesn’t stand alone. This isn’t a list of instructions Christians are expected to follow without the context of the gospel. These instructions are found in a letter that details the authority and goodness of Jesus and the redemption of God’s people (Colossians 1:13-17). Left to ourselves, we couldn’t submit to these instructions with sincere hearts; but, because God has raised us with Christ, we can follow Christ’s example through Christ’s strength. We are a new creation with hearts made new (Colossians 3:10). We’ve already been given both the grace to follow through as well as the forgiveness when we fail.\nAnd so, may we receive these instructions and fulfill God’s design for our relationships with an awareness that we’ve been given new hearts. May we work unto the Lord—for Him and not for man. And may we do what Christ has asked of us—submit, love, obey, and work heartily—not by any earthly power and not for any earthly prize, but through the power of Christ in us and for the glory of God our Father.\nwritten by Billy Jack Brawner\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Every Sunday I put on a white robe called an alb (it looks about as funny as it sounds). It’s what most priests wear during worship. My close friends give me a hard time when they see me in it, mostly because it is unlike anything else I wear. I prefer flannel and jeans, or a hoodie and shorts, but on Sundays, I put on my alb. I don’t look cool in it. I wear it because it reminds me and everyone else of a profound truth: Christians are a people who have put on Christ. We have been clothed in a “new self” (Colossians 3:9-10). This is why people often wear white when they are baptized as well. We adorn ourselves in white garments because we are (and bear with me, guys) pure and holy as a bride awaiting the groom (Ephesians 5:27).  \nWhat Paul writes in this part of the letter to the Church at Colossae is about the life that is birthed when we are made new in Christ. Paul says, “so if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above” (Colossians 3:2). This raising is a mystery whereby we are buried with Christ and raised with Him in His resurrection. By God’s grace, we take off the old garments that defined us before we were dead and buried, and replace them with new garments in our resurrection (Galatians 3:27).  \nIn Christ, we are a different kind of people. “Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too may walk in a new way of life” (Romans 6:4). We put off those things which defined us before we met Christ, and replace them with compassion, humility, meekness, patience, forgiveness, and above all, love (Colossians 3:12-14). God moves us from death to life.   \nOn baptism days we have a tradition in my church that Christians have practiced for centuries. Since I already look ridiculous in my alb, it makes no difference if I also carry a “priest broom.” (I know this sounds strange. Just listen.) After we baptize those who have come to the waters, I get to place my broom in the water and sling it into the crowd of people. It hits them in their faces, it gets on their clothes, it ruins their hair— it gets everywhere. But I say to them, “Remember your baptism.” Likewise, I say to you now, “Remember yours.” \nRemember that you have been raised with Christ; you have put off the old self and have been clothed in righteousness. So now, in everything you do, do it in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father.  \nwritten by Father Aaron Wright\n \n\n                ",

(Colossians 2:16-17) Why would the apostle need to tell these young Christians to resist bowing to those who teach that the way to spiritual health comes through asceticism— the self-denial and fasting summarized in verse 21 as “Do not handle. Do not taste. Do not touch”?\nFalse teachers had descended on the Colossian church, teaching that true believers in God needed to practice self-discipline, observe certain festivals, and follow a certain diet in order to claim genuine faith. \nAt first blush, many of us might say those rules don’t sound like much of a life. Who would be tempted to fall into those traps?\nBut Paul is not speaking to the particular rules themselves. He is speaking to the heart behind them. Paul is essentially saying, These guys will come through and they will have an air of wisdom. They will be very persuasive. They will appeal to your consciences. And you will be tempted.\nPaul knows the human heart. He knows we will always find the prospect of turning genuine faith into a system of alluring rules. Show us the levers to pull and the button to push to get this faith up and running; tell us what to do and what to avoid in order to get our spiritual lives in order, and we will always be tempted to lean in and listen.\nPaul does not completely demonize ceremonies or the observance of holy days. What he is saying is that those things were given to foreshadow the coming of Christ. They were given as symbols of the promise that the relationship between God and man would one day be restored. Christ has fulfilled that hope. Ceremonies and holy days are only shadows. Christ is the substance of our faith. \nFor as long as the church exists on this earth, we will need to be reminded that Christ is not after our behavior. He is after our hearts. Hearts are not won by prescribing rules. But for the heart that loves God, devotion and obedience become the overflow of our affection and trust. This is what Paul wants to mark the lives of the believers in Colossae, and this is what Christ Himself wants for us—that our devotion and discipline would flow out of our love for Jesus Christ, the substance of our faith.\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

Even look at the book titles of many of today’s best-selling Christian personalities. What do you see? People offering the secrets to a better life. The writer of Ecclesiastes tells us that there is nothing new under the sun (Ecclesiastes 1:9). This desire in us to crack the code to a better life has been on our minds since the fall of man. We are drawn to the false promises like moths to a flame.\nIn Colossians 2, Paul writes to the church about some false teachers who have begun to deceive many new Christians through empty lies based on human traditions. The fact that Paul doesn’t give us more specifics about their teaching here is, I believe, part of the wisdom of God. We have to infer the false teaching based on the truth Paul offers as its substitute.\nWhat does Paul tell us? He says we need not try to find life in empty things because we have already been given life in Christ, in whom all the fullness of God dwells (Colossians 1:19). What sort of life have we been given? It is the kind of life where we have been filled with the Spirit of God (Colossians 2:9-10). It is the kind of life where we are joined to Christ in a covenantal bond (Colossians 2:11). It is the kind of life where we have been buried with Him in baptism and have been raised to newness of life by the power of God who also raised Christ (Colossians 2:12).\nIt is the kind of life where, though we were once dead in our sins, we have now been made alive. It is the kind of life where we are forgiven of our sins, where the debt we owed because of our transgressions has been paid in full; the notice of the cancelled debt has been nailed to the cross and we bear it no more (Colossians 2:13-14). The cross of Christ marks a decisive triumph over the power of the devil, and what follows that victory is a triumphal parade celebrating the security we have in Christ forever (Colossians 2:15).\nRead this summary of the riches we have in Christ from Colossians 2 and ask this question: what else does your heart pine for? And why? We are just as susceptible today as Paul’s original readers to chase after the hollow promises of a better life. What resides in us that would make us want to listen to empty philosophies?\nMay we use the Word of God to investigate the desires of our own hearts even as we consider the magnificence of the victory of Jesus, who has given us not only a guilt-free life, but also an eternal home in His presence forever.\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

But, for as long as I can remember, I have wrestled with my faith. There are questions that, at times, I just can’t seem to shake. There are things of God that I have difficulty reconciling with the world I see around me. Doubts nag at me. Unbelief crouches at my doorstep. I am easily swayed by the teachings of this world, constantly reminded that I need God to give me grace to believe. \nLately, it feels like my doubts have rooted themselves more deeply than before. I was telling this to a friend the other day, as a confession of sorts and a request for prayer. He reminded me that, in seasons of doubt, the best thing I can do is to look intently at the personhood of Jesus. He suggested that focusing on Jesus—on who He is and what He did—would allow me to acknowledge my doubts without feeling the need to sort out every single question, because Jesus is sufficient. Faith in Jesus is sufficient.\nIn this text, we see Paul doing something similar with the people of Colossae and Laodicea. He writes to them with a deep love, struggling and toiling with all the energy Jesus has given him to be a servant of the church, “to make God’s message fully known” (Colossians 1:25). Paul warns that, like me, they are prone to be deluded by the plausible arguments of false teachers. And, like my friend, Paul confronts this tendency by pointing them back to Jesus, reminding them that “all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Him” (Colossians 2:3).\nWe find comfort when we place our doubt next to the wisdom and knowledge of Christ. Because He Himself is wisdom and knowledge, faith in Jesus is sufficient when facing doubts, false teachers, and cultural norms that war against our faith. Faith in Jesus is sufficient because Jesus is sufficient.\nLet us continue to live our lives in Christ and may we be deeply rooted and firmly built in Him, knowing He holds the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. May our faith be strengthened by what we have been taught by His Word and Spirit, and may we strenuously persevere with all the strength of Christ that so powerfully works in us.\nwritten by Billy Jack Brawner\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Have you ever found it impossible to explain something? I used to backpack the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland every summer. I don’t know why I kept going back to the same place again and again. Pictures or grand words could never capture the reality of just being there. It has always been a struggle to explain my love for it. I have since learned to say, “It’s just mysterious.”\nI’ve learned to do this with things of the faith as well. Eugene Peterson, in his book Unnecessary Pastor, says this about mystery: “Mystery is not the lack of meaning; it’s more meaning than we can comprehend.” I don’t throw myself on the mystery “excuse” so I can dodge conversations, but so I can fully engage them. What we find with mystery is the freedom to say some pretty amazing things without fully comprehending them or knowing how to explain them perfectly.\nPaul most likely didn’t write this part of Scripture. Sure, he penned the letter, but this is an early Christian hymn birthed in the worship life of the infant Church. This is some of the earliest (and best) Christian theology we have. Paul is not sharing with the Colossians something new; he is reminding them of a song they already know. This song is the basis of Paul’s letter to them, and one of the earliest faith statements of the Church. In fact, as you journey further into the letter to the Colossians, you will see the themes of this song woven throughout. It is inescapable.\nI believe the words of this hymn not because I can make perfect sense of them, but because I can’t. The mystery of Christ is far too rich, far too deep, far too mysterious for me to not believe. There is no way we can explain who “the image of the invisible” is without sooner or later leaning on mystery. Fully human and fully divine, Creator of all things, in Him all things hold together—these are statements that stretch our imagination to see beyond that which we can comprehend. And these are core beliefs of the worshipping church to whom Paul is writing.\nThe real beauty comes not when we can recite the hymn or know its intricacies, but when it captures us. When it moves us to worship. When we realize that He, Christ—who is, in His flesh, the image of the invisible God—reconciled us to Himself through His death. That’s a place we can keep coming back to again and again.\nBrothers, may Christ, Lord of all, bless and keep you. May your hearts and minds be daily made new, strengthened in the deep well of love that pours forth from our God. And, may you be in awe of the deep mysteries, finding them not a place of confusion but of faith and encouragement.\nwritten by Father Aaron Wright\n\n                ",

I don’t remember mine, but bet it was exhilarating! \nIt is not quite as exciting to take steps as I’m sure it once was, but it definitely makes life a whole lot easier when you are skilled at it. Sometimes maturity can sound boring, as if the excitement has been taken out of something. However, in reality, maturity allows us to navigate life in a more skilled fashion, avoiding dangerous pitfalls and living a life that flourishes.\nIn many areas of our lives we are on a natural trajectory towards maturity. We grow from infants to toddlers, from adolescents to teens, and finally to adults. This happens automatically, without much thinking or even active participation— it just happens. Maturity in some aspects of our lives, on the other hand, will not just happen in the way of growing taller, getting a deeper voice, or growing facial hair (some of us are still hoping for that last one). In fact, in key areas of our lives, maturity necessitates—even requires—that we actively participate in, foster, and nurture our growth. Otherwise, we will remain in an early stage of development.\nPaul is writing to a Colossian church just beginning to take its first steps in their newfound faith in Jesus. He is letting these young believers know that he is praying for them, that the new life planted in them would permeate their lives and have its effect. \nGod’s primary objective and delight is for us to grow up and walk. This is His goal for us: “to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God” (v. 10). We are to actively cooperate with God in this endeavor of taking on the character of Jesus. As we do, we will not only bear the fruit of spiritual maturity (Galatians 5:22-23), but we will actually come to know more intimately the God who saved us.\nThe reality is we need power to grow. And it will not come from mustering it up, but by the powerful rule of God that has taken its place in our lives through the bold rescue of Jesus Christ (v. 13). In Jesus, God has secured both forgiveness of and freedom from our sin. Our response: give thanks and grow!\nAs men of God, may we pursue maturity in our walks with God, living lives worthy of our redemption in Jesus Christ.\nwritten by Chris Comstock\n\n                ",

Who are the men that you “do life” with?\nWhen we read the opening of Paul’s letter, it seems pretty standard. We are tempted to quickly move past it but, if we do, we miss a glimpse into how Paul is living his life. Paul begins his letter to the believers at Colossae by mentioning Timothy. One of the things we know about Timothy is that he was young, and others would at times use his youth against him (1 TImothy 4:12). So why would Paul, now a recognizable name and voice of authority in the early church, take the time to specifically mention such a young person in the faith?\nThough Paul doesn’t tell us directly, we can see as we read through his other letters (1 & 2 Timothy, specifically) that Paul is empowering Timothy. This reveals a humility in Paul that is often lacking in our culture today.\nWe love to platform ourselves, to brag or build our identity around our accomplishments. In his letter to the Colossians, Paul orients people to Christ, not himself. He is not threatened by including others into the work God is doing—he is actually validating that God can and does work in others, quite possibly even those you would least expect.\nPaul’s actions of including and validating Timothy reveal the heart of discipleship—a heart that is centered on Christ and not accolades, a heart that encourages and fosters growth. This is so important to the new believers in Colossae. Although they would draw a line between themselves and Paul, they could relate even more with Timothy, who was also half Gentile. Paul’s inclusion of those younger in the faith shows the reality of the transforming power of the gospel and makes it more difficult for me to alienate myself from it due to my inadequacies.\nEncouraging one another in Christ may strip us of our excuses, but it also also helps us solidify our understanding of our identity in Christ.\nPaul sees the importance of being united in Christ and encouraging those who battle alongside us for the sake of the gospel. The Christian life is not a race we are meant to run alone. While we may sometimes find ourselves out in front, may we, like Paul, not misplace our significance in our position. May we instead encourage those around us toward the gospel.\nLet us not make the race about us, but instead run together, encouraging one another towards the true prize: knowing the fullness of Christ.\nwritten by Britton Sharp\n\n                ",

I’ve moved several times in my life and every time the transition has been a struggle, no matter how excited I was to live in that new city. I would get lost, feel out of place, and when things got overwhelming, I would wonder if I should have even moved to begin with. \nThe people of Colossae were new—new to Christianity, that is. Colossae, located in modern-day Turkey, was located at a crossroads, making the city both a commercial and tourist destination. Paul had most likely never been there, but he had heard of their faith and pursuit of holiness (Colossians 1:4). The Colossian church was primarily made up of Gentile believers who, according the focus of Paul’s letter, were being confronted with teachings contrary to the gospel of Christ. Paul’s desire in his writings is to encourage the Colossian believers in their new faith and help them form a stable foundation on which to grow.\nPaul points out early in his letter that central figure in the Christian faith is Christ Himself: “He is before all things, and in him all things hold together” (Colossians 1:17). Paul appeals to the Colossians to orient their lives and faith around Christ, not the persuasive yet false teachings we’ll read about in Chapter 2.\nIn the final two chapters of the letter, Paul continues the theme of the supremacy of Christ by discussing how the believer ought to live as a citizen in this new city. He talks about how to protect and defend the city, identifying the characteristics of a healthy citizen and how they should conduct themselves. They are to live as “God’s chosen ones, holy and loved” (Colossians 3:12).\nAs we read through the book of Colossians together, may we remember that our citizenship is in heaven. Whether we are new to our literal or metaphorical city or have resided there awhile, we must orient ourselves to Christ alone.\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Sometimes faithfully following Christ is exhausting. Day after day we get up, look ahead, and see a climb with no end in sight. We scrabble and scramble ahead, then fall sideways, then slip back, then slog and crawl ahead again. Over time we get worn down.\nWhen we feel this way we need encouragement, or maybe a good kick in the pants. We need a glimpse of what lies ahead so that the grind of life today, in the moment, feels worth it and we find motivation. And that’s what we find in these passages from today’s reading. \nFirst, Paul describes how he prays for believers, so they will know they are in the hands of God. This reminds us of our own security, and the source of our ability to persevere. Then he points to his own life as an example. Now we know someone has gone before us and has been faithful through great struggle. If Paul can do it with God’s help, then we can find hope and motivation too (2 Thessalonians 3:1-5). \nThen we see the reason for our struggle. It is not in vain; it is in resisting the devil who actively seeks to destroy us. We are fleeing temptation and fighting sin. And as we do this, we are spreading the Word through our faithfulness, both by our example and through our profession. Our struggle is for our own well-being and for the salvation of others.\nYes, this will cost us, most likely, far more than just fatigue. We will suffer. We will face conflict with those who refuse to follow Jesus, especially those closest to us. We will become weary and wonder if it is worth it. Our weariness might lead to doubts or apathy or just plain giving up. \nThat is why Paul writes “do not grow weary in doing good” (v. 13). And he pairs it with a promise: God’s love will direct the believer’s heart, allowing us to press on, powered by Christ’s endurance. Christ was faithful in pressing on, resisting temptation, navigating difficulties, and facing His suffering to the utmost—and without failing! The Lord will certainly lead believers to that same endurance. \nIf we press on, if we do not let our weariness get the best of us, we will be established and strengthened. We will always slip and slide, but we will gain ground. We will fail, but we will show the world the faithfulness of God to us in Christ. So let us pray as Paul prayed. Let us follow his example as he followed Christ’s, and move forward—however nearly spent and discouraged—one step at a time. \n“The God of all grace, who called [us] to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, establish, strengthen, and support [us] after [we] have suffered a little while. To him be dominion forever. Amen” (1 Peter 5:10-11).\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    If there is one thing that unsettles men, it is deception. If you have ever been lied to, deceived, or manipulated in any way, I imagine you have felt alarmed and shaken to your core. In a sense, this is justified; deception is born in the pits of hell.\nThe father of all lies is the defeated one, Satan. Jesus makes it very clear in John 8 that there is no truth in him (v. 44). Moreover, one of the ways the evil one seeks to devour the faith and hope of the church is by spreading deceptive doctrine (1 Timothy 4:1). These things are important as we approach 2 Thessalonians, where the church has been deceived to believe that the day of the Lord had already come.\nThe second coming of Christ is a foundational doctrine of the New Testament church. When speaking of Christ’s imminent return, the aim of the apostles was to spur the church on—through affliction and trials, toward the hope of Christ’s final vindication, where all things are made right.\nImagine if you are counted among the Thessalonian Christians, awaiting the return of Christ for final deliverance from life’s most difficult challenges. Now imagine that you have been deceived to believe that it has already occurred. You would probably ask questions like, Where is the final justice God promised? Where is the vindication of the righteous that Christ secured? Where is the fulfillment of God’s most comforting promises for the suffering believer?\nIf it were me, I would have been shaken, alarmed, even disheartened. For this reason, Paul urges the church to not “let anyone deceive you in any way” (2 Thessalonians 2:3). This exhortation still holds true for us today.  \nSatan has been a liar from the beginning. His aim has always been the same, to pull Christians away from their hope and joy in the promises of Christ. The deception of the church in Thessalonica was not so different from the other forms of deception used by Satan today.\nHave you ever been deceived enough to question if God really loves you? Have you ever been deceived enough to question whether or not God hears your prayers, or even cares? Have you ever been tempted to despair over your circumstances? In all of these cases, Satan’s aim is to steal your joy and diminish your hope.\nThe Apostle Paul is clear: Let no one deceive you! Do not let the evil one rob you of your joy and hope in Christ. Deception is a spiritual war waged in the minds and hearts of men, fought by assaulting the lies of the enemy with the truth of God. Christian, take up your armor and fight for faith! We learned this from our Master. Satan tempted Jesus three times, and three times the offer was refused (Matthew 4:1-11). All three times, Jesus fought back with the truths found in Scripture, saying, “It is written.” \nDo not be deceived, but hold fast to the truth of the gospel.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

The officer, the pilot, and the Olympic medal winner—all revealed by their hypocrisy and inconsistency—were no longer allowed to represent the police force, serve in the military, or compete on behalf of their country. Commitment matters. Honor counts. When it comes to representing Christ, our actions aren’t irrelevant, but the good news is we aren’t left to navigate it all on our own.\nIn today’s reading, the Thessalonian Christians are under severe persecution from the surrounding culture. The pressure to faithfully live as disciples of the crucified and risen God-Man are heating up around them. And yet, instead of retreating or dividing from one another, their love is increasing in all directions. Paul tells them, “We ought to thank God always for you, brothers and sisters, and rightly so, since your faith is flourishing and the love each one of you has for one another is increasing” (2 Thessalonians 1:3). \nTheir unflinching devotion is so alien and heart-warming that it even causes Paul to brag about them to other Christians. “Therefore, we ourselves boast about you among God’s churches—about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and afflictions that you are enduring” (v. 4). When the apostle Paul is bragging on you, it’s got to be hard to stay humble—that is, unless you know, like Paul, where the strength to persevere originates.\nPaul doesn’t pray that the Thessalonians would muster their collective energies and elbow grease to be worthy disciples of Christ. Nor does he give them ten hot tips to be worthy of Christ’s call to discipleship, sanctification, and glorification. Rather, Paul guides the heart of the Thessalonians to where their focus—and ours—must reside.\nHe prays that God, not they themselves, will make them worthy of His calling. Paul remembers what we often forget: God will get us to the other side. God will strengthen us. God makes us fit the call of discipleship. God gives us the nutrients and calories to endure till the end. He is the fuel in our good works, the holy umph in our lives.\nWe can’t make ourselves worthy; the gospel is bad news for self-actualization. But the gospel is good news for sinners who realize they need a mighty Savior. Jesus alone makes us worthy. He gives us the badge, the wings, and the medal. Why? Because He earned them for us. \n“By his power fulfill your every desire to do good and your work produced by faith, so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified by you, and you by him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ” (vv. 11–12). Whatever challenges are ahead, they are not ahead of God or His work in making you fit for His calling. He is with you.\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

In view of such a list, it is tempting to lock the doors and pull the curtains. Keep your head down, do your job, protect those around you, and try to sock away enough money for retirement. No doubt there are times when such a response is necessary. It’s a survival mechanism. However, there are other times, maybe more times than we’d like to admit, when to retreat is a refusal of God’s will for us.  \nConsider these two statements:\nHold on to what is good.\nDon’t hold back.\nThey sound almost contradictory. But in the context of today’s Scripture passages, the second actually complements the first, giving us clarity as to how God wants us to live. In light of all the darkness around us, our challenge is to not lose hope, but to “hold on to what is good” (1 Thessalonians 5:21). Goodness is just as strong a presence in our world as evil, stronger even, but evil gets all the headlines. We know this. So it takes a hearty faith to, as the Journey song says, “Don’t stop believing.”\nBut faith without works is dead (James 2:14-26). We know this too. God’s will for us is that our belief then compels us to action. To not hold back, to not retreat, as tempting as it is, but to stay engaged and “pursue what is good for one another and for all” (v. 15). God calls us to live lives with open hands and open hearts and open minds and open homes and open wallets. This will take all your courage. The writer Annie Dillard describes such an all-in, full-on commitment this way: “to fling yourself at what you’re doing… to point yourself, forget yourself, aim, dive.” To live in a closed-off withdrawn way is the scrooge’s life—fearful there’s really not enough to go around, and believing evil really does win in the end.\nHold on to what is good. Don’t hold back. Fling yourself into life. In terms of what that looks like, yes, it varies according to the moment. But Scripture gives us some timeless directions.\nConsider these:\nRejoice always!\nPray constantly.\nGive thanks in everything.\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When a believer loses a loved one, the Word of God begins to take on new significance. I lost my mother quite unexpectedly three years ago. It was, far and away, the most difficult and painful thing that I have had to walk through. As challenging as it was to do, I preached the sermon at her funeral. In the moments leading up to her funeral and in the days that followed, I started to understand in new ways why the Apostle Paul charged the Thessalonians to “encourage one another with these words”—words about the truth of the resurrection of believers (1 Thessalonians 4:18). \nThe resurrection is the great hope that God has given us as we make our way through the valley of the shadow of death. However, it is a truth that has often been misunderstood, neglected, denied, and even perverted. \nSome in the congregation in Thessalonica had let themselves be led astray by false teaching that insisted that those who remained alive until Jesus returned were those who received the divine blessing. In this sense, they were tempted to think that those who had passed away prior to the return of Christ were not counted as blessed by God. We don’t know all of the precise nuances of this false teaching, but we do know that Paul believed it to be of such significance that he devoted an entire section of this letter to the doctrine of the resurrection. \nIn 1 Thessalonians 4, Paul set out the divine blueprint for the resurrection of believers: “For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the archangel’s voice, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are still alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord” (vv. 16-18).\nThis is the unfolding of the events surrounding the resurrection. The importance of this order must not be missed. Those who have passed away in Christ are now with Christ. They will come with Christ at His return, and their souls and bodies will be reunited by His resurrection power. Then, those who are alive when Christ comes will be reunited with them and with the Lord. \nWe often feel as though there is no end to sorrow in this fallen and dying world. However, believers have the hope of the resurrection. And because of this, the comfort we derive from the hope of the resurrection checks our sorrow. \nAll of this is based on God’s Word, which is why Paul tells us to comfort one another with these words found in Scripture. Our hope is grounded on the Word about the resurrection of Jesus, the resurrection of our loved ones, and our own resurrection. The coming of our Lord is guaranteed, and the resurrection of believers is guaranteed with His return.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

I could hardly pass my high school physics class let alone explain how substantive scientific issues work. I have a hard time remembering what the formula for something as simple as momentum is. All I know is that if you push it and it rolls, inertia has been overcome. (Please email me if I’m wrong, physicists). \nEqually complex and difficult for me to explain is the concept of holiness. At times, I think I would do better explaining string theory. That’s how I feel when I hear people talk about holiness. It is an utterly essential component to the Christian faith, yet only the wisest, best minds seem to be capable of articulating what it is exactly. Often it comes with a Latin wrapper of language that muddles the concept for me even more. \nBut Paul makes holiness abundantly practical. In today’s passage he tells us that God’s will for our lives is that we are sanctified, which means “made holy.” He then unpacks what it means to “live in holiness,” explaining what it consists of in a practical way. It’s keeping away from sex outside the context of marriage, exercising self-control, loving your brother and sister in the Lord, minding your own business, working hard and well, and behaving as decent citizens in your communities (1 Thessalonians 4:3–7). \nIn many ways the mystery of holiness is not all that mysterious. It’s readily practical and down to earth. Holiness isn’t something that is outside our grasp after all. God intends for us to be holy in our everyday lives—here and now. That is His will for us. \nThe challenge Paul brings to the Thessalonians, and to us, is simply to keep pursuing this holiness. The practical outworkings of holiness are the simple things of everyday life. The question is, do we believe God’s Word for us more than we love our own way of living? Do we believe His way is better? Will we walk in the day-to-day holiness He has for us?\nUnlike string theory, holiness is not a complex, overwhelming mystery. It’s being faithful to your wife. Being vigilant against lust and sexual temptations. It’s keeping your word, loving your neighbor, and living an ordinary life that has been changed by God’s extraordinary grace. That’s the holiness we’re called to. \nWe won’t be perfect. Thank God for His grace. But we are called to live in the holiness we’re given in Christ. And a big part of living in holiness is learning to walk in it.\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

We hit a concrete barrier in the middle of the highway and flipped back into the southbound lanes of traffic, landing on the roof of our Toyota Camry. It was the most terrifying experience of both of our lives. We crawled out of the car with minor physical injuries but lasting emotional ones. The horrifying event dramatically changed how I relate to my wife and how I love other people. You don’t walk away from a traumatic accident like that unchanged, even if physically unscathed.\nToward the end of his first letter to the Christians at Thessalonica, Paul encourages his readers by transcribing his prayer for them. In 1 Thessalonians 3:12, he prays, “And may the Lord cause you to increase and overflow with love for one another and for everyone, just as we do for you.” \nAs he says earlier the chapter, Paul is anxious about the Christians at Thessalonica (vv. 1-5). He fears that Satan has tempted them to abandon the Christian faith because of the difficulty and persecution they’ve had to endure as a result of their faith in Jesus.\nIn today’s reading, as Paul finishes up his letter to his brothers and sisters in the faith, he feels the need to encourage them. If they are going to be able to endure the hardships that have already afflicted them and the troubles that are yet to come, they would have to love each other with an overflowing love that can not be quelled no matter the circumstances or persecution they face. The love the Christians in Thessalonica have for one another needs to be strengthened despite their hardships, not eroded by them. \nIn the same way that our terrible crash drew my wife and I closer together and radically changed the way we love each other, so we Christians must love one another in times of hardship with an overflowing kind of love that is bolstered by difficulty, not defeated by it. \nLike Paul prays for the Christians of Thessalonica, our understanding of God’s love for us must cause our hearts to overflow with love for others. Any trials or difficulties we may encounter must serve to strengthen, not weaken, our love for one another.\nWritten by Chris Martin \n\n                ",

It declares us to be His sons and daughters—even heirs. The gospel is secured by Christ, our own Savior, who gave His life and body for us, that we might be with Him in the eternal and heavenly kingdom. The truth and power of the gospel is sealed by the Spirit, who indwells us, binding us to Him, making us intimate friends. \nIt’s no wonder, then, that the gospel should also transform the nature of all human relation and interaction. \nPaul fills his letter to the Thessalonians with deeply personal language, calling them brothers and sisters, “our glory and our joy” (1 Thessalonians 2:20). He reminds them of how he has been with them, gently nurturing their faith and community, sharing his own life with them—encouraging, comforting, imploring, working night and day on their behalf. He tells them, “We were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives” (v. 8). Time and again Paul repeats how he has longed to see them face to face.  \nI am humbled by this great witness of the power of the gospel. I long to be able to say, with Paul, that I have labored devoutly, righteously, and blamelessly—that I have lived worthy of God, who calls us into His own kingdom and glory. But I am humbled because I can never be worthy but for the redeeming work of the cross. \nEven now, I am prone to see all of my shortcomings, and fix my eyes upon them instead of on the work of Christ, instead of on the gospel. But the gospel is precisely where Paul would have us fix our eyes. There, we find transformation and healing, hope and joy, and even glory. It is a life-on-life transformation: Christ’s life in His people, ministering in the rich communion of the saints. \nThe Word of God, Paul writes, works effectively in those who believe its truths and receive the gospel message (1 Thessalonians 2:13). The writer of Hebrews puts it even more strongly: “For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any double-edged sword, penetrating as far as the separation of soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart” (Hebrews 4:12).\nThe gospel doesn’t merely change our minds; it reshapes our hearts and our lives in every way. It takes dying, grumbling, limping, and feeble souls, and transforms them into glory and joy, into crowns of boasting.

Instead of pontificating about the philosophical realities you’re facing, they’re the ones who enter the mess with you and walk with you through the challenges and the painful moments whether or not you’ve reached resolution, healing, or victory. \nThe Apostle Peter tells us we should not be surprised when affliction comes our way. “Instead, rejoice as you share in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may also rejoice with great joy when his glory is revealed” (1 Peter 4:13). Peter is primarily talking about our individual sharing of Christ’s sufferings with Him. However, there is another layer here; we are to rejoice in sharing Christ’s sufferings with one another. For Peter knew that shared suffering and perseverance would build not only a deeper connection with Christ, but also a more tightly knit community within the body of Christ. \nPart of Paul’s profound appreciation for the church at Thessalonica stemmed from the fact that they had stuck with him and supported him through thick and thin, “in spite of severe persecution” (1 Thessalonians 1:6). Yet they had not grown weary in doing good, preaching the Word, or caring for those in need. \nWhile Paul initially wrote this passage as a blessing and commendation, there is an implicit call for all of us in Paul’s prayer of blessing. As members of the body of Christ we are meant to share in Christ’s suffering. This often means that we will endure hardship and resistance for the sake of His name and His gospel. This also means we are called to lend a “warm and tender hand” to our friends and other members of the body of Christ. \nFriends, this is where the rubber hits the proverbial road. When we lend our time, our treasures, and our talents to those in need—perhaps at the expense of our own comfort and security—we glorify God and participate in His kingdom work. Instead of fearing the fiery trials, we should aspire to be the kind of local church Paul would thank God for in this present age: empowered by the Holy Spirit to faithfully endure with one another and persevere against that which opposes God’s kingdom. \nThat’s how we become a cause for thanks in tumultuous and painful times.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

These chapters in Acts provide context for our study of 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and give us a foundation for understanding the Apostle Paul’s relationship with this church.\n\nHave you ever been through a tough season, one where you wondered how much more you could bear? Have you ever felt alone in your calling? Have you ever worked at something you believed you were supposed to do, but were met with more opposition than welcome? Have you ever gotten so tired you wondered if you could press on? I have.\nWhen the Apostle Paul wrote 1 and 2 Thessalonians, I have to believe he knew that feeling. He had given his recent years to proclaiming a simple but polarizing message: “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah” (Acts 17:3). The Holy Spirit was working through Paul, but the road to spreading the gospel was tough.\nWhen Paul arrived in Corinth during his second missionary journey, he was beat up, weary, and ready for some encouraging news. Up to that point, he had been driven out of nearly every town he’d visited. It is a miracle of the Holy Spirit that the opposition he faced had not worn him down to nothing. \nBut it wasn’t all opposition. He had seen a few churches take hold along the way. One of those churches was in the port city of Thessalonica, the capital of the Roman province of Macedonia. Today’s reading from the book of Acts gives us the narrative of Paul’s relationship with the Thessalonians—how he planted that church, how the new believers there took his message about the Messiah to heart, and how they stayed hungry for the gospel, learning from Timothy in Paul’s absence.\n\nPaul’s letters to the Thessalonians are like so many of his other letters: filled with theological clarification and instruction for how to live the Christian life. But it doesn’t take long to see that these letters are also a little different from the others, filled with words of affection for these believers who have been a tremendous encouragement to Paul.\nThe legacy of Paul’s letters to the Thessalonians is evidence of the Spirit’s work in the world. Were it not for missions like the one that took Paul to Thessalonica, we would not have the gospel today. And were it not for the Holy Spirit’s work, those missions would have failed to build anything lasting.\nSo when you’re struggling, wondering if you can go on, remember this: the Holy Spirit is at work in the world still. How can we know this? Because Jesus promised He would send the Spirit as our helper in this life (John 14:15-31). When your faith is in Jesus, the Messiah, you are not alone—you are never alone. \nIn the face of impossible odds or unbearable weariness, God is at work. May the Lord encourage your heart as you read these letters and the story surrounding them.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

The man who owned this collection of rare paintings stipulated in his will that no one should be allowed to alter them. The problem was that he stored many of these paintings in the boiler room of his home. Over the years, the coal from the furnace left them tarnished. \nAfter he died, his family made the executive decision to breach his will and have these paintings professionally restored. This was certainly the right decision as his home is now one of the most famous art museums in the world, hosting some of the most rare and wonderful works of art in the world. \nIn many respects, we, by nature, are all like those tarnished paintings. We need God to restore His image in us by the saving grace and work of Christ.\nThe Scriptures are clear that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone. There is absolutely nothing we contribute to our salvation other than the sin that makes it necessary. However, when God redeems individuals through the saving work of Christ and the regenerating work of the Spirit, He begins to restore His image in them. God doesn’t save us by our good works, but He saves us so that we would be zealous for good works. After all, we are His artwork of grace, designed to display His own glory in us (Ephesians 2:10).\nIn the same way as the paintings in the boiler room needed to be professionally restored, so Christ restores the image of God in His redeemed people. He alone can do this since He is Himself the very image of God. Just as Jesus went around doing good, so those who are united to Him by faith, washed in His blood, and filled with His Spirit are to seek to do good. \nWe need to be reminded that this is God’s purpose for us. If the paintings in the boiler room had been left alone, they would be of no good to anyone. God has appointed ministers to continually encourage His people to do good and to be ready for every good work. It is in this way that God displays the glorious artwork of His grace to a world full of those who likewise need to undergo that same restoration in Christ.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

It was a great job for a number of reasons, and I was actually good at what I did. So good, in fact, that they knew I was leaving and promoted me anyway—six months before I left for seminary.\nI don’t tell you this story to brag, but to explain why I was able to have the most coveted cubicle in my department. It was away from everyone else and over by the printer, so I was by myself but never really alone. And since I was by myself, I could listen to music and sermons. Back in those days, I was listening to lots of sermons on cassette tapes, but I can only remember one. The preacher’s text was from Titus 2: “For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to say, “No” to ungodliness…” (vv. 11-12). \nHis thesis was that we are conditioned to look at the gospel as the way to enter into the Christian life, but then we look to the law to make us holy. It is the law of God that trains us to say “no” to sin, or so we believe. He said that when we believe the gospel—the good news of what Christ has done for us—we become trained to follow Him in righteousness. When we look at what God the Father has done through God the Son, then God the Spirit changes us. Preaching to ourselves, the beauty of the gospel helps us to say “no” to the ugliness of ungodliness.\nI was glad I had that isolated cubicle, not only so I could listen to that sermon while working, but also because I was able to listen and then let the tears flow down without any embarrassment. You see, I had heard all this before, but until that day, I just kept forgetting. We come to Christ by believing the gospel of His grace. And we follow Christ by doing the same thing. \nThere are two kinds of people reading this. Some of you have never heard the full gospel. You have only heard that believing the gospel is how you become a Christian, but perhaps no one has ever told you that believing the gospel is also how you live as a Christian. The beauty of the rest of the gospel is that it actually teaches us how to turn from sin.\nSome of you are just like me; you’ve heard this before, but you keep forgetting. You forget the beauty. You forget the power of gazing on that beauty. My hope is that you are reminded today that when you are tempted to use the law to fight sin, the gospel is a better teacher of who we are in Christ and the life promised to us.\nWritten by Matthew B.

Not only that, but leaders should be constantly aware of raising up other leaders. You won’t find any more fundamental rules of leadership than these two things.\nIn our passage today, Paul begins his letter to Titus with a few basic ground rules for being a pastor. He doesn’t tell Titus to work on his sermon illustrations or his building budget. He doesn’t tell him to dress a certain way or make sure he reads the right leadership books. Maybe these things have their place, but they aren’t fundamental to leadership in Paul’s mind.\nPaul starts with character. He tells Titus to be humble and self-controlled and sacrificial. He tells him to be bold in this leadership, protecting the people he leads and driving out evil and false teaching. False teachers are “unfit for any good work” (Titus 1:15).\nThese are strong words by Paul. He’s not raising up weak-minded pastors to be nonchalant about sin and heresy. He even tells Titus to be “blameless.” Now, surely, someone like Paul doesn’t mean that Titus should never sin. This is the same Paul who calls himself the “chief of sinners” (1 Timothy 1:15). He’d be quite the hypocrite if he told Titus to be sinless when no one can be—not even Paul (Romans 3).\nPaul is instead comparing two types of leaders: those who are fit for ministry due to their character and striving for truth, and those who are unfit due to their lack of character and striving for falsehood. The idea of blamelessness here refers more to a disposition or worldview rather than pure sinlessness. In other words, God will use a humble, kind, sacrificial, and truth-seeking person, even in his or her weakness and imperfection.\nWhether you’re a pastor, parent, construction worker, school teacher, or astronaut, you’re called to lead. You don’t need a team of marketers reporting to you in order to be a leader. As Christians, we are called in every sphere of life to reflect Christ and teach His ways to others (Matthew 28:18-20). Jesus was perfect and sinless on your behalf; your job is to be “blameless” before others, to point people to the One who was perfect so you don’t have to be. That’s the type of leader—the type of person—God will use.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

Barrie, author of Peter Pan.\n“I’ll finally get to see Marilyn.” – Joe DiMaggio, baseball player formerly married to Marilyn Monroe.\n“I give my soul to God, my body to the earth, and my worldly possessions to my nearest of kin, charging them to remember the sufferings of Jesus Christ.” – Michelangelo, painter.\nLast words are fascinating. We want to know: did the person say something meaningful? Did they summarize their life well? Though not everyone gets to choose the last thing they will say, some, when given the rare opportunity, make the most of it, like Michelangelo.\nToday’s Scripture reading from 2 Timothy includes Paul’s last recorded words. They are, of course, not the last words he spoke (presumably), but they are the last lines of the last existing letter he wrote before being martyred for his faith. So they are the last word we have from Paul. And I don’t know about you, but I love them. \nI love that Paul charges Timothy to preach the Word of God faithfully, noting that it will not always be a welcome message. I love that Paul reflects on his own life and concludes, before God, that he has run his own race to its end, and is finishing well. I love that he is ending his life with a lot of faithful friends around him. And I love that he asks Timothy to bring him his books and his coat because winter is coming. These last verses of 2 Timothy deal with both the theological and the practical—both of which are deeply spiritual.\nA few years back, I became seriously ill and had to put my own house in order. I recovered, but ever since then I’ve thought about the end of my own life quite a bit. I wonder what I will say, who will be around me, where I’ll be, and how I’ll experience the presence of God in that moment. There is an old Puritan prayer that makes me laugh, in which the writer asks God to let him die in a particular way. He writes: \n“Prepare me for death, that I may not die after long affliction or suddenly, but after short illness, with no confusion or disorder, and a quiet discharge in peace, with adieu to brethren. Let not my days end like lumber in a house, but give me a silent removing from one world to another.” \nI love the courage in those words, in essence, saying, If it’s all the same to you, Lord, let me go in this way. \nI suppose what I love most about both that old Puritan prayer and Paul’s last words in 2 Timothy is the way they express a confident hope that the gospel they’ve clung to all these years is still true, burning like a light that attracts these soon-to-depart brothers to their Maker.\nMay you and I, when we come to our own ends in this life, have such an affection for the Lord as Paul. May we not be questioning the truth of the gospel, but rather may we be chained to it. Until then, let me conclude with Paul’s last words from this letter: “The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all” (2 Timothy 4:22).\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

One particular Saturday morning, we set out on a hike that had been recommend to us by a few trusted friends. Since they were Colorado natives and more adventurous than most, we naturally trusted their suggestion and set out for what we hoped would be a memorable afternoon.\nThe hike started out pleasant enough, meandering paths through a wooded glade. Over time the trail began to slowly rise toward the summit. Pointing out gnarled trees and curiously spotted birds to one another, we hardly noticed the change in the slope. We laughed and lingered as we pleased. Several miles later, though, we questioned just how far we actually were from the peak.\nWe began to wonder, “Are we there yet?”\nThe gentle pitch had turned into an aggressive incline. The gnarled trees had become logs crossing and blocking our footpath. The soft breeze had become an unnaturally chilly wind. Our legs were tiring, and our spirits weren’t quite as chipper as when we’d set out. \nBefore either of us spoke it, we both were thinking it: “Maybe we should head back?” \nWe stopped to consider our options. Then we began to head back down, slowly weaving our way through the boulders and rocky outcroppings. \nA stranger passed by, heading uphill. “How was the view today?”\n“Oh,” I muttered, “we didn’t quite make it. Maybe next time.”\n“Are you serious?! You’re less than 500 yards from the top!” \nThis is precisely Paul’s spiritual concern for Timothy in our reading today, and it is still a spiritual concern for each us: that we would give up before we’ve completed the journey and falter before the finish. Paul cautions, “Continue in what you have learned and firmly believed” (1 Timothy 3:14). \nContinue. Sometimes that’s all we can do. It may not feel all that glamorous or exciting, but the call is to continue—not for the joy of each step, but for the wonder of what lies beyond.\nThanks to our encounter with that seasoned hiker, we turned back uphill. We continued. We completed the summit, and the views were more than worth the effort. Filled with awe and wonder, my wife and I rested in a moment of indescribable fulfillment. \nThrough the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, we live a life and walk a journey characterized by grace and redemption. However, this does not mean the way is smooth or the journey is easy. We need only look at the life of Jesus to know this is true. The Christian life will ebb and flow through different seasons. Sometimes the way is easy and the burden feels light; others times the way is steep and perhaps overwhelming. \nIf you’ve come to know Jesus, then I pray that Paul’s challenge and encouragement sticks with you this week. Continue on. Continue on in what you know to be true. Continue on in who you know you were made to be. Continue on in the belief that the summit is closer than you think.\nIf your heart is heavy, if your feet are weary, if your back is sore, if you can’t go one step more, I pray a one-word prayer for you today: continue.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

After the Lord rescued and redeemed me, I heard someone liken false teaching to drugs. He said, “Heretics are like drug addicts. Those who do drugs think that they are doing themselves good, when, in fact, they are progressively destroying themselves. So, those who play with false teaching will be subject to its destructive influence.” This is an apropos illustration. False teaching has a progressively destructive influence on the life of the one who entertains it. \nQuite a number of theologians have insisted that if there were no false teaching, there would be no New Testament. So much of the New Testament is taken up with apostolic warnings about the many varieties of false teaching that had infiltrated the fledgling churches and threatened the spiritual life of those Christ had redeemed. Characteristic of the pastoral letters is the Apostle Paul’s insistence that ministers of the gospel must be on guard against the subtle ways in which false teaching wrecks havoc.  \nThe first thing we have to keep in mind is that words matter. There is no such thing as an inconsequential word. God spoke the world into existence by the Word of His power. He then spoke a Word to His image bearers about His intentions for them as residents of the habitable world over which He had given them dominion. If our first parents were to rightly interpret the newly created world in which they lived, they would need the Word of God to do so. After the fall, Adam and Eve needed God’s Word about the promise of redemption (Genesis 3:15). Listening to the revealed Word of God is the greatest need you and I have today. \nIt should then come as no surprise to us to discover that the attacks of the evil one are directed at the Word of God. After all, when he tempted our first parents, Satan’s first words were, “Did God really say…?” (Genesis 3:1). The power of this temptation lay in the fact that the evil one sought to convince our first parents that it was a noble task for them to question the truthfulness of the Word of God. This continues to be his most potent attack on the members of the Church today. \nMinisters of the gospel are “not to quarrel about words” (2 Timothy 2:14). Instead, they are to “avoid irreverent babble” that will “lead people into more and more ungodliness” (v. 16). There is a progressively destructive nature to false teaching. The more one entertains it—often under the guise of academic sophistication or open-mindedness—the more destructive influence it has on the minds, hearts, and lives of God’s people. \nBy way of contrast, the more we stay in the truth of God’s Word, the more it will impact our spiritual well-being. But, a failure to reject false teaching will cause those who propagate it to “swerve from the truth,” upsetting and weakening the faith of the members the Church (v. 18).\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

I fell out of love with baseball during the younger years of my adulthood because it didn’t have the excitement of college football or the NBA. As I have aged, however, I have come to appreciate baseball again, probably because baseball is more like real life than any other sport. You can be considered a legend in baseball while failing seven out of ten trips to the plate. Baseball season lasts for most of the year, yet division titles may be won by only one or two games, so a baseball player has to do little things well for the long haul. \nPaul’s vision of the Christian life in 2 Timothy 2:1-13 breathes this same ethos. He portrays the Christian as one who lives faithfully day in and day out, doing little things that no one notices. This is the thrust of every image he uses in verses 2-7. A teacher entrusts what he has heard to others not in a moment, but in a lifetime of faithful modeling and teaching. The soldier does not stand out in the crowd, but pleases the one who enlisted him and suffers for his service. The farmer toils in obscurity, but gets his reward in harvest time. The athlete who competes according to the rules works long hours to be prepared for his one shining moment.\nThis kind of slow faithfulness is difficult for those of us nurtured in youth groups where we were transported from one spiritual high to another, showing a burst of zeal for Jesus before going back to where we were. We find encouragement, though, when Paul says, “be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus” (2 Timothy 2:1). Nothing is more difficult than enduring faithfulness, but this burden causes us to despair of our own efforts and lay hold of the strength that only Christ can give. To live faithfully as a man each day requires a strength we do not possess. But God overflows with all the power we need and he gives it freely to those who call out for it.\nPaul closes by pointing us to Jesus Christ, who endured the pain of the cross for the joy set before Him and received the prize of His endurance. In the same way, we endure the difficulty of faithful Christian living but receive the joy of knowing Christ and enjoying His gifts, ultimately receiving our final reward: reigning as joint heirs with Christ. And so, we labor on, pleading for His strength to fill us and looking to our blessed hope.\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

Whether the New Orleans Saints of a prior generation, or our more recent lowly favorite, the Cleveland Browns, the bag-on-the-head guy gets one thing right: it’s embarrassing to root for a pathetically bad football team. \nThat might be how Timothy felt about his father in the faith, Paul. As Paul sat shackled to the wall of a dark prison cell in Rome, you have to wonder if Timothy was ready to find a bag to put over his head and walk away from his calling. Certainly, Paul felt that anxiety regarding Timothy. It’s why he tells him to “rekindle the gift of God that is in you” and “don’t be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, or of me his prisoner” (2 Timothy 1:6, 8). On the surface, living and working for the sake of the gospel looks about as likely as the Browns having a winning season next year (spoiler alert: it’s not going to happen). \nYet, Paul knows why he is on the losing side of the ledger and he wants to convince Timothy that this is exactly where the victory is found. Though Christianity looks like a loss to the world, it is actually power, life, and immortality to those who believe. The Savior who was betrayed, rejected, and crucified is the one who abolished death and enabled Paul to endure the suffering and shame of Roman imprisonment. Paul knew whom he had trusted, and he knew Christ would not let him fall. \nPerhaps you feel like putting a bag over your head when it comes to displaying and declaring your faith in Christ. You fear what others will think about you, or even worse, what they may do to reject you. “Closet Christianity” seems to be a better way to go rather than being the guy publicly cheering on the “losing” squad week after week. Just as Paul told Timothy, so God’s Spirit says to us today, “Take off that paper bag! Don’t you know who your Savior is? Don’t you know the victory He has won? Don’t be ashamed! He has overcome! \nToday let’s take courage and lay down our timidity toward the gospel. There is a world waiting to hear good news, and a victorious King enabling us to persevere to the victory. \nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

When you signed up, the name you wanted was already taken, so you came up with something close. Your usual password wasn’t secure enough, so you added some strange character at the end. Now you can’t recall either your username or password. The irony is these were supposed to protect sensitive information, but now not even you can get to it. Is this what is means to guard something? Sure, you kept your sensitive data out of the hands of criminals. Good job. But you also kept it from yourself. \nPaul tells Timothy to guard the gospel. What does this mean? \nTo guard the gospel is not only to discern and object to false teachings that might seek to undermine God’s truth, it is also to become intimately familiar with that truth ourselves. To guard the gospel is to know it—to see through the lens of it, to be increasingly aware of where we stand in relationship to God because of it. The gospel is more than a set of doctrinal distinctions—it is the truth of our relationship with the living Christ who loved us, and gave Himself for us (Galatians 2:20). \nPaul says the gospel is a heritage entrusted to Timothy, meaning it didn’t begin with Timothy or Paul, nor with any of us the day we first believed. Christians have a great spiritual heritage. Paul traces both his and Timothy’s spiritual lineage, saying the God he serves is the God of his forefathers—the same as the God of Abraham, whom Paul grew up studying as a Jew. Paul’s present conversion was a matter of recognizing God’s perfect fulfillment of His ancient covenant promises to Abraham in Christ.\nLater, Paul instructs Timothy to “rekindle the gift of God that is in you” (2 Timothy 1:6). Why would Paul tell Timothy to fan the call to gospel faithfulness into flame? Is it dying inside Timothy? No. Paul tells him this because the gospel is not something we embrace once and then leave alone like some username and password. We take it up, tend to it like a fire, and study it to learn of God’s grace and ponder Christ’s life, death, and resurrection. Though its power is already perfectly complete in Christ, we still need to hear it daily. \nThis is how we guard the gospel. We internalize it.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In his play Hamlet, Shakespeare’s Polonius famously declares: “This above all: to thine own self be true.” The phrase has its appeals, and at first glance seems like wise counsel. In fact, it appeals to something we are all naturally drawn to: a devotion to self, to our own sense of honor, to our own interests, often at the expense of genuine wisdom and careful consideration. We live in a “believe in yourself” world that tells us everything of value—everything worth doing—begins and ends with self. \nAs Paul reminds Timothy, however, though the idolatry of ego comes naturally to us, it is antithetical to the honor of God. Indeed, he says, one who is self-indulgent is dead, even while he lives. And, contrary to popular belief, the philosophy of self-focus and self-fulfillment is no barrier against abuse, favoritism, partiality, and all other societal ills. Fulfilling Paul’s injunction to show no favoritism can only be done when we honor God as God, and see ourselves not as victims who need to stand up for our own needs and wants, but as servants to one another, and to His kingdom.\nAt the center of this passage is an outward-looking vision: a concern for the kingdom, for the purity of the Church and the honor of God’s name. It is full of warnings against being caught up in worldly concerns that might overshadow and compromise the witness of the faith: maintain pure relationships in the household of God; support of those in need, but do not support idleness; honor those who have undertaken the care of the flock; do so without prejudice; and even, servants honor your masters, so that God’s name may not be blasphemed. Servants, honor your masters? How contrary this runs to all the wise counsel of our day!\nWe like to think that if we muster enough self-will and self-confidence, and if we all try really hard together, we can fix the ills of our world. As it turns out, however, the gospel is the only practical means by which hearts, lives, communities, and the world can be changed. No matter how many plans for social change man may offer, none can effectively change the world, because none can effectively change the human heart. \nThe life of the Church, therefore, must be among our chief concerns. There, in worship, we meet Christ. In the life of the body, we grow in Christ through the fellowship of the saints. Both judgment and blessing begin at the household of God. He enacts the extension of His kingdom through the Church, which is His body here on earth. Therefore, we must not be self-indulgent, or we are dead even while we live. Rather, we are to rest wholly upon Christ as we walk. He must be our chief desire, the fulfillment of our hearts, and the shaper of our lives.\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n                ",

I never used much bad language when I was a kid, so this was the first and only time I had to wash my mouth out with soap. Needless to say, it made an impact.\nI was running up the basement stairs after competing in some meaningless sport or other activity with my younger brother when I yelled down at him (apologies for the language), “Kyle, you are p$&%#ing me off!” I’d learned the phrase from a neighborhood kid a number of years older than me. I didn’t know what it meant, but I knew it was something you yelled at people when you were mad at them.\nThe neighborhood kid was not setting a good example in speech for me, his young friend. Unfortunately, we Christians often don’t do our part to set good examples for others in our lives either. Depending on how we are wired, most of us tend either toward legalism or licentiousness. That is to say, some Christians lean more toward pridefully following the rules, and some lean toward pridefully pushing the limits of what is allowed in our speech, our conduct, or otherwise.\nThankfully, as followers of Jesus, we know and must remind each other that our works do not save us. We rely on the grace of God in Christ alone to save us from our sin. But this glorious truth does not exempt us from living lives worthy of our salvation, setting good examples for all with whom we come in contact. First Timothy 4:12 says, “Set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.” \nPractically speaking, what does this look like in our lives? It means we can’t beat ourselves up for not being shining examples of righteousness in every moment. But it also means we should seek to live lives worthy of Christ. Setting an example for others in our conduct really comes down to being mindful of our surroundings and our calling as Christians: to die to ourselves, sacrificing our perceived freedoms to become more like Jesus, walking in the freedom that can only come from knowing Him. \nAs we walk with Christ, we look to God’s Word to see how He conducts Himself, how He speaks, and how He lives, with the goal of imitating Him, by the power of the Holy Spirit.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I have a difficult time keeping surprises under wraps. I often give my children hints as to what their birthday and Christmas gifts will be. Even worse, my wife and I have a history of revealing gifts for one another before the proper time. There is excitement in knowing that giving the gift will result in bringing joy to the receiver—it’s almost too much to bear. Especially when the receiver is someone I love dearly.\nIt is no surprise that Paul exudes joy when he declares that “the mystery of godliness is great” (1 Timothy 3:16). The entirety of world history is riddled with religions where godliness is not a gift to be received, but a wage to be earned. It is staggering to think that millions of people have religiously worked throughout their lives to earn the title of “godly.” But the gospel, a gift from our good Father, explodes with earth-shattering news for weary people like you and me.\nAccording to Paul, godliness is not something we earn; it is a gift we receive. And at the right time, Jesus Christ came to offer this gift to those He dearly loves. In his letter to the Ephesians, the Apostle Paul declares,  “For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift—not from works, so that no one can boast” (Ephesians 2:8-9). This is the mystery of godliness! This is the content of the previously hidden, unwrapped gift. The gospel is God’s greatest gift to us, finally revealed: His plan for salvation through Jesus Christ.\nOne of the beautiful truths about this gift is that God gives us hints of it in every human heart. If anyone has ever tried to earn the title “godly” by their religious works, I would wager that deep down inside they know they do not measure up. There is the ever-present reminder of our failure. However, the mystery of godliness from the gospel brings a deep inner peace and joy that religious work cannot earn.\nIn this sense, “the mystery of godliness” means more than the initial good news of salvation. This is a gift that keeps on giving. Every day the gospel provides both salvation from our sin and peace from our failed efforts, but also the motivation to pursue godliness by God’s power and not our own. Our godliness does not earn our salvation. Our godliness is evidence of our salvation. We don’t rely on our works for salvation; we trust in Christ’s perfect work on our behalf. This is great news!\nTo put it another way, godliness is evidence that we are in Christ. It comes freely, flowing from Christ’s work in us. Once we grasp the goodness of this gift, we should all have a difficult time keeping this mystery under wraps. Think about it: God holds out to us the greatest gift that we could ever imagine! Reach out and receive joy and peace forevermore.\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When I was in college a hurricane came through town and did a lot of damage. Roofs were stripped away by gale-force winds. Trees were toppled on homes and businesses. Some roads were closed for days. Afterward, I lived in a house with five other guys for days without power. It was all pretty exciting, really. Before the weather turned, I can remember waiting for the storm, but nothing was happening. We kept going outside, looking at the sky, but it was calm. All was quiet and peaceful, and we were disappointed.\nThere is a lot of teaching on prayer in 1 Timothy 2. Some of it is obvious. Other parts are challenging. Some is controversial. But there is one teaching here that, if we are not careful, we will pass by and miss something important.\nKeep in mind that Paul is mentoring Timothy, a young pastor. His letters to young Timothy are full of wisdom, instruction, commands, helpful advice, and encouragement. This is what you would expect from Paul, the older, more seasoned minister of the gospel, compared to one who was still a little wet behind the ears.\nRight before chapter 2 begins, Paul charges Timothy to hold on to his faith, to not be like others who have made a wreck of their faith. I mention this because the first words in this chapter are, “First of all, then…,” followed by instructions on prayer. And what is the end of those prayers? Why is this so important? So that we may “lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity” (v. 1).\nThink about that logic. \nHold onto the faith. Don’t shipwreck your life. You and your people need to pray for everyone so you may lead a quiet, peaceful life. \nWho teaches this? Most people teach that the way to an exciting life is not through quietly and prayerfully holding onto your faith. Most will teach you to live out loud for Jesus—to live boldly, implying that you need to make a ruckus for God. But Paul paints a different picture of what the prayers of a person of faith give us; those prayers lead to a quiet and peaceful life.\nQuiet and peaceful sound like nothing is happening. Quiet and peaceful sound boring, not exciting. Quiet can lead to a life in which, if excitement is the standard, disappointment is sure to follow. This can be hard for anyone who wants to live an exciting life. But for Christians, Paul seems to think link this quiet and peaceful life with godliness—with not wrecking our spiritual lives.\nWhy, though?\nBecause our culture and our flesh tell us that spirituality is where the action is. But Paul and the rest of the Scriptures show us that, as Eugene Peterson says, “Prayer gets us in on what God is doing.” The world is after action. God is after prayerful faith displayed in a quiet and peaceful life.\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Christians love dramatic testimonies. We’ve all been moved by brothers and sisters who tell stories of unfathomable sin and brokenness before coming to Christ. Many of these narratives move in excruciating detail through the kind of pain and wickedness some of us have only heard about second-hand. But the implication of their testimonies is clear: “If God can save someone like me, He can save you, too.”\nBut what about brothers and sisters who seem to have “boring” testimonies? What about those who grew up in a home where their parents loved them and told them about Jesus from the day of their birth? Almost with a sense of shame at the simplicity of it, they confess they knew they needed to be saved when they were young, trusted in Jesus, and have followed Him since. They might say they don’t even remember life before becoming a Christian. Compared to the stories of fights, drugs, and prison, these testimonies might seem lackluster. \nWriting in the early 1700s to give testimony to the amazing work of revival happening in his town, Jonathan Edwards spoke about two women with very different testimonies. One was a “company-keeper,” an 18th-century term for living a notorious life, and the other a four-year-old girl named Phoebe. Both came to see their desperate need for Christ and were gloriously saved. Edwards used their examples to make a simple point: No matter what a person’s background may be, we all need grace.\nPaul makes this point through the example of his own testimony in 1 Timothy chapter 1. He looked back at his life before the Damascus Road, and even though he was a “Pharisee of Pharisees” and a “Hebrew of Hebrews,” he had also been a “blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent” who “acted ignorantly in unbelief.” After meeting Jesus, he looked at his present life and saw himself as someone who could never merit the favor of God because he was “the chief of sinners” (1Tm 1:12-20).\nYet, Paul saw something that was true about God much more clearly than he saw his own sin and unbelief: “The grace of our Lord overflowed” for him, as it does for us all. Paul pictured God’s grace as a mighty river, flowing toward him at a pace so fast and a force so strong that his own sin was no match for it. His sin and his self-righteousness had been overwhelmed “with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus” (1Tm 1:14).\nMany days, you will be tempted to think you have been so bad that grace could never reach you. Other days, the temptation will be to believe you’ve been so good that grace is beneath you. Therefore, on each and every day, take a long look toward the cross of Jesus Christ. There, you will remember how desperately you needed grace, and hear the good news that God is glad to freely give it to you.\nIn the end, every Christian has the same testimony: I need Jesus. He has freely accepted me. His grace is more than enough to sustain me with hope and joy throughout my journey.\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    During a recent visit with my parents, I climbed into their attic and brought down a few boxes of old photos. They’d been up there for at least 20 years, maybe more. In one box, I found pictures of my parents in their early twenties. Every time I see pictures of them from before I was born, I wonder who they were. What did they love? How did they spend their time? What kept them up a night? What made them laugh? How did they get from there to here?\nTime is a funny thing. We tend to think of people in terms of who they are to us now. But everyone has a story, and none of them are simple. Those stories shape us into who we are. They shape what we care about. The Apostle Paul’s letters to Timothy and Titus bear this out.\nFirst and 2 Timothy and Titus are Paul’s last letters—his swansong. He writes to his young protégés with the maturity and resolve of a man who knows his end is near. But within Paul’s Spirit-led words, we see reminders of the apostle when he was young—little literary snapshots that take us back to the days when he opposed Christianity and persecuted the Church. We read about his calling to follow Christ and his fight to preserve doctrine that is pure and true. We see a web of relationships forged over the years—some broken, some thriving.\nThe words we read in these letters have a tremendous amount of history and context behind them. Though they are addressed to individuals, they were written for the sake of all Christians everywhere. For the young believers who will one day become old, these letters exist to guide them along a journey that is faithful and true to the heritage of the gospel of Christ.\nPaul says “the goal of our instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith” (1 Timothy 1:5). Here at the end of his life, Paul is seasoned in such a way that he knows what it takes to develop this sort of character. He is writing to a young pastor and congregation knowing what sort of training and trials most likely lie ahead for these Christians. Some of what lies ahead for them will be filled with joy; other parts will carry a lot of sorrow. But Paul’s primary concern in these letters is spiritual growth.\nOne goal of the Christian life is that we would grow and change—that we would become more like Jesus. As you read these letters, I pray the Lord would call to mind ways He has worked to make you more like Jesus. And may this time you spend in His Word add to that ongoing work.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

It’s usually the last part of my preparation for preaching each week. Oftentimes I feel like I’m just slamming the plane on the runway from about 15,000 feet; we eventually come to a stop, but it can be a bumpy landing before we do.\nMaybe the writer of Hebrews was familiar with this same feeling. After masterfully calling his listeners to not abandon following Christ, he seems to run off a hit-list of items he wanted to get in before he finished, but perhaps didn’t have the time to fully develop. These powerful last words, however, are instructive; they don’t need much explanation because they call us to a life of truly following Christ. This final list is a matter of living in light of having a far superior Savior in Jesus. The author’s conclusion brings us to the unchanging, glorious Savior and how we should live in light of His grace.\nWith Jesus as our unchanging Savior, we can love others well, serve the stranger, care for those suffering for the sake of the gospel, honor the institution of marriage, live simply, and show regard for those who communicate the gospel to us. Because Jesus is unchanging in His grace toward us, we can reject false teaching and bear up under suffering, while following and praying for our leaders, and continuing to do good as we have opportunity. Jesus’s faithfulness toward us assures us that He will work these good things in us and through us.\nIn this final passage of Hebrews, we are met with a powerful reflection on the enduring faithfulness of Christ to us. Only through the grace of God and the constancy of Christ—who is the same yesterday, today, and forever—are we redeemed from our sins and empowered to live for God’s glory. \nThis exhortation we have been reading the last few weeks is a powerful call to be men who have our lives centered and focused on Christ. This kind of life is one of faith, love, and glory, where we trust God’s promises over what we can see. \nMay we always put our hope in the eternal Savior who is superior in every way.\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

It is true that “God is love” (1 John 4:8), but it is also true that “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom” (Proverbs 9:10).\nOne of the starkest reminders of the danger of rejecting God’s grace is found in the case of Esau. You’ll remember that in a moment of weakness and extreme hunger, Esau sold his birthright as the eldest son to his younger brother Jacob. To make matters worse, he sold it for a cup of stew (Genesis 25:27–34).\nWhile I know Esau acted rashly and unwisely, there’s a part of me that’s always felt sorry for him. Did he really understand what he was giving away? Surely, he must have. Yet he was willing to forsake all of his inheritance, his rights, his future lands, and his stake in the family name in exchange for instant gratification. There’s some significant personal irresponsibility here. Certainly, when he had a full belly and came to his senses, Esau must have realized the massive mistake he made. Yet it was too late to turn things around (Hebrews 12:17).\nThe writer of Hebrews issues a strong caution, one that was meant to rouse the attention of his first-century readers, and still causes us to do a double take today. His words about Esau are stern: “For you know that later, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, even though he sought it with tears, because he didn’t find any opportunity for repentance” (Hebrews 12:17).\nWhile the Father’s heart is loving, lavish, and long-suffering toward us, Hebrews 12 reminds us that we should not play fast and loose with those luxuries. Paul puts it another way, “What should we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may multiply? Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it?” (Romans 6:1–2).\nGod’s grace comes freely, but it’s not cheap. If you’ve handed your life over to God through Jesus, you’ve found freedom, but it was bought for a price. The writer of Hebrews expresses an important corrective to two different types of readers. The first is the person who has heard the invitation to salvation but, for whatever reason, hasn’t made the leap of faith yet. The second is the reader who knows Jesus but is consistently eyeing the ways of the world, wondering if there might be something better, more fulfilling “over there.”\nPerhaps you find yourself in one of those places today—unsure of the invitation to repentance and restoration, or perhaps not as enamored with the Christian life as you once were. Wherever you stand, the writer of Hebrews brings a loving challenge today: God is loving, compassionate, and generous, but it’s not wise to play with fire. Once you’ve tasted the goodness of God, be sure not to reject His loving redemption.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The Beverly Hillbillies was a 1960s sitcom about the Clampett family: a poor, backwoods family who lived in the Ozark mountains. While out hunting for dinner, family patriarch, Jed Clampett, fires his rifle at an animal and accidentally strikes oil. That oil comes bubbling up from the ground, and they realize their property is an oil field. So overnight, they go from dirt-poor to filthy rich, their wealth literally pouring out from the dirt. And then the rest of the series is about these backwoods hillbillies moving to luxurious Beverly Hills and being totally out of place there.\nNow, some prosperity gospel, health-and-wealth preachers might say this is the normal Christian life. If you’re dirt poor, just have faith, keep believing, support their ministry, and eventually you’ll strike it rich—God will give you all the money and stuff you could ever want. But that’s not Jesus’s story as told in our passage today. Hebrews 12 is a reminder that Jesus Himself suffered, and it is a call to endure the hardship, struggle, and discipline that will surely come when we follow Him.\nJesus would have been the worst prosperity preacher of all time: He left the riches of heaven to enter the poverty of this world. Being determined to do His Father’s will all the way to the cross meant He had few friends, no permanent home, and a ministry that went from thousands of cheering admirers to even His closest friends abandoning Him in His hour of greatest need. No, Jesus preaches a different kind of health and wealth. He promises not physical riches, but spiritual ones—eternal ones. \nThe gospel is not a promise of a full bank account; it’s a promise of heavenly riches even in earthly poverty. It’s a promise of life even in the face of death. Like Jesus, we are called to look suffering in the face and endure it with joy. In Him, we don’t merely survive suffering, we overcome it. \nThe truth is, we’re all spiritual Clampetts. We’re dirt-poor misfits who become filthy rich: our riches come up from the dirt of death to the abundance of resurrection life. Our residence in God’s Kingdom may seem as unlikely as hillbillies in Beverly Hills, but our citizenship and inheritance have been secured by Christ (Philippians 3:20, 1 Peter 1:3-4). \nHear the good news today: our suffering is no surprise to God, and in His kindness it is not wasted. He refines us in love, “so that we can share his holiness” (Hebrews 12:10). In our struggle, we can look to Jesus, who endured the cross and sent us the Holy Spirit to strengthen our weak hands and wobbly knees. May our own endurance be for His glory. \nWritten by Brandon D.

All those great players, all those great teams; it’s a glorious place for a basketball fan to visit. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame would be pretty cool to see too. Out of the great many singers and bands who have risen up the charts, only a select few make into the Hall. But enough Hall of Fame talk, because Hebrews 11 isn’t really a Hall of Fame or a Hall of Faith, despite it sometimes being described that way. Let’s put a cease-and-desist order on that.\nHalls of Fame are meant to separate the greats from the not-greats, the famous from the ordinary. No one visits the Basketball Hall of Fame and walks away thinking he can imitate Wilt Chamberlain’s 100-point game, or Yao Ming’s 7’6” height, or Michael Jordan’s gravity-defying dunks. You leave a Hall of Fame in awe of their greatness, not hoping to imitate what you see. But that’s not the point the writer of Hebrews is making.\nHebrews 11 exists for your imitation. God didn’t give us this section of the Bible for us to think, Look at these great followers of God. Too bad I’ll never be like them. The barrage of “by faiths” in the chapter are meant to weave us together with these Bible characters, joining us with them in the unfolding story of God’s glory. Like these saints of old, we, too, can walk by faith. God did great things through them, and He can do great things through us too. \nIn other words, Hebrews 11 doesn’t exist to museumify those who came before us. It is there to motivate and encourage us to believe that if these folks could live by faith, so can we. We know the crucified and risen Christ too. We’ve been joined to Him by faith, and we can walk through our temptations, sufferings, and joys, looking to Him. So go ahead and plant that church, start that Bible study at your office, invite your Muslim coworker over for dinner. Do it all by faith, trusting God to lead you and help you each step of the way.  \nOur biblical ancestors show us that by faith we, too, can endure and walk with God. We can look to the crucified and risen Lord Jesus and endure with Him till the end. There’s a great cloud of witnesses, testifying that faith is what we need to follow Jesus. So whatever lies ahead of you today or tomorrow, go by faith in the gospel of grace.\nWritten by Jeff Medders\n\n                ",

I wanted the best computer so I could beat the best players online. Sometime during middle school, my parents finally decided we needed a new family computer, and I was ecstatic because I knew it would be able to play a bunch of new games our old one couldn’t. This was before two-day Amazon delivery, and it felt like I waited months for the UPS man to drop off our new computer, when it really only took a week or two. I was hoping and waiting with eager anticipation for that computer to come. Some days I wondered if it ever would. My faith wavered.\nIn Hebrews 11, we find a beautiful, brief definition of faith, and then a handful of examples of people from the Bible who demonstrated faith. Because Hebrews 11 strikes such a victorious chord of triumphant faith, it’s tempting to read through the chapter spending most of our time admiring these faithful followers of God and their tremendous acts of faith. Reading about them can be faith-building, but I want to focus on the first two verses of the chapter, which are foundational to understanding faith, though sometimes overlooked.\nVerses 1–2 say, “Now faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen. For by it our ancestors won God’s approval.” These verses, especially verse one, can seem a bit cryptic. What does the author mean by “the reality of what is hoped for” or “the proof of what is not seen”? How is faith “reality” or “proof”?\nIn his commentary on Hebrews, Be Confident: Live by Faith, Not by Sight, Warren Wiersbe writes, “True Bible faith is confident obedience to God’s Word in spite of circumstances and consequences.” God has spoken to us through His Word about things both seen and unseen, and faith is trusting that what He says is true, especially about the things we can’t see. His Word describes “reality,” and is all the “proof” we need to believe. \nThe entire Christian life is meant to run on faith, not sight. We read that God’s approval is “won” by faith (v.2), and that “without faith it is impossible to please God” (v.6). Why does faith matter so much to God? Because our faith brings Him glory. When we take Him at His word, He shows Himself faithful and accomplishes His will through us. The Scriptures testify again and again that walking by faith is part of the normal Christian life. It isn’t just for elite Christians, but for all Christians, including you and me.   \nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

It was a surreal experience for me to see our local college team. I was a big fan. Let’s face it; I’m still a big fan! But what made this day unforgettable was that we had all-access tickets. My friend’s uncle, who worked for the visiting school’s football program, had asked him to come and be a ball boy on the sidelines. I didn’t get to carry equipment and meet players like my friend did (I’m still a little jealous), but we did get free tickets and the chance to see the locker room before the game.\nI can remember approaching the security guard outside the locker room door. My friend’s uncle simply said, “They’re with me,” and just like that, we were in.\nDo you know what’s more incredible than an all-access ticket to a football game? Hebrews tells us that we can boldly enter into the very presence of God. In today’s passage, we read:\n“Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water. Let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, since he who promised is faithful” (Hebrews 10:22–23).\nIf we’re with Jesus, we can confidently draw near to God in worship, prayer, and communion. His new covenant sacrifice has washed us clean. So, we can walk right in. \nCan you imagine if my friend and I had tried to get into that locker room without his uncle? The security guard would’ve turned us right around. The same is true for those who approach God apart from Christ. Hebrews tells us that Jesus’s sacrifice is the only way we can be saved. If we reject Christ and go on deliberately and defiantly sinning, even after learning the truth of the gospel, we’ll find ourselves out of options (v.26). Judgment is coming for all. And if we’re not with Jesus, entering into God’s presence at the judgment will be a fearful thing. The author of Hebrews states it plainly: \n“It’s a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God” (v.31). \n\nBeing with the Savior or without Him makes all the difference. This is so important to remember—especially when difficulty comes and our faith is tested. The church to which the author of Hebrews wrote had experienced conflict, suffering, public insults, imprisonment, and the confiscation of their property (vv.32–34). They endured all this hardship because they knew that with Christ there are better and more lasting rewards. \nFriends, don’t throw away your confidence in Christ. Don’t throw away your credentials! Stay with Jesus, and one day you’ll be richly rewarded (v.35). Then, it will be said of you: “But we are not those who draw back and are destroyed, but those who have faith and are saved” (v.39).\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When work is done, we sit down. After a long day at the office, after tough yard work, there is nothing that says we’re finished like sitting down and resting. In fact, if you are like me, you might even get a little irritated when you need to get up again because there is something else to do. It seems like the work never ends, doesn’t it? I’ve often reflected on this reality when reading Hebrews 10:12, “But this man, after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God.”\nIn ancient Israel, the work of offering animal sacrifices seemed to have no end. The perpetual sacrifices offered by the priest for the forgiveness of the people’s sins were a continual reminder that more needed to be done. Since the people could not rid themselves of their sinfulness, the need for atoning sacrifices was always before them. There was no finality. There was no rest. There was no end in sight. For this reason, the writer of Hebrews reminds us that Jesus is the true and greater sacrifice for sin. In contrast to the priests who made daily sacrifices, “by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified” (v.14). \nAfter Jesus’s resurrection and ascension, He entered the presence of God and sat down, having completed His work. No more sacrifices are needed. There is nothing else to do for the forgiveness of sin. Jesus sits at the right hand of God reminding us that we are not saved by what we do, but by what He has done. Jesus is the Lamb slain for us. He has made peace between God and us. He has taken our guilt upon Himself. He has conquered sin and death. Jesus didn’t just die for us; He died instead of us—in our place.\nIf you are a Christian, remember that the shout from the cross, “It is finished” (John 19:30), wasn’t a cry of defeat but a declaration of victory. It is a victory cry because Jesus is seated on the throne, not buried in a tomb. Praise God that in Christ we have a perfect sacrifice for sin, and He is more than sufficient to save. And thus, the salvation offered by Christ is perfect in every way and eternal in its effect. But also remember that while He is seated now, there is coming a day when He will rise from His throne. Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead (2 Timothy 4:1). And on that day, every tongue will confess that He is Lord, either in thankfulness or in terror.\nUntil He rises to return, the question for all of us is this: Are we resting in the perfect work of Jesus Christ? The alternatives—running from God in rebellion, or working to earn God’s favor by our good behavior and religious activities—are exhausting, futile pursuits. The work is finished. Christ has done it. We can rest. \nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In a letter written to Jean-Baptiste Le Roy in 1789, Benjamin Franklin made the now famous statement: \n“Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” \nDeath is the inevitable end for each of us. For many, the thought of death is terrifying because our consciences bear witness to the truth that after we die there awaits a day of judgment in which we will be held accountable for all we have ever done. The Christian need not fear death, though. The Scriptures bear witness to the certainty of death and judgment in order to hold out hope for the forgiveness of sins through the death of the God-Man, Jesus Christ, and His subsequent return on the last day, when the dead in Christ are raised to new life in Him.\nThe writer of Hebrews emphasizes the greatness of the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. When contrasting it with the weakness of the old covenant’s sacrificial system, the writer highlights the need for the continual sacrificing of calves and goats. The repetition of these sacrifices indicated that sin remained. If these sacrifices had been able to permanently take away sin, they would have ceased. By contrast, “[Jesus] has appeared one time, at the end of the ages, for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself” (Hebrews 9:26). He cannot and will never need to be re-sacrificed. There is permanence to the one sacrifice of Christ on the cross for the sins of His people.\nIn order to drive home the point of the one-time, definitive nature of Jesus’s sacrificial death on the cross, the writer explains the mechanics of death and redemption. He sums up the history of redemption in the following way: “And just as it is appointed for people to die once—and after this, judgment—so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him” (Hebrews 9:27–28). The one-time, definitive sacrifice of Jesus secures resurrection glory for His people when Jesus returns.\nThis precious truth has huge implications for our souls today. When we look to the crucified Son of God, we are assured that He has fully paid for our sins. They all have been nailed to the cross—nothing more is required. His one-time sacrifice for sin means we need not fear death and judgment. For the believer, there is nothing more sure than the finished work of Christ on the cross, and His coming again in glory for our salvation. This gives us great encouragement and strength to persevere with hope.\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

Because of our age gap, Bill could tell me stories about growing up in Detroit and going to the old Tiger Stadium at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull avenues. His eyes would light up when he told me about the character of the stadium and the historic events he’d witnessed there. He would say that, in some ways, Tiger Stadium was a sacred place to him. When we would talk about the modern-era Tigers and the new Comerica Park, Bill’s eyes didn’t light up in that same way. For Bill, there was something special about the old park that retained its grandeur even after its glory had long passed.\nThe first recipients of the sermonic letter we call Hebrews seemed to have a similarly nostalgic perspective on the ministry of the priests at the temple. To them, the temple was the prescribed place of worship, and the priests were responsible servants to help them clear their consciences. But the writer of Hebrews contends that the old temple, and the old practices of the temple, were just a “symbol” (Hebrews 9:9) that pointed to the more glorious and better ministry of Christ.\nWhile the priests of the old order had to offer sacrifices on an annual basis to cleanse the consciences of sinful people, Jesus’s ministry as a priest is far greater. Instead of having to offer a sacrifice once a year before God, Christ has entered the presence of God by His own cross to obtain eternal redemption, purification, and life, so that we can serve God faithfully (vv.12–14). He stands as the one who, by His sacrificial death, perfectly represents us before God so that we receive all the blessings of God in Him. \nAnd yet, there still can be times when we’re tempted to go back to some of the things we did before we came to know Christ. We look at the supposed freedom we had before following Christ and long for easier days. Like the first readers of Hebrews, we can be deceived into thinking that the hardships that come with following Christ validate our stepping back into our former way of life. There are all kinds of pulls for our hearts to believe that the old way, the old place, the old worship was better than what we have now.\nBrothers, let it sink into your heart that “the good things that have come” (v.11)—the good life—is only found in Christ. So let’s fix our eyes on Him and not turn back.  \nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

Much of our international politics in the twenty-first century is predicated on this kind of thinking. Heads of state put aside differences and extend either explicit or implicit forgiveness to their global allies, enemies, and neighbors. Yet, they don’t completely forget their ideological differences and past conflicts. \nOn an interpersonal level, wrongs and wounds are also complicated to resolve. All of us have been in situations, probably even this week, where we’ve been hurt by others or we’ve hurt others. While these times are not representative of us at our best, they are regular occurrences in our post-Genesis 3 world and impact how we relate to one another.\nThe writer of Hebrews continues to explain how Jesus is our Great High Priest, far exceeding all who came before Him. He is a better mediator of a superior covenant between God and humanity. In stark contrast to the uneasy covenants, shaky treaties, and tentative agreements that govern our world and relationships, the covenant God establishes with us through Jesus is solely dependent upon the power and goodness of one party, and that party is not us but God. Though we frequently, consistently, and brazenly sin against God, He frequently, consistently, and tenderly forgives us on account of Christ’s atoning sacrifice for our sins. \nGod also “forgets” our sins in the sense of choosing not to remember them. There’s no lingering grudge, ongoing distrust, or probationary period with God. He does not drag up the past. The slate has been wiped clean—completely clean. David captured this amazing reality in vivid, memorable language in Psalm 103: “As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us” (v.12). Our sins have been removed an infinite distance from us so that God could move intimately close to us. \nWe tend to have short memories when it comes to remembering God’s mercy and forgiveness. But if we’ve come to know God through Jesus, then God is actually the one with the short memory. For He promises, “I will remember their sins no more” (Hebrews 8:12). He chooses not to look at us and see our sin. Thanks be to God for His unending mercy and grace. \nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    We’re all tempted to be on the lookout for items that are “new and improved.” We can easily become enamored with appliances promising additional conveniences, cars loaded with luxury options, houses that include energy-efficient features, or cell phones with the latest upgrades. But we know from experience that the latest and greatest updates do not always match their promotional hype. Newer is not always better.\nNevertheless, the possibility of occasional letdowns does not discourage us from taking advantage of significant leaps in technology. We know that advances in science and industry do lead to some wonderful inventions. An automobile is better than a horse and buggy, steel-toed work boots provide much more support and protection than primitive sandals, a phone is a much quicker way to contact someone than the Pony Express, and thanks to anesthetics, surgery today is much more bearable than in centuries past. So, while the claims for the latest “life-changing” product deserve a certain level of scrutiny, there are many instances where the claims have some truth to them. \nThroughout Scripture, God institutes priests to make atonement for His people. Like us, they couldn’t shake their sin no matter how hard they tried. A priest represented the people for the Lord in helping remove the weight of sin through the sacrificial system God commanded. As the Israelites wandered in the wilderness in the book of Numbers, Aaron was first appointed to carry this mantle of the priesthood. In places like Zechariah 6, we see the Israelites longing for the day when their final priest would come. God promised a newer and better covenant fulfilled by a new and better priest.\nIn Jesus, that promise of a new and better priest has come true. The priests of God throughout biblical history had a role to play, but were ultimately pointing forward to Jesus, who is both the final priest and the final sacrifice of the new covenant between God and man. As Hebrews 8:6 says, “Jesus has now obtained a superior ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises.”\nIn the case of Jesus, newer really is better. He has a superior ministry based on a better covenant and better promises. We don’t need to look around for a better sacrifice. We don’t need to search for a better salvation. We only need to look at Jesus, our risen Priest and King.\nWritten by Brandon Smith \n\n                ",

That Sunday morning’s topic escapes me. All I remember are three sentences uttered by the teacher. “Boys, one day you will die. If the good you have done outweighs the bad, you will get to go to heaven. If your bad outweighs the good, you will go to hell.”\nWords could not describe the sense of panic that set in as I attempted to do the math on how far behind I was. I figured I had done way more bad than good during the time I had lived, so it would take at least ten to twelve years of almost perfect living to catch up. Then I remembered how much I liked the bad things I did, so I wasn’t sure how I could turn things around. Plus, we learned in church that sin starts in the heart, so the bad things we think are sinful as well. I came to the inevitable conclusion that my situation was hopeless. Sadly, in my ponderings about my own sinfulness, lack of goodness, and eternal life, Jesus never crossed my mind.\nToday’s Scripture passages offer good news that destroys both our excessive guilt and our futile attempts at self-justification. In chapter 7, the writer of Hebrews argues for the superiority of Jesus’s priesthood (vv.11–28). It’s a different line of argument from the one he uses at other places in the book.\nThe author of Hebrews draws from Genesis 14 and Psalm 110 to show that Jesus is a great high priest after the order of Melchizedek. The priests under the Levitical priesthood could not continue in their service perpetually because death prevented them from doing so. However, since Christ lives forever, He fulfills the promise made through David in Psalm 110 that He would have an everlasting priesthood. In this way, “Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant” (Hebrews 7:22).\nIn other passages in Hebrews, the author shows that Jesus is a merciful and faithful high priest because He took on our humanity and can sympathize with our weaknesses. In chapter 7, he instead emphasizes Jesus’s perfect life as the qualification for His eternal priesthood. He stresses that Christ has no sins of His own to atone for, but rather He is “holy, innocent, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens” (v.26). Christ’s priesthood offers us hope because He lived a sinless life on our behalf and now sits at the right hand of God in His glorious perfection.\nJohn shows us in 1 John 2:1 why we should trust Christ, our Great High Priest. He says he was writing so they might not sin. He follows this with what I believe to be the most humorous conditional clause in all of Scripture: “But if anyone does sin… ” Not just “anyone” is going to sin. We all have sinned in serious and tragic ways. Yet John points us to our advocate before the Father, “Jesus Christ the righteous one,” emphasizing Christ’s perfect righteousness deliberately because His perfect righteousness is our only hope before a holy God.\nWe experience real guilt when we sin, and rightly so. We feel a separation from the Father and are tempted to shrink back from coming into His presence because of the weight of our sin. When that happens, we must look to Jesus, the perfect high priest and our righteous advocate. He gives us His righteousness so that we can stand before the Father knowing the same blessing and approval Jesus does.\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Back when I was starting to read deeply, I picked up a Hebrews commentary and read it straight through. That was my first time doing such a thing. Commentaries are not meant to be read like that. But such was my hunger in the face of my ignorance. I don’t remember much from that book, but I do remember one particular section that affected me.\nIn Hebrews chapter 6, the author connects the promise made to Abraham to the promise made to us in Christ. When I read that, and the notes on that passage, I was undone. It was like that moment when you have all the puzzle pieces in front of you, and they finally begin to make sense. When God made the promise to Abraham, He swore by the highest thing there was—Himself. He was the guarantee of His faithfulness to the promise made to Abraham. \nI can remember understanding for the first time that Christ gave His life for us because we weren’t faithful and had broken God’s covenant. Christ, who is God, not only kept covenant, but also died as a fully human representative for those who could not keep covenant. When I, as a young college student, saw that God in Christ was the guarantee of His love for us, my mind was blown. It changed everything.\nFast-forward twenty-plus years. What had blown my mind as a young man was beginning to penetrate my weary heart. Four in the morning was becoming a time I was well-acquainted with. And the fears and worries that reared their ugly heads the minute I awoke were also becoming unwelcome companions. In these times, my temptation is to make promises to God. If I’m fearful about one of my children, I make a promise to do better as a parent. If I’m worried about work, I try to bargain with God to secure His help with my job. I forget the promise that God has already made and kept, and this forgetfulness leads to a lack of hope. \nI’m someone who has every reason to hope but often forgets where hope lies. I keep living as if my hope is in what I do. My own works, and promises of more and better works, are far too often my hope and refuge at 4 a.m., and trust me, they bring no comfort. But when I can finally get a sane thought, I remember what I learned as a young man: “We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure“ (Hebrews 6:19).\nSleep doesn’t always come. But there is always rest when I place my hope in Him.\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I’ve been in two car accidents—both in parking lots. My depth perception, the blind spots, and the lack of beeping sensors on my truck are a recipe for me to back into cars and poles in a parking lot. My wife’s car has the warning lights. I love them. I miss them when I get in my truck. Her car warns you if someone is in your blind spot. It warns you if you are too close to a wall or another car in front. A backup camera and flashing lights alert you to what’s going on behind you. Warnings are gifts, and Hebrews 6 is a flashing light.\nThe writer of Hebrews is alerting this group of Jewish Christians to watch out for the temptation to go back to Judaism, thinking that Jesus isn’t really the Messiah. They are getting hung up on some of the basic teachings and hurdles they’ve already jumped. They don’t need to repent from the dead works of Judaism—they’ve already done that if they are in Christ (v.1). They don’t need another lesson on the place of cleansing rituals—they are already clean and righteous in Christ (v.2). But the lights are still flashing.\nApparently, some in their group had already turned away from Christ and gone back to Judaism. Even though they knew something of the freedom and joy that is offered in Christ, they ultimately rejected it. They didn’t really believe in Christ and the value of His crucifixion. Verse 6 puts it in stark terms: “To their own harm, they are recrucifying the Son of God and holding him up to contempt.” In their rejection of Christ, they were saying His crucifixion was deserved because He wasn’t really the sinless Son of God.\nNo genuine believer can imagine himself saying and believing such things. True Christians know Jesus didn’t deserve to be crucified—we did. He was crucified for our sins. He should not be mocked and held in contempt. God has highly exalted Him and given Him a name that is above every name (Philippians 2:9). He deserves worship and loyalty, not dishonor and rejection. \nDo you see what the writer of Hebrews is doing? He is warning the church that not everyone who appears to be a believer really is. Just because some people attend church for a time, or have some understanding of the gospel, doesn’t mean they have truly trusted in Christ for salvation. It’s the same in our churches today. \nSeeing some of their number depart from Christ was no doubt discouraging to these suffering believers, so he reminds them that “God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you demonstrated for his name by serving the saints—and by continuing to serve them” (Hebrews 6:10). God saw their faithfulness and perseverance, and He sees yours too. Whatever you are facing today—temptations, doubts, fears—let the reality of the risen Christ strengthen you. You will remain faithful to the end because Christ has already been faithful, and He promises to never leave you or forsake you.\nWritten by Jeff Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Several years ago, I attended a weekend conference on prayer led by an author who had recently written a book on the subject. I learned all sorts of helpful tips that weekend, but my biggest takeaway could be summed up as: Get in the game. Don’t just talk about prayer or think about prayer or wait until you have just the right system or motivation to pray, but actually begin praying in any and every situation you can. Don’t hold back. Pray often, pray honestly, pray imperfectly (which you will), but pray. Get in the game.\nChildren can lead the way here. Think about it: they ask for what they want, unconcerned with their motives or having just the right words or whether or not it’s a good time to be asking. They make their requests known, fully expecting their parents to be able to give them what they need or want. It’s no wonder Jesus said, “Don’t try to keep them from coming to me, because the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these” (Matthew 19:14). Jesus is not turned off by need and desire, but moves toward it.\nHebrews 4:14 describes Jesus as our “great high priest.” In the Old Testament, a priest served as a mediator between God and the people of God. This priest was human, of course, and so was weak and sinful, just like us. He knew what it felt like to desperately need God’s mercy and grace. As a fellow sinner, the offerings he made to God on behalf of the people were also made to cover his own sins. While he was called by God to represent the people, he was not above the people.\nJesus was also called by God to serve as our high priest. “He did not exalt himself” to that role (Hebrews 5:5). Because He lived a sinless life, His sacrifice was a sufficient and permanent offering to God. And yet His sinlessness does not mean He is unable to sympathize with us. He was “tempted in every way as we are” (Hebrews 4:15). And “during his earthly life, he offered prayers and appeals with loud cries and tears” (Hebrews 5:7). Jesus knows what it feels like to be human. He is our Great High Priest, but He has been in low places. He is not an unapproachable Savior.\nAnd so Hebrews 4:16 offers this exhortation and invitation: “Let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in time of need.” In light of who Jesus is (great, and sympathetic to our needs) and in light of what He has done (provided a permanent sacrifice for sin) we can and must approach God with unashamed boldness, fully expecting Him to give us the mercy and grace we need. He delights to do so, for He is a merciful and gracious God. \nWritten by Matt Erickson\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    This summer I endured one of the most stressful weeks of my life. We led a fun but exhausting youth retreat, I traveled for work, a close family friend passed away, one of our cars got a flat tire at a bad time, the other car was damaged in a hit-and-run the night before we were supposed to take it home for the funeral (and there weren’t any rentals available in town)—and the list goes on.\nIt was a rough week. But when we went home for the funeral, we had a couple of days of much-needed rest, and it felt like we had finally reached a quiet oasis in a desert of noise and stress.\nAs great as that felt, Hebrews 4 reminds us that in Christ we have a much greater rest than can be found in a quiet weekend away from the busyness of daily life. Scholars debate about what the author of Hebrews means by the “rest” found in Christ. Does it mean our rest in eternity? Does it mean rest from working for our salvation? Theologically, both are true, but the emphasis here seems to be on enjoying our future rest today. \nWe can find refuge and rest in the finished work of Christ today because we are not responsible for securing the salvation rest we will receive in eternity. Hebrews 4:10 says, “For the person who has entered his rest has rested from his own works, just as God did from his.” The only way we can enjoy the rest God wants to give us is to rest from our own works.  \nThe good news of the gospel is that all the work necessary for our salvation was completed by Jesus through His life, death, and resurrection. While we are called to lives of obedience to God’s Word, we are not called to live a life of anxious striving, desperately trying to obey God’s law in order to earn His love. Christ has done for us what we couldn’t do for ourselves. He has fulfilled the law perfectly on our behalf. We can rest in that. We must rest in that or have no rest at all.   \nThe grace of God is hard for us to understand. The idea that a reward as great as eternity in the presence of God would be granted to us with no consideration for whether or not we earned it is just plain hard for us to wrap our heads around. It seems too good to be true, which is precisely the point—God’s grace is meant to amaze us. We need faith to believe the gospel.  \nSometime soon, whether a Saturday morning, a night during the week, or perhaps on a day off, take some time to rest. And don’t just rest physically. Don’t just take a nap or leisurely work in your garden. Take some time to rest in the promise that your eternity is secure because of the finished work of Christ, not because of how obedient you’ve been. Repent of any and all self-salvation projects, believe the gospel afresh, and enjoy God’s rest in Christ. He’s earned it.  \nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

And to make matters worse, the letter came with a warning: if I didn’t pay up within a couple of weeks, I’d get a stiff penalty. Honestly, the letter left me confused. I’d used a reputable accountant. I’d filed my return weeks before. What could have caused me to owe so much? I double-checked my records, and the mistake was obvious; I had filed the return, but I’d forgotten to mail the check. \nI can laugh about it now, but that letter produced a lot of anxiety at the time. I don’t look forward to warning letters. If I’m honest, I don’t really like warnings. They’re not always positive and encouraging, but they’re necessary. I’d rather be warned than incur a steep penalty. \nThe author of Hebrews invites us to hear a needed warning today. He reminds us how the human heart is bent toward evil. Like the Israelites who longed to go back to Egypt (Exodus 16:3,17:3), our sinful hearts can delude us into thinking we’re more secure apart from God than we are walking with Him. We’ve got to watch out and guard ourselves against an “evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God” (Hebrews 3:12). \nThis passage in Hebrews 3 also tells us that we need our friends, wives, and church leaders to step in daily to tell us when we’re headed in the wrong direction. We are human, which means we’re also sinners. We forget to mail checks on time; we lose our keys; and we sometimes lose our cool. Maybe it’s easy to speak up when it’s something small. But when I see a brother who’s slandering his pastor or putting down his wife behind her back, am I tempted to think, Well, that’s his business, and just walk away?\nHebrews doesn’t let me off the hook so easily. It instructs us to encourage one another daily, so we’re not hardened by sin’s deception (v.13). And as we caution one another, we also inspire confidence, believing that all who keep holding on to the reality Christ gives us at the start will share in His eternal rest at the end (v.14).\nThe time for giving and receiving these warnings and encouragements is now. We must speak up and warn one another before it’s too late. If you see me headed in the wrong direction on a one-way street, please honk your horn! I need a course correction because I’m headed for destruction. The direction of our souls requires this same level of urgency. As Paul writes elsewhere, “Now is the acceptable time; now is the day of salvation!” (2 Corinthians 6:2). \nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

Those who have led through the unlikely and even seemingly impossible often stand out as examples of greatness among their peers.\nWhen you think of great leaders, who comes to mind? Most of us would think of a political leader or a CEO or a famous coach. There are plenty of good options to choose from. For an ancient Israelite, though, it would have been difficult to think of anyone greater than Moses. If you read through Exodus, you’ll understand why.\nGod used Moses to miraculously deliver Israel from Egyptian slavery, even though Moses initially showed reluctance based on his feelings of inadequacy to perform such a task. Moses wasn’t the greatest speaker. What were the odds that he, an Israelite, would be able to persuade Pharaoh, the god-king of Egypt to bend to his request? It seemed like an unlikely mission at best, and would certainly require divine intervention to succeed.\nGod did intervene. While Moses was the chosen human instrument through which God would act to bring His people out of slavery, ultimately it was God’s power that secured freedom for the Israelites. God demonstrates throughout the Bible that He is a great rescuer and redeemer. Redemption as a release from the slavery of sin is one of the most often used metaphors for salvation in Scripture. \nAs the book of Hebrews reminds us, all the key events in Scripture, like the exodus, and even the great leaders of God’s people, like Moses, point to someone much greater. In Hebrews, we are reminded that Jesus is much greater than Moses, and He led His people out of a slavery far worse than that which was imposed by Egypt; we had been held captive under the slavery of sin and death until Christ set us free.\nFor this reason, Jesus is the pioneer of our salvation, our redemptive forerunner and representative. He leads us out of slavery to sin and death toward a greater promised land, the presence of God. Jesus forged a new path; in fact, He is the new path. He says, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6), and calls us to trust Him and follow Him. \nThroughout the Bible, we are reminded again and again that God delivers His people. The book of Hebrews shows us that Jesus provides the ultimate deliverance the Scriptures have been pointing to all along. And so, we can say with the prophets and the writer of Hebrews, “Again, I will trust him” (2:13), knowing that “every one of God’s promises is ‘Yes’ in him” (2 Corinthians 1:20).\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

After all, who in his right mind would want to sit as far away from the field as possible? I do, however, have an appreciation for the aerial shots of a televised football game. Such shots tend to put the biggest and strongest athletes in perspective—they’re still relatively small. \nIn Psalm 8, David—who seems to have had a keen eye for the book of nature, which was perhaps strengthened from his days as a shepherd—contrasted mankind with the majesty of the heavenly bodies: “When I observe your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you set in place, what is a human being that you remember him, a son of man that you look after him?” (vv.3–4).There is perhaps nothing so effective at reminding us of our insignificance as looking up at the starry skies. Both their vast distance away and their glory leave us awestruck. We are so small and insignificant by comparison.\nThough we are so much smaller, so much less glorious than the night sky, the psalmist, speaking of God’s assessment of man, goes on to say, “You made him little less than God and crowned him with glory and honor. You made him ruler over the works of your hands; you put everything under his feet” (vv.5–6). It is absolutely astonishing—even after the fall—the sorts of things God allows man to accomplish. We have built cities, developed amazing technologies, and even discovered cures for some diseases. These are, in small part, a picture of what it means for man to have dominion over creation.\nNevertheless, men still die in fires, while at sea, and occasionally even by wild animal attack. Since the  fall of Adam, man has not been able to fully exercise dominion over this world for the glory of God. The writer of Hebrews, picking up on the teaching of Psalm 8, puts it this way: “As it is, we do not yet see everything subjected to him” (Hebrews 2:8). He then adds, “But we do see Jesus—made lower than the angels for a short time so that by God’s grace he might taste death for everyone—crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death” (v.9). Though the kingdom of God has come, it is not yet fully here. Sin remains in the world, and our dominion is limited until Christ returns. \nIn the meantime, we wait with hope, looking to Jesus, the One who has already conquered sin and death. We know that when He returns, we will reign with Him for all eternity. That is our sure future. Our ultimate significance is found not in what we can accomplish in this life, but in our union with Christ now and forevermore.   \nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

First, I love the poetry of the line. It’s a beautifully crafted statement and image—lyrical, ironic, forthright, and severe. The entire book is this way—filled with imagery, concepts, warnings, and encouragement that read like poetic meditations on glorious and fearful things.\nAlso, I love how the line frames the holiness of God and our need for redemption, another theme that runs throughout the book. This is a beautiful, powerful, sometimes terrifying book if you read it without humility, reverence, and a sense of awe before the Lord.\nBut if you read it with humble eyes and an open heart, you’ll find Hebrews fights for our hearts. It lifts our eyes up from our present struggles—and in the case of the original audience, from persecution—to consider the eternal glory and majesty of Christ and to find our hope there.\nThis letter was written to Christians with Jewish roots. They were being persecuted for their faith, and many were wondering if it was worth it to continue to claim the name of Christ. To these people facing these struggles, the author clearly says, “Long ago God spoke to the fathers by the prophets at different times and in different ways. In these last days, he has spoken to us by his Son. God has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him” (Hebrews 1:1–2).\nYou’ll notice as you read that the author threads this letter with dozens of references to the Old Testament. He does this to demonstrate that everything the Hebrew people’s forefathers believed in and hoped for has been fulfilled in Christ. And Christ will finish the saving work He began. Where else can they go? To what else can they cling?\nThe power and supremacy of Christ described in this letter would cause any of us to tremble in His presence. It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God. But to adapt a phrase from the disciple Peter, where else should we fall? He alone has the words of life. May the daily Scripture readings in this study plan challenge you, inspire you, correct you where needed, and deepen your confidence in God’s ability and resolve to rid the world of all evil and make all things new. \nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    We spend our time in this life waiting for the Lord’s return. But we do not wait idly. We’re given work to do—kingdom work. One of the unique works that Christians are called to is caring for one another over time. In today’s reading, James gives us some instructions on how to do that. In particular, I want to focus on this strange little practice of anointing the sick with oil. What is that about?\nMany churches today practice anointing the sick with oil. And based on James 5, all churches should.\nJames charges elders to gather to pray for the sick and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. His explanation of this practice is very abbreviated. We’re given only a few specifics—elders, sick people, oil, and prayer. Regardless of how well we understand it, James gives the instruction, so we must seek to understand what it means.\nJames tells us the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective—or in the old language, it availeth much. I am convinced that in matters such as these, the Lord is as interested in what He is doing in the lives and hearts of His church leaders as He is in the bodies of the sick. God calls the leadership of the church to complete and pure reliance upon His grace and power to redeem and restore our fallen world and broken bodies.\nThe oil is not magic, and neither is prayer. We know anointing with oil is not a “sign-gift” given only to healers, because James does not call on those with a special gift of healing to pray. He calls the elders of the church to do it. Ordinary people. In humble reliance upon God’s grace and sober submission to His perfect will, elders pray for the sick in the name of Jesus, our Great Physician, in the hope that God will heal the person they love, here and now.\nSinclair Ferguson, in his book The Holy Spirit, summarizes this hope:\nNo right-thinking Christian would deny that God continues to be active in the world, to do wonderful things for His people, and especially to answer their prayers in keeping with His promises. It is still appropriate for the sick not only to consult a doctor but to “call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord”. The promise remains that “the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up” (James 5:14-15). People continue to be healed by God — through, above, and even against means.\nIf any are suffering with serious illness, the elders of the church are called to come to them, pray for them, and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, believing His promises are true, His power is strong, and His love is abounding in grace.\nWhen we observe this practice, we’re praying for the Lord’s gospel to be proclaimed, for His Holy Spirit to be present, and for His glory to be revealed. And we boldly ask for a miracle, all the while praying as our Lord Jesus taught us, “not my will, but yours be done on earth as it is in heaven”—all by the grace of God and all for His glory. This is part of what it means to wait on the Lord.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

A lot.\nAnd while this text could be read to a general audience, there is a specific group the writer had in mind: the rich. Or as one translation puts it, “the arrogant rich.” Their continued stockpiling of wealth with no concern, much less thought, for the hearts and minds and souls and strength of the little people who were used and abused to make such wealth a reality, is a telling indication of whose the rich are not. If they were God’s people, they would act differently.\nMost of us are, to some degree, the little people. So we raise a fist and cry, “You tell ‘em, James,” to which James responds, “I will. But hey, don’t forget the other texts for today, okay?” Sigh. Thanks a lot, James. For now we see that we, too, can be the arrogant rich. While God has very direct things to say with regard to endlessly amassing wealth, God also speaks equally direct things into other areas of our lives where we are to act differently because of whose we are.\nThe spirit found in James and his fellow writers is one of living generously, open-handed and open-hearted—embarrassingly so. Because of our identity in Christ, the singular thing we should expend any effort toward stockpiling on this earth is what we’ve been given: mercy. Now that can work itself out not in building bigger barns, but instead building better childcare. Or turning the other cheek, standing there and taking it like a man who knows the sting of mercy. Or staying loyal to those friends persecuted or imprisoned for their faith when the safest thing would be to turn tail and run away fast.\nWhose we are is of the utmost importance in this life, because this identity drives both our words and actions. And those deeds matter. \nMercy, do they ever matter. A lot.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    The older I get, the more I realize how little I know. Each season and event in my life seems to usher me into a world far larger than the world I thought I knew. Certainties give way to questions. Sureties sink under the weight of wonder. I just don’t have the grip on things like I once thought I had.\nThere is no place this is more evident than when considering the future. When I was young, I was sure of a number of things. I was sure about how I would live, how I would raise my kids, and what my vocation would be. But in reality, so many things go the way we plan, and this fact has a habit of humbling us as the years go by. It’s enough to make us laugh at ourselves when we’re done with the tears.\nI read James’s statement—about how we do not know what tomorrow will bring—differently as a 45 year old man than I did as a 25 year old. Back then, I looked sideways at his declaration as harsh and unnecessary. After all, everyone tells others about their plans for the following day when asked. What’s the big deal?\nBut now I get it. We really have no idea what is coming, though we think we know so much and have so much control. James is helping us recalibrate what is at stake in our arrogance. We not only have the propensity to deny God’s sovereignty over our lives, but we also run the risk of living in fear about what tomorrow will bring.\nYou see, I am now wise enough to know that I know nothing about what is coming. But I am also prone to worry about that very fact. Worry is just another form of this same arrogance James warns against. I ask myself, “Why are you worried about what is coming? You have no idea what is coming!”\nWe do not know if the diagnosis will come, the relationship will hold, or the finances will be there. But we do know one thing about tomorrow: we know that Christ will be our certain hope. The hope of the gospel is not like the unstable hope this world offers, where we can only wish for what we want to happen. Our hope in the grace and mercy and steadfast love of God is as certain as the finished work of Christ.\nThe great error in arrogantly thinking we know what tomorrow will bring is that it places our trust in ourselves and our circumstances, rather than in Christ alone. If I am sure about what tomorrow will bring, then not only am I not submitting to God’s sovereignty over all things, but I am also prone to question God’s goodness when tomorrow becomes a place a fear, or doesn’t pan out like I hoped.\nThe gospel mercifully humbles us in the face of God’s will and gives us confidence in the face of the unknown tomorrows before us—all of them.\nWritten by Matthew B.

Satan and his fallen angels thought that they could lead, create, and govern better than God Himself.\nI believe that pride, in its purest and most destructive form, still looks very much like that. It’s the notion that we can somehow lead, discern, and choose better than our Creator. When you say it out loud, it just sounds ridiculous. But at our center there is still this whispering, nudging voice that says, “I can do it better. And for doing it better, I deserve the glory.”\nPerhaps pride can most simply be defined as a longing for glory that doesn’t really belong to us. Instead of desiring a moment of worship and adoration directed towards God, we try to redirect that glory and praise to ourselves.\nConversely, humility was at the center of our reconciliation with God. Jesus humbled Himself to the point of death, even death on a cross, in order to restore the brokenness our collective pride had established. Think about that: the humility of God heals, covers, and restores the prideful destruction of humanity.\nIn the quote above, Augustine was speaking figuratively about men being turned into angels, but the heart of his message is clear. Humility, and not pride, is the posture true Christ followers should seek to adopt.\nIt’s no wonder that James harps on humility so much. He knew it to be the core redemptive posture of his brother and our Lord. James challenges his readers: “Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you” (4:7-8). If we don’t pay careful attention, we miss the fact that this statement is sandwiched between verses exhorting the reader to choose humility as a way of life. This is a spiritual discipline that takes effort, but James knows it to be the way forward.\nYou want to flee from the devil? Live a humble, God-centered life.\nYou want to draw near to God? Mirror the posture that He has perfectly imaged in Jesus, humility.\nPride always seeks personal glory, but leaves you feeling empty and lacking. It promises to make your name powerful, but all it really does is puff you up so that the deflation aches all the more.\nJames calls on us all to walk in the way of Jesus, and to choose humility. Not only because it is the right thing to do, but because it brings a sense of wholeness and unity with God. It may seem counterintuitive, but then again, so is nearly the entire gospel and Jesus’ reverse economy of the Kingdom.\nTo borrow language from Eugene Peterson: live a life of a long obedience in the same direction, a humble life; this is the way of Jesus.\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    When I was a boy, my dad would often pray that the Lord would make us “wise beyond our years.” I’m not sure that I understood the importance of that prayer when I was young. The older I get—and the longer I have been in ministry—the more I appreciate that he prayed it for us.\nThat prayer, however, opens the door for a litany of interconnected questions: What is wisdom? Where does it come from? How do I know that I have wisdom? These are the questions James raises and answers for us in the third chapter of his letter.\nFirst, he tackles the question, “What is wisdom?” Sometimes the best way to define something is to explain what it is not. J. Gresham Machen once explained, “You can’t set forth clearly what a thing is without contrasting it with what it is not… definition proceeds by way of exclusion.”\nJames explains that some who think they are wise actually have hearts full of “bitter envy and self-seeking” (3:14). Bitterness and self-seeking may accompany a form of worldly wisdom, but they are antithetical to true wisdom. By way of contrast, true wisdom is full of meekness. Meekness is willingness to bow to the will of God, even when it means laying aside what I want, for the good of others.\nNext, James contrasts the source of true wisdom and its counterfeit. One is sensual, earthly, and demonic; the other is from above. James calls worldly wisdom “demonic” because it leads to “confusion and every evil thing” (v.16). The Scriptures tell us that the evil one is the author of confusion and the father of lies. When we adopt the wisdom of the world we inevitably begin to live and think like the evil one, rather than like the heavenly Christ.\nFinally, James says we will be able to tell whether the wisdom we possess is from God or from the evil one by what it produces in our lives. Whereas the wisdom of this world brings about bitter envy and self-seeking, the wisdom that is from above manifests itself in “the fruit of righteousness” in the life of the one who possesses it (v.18).\nTrue wisdom is pure in doctrine and life. It is peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, merciful, impartial, and sincere. The question we must ask ourselves is, “Which of these two forms of wisdom am I manifesting in my life?” God’s grace in Christ enables us to become wise beyond our years in the wisdom that is from above.\nWritten by Nicholas Batzig\n\n                ",

Whether we are texting friends, talking with family, or updating social media, we are always communicating and we’re doing it all under the reign of Christ. \nMany of us believe Jesus is Lord over our lives, but do we see His gracious reign over our tongues, our words, our sentences, and paragraphs? Do we post verses in the morning and then speak unkind comments in the afternoon? How often have we sung praises to our great God and Savior and then turned around and gossiped or slandered someone made in God’s image?\nThe tongue is a tiny muscle, hardly noticeable, rigged with two cages—teeth and lips—and yet it still gets out of control. Brothers, Jesus cares about our speech.\nTypically, men love completing tasks. We finish a project at work, mow the grass, or grill the perfect steak, and we enjoy a sense of accomplishment. Well, James looks right at us and says, “Guys, here’s one task you can’t accomplish. You can’t wrangle in your words. You won’t tame your tongue.” \nAnd to make matters worse, James shows us the warhead nature of our sinful words—they leave havoc, pain, and rubble after they’ve been launched. Is James trying to make us feel powerless and hopeless? In a way, yes—so that we’ll find our power and hope in Christ alone.\nHow many times have we tried to be like Jesus without Jesus? Too many. James doesn’t want to us to feel conviction about our speech, hang our heads, and try to do better tomorrow on our own. He tells us straight up, “You can’t tame this beast.”\nBut God can.\nWhether you unleash biting sarcasm, inappropriate humor, rage-filled rants and raves, bragging big-deal-ness, or common complaining, there is good news: Jesus specializes in transforming sinners like us. He gives us new lives with Him. He can tame our tongues. He can retrain our speech. His cross, His empty tomb, and His reign in Heaven transform our hearts and our words.\nWhere the Lord convicts your speech, surrender to Him. Pray “Lord, help me.” He looks toward those who make this humble request. He will draw near.\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n                ",

But what if you purchased a vehicle and looked under the hood to find that there was no engine? I’m no car expert, but I know the engine is essential for the car to run. It is not an “extra.” This is a picture of the Christian life: Faith is the engine that powers our works. And faith without works is dead faith.\nAs disciples of Jesus Christ, our proclamation of faith is validated in our demonstration of good works. When Jesus is acknowledged as the good King who sits on the throne over all of our desires, it changes the way we live out our faith. We live as God’s children—children who believe in the one true King. And we live as His servants who want to carry out His will.\nOur works do not save us. Jesus’ work alone produces the saving faith that springs forth from one’s heart. Only by faith in Jesus’ kingship and His triumph over the power of death can we be brought to a newness of life—new creations, found in Him complete. God the Father gives this gift of faith by grace. Grace is a currency that is unattainable by any human work. \nGrace is not transactional. It is charity—a completely free gift from God which produces faith in faithless men and causes us to cling to Jesus.\nThe very Word of God wrapped in flesh cried out on the rugged cross, “It is finished!” Three days later He rose and defeated death. No man is capable of keeping perfect faith on his own. But as they used to say in the old church choir, “He is able.” God is able to keep the engine of faith running. Even in our hypocritical moments of disconnect between our words and our deeds, He keeps us and uses us.\nWe are men of imperfect faith, but we are met with perfect grace. By remembering and trusting in God’s faithful work, our faith will never die. Our faith is living and active because it is in a living, active God who eternally loves us and uses us for His glory.\nWritten by Jevon Washington\n\n                ",

Those are the sins that clearly break God’s law. We don’t do those things. (I mean, unless you count bitterness, coveting, lust, or pornography. Moving on quickly, though.)\nYet we’re all law-breakers in one overarching way: we lack love. Wait, what? Yes, a lack of love and a lack of mercy not only break God’s law, but this is where all law breaking comes from.\nJames brings this to our attention by describing favoritism in the church. A wealthy person receives honor while a poor person is ignored and pushed to the fringes. The richly attired person is moved front and center while the shabby person is asked to sit in the back. In our context today, this kind of attitude and behavior dons other garments—racial favoritism, gender favoritism, generational favoritism, and cultural favoritism. We are all inclined to favor one kind of person over another. And in so doing, we fail to love as Christ loved.\nWe think of “love your neighbor as yourself” as the Golden Rule. That’s a cute, shiny phrase, but it undersells what Jesus calls one of the two greatest commandments. This must mean love is deeper and broader than we normally think of it—more active and big and robust and committed, not simply romantic or feely. Love must be an attitude and a perspective, even a lifestyle. It must be a shaping, defining force.\nWhen we lack love, we judge, whether or not we are in any position to do so. We judge others more harshly than we would like to be judged and for the very things we fail at daily. We forget we will be held to the very standard by which we judge others. We are blinded by the log in our own eye while we make much of the sawdust in someone else’s.\nWe are all law-breakers because we lack love. For this reason, we deserve judgment and we need mercy. We need it foremost from Jesus, and we have it. \nChrist’s mercy has already triumphed over judgment. But has it done so in our lives? Do we share that mercy forward and do we receive it from others? Are we shaped by it or by the desire to judge others in order to position ourselves as something we are not?\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I have a quick temper. Just ask my family. In an attempt to be repentant and Christlike, I typically have to take a few moments to gather myself when my wife frustrates me or my kids disobey. Sometimes I’m silent. Sometimes I have to leave the room and come back. If I’m not careful, I can be like a tea kettle with steam billowing out of my ears, my only way to cool off being an ice-water bath from the Holy Spirit.\nI know I should be “quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger” (James 1:19), but I don’t always do it. That’s because, ultimately, my mind doesn’t always connect to my heart. As James tells us in this passage, we can’t merely hear God’s Word—we have to act on it.\nBelief is an interesting thing. Everyone believes in something, right? Not just normal beliefs, like “the grass is green” or “the sky is blue.” Everyone believes in deeper truths, like goodness and beauty and love and purpose. I believe it’s right to control my temper, yet often I act out anyway.\nAs Christians, our beliefs go even further. We confess and believe certain things about God and about how the universe does (or doesn’t) work. In other words, we don’t believe in a generic, watered-down God. The commands of Scripture and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit are unique signposts for Christian living. They are how we move from a general morality to Christlikeness. They are how we are kept “unstained from the world” (James 1:27).\nWe do what we believe. According to Paul in Romans 10:9, what we confess with our mouths and believe in our hearts is a matter of salvation, of eternity. James says elsewhere that even the demons believe (2:19)! And yet the demons are anything but godly. They are the embodiment of evil.\nThis command—“be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger”—is a perfect example of the difference between a hearer and a doer of the Word. We can believe one thing with our minds, but “the mouth speaks from the overflow of the heart” (Matthew 12:34). Our ability to heed these words in James 1:19 reveals much about the state of our hearts.\nTrust me, I should know.\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    How can we rejoice in suffering? It really seems like an outlandish question, doesn’t it? Suffering and rejoicing feel like opposites, and we prefer the rejoicing by a landslide. So how can these have any compatibility?\nThey cannot be compatible unless we can live in the depth of them both. We have to resist the superficial “just rejoice and be happy.” We cannot ignore our suffering.\nPart of our problem is that we idolize comfort and efficiency. We live under the idea that if something is comfortable, then it is good; and if it is also efficient and productive, even better. \nEnter: our suffering. \nChristians are really good at asking about what we are learning in suffering, as if every horrible event that brings us to our breaking point could be summed up in some three-point action plan for becoming better people. I once heard someone say that we want suffering to be like a pregnancy—pain and discomfort for a set time, then a wonderful life lesson emerges in the end.\nBut suffering is real and painful. And we have no promise that in the end, if there even is an end, we will gain some lesson to pass forward. In suffering we encounter the reality that this is not how it is supposed to be, and that God is close to the brokenhearted. To grasp both of these is to rejoice.\nTwo years ago when I was thrown into the role of widower and single dad to four kids, I experienced a level of suffering that seemed unimaginable. By God’s grace and in my own frailty, I sat in my grief. I tried to avoid any quick fix, like a new addiction or moving on. I just sat and cried and suffered.\nDuring that time, I felt completely inefficient and unproductive. Eventually, my joy began to return in the midst of this brokenness. James 1:3 says the testing of our faith produces steadfastness. I saw this steadfastness in the way God gave me the strength to get out of bed each morning; such a simple thing to rejoice in.\nIt is interesting that James moves from suffering and the benefits of suffering to this instruction: “If any of you lacks wisdom, let Him ask of God, who gives generously.” Perhaps our suffering is where we grasp the wisdom and goodness of God, and in this wisdom, we rejoice in His grace.\nSuffering has the ability to shatter any superficial idol of comfort, and we would be wise to let it. Don’t run from your suffering, but rejoice that God will never leave you.\nWritten by Jason Tippetts\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    It was the end of October. It was New Jersey. And we were seated outside in view of the shoreline. My wife, Laurin, and I had traveled many miles north from our oh-so-warm home in Georgia for her cousin’s wedding. We had not realized the ceremony was going to be held in the open air, and we had not dressed for the weather. It was windy, and it was freezing—almost literally. The temperature was hovering somewhere in the upper 30s. More than once during the ceremony, my bride nudged me in the ribs because my teeth were chattering audibly.\nThe scene itself was beautiful: the bride and groom holding hands under the arbor, bathed in autumn light, with the rhythm of the ocean waves lapping steadily behind their wedding vows. But I was too busy counting the seconds until we would be dismissed into the gloriously well-heated hotel ballroom for the reception. When that wonderful moment came, Laurin and I were among the first to find our way inside. As the rest of the wedding guests entered the ballroom, I watched them as they quickly shed their coats. The garments that had brought them comfort outdoors no longer had the same effect inside.\nThere is coming a day when those who have been comfortable in this broken world will no longer be so. That is why Peter, at the close of his second letter, tells us, “Therefore, dear friends, while you wait for these things, make every effort to be found without spot or blemish in his sight, at peace” (2 Peter 3:14). Peter wants us to get ready now for the world that is coming, a kingdom where righteousness reigns. It’s time to shed the sins we hide behind, those fears that threaten to consume us, and our misguided attempts to find security apart from Jesus.\nIt’s striking to me that our reading from 2 Peter today comprises the last recorded words of the apostle Peter in Scripture. Think about his journey from Galilean fisherman to close friend of Jesus to denying disciple to Spirit-filled apostle. Tradition tells us that not too long after this final letter was penned, Peter was crucified in Rome for his faith in Jesus Christ. He seems to have known his death was imminent, for earlier in the letter he wrote, “I know that I will soon lay aside my tent, as our Lord Jesus Christ has indeed made clear to me” (1:14), likely an allusion to John 21:18–19. Peter was focused on the world to come, and his final words are a plea for us to do the same. We do that when we “grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 3:18), because only that which reflects the goodness, truth, and beauty of Jesus will last.\nPeter, the disciple who once rebuked Jesus for talking about His death (Matthew 16:22), can now say with his own martyrdom in full view, “To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity” (3:18). The kingdom is coming. Now is our time to prepare, so that through our lives, Jesus will have the glory that is rightfully His. As the day draws near, may we look toward the future with the same single-minded focus as Peter.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In the past few decades, there has been no shortage of speculation about Christ’s return in popular culture. From novels and movies that present elaborate scenarios to Y2K scares and sincere (but misguided) predictions about specific dates, it’s been difficult to escape teaching about the end of the world and Jesus’s second coming. Believers can read the same Scriptures but come to different conclusions about the specifics. That’s okay. Our understanding of the end of days is not a salvation issue. But here in 2 Peter, we find an interesting spin on the end-times debate.\nWhile prediction books and code-cracking movies abound in our day, Peter says that we shouldn’t be in the prediction business. Why? Because Jesus will come “like a thief in the night” (1 Thessalonians 5:2), in a time or manner we won’t expect. So until then, he says, we should be patient, knowing that God is delaying the end so that more will be saved.\nBut Jesus didn’t come live a perfect life and conquer the grave so we could sit on our hands. He made us new creations here and now, to be ministers of reconciliation here and now, and to be His mouthpiece here and now (2 Corinthians 5:17–21). He sends us out to mirror what the end of Revelation promises—that God is making all things new. Our lives should shout eternity to the world around us.\nThe disciples in Acts 2 weren’t merely preaching and living out good morals; rather, they were painting a picture with their lives of the new world God is creating. They were pointing to something bigger. The disciples shared all their belongings because, in eternity, everything broken will become unbroken. There will be no more evil or selfishness or famine. People will live together in one accord under the reign of a perfect King. And so now, “we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness dwells” (2 Peter 3:13).\nThis is still our call today. We are still ministers of reconciliation. God still uses His people to show the world what redemption looks like. We give because, one day, no one will be in need. We tell the truth because, one day, there will be no more lies. We gather together to worship God and to press one another toward Him because, one day, worship will be the air we breathe. We share the good news because, one day, there will be no more bad news.\nWritten by Brandon Smith\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I’ll never forget watching a television preacher spend an entire sermon defending gluttony and greed. His sermon was simple: gluttony and greed were sins that were included in the Old Testament Law. They were a way to keep people in check. But now, because of Christ’s life and death, Christians were perfectly free to store up their bellies and bank accounts without concern. After all, “nothing is impossible with God!”\nIn our passage today, we see a stark warning against false teachers. They come in all theological shapes and sizes, from denying Jesus’s resurrection to claiming that God is essentially an ATM with endless cash for those who pray long and hard enough. This passage seems to indicate another kind of false teaching—some version of denying Jesus’s second coming (see 2 Peter 3) and indulging in sinful behavior.\nIn the Gospels, Jesus calls the Pharisees hypocrites and sons of the devil. It wasn’t because they taught the law or expected people to follow certain rules; rather, He scolded them for being a type of false teachers who skewed God’s law in a way that made it antithetical to the gospel. In fact, Jesus compliments some Pharisees for asking the right questions and trying to better understand the law—a law Jesus came to fulfill, not abolish. Here, Peter is chastising counter-Pharisees who seem to think there are no rules that apply to them anymore.\nBut there is hope for those who follow Jesus. “The Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials” (2 Peter 2:9). Those who keep His Word, who hear His voice (John 10:27) will be rescued from suffering and judgment. Why? Because believing in Christ requires certain beliefs and actions. Those who teach against the gospel show that their beliefs and actions are in opposition to Christ. But those who believe in Him also believe and act rightly.\nBoth extremes—rigid rule-following and unhinged rule-breaking—are simply opposed to the gospel. Praise God that through the gospel we’ve been freed from our sin and the curses that come with it. But let us also praise God that He’s shown us a way of living that honors Him and reflects His image to the world around us.\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

There are no microphones, so the volume comes from the power of the instruments and voices, as well as the acoustics in the concert hall. And that volume, without any help from electricity, is powerful.\nA few days ago, my wife and I went to see Handel’s Messiah performed by our city’s symphony orchestra and a rather large choir. The experience was magical. During the two hours we sat listening to the concert, I kept thinking how remarkable it was to hear the gospel declared so clearly in that packed concert hall. It was wonderful to hear Scripture sung clearly and loudly in English. Hearing all those prophecies from Isaiah set to some of the most beautiful music ever made was worth the price of admission.\nAs I sit here and write this, our Christmas tree is sparkling. Presents are strewn around the tree. There are lights and greenery on the mantle. Nutcrackers stand like sentinels on a bookcase. We are just a few days away from the celebration of a tiny baby being born in a tiny town, where “the hopes and fears of all years are met.” Where did all that hope come from? We find the answer in those same verses Handel used in his magnum opus.\nIn 2 Peter 1:16–21, Peter wants his readers to know they can trust the prophecies about the Messiah in the Old Testament are fulfilled in Jesus. He wants them to know they can count on the prophetic word. Christ’s coming is not some cleverly devised myth. The stories are true. The prophecies are fulfilled. Yes, there have been false prophets, just like there are false teachers now. But that does not change the fact that Jesus has come and is the promised Messiah.\nThis is no fiction. Old Testament Scriptures are reliable and point to “the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ” (v.16). We need to be reminded of this too. Because these were given by the Holy Spirit and we would “do well to pay attention [to them] as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in [our] hearts” (v.19).\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

And for the first time I saw a house I’d never noticed before. No, it was never hidden by trees; it’s always been right there, in plain view. I just never got a good look at it. It’s a very attractive house that I’ve missed time and time again. My first thought was how there are so many beautiful things I must miss every single day.\nI miss them in the Scriptures too.\nWhen considering what Peter means when he says, “May grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord” (2 Peter 1:2), I looked at other places where the words “grace” and “peace” are coupled together, and I was surprised at the result. Almost every letter in the New Testament starts with the author expressing a desire for the reader to have grace and peace.\nEven though I have taught on nearly all of these books at one time or another, I never noticed how pervasive this greeting is. What do these writers want for the readers of their letters? What does it mean to have “grace and peace multiplied”?\nPeter’s wish does have a qualification. He wants grace and peace to be born of their “knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.” In other words, Peter want grace and peace to be “multiplied” to the reader because of what they themselves know about God and their Lord, Jesus.\nThere are times when life gets hard. Money gets tight. Parenting well seems impossible. Friendships and air conditioners fail. The storms come, and we imagine God is being harsh and working against us. We start wondering what we did to deserve difficult, heartbreaking circumstances. We run through our memory’s rolodex trying to figure out what sin we committed that warrants such treatment from God.\nAll that sounds foolish unless you are in the middle of the suffering—you know, like Peter’s original readers. And the same is true of us. While in the midst of suffering, it’s hard to imagine the grace and peace of God are ours. But that is when we most need to have grace and peace multiplied to us. That is when we need to remember the gospel. When we are tempted to think God is against us, we need to remember Peter’s expressed desire in the opening of his second letter. Because of the work of Jesus on the cross, we have peace—not just feelings of peace, but real peace—with God. We are never at odds. His disposition toward us is always one of grace and peace.\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

But this is a mistake, even though the original word in the Greek does in fact mean “sober.” Allow me to explain. Peter’s call for sobriety is bookended between two discussions of suffering. The first is encouragement, found at the end of chapter 4, and the other is this: “Resist [the devil], firm in the faith, knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced by your fellow believers throughout the world” (1 Peter 5:9).\nAnd that is why I think Peter’s call for sobriety is all about belief and not behavior. Peter is concerned about the faith of His readers surviving in the midst of suffering. “Keep awake! Show some self-control! Be alert! In the midst of you suffering, the devil is out to wreck your faith!”—I think that is what Peter is trying to say in this passage.\nHe knows what we all know. The most important things are often the things we cannot see. We can see our sufferings. If the suffering is intense enough—and we know it certainly was for Peter’s original readers—our faith can waver. We can begin to lose control of our imagination, which is really the lack of sobriety Peter is worried about.\nWe imagine what it would be like to let go of our faith. We picture in our minds an easier life. We picture freedom and imagine the suffering will go away. We daydream about all the ways we might get control of our own life which, at any given moment, appears to be coming apart at the seams.\nPeter wants them (and us) to know the devil is at work in this wavering. This is why he uses the image of a lion to capture our imagination, so we can “see” by faith the danger we are actually in. He wants us to picture the suffering of other believers. And he wants us to remember we are not alone. He encourages us to think about the restoration that is coming, to remember that Jesus has dominion. He is the King after all.\nOur imaginations can run wild. Peter wants us to be alert to the fact that we do have an adversary working against us, but all the while we have a King who never stops working for us.\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Most men reading this are not elders (or pastors or deacons or priests or any other sort of official church leader), so the question confronting us about this text is this: So what? Why should we pay special attention to a passage about elders. The obvious answer is that it is in God’s Word, so it must matter. But there is a more pointed, personal reason to care about Peter’s words to elders.\nElders, those men who lead churches, lead your church. They are your leaders, your example. They are your friends. You are part of a single body of believers, peers as followers of Christ. And do not miss what Paul says in 1 Timothy 3: “If anyone aspires to be an overseer, he desires a noble work” (v.1). You may feel pulled toward church leadership right now, or you may in the future, and that is a good thing! So these are words for you as brothers of the elders, followers of the elders, and people who aspire to be elders.\nIn both 1 Peter 5 and 1 Timothy 3, the apostles lay out standards by which church leaders should live. These are “qualifications” in one sense, but foundationally they are standards for Christian character, standards to which every follower of Jesus should hold himself. We should all serve willingly, avoid greed, be above reproach, and be faithful husbands. Every Christian man should be hospitable, respectable, avoid excessive drinking, not be bullies, have an upstanding reputation in the community, avoid hypocrisy, and manage our households. These are measures of Christ-likeness, and in this way these are words for every man.\nBut church leaders are called to something unique. They must be able to teach. They must lead others and be an example. They shepherd God’s flock as they follow the Chief Shepherd. Peter makes clear that within the Church, leaders must be followers, submitting themselves to Christ intentionally and faithfully.\nOne characteristic is the banner over all the others and the foundation underneath them: humility. In 1 Peter 5:5 Peter commands, “All of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another.” For those who are not elders this instruction enables us to learn and follow well. For leaders, it enables them to avoid a false sense of self-importance and the false mindset that God’s flock is their flock. To clothe ourselves in humility is constant and holistic, a perpetual awareness of who we are before God.\nHumility ties every other qualification and characteristic of a godly man together. It enables them and empowers them—how else could we be hospitable, open to correction, generous, and caring? Our bent is toward pride and that undermines everything Peter and Paul command in these passages. But humility unifies. Humility creates leaders we want to follow, and followers who are a joy to lead. And humility honors God by exemplifying Christ most clearly, the truest calling of every believer.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Our most common question when suffering comes is “Why?” Why is this happening, and, more specifically, why is it happening to me? We are floored by unexpected troubles. While it’s natural and okay to wonder, this passage from 1 Peter frames the response to suffering quite differently. “Do not be surprised… as if something unusual were happening to you.” Peter is telling us to expect suffering and hardship. He also gives an answer to the question, “Why?”\nScripture offers a multi-layered and miles-deep answer to why people suffer, all of which is anchored in the sovereignty of God and the result of sin in the world. Some suffering is a result of the natural world’s brokenness and being cursed (Genesis 3). Some is the result of our sins and stupidity. Some is the result of injustice and others’ sin. But this passage looks particularly at suffering that is a result of living for Jesus, the cost of faithfulness to Him. The cause of this suffering is doing right, following our Savior, and being in Christ. It is suffering for being where, what, and who we truly ought to be.\nThat may be the cause of the suffering, but it is not the purpose of it. First Peter chapter 4 points us to the purpose: to “share in the sufferings of Christ so that you may rejoice with great joy when his glory is revealed” (v.13). It goes on to say, “If you are ridiculed for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the spirit of glory and of God rests on you” (v.14). Rejoice. Be blessed. The purpose of this suffering is to draw us closer to Jesus in such a way that we profoundly recognize and know His joy and His Spirit.\nIn the midst of suffering we often struggle to feel this truth. We know it, we remember it, but we don’t sense it. What we sense is the injustice and pain of suffering, both of which are profoundly real. Scripture speaks to this too. It speaks to the injustice by promising a Judge, a defender whose “delight will be in the fear of the LORD,” who will not judge based on appearances or earthly standards, but will “judge the poor righteously and execute justice for the oppressed” (Isaiah 11:3–4).\nScripture speaks to the pain by promising wholeness. The beatitudes (Matthew 5:3–11) are a liturgy for the hurting and those who are the lowest. What do they promise? Comfort, inheritance, fullness, mercy, the presence, kinship, and kingdom of God. This is why we can “entrust [ourselves] to a faithful Creator while doing what is good” (1 Peter 4:19). He has promised that our suffering has a purpose, that justice is coming, and that comfort will abound in His kingdom and for His family.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    One of the most uncomfortable and countercultural aspects of Christianity is its dependence on death. In our Western culture we abhor even the mention of death. We fend it off, euphemize it, and ignore it. When it comes to death, we cover our eyes like children; if we refuse to see it, then it must not exist. But the very hope of our faith depends on death—the death of Jesus and our death to sin.\nFrom the first verse in today’s reading, we see it: Christ suffered in the flesh (1 Peter 4:1), we were baptized into His death and were buried with Him in baptism (Romans 6:3–4). This is no morbid wallowing in mortality, nor is it merely a metaphor. This is the path to following Jesus. Christ’s death truly killed the power of sin and death, and in Him sin is killed in us too. We live “no longer for human desires, but for God’s will” (1 Peter 4:2). Our old self was crucified so that sin would be rendered powerless. We died with Christ, so we could live with Him (Romans 6:6,8).\nWhat does this look like? It often means our lives make no sense to the world around us. Our neighbors, friends, and coworkers may even resent us for no longer living like they do, as we leave behind our sinful lifestyles (1 Peter 4:4). In Christ we can’t follow the same evil desires we did before. We are tempted, and we will sin, but our lives are no longer ruled by sin. Instead our lives are to be marked by urgency and alertness, because God will judge both believers and unbelievers (vv.5–7). We are to exemplify Jesus by being hospitable, serving, using our gifts to care for others, and speaking God’s Word to one another.\n“Above all,” Peter says, “maintain constant love for one another, since love covers a multitude of sins” (v.8). He is echoing an ancient proverb God gave Solomon (Proverbs 10:12) and tying it to faithful discipleship. Love should be constant, not wavering or wilting, depending on feelings or circumstances. It is to be “for one another,” meaning believers in Jesus are to love other believers in Jesus. This means no division, no gossip, no backbiting, for love allows no room for those.\nLove covers a multitude of sins, and it’s a good thing, too, because we will commit a multitude of sins. How does love cover them? Covering doesn’t mean making, fostering, or protecting them in secrecy. No, love smothers sins and protects sinners. It covers sinners like clothes cover nakedness, like armor covers and protects a body. It cover sins like a debt already paid, gone and done with, forgotten and settled. We know this because this is how Jesus loved. He killed sin and saved sinners, so that God would be glorified through Christ. So we seek to do the same in our obedience, faithfulness, and love for one another.\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    A number of years ago, a meme with a picture of first Century Christians, standing in a Roman stadium and surrounded by lions, was floating around various social media sites. The caption underneath the picture said, “God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.” It was quite an impactful illustration of what is missing in so much that passes for Christian teaching today. Many are led to believe that if they come to Christ, their life will get easier and easier. In fact, the opposite is the case. When we come to Christ, we do so with the expectation that we will suffer and endure hardship on His account. What enables us to endure suffering for the name of Christ is that He suffered in the flesh for us.\nThe apostles were themselves men well acquainted with suffering, and members of the early church witnessed how much the apostles endured for the sake of the gospel. Nevertheless, Peter believed it was necessary to remind first century believers about the blessing of suffering for the sake of Christ. He wrote, “It is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil” (1 Peter 3:17).\nNothing can hurt us if we endure suffering for the sake of Christ. Jesus taught this when He said, “Don’t fear those who kill the body, and after that can do nothing more” (Luke 12:4). The suffering we are called to endure in this life serves the glory that shall be revealed in us. The first Christian martyr, Stephen, knew this when he looked up into heaven as he was being stoned and prayed with the face like an angel, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!” (Acts 7:59). Polycarp, a disciple of the apostle John, learned what it meant to suffer for doing good. While burning at the stake for his testimony, he famously said, “Eighty-six years I’ve served him, and he has never done me injury.”\nWhen we arm ourselves with the same mind with which Christ was armed, we will be able to endure hardship for the glory of God. Since Jesus suffered for us (1 Peter 3:18), to forgive us and to bring us to glory, we can suffer for Him. The suffering we endure for doing what is good is a mark of God’s blessing, rather than a mark of failure and loss. In the end, it will be seen as gain. May God give us the grace to remember the One who suffered for us to bring us to God, so that we might suffer for Him to bring Him glory.\nWritten by Nicholas Batzig\n\n                ",

In almost all of the discussion about modesty I overheard in the ’80s and ’90s, it was inevitably framed around young Christian women who were supposedly not wearing enough clothing to church or school. The Bible actually does have quite a bit to say about modesty, but, contrary to what one might expect, it is not with regard to how much clothing a young woman is (or isn’t) wearing. Rather, it’s focused on how women of any age were adorning themselves in order to gain attention.\nGod is more concerned with inner beauty than He is with external beauty. Peter sums this up so well when he tells wives, “Don’t let your beauty consist of outward things… but rather what is inside the heart” (1 Peter 3:3–4). In a day when we are consumed with body enhancement surgeries, cosmetic and health products, and fitness regimens, it would do us a world of good to reconsider what is most important to God. The fact of the matter is, God is far more concerned with the hearts of His people.\nThis truth should animate godly wives to give the better part of their time and energy to cultivating the beauty of “a gentle and quiet spirit” within (v.4). This should also motivate Christian men to value and encourage what is most beautiful in this precious gift of a godly wife. A godly husband delights in what is most valuable—the image of Christ renewed in his bride. As the book of Proverbs tell us, “Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised” (Proverbs 31:30). There is something more worthwhile, more glorious, and more desirable than the external beauty the fallen world prizes above all else.\nCultivating and valuing our spouse’s inner beauty is the key to a lasting and God-honoring marriage. When wives seek to adorn themselves with a spirit that is “precious to God,” and when husbands seek to lovingly dwell with them in understanding, beauty abounds. May God give us grace to cultivate and value the reflected beauty of Christ in our marriages.\nWritten by Nicholas Batzig\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    One of my all time favorite hymns is the old African-American spiritual, “Were You There When They Crucified My Lord?” Every time I sing it, I want to cry out loud, “You bet I was there! I was nailed to the tree with Him as He hung under the wrath of God for me.” That is, of course, the great truth of our union with Christ. What the Savior did, He did for His people. Whatever He endured, He endured in our place and for our good. This is the heart of the gospel itself. When Jesus died, our old sin nature was crucified with Him. When He was buried, our old sin nature was put away from the presence of God in the tomb. And, when Jesus stepped out of the tomb, we stepped out with Him unto newness of life.\nFrom the great exchange to the great renewal, everything about the Christian life is summed up in our union with Christ in His death and resurrection. The apostle Peter captured this truth so marvelously when he wrote, “He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree; so that, having died to sins, we might live for righteousness” (1 Peter 2:24). Sin is what keeps us from living a life that is pleasing to God. Jesus came to deal with our sin on the cross. He died to the power of it. He died for the guilt of it. He took the shame of it upon Himself. When Jesus died, He was treated as the worst sinner who had ever walked the face of the earth—even though He knew no sin in His personal experience. God the Father reckoned Christ a sinner in our place, so that He might do what we could never do for ourselves. That is the great exchange of the gospel.\nAs glorious a truth as that is in itself, there is another beautiful dimension to the gospel. Peter tells us that He took our sin in His own body on the tree so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. When Jesus rose from the dead, He raised us up with Him so that we might bear fruit to God. We have been brought into a new world of grace, one in which we live and move as part of God’s new creation in Christ. We were redeemed to live out lives of holiness unto God. Our union with Jesus Christ crucified and raised is, in every way, the secret of our sanctification. May God give us grace to remember this precious truth as we seek to live out our new lives in union with Him!\nWritten by Nicholas Batzig\n\n                ",

However, we can’t run away from the fact that we form tribes over seemingly anything and everything—from the love of a certain football team to an affinity for gourmet coffee. But the best tribes are those where the connection runs deep, when being together feels like a family gathering.\nIn the Bible, God formed tribes—quite literally. From Jacob’s sons, He formed twelve tribes that would become the nation of Israel, His chosen people from all the peoples of the earth. That, of course, did not mean God was altogether abandoning the rest of humanity. The purpose of setting Israel apart had always been to shine a light to the Gentiles. This happened at times, but for most of the Old Testament, the people of Israel saw their chosen status as a reason to boast rather than a reason to shine.\nAnd then came Jesus, the light of the world. Through His life, death, and resurrection, He made a way for people from every nation to be saved. The dividing wall between Jew and Gentile was torn down.\nPeter, one of Jesus’s closest friends, had an ongoing struggle with this. He had to receive a supernatural vision and hear a voice from heaven before he would enter the house of the Gentile Cornelius and share the gospel (Acts 10:9–48). Later, he refused to sit with Gentile Christians for fear of what his Jewish friends might think (Galatians 2:11–14). But something changed in Peter. In the letter we now know as 1 Peter, he writes to Gentile Christians, “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his possession” (1 Peter 2:9). These descriptors were all once used of Israel. But now, because of Christ, Gentiles have been invited into the tribe.\nOur hope is not found in where we happened to be born or in whatever group the world has placed us. The only tribe that matters is the tribe of Jesus. In Him, we belong. In Him, we are adopted as God’s children. In Him, we have an inheritance beyond measure.\nIn the same letter, Peter also says, “Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people” (v.10). This language is borrowed from the book of Hosea. There, God used the prophet Hosea’s marriage to an adulterous woman to illustrate Israel’s unfaithfulness. Israel had broken the covenant they made with God at Sinai, and they did not deserve to be called His people. But the truth is, none of us deserve it. Not one of us is faithful. Not one of us is good enough. After all his ups and downs, Peter finally got the message: Jesus did on our behalf what we could never do on our own, so that we could be included in His tribe.

The back of our couch had disconnected from the arms and was being held together solely by the grace of God. I set about fixing it, trying to force the connecting pieces together again and, in my frustration, a few (mild) expletives burst forth from my mouth. My daughter was right to call me out. We generally avoid swearing in our home, as we strive to be considerate with our words, and I was acting out of step with our family’s values. But I was also out of step with a larger calling: one to holy living.\n“As the one who called you is holy,” Peter wrote, “you also are to be holy in all your conduct” (1 Peter 1:15). Perhaps this call fills you with a sense of panic, guilt, or even shame. After all, how many of us can look at these words and think, Nailed it!—I mean, really? And when we’re confronted by the holes in our holiness, what do we usually do? We commit to working harder. We pull ourselves up by our spiritual bootstraps and take our first step. But because we forget to tie them up, we trip and stumble again—and again, and again, and again—until we’re ready to throw our hands up in the air and just give up.\nBut when Peter calls his readers to holiness, when he reminds them that God’s people are to be holy in all our conduct, he doesn’t write expecting them to “just be more holy,” as we so often expect of ourselves. He knows what it’s like to fall short (after all, he did deny Jesus three times). So rather than appealing to the force of will, Peter roots the call to holy living in the gospel.\nThrough Christ, you were “redeemed from your empty way of life inherited from your fathers” (v.18). You were foreknown, chosen before the foundations of the world; you were a beloved child from before the beginning (Ephesians 1:4–5). You were purchased with the precious blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:19), the Lamb of God who silently bore our sins and was struck down because of our rebellion (Isaiah 53:7–8), all according to the riches of His grace, “richly poured out on us with all wisdom and understanding” (Ephesians 1:7–8).\nThat’s what makes the pursuit of holiness, this call to holy living, possible. That’s what makes it a delight, as much as a duty. Yes, without question, we have an obligation to pursue holiness. But the gospel reminds us that in Christ, we have been declared holy—He has done it all! And so, the call to holy living is not a call to make ourselves holy, but to live in light of who we already are: beloved sons and daughters of the Father, adopted into His family through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. So don’t set your hope for holiness in your own strength. Doing so will leave you disappointed every time. Instead, “set your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ” (1 Peter 1:13). The gospel is the fuel for our pursuit of holy living; it will never disappoint.\nWritten by Aaron Armstrong\n\n                ",

It was through the screen on my phone as I filmed his birth by C-section. I discovered afterwards that making my short movie was against hospital regulations, but I would hit record again in a heartbeat if I had it to do over.\nThough his mother and I had wondered what our child would look like, when I saw Jonah, red in the face from the primal scream of birth and shivering from the air-conditioning in the operating room, it was as if I’d always known him. Like I said, it’s hard to explain.\nNow I can’t quite remember what my life was like before I had kids. They belong with me and are a part of me. Life could never be the same without them. So, that moment when I first saw Jonah in the hospital, it was as if I’d recognized him from some previous meeting, like I’d always known him. Someday, those of us who know Jesus will finally meet Him face to face. I imagine it will be a similar sensation. We will recognize Him immediately and be unable to remember exactly what life was like before being forever united with our Savior in this way.\nThe apostle Peter encourages us to endure “various trials so that the proven character of your faith… may result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ” (1 Peter 1:6–7). Everything is leading up to that moment, when Christ returns and we finally see Him face to face. To borrow a phrase from the hymn writer Horatio Spafford, it is the day “when faith shall be sight.” It will change everything.\nPeter knew something of this. He had been the disciple to first identify Jesus as “the Messiah, the Son of the living God” (Matthew 16:16), but he ran away and hid when his sight didn’t match his faith—when he saw Jesus being arrested and tried as a blasphemer, when he saw Jesus remain silent amidst taunts and accusations. Peter had been there when Jesus raised people from the dead. He had watched Him feed five thousand with a boy’s lunch. He had seen the Lord walk on the water, and even joined Him on the lake momentarily. But Peter doubted and denied Jesus when what he believed and what he saw no longer lined up.\nWho better than Peter to encourage us to live with Jesus’s return in mind? He knows there will be days when faith and sight don’t align. There will be times when our troubles make it appear to our senses that the world and God’s enemies are right after all, that the hope of the Christian is a fool’s hope. But there is a day coming when all of that nonsense will be put to rest, once and for all. The risen and returning King Jesus will be revealed, and those who have placed their trust in Him will be vindicated. Even now, even in those moments when pressure is mounting on every side, we can have joy because, as Peter put it, “you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls” (1 Peter 1:9), the fullness of which will come when the Son of God returns to earth.

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    There’s a phrase we use in our house often. My kids can recite it by heart. It first came about when my son asked me if Indiana Jones got crushed by the giant boulder. He had never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, a problem I remedied as quickly as possible. But he knew Indy had to run from a boulder, and he wanted to know how that ended. I refused to tell him, saying he needed to discover that on his own. He said, “Why won’t you just tell me?” My answer, and the phrase we’ve all since memorized, was this: “Let the storyteller tell the story in the way they want to tell it.”\nIn other words, let’s not spoil the ending. Let’s get there honestly. Let’s let others do the same. If you jump to the ending, you may discover what happens, but you will have missed so much of the context for why it matters.\nHere we are, in the last chapter, not only of Revelation, but of the entire Bible. Revelation 22 tells us that Jesus is coming again, and soon (vv.7,20). With that promise comes a call for believers to “keep the words of the prophecy of this book” (v.8). Those two details carry so much importance in light of the context of the book of Revelation, and the whole of Scripture. How so?\nJesus is coming again. When we go all the way back to the beginning of the Bible, we find God at work creating everything we know and calling it good. We see Him make mankind in His image, and we see humanity rebel against Him. Then we hear the clink of the flaming swords of Eden as our first parents are cast out of the garden. What follows is an ongoing struggle between God and His people. Will we ever be reconciled? Will that reconciliation be the kind that lasts? Revelation 22 reveals the answer: Yes.\nUntil that day, we are to “keep the words of this book” (v.9). What will God’s reconciling work in Christ look like? Will it be empty tolerance, or intimate affection? The call to obey Scripture reassures us that God’s eternal plan for His people is one of relational intimacy. We are not merely tolerated by God. We are loved. We are kept. We will live in an ongoing eternal relationship with Him, and in this life, we practice the life to come by seeking to live according to the Word of our God, who does not change.\nThis is how the Storyteller has told the story. We are called to persevere in obedience and live in light of the reality that Jesus is coming back, knowing that when He does, it will be as a Bridegroom coming for His Bride. And all will be well. Forever.\n“Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!” (Revelation 22:20).\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

Let’s play.\nAnswer: “Then the one seated on the throne said, ‘Look, I am making everything new’” (Revelation 21:5).\nQuestion: What has the entire story of Scripture been building up to since the garden of Eden and the fall of man?\nThis might just be my favorite verse in the entire Bible, when John writes about the loud voice he hears from the throne of heaven proclaiming the renewal of all things. When the One seated on the throne—the risen Jesus—says that He is making all things new, He is addressing the undoing of all that was lost when our first parents turned away from God in Eden. He is proclaiming the reach of His redemptive work. He is celebrating the power He alone wields. And He is giving those who believe in Him the greatest assurance we could ever hope to hear—that every struggle, weakness, grief, and cause for suffering will be done away with, once and forever.\nI read an article the other day where a seminary president said it wasn’t necessary to believe in a literal bodily resurrection, and that the purpose of Easter was to inspire us all to be better people to one another. What an empty take on the finished work of Christ. And what a tragic omission of the testimony of Scripture. John’s vision in Revelation is far from metaphorical. Sure, some of the imagery carries metaphorical meaning, but the end of the story is anything but metaphor. Everything will be made new. The old order of things will pass away. Forever. For real.\nOne of the marks of this new creation will be the presence of Christ Himself in the middle of it all. He will be the light, the ruler, the King. This will not be a metaphorical presence, but the most vivid, actual, tangible presence any of us has ever known. How it will all work is veiled in mystery, but what the book of Revelation labors to make plain is that when Christ ushers in His eternal kingdom, it will be real, eternal, glorious, and perfect.\nAnd it will be the perfect conclusion to the unfolding drama of the human story—the fall of humanity undone by the finished work of Christ. On that day, all of God’s people will be restored to face-to-face relationship with our Creator God, the one we were meant to know and enjoy forever. This is what’s coming. To God be the glory.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I am a pastor, and every week in our church we come to the communion table. Though I sometimes feel an internal pressure to try to keep my words fresh and the invitation to the table interesting, I find that I return to a few key ideas that I express in roughly the same way every week. One of those truths comes from today’s text.\nAs we prepare to rise from our seats to come forward to receive the bread and cup, I remind the congregation that this table won’t last forever. One day, the communion table will become a relic of a bygone era—something we used to do. Why? Because of what we read in Revelation 19:6–10. The communion table will be replaced by the marriage supper of the Lamb. Instead of a single bite and tiny sip, a feast will spread out before us. Instead of having our appetites awakened by the tease of the bread and cup, we will have our appetites satisfied by an unimaginable banquet spread, never to hunger again.\nThe host of the meal will be the same—Christ Jesus. And the people gathered around the table will also be the same—all believers everywhere. But the nature and meaning of the meal will shift, or maybe a better way to say it is that it will reach its fulfillment.\nChristians are a people in waiting, a Bride expecting the final return of the Bridegroom. Now we gather in worship, come to the communion table, and pray as our Lord taught us: “Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10). But one day, Christ will come, and His return will kick off a wedding feast the likes of which this world has never seen.\nThe Church is the Bride, and because of Christ we are clothed in purity, with nothing held against us, nothing preventing us from looking our Redeemer fully in the eye. It is difficult—no, impossible—to fully imagine His coming glory from where we’re sitting now. But when John heard the angel describe it, he fell down in awe. Imagine what it will be like in person!\nThe communion table is not the only thing that will reach the end of its usefulness. So will our wandering, our duplicitous hearts, our finicky appetites, and our wavering devotion. We will be changed, draped in the glory of Christ, and given a place in His eternal presence as His beloved. If you are a believer in Christ, there is no reality more certain than this.\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    In the fall of 2008, I was a senior in high school applying to colleges and looking for scholarships. Right before Christmas, I decided to attend a private Christian college near my hometown instead of a public state university a few hours away. I knew that the Christian college was going to be a lot more expensive, but my parents said that as long as I earned enough scholarship money, they would be able to afford it.\nThen, in January 2009, just a few months after I’d decided to attend the expensive school instead of the more cost-effective one, my dad lost his job. He had worked at IBM for more than 25 years. Why did a manager at one of the top companies in the world lose his job in 2009? The same reason a lot of his peers did: the Great Recession.\nThe recession of 2008–2009 affected the lives of millions of Americans. Over the course of the recession, nearly nine million Americans lost their jobs, and about 818,000 of them lost their jobs in a single month—January 2009, when my dad lost his.\nThe Great Recession showed America and the world that even the biggest companies can be toppled by forces beyond their control. No one is untouchable. Revelation 18 reminds us of a similar truth. Even the greatest worldly powers will not stand against the rule and reign of Almighty God when all is said and done.\nThe prostitute in Revelation 17 is now called “Babylon the Great” here in Revelation 18. And it is in this chapter that John tells us of her demise. He says, “Then I heard another voice from heaven: ‘Come out of her, my people, so that you will not share in her sins or receive any of her plagues. For her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes’” (vv.4–5).\nRegardless of what we may believe about the literal meaning of Babylon the Great, this principle is true: the fall of Babylon shows us that even the strongest, most powerful worldly structures will crumble and fall at the feet of Jesus.\nBabylon opposed the work of Christ in the world. In human terms, Babylon seems impenetrable and all-powerful. Yet, when God pours out His wrath, even this seemingly invincible entity cannot bear the weight.\nWe must resist the temptation to seize power and control in the world around us as an act of disobedience to God our Father. In our sin, we will be tempted to build our own empires in our lives, ones we want to rule apart from, and therefore in opposition to, the rule and reign of God. But no system we create, business we launch, or family we grow is more important than the family and mission of God.\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

In the wrong hands, it can be dangerous, even deadly. But if the one wielding power is good, trustworthy, and just, incredible things are possible. In his book, Playing God, Andy Crouch states that power is “both better and worse than we could imagine… Power, the truest servant of love, can also be its most implacable enemy.”\nAs human beings, we often crave power, because with power comes control. With control comes the ability, or, perhaps more appropriately, the illusion of the ability to determine our life’s outcomes. We believe a lie that says the more power we acquire, the more likely we are to achieve our own idea of success, whatever that may be. The problem is, seizing power to yield success doesn’t ever work out the way we think it should. Our sinful hearts want to hijack that power for our own gain, however pure we believe our motives. Revelation 17 shows us how this story ends.\nWithout getting caught up in the identity of the prostitute, the beast, or the meanings of their descriptions. What’s important for us to take away from Revelation 17 is this: Worldly power is dangerous, and our pursuit of it can lead to our ultimate destruction. Too often, our pursuit of power is rooted in selfish purposes.\nWe want power to gain money.\nWe want power to gain control.\nWe want power to make life easier.\nWe want power to gain fame.\nWe want power to benefit ourselves instead of others.\nGod demonstrated His power by sending His Son to die for us. The most powerful action in the history of the universe is seen in Jesus’s death and resurrection. He took the throne by dying, not killing.\nOur understanding of how power is acquired and our reasons for wanting it are both warped by our sin. If we pursue power for ourselves through worldly means, it will be our destruction. By “winning” in this way, we will inevitably lose. Worldly power is fleeting and dangerous. But one day Jesus, the Lamb, will conquer all rulers and kingdoms, and His followers will share in His victory. It is through our weakness that Christ’s perfect power is realized (2 Corinthians 12:9–11). It is in His victory that we, too, are victorious. “To him be honor and eternal power. Amen” (1 Timothy 6:16).\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    This time of year always reminds me of the Memorial Day Weekend tornado that hit my Northeast Indiana hometown when I was a kid. Spring and summer brought severe weather to the area from time to time. I remember this tornado because it was one of the only tornado warnings that led us to go to our basement for cover. We were often warned about tornadoes in the springtime, but rarely did those warnings result in an actual tornado on the ground anywhere near our house. This one, however, touched down on one of the major thoroughfares in our small city, about five miles away from my house. It was for real, and the sky was as black as I have ever seen it. I remember looking out my front door toward the direction of the tornado before we shuffled down into the basement.\nTornadoes always make me think of the wrath of God. We don’t see any explicit examples of God using tornadoes in the Bible as a demonstration of His wrath, but we see plenty of examples of Him demonstrating His lordship over creation by how He pours out His wrath on the rebellious. Revelation 15–16 gives us some of the clearest biblical examples this.\nIn chapter 15, John describes a vision in which he sees a group of seven angels with the last seven plagues, through which the wrath of God will be completed (v.1). In addition to those angels, John sees “those who had won the victory over the beast… standing on the sea of glass with harps from God” (v.2). They sang a song to God, telling of His holiness and declaring that all nations will one day come and worship Him. Then out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues in seven bowls, representing the ways God would pour out His wrath on the wicked for a final time.\nThe message of chapter 16 is clear: those who worship anyone but Yahweh will experience the wrath of God. One day, when His wrath is complete, “all the nations will come and worship before [Him]” when His righteous acts are revealed (v.4).\nGod’s righteous wrath displays His majesty and power, and He justly pours it out on all who have rebelled against Him in their worship of other gods. Inherent in each one of us is the desire to worship, but we are too easily satisfied by worshiping something or someone other than God. This sin separates us from the Lord, and it condemns us to experience His wrath instead.\nBut the story doesn’t end there.\nGod’s majesty is also on display in the tremendous sacrificial love He has shown us in the sacrifice of His Son. By sending His Son to live the perfect life we couldn’t live, die the death we deserve to die, and rise from the dead, God’s majesty is displayed in His gracious deliverance of His people. When we trust God and believe that our salvation relies completely on the finished work of Christ and not our future obedience, we are rescued from the wrath of God and freed to live in His presence. Thanks be to God!\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Revelation 14 is a chapter of extremes. It opens with the Lamb standing on Mount Zion with 144,000 men, pure and undefiled, and it ends with God’s enemies being judged, their mingled blood rising to the level of a horse’s bridle for a hundred and eighty square miles. Revelation is a book of symbols and metaphors, so it may be that John’s visions have been painted with a broad brush intentionally. We don’t necessarily have to take every word as a literal depiction of events that have unfolded or may yet unfold.\nFor example, there is nothing in Scripture that requires perpetual virginity in order to be considered clean before God, yet the 144,000 are said to be “ones who have not defiled themselves with women, since they remained virgins” (Revelation 14:4). It could be that virginity is being used as a symbol of devotion to God, something that we should all strive for, regardless of our marital status. The number 144,000 is also likely to be emblematic, since it’s the sum of twelve times twelve times a thousand. Twelve is the number of tribes in Israel and also the number of Jesus’s apostles, and a thousand is often used in Scripture to signify vastness. In addition, it is unlikely that the judgment of the wicked will take place in an actual winepress.\nReading this chapter through, I am struck by how perfectly understandable it all is, despite it being about as clear as mud! What I mean is that even though all the details are mysterious and perplexing, I know exactly where everyone stands. The 144,000 are followers of Jesus, faithful and true. And the grapes harvested and crushed in the winepress of God’s wrath? They’re those who have rejected Christ, who have delighted in wickedness and scoffed at the gospel of peace.\nIt’s fitting that between these two portions of Scripture there is a gospel proclamation delivered by an angel: “He spoke with a loud voice: ‘Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship the one who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water’” (v.7). This angel is followed by two more: one with a declaration of Babylon’s destruction (v.8) and another with a summary of the punishment that will befall all those who worship the beast and take his mark (vv.9–11). There is God and life in the one hand, the beast and death in the other. Despite the confusion that surrounds the symbolism of this chapter, the angels have made the choice before every person quite clear.\nThis same decision stands in front of all the complex issues we face—theological, social, political, and everything in between. Before we answer any other questions, we must answer the most important one: Whose side am I on? The answer to that question will inform all the others, and it’s one we must continue to ask ourselves. It’s no wonder one of the angels says, “This calls for endurance from the saints, who keep God’s commands and their faith in Jesus” (v.12). Brothers, let us endure, for the way we answer this most important of questions has the power to shape every minute of every day for the rest of our lives.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

Back then, she was deeply engaged in popular end-times theology teaching and when she saw the new scanning technology being used, she feared it might somehow be related to the mark of the beast mentioned in Revelation 13:18.\nMy friend smiles at this today, as UPCs have become commonplace and proven themselves to be an innocuous bit of technology that saves us all time at the checkout counter. Even so, for centuries the mysterious reference to the mark, or number, of the beast has left Bible readers scratching their heads.\nMany people have tried to crack the code of six-sixty-six by calculating the names of various world leaders using numbers as stand-ins for letters. Others have seen the number as purely symbolic, representative of evil and chaos. One thing is for certain, the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth described in Revelation 13 are not our friends. They are in league with Satan himself and are intent on bringing harm to humanity.\nOne of the ways they do this is by deceiving people into worshiping the first beast (Revelation 13:8,12). The second beast is even said to perform “great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth” (v.13). If you’re familiar with the Old Testament book of 1 Kings, you’ll recognize that Elijah called down fire from heaven in his showdown with the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18:30–40). At the time, the falling fire was a sign that Yahweh alone was God. But here in Revelation, it is a false prophet who calls down fire from heaven to “prove” the beast from the sea is worthy of worship. It’s no wonder people are deceived!\nAs John writes, “This calls for endurance and faithfulness from the saints” (Revelation 14:12). To stand strong in the midst of such deception, we must be anchored in the Word of God. We need to know the truth so we don’t fall for a lie when it is wrapped in persuasive arguments or false signs and wonders. That’s why it’s so important to be students of the Bible—not just for a season or when it fits into our busy schedules, but every day and for the rest of our lives.\nWe must be immersed in the truth, going deeper and wider all the time. It’s the only way to cultivate a discerning mind in a world bent on drawing us away from Christ. As an added benefit, being rooted in God’s Word will keep us from falling for every end-times fad, whether it’s an updated take on a Y2K scenario, mysterious Bible codes, or the barcode on the bottom of your cereal box.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

His younger brother Jude had begun mixing random toys into our VeggieTales nativity set, including one mean-looking stegosaurus. I didn’t have the heart to tell Jonah there probably weren’t any talking cucumbers in Bethlehem either.\nRevelation 12 doesn’t offer us a typical Christmas scene, but the chapter does include the birth of Christ, and there’s even a dinosaur—er, dragon. John sees a sign in the sky: a woman about to give birth and a fiery red dragon waiting to devour her Child. Clues in the text invite us to see the woman as Israel, the sun, moon, and stars being an early image of God’s people (see Genesis 37:9–11). The Son born to the woman is Jesus, the Messiah. The iron rod is the clue there (see Psalm 2:6–9). Finally, there is the dragon, whom John identifies as “the ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the one who deceives the whole world” (Revelation 12:9).\nJesus’s birth, life, death, resurrection, and ascension unfold quickly—so quickly in fact that a lot of readers miss it (see v.5). Unlike in the Gospels, the Revelation account of Jesus’s ministry is focused not on earth, but on what took place in the unseen realm.\nJesus paid the price for our sins on the cross, and when He walked out of the empty tomb on Easter morning, He triumphed over death. He did these things for us—on our behalf. As a result, the devil no longer has any claim on God’s people, no reason left to accuse us. We have been justified, made clean, forgiven. The price has been paid. As a result, Satan lost his place as prosecutor in God’s heavenly court (vv.8,10). Therefore, the archangel Michael and God’s angel armies waged war against the devil and his angels, and threw them down to earth. Satan has now been forced to change his strategy—from accusing God’s people to waging war against them (v.17).\nThat sounds like bad news at first, doesn’t it? We have an enemy who’ll stop at nothing to destroy us. But that’s not the way John frames it. In the middle of the action he includes a victory cry from heaven:\n“The salvation and the power \nand the kingdom of our God \nand the authority of his Christ \nhave now come, \nbecause the accuser of our brothers and sisters, \nwho accuses them \nbefore our God day and night, \nhas been thrown down” (Revelation 12:10).\nJesus has defeated Satan. Good has triumphed over evil. It’s the end of the story we’ve been waiting for. Only it isn’t the end.\nYou and I live between this great victory and the final battle, after which Satan will be thrown into the lake of fire (20:10). But we have been given this glimpse behind the veil separating heaven and earth so that when we hear the forces of evil roar, we might remember all is not lost. In fact, everything—absolutely everything—has been won, because of what Jesus accomplished. Satan’s time is short (12:12), and our redemption is near.\nWritten by John Greco\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.\nThe idiom is familiar to most of us, as is its meaning: if you depend completely on one thing and that thing doesn’t work out, then you’ve lost everything. The worldly wise spread things around a little—a single egg in this basket, two eggs in that one, a half dozen in this one over here. That way, if something goes wrong—and something usually does go wrong—you’ve got other eggs to fall back on, so to speak.\nMakes sense, doesn’t it? And so we diversify everything from our portfolios to our allegiances. A little faith in family and friends over here, and then maybe a little in politics over there. It just makes sense, except when it comes to God and His kingdom. As the apostle Paul reminds us in 1 Corinthians 3: “For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God” (v.19).\nGod’s Word is clear. One of these days, one that is definitely not confined to our timetables, there will be a sudden realization, when “the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign forever and ever” (Revelation 11:15).\nEverything we just knew was so certain and secure, like nations and kingdoms and political leaders and princes, will be revealed to have been temporary. Their power and rule, which often feels so comprehensive to us, is only effective here and now. Their power has boundaries, like the edges of one of our egg baskets. The kingdom of God, on the other hand, encompasses both heaven and earth. It knows nothing of boundaries or baskets. In fact, when it comes to all the plans of the rulers of the kingdoms of this earth, the psalmist shocks us by writing that “the one enthroned in heaven laughs” (Psalm 2:4).\nWhen it comes to something like our financial eggs, for example, yes—it is wise to diversify. But when it comes to our loyalties, true wisdom means placing our faith in the King who will reign forever. Until His kingdom comes in its fullness, we are to “serve the LORD with reverential awe and rejoice with trembling” (Psalm 2:11).\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    I was raised the first-born son of a Southern Baptist preacher. There was a memorable season in my boyhood when my father preached through the book of Revelation, chapter by chapter, verse by verse. This undertaking was no doubt spurred on by questions his congregation had regarding some popular writings of the era, the 1970s. I remember him delivering passionate sermons backdropped by a huge timeline chart on the wall, which gave structure to the events of the last days.\nWhen I was a boy, I thought as a boy. So most of what I remember of that time is my father’s physical presence behind a pulpit and the incredible imagery of this final book of the Bible. My mind was captured by visions of blood reaching up to a horse’s bridle, seals opened and trumpets blasting, lakes of fire—to name a few. And then there’s this:\n“The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, \nwent up in the presence of God from the angel’s hand” (Revelation 8:4).\nAnd while my father had a particular interpretation of it all, the most important thing impressed upon me was the need to make sure I was on God’s side in the apocalypse. The alternative, to my boy’s mind, was chilling.\nToday, I look at the book of Revelation a bit differently than my dad did back then. But the impression he made on me? I remain held in its grip to this day. I confess I do not understand all that’s going on in John’s vision. Some of it is possibly historical, some possibly literal, some no doubt figurative and poetic, and some of it yet to come to pass. All of it remains quite chilling.\nRegardless of how you approach this book, it’s difficult to deny that everything in the vision moves toward a clear loser and clearer winner. The revelation is God Himself, and here’s the good news: He wins. And here’s one impression we should each walk away with: our only hope—quite literally, in the culmination of all things—is Jesus. It is good to ensure we are on God’s side, not just in the already-has-been or yet-to-come apocalypse, but also in the very real right here and now. And right now, “the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer” (1 Corinthians 15:52). While we wait for His return, we have His ear, His attention. But does He have our hearts?\nFor we know the rest of the story: God wins. The trumpet will blow. And in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet… we will be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:51–52).\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

Forty-eight hours. Even sooner, if I’m willing to pay a little more. This option exists for almost any item imaginable, from roller ball pens to car batteries to groceries. The latest app trends for takeout aren’t just for fast-food but also restaurant fare, delivered right to my door. And how long will this take? Some services have set the bar at less than twenty-eight minutes—just 1,680 seconds. That’s crazy fast. But that’s the world we live in today.\nFifty-eight. That’s the number of people killed in the Las Vegas shooting in 2017. Remember that one? Add to that number the ongoing death and suffering of school shootings, natural disasters, disease and sickness, hunger and poverty, wars and rumors of wars—the tally is overwhelming. We look for something to click, some app to engage with to bring quick relief from the reality of pain, all the king’s horses and men—but there’s nothing. That’s also the world we live in. If we’re honest, it’s gotten a little old; the numbing feels empty. And still we cry, “Lord, how long…? Forever?”\nIt’s hard to hold on to hope in these competing worlds. The easy way out, the broad road? Give in to the one-click reality and numb ourselves as much as possible with whatever we can get. But the narrower way—the way that leads not just to a fix here and there, but to the full redemption of all things, including us—that’s what I call one-day living. It requires a dogged patience and trust in the Lord’s promises that one day, He will make all things right. One day…\nThey will no longer hunger;\nthey will no longer thirst;\nthe sun will no longer strike them,\nnor will any heat.\n– Revelation 7:16\nThat is not the world we live in right now. But it is the world that is coming. We need patience as we await our full redemption, but it’ll be worth the wait. How long will this take? That’s God’s call. Ours is to keep faith and to wait until we see.\nWritten by John Blase\n\n                ",

Sit there and soak in the awkwardness? Make a joke? Sing along? That small moment of super-concentrated attention is just too much. It’s odd to have everyone focused on you and singing to you, about you, for you. But it’s not odd for Jesus.\nThe angels and elders singing to Jesus, about Jesus, and for the glory of Jesus is exactly what Jesus deserves. This moment in Revelation isn’t too big for Him; He is worthy of it and so much more.\nThe apostle John sees what we need to see and believe again and again: Jesus is worthy of all praise, glory, honor, blessing, and power. He is worthy of it all, and He deserves it from all people. Many people are fine saying that Jesus is worthy of affirmation and honor, on the same level as other religious teachers. Revelation 4–5 says otherwise. Jesus is worthy to reign over the universe, bring history to its conclusion, and usher in the new heavens and the new earth. He is worthy of all that is worthy of God.\nAnd there’s more we need to see here.\nJesus is worthy of receiving glory, praise, and honor from us, brothers. Right now. Today, tomorrow, and for the rest of your life on into eternity. Jesus is worthy. Give Him praise. He was slaughtered for your sins, rose in victory, and loves you relentlessly. Anything you detect in your life that is dishonoring to Christ, repent of it today. Turn from it. Relent and give honor to Christ.\nWe may believe that Jesus is worthy, but do we live like we know it is true? All hail the Lamb who takes away our sin!\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

    "devo_summary": "\n                    \n                    Our ideas for what church should be like should not be trusted. At least not totally. We can dream up all kinds of helpful strategies, plans, and programs, but we cannot overlook the all-important question: What does Jesus want for His Church? Today’s reading points us in the right direction.\nJesus dictated these letters to John and wanted them sent to the actual churches in these actual places in Asia Minor. And they stand today as ever-relevant words from Jesus about what He wants in all of His churches—in every place, every time, every nation.\nWhen we think about the kind of church we want to be a part of, what Jesus says in these seven letters should inform our search criteria. As we serve in our local churches, these letters offer the vision we should have for our churches. Jesus’s plan for His Church is far more significant than any conference, book, or pastor’s five-year goals. Jesus bought the Church with His own blood. Your church is His Church.\nSo what does Jesus want us to be?\nChrist wants Christ-centered churches (Letter to Ephesus). He wants churches that will endure the pressure and persecution from the surrounding culture (Letter to Smyrna). He wants churches committed to sound, healthy, biblical doctrine (Letter to Pergamum). The Lord wants churches that don’t minimize sin and worldliness (Letter to Thyatira). The risen Christ wants churches that avoid hypocrisy like we avoid the slow lane on the highway (Letter to Sardis). Jesus wants His churches to hold fast in ministry and endure till the end (Letter to Philadelphia). And finally, Jesus wants His Church to be a repenting Church, one that constantly returns to Him (Letter to Laodicea).\nThese letters are given to specific churches, but they are also for all churches, for all time. That’s why Jesus said, “Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches” (Revelation 2:29). He wants us to listen, to learn, to repent and turn back to Him, our first love (v.4).\nWritten by J.A. Medders\n\n                ",

Remember a time you opened the lid to your grill and the heat cocooned inside slammed into your face. (You probably lost some arm hair too.) Think about that one thunderclap you heard, then felt, in the middle of the night. These events and the vision of Jesus in Revelation chapter 1 all have something in common.\nPower. Awe. Fear.\nThe apostle John’s vision, also known as the Revelation of Jesus Christ, kicks off with exactly that: a vision of Jesus Christ. But this experience of Jesus is different than the one that prompted John to write the Gospel that bears his name. This vision of Jesus is cranked to eleven—eleven-hundred volts of power and glory.\nRevelation opens with a picture of Jesus that should wake us up, jolt us. It ought to make us sit back in awe and lean forward in thanksgiving. The one whose eyes are like a flame of fire (all-seeing), the one who has a sword coming out of this mouth (His words pronounce judgments), and the one whose hair is a brilliant white (totally wise)—He is the one who loves us, who saved us, the one who has made us His own.\nJohn’s vision of the risen Lord Jesus reminds us of something we are prone to forget—Jesus is full-strength God. Just because Jesus was crucified, don’t think He’s a pushover. He’s not weak. He tells us: “I am the First and the Last, and the Living One. I was dead, but look—I am alive forever and ever, and I hold the keys of death and Hades” (Revelation 1:17–18). He is in charge. He alone oversees the living and the dead for all eternity.\nJesus is more than a great speaker. He’s more than some kind of guru who gives out sage advice for how to live well on this planet. He is the First. The Last. It’s all about Him. Is this how you view Jesus? Is this how you treat Jesus? Is this how you worship Jesus? Do you have this kind of faith and trust and dependency on the one whose voice is like the sound of rushing waters? (14:2). Look to Him again.
